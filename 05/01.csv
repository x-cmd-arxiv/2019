domains such as health care, education and sociology. For instance, one could
estimate the impact of a new drug on specific individuals to assist the clinic
plan and improve the survival rate. In this paper, we focus on studying the
problem of estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) from
observational data. The challenges for this problem are two-fold: on the one
hand, we have to derive a causal estimator to estimate the causal quantity from
observational data, where there exists confounding bias; on the other hand, we
have to deal with the identification of CATE when the distribution of
covariates in treatment and control groups are imbalanced. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a neural network framework called Adversarial
Balancing-based representation learning for Causal Effect Inference (ABCEI),
based on the recent advances in representation learning. To ensure the
identification of CATE, ABCEI uses adversarial learning to balance the
distributions of covariates in treatment and control groups in the latent
representation space, without any assumption on the form of the treatment
selection/assignment function. In addition, during the representation learning
and balancing process, highly predictive information from the original
covariate space might be lost. ABCEI can tackle this information loss problem
by preserving useful information for predicting causal effects under the
regularization of a mutual information estimator. The experimental results show
that ABCEI is robust against treatment selection bias, and matches/outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches. Our experiments show promising results on
several datasets, representing different health care domains among others.

properties that incorporates concepts from behavioral types and allows
reasoning about non-functional properties within a sequent calculus. BPL uses
behavioral modalities [s |- {\tau} ], to verify statements s against behavioral

Our calculus for BPL verifies the behavioral specification gradually, as common

classification algorithms are adopted in societally critical domains such as

tackle this problem by learning latent representations of individuals that are
statistically indistinguishable between protected groups while sufficiently
preserving other information for classification. To do that, we develop a
minimax adversarial framework with a generator to capture the data distribution

distributions across different protected groups are similar. Our framework
provides a theoretical guarantee with respect to statistical parity and
individual fairness. Empirical results on four real-world datasets also show
that the learned representation can effectively be used for classification
tasks such as credit risk prediction while obstructing information related to
protected groups, especially when removing protected attributes is not
sufficient for fair classification.

to medical image reconstruction. An increasingly number of publications follow
the concept of embedding the CT reconstruction as a known operator into a
neural network. However, most of the approaches presented lack an efficient CT
reconstruction framework fully integrated into deep learning environments. As a
result, many approaches are forced to use workarounds for mathematically
unambiguously solvable problems. Methods: PYRO-NN is a generalized framework to
embed known operators into the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow.
The current status includes state-of-the-art parallel-, fan- and cone-beam
projectors and back-projectors accelerated with CUDA provided as Tensorflow
layers. On top, the framework provides a high level Python API to conduct FBP
and iterative reconstruction experiments with data from real CT systems.
Results: The framework provides all necessary algorithms and tools to design
end-to-end neural network pipelines with integrated CT reconstruction
algorithms. The high level Python API allows a simple use of the layers as
known from Tensorflow. To demonstrate the capabilities of the layers, the
framework comes with three baseline experiments showing a cone-beam short scan
FDK reconstruction, a CT reconstruction filter learning setup, and a TV
regularized iterative reconstruction. All algorithms and tools are referenced
to a scientific publication and are compared to existing non deep learning
reconstruction frameworks. The framework is available as open-source software
at \url{https://github.com/csyben/PYRO-NN}. Conclusions: PYRO-NN comes with the
prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow and allows to setup end-to-end
trainable neural networks in the medical image reconstruction context. We
believe that the framework will be a step towards reproducible research

gamma rays (VHEGRs). During their propagation in the intergalactic space,
VHEGRs interact with pervasive cosmological photon fields such as the
extragalactic background light (EBL) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB),
producing electron-positron pairs. These pairs can upscatter CMB/EBL photons to
high energies via inverse Compton scattering, thereby continuing the cascade
process. This is often used to set limits on intergalactic magnetic fields
(IGMFs). However, the picture may change if plasma instabilities, arising due
to the interaction of the pairs with the intergalactic medium (IGM), cool down
the electrons/positrons faster than inverse Compton scattering. As a
consequence, the kinetic energy lost by the pairs to the IGM could cause a
hardening in the observed gamma-ray spectrum at energies below $\sim$100 GeV.
Here we study several types and models of instabilities and assess their impact
for interpreting observations of distant blazars. Our results suggest that
plasma instabilities can describe the spectra of some blazars and mimic the
effects of IGMFs, depending on parameters such as intrinsic spectrum of the
object, the density and temperature of the IGM, and the luminosity of the beam.
On the other hand, we find that for our fiducial set of parameters plasma
instabilities do not have a major impact on the spectra of some of the blazars
studied. Therefore, they may be used for constraining IGMFs.

models of galaxy formation and for extracting cosmological information from
current and future weak lensing surveys. The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect,
quantified via the Compton-$y$ parameter, is a powerful tool for studying
feedback, because it directly probes the pressure of the hot, ionized gas
residing in dark matter halos. Cross-correlations between galaxies and maps of
Compton-$y$ obtained from cosmic microwave background surveys are sensitive to
the redshift evolution of the gas pressure, and its dependence on halo mass. In
this work, we use galaxies identified in year one data from the Dark Energy
Survey and Compton-$y$ maps constructed from Planck observations. We find
highly significant (roughly $12\sigma$) detections of galaxy-$y$
cross-correlation in multiple redshift bins. By jointly fitting these
measurements as well as measurements of galaxy clustering, we constrain the
halo bias-weighted, gas pressure of the Universe as a function of redshift
between $0.15 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.75$. We compare these measurements to
predictions from hydrodynamical simulations, allowing us to constrain the

infer users' personal context and information is a well-known privacy threat
that has received significant attention. Efforts towards protection mechanisms
that prevent or limit the success of such threats, however, have been ad-hoc so
far and have primarily focused on designing threat-specific customized defense
mechanisms. Such approaches are not very practical, as evident from their
limited adoption within major mobile/wearable operating systems. In the end, it
is clear that all privacy threats that take advantage of unrestricted access to
zero-permission sensors can be prevented if access to these sensors is
regulated. However, due to the dynamic nature of sensor usage and requirements
of different mobile applications, design of such access control mechanisms is
not trivial. To effectively design an automated mobile defense mechanism that
can dynamically measure the threat level of different sensor access requests
from different applications and appropriately block suspicious requests, the
problem of zero-permission sensor access needs to be first formally defined and
analyzed. This paper accomplishes the above objective by employing game theory,
specifically, signaling games, to analytically model the sensor access scenario
for mobile applications, including, formalizing sensor access strategies of
mobile applications and defense strategies of the on-board defense mechanism
and the associated costs and benefits. Within the confines of a formal and
practical game model, the paper then outlines conditions under which equilibria
can be achieved between entities (applications and defense mechanism) with

media appeals to users due to its fast dissemination of information, low cost,
and easy access. However, social media also enables the widespread of fake
news. Because of the detrimental societal effects of fake news, detecting fake
news has attracted increasing attention. However, the detection performance
only using news contents is generally not satisfactory as fake news is written
to mimic true news. Thus, there is a need for an in-depth understanding on the
relationship between user profiles on social media and fake news. In this
paper, we study the challenging problem of understanding and exploiting user
profiles on social media for fake news detection. In an attempt to understand
connections between user profiles and fake news, first, we measure users'
sharing behaviors on social media and group representative users who are more
likely to share fake and real news; then, we perform a comparative analysis of
explicit and implicit profile features between these user groups, which reveals
their potential to help differentiate fake news from real news. To exploit user
profile features, we demonstrate the usefulness of these user profile features
in a fake news classification task. We further validate the effectiveness of
these features through feature importance analysis. The findings of this work
lay the foundation for deeper exploration of user profile features of social

finite-difference parallel implementation of this formulation, and verify its
accuracy against established planewave and real-space codes. Using this
implementation, we study the band structure and bending properties of X
nanotubes and Xene sheets, respectively. Specifically, we first show that
zigzag and armchair X nanotubes with radii in the range 1 to 5 nm are
semiconducting. In particular, we find an inverse linear dependence of the
bandgap with respect to the radius for all nanotubes, other than the armchair
and zigzag type III carbon variants, for which we find an inverse quadratic
dependence. Next, we exploit the connection between cyclic symmetry and uniform
bending deformations to calculate the bending moduli of Xene sheets in both
zigzag and armchair directions. We find Kirchhoff-Love type bending behavior
for all sheets, with graphene and stanene possessing the largest and smallest

significant anisotropy, with larger bending moduli along the armchair

it implemented and what can be the underlying mechanism providing the
inevitability of death? The hypothesis presented in this paper is based on the
similarity of the human evolution to the evolution of simple discrete nonlinear
fractional (with power-law memory) systems. Caputo fractional/fractional
difference logistic map is a simple discrete system with power-/asymptotically
power-law memory and quadratic nonlinearity. In the area of parameters where
the fixed point is unstable, its evolution starts as the evolution of a system
with a stable fixed point but then this fixed point becomes unstable, suddenly
breaks, and turns into a period two point. Considered under various types of
random perturbations, the time spans of the evolution as a fixed point before
the break (lifespans) obey the Gompertz-Makeham law, which is the observed
distribution of the lifespans of live species, including humans. The underlying
reason for modeling the evolution of humans by fractional systems are the
observed power law in human memory and the viscoelastic nature of organ tissues
of living species. Models with power-law memory may explain the observed
decrease at very large ages of the rate of increase of the force of mortality
and they imply limited lifespans.

to the 4-graviton amplitude in ${\cal N}$$=$ 8 supergravity (SUGRA), with
$\alpha$ being the gravitational coupling and $(s,t)$ the Mandelstam
invariants, is studied in impact parameter ($\rho$) representation. This sector
of the amplitude shows interesting properties which shed light on the nature of
quantum corrections in gravity. Besides having a convergent behaviour as $s$
increases, which is not present in ${\cal N}$$<$ 4 SUGRA theories, there exists
a critical line $\rho_c(s)$ above which the Born amplitude prevails. The short
distance region $\rho < \rho_c(s)$ is dominated by the DL terms. As a
consequence, when studied in terms of an eikonal approach in the forward limit,
the scattering angle linked to the bending of the semiclassical trajectory of
the graviton shows a transition from attractive gravity at large distances to a
region at small $\rho$ characterized by a repulsive DL contribution to the
gravitational potential due to the gravitino content of the theory. In the
complex angular momentum plane, this DL high energy asymptotics is driven by
the rightmost pole singularity of a parabolic cylinder function. The
resummation of DL quantum corrections in ${\cal N}$$=$ 8 SUGRA can be
understood in terms of the counting of 1-rooted maps on orientable surfaces.

  Stragglers","Shorter version accepted in 2019 IEEE International Symposium on
  Information Theory (ISIT)",,,,"cs.IT cs.DC cs.LG math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed implementations of gradient-based methods, wherein a server
distributes gradient computations across worker machines, suffer from slow
running machines, called 'stragglers'. Gradient coding is a coding-theoretic
framework to mitigate stragglers by enabling the server to recover the gradient
sum in the presence of stragglers. 'Approximate gradient codes' are variants of
gradient codes that reduce computation and storage overhead per worker by
allowing the server to approximately reconstruct the gradient sum.
  In this work, our goal is to construct approximate gradient codes that are
resilient to stragglers selected by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our
motivation for constructing codes to mitigate adversarial stragglers stems from
the challenge of tackling stragglers in massive-scale elastic and serverless
systems, wherein it is difficult to statistically model stragglers. Towards
this end, we propose a class of approximate gradient codes based on balanced
incomplete block designs (BIBDs). We show that the approximation error for
these codes depends only on the number of stragglers, and thus, adversarial
straggler selection has no advantage over random selection. In addition, the
proposed codes admit computationally efficient decoding at the server. Next, to
characterize fundamental limits of adversarial straggling, we consider the
notion of 'adversarial threshold' -- the smallest number of workers that an
adversary must straggle to inflict certain approximation error. We compute a
lower bound on the adversarial threshold, and show that codes based on
symmetric BIBDs maximize this lower bound among a wide class of codes, making
them excellent candidates for mitigating adversarial stragglers.

of the material candidates hosting these Majorana vortex modes. It has been
observed by recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurement that the
fraction of vortex cores possessing ZBPs decreases with increasing magnetic
field on the surface of this iron-based superconductor. We construct a
three-dimensional tight-binding model simulating the physics of over a hundred
Majorana vortex modes in FeTe$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ with realistic physical parameters.
Our simulation shows that the Majorana hybridization and disordered vortex
distribution can explain the decreasing fraction of the ZBPs observed in the

analyzed peak statistics in the vortex cores from the experiment. This
agreement and the explanation of the decreasing ZBP fraction lead to an
important indication of scalable Majorana vortex modes in the iron-based

clustering redshifts and Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD) analyses. In
particular, we estimate: the depth dependence of interlopers based on CFHTLS
data and propagate this to biases in cosmology; new inferences of (non-linear)
halo bias at these redshifts and depths using legacy data; detailed forecasts
of LBG spectra as would be observed by DESI, PFS, and their successors. We
further assess the relative competitiveness of potential spectroscopic

traditional selections to the photometric system of LSST where necessary.
  We confirm these science cases to be compelling for achievable facilities in

all of the clouds of ~9.65 Msolar/pc^2, and constitute 2-53% of the total HI
mass of the host galaxy. For individual clouds, the mass including He varies
with cloud radius as log M_{gas} = (2.11\pm0.04)x log R_{cl}+(0.78\pm0.08) and
the internal velocity dispersion varies as log V_{disp} = 0.5xlog
R_{cl}-0.57\pm0.21. The HI clouds tend to be in the outer regions of the
galaxies, with 72% of the galaxies having more than 70% of their clouds outside
one disk scale length, and 32% of the galaxies having more than 50% of their
clouds outside the radius encircling the HII emission. 36% of the clouds are
essentially non-self-gravitating from HI alone, with a virial parameter that
exceeds alpha_{vir}~10, and 5% have alpha_{vir}\le2. We estimate the missing
molecular mass, based on the total star formation rate and a typical molecular
consumption time of 2 Gyr, as observed in CO-rich galaxies. The resulting
molecular fraction has a value averaged over the galaxies of 0.23 and

brings various nuisances including zoom, rotation, blur, viewpoint change, JPEG

we fill the pixel values at the cluster location using a constrained Gaussian
realization based on the information from surrounding regions. We show that the
noise induced due to inpainting process is small compared to other noise
sources for upcoming surveys and has minimal impact on the final lensing

uncertainty of 6.5% for the CMB-S4 experiment on a cluster sample containing
5000 clusters with $M_{200c} = 2 \times 10^{14}\ M_{\odot}$ at z = 0.7. In
addition to the SZ-induced lensing biases, we also quantify the low mass bias
arising due to the contamination of the CMB gradient by the cluster
convergence. For the fiducial cluster sample considered in this work, we find
that bias is negligible compared to the statistical uncertainties for both the
standard and the modified QE even when modes up to $\sim 2700$ are used for the
gradient estimation. With more gradient modes, we demonstrate that the
sensitivity can be increased by 14% compared to the fiducial result above with

expansion of the effective action of type IIB superstring theory with constant

$q_U$ units. These interactions have coefficients that transform as
non-holomorphic modular forms under $SL(2, {\mathbb Z})$ transformations with
holomorphic and anti-holomorphic weights $(w,-w)$, where $q_U=-2w$.
  In this paper $SL(2, {\mathbb Z})$-covariance and supersymmetry are used to
determine first-order differential equations on moduli space that relate the
modular form coefficients of classes of BPS-protected maximal $U(1)$-violating
interactions that arise at low orders in the low-energy expansion. These are
the moduli-dependent coefficients of BPS interactions of the form $d^{2p}
\mathcal{P}_n$ in linearised approximation, where $\mathcal{P}_n$ is the
product of $n$ fields that has dimension $=8$ with $q_U=8-2n$, and $p=0$, $2$
or $3$. These first-order equations imply that the coefficients satisfy $SL(2,
{\mathbb Z})$-covariant Laplace eigenvalue equations on moduli space with
solutions that contain information concerning perturbative and non-perturbative
contributions to superstring amplitudes. For $p=3$ and $n\ge 6$ there are two
independent modular forms, one of which has a vanishing tree-level
contribution.
  The analysis of super-amplitudes for $U(1)$-violating processes involving
arbitrary numbers of external fluctuations of the complex modulus leads to a
diagrammatic derivation of the first-order differential relations and Laplace
equations satisfied by the coefficient modular forms. Combining this with a
$SL(2, {\mathbb Z})$-covariant soft axio-dilaton limit that relates amplitudes
with different values of $n$ determines most of the modular invariant
coefficients, leaving a single undetermined constant.

larger fraction of big grains than in the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium
(ISM). Possible origins include coalescence of small grains, small grain
growth, selective destruction of small grains, and fresh injection of big
grains. From a study of the ultraviolet extinction properties of three massive
stars in the 30 Dor nebula (R139, R140, R145), observed with the International
Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), we show that the excess of big grains does not come
at the expense of small grains, which are still present and possibly even more
abundant. Fresh injection of large grains appears the dominant mechanism. A
process able to naturally account for this in environments such as the
Tarantula nebula, where formation of massive stars has been ongoing for over
~20 Myr, is the explosion of massive stars as type-II supernovae (SN). The
ensuing change in the conditions of the ISM is only temporary, lasting less
than ~100 Myr, because shattering and shocks will eventually break and destroy
the bigger grains. However, this is the only time when star-forming regions are
detectable as such in starburst and high-redshift galaxies and we highlight the
complexity inherent in interpreting observations of star-forming regions in
these environments. If the extinction characteristics are not known properly,
any attempts to derive quantitative physical parameters are bound to fail.

significant deviations of all examined scaling relations from the simple
self-similar expectations. While the slopes are approximately independent of
redshift, the normalisations evolve positively with respect to self-similarity,
even for commonly-used mass proxies such as the $Y_{\mathrm{X}}$ parameter.
These deviations are due to a combination of factors, including more effective
AGN feedback in lower mass haloes, larger binding energy of gas at a given halo
mass at higher redshifts and larger non-thermal pressure support from kinetic
motions at higher redshifts. Our results have important implications for
cluster cosmology from upcoming SZ surveys such as SPT-3G, ACTpol and CMB-S4,
as relatively small changes in the observable--mass scaling relations (within
theoretical uncertainties) have a large impact on the predicted number of
high-redshift clusters and hence on our ability to constrain cosmology using
cluster abundances. In addition, we find that the intrinsic scatter of the
relations, which agrees well with most observational constraints, increases at
lower redshifts and for lower mass systems. This calls for a more complex

Observationally, however, the sub-mm continuum emission is dominated by the
dust, which also drifts inwards, complicating the picture. In this paper we
investigate, using theoretical models of dust grain growth and radial drift,
how the radii of dusty viscous proto-planetary discs evolve with time. Despite
the existence of a sharp outer edge in the dust distribution, we find that the
radius enclosing most of the dust $\textit{mass}$ increases with time, closely
following the evolution of the gas radius. This behaviour arises because,
although dust initially grows and drifts rapidly onto the star, the residual
dust retained on Myr timescales is relatively well coupled to the gas.
Observing the expansion of the dust disc requires using definitions based on
high fractions of the disc $\textit{flux}$ (e.g. 95 per cent) and very long
integrations with ALMA, because the dust grains in the outer part of the disc
are small and have a low sub-mm opacity. We show that existing surveys lack the
sensitivity to detect viscous spreading. The disc radii they measure do not
trace the mass radius or the sharp outer edge in the dust distribution, but the
outer limit of where the grains have significant sub-mm opacity. We predict
that these observed radii should shrink with time.

have shown in a companion paper that the observed disc radii trace where the

the observed correlation emerges naturally if the maximum grain size is set by
radial drift, implying relatively low values of the viscous $\alpha$ parameter
$ \lesssim 0.001$. In this case the relation has an almost universal
normalisation, while if the grain size is set by fragmentation the flux at a
given radius depends on the dust-to-gas ratio. We highlight two observational
consequences of the fact that radial drift limits the grain size. The first is
that the dust masses measured from the sub-mm could be overestimated by a
factor of a few. The second is that the correlation should be present also at
longer wavelengths (e.g. 3mm), with a normalisation factor that scales as the
square of the observing frequency as in the optically thick case.

dark matter model, which was originally invented to explain the similarity of
the dark and visible cosmological matter densities. This occurs in the model
irrespective of the axion mass $m_\mathrm{a}$ or initial misalignment angle
$\theta_0$. Annihilation of antimatter AQNs with visible matter inevitably
produce axions when AQNs hit Earth. The emission rate of axions with velocities
below escape velocity is very tiny compared to the overall emission, however
these axions will be accumulated over the 4.5 billion year life time of the
Earth, which greatly enhances the discovery potential. We perform numerical
simulations with a realistically modeled incoming AQN velocity and mass
distribution, and explore how AQNs interact as they travel through the interior
of the Earth. We use this to estimate the axion flux on the surface of the
Earth, the velocity-spectral features of trapped axions, the typical
annihilation pattern of AQN, and the density profile of the axion halo around
the Earth. Knowledge of these properties is necessary to make predictions for

the amplified image really consists of two unresolved images with slightly
different light-travel times. The difference (of order a microsecond) is GM/c^3
times a dimensionless factor depending on the total magnification. Since
magnification is well-measured in microlensing events, a single time-delay

challenge is to find an observable that varies on sub-microsecond time scales.
This paper notes that the narrow-band intensity of the unresolved image pair
will show photon bunching (the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect), and argues that
the lensed intensity will have an auto-correlation peak at the lensing time
delay. The ultrafast photon-counting technology needed for this type of

dynamics nonadiabatic with respect to the electronic degrees of freedom. We
treat these strongly coupled modes by evolving their wavepacket dynamics in the
absence of additional coupling exactly. The remaining weakly coupled nuclear
degrees of freedom are partitioned into modes that are fast relative to the
nonadiabatic coupling and those that are slow. The fast degrees of freedom can
be traced out and treated with second-order perturbation theory in the form of
the time-convolutionless master equation. The slow degrees of freedom are
assumed to be frozen over the ultrafast relaxation, and treated as sources of
static disorder. In this way, we adopt the recently developed frozen-mode
extension to second-order quantum master equations. We benchmark this approach
to numerically exact results in models of pyrazine internal conversion and
rhodopsin photoisomerization. We use this framework to study the dependence of
the quantum yield on the reorganization energy and the characteristic timescale
of the bath, in a two-mode model of photoisomerization. We find that the yield
is monotonically increasing with reorganization energy for a Markovian bath,
but monotonically decreasing with reorganization energy for a non-Markovian
bath. This reflects the subtle interplay between dissipation and decoherence in
conical intersection dynamics in the condensed phase.

calculations left to do. We compute a multivariable generalization of the Exton
function. This generalized Exton function, together with the group theoretic

affected by recombination of hydrogen that takes place in their envelopes. In
this work, we analytically investigate the transition from a fully ionized
envelope to a partially recombined one and its effects on the SN light curve.
The motivation is to establish the underlying processes that dominate the
evolution at late times when recombination takes place in the envelope, yet
early enough so that $^{56}$Ni decay is a negligible source of energy. We
consider the diffusion of photons through the envelope while analyzing the
ionization fraction and the coupling between radiation and gas, and find that
the main effect of recombination is on the evolution of the observed
temperature. Before recombination the temperature decreases relatively fast,
while after recombination starts it significantly reduces the rate at which the
observed temperature drops with time. This behaviour is the main cause for the
observed flattening in the optical bands, where for a typical red supergiant
explosion, the recombination wave affects the bolometric luminosity only mildly
during most of the photospheric phase. Moreover, the plateau phase observed in
some type-II SNe is not a generic result of recombination, and it also depends
on the density structure of the progenitor. This is one possible explanation to
the different light curve decay rates observed in type II (P and L) SNe.

(STOC 2019) give a $(38+\ve)$-approximation algorithm for this problem via a

first carefully reducing this problem (in a series of steps) to a problem

thresholds for the detection of nuclear recoil to below
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{keV})$. While impressive progress has been made on this
front, light dark matter remains the least constrained region of dark-matter
parameter space. It has been shown that both ionization and excitation due to
the Migdal effect and coherently-emitted photon bremsstrahlung from the
recoiling atom can provide observable channels for light dark matter that would
otherwise have been missed owing to the resulting nuclear recoil falling below
the detector threshold. In this paper we extend previous work by calculating
the Migdal effect and photon bremmstrahlung rates for a general set of
interaction types, including those that are momentum-independent or -dependent,
spin-independent or -dependent, as well as examining the rates for a variety of
target materials, allowing us to place new experimental limits on some of these
interaction types. Additionally, we include a calculation of these effects
induced by the coherent scattering on nuclei of solar or atmospheric neutrinos.
We demonstrate that the Migdal effect dominates over the bremsstrahlung effect
for all targets considered for interactions induced by either dark matter or
neutrinos. This reduces photon bremsstrahlung to irrelevancy for future direct
detection experiments.

workshop was to bring together experts and those interested in measuring QED in
the presence of strong fields at and above the Schwinger critical field. The
pioneering experiment, E144 at SLAC, measured multi-photon absorption in
Compton scattering and $e^+e^-$ pair production in electron--photon
interactions but never reached the Schwinger critical field value. With the
advances in laser technology, in particular, new experiments are being
considered which should be able to measure non-perturbative QED and its
transition from the perturbative regime. This workshop reviewed the physics
case and current theoretical predictions for QED and even effects beyond the
Standard Model in the interaction of a high-intensity electron bunch with the
strong field of the photons from a high-intensity laser bunch. The world's
various electron beam facilities were reviewed, along with the challenges of
producing and delivering laser beams to the interaction region. Possible
facilities and sites that could host such experiments were presented, with a
view to experimentally realising the Schwinger critical field in the lab during
the 2020s.

online sequence of $n$ items of different sizes in the range $(0,1]$; a bin is
said to be covered if it receives items of total size at least 1. We study this
problem in the advice setting and provide tight bounds for the size of advice
required to achieve optimal solutions. Moreover, we show that any algorithm
with advice of size $o(\log \log n)$ has a competitive ratio of at most 0.5. In
other words, advice of size $o(\log \log n)$ is useless for improving the
competitive ratio of 0.5, attainable by an online algorithm without advice.
This result highlights a difference between the bin covering and the bin
packing problems in the advice model: for the bin packing problem, there are
several algorithms with advice of constant size that outperform online
algorithms without advice. Furthermore, we show that advice of size $O(\log
\log n)$ is sufficient to achieve a competitive ratio that is arbitrarily close
to $0.53\bar{3}$ and hence strictly better than the best ratio $0.5$ attainable
by purely online algorithms. The technicalities involved in introducing and

Finally, we show that a linear number of bits of advice is necessary to achieve
any competitive ratio better than 15/16 for the online bin covering problem.

  in Corfu 2018",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We interpret anomalies, deviations, from the standard model as being in fact
due to effects not given by perturbation, because the top Yukawa coupling is
after all so large that not by perturbation effects become important. Most of
the anomalies found have the character of signaling violation of lepton
universality. There are four lepton universality violating anomalies known at
present, which we shall fit with one overall scale parameter to order of
magnitude accuracy. One can look at the picture that we have found - due to the
rather strong top Yukawa coupling - as a new sector of strongly interacting
particles analogous to quantum color dynamics inside the standard model! In
addition we treat what is presumably also an anomaly: the experimental value of
the direct charge conjugation parity violation parameter epsilon prime over
epsilon turns out to be a factor 2 or more larger than the standard model
prediction,but fit our model. However if we include in our anomaly model such
processes not involving leptons (but only quarks), it seems superficially that
we obtain very large - and unacceptable - anomalies in meson zero meson zero
bar etc. mixing. To rescue our model from this falsification, we think of the
interacting quarks as provided with clouds (on half terra electron volt scale)
of, and that too strongly interacting such clouds cannot penetrate into each
other. Thereby the interactions and thus the resulting anomalies are damped.
Even with such a crutch for our theory we only barely manage to avoid an
overlarge anomaly in the indirect charge conjugation parity violation parameter
epsilon. Our modified model also predicts an anomalous contribution to the
meson long to meson short mass difference of the same order of magnitude as the
experimental value, which is consistent with the deviation from the standard
model lattice value.

ensemble approaches have also been empirically shown to yield robust measures
of uncertainty, and are capable of distinguishing between different
\emph{forms} of uncertainty. However, ensembles come at a computational and
memory cost which may be prohibitive for many applications. There has been
significant work done on the distillation of an ensemble into a single model.
Such approaches decrease computational cost and allow a single model to achieve
an accuracy comparable to that of an ensemble. However, information about the
\emph{diversity} of the ensemble, which can yield estimates of different forms
of uncertainty, is lost. This work considers the novel task of \emph{Ensemble
Distribution Distillation} (EnD$^2$) --- distilling the distribution of the
predictions from an ensemble, rather than just the average prediction, into a
single model. EnD$^2$ enables a single model to retain both the improved
classification performance of ensemble distillation as well as information
about the diversity of the ensemble, which is useful for uncertainty
estimation. A solution for EnD$^2$ based on Prior Networks, a class of models
which allow a single neural network to explicitly model a distribution over
output distributions, is proposed in this work. The properties of EnD$^2$ are
investigated on both an artificial dataset, and on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and
TinyImageNet datasets, where it is shown that EnD$^2$ can approach the
classification performance of an ensemble, and outperforms both standard DNNs

two orders of magnitude faster and was less decelerated by rule increase than
the other two implementations used in this study for comparison. Additionally,
FastContext consistently gained accuracy improvement as the rules increased

reducing congestion and pollution. Demand-aware design is a promising avenue
for addressing a critical challenge in ride-sharing systems, namely joint
optimization of request-vehicle assignment and routing for a fleet of vehicles.
In this paper, we develop a probabilistic demand-aware framework to tackle the
challenge. We focus on maximizing the expected number of passenger pickups,
given the probability distributions of future demands. The key idea of our
approach is to assign requests to vehicles in a probabilistic manner. It
differentiates our work from existing ones and allows us to explore a richer
design space to tackle the request-vehicle assignment puzzle with a performance
guarantee but still keeping the final solution practically implementable. The
optimization problem is non-convex, combinatorial, and NP-hard in nature. As a
key contribution, we explore the problem structure and propose an elegant
approximation of the objective function to develop a dual-subgradient
heuristic. We characterize a condition under which the heuristic generates a
$\left(1-1/e\right)$ approximation solution. Our solution is simple and
scalable, amendable for practical implementation. Results of numerical
experiments based on real-world traces in Manhattan show that, as compared to a
conventional demand-oblivious scheme, our demand-aware solution improves the
passenger pickups by up to 46%. The results also show that joint optimization
at the fleet level leads to 19% more pickups than that by separate
optimizations at individual vehicles.

paper, we give a new construction of such an HSG assuming that we have an
explicit polynomial of sufficient hardness. Formally, we prove the following
over any field of characteristic zero:
  Let $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\delta > 0$ be arbitrary constants. Suppose
$\{P_d\}_{d\in \mathbb{N}}$ is an explicit family of $k$-variate polynomials
such that $\operatorname{deg} P_d = d$ and $P_d$ requires algebraic circuits of

derandomization of polynomial identity testing (PIT) for general circuits from
a suitable algebraic hardness assumption. As a direct consequence, we show that
even saving a single point from the ""trivial"" explicit, exponential sized
hitting sets for constant-variate polynomials of low individual degree which
are computable by small circuits, implies a deterministic polynomial time
algorithm for PIT. More precisely, we show the following:

every $s$ large enough, there is an explicit hitting set of size at most
$((s+1)^k - 1)$ for the class of $k$-variate polynomials of individual degree
$s$ that are computable by size $s^\delta$ circuits. Then there is an explicit
hitting set of size $\operatorname{poly}(s)$ for the class of $s$-variate
polynomials, of degree $s$, that are computable by size $s$ circuits.
  As a consequence, we give a deterministic polynomial time construction of
hitting sets for algebraic circuits, if a strengthening of the

utilizes dual basis functions to discretize the Lagrange multiplier spaces. In
order to preserve the sparsity of the coupled problem, we develop a dual mortar
suitable $C^1$ constraint and utilize the B\'ezier dual basis to discretize the
Lagrange multiplier spaces. The B\'ezier dual basis functions are constructed
through B\'ezier projection and possess the same support size as the
corresponding B-spline basis functions. We prove that this approach leads to a
well-posed discrete problem and specify requirements to achieve optimal

$\rho_{de}$ can be dynamical and appear as a power series expansion of the
Hubble rate (and its derivatives), i.e.$\rho_{de}(H,\dot{H},...)$. For the
present universe, however, only the terms $H$, $\dot{H}$ and $H^2$ can be
relevant, together with an additive constant term. We fit these models to the
current cosmological data on the main observables SNIa+$H(z)$+BAO+LSS+CMB+BBN.
Our analysis involves both the background as well as the cosmic perturbation
equations. The latter include, apart from the matter density perturbations,
also the DE density perturbations. We assume that matter and dynamical DE are
separately self-conserved. As a result the equation of state of the DE becomes
a nontrivial function of the cosmological redshift, $w_D=w_D(z)$. The
particular subset of DE models of this type having no additive constant term in
$\rho_{de}$ include the so-called entropic-force and QCD-ghost DE models, as
well as the pure linear model $\rho_{de} \sim H$ all of which are strongly
disfavored in our fitting analysis. In contrast, the models that include the
additive term plus one or both of the dynamical components $\dot{H}$ and $H^2$
appear more favored than the $\Lambda$CDM. In particular, the dynamical DE
models provide a value of $\sigma_8\simeq 0.74-0.77$ which is substantially
lower than that of the $\Lambda$CDM and hence more in accordance with the
observations. This helps to significantly reduce the $\sigma_8$-tension in the
structure formation data. At the same time the predicted value for $H_0$ is in

we first train deep learning models via transfer learning on malware images,
demonstrate high classification effectiveness, apply an explanation method on

the algorithmic insights are consistent with security domain expertise. In our

out is critical for the adoption of mmWave technologies. This is particularly
crucial because mmWave transceivers are equipped with large antenna arrays to
combat severe path losses, which consequently creates large channel matrices,
whose estimation may incur significant overhead. This paper focuses on the
mmWave channel estimation problem. Our objective is to reduce the number of
measurements required to reliably estimate the channel. Specifically, channel
estimation is posed as a ""source compression"" problem in which measurements
mimic an encoded (compressed) version of the channel. Decoding the observed
measurements, a task which is traditionally computationally intensive, is
performed using a deep-learning-based approach, facilitating a high-performance
channel discovery. Our solution not only outperforms state-of-the-art
compressed sensing methods, but it also determines the lower bound on the
number of measurements required for reliable channel discovery.

commonly occur in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks
difficult. These challenges are especially prevalent in the healthcare domain,
where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected at different
frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections
in equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these
issues differently, often handling missing data through mean value imputation
and then using sequence models over the multivariate signals while ignoring the
different resolution of signals. We propose a unified model named
Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The
building block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an
informative dense representation at each time step using signal information
such as last observed value, time difference since the last observed time stamp
and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT which
also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating
the informative dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses
multiple FIT networks for sets of signals with different resolutions, further
facilitating the construction of flexible representations. Our model has three
main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates
informative representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating
task-specific representations b.) it models the relationship between different
signals in the form of support signals c.) it models different resolutions in
parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V and
Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three
predictive tasks, including the forecasting of patient survival.

signals (functions) from linear measurements, often in the form of integral
transforms such as the Fourier transform. This framework is well-suited to many
real-world inverse problems, which are typically modelled in
infinite-dimensional spaces, and where the application of finite-dimensional
approaches can lead to noticeable artefacts. Another typical feature of such
problems is that the signals are not only sparse in some dictionary, but
possess a so-called local sparsity in levels structure. Consequently, the
sampling scheme should be designed so as to exploit this additional structure.
In this paper, we introduce a series of uniform recovery guarantees for
infinite-dimensional compressed sensing based on sparsity in levels and
so-called multilevel random subsampling. By using a weighted
$\ell^1$-regularizer we derive measurement conditions that are sharp up to log
factors, in the sense they agree with those of certain oracle estimators. These
guarantees also apply in finite dimensions, and improve existing results for
unweighted $\ell^1$-regularization. To illustrate our results, we consider the
problem of binary sampling with the Walsh transform using orthogonal wavelets.
Binary sampling is an important mechanism for certain imaging modalities.
Through carefully estimating the local coherence between the Walsh and wavelet
bases, we derive the first known recovery guarantees for this problem.

forces and joint torques applied by a grasp change in response to external
disturbances applied to the grasped object. For example, nonbackdrivable
actuators (e.g. highly geared servos) will passively resist external
disturbances without an actively applied command; for numerous robot hands
using such motors, these effects can be highly beneficial as they increase
grasp resistance without requiring active control. We introduce a grasp
stability analysis method that can model these effects, and, for a given grasp,
distinguish between disturbances that will be passively resisted and those that
will not. We find that, in order to achieve this, the grasp model must include
accurate energetic constraints. One way to achieve this is to consider the
Maximum Dissipation Principle (MDP), a part of the Coulomb friction model that
is rarely used in grasp stability analysis. However, the MDP constraints are
non-convex, and difficult to solve efficiently. We thus introduce a convex
relaxation method, along with an algorithm that successively refines this
relaxation locally in order to obtain solutions to arbitrary accuracy
efficiently. Our resulting algorithm can determine if a grasp is passively

investigations with Schwinger-Dyson equations, the functional renormalization

number of (reducible) flavors $N^{\mathrm{c}}$ exists, below which chiral
symmetry can be broken spontaneously. Values for $N^{\mathrm{c}}$ found in the
literature vary between $2$ and $7$. Recent lattice studies with chirally

integer flavor numbers [Wellegehausen et al., 2017]. An independent simulation
based on domain wall fermions seems to favor a critical flavor-number that
satisfies $1<N^{\mathrm{c}}<2$ [Hands, 2018]. However, in the latter
simulations difficulties in reaching the massless limit in the broken phase (at
strong coupling and after the $L_s\to\infty$ limit has been taken) are
encountered. To find an accurate value $N^{\mathrm{c}}$ we study the Thirring
model (by using an analytic continuation of the parity even theory to arbitrary

condensate, the spectral density of the Dirac operator, the spectrum of
(would-be) Goldstone bosons and the variation of the filling-factor and
conclude that the critical flavor number is $N^{\mathrm{c}}=0.80(4)$. Thus we
see no chiral symmetry breaking in all Thirring models with $1$ or more flavors

demonstrated that massive black holes are common and that their masses strongly
correlate with the stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\star}$ of the bulge.
This correlation suggests that massive black holes and galaxies influence each
other's growth. Dynamical measurements are less reliable when the sphere of
influence is unresolved, thus it remains unknown whether this correlation
exists in galaxies much smaller than the Milky Way, as well as what fraction of
these galaxies have central black holes. Light echoes from photoionized clouds
around accreting black holes, in combination with the velocity of these clouds,
yield a direct mass measurement that circumvents this difficulty. Here we
report an exceptionally low reverberation delay of $83\pm14$ minutes between
variability in the accretion disk and high velocity H$\alpha$ emission from the
nucleus of the bulgeless dwarf galaxy NGC~4395. Combined with the H$\alpha$
line-of-sight velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm line}=426\pm1$~km~s$^{-1}$, this
lag determines a mass of about 10,000~$M_{\odot}$ for the black hole. This mass
is among the smallest central black hole masses reported, near the low end of
expected masses for heavy ""seeds"", and the best direct mass measurement for a
galaxy of this size. Despite the lack of a bulge, NGC~4395 is consistent with
the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_{\star}$ relation when $\sigma_{\star}$ is measured
from the central region. This indicates that the relation need not originate
from hierarchical galaxy assembly nor from black hole feedback.

allocation pipelines, computer scientists have been unwittingly cast as partial
social planners. Given this state of affairs, important questions follow. What
is the relationship between fairness as defined by computer scientists and
notions of social welfare? In this paper, we present a welfare-based analysis
of classification and fairness regimes. We translate a loss minimization
program into a social welfare maximization problem with a set of implied
welfare weights on individuals and groups--weights that can be analyzed from a
distribution justice lens. In the converse direction, we ask what the space of
possible labelings is for a given dataset and hypothesis class. We provide an
algorithm that answers this question with respect to linear hyperplanes in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ that runs in $O(n^dd)$. Our main findings on the relationship
between fairness criteria and welfare center on sensitivity analyses of
fairness-constrained empirical risk minimization programs. We characterize the
ranges of $\Delta \epsilon$ perturbations to a fairness parameter $\epsilon$
that yield better, worse, and neutral outcomes in utility for individuals and
by extension, groups. We show that applying more strict fairness criteria that
are codified as parity constraints, can worsen welfare outcomes for both
groups. More generally, always preferring ""more fair"" classifiers does not
abide by the Pareto Principle---a fundamental axiom of social choice theory and
welfare economics. Recent work in machine learning has rallied around these
notions of fairness as critical to ensuring that algorithmic systems do not
have disparate negative impact on disadvantaged social groups. By showing that
these constraints often fail to translate into improved outcomes for these
groups, we cast doubt on their effectiveness as a means to ensure justice.

spectral clustering to supervise the training of the feature learning module

collaboratively achieve fine-grained three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming

planet is detected with a very strong signal of $\Delta\chi^2\sim 4630$, but
the interpretation of the signal suffers from two types of degeneracies. One
type is caused by the previously known close/wide degeneracy, and the other is
caused by an ambiguity between two solutions, in which one solution requires to
incorporate finite-source effects, while the other solution is consistent with
a point-source interpretation. Although difficult to be firmly resolved based
on only the photometric data, the degeneracy is resolved in strong favor of the
point-source solution with the additional external information obtained from
astrometric and spectroscopic observations. The small astrometric offset
between the source and baseline object supports that the blend is the lens and
this interpretation is further secured by the consistency of the spectroscopic
distance estimate of the blend with the lensing parameters of the point-source
solution. The estimated mass of the host is $1.0\pm 0.1~M_\odot$ and the mass
of the planet is $4.5\pm 0.6~M_{\rm J}$ (close solution) or $4.8\pm 0.6~M_{\rm
J}$ (wide solution) and the lens is located at a distance of $3.2\pm 0.5$~kpc.
The bright nature of the lens, with $I\sim 17.1$ ($V\sim 18.2$), combined with
its dominance of the observed flux suggest that radial-velocity (RV) follow-up
observations of the lens can be done using high-resolution spectrometers
mounted on large telescopes, e.g., VLT/ESPRESSO, and this can potentially not
only measure the period and eccentricity of the planet but also probe for
close-in planets. We estimate that the expected RV amplitude would be $\sim
60\sin i ~{\rm m~s}^{-1}$.

computational imaging platforms aimed at achieving simple and compact optical
arrangements. A recent important class of such platforms is Fourier
ptychography, which is geared towards efficiently creating gigapixel images
with high resolution and large field of view (FOV). In current FP
implementations, pupil aberration is often recovered at each small segment of
the entire FOV. This reconstruction strategy fails to consider the
field-dependent nature of the optical pupil. Given the power series expansion
of the wavefront aberration, the spatially varying pupil can be fully
characterized by tens of coefficients over the entire FOV. With this
observation, we report a Full-field Fourier Ptychography (FFP) scheme for rapid
and robust aberration metrology. The meaning of 'full-field' in FFP is referred
to the recovering of the 'full-field' coefficients that govern the
field-dependent pupil over the entire FOV. The optimization degrees of freedom
are at least two orders of magnitude lower than the previous implementations.
We show that the image acquisition process of FFP can be completed in ~1s and
the spatially varying aberration of the entire FOV can be recovered in ~35s
using a CPU. The reported approach may facilitate the further development of
Fourier ptychography. Since no moving part or calibration target is needed in
this approach, it may find important applications in aberration metrology. The
derivation of the full-field coefficients and its extension for Zernike modes
also provide a general tool for analyzing spatially varying aberrations in
computational imaging systems.

hash table taught in most textbooks, compact hashing is a less common technique
for saving space when hashing integers whose domain is relatively small with
respect to the problem size. It is widely believed that hash tables waste a
considerable amount of memory, as they either leave allocated space untouched
(open addressing) or store additional pointers (separate chaining). For the
former, Cleary introduced the compact hashing technique that stores only a part
of a key to save space. However, as can be seen by the line of research
focusing on compact hash tables with open addressing, there is additional
information, called displacement, required for restoring a key. There are
several representations of this displacement information with different space
and time trade-offs. In this article, we introduce a separate chaining hash
table that applies the compact hashing technique without the need for the
displacement information. Practical evaluations reveal that insertions in this
hash table are faster or use less space than all previously known compact hash
tables on modern computer architectures when storing sufficiently large

repulsive (fermionic) particle distributions. But their recent popularization
is largely due to their usefulness for encouraging diversity in the final stage
of a recommender system.
  The standard sampling scheme for finite DPPs is a spectral decomposition
followed by an equivalent of a randomly diagonally-pivoted Cholesky
factorization of an orthogonal projection, which is only applicable to
Hermitian kernels and has an expensive setup cost. Researchers have begun to
connect DPP sampling to $LDL^H$ factorizations as a means of avoiding the
initial spectral decomposition, but existing approaches have only outperformed
the spectral decomposition approach in special circumstances, where the number
of kept modes is a small percentage of the ground set size.
  This article proves that trivial modifications of $LU$ and $LDL^H$
factorizations yield efficient direct sampling schemes for non-Hermitian and
Hermitian DPP kernels, respectively. Further, it is experimentally shown that
even dynamically-scheduled, shared-memory parallelizations of high-performance
dense and sparse-direct factorizations can be trivially modified to yield DPP
sampling schemes with essentially identical performance.

methods in applied macroeconomic research. Like all nonparametric methods, the
HP filter depends critically on a tuning parameter that controls the degree of
smoothing. Yet in contrast to modern nonparametric methods and applied work
with these procedures, empirical practice with the HP filter almost universally
relies on standard settings for the tuning parameter that have been suggested
largely by experimentation with macroeconomic data and heuristic reasoning. As
recent research (Phillips and Jin, 2015) has shown, standard settings may not
be adequate in removing trends, particularly stochastic trends, in economic
data.
  This paper proposes an easy-to-implement practical procedure of iterating the
HP smoother that is intended to make the filter a smarter smoothing device for
trend estimation and trend elimination. We call this iterated HP technique the
boosted HP filter in view of its connection to $L_{2}$-boosting in machine
learning. The paper develops limit theory to show that the boosted HP (bHP)
filter asymptotically recovers trend mechanisms that involve unit root
processes, deterministic polynomial drifts, and polynomial drifts with
structural breaks. A stopping criterion is used to automate the iterative HP
algorithm, making it a data-determined method that is ready for modern
data-rich environments in economic research. The methodology is illustrated
using three real data examples that highlight the differences between simple HP
filtering, the data-determined boosted filter, and an alternative
autoregressive approach. These examples show that the bHP filter is helpful in
analyzing a large collection of heterogeneous macroeconomic time series that
manifest various degrees of persistence, trend behavior, and volatility.

fluid--structure--acoustics interactions involving large deformations and
complex geometries. In this method, the fluid dynamics is solved by a finite
difference method where the temporal, viscous and convective terms are
respectively discretized by the third-order Runge-Kutta scheme, the
fourth-order central difference scheme and a fifth-order W/TENO
(Weighted/Targeted Essentially Non-oscillation) scheme. Without loss of
generality, a nonlinear flexible plate is considered here, and is solved by a
finite element method based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The
no-slip boundary condition at the fluid--structure interface is achieved by
using a diffusion-interface penalty IB method. With the above proposed method,
the aeroacoustics field generated by the moving boundaries and the associated
flows are inherently solved. In order to validate and verify the current
method, several benchmark cases are conducted: acoustic waves scattered from a
stationary cylinder in a quiescent flow, sound generation by a stationary and a
rotating cylinder in a uniform flow, sound generation by an insect in hovering
flight, deformation of a red blood cell induced by acoustic waves and acoustic
waves scattered by a stationary sphere. The comparison of the sound scattered
by a cylinder shows that the present IB--WENO scheme, a simple approach, has an
excellent performance which is even better than the implicit IB--lattice
Boltzmann method. For the sound scattered by a sphere, the IB--TENO scheme has
a lower dissipation compared with the IB--WENO scheme. Applications of this
technique to model fluid-structure-acoustics interactions of flapping foils
mimicking an insect wing section during forward flight and flapping foil energy
harvester are also presented, considering the effects of foil shape and

snapping-induced curvature inversion of the initially bent ligaments results in
a pop-up process that first localizes near an imperfection and then, as the

selecting the geometry of the cuts and the curvature of the shell. Our study
significantly expands the ability of existing kirigami metamaterials and opens

become valid when the anisotropy is large, but in addition, the interaction

scalability to large datasets. To solve the lack of information of microtexts,
we allow our method to take advantage of word embeddings for additional

autoencoding variational Bayes, an algorithm that can perform efficient
black-box inference in probabilistic models. The result of our work is a novel
topic model called the nested variational autoencoder, which is a distribution

with subcarrier number modulation (OFDM-SNM) has been proposed and regarded as
one of the promising candidate modulation schemes for next generation networks.
Although OFDM-SNM is capable of having a higher spectral efficiency (SE) than
OFDM with index modulation (OFDM-IM) and plain OFDM under certain conditions,
its reliability is relatively inferior to these existing schemes, because the
number of active subcarriers varies. In this regard, we propose an enhanced
OFDM-SNM scheme in this paper, which utilizes the flexibility of placing
subcarriers to harvest a coding gain in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
region. In particular, we stipulate a methodology that optimizes the subcarrier
activation pattern (SAP) by subcarrier assignment using instantaneous channel
state information (CSI) and therefore the subcarriers with higher channel power
gains will be granted the priority to be activated, given the number of
subcarriers is fixed. We also analyze the proposed enhanced OFDM-SNM system in
terms of outage and error performance. The average outage probability and block
error rate (BLER) are derived and approximated in closed-form expressions,
which are further verified by numerical results generated by Monte Carlo
simulations. The high-reliability nature of the enhanced OFDM-SNM makes it a
promising candidate for implementing in the Internet of Things (IoT) with
stationary machine-type devices (MTDs), which are subject to slow fading and

coordination benefits. Specifically, we extend previous results on an
optimization-based modeling approach for electric AMoD systems to jointly
control an electric AMoD fleet and a series of PDNs, and analyze the benefit of
coordination under load balancing constraints. For a case study of Orange
County, CA, we show that the coordination between the electric AMoD fleet and
the PDNs eliminates 99% of the overloads and 50% of the voltage drops that the
electric AMoD fleet would cause in an uncoordinated setting. Our results show
that coordinating electric AMoD and PDNs can help maintain the reliability of
PDNs under added electric AMoD charging load, thus significantly mitigating or
deferring the need for PDN capacity upgrades.

a symmetry-protected BIC while the second one is a quasi-BIC induced by
vertical symmetry-breaking. The overlap of two BICs in the momentum space
engenders a large area of ultra-high quality factor around the $\Gamma$ point,

recovery from an eclipsing double-lined binary system. We focused on a syntetic
system composed by a primary of mass M = 0.95 Msun and a secondary of M = 0.85
Msun. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted at three metallicities, and three
evolutionary stages of the primary. For each configuration artificial data were
sampled assuming an increasing difference between the mixing-length of the two
stars. The mixing length values were reconstructed using three alternative
set-ups. A first method, which assumes full independence between the two stars,
showed a great difficulty to constrain the mixing-length values: the recovered
values were nearly unconstrained with a standard deviation of 0.40. The second
technique imposes the constraint of common age and initial chemical composition
for the two stars in the fit. We found that $\alpha_{ml,1}$ values match the
ones recovered under the previous configuration, but $\alpha_{ml,2}$ values are
peaked around unbiased estimates. This occurs because the primary star provides
a much more tight age constraint in the joint fit than the secondary. Within
this second scenario we also explored, for systems sharing a common
$\alpha_{ml}$, the difference in the mixing-length values of the two stars only
due to random fluctuations owing to the observational errors. The posterior
distribution of these differences was peaked around zero, with a large standard
deviation of 0.3 (15\% of the solar-scaled value). The third technique also
imposes the constraint of a common mixing-length value for the two stars, and
served as a test for identification of wrong fitting assumptions. In this case
the common mixing-length is mainly dictated by the value of $\alpha_{ml,2}$.
[...] For $\Delta \alpha_{ml} > 0.4$ less than half of the systems can be
recovered and only 20% at $\Delta \alpha_{ml} = 1.0$.

insight into the interplay between high-dimensional (or microscopic) chaotic

analysis to investigate whether chimera states in globally coupled
Stuart-Landau (SL) oscillators exhibit collective degrees of freedom. We
compare two types of chimera states, which emerge in SL ensembles with linear
and nonlinear global coupling, respectively, the latter introducing a
constraint that conserves the oscillation of the mean. Lyapunov spectra reveal
that for both chimera states the Lyapunov exponents split into different groups
with different convergence properties in the limit of large system size.
Furthermore, in both cases the Lyapunov dimension is found to scale extensively
and the localization properties of covariant Lypunov vectors manifest the
presence of collective Lyapunov modes. Here, however, we find qualitative
differences between the two types of chimera states: Whereas the ones in the
system under nonlinear global coupling exhibit only slow collective modes
corresponding to Lyapunov exponents equal or close to zero, those which
experience the linear mean-field coupling exhibit also faster collective modes
associated with Lyapunov exponents with large positive or negative values.

rectifying a previously reported issue. The Pantheon catalogue until very
recently had the redshifts of all SNe Ia up to z $\sim$ 0.3 modified under the
guise of 'peculiar velocity corrections' - although there is no information on
peculiar velocities at such high redshifts. While this has reportedly been
rectified on Github by removing peculiar velocity corrections for z > 0.08, the
impact of this on the published cosmological analysis of the Pantheon catalogue

bias the inferred value of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ towards higher values, while the
equivalent effect on Pantheon cannot be ascertained due to the unavailability

erupted but failed to be ejected to become a coronal mass ejection (CME), are
failed eruptions with the filament maximum height exceeding $100 Mm$. The
magnetic field of filament source regions is approximated by a potential field
extrapolation method. The filament 3D configuration is reconstructed from three
vantage points by the observations of STEREO Ahead/Behind and SDO spacecraft.
We calculate the decay index at the apex of these failed filaments and find
that in 7 cases, their apex decay indexes exceed the theoretical threshold
($n_{crit} = 1.5$) of the torus instability. We further determine the
orientation change or rotation angle of each filament top during the eruption.
Finally, the distribution of these events in the parameter space of rotation
angle versus decay index is established. Four distinct regimes in the parameter
space are empirically identified. We find that, all the torus-unstable cases
(decay index $n > 1.5$), have a large rotation angles ranging from $50^\circ -
130^\circ$. The possible mechanisms leading to the rotation and failed eruption
are discussed. These results imply that, besides the torus instability, the
rotation motion during the eruption may also play a significant role in solar

(anti-)de Sitter hyperboloid is cut along the null wave surface, and the
`halves' are then re-attached with a suitable shift of their null generators
across the wave surface. This special family of global null geodesics defines
an appropriate comoving coordinate system, leading to the continuous form of
the metric. Moreover, it provides a complete understanding of the nature of the
Penrose junction conditions and their specific form. These findings shed light

Traditionally, behavior planners instruct local motion planners with predefined
behaviors. Due to the high scene complexity in urban environments,
unpredictable situations may occur in which behavior planners fail to match
predefined behavior templates. Recently, general-purpose planners have been
introduced, combining behavior and local motion planning. These general-purpose
planners allow behavior-aware motion planning given a single reward function.
However, two challenges arise: First, this function has to map a complex
feature space into rewards. Second, the reward function has to be manually
tuned by an expert. Manually tuning this reward function becomes a tedious
task. In this paper, we propose an approach that relies on human driving
demonstrations to automatically tune reward functions. This study offers
important insights into the driving style optimization of general-purpose
planners with maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning. We evaluate our
approach based on the expected value difference between learned and
demonstrated policies. Furthermore, we compare the similarity of human driven
trajectories with optimal policies of our planner under learned and
expert-tuned reward functions. Our experiments show that we are able to learn
reward functions exceeding the level of manual expert tuning without prior
domain knowledge.

graphene boundaries, in quantitative agreement with theoretical calculations

large effective capacitance variation across the device channel with a
nontrivial, inhomogeneous profile due not only to classical electrostatics but
also to quantum mechanical effects. We show that such quantum capacitance
contribution, occurring due to the low density of states (DOS) across the

piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), are well adapted for
describing such situations. PDMPs approximate the jump Markov processes
traditionally used as models for stochastic chemical reaction networks.
Although hybrid modelling is now well established in biology, these models

a finite state, continuous time Markov process, whereas the mRNA and protein
levels follow ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The Monte-Carlo method
combines direct simulation of the PDMP with analytic solutions of the ODEs. The
push-forward method numerically computes the probability measure advected by
the deterministic ODE flow, through the use of analytic expressions of the
corresponding semigroup. Compared to earlier versions of this method, the
probability of the promoter states sequence is computed beyond the naive mean

  Millimeter Wave Networks","15 pages, Submitted to Elsevier Computer Networks",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a millimeter wave (mmWave) network, user association, the process of
deciding as to which base station (BS) a given user should associate with, is a
crucial process which affects the throughput and delay performance seen by
users in the network and the amount of load at each BS. In the existing
research literature, the stability region of a user association policy, i.e.,
the set of user arrival rates for which the user association policy stabilizes
the network, has not been analytically characterized for any user association
policy for mmWave networks. In this paper, we study the user association
problem in mmWave networks and compare the performance of four user association
policies: Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) based, Throughput based, Load based and
Mixed. All these policies are simple, easy to implement, distributed and
online. We use a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model and Lyapunov
function techniques to analytically characterize the stability region of each
of the above four user association policies. We also evaluate the performance
of the above four user association policies in a large mmWave network, in which
link qualities fluctuate with time and users are mobile, via detailed
simulations. Our results show that the Throughput based policy outperforms the
other three user association policies in terms of stability region as well as
average throughput, average delay and fairness performance.

application of the dynamic Chebyshev method of Glau et al. (2019). The dynamic
Chebyshev method delivers a closed form approximation of the option prices
along the paths together with the options' delta and gamma. Key advantage is
the polynomial structure of the approximation, which allows us a highly
efficient evaluation of the credit exposures, even for a large number of
simulated paths. The approach is highly flexible in the model choice, payoff
profiles and asset classes. We compute the exposure profiles for Bermudan and
barrier options in three different equity models and compare them to the
profiles of European options. The analysis reveals potential shortcomings of
common simplifications in the exposure calculation. The proposed method is
sufficiently simple and efficient to avoid such risk-bearing simplifications.

  appendices, 1 table, 4 figures)",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background. Non-inferiority (NI) trials are increasingly used to evaluate new
treatments expected to have secondary advantages over standard of care, but
similar efficacy on the primary outcome. When designing a NI trial with a
binary primary outcome, the choice of effect measure for the NI margin has an
important effect on sample size calculations; furthermore, if the control event
risk observed is markedly different from that assumed, the trial can quickly
lose power or the results become difficult to interpret. Methods. We propose a
new way of designing NI trials to overcome the issues raised by unexpected
control event risks by specifying a NI frontier, i.e. a curve defining the most
appropriate non-inferiority margin for each possible value of control event
risk. We propose a fixed arcsine difference frontier, the power-stabilising
transformation for binary outcomes. We propose and compare three ways of
designing a trial using this frontier. Results. Testing and reporting on the
arcsine scale leads to results which are challenging to interpret clinically.
Working on the arcsine scale generally requires a larger sample size compared
to the risk difference scale. Therefore, working on the risk difference scale,
modifying the margin after observing the control event risk, might be
preferable, as it requires a smaller sample size. However, this approach tends
to slightly inflate type I error rate; a solution is to use a lower
significance level for testing. When working on the risk ratio scale, the same
approach leads to power levels above the nominal one, maintaining type I error
under control. Conclusions. Our proposed methods of designing NI trials using
power-stabilising frontiers make trial design more resilient to unexpected
values of the control event risk, at the only cost of requiring larger sample
sizes when the goal is to report results on the risk difference scale.

vehicles, whose ever more stringent data traffic requirements might exceed the
capacity of traditional technologies for vehicular networks. In this scenario,
densely deploying millimeter wave (mmWave) base stations is a promising
approach to provide very high transmission speeds to the vehicles. However,
mmWave signals suffer from high path and penetration losses which might render
the communication unreliable and discontinuous. Coexistence between mmWave and
Long Term Evolution (LTE) communication systems has therefore been considered
to guarantee increased capacity and robustness through heterogeneous
networking. Following this rationale, we face the challenge of designing fair
and efficient attachment policies in heterogeneous vehicular networks.
Traditional methods based on received signal quality criteria lack
consideration of the vehicle's individual requirements and traffic demands, and
lead to suboptimal resource allocation across the network. In this paper we
propose a Quality-of-Service (QoS) aware attachment scheme which biases the
cell selection as a function of the vehicular service requirements, preventing
the overload of transmission links. Our simulations demonstrate that the
proposed strategy significantly improves the percentage of vehicles satisfying
application requirements and delivers efficient and fair association compared

years with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, industrial
communication network technology such as Profinet has proved to be a major game
changer for such automation. However, industrial automation devices often have
to exhibit robustness to dynamically changing network conditions and thus,
demand a rigorous testing environment to avoid any safety-critical failures.
Hence, in this paper, we have proposed an FPGA-based novel framework called
Profi-Load to generate Profinet traffic with specific intensities for a
specified duration of time. The proposed Profi-Load intends to facilitate the
performance testing of the industrial automated devices under various network
conditions. By using the advantage of inherent hardware parallelism and
re-configurable features of FPGA, Profi-Load is able to generate Profinet
traffic efficiently. Moreover, it can be reconfigured on the fly as per the
specific requirements. We have developed our proposed Profi-Load framework by
employing the Xilinx-based NetJury device which belongs to Zynq-7000 FPGA
family. A series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of Profi-Load and it has been observed that Profi-Load is able to
generate precise load at a constant rate for stringent timing requirements.
Furthermore, a suitable Human Machine Interface (HMI) has also been developed
for quick access to our framework. The HMI at the client side can directly
communicate with the NetJury device and parameters such as, required load
amount, number of packet(s) to be sent or desired time duration can be selected
using the HMI.

invariably considered either the nozzle initial conditions or the asymptotic
conditions far downstream, as scaling parameters for the streamwise variations
of length and velocity scales. These choices, however, do not square with the
notion of self similarity which is essentially a ""local"" concept. We first
demonstrate that the streamwise variations of velocity and length scales in
wall jets show remarkable scaling with local parameters i.e. there appear to be
no imposed length and velocity scales. Next, it is shown that the mean velocity
profile data suggest existence of two distinct layers - the wall (inner) layer
and the full-free jet (outer) layer. Each of these layers scales on the
appropriate length and velocity scales and this scaling is observed to be
universal i.e. independent of the local friction Reynolds number. Analysis
shows that the overlap of these universal scalings leads to a
Reynolds-number-dependent power-law velocity variation in the overlap layer. It
is observed that the mean-velocity overlap layer corresponds well to the
momentum-balance mesolayer and there appears to be no evidence for an inertial
overlap; only the meso-overlap is observed. Introduction of an intermediate
variable absorbs the Reynolds-number dependence of the length scale in the
overlap layer and this leads to a universal power-law overlap profile for mean
velocity in terms of the intermediate variable.

minimum. The cost function utilizes the error patterns of the local quantum
memories and the predictability of the evolution of the entanglement
fidelities. Our method provides efficient entanglement distributing with
respect to the actual statuses of the local quantum memories of the node pairs.
The model provides an easily-applicable, moderate-complexity solution for
high-fidelity entanglement distribution in experimental quantum Internet

high number of measurement rounds to determine a global optimal measurement

applying quantum operations and measurements with high-precision control in the
physical layer. These issues result in extremely high-cost measurements with a
low probability of success at the end of the measurement rounds. Here, we

linear-time estimation, which is considered a requisite for big data analysis
in machine learning, geostatistics, and related domains. Against this backdrop,
this study proposes a scalable GWR (ScaGWR) for large datasets. The key
improvement is the calibration of the model through a pre-compression of the
matrices and vectors whose size depends on the sample size, prior to the
leave-one-out cross-validation, which is the heaviest computational step in
conventional GWR. This pre-compression allows us to run the proposed GWR
extension so that its computation time increases linearly with the sample size.
With this improvement, the ScaGWR can be calibrated with one million
observations without parallelization. Moreover, the ScaGWR estimator can be
regarded as an empirical Bayesian estimator that is more stable than the
conventional GWR estimator. We compare the ScaGWR with the conventional GWR in
terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency using a Monte Carlo
simulation. Then, we apply these methods to a US income analysis. The code for
ScaGWR is available in the R package scgwr. The code is embedded into C++ code

localization, which is usually performed by estimating the direction of arrival
(DOA), learning-based methods have recently been developed. In this paper, it
is experimentally shown that the trained SED model is able to contribute to the
direction of arrival estimation (DOAE). However, joint training of SED and DOAE
degrades the performance of both. Based on these results, a two-stage
polyphonic sound event detection and localization method is proposed. The
method learns SED first, after which the learned feature layers are transferred
for DOAE. It then uses the SED ground truth as a mask to train DOAE. The
proposed method is evaluated on the DCASE 2019 Task 3 dataset, which contains
different overlapping sound events in different environments. Experimental
results show that the proposed method is able to improve the performance of
both SED and DOAE, and also performs significantly better than the baseline
method.

point. On the other hand, long-ranged correlations appear more commonly in
certain non-equilibrium systems with conservation laws. Consequently, a variety
of non-equilibrium fluctuation phenomena, including fluctuation-induced forces,
have been discovered and explored recently. Here, we address a long-standing
problem of non-equilibrium critical Casimir forces emerging after a quench to
the critical point in a confined fluid with order-parameter-conserving dynamics
and non-symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. The interplay of inherent
(critical) fluctuations and dynamical non-local effects (due to density
conservation) gives rise to striking features, including correlation functions
and forces exhibiting oscillatory time-dependences. Complex transient regimes
arise, depending on initial conditions and the geometry of the confinement. Our
findings pave the way for exploring a wealth of non-equilibrium processes in
critical fluids (e.g., fluctuation-mediated self-assembly or aggregation). In
certain regimes, our results are applicable to active matter.

Standard Model which aim to explain neutrino masses, like for instance in Type
I seesaw models, or one of its variants. If the scale of the new Heavy Neutral
Leptons (HNLs) is sufficiently low, observable signatures can arise in a range
of current and upcoming experiments, from the LHC to neutrino experiments. In
this article, we discuss the phenomenology of sterile neutrinos in the MeV to
GeV mass range, focusing on their decays. We embed our discussion in a
realistic mass model and consider the resulting implications. We focus in
particular on the impact on the signal of the strong polarisation effects in
the beam for Majorana and (pseudo-)Dirac states, providing formulae to
incorporate these in both production and decay. We study how the Near Detector
of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) can constrain HNL
states by searching for their decay products inside the detector. We conduct a
Monte Carlo background analysis for the most promising signatures,
incorporating the detector's particle identification capabilities, and estimate
the experimental sensitivity of DUNE to these particles. We also present an
estimate of the $\nu_\tau$-derived HNL flux at DUNE, currently missing in the
literature, which allows us to discuss searches for HNLs at higher masses.

image. Most existing methods for image-to-image translation can either perform
a fixed translation between any two image domains using a single attribute or
require training data with the attributes of interest for each subject.
Therefore, these methods could only train one specific model for each pair of
image domains, which limits their ability in dealing with more than two
domains. Another disadvantage of these methods is that they often suffer from
the common problem of mode collapse that degrades the quality of the generated
images. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose attribute guided face image
generation method using a single model, which is capable to synthesize multiple
photo-realistic face images conditioned on the attributes of interest. In
addition, we adopt the proposed model to increase the realism of the simulated
face images while preserving the face characteristics. Compared to existing
models, synthetic face images generated by our method present a good
photorealistic quality on several face datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that
generated facial images can be used for synthetic data augmentation, and
improve the performance of the classifier used for facial expression

demonstrate the emergence of a metallic layer at the interface between the two

transfer across the interface, which alters the valence state of the transition
metal cations close to the interface. Somewhat counter-intuitively, the charge
is transferred from the Ti cations with formal $d^1$ electron configuration to
the the V cations with formal $d^2$ configuration, thereby increasing the
occupation difference of the $t_{2g}$ states. This can be understood as a
result of a gradual transition of the charge transfer energy, or
electronegativity, across the interface. The spatial extension of the metallic
layer, in particular towards the LaTiO$_3$ side, can be controlled by epitaxial
strain, with tensile strain leading to a localization within a thickness of
only two unit cells. Our results open up a new route for creating a tunable
quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in materials with strong electronic

improve performance of cellular networks. However, co-channel interference
among cellular users (CUs) and D2D multicast groups (MGs) limits the gains of
such communication. Allowing the CUs to have exclusion zones around them where
no receiver of any MG can exist, is a realistic and pragmatic approach to
reduce the co-channel interference of cellular transmission on D2D multicast
reception. We use a stochastic geometry based approach to model this scenario.
Specifically, we model the locations of CUs and D2D MG receivers with
homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP), and Poisson Hole Process (PHP),
respectively. We formulate the network sum throughput maximization problem in
terms of a joint MG channel and power allocation problem with constraints on
cellular and MG users maximum transmit and acceptable quality of service. We
establish that the MG channel allocation problem has computational complexity

computationally efficient scheme that achieves almost optimal performance for

algorithm that achieves almost optimal performance for the subset channel

synthetic attacks into background traffic. The injected synthetic attacks blend
themselves with the background traffic by mimicking the background traffic's
properties to eliminate any trace of ID2T's usage.
  This work has three core contribution areas. First, we present a
comprehensive survey on intrusion detection datasets. In the survey, we propose
a classification to group the negative qualities we found in the datasets.
Second, the architecture of ID2T is revised, improved and expanded. The
architectural changes enable ID2T to inject recent and advanced attacks such as
the widespread EternalBlue exploit or botnet communication patterns. The
toolkit's new functionality provides a set of tests, known as TIDED (Testing

we study the NP-hard decision questions of whether for a constant q an input
graph has a q-ONCF-coloring or a q-CNCF-coloring. We will study these two
problems in the parameterized setting.
  First of all, we study running time bounds on FPT-algorithms for these
problems, when parameterized by treewidth. We improve the existing upper
bounds, and also provide lower bounds on the running time under ETH and SETH.
  Secondly, we study the kernelization complexity of both problems, using
vertex cover as the parameter. We show that both $(q \geq 2)$-ONCF-coloring and
$(q \geq 3)$-CNCF-coloring cannot have polynomial kernels when parameterized by
the size of a vertex cover unless $NP \in coNP/poly$. However, we obtain a
polynomial kernel for 2-CNCF-coloring parameterized by vertex cover.
  We conclude with some combinatorial results. Denote $\chi_{ON}(G)$ and
$\chi_{CN}(G)$ to be the minimum number of colors required to ONCF-color and
CNCF-color G, respectively. Upper bounds on $\chi_{CN}(G)$ with respect to
structural parameters like minimum vertex cover size, minimum feedback vertex

literature that can successfully represent, generate or translate 3D facial

publicly available 3D face databases are scarce as well as limited in terms of
sample size and variability (e.g., few subjects, little diversity in race and
gender), and (b) mesh convolutions for deep networks present several challenges
that are not entirely tackled in the literature, leading to operator
approximations and model instability, often failing to preserve high-frequency
components of the distribution. As a result, linear methods such as Principal

despite being unable to capture non-linearities and high frequency details of
the 3D face - such as eyelid and lip variations. In this work, we present

frequency is tuned with field to pass through the phonon, the phonon become
circularly polarized as shown by a notable splitting in their response to
right- and left-hand polarized light. This splitting can be expressed as an
effective phonon magnetic moment that is approximately 2.7 times the Bohr

This exceedingly large value is due to the coupling of the phonons to the

new functionality for nonlinear optics to create light-induced topological
phases in Dirac semimetals.

output feedback controller that achieves simultaneous stabilization, desired
decoupling, robustness, and performance for a finite set of unstable

RSSD output feedback controller, a new method that is based on a central plant
is proposed in this paper. Given a finite set of plants for simultaneous

controller using the properties of the eigenstructure assignment method.
  Afterward, the sufficient conditions for the existence of a RSSD output

optimization problem for the synthesis of a RSSD output feedback controller is
formulated. To solve this optimization problem, a new genetic algorithm based
offline iterative algorithm is developed. The effectiveness of this iterative
algorithm is then demonstrated by generating a RSSD controller for a fixed-wing

from the data mining community because they are inherently easier to understand
and explain than their more complex counterparts. Examples of interpretable
classification models include decision trees, rule sets, and rule lists.
Learning such models often involves optimizing hyperparameters, which typically
requires substantial amounts of data and may result in relatively large models.
In this paper, we consider the problem of learning compact yet accurate
probabilistic rule lists for multiclass classification. Specifically, we
propose a novel formalization based on probabilistic rule lists and the minimum
description length (MDL) principle. This results in virtually parameter-free
model selection that naturally allows to trade-off model complexity with
goodness of fit, by which overfitting and the need for hyperparameter tuning
are effectively avoided. Finally, we introduce the Classy algorithm, which
greedily finds rule lists according to the proposed criterion. We empirically
demonstrate that Classy selects small probabilistic rule lists that outperform
state-of-the-art classifiers when it comes to the combination of predictive
performance and interpretability. We show that Classy is insensitive to its
only parameter, i.e., the candidate set, and that compression on the training

theory. We investigate this question in the case of quorum sensing (QS)
bacteria, which regulate cooperative traits in response to population density.
Cooperation is modeled by the prisoner's dilemma, where individuals produce a
costly public good (PG) that equally benefits all members of a community
divided into multiple, distinct patches (multilevel selection). Cost and
benefit are non-linear functions of the PG production. The analysis of
evolutionary stability yields an optimization problem for the expression of PG
in dependency on the number of QS individuals within a colony. We find that the
optimal total PG production of the QS population mainly depends on the shape of
the benefit. A graded and a switch-like response is possible, in accordance
with earlier results. Interestingly, at the level of the individual cell, the
QS response is determined by the shape of the costs. All QS individuals respond
either homogeneously if cost are a convex function of the PG production rate,
or they respond heterogeneously with distinct ON/OFF responses if the costs are
concave. The latter finding is consistent with recent experimental findings,
and contradicts the usual interpretation of QS as a mechanism to establish a
uniform, synchronized response of a bacterial population.

post-starburst galaxies, indicating burst-like star-formation histories (SFH)
in the primordial Universe. We have investigated the role of high energy cosmic
rays (CRs) in such environments, particularly how they could contribute to this
burst-like SFH via quenching and feedback. These high energy particles interact
with the baryon and radiation fields of their host via hadronic processes to
produce secondary leptons. The secondary particles then also interact with
ambient radiation fields to generate X-rays through inverse-Compton scattering.
In addition, they can thermalise directly with the semi-ionised medium via
Coulomb processes. Heating at a rate of $\sim 10^{-25} \;
\text{erg}~\text{cm}^{-3}~\text{s}^{-1}$ can be attained by Coulomb processes
in a star-forming galaxy with one core-collapse SN event per decade, and this
is sufficient to cause quenching of star-formation. At high-redshift, a
substantial amount of CR secondary electron energy can be diverted into
inverse-Compton X-ray emission. This yields an X-ray luminosity of above
$10^{41}~\text{erg}~\text{s}^{-1}$ by redshift $z=7$ which drives a further
heating effect, operating over larger scales. This would be able to halt
inflowing cold gas filaments, strangulating subsequent star-formation. We
selected a sample of 16 starburst and post-starburst galaxies at $7\lesssim z
\lesssim 9$ and determine the star-formation rates they could have sustained.
We applied a model with CR injection, propagation and heating to calculate
energy deposition rates in these 16 sources. Our calculations show that CR
feedback cannot be neglected as it has the strength to suppress star-formation
in these systems. We also show that their currently observed quiescence is
consistent with the suffocation of cold inflows, probably by a combination of
X-ray and CR heating.

differentiate to become blue, white or red. The goal is for the cells to color
the grid as a French flag, i.e., a three-colored triband, in a distributed
manner. To solve a generalized version of the problem in a distributed
computational setting, we consider two models: a biologically-inspired version
that relies on morphogens (diffusing proteins acting as chemical signals) and a
more abstract version based on reliable message passing between cellular
agents.
  Much of developmental biology research has focused on concentration-based
approaches using morphogens, since morphogen gradients are thought to be an
underlying mechanism in tissue patterning. We show that both our model types
easily achieve a French ribbon - a French flag in the 1D case. However,
extending the ribbon to the 2D flag in the concentration model is somewhat
difficult unless each agent has additional positional information. Assuming
that cells are are identical, it is impossible to achieve a French flag or even
a close approximation. In contrast, using a message-based approach in the 2D
case only requires assuming that agents can be represented as constant size
state machines.
  We hope that our insights may lay some groundwork for what kind of message
passing abstractions or guarantees, if any, may be useful in analogy to cells
communicating at long and short distances to solve patterning problems. In
addition, we hope that our models and findings may be of interest in the design
of nano-robots.

Moreover, their high toxicity (due to the presence of lead in the perovskite
crystalline structure) makes it necessary that the thickness of the absorber
layers to be further reduced, for their future commercialization, without
reducing the device performance. Here we aim to address these issues via
embedding spherical plasmonic nanoparticles of various sizes, composition,

halide-based perovskite solar cells architecture, and to clarify their effect
on the absorption properties and enhancement. We theoretically show that
plasmon-enhanced near-field effects and scattering leads to a device
photocurrent enhancement of up to ~7.3% when silver spheres are embedded inside
the perovskite layer. Interestingly, the combination of silver spheres in
perovskite and aluminum spheres inside the hole transporting layer (PEDOT:PSS)
of the solar cell leads to an even further enhancement, of up to ~12%. This
approach allows the employment of much thinner perovskite layers in PSCs (up to
150 nm) to reach the same photocurrent as the nanoparticles-free device and
reducing thus significantly the toxicity of the device. Providing the
requirements related to the size, shape, position, composition, and

characterized by a double-\Lambda atom-light coupling scheme. A pair of
resonant spatially dependent control fields prepare atoms in a
position-dependent coherent population trapping state, while a pair of much
weaker vortex probe beams propagate in the coherently driven atomic medium.
Using the adiabatic approximation we derive the propagation equations for the
probe beams. We consider a situation where the second control field is absent
at the entrance to the atomic cloud and the first control field goes to zero at
the end of the atomic medium. In that case the incident vortex probe beam can
transfer its OAM to a generated probe beam. We show that the efficiency of such
an energy conversion approaches the unity under the adiabatic condition. On the
other hand, by using spatially independent profiles of the control fields, the
maximum conversion efficiency is only 1/2.

We perform a study of Benford's law from the application of the Laplace

Benford's law for distributions which oscillate violently in the inverse

applications of VB in discrete choice analysis have been limited to mixed logit

may vary both between individuals as well as across choice tasks encountered by

scalable and accurate alternative to MSL and MCMC estimation, especially in
applications in which fast predictions are paramount. VB is observed to be
between 2.8 and 17.7 times faster than the two competing methods, while
affording comparable or superior accuracy. Besides, the simulation study
demonstrates that a parallelised implementation of the MSL estimator with
analytical gradients is a viable alternative to MCMC in terms of both
estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, as the MSL estimator is
observed to be between 0.9 and 2.1 times faster than MCMC.

encourage convergence to the endemic, mixed equilibria. On the contrary, if

major differences from the related properties of quantum systems. Two search
algorithms utilizing the observed features are introduced. For the first one we
assume an unsorted names database set up by Alice that is a superposition
(unknown by Bob) of up to n=2^N strings; those we call names. Bob has access to
the superposition wave and to the 2N reference noises of the INBL system of N
noise bits. For Bob, to decide if a given name x is included in the
superposition, once the search has begun, it takes N switching operations
followed by a single measurement of the superposition wave. Thus the time and
hardware complexity of the search algorithm is O[log(n)] which indicates an
exponential speedup compared to Grover's quantum algorithm in a corresponding
setting. An extra advantage is that the error probability of the search is
zero. Moreover, the scheme can also check the existence of a fraction of a
string, or several separate string fractions embedded in an arbitrarily long,
arbitrary string. In the second algorithm, we expand the above scheme to a
phonebook with n names and s phone numbers. When the names and numbers have the
same bit resolution, once the search has begun, the time and hardware
complexity of this search algorithm is O[log(n)]. In the case of one-to-one

inverse phonebook search too. The error probability of this search algorithm is

portfolios and allocate assets. In order to attain certain desired return
profiles, quantitative strategists must determine a large array of trading
parameters. Backtesting, the attempt to identify the appropriate parameters
using historical data available, has been highly criticized due to the
abundance of misleading results. Hence, there is an increasing interest in
devising procedures for the assessment and comparison of strategies, that is,
devising schemes for preventing what is known as backtesting overfitting. So
far, many financial researchers have proposed different ways to tackle this
problem that can be broadly categorised in three types: Data Snooping,
Overestimated Performance, and Cross-Validation Evaluation. In this paper, we
propose a new approach to dealing with financial overfitting, a
Covariance-Penalty Correction, in which a risk metric is lowered given the
number of parameters and data used to underpins a trading strategy. We outlined
the foundation and main results behind the Covariance-Penalty correction for
trading strategies. After that, we pursue an empirical investigation, comparing
its performance with some other approaches in the realm of Covariance-Penalties
across more than 1300 assets, using Ordinary and Total Least Squares. Our
results suggest that Covariance-Penalties are a suitable procedure to avoid
Backtesting Overfitting, and Total Least Squares provides superior performance
when compared to Ordinary Least Squares.

  remotely sensed data",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many studies have recently explored the information from the
satellite-remotely sensed data (SRSD) for estimating the crop production
statistics. The value of this information depends on the aerial and spatial
resolutions of SRSD. The SRSD with fine spatial resolution is costly and the
aerial coverage is less. Use of multiple frames of SRSD in the estimation
process of crop production can increase the precision. We propose an estimator
for the average yield of wheat for the state of Haryana, India. This estimator
uses the information from the Wide Field Sensor (WiFS) and the Linear Imaging
Self Scanner (LISS-III) data from the Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS-1D)
and the crop cutting experiment data collected by probability sampling design
from a list frame of villages. We find that the relative efficiencies of the
multiple-frame estimators are high in comparison to the single frame
estimators.

Various adversarial attacks are designed to evaluate the robustness of models
and develop defense model. Currently, adversarial attacks are brought up to
attack their own target model with their own evaluation metrics. And most of
the black-box adversarial attack algorithms cannot achieve the expected success
rate compared with white-box attacks. In this paper, comprehensive evaluation
metrics are brought up for different adversarial attack methods. A novel
perturbation optimized black-box adversarial attack based on genetic algorithm
(POBA-GA) is proposed for achieving white-box comparable attack performances.
Approximate optimal adversarial examples are evolved through evolutionary
operations including initialization, selection, crossover and mutation. Fitness
function is specifically designed to evaluate the example individual in both
aspects of attack ability and perturbation control. Population diversity
strategy is brought up in evolutionary process to promise the approximate
optimal perturbations obtained. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to
testify POBA-GA's performances. Both simulation and application results prove
that our method is better than current state-of-art black-box attack methods in
aspects of attack capability and perturbation control.
