general relativity can manifest in upcoming galaxy surveys. This is especially
relevant for theories exhibiting Vainshtein screening, where such deviations
are efficiently suppressed within a (typically large) Vainshtein radius.
However, Vainshtein screening is known to be shape dependent: it is most
effective around spherical sources, weaker around cylindrical objects and
completely absent for planar sources. The Cosmic Web therefore offers a testing
ground, as it displays many shapes in the form of clusters, filaments and
walls.
  In this work, we explicitly derive the signature of the shape dependence of
Vainshtein screening on the matter bispectrum, by considering a cubic Galileon
model with a conformal coupling to matter and a cosmological constant. We
perform a second order perturbative analysis, deriving analytic, integral
expressions for the bispectrum, which we integrate using hi_class. We find that
the shape dependence of Vainshtein screening enters the bispectrum with a
unique scale-factor dependence of $\propto a^{3/2}$. The magnitude of the
effect today is up to 2 % for a model whose linear growth rate deviates up to 5
% from $\Lambda$CDM.

  Score Matching",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Probabilistic graphical models provide a flexible yet parsimonious framework
for modeling dependencies among nodes in networks. There is a vast literature
on parameter estimation and consistent model selection for graphical models.
However, in many of the applications, scientists are also interested in
quantifying the uncertainty associated with the estimated parameters and
selected models, which current literature has not addressed thoroughly. In this
paper, we propose a novel estimator for statistical inference on edge
parameters in pairwise graphical models based on generalized Hyv\""arinen
scoring rule. Hyv\""arinen scoring rule is especially useful in cases where the
normalizing constant cannot be obtained efficiently in a closed form, which is
a common problem for graphical models, including Ising models and truncated
Gaussian graphical models. Our estimator allows us to perform statistical
inference for general graphical models whereas the existing works mostly focus
on statistical inference for Gaussian graphical models where finding
normalizing constant is computationally tractable. Under mild conditions that
are typically assumed in the literature for consistent estimation, we prove
that our proposed estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal,
which allows us to construct confidence intervals and build hypothesis tests
for edge parameters. Moreover, we show how our proposed method can be applied
to test hypotheses that involve a large number of model parameters
simultaneously. We illustrate validity of our estimator through extensive
simulation studies on a diverse collection of data-generating processes.

these methods do not produce any further information about the type of threat

malware samples. In this work, we address the information gap between machine
learning and signature-based detection methods by learning a representation
space for malware samples in which files with similar malicious behaviors
appear close to each other. We do so by introducing a deep learning based
tagging model trained to generate human-interpretable semantic descriptions of
malicious software, which, at the same time provides potentially more useful
and flexible information than malware family names.
  We show that the malware descriptions generated with the proposed approach
correctly identify more than 95% of eleven possible tag descriptions for a
given sample, at a deployable false positive rate of 1% per tag. Furthermore,
we use the learned representation space to introduce a similarity index between
malware files, and empirically demonstrate using dynamic traces from files'
execution, that is not only more effective at identifying samples from the same
families, but also 32 times smaller than those based on raw feature vectors.

drawback of EFDR is that it requires the data to be defined on regular pixels

possibly incomplete data defined on irregular small areas. Motivated by
statistical learning, we use conditional simulation (CS) to condition on the
available data and simulate the full rectangular image at its finest resolution

Averaging over these estimates yields a single, combined estimate of a possible

present. We test the original null hypothesis of no signal by combining the M
p-values into a single p-value using copulas and a composite likelihood. If the

(SdNLW) with the cubic nonlinearity, forced by a space-time white noise. In
particular, we investigate the limiting behavior of solutions to SdNLW with
regularized noises and establish triviality results in the spirit of the work
by Hairer, Ryser, and Weber (2012). More precisely, without renormalization of
the nonlinearity, we establish the following two limiting behaviors; (i) in the
strong noise regime, we show that solutions to SdNLW with regularized noises
tend to 0 as the regularization is removed and (ii) in the weak noise regime,
we show that solutions to SdNLW with regularized noises converge to a solution
to a deterministic damped nonlinear wave equation with an additional mass term.

long-wavelength oscillators using partial wave guiding through ultraviolet
through hard x-ray FELs that are either seeded or start from noise (SASE).
Operation in the x-ray spectrum has relied on single-pass SASE due either to
the lack of seed lasers or difficulties in the design of x-ray mirrors.
However, recent developments in the production of diamond crystal Bragg
reflectors point the way to the design of regenerative amplifiers (RAFELs)
which are, essentially, low-Q x-ray free-electron laser oscillators (XFELOs)
that out-couple a large fraction of the optical power on each pass. A RAFEL
using a six-mirror resonator providing out-coupling of 90% or more through a
pinhole in the first downstream mirror is proposed and analyzed using the
MINERVA simulation code for the undulator interaction and the Optics
Propagation Code (OPC) for the resonator. MINERVA/OPC has been used in the past
to simulate infrared FEL oscillators. For the present purpose, OPC has been
modified to treat Bragg reflection from diamond crystal mirrors. The six-mirror
resonator design has been analyzed within the context of the LCLS-II beamline
under construction at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and using the HXR
undulator which is also to be installed on the LCLS-II beamline. Simulations
have been run to optimize and characterize the properties of the RAFEL, and
indicate that substantial powers are possible at the fundamental (3.05 keV) and
third harmonic (9.15 keV).

  Workshop on Trusted Smart Contracts",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The wide deployment of tokens for digital assets on top of Ethereum implies
the need for powerful trading platforms. Vickrey auctions have been known to
determine the real market price of items as bidders are motivated to submit
their own monetary valuations without leaking their information to the
competitors. Recent constructions have utilized various cryptographic protocols
such as ZKP and MPC, however, these approaches either are partially
privacy-preserving or require complex computations with several rounds. In this
paper, we overcome these limits by presenting Trustee as a Vickrey auction on
Ethereum which fully preserves bids' privacy at relatively much lower fees.
Trustee consists of three components: a front-end smart contract deployed on
Ethereum, an Intel SGX enclave, and a relay to redirect messages between them.
Initially, the enclave generates an Ethereum account and ECDH key-pair.
Subsequently, the relay publishes the account's address and ECDH public key on
the smart contract. As a prerequisite, bidders are encouraged to verify the
authenticity and security of Trustee by using the SGX remote attestation
service. To participate in the auction, bidders utilize the ECDH public key to
encrypt their bids and submit them to the smart contract. Once the bidding
interval is closed, the relay retrieves the encrypted bids and feeds them to
the enclave that autonomously generates a signed transaction indicating the
auction winner. Finally, the relay submits the transaction to the smart
contract which verifies the transaction's authenticity and the parameters'
consistency before accepting the claimed auction winner. As part of our
contributions, we have made a prototype for Trustee available on Github for the
community to review and inspect it. Additionally, we analyze the security
features of Trustee and report on the transactions' gas cost incurred on
Trustee smart contract.

products along fibrations with cofibrant domains preserve fibrations, establish
the weak equivalence extension property for weak equivalences between
fibrations with cofibrant domain and define a univalent classifying fibration
for small fibrations between bifibrant objects. These results allow us to
define a comprehension category supporting identity types, $\Sigma$-types,
$\Pi$-types and a univalent universe, leaving only a coherence question to be

magnetization plateaus and ferroelectricity, but its magnetic ground state
remains ambiguous due to its structural complexity. Magnetometry measurements,
and time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction (NPD) have been employed to study
the structural and magnetic properties of Co2V2O7, which consists of two
non-equivalent Co sites. Upon cooling below the Ne\'el temperature TN = 6.3 K,
we observe magnetic Bragg peaks at 2K in NPD which indicated the formation of
long range magnetic order of Co2+ moments. After symmetry analysis and magnetic
structure refinement, we demonstrate that Co2V2O7 possesses a complicated
non-collinear magnetic ground state with Co moments mainly located in b-c plane
and forming a non-collinear spin-chain-like structure along the c-axis. The ab
initio calculations demonstrate that the non-collinear magnetic structure is
more stable than various ferromagnetic states at low temperature. The
non-collinear magnetic structure with canted up-up-down-down spin configuration
is considered as the origin of magnetoelectric coupling in Co2V2O7 because the
inequivalent exchange striction induced by the spin-exchange interaction
between the neighboring spins is the driving force of ferroelectricity.
Besides, it is found that the deviation of lattice parameters a and b is
opposite below TN, while the lattice parameter c and stay almost constant below
TN, evidencing the anisotropic magnetoelastic coupling in Co2V2O7.

$k$-space we produce a set of simulations to bring out the effects of a
modulating function $f_{\rm mod} (k)=f_1 (k) + f_2 (k)$ on power spectra of
radial (shell-like) distributions of cosmological objects, where a model
function $f_1 (k)$ reproduces the smoothed power spectrum of underlying 3D
density fluctuations, while $f_2 (k)$ is a wiggling function imitating the
baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). It is shown that some excess of
realizations of simulated radial distributions actually displays
quasi-periodical components with periods about a characteristic scale $2\pi/k
\sim 100~h^{-1}$~Mpc detected as power-spectrum peaks in vicinity of the first
maximum of the modulation function $f_2 (k)$. We revised our previous
estimations of the significance of such peaks and found that they were largely
overestimated. Thereby quasi-periodical components appearing in some radial
distributions of matter are likely to be stochastic (rather than
determinative), while the amplitudes of the respective spectral peaks can be
quite noticeable. They are partly enhanced by smooth part of the modulating
function $f_1(k)$ and, to a far lesser extent, by effects of the BAO (i.e.
$f_2(k)$). The results of the simulations match quite well with statistical
properties of the radial distributions of the brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs).

steer a physical system to a steady state that solves a predefined, possibly

separation and give prescriptions that can be directly used in the design of

analysis, we derive stability bounds for different feedback laws that are based
on common continuous-time optimization schemes. In particular, we consider
gradient descent and its variations, including projected gradient, and Newton
gradient. We further give stability bounds for momentum methods and
saddle-point flows. Finally, we discuss how optimization algorithms like
subgradient and accelerated gradient descent, while well-behaved in offline

V \to \{0,1,2\}$ such that for every vertex $f(v) = 0$, it holds that $\sum_{u
\in N(v)} f(u) = 2$, i.e., the weight of the labels assigned by $f$ to the
neighbors of $v$ is exactly two. The weight of a perfect Italian function is
the sum of the weights of the vertices. The perfect Italian domination number
of $G$, denoted by $\gamma^p_I(G)$, is the minimum weight of any perfect
Italian dominating function of $G$. While introducing the parameter, Haynes and
Henning (Discrete Appl. Math. (2019), 164--177) also proposed the problem of
determining the best possible constants $c_\mathcal{G}$ such that
$\gamma^p_I(G) \leq c_\mathcal{G} \times n$ for all graphs of order $n$ when
$G$ is in a particular class $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs. They proved that
$c_\mathcal{G} = 1$ when $\mathcal{G}$ is the class of bipartite graphs, and
raised the question for planar graphs and regular graphs. We settle their
question precisely for planar graphs by proving that $c_\mathcal{G} = 1$ and
for cubic graphs by proving that $c_\mathcal{G} = 2/3$. For split graphs, we
also show that $c_\mathcal{G} = 1$. In addition, we characterize the graphs $G$

both to appreciate past conceptualization and naming for these aspects and

its classical counterpart.
  The case is made that each piecemeal aspect of Background Independence can be
incorporated, i.e. each piecemeal facet of the Problem of Time is resolvable,
in a local classical sense, using just Lie's Mathematics. This case is then
extended in Articles V to XIII to a joint resolution, i.e. successfully
handling the lion's share of the Problem of Time that resides in facet
interferences. Relationalism, Closure, Observables and Constructions are argued
to be super-aspects ordered to form a claw alias 3-star digraph with Closure as
nexus. This is realized twice: faithfully for spacetime and with some
modification in the split-Relationalism canonical case. There is finally a

that, in general, there is a gauge correction to the amplitude of the

spatially-flat gauge, while the number of e-folds is used as the time variable
(hence one works in the uniform-$N$ gauge) in the Langevin equations. We show
that these corrections vanish in the slow-roll limit, but we also explain how

ultra-slow roll and the Starobinsky model that interpolates between slow roll

fundamental processes of cell cycle, circadian rhythms and developmental

been increasingly used to test fundamental principles of genetic network
dynamics. A recently developed fast, tunable genetic oscillator by Stricker et
al.[23] has demonstrated robustness and tunability of oscillatory behavior by
combining positive and negative feedback loops. This oscillator combining lacI
(negative) and araC (positive) feedback loops, was however modeled using
multiple layers of differential equations to capture the molecular complexity
of regulation, in order to explain the experimentally measured oscillations. We
have developed a reduced model based on delay differential equations (DDEs) of
this dual feedback loop oscillator, that reproduces the tunability of
oscillator period and amplitude based on the concentration of the two inducers
isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and arabinose. Previous work had
predicted a need for an asymmetry in copy numbers of activator (araC) and
repressor (lacI) genes encoded on plasmids. We use our reduced model to
redesign the network by comparing the effect of asymmetry in gene expression at
the level of (a) DNA copy numbers and the rates of (b) mRNA translation and (c)
degradation. We find the minimal period of the oscillator is sensitive to DNA
copy number asymmetry, but translation rate asymmetry has an identical effect
as plasmid copy numbers, while modulating the asymmetry in mRNA degradation can
improve the tunability of period of the oscillator, together with increased
robustness to replication 'noise' and influence of the host cell cycle. Thus,
our model predicts experimentally testable principles to redesign a potentially
more robust oscillatory genetic network.

models of several well known fracton phases: two copies of the X-Cube model,
two copies of Haah's cubic code, and the checkerboard model. Where the former
two models possess an on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2$ layer exchange symmetry, that of

  Rubber","6 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When a thermoset polymer is cured at elevated temperature in a closed mold,
thermal expansion can produce flaws in the finished product. Those flaws occur
when rising internal pressure pushes the mold open and cured polymer flows out
through gaps at the parting lines. Known as backrind, such defects are
particularly common in compression molding, where the increasing pressure of a
trapped, incompressible polymer can overwhelm the clamping pressure on the mold
and expel polymer from the mold pocket. If that ejected material has already
cured, it leaves behind structural damage and consequently a flaw in the
finished product.
  Backrind usually appears as a ragged seam line near the gap where cured
polymer exited the mold. Its appearance is typically irregular and fragmented,
suggesting no particular pattern or uniformity to the process that produced it.
In such cases, the cured polymer acts predominantly as a viscoelastic solid as
it is driven toward and through the parting line. The backrind's ragged
character results from tearing and fragmentation of that solid.
  It is possible, however, for the cured polymer to act predominantly as a
viscoelastic liquid as it flows toward and through the parting line. Since the
Reynolds number is low, the flow is laminar and the backrind bears witness to
that laminar flow. More specifically, the backrind's observed shaped
corresponds to isochronous contours in the laminar flow toward the parting
line, contours that can be predicted using computational fluid dynamics.

solutions using gauge functions and integration constants, and show explicitly
how Fronsdal fields and their Weyl tensors arise from these data in accordance
with Vasiliev's central on mass shell theorem. We then gauge transform the
linearized piece of exact solutions, obtained in a convenient gauge in Weyl
order, to the aforementioned class, where we land in normal order. We spell out
this map for massless particle and higher spin black hole modes. Our results
show that Vasiliev's equations admit the correct free-field limit for master
field configurations that relax the original regularity and gauge conditions in
twistor space. Moreover, they support the off-shell Frobenius--Chern--Simons
formulation of higher spin gravity for which Weyl order plays a crucial role.
Finally, we propose a Fefferman-Graham-like scheme for computing asymptotically
anti-de Sitter master field configurations, based on the assumption that gauge
function and integration constant can be adjusted perturbatively so that the
full master fields approach free master fields asymptotically.

for the current frame. To create refocusable video, we extend recent machine
learning methods designed for still photography, contributing a new dataset for

AI-assist modules such as motion, face, audio and saliency detection. We also

hallmark of a massive cosmic structure. However, it is less well understood how
different types of galaxies trace the underlying large-scale structure.
Motivated by the discovery of a z=3.13 protocluster, we examine how the same
structure is populated by Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs). To this end, we
have undertaken a deep narrow-band imaging survey sampling Ly$\alpha$ emission
at this redshift. Of the 93 LAE candidates within a 36'x36'~(70x70~Mpc^2)
field, 21 galaxies form a significant surface overdensity (delta_g=3.3+/-0.9),
which is spatially segregated from the Lyman break galaxy (LBG) overdensity.
One possible interpretation is that they trace two separate structures of
comparable masses (~ 10^{15}M_sun) where the latter is hosted by a halo
assembled at an earlier time. We speculate that the dearth of LAEs in the LBG
overdensity region may signal the role of halo assembly bias in galaxy
formation, which would suggest that different search techniques may be biased
accordingly to the formation age or dynamical state of the host halo. The
median Ly$\alpha$- and UV luminosity is 30--70\% higher for the protocluster
LAEs relative to the field. This difference cannot be explained by the galaxy
overdensity alone, and may require a top-heavy mass function, higher star
formation efficiency for protocluster halos, or suppression of galaxy formation
in low-mass halos. A luminous Ly$\alpha$ blob and an ultramassive galaxy found
in this region paint a picture consistent with the expected early growth of
galaxies in clusters.

electron-electron interaction that originates from the Coulomb fields of the
electrons. This relativistic component, which has been commonly assumed small
in the low-energy approximation, appears large and very significant in
materials with the strong SOI. The PSOI, being determined by the spins and
momenta of electrons, has highly unusual properties among which of most
interest is the mutual attraction of the electrons in certain spin
configurations. We review the nature of the PSOI in solids and its
manifestations in low-dimensional systems that have been studied to date. The
specific results depend on the configuration of the Coulomb fields in a
particular structure. The main actual structures are considered:
one-dimensional quantum wires and two-dimensional layers, both suspended and
placed in various dielectric media, as well as in the presence of a metallic
gate. We discuss the possible types of the two-electron bound states, the
conditions of their formation, their spectra together with the spin and orbital
structure. In a many-particle system, the PSOI breaks the spin-charge
separation as a result of which spin and charge degrees of freedom are mixed in
the collective excitations. At sufficiently strong PSOI, one of the collective
modes softens. This signals of the instability, which eventually leads to the
reconstruction of the homogeneous state of the system.

density filaments and guided by modern theories of compressible
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. The interstellar turbulence shapes the
observed density structures. As the fundamental dynamics of compressible MHD
turbulence, perpendicular turbulent mixing of density fluctuations entails
elongated density structures aligned with the local magnetic field, accounting
for low-density parallel filaments seen in diffuse atomic and molecular gas.
The elongation of low-density parallel filaments depends on the turbulence
anisotropy. When taking into account the partial ionization, we find that the
minimum width of parallel filaments in the cold neutral medium and molecular
clouds is determined by the neutral-ion decoupling scale perpendicular to
magnetic field. In highly supersonic MHD turbulence in molecular clouds, both
low-density parallel filaments due to anisotropic turbulent mixing and
high-density filaments due to shock compression exist.

the IR limit of gravitational theories. Related to finiteness of fine tunings,
we conjecture that except for a finite number of CFTs, the rest cannot be
consistently coupled to gravity and belong to the swampland. Moreover, we argue
that even though matter sectors coupled to gravity may sometimes be partially
sequestered, there is an irreducible level of mixing between them, correlating

is a fascinating new direction of research. In the quantum realm, the many-body
localization (MBL) was proposed to be the paradigmatic ergodicity breaking
phenomenon, which extends the concept of Anderson localization to interacting
systems. At the same time, random matrix theory has established a powerful
framework for characterizing the onset of quantum chaos and ergodicity (or the
absence thereof) in quantum many-body systems. Here we numerically study the
spectral statistics of disordered interacting spin chains, which represent
prototype models expected to exhibit MBL. We study the ergodicity indicator
$g=\log_{10}(t_{\rm H}/t_{\rm Th})$, which is defined through the ratio of two
characteristic many-body time scales, the Thouless time $t_{\rm Th}$ and the
Heisenberg time $t_{\rm H}$, and hence resembles the logarithm of the
dimensionless conductance introduced in the context of Anderson localization.
We argue that the ergodicity breaking transition in interacting spin chains
occurs when both time scales are of the same order, $t_{\rm Th} \approx t_{\rm
H}$, and $g$ becomes a system-size independent constant. Hence, the ergodicity
breaking transition in many-body systems carries certain analogies with the
Anderson localization transition. Intriguingly, using a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless correlation length we observe a scaling
solution of $g$ across the transition, which allows for detection of the
crossing point in finite systems. We discuss the observation that scaled
results in finite systems by increasing the system size exhibit a flow towards
the quantum chaotic regime.

PNe in our galaxy and beyond, but it is a challenge to disambiguate partially
or fully unresolved PNe from the myriad other sources observed in these
surveys. Here we carry out synthetic observations of nebular models to
determine $ugrizy$ color-color spaces that can successfully identify PNe among
billions of other sources. As a primary result we present a grid of synthetic
absolute magnitudes for PNe at various stages of their evolution, and we make
comparisons with real PNe colors from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find
that the $r-i$ versus $g-r$, and the $r-i$ versus $u-g$, color-color diagrams
show the greatest promise for cleanly separating PNe from stars, background

equations are the constraint equations for general relativity on a
three-dimensional null hypersurface. The underlying boundary action consists of
two copies of the dressed Chern-Simons term for self-dual Ashtekar variables, a
kinetic term for the null flag at the boundary plus additional junction
conditions for the spin coefficients across the interface. In fact, there is a
doubling of the field content, because the null hypersurface will be considered
as an internal boundary between two adjacent slabs of spacetime. The paper
concludes with a proposal for a construction of the gravitational transition
amplitudes in the bulk via the auxiliary boundary field theory alone, namely by
gluing amplitudes for edge states across two-dimensional corners, thus
providing a proposal for a quasi-local realisation of the holographic principle
at the light front.

Initial ranking is based on image descriptors extracted from convolutional
neural network activations by global pooling, as in recent state-of-the-art
work. However, the same sparse 3D activation tensor is also approximated by a
collection of local features. These local features are then robustly matched to
approximate the optimal alignment of the tensors. This happens without any
network modification, additional layers or training. No local feature detection
happens on the original image. No local feature descriptors and no visual

  We experimentally show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art

different global pooling methods. The highest gain in performance is achieved
when diffusion on the nearest-neighbor graph of global descriptors is initiated

systems-level responses. Here, we present a framework centered on measuring
changes in the free energy of the system to link individual mutations in an
allosteric transcriptional repressor to the parameters which govern its
response. We find the energetic effects of the mutations can be categorized
into several classes which have characteristic curves as a function of the
inducer concentration. We experimentally test these diagnostic predictions
using the well-characterized LacI repressor of Escherichia coli, probing
several mutations in the DNA binding and inducer binding domains. We find that
the change in gene expression due to a point mutation can be captured by
modifying only a subset of the model parameters that describe the respective
domain of the wild-type protein. These parameters appear to be insulated, with
mutations in the DNA binding domain altering only the DNA affinity and those in
the inducer binding domain altering only the allosteric parameters. Changing
these subsets of parameters tunes the free energy of the system in a way that
is concordant with theoretical expectations. Finally, we show that the
induction profiles and resulting free energies associated with pairwise double
mutants can be predicted with quantitative accuracy given knowledge of the

There is evidence for a decrement in the CO (1$-$0) surface brightness at the

luminosities are comparable to those of unobscured AGN and dusty star-forming

suggesting that the targets are less efficient at forming stars. Therefore,
they may belong to the AGN feedback phase predicted by galaxy formation models,
because they are not efficiently forming stars considering their large amount

considering the (GPU) memory limits. Current approaches either downsample an

processing. In either way, the loss of local fine details or global contextual
information results in limited segmentation accuracy. We propose collaborative
Global-Local Networks (GLNet) to effectively preserve both global and local
information in a highly memory-efficient manner. GLNet is composed of a global
branch and a local branch, taking the downsampled entire image and its cropped
local patches as respective inputs. For segmentation, GLNet deeply fuses
feature maps from two branches, capturing both the high-resolution fine
structures from zoomed-in local patches and the contextual dependency from the
downsampled input. To further resolve the potential class imbalance problem
between background and foreground regions, we present a coarse-to-fine variant
of GLNet, also being memory-efficient. Extensive experiments and analyses have
been performed on three real-world ultra-high aerial and medical image datasets
(resolution up to 30 million pixels). With only one single 1080Ti GPU and less
than 2GB memory used, our GLNet yields high-quality segmentation results and
achieves much more competitive accuracy-memory usage trade-offs compared to

Progressive ER has only been examined in the context of structured (relational)

not require schema information, thus applying to heterogeneous data sources of

everyday life. Among them, Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have seen an outburst
of attention recently, specifically in the area with a demand for autonomy. A
key challenge standing in the way of making MAVs autonomous is that researchers
lack the comprehensive understanding of how performance, power, and
computational bottlenecks affect MAV applications. MAVs must operate under a
stringent power budget, which severely limits their flight endurance time. As
such, there is a need for new tools, benchmarks, and methodologies to foster
the systematic development of autonomous MAVs. In this paper, we introduce the
`MAVBench' framework which consists of a closed-loop simulator and an
end-to-end application benchmark suite. A closed-loop simulation platform is
needed to probe and understand the intra-system (application data flow) and
inter-system (system and environment) interactions in MAV applications to
pinpoint bottlenecks and identify opportunities for hardware and software
co-design and optimization. In addition to the simulator, MAVBench provides a
benchmark suite, the first of its kind, consisting of a variety of MAV
applications designed to enable computer architects to perform characterization
and develop future aerial computing systems. Using our open source, end-to-end
experimental platform, we uncover a hidden, and thus far unexpected compute to
total system energy relationship in MAVs. Furthermore, we explore the role of
compute by presenting three case studies targeting performance, energy and
reliability. These studies confirm that an efficient system design can improve
MAV's battery consumption by up to 1.8X.

and finite element models. The Bayesian statistical framework is adopted to
treat all the uncertainties present in the data, the mathematical model and its
finite element discretisation. From the outset, we postulate a data-generating
model which additively decomposes data into a finite element, a model
misspecification and a noise component. Each of the components may be uncertain
and is considered as a random variable with a respective prior probability
density. The prior of the finite element component is given by a conventional
stochastic forward problem. The prior probabilities of the model
misspecification and measurement noise, without loss of generality, are assumed
to have zero-mean and known covariance structure. Our proposed statistical
model is hierarchical in the sense that each of the three random components may
depend on non-observable random hyperparameters. Because of the hierarchical
structure of the statistical model, Bayes rule is applied on three different
levels in turn to infer the posterior densities of the three random components
and hyperparameters. On level one, we determine the posterior densities of the
finite element component and the true system response using the prior finite
element density given by the forward problem and the data likelihood. On the
next level, we infer the hyperparameter posterior densities from their
respective priors and the marginal likelihood of the first inference problem.
Finally, on level three we use Bayes rule to choose the most suitable finite
element model in light of the observed data by computing the model posteriors.

Aiming to complement the existing physical detection mechanisms, we propose a
machine learning-based framework for fast UAV identification over encrypted

Wi-Fi links for control and video streaming. The proposed framework extracts
features derived only from packet size and inter-arrival time of encrypted
Wi-Fi traffic, and can efficiently detect UAVs and identify their operation
modes. In order to reduce the online identification time, our framework adopts
a re-weighted $\ell_1$-norm regularization, which considers the number of
samples and computation cost of different features. This framework jointly
optimizes feature selection and prediction performance in a unified objective
function. To tackle the packet inter-arrival time uncertainty when optimizing
the trade-off between the detection accuracy and delay, we utilize Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method to estimate the packet inter-arrival time.

For
finite ionization rates, the laser pulse energy is partitioned into a pair of
counter-propagating waves and static transverse currents. The wave amplitudes
are determined by the ionization rates and the input pulse duration. The
strongest output waves can be obtained when the plasma is fully ionized in a
time that is shorter than the pulse duration. The static transverse current can
induce a static magnetic field with instant ionization, but it dissipates as
heat if the ionization time is longer than a few laser periods. This picture
comports with experimental data, providing a description of both laser
frequency upconverters as well as other laser-plasma interaction with evolving
plasma densities.

possible to conduct a randomized control trial. In settings where only
observational data is available, Synthetic Control (SC) methods provide a
popular data-driven approach to estimate a ""synthetic"" control by combining
measurements of ""similar"" units (donors). Recently, Robust SC (RSC) was
proposed as a generalization of SC to overcome the challenges of missing data
high levels of noise, while removing the reliance on domain knowledge for
selecting donors. However, SC, RSC, and their variants, suffer from poor
estimation when the pre-intervention period is too short. As the main
contribution, we propose a generalization of unidimensional RSC to
multi-dimensional RSC, mRSC. Our proposed mechanism incorporates multiple
metrics to estimate a synthetic control, thus overcoming the challenge of poor
inference from limited pre-intervention data. We show that the mRSC algorithm
with $K$ metrics leads to a consistent estimator of the synthetic control for
the target unit under any metric. Our finite-sample analysis suggests that the
prediction error decays to zero at a rate faster than the RSC algorithm by a
factor of $K$ and $\sqrt{K}$ for the training and testing periods (pre- and
post-intervention), respectively. Additionally, we provide a diagnostic test
that evaluates the utility of including additional metrics. Moreover, we
introduce a mechanism to validate the performance of mRSC: time series
prediction. That is, we propose a method to predict the future evolution of a
time series based on limited data when the notion of time is relative and not
absolute, i.e., we have access to a donor pool that has undergone the desired
future evolution. Finally, we conduct experimentation to establish the efficacy
of mRSC on synthetic data and two real-world case studies (retail and Cricket).

structure of naturally occurring tasks. There is considerable interest in
designing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with similar properties. This
includes proposals to learn the learning algorithm itself, an idea also known
as meta learning. One formal interpretation of this idea is as a partially
observable multi-task RL problem in which task information is hidden from the
agent. Such unknown task problems can be reduced to Markov decision processes
(MDPs) by augmenting an agent's observations with an estimate of the belief
about the task based on past experience. However estimating the belief state is
intractable in most partially-observed MDPs. We propose a method that
separately learns the policy and the task belief by taking advantage of various
kinds of privileged information. Our approach can be very effective at solving
standard meta-RL environments, as well as a complex continuous control
environment with sparse rewards and requiring long-term memory.

high-ionization UV emission lines present our best probe to detect and
characterize the most distant galaxies that we will observe in the coming

physics governing their production is poorly understood. Here we present recent
high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope spectra of two nearby extreme UV

escape from these galaxies may provide a secondary source of ionization that is
currently unconstrained observationally. Simultaneous radiative transfer models

analysis due to its low computational cost and noise robustness. This has drawn
for its successful application in many fields. Some of these include damage
detection, disease forecasting, and financial volatility analysis. However, to
successfully use PE, an accurate selection of two parameters is needed: the
permutation dimension $n$ and embedding delay $\tau$. These parameters are
often suggested by experts based on a heuristic or by a trial and error
approach. unfortunately, both of these methods can be time-consuming and lead
to inaccurate results. To help combat this issue, in this paper we investigate
multiple schemes for automatically selecting these parameters with only the
corresponding time series as the input. Specifically, we develop a
frequency-domain approach based on the least median of squares and the Fourier
spectrum, as well as extend two existing methods: Permutation Auto-Mutual
Information (PAMI) and Multi-scale Permutation Entropy (MPE) for determining
$\tau$. We then compare our methods as well as current methods in the
literature for obtaining both $\tau$ and $n$ against expert-suggested values in
published works. We show that the success of any method in automatically
generating the correct PE parameters depends on the category of the studied
system. Specifically, for the delay parameter $\tau$, we show that our
frequency approach provides accurate suggestions for periodic systems,
nonlinear difference equations, and ECG/EEG data, while the mutual information
function computed using adaptive partitions provides the most accurate results
for chaotic differential equations. For the permutation dimension $n$, both
False Nearest Neighbors and MPE provide accurate values for $n$ for most of the
systems with $n = 5$ being suitable in most cases.

minimally disturb the system. Seminal quantum optics experiments have achieved
such quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements of systems with few degrees of

many-body observable, the Hamiltonian of an interacting many-body system, can
be implemented in a trapped-ion analog quantum simulator. Through a single-shot
measurement, the many-body system is prepared in a narrow band of (highly
excited) energy eigenstates, and potentially even a single eigenstate. Our QND
scheme, which can be carried over to other platforms of quantum simulation,
provides a framework to investigate experimentally fundamental aspects of
equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics including the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis and quantum fluctuation relations.

hindering applications. However, while cracking has been widely studied for
bulk gels and packings of non-shrinkable grains, little is known about how
packings of shrinkable grains crack. Here, we elucidate how grain shrinkage
alters cracking during drying. Using experiments with model shrinkable hydrogel
beads, we show that differential shrinkage can dramatically alter crack
evolution during drying---in some cases, even causing cracks to spontaneously
""self-close"". In other cases, packings shrink without cracking or crack
irreversibly. We developed both granular and continuum models to quantify the
interplay between grain shrinkage, poromechanics, packing size, drying rate,
capillarity, and substrate friction on cracking. Guided by the theory, we also
found that cracking can be completely altered by varying the spatial profile of
drying. Our work elucidates the rich physics underlying cracking in shrinkable,
granular packings, and yields new strategies for controlling crack evolution.

lensing surveys. At each of these nodes we evolve a pair of $N$-body
simulations in which the sampling variance is highly suppressed, and ray-trace
the volumes 800 times to further increase the effective sky coverage. We
extract a lensing covariance matrix from these pseudo-independent light-cones

ensemble of 800 truly independent $N$-body runs. More precisely, a Fisher
analysis reveals that both methods yield marginalized two-dimensional

exactly once; if a hypergraph admits such a walk, then it is called eulerian.
Although this notion is one of the progenitors of graph theory --- dating back
to the eighteenth century --- treatment of this subject has only begun on
hypergraphs in the last decade. Other authors have produced results about
rank-2 universal cycles and 1-overlap cycles, which are equivalent to our
definition of Euler tours. In contrast, an Euler family is a collection of
nontrivial closed walks that jointly traverse every edge of the hypergraph
exactly once and cannot be concatenated simply. Since an Euler tour is an Euler
family comprising a single walk, having an Euler family is a weaker attribute
than being eulerian; we call a hypergraph quasi-eulerian if it admits an Euler
family. A triple system is a 3-uniform hypergraph in which every pair of
vertices lie in exactly $\lambda$ edges together, for some parameter $\lambda$.
We first prove that all triple systems with at least two edges are eulerian. We
then define a new kind of hypergraph, which we call $\ell$-covering
$k$-hypergraphs: these are $k$-uniform hypergraphs in which every $\ell$-subset
of the vertices lie in at least one edge together. We are able to show that
such hypergraphs are eulerian when $\ell=k-1$ and quasi-eulerian otherwise, as
long as they have at least two edges. Finally, we give some constructive
results on hypergraphs with small edge cuts. There has been analogous work by
other authors on hypergraphs with small vertex cuts. We reduce the problem of
finding an Euler tour in a hypergraph to finding an Euler tour in each of the
connected components of the edge-deleted subhypergraph, then show how these
individual Euler tours can be concatenated.

PCAC, the observed deviations from the operator identity cast doubt on whether
all the systematics in the extraction of form factors from the correlation
functions are under control. We identify the problematic systematic as a missed
excited state, whose energy as a function of the momentum transfer squared,
$Q^2$, is determined from the analysis of the 3-point functions themselves. Its
mass is much smaller than those of the excited states previously considered and
including it impacts the extraction of all the ground state matrix elements.
The form factors extracted using these mass/energy gaps satisfy PCAC and other
consistency conditions, and validate the pion-pole dominance hypothesis. We
also show that the extraction of the axial charge $g_A$ is very sensitive to
the value of the mass gaps of the excited states used and current lattice data
do not provide an unambiguous determination of these, unlike the $Q^2 \neq 0$

forward time. Indeed, flows, semiflows, and maps (both invertible and not) have
been studied at length. A view that has proven particularly fruitful is
topological: consider invariant sets (attractors, repellers, periodic orbits,
etc.) as topological objects, and the connecting sets between them form
gradient like flows. In the case of systems with uniqueness in forward time, an
attractor in one system is related to nearby attractors in a family of other,
""close enough"" systems.
  One way of seeing that connection is through the Conley decomposition (and
the Conley index) [2], [13]. This approach requires focusing on isolated
invariant sets - that is, invariant sets with isolating neighborhoods. If there
is an invariant set $I$, which has an isolating neighborhood $N$ $\ldots$.
  This approach was expanded to discrete time systems which lack uniqueness in
forward time, using relations, in [7] and [11]. Relations do not rely on
uniqueness in forward time, but the graph of any map is a relation; thus they
serve to generalize maps. Some of this is reviewed in the next few sections. In
addition, I expanded on work done in [7] to show that in compact metric spaces,
attractors for closed relations continue (see Section 6). On the continuous
time side, more work needs to be done. This paper is a step toward a more
systematic approach for continuous time systems which lack uniqueness in
forward time. This work applies to Filippov systems [4] and in control theory
[12]. In the following pages, we establish a tool (multiflows) for discussing
the continuous time case and develop a framework for understanding attractors
(and therefore stability) in these systems. A crucial part of this work was
establishing attractor / attracting neighborhood pairs, which happens in

  Hemodynamics using Neural Network Regression","Submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",,,,"eess.IV cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) is a quantitative, non-invasive
alternative to perfusion imaging with contrast agents. Fixing values of certain
model parameters in traditional ASL, which actually vary from region to region,
may introduce bias in perfusion estimates. Adopting Magnetic Resonance
Fingerprinting (MRF) for ASL is an alternative where these parameters are
estimated alongside perfusion, but multiparametric estimation can degrade
precision. We aim to improve the sensitivity of ASL-MRF signals to underlying
parameters to counter this problem, and provide precise estimates. We also
propose a regression based estimation framework for MRF-ASL.
  Methods: To improve the sensitivity of MRF-ASL signals to underlying
parameters, we optimize ASL labeling durations using the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB). This paper also proposes a neural network regression based estimation
framework trained using noisy synthetic signals generated from our ASL signal
model.
  Results: We test our methods in silico and in vivo, and compare with multiple
post labeling delay (multi-PLD) ASL and unoptimized MRF-ASL. We present
comparisons of estimated maps for six parameters accounted for in our signal
model.
  Conclusions: The scan design process facilitates precise estimates of
multiple hemodynamic parameters and tissue properties from a single scan, in
regions of gray and white matter, as well as regions with anomalous perfusion
activity in the brain. The regression based estimation approach provides
perfusion estimates rapidly, and bypasses problems with quantization error.

terahertz frequency ranges consists of three patterned metallic layers
separated by dielectrics. Such metasurfaces are well suited to planar
fabrication techniques and their synthesis is facilitated by modelling them as
impedance sheets separated by transmission lines. We show that this model can
be significantly inaccurate in some cases, due to near-field coupling between
metallic layers. This problem is particularly severe for higher frequency
designs, where fabrication tolerances prevent the patterns from being
highly-subwavelength in size. Since the near-field coupling is difficult to
describe analytically, correcting for it in a design typically requires
numerical optimization. We propose an extension of the widely used
equivalent-circuit model to incorporate near-field coupling and show that the
extended model can predict the scattering parameters of a metasurface
accurately. Based on our extended model, we introduce an improved metasurface
synthesis algorithm that gives physical insight to the problem and efficiently
compensates for the perturbations induced by near-field coupling. Using the
proposed algorithm, a Huygens metasurface for beam refraction is synthesized
showing a performance close to the theoretical efficiency limit despite the
presence of strong near-field coupling.

traffic oscillations in the congested regime of the linearized two-class
Aw-Rascle (AR) traffic model. The macroscopic second-order two-class AR traffic
model consists of four hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs)
describing the dynamics of densities and velocities on freeway. The concept of
area occupancy is used to express the traffic pressure and equilibrium speed
relationship yielding a coupling between the two classes of vehicles. Each
vehicle class is characterized by its own vehicle size and driver's behavior.
The considered equilibrium profiles of the model represent evenly distributed
traffic with constant densities and velocities of both classes along the
investigated track section. After linearizing the model equations around those
equilibrium profiles, it is observed that in the congested traffic one of the
four characteristic speeds is negative, whereas the remaining three are
positive. Backstepping control design is employed to stabilize the $4 \times 4$
heterodirectional hyperbolic PDEs. The control input actuates the traffic flow
at outlet of the investigated track section and is realized by a ramp metering.
A full-state feedback is designed to achieve finite time convergence of the
density and velocity perturbations to the equilibrium at zero. This result is
then combined with an anti-collocated observer design in order to construct an
output feedback control law that damps out stop-and-go waves in finite time by
measuring the velocities and densities of both vehicle classes at the inlet of
the investigated track section. The performance of the developed controllers is
verified by simulation.

Here we report the first experimental observation of the dynamical bulk-surface
correspondence through measuring the topological charges in a 2D quantum
anomalous Hall model realized in an optical Raman lattice. The system can be
quenched with respect to every spin axis by suddenly varying the two-photon
detuning or phases of the Raman couplings, in which the topological charges and
BISs are measured dynamically by the time-averaged spin textures. We observe
that the total charges in the region enclosed by BISs define a dynamical
topological invariant, which equals the Chern index of the post-quench band.
The topological charges relate to an emergent dynamical field which exhibits
nontrivial topology on BIS, rendering the dynamical bulk-surface
correspondence. This study opens a new avenue to explore topological phases

a novel model is proposed, and, under this model, a novel grant-based scheme is

transmit small coordination indices in order to perform the scheduling request,
which allows both the request from the users to be efficient and the feedback
to be small. We also present improvements to the Ordentlich and Polyanskiy's
scheme, allowing it to transmit information through the choice of sub-block, as
well as to handle collisions of the same message, significantly improving the
method for very small messages. Simulation results show that, if a small
feedback is allowed, the proposed scheme performs closely to the state-of-art

introduce several new ideas, which enable us not only to deal with non-linear

the PB happens when we drive the system from one side but the photon-induced
tunneling happens when we drive the system from the other side. However, there
is no such phenomenon in the second-harmonic mode. Remarkably, the PB

problem, in which we are given a universe $U$, a collection $S$ of subsets of

partitioned into $k$ sets in $S$. This is a natural extension of the
well-studied SetCover problem; though in the parameterized regime we know it to
be $W[1]$-complete in the exact case, its parameterized complexity with respect
to approximability is not well understood.
  We prove that, assuming ETH, for some $\gamma > 0$ there is no time $f(k)
\cdot N^{\gamma k}$ algorithm that can, given a $k$-ExactCover instance $I$,
distinguish between the case where $I$ has an exact cover of size $k$ and the
case where every set cover of $I$ has size at least $\frac14
\sqrt[k]{\frac{\log N}{\log \log N}}$. This rules out even more than FPT
algorithms, and additionally rules out any algorithm whose approximation ratio
depends only on the parameter $k$. By assuming SETH, we instead improve the
lower bound to requiring time $f(k) \cdot N^{k - \varepsilon}$, for any
$\varepsilon > 0$.
  In this work we also extend the inapproximability result to the

$A \in \mathbb{F}_2^{m \times n}$, a vector $y \in \mathbb{F}_2^m$, and the

there exists a codeword with distance at most $k$ from $y$ and the case where
every codeword has distance at least $\frac18 \sqrt[k]{\frac{\log N}{\log \log

by carefully designing a novel Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN).
Specifically, regarding the 3D Morphable face Model (3DMM) parameters of the
same individual as the same class, we employ the contrastive loss to enlarge
the inter-class distance and meanwhile reduce the intra-class distance for the
output 3DMM parameters. We also propose an identity loss to preserve the
identity information for the same individual in the feature space. Training
with these two losses, our SCNN could learn representations that are more
discriminative for face identity and generalizable for pose variants.
Experiments on the challenging database 300W-LP and AFLW2000-3D have shown the
effectiveness of our method by comparing with state-of-the-arts.

an identity involving $\delta$ and a sum of divisor function $\sigma'$. The
first-named author and Raji in \cite{Guerzhoy} discussed a natural
generalization of the identity by introducing a quadratic character $\chi$
modulo a prime $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. In particular, it turns out that, besides
the original case $p=3$ considered by Farkas, an exact analog (in a certain
precise sense) of Farkas' identity happens only for $p=7$. Recently, for
quadratic characters of small composite moduli, Williams in \cite{Williams}
found a finite list of identities of similar flavor using different methods.
  Clearly, if $p \not \equiv 3 \pmod 4$, the character $\chi$ is either not
quadratic or even. In this paper, we prove that, under certain conditions, no
analogs of Farkas' identity exist for even characters. Assuming $\chi$ to be
odd quartic, we produce something surprisingly similar to the results from
\cite{Guerzhoy}: exact analogs of Farkas' identity happen exactly for $p=5$ and
$13$.

the details and sequences of these strokes, and also the sizes of the spheres.
We define the efficiency of the swimmer using Lighthill's criterion, i.e., the

show that the variations of efficiency with size ratio is not monotonic and
there exists a specific size ratio at which the swimmer has the highest

neural networks across a set of relevant but diverse datasets. Compared to
learning a separate network from each dataset in isolation, joint learning
enables us to extract correlated information across multiple datasets to
significantly improve the quality of learned networks. We formulate this
problem as joint learning of multiple copies of the same network architecture
and enforce the network weights to be shared across these networks. Instead of
hand-encoding the shared network layers, we solve an optimization problem to
automatically determine how layers should be shared between each pair of
datasets. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines
without joint learning and those using pretraining-and-fine-tuning. We show the
effectiveness of our approach on three tasks: image classification, learning
auto-encoders, and image generation.

data-inefficiency and limited generalization. Recent efforts apply
meta-learning to learn a meta-learner from a set of RL tasks such that a novel
but related task could be solved quickly. Though specific in some ways,
different tasks in meta-RL are generally similar at a high level. However, most
meta-RL methods do not explicitly and adequately model the specific and shared
information among different tasks, which limits their ability to learn training
tasks and to generalize to novel tasks. In this paper, we propose to capture
the shared information on the one hand and meta-learn how to quickly abstract
the specific information about a task on the other hand. Methodologically, we
train an SGD meta-learner to quickly optimize a task encoder for each task,
which generates a task embedding based on past experience. Meanwhile, we learn
a policy which is shared across all tasks and conditioned on task embeddings.
Empirical results on four simulated tasks demonstrate that our method has
better learning capacity on both training and novel tasks and attains up to 3
to 4 times higher returns compared to baselines.

learning techniques that can help reduce the time and effort consumed by manual
interpretation workflows. However, most successful supervised machine learning
algorithms require huge amounts of annotated training data. Obtaining these
labels for large seismic volumes is a very time-consuming and laborious task.
We address this problem by presenting a weakly-supervised approach for
predicting the labels of various seismic structures. By having an interpreter
select a very small number of exemplar images for every class of subsurface
structures, we use a novel similarity-based retrieval technique to extract
thousands of images that contain similar subsurface structures from the seismic
volume. By assuming that similar images belong to the same class, we obtain
thousands of image-level labels for these images; we validate this assumption
in our results section. We then introduce a novel weakly-supervised algorithm
for mapping these rough image-level labels into more accurate pixel-level
labels that localize the different subsurface structures within the image. This
approach dramatically simplifies the process of obtaining labeled data for
training supervised machine learning algorithms on seismic interpretation
tasks. Using our method we generate thousands of automatically-labeled images
from the Netherlands Offshore F3 block with reasonably accurate pixel-level
labels. We believe this work will allow for more advances in machine
learning-enabled seismic interpretation.

show that given this likely upper limit in the radii of purely-rocky

adiabatic temperature is relatively moderate, 630 GPa and 5000 K, while the

that for planets with radii less than 1.5 Earth radii, core-mantle boundary

insensitive to planet structure. The pressures and temperatures of rocky
exoplanet interiors, then, are less than those explored in recent
shock-compression experiments, ab-initio calculations, and planetary dynamical

does not introduce significant uncertainties in the structural models of these

uncertainty in the equation of state, even when extrapolated to TPa pressures.

preprocessing, regression of mathematical model using training data, model

to find food depended on their hunger motivation. However, the time it took a
plasmodium to start looking for food depended on its motivation and the
motivation of its competitor. Plasmodia always initiated foraging quicker if
they were in the presence of a competitor and the quickest if they were hungry
and in the presence of a satiated competitor. The time it took to arrive to the
food was not influenced by whether they were alone or with a competitor.
Ultimately, this complex competition response benefited the hungry plasmodia as

resolution images, aging, illumination and pose variance, etc. One of the most
important problem is low resolution face images which can result in bad
performance on face recognition. Most of the general face recognition
algorithms usually assume a sufficient resolution for the face images. However,
in practice many applications often do not have sufficient image resolutions.
The modern face hallucination models demonstrate reasonable performance to
reconstruct high-resolution images from its corresponding low resolution
images. However, they do not consider identity level information during
hallucination which directly affects results of the recognition of low
resolution faces. To address this issue, we propose a Face Hallucination
Generative Adversarial Network (FH-GAN) which improves the quality of low
resolution face images and accurately recognize those low quality images.
Concretely, we make the following contributions: 1) we propose FH-GAN network,
an end-to-end system, that improves both face hallucination and face
recognition simultaneously. The novelty of this proposed network depends on
incorporating identity information in a GAN-based face hallucination algorithm
via combining a face recognition network for identity preserving. 2) We also
propose a new face hallucination network, namely Dense Sparse Network (DSNet),
which improves upon the state-of-art in face hallucination. 3) We demonstrate
benefits of training the face recognition and GAN-based DSNet jointly by
reporting good result on face hallucination and recognition.

prominent and varying broad-absorption lines (BALs) with blueshifted velocity
up to $\rm \sim 14000\ km\ s^{-1}$. The observed significant MIR variability,
the UV to optical color variabilities in the Swift bands that deviate from the
predictions of pure dust attenuation models, and the fact that Swift light
curves can be well fitted by the stochastic AGN variability model suggest that
its observed flux variabilities in UV-optical-MIR bands should be intrinsic,
rather than owing to variable dust extinction. Furthermore, the variations of
BAL features (i.e., trough strength and maximum velocity) and continuum
luminosity are concordant. Therefore, we propose that the BAL variability
observed in WPVS 007 is likely induced by the intrinsic ionizing continuum
variation, alternative to the rotating-torus model proposed in a previous work.
The BAL gas in WPVS 007 might be in the low-ionization state as traced by its
weak N V BAL feature; as the ionizing continuum strengthens, the Ci IV and Si
IV column densities also increase, resulting in stronger BALs and the emergence
of high-velocity components of the outflow. The outflow launch radius might be
as small as $\sim 8 \times 10^{-4}$ pc under the assumption of being
radiatively driven, but a large-scale origin (e.g., torus) cannot be fully
excluded because of the unknown effects from additional factors, e.g., the

for living systems. It has been suggested, for instance, that nonlinear pulses
such as action potentials (APs) can only exist if the membrane state is in
vicinity of a TD transition. Herein, two membrane properties - excitability and
AP velocity - are investigated for a broad spectrum of conditions in living
systems (temperature (T), 3D-pressure (p) and pH dependence). Based on these
data we predict parameter ranges in which a transition of the membrane is
located (15-35{\deg}C below growth temperature; 1-3 pH units below pH 7; at
~800 atm) and propose the corresponding phase diagrams. The latter explain: (i)
changes of AP velocity with T, p and pH. (ii) The existence and origin of two
qualitatively different forms of loss of nonlinear excitability (""nerve

trigger APs. Finally, a quantitative comparison between the TD behaviour of
2D-lipid model membranes with living systems is attempted. The typical shifts
in transition temperature with pH and p of model membranes agree closely with
values obtained from cell physiological measurements (excitability and
propagation velocity). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that it
is not specific molecules that control the excitability of living systems but
rather the TD properties of the quasi 2D-membrane interface. The approach as
proposed herein can be extended to other quantities (surface potential, calcium
concentration, etc.) and makes clearly falsifiable predictions, for example,
that a transition exists within the specified parameter ranges in excitable
cells.

thus factored. Although the approach is not general-purpose, it does admit
interesting programs. The effectful DSL is likewise rather problem-specific and
lacks general-purpose monadic composition, or even functions. On the upside, it
expresses the problem elegantly, is simple to implement and reason about, and
lends itself to non-standard interpretations such as code generation
(compilation) and abstract interpretation. A specialized DSL is liable to be
frequently extended; the experience with the tagless-final style of DSL
embedding shown that the DSL evolution can be made painless, with the maximum
code reuse. We illustrate the argument on a simple but representative example
of a rather complicated effect -- non-determinism, including committed choice.
Unexpectedly, it turns out we can write interesting non-deterministic programs

functional-logic language Curry -- and not only run them but also statically
analyze, optimize and compile. The richness of the Meta Language does, in
reality, compensate for the simplicity of the effectful DSL. The key idea goes

towards a new debugger for OCaml which operates by direct interpretation of the

mechanism by which the interpreter could be integrated into compiled

waveguiding structure with wide bandwidth and low dispersion. This work
proposes substrate-less all-dielectric waveguides cladded by an effective
medium for low-loss and low dispersion terahertz transmission in broadband.
This self-supporting structure is built solely into a single silicon wafer with
air perforations to mitigate significant absorptions in metals and dielectrics
at terahertz frequencies. The realized waveguides can cover the entire 260 to
400 GHz with single dominant modes in both orthogonal polarizations. The
simulation shows that for the E_11^x mode the attenuation ranges from 0.003 to
0.024 dB/cm over the entire band, while it varies from 0.008 to 0.023 dB/cm for
the E_11^y mode. Limited by the measurement setup, the maximum error-free data
rate of 28 Gbit/s is experimentally achieved at 335 GHz on a 3-cm waveguide. We
further demonstrate the transmission of uncompressed 4K-resolution video across

  Inter Prediction",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inter prediction is an important module in video coding for temporal
redundancy removal, where similar reference blocks are searched from previously
coded frames and employed to predict the block to be coded. Although
traditional video codecs can estimate and compensate for block-level motions,
their inter prediction performance is still heavily affected by the remaining
inconsistent pixel-wise displacement caused by irregular rotation and
deformation. In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a deep frame
interpolation network to generate additional reference frames in coding
scenarios. First, we summarize the previous adaptive convolutions used for
frame interpolation and propose a factorized kernel convolutional network to
improve the modeling capacity and simultaneously keep its compact form. Second,
to better train this network, multi-domain hierarchical constraints are
introduced to regularize the training of our factorized kernel convolutional
network. For spatial domain, we use a gradually down-sampled and up-sampled
auto-encoder to generate the factorized kernels for frame interpolation at
different scales. For quality domain, considering the inconsistent quality of
the input frames, the factorized kernel convolution is modulated with
quality-related features to learn to exploit more information from high quality
frames. For frequency domain, a sum of absolute transformed difference loss
that performs frequency transformation is utilized to facilitate network
optimization from the view of coding performance. With the well-designed frame
interpolation network regularized by multi-domain hierarchical constraints, our
method surpasses HEVC on average 6.1% BD-rate saving and up to 11.0% BD-rate
saving for the luma component under the random access configuration.

further restrictions on the parameter space of the model, thereby explaining

any given time. An example may be the spin vector of a particle; another
example may be the vector (position, momentum). In this paper, a space of
inaccessible conceptual variables is defined, and group actions are defined on
this space. Accessible functions are then defined on the same space. Assuming
this structure, the basic Hilbert space structure of quantum theory is derived:
Operators on a Hilbert space corresponding to the accessible variables are
introduced; when these operators have a discrete spectrum, a natural model
reduction implies a new model in which the values of the accessible variables
are the eigenvalues of the operator. The principle behind this model reduction
demands that a group action may also be defined also on the accessible
variables; this is possible if the corresponding functions are permissible, a
term that is precisely defined. The following recent principle from statistics
is assumed: every model reduction should be to an orbit or to a set of orbits
of the group. From this derivation, a new interpretation of quantum theory is
briefly discussed: I argue that a state vector may be interpreted as connected
to a focused question posed to nature together with a definite answer to this

proposes a rolling integrated service restoration strategy to minimize the
total system cost by coordinating the scheduling of MESS fleets, resource
dispatching of microgrids and network reconfiguration of distribution systems.
The integrated strategy takes into account damage and repair to both the roads
in transportation networks and the branches in distribution systems. The
uncertainties in load consumption and the status of roads and branches are
modeled as scenario trees using Monte Carlo simulation method. The operation
strategy of MESSs is modeled by a stochastic multi-layer time-space network
technique. A rolling optimization framework is adopted to dynamically update
system damage, and the coordinated scheduling at each time interval over the
prediction horizon is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear
program with temporal-spatial and operation constraints. The proposed model is
verified on two integrated test systems, one is with Sioux Falls transportation
network and four 33-bus distribution systems, and the other is the Singapore
transportation network-based test system connecting six 33-bus distribution
systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of MESS mobility to enhance

resources.

relationships are common. Whereas cooperation and defection are studied
extensively in the literature on game theory, asymmetric exploitative
relationships between players are little explored. In a recent study, Press and
Dyson demonstrate that if only one player can learn about the other, asymmetric
exploitation is achieved in the prisoner's dilemma game. In contrast, however,
it is unknown whether such one-way exploitation is stably established when both
players learn about each other symmetrically and try to optimize their payoffs.
Here, we first formulate a dynamical system that describes the change in a
player's probabilistic strategy with reinforcement learning to obtain greater
payoffs, based on the recognition of the other player. By applying this
formulation to the standard prisoner's dilemma game, we numerically and
analytically demonstrate that an exploitative relationship can be achieved
despite symmetric strategy dynamics and symmetric rule of games. This
exploitative relationship is stable, even though the exploited player, who
receives a lower payoff than the exploiting player, has optimized the own
strategy. Whether the final equilibrium state is mutual cooperation, defection,
or exploitation, crucially depends on the initial conditions: Punishment
against a defector oscillates between the players, and thus a complicated basin
structure to the final equilibrium appears. In other words, slight differences
in the initial state may lead to drastic changes in the final state.
Considering the generality of the result, this study provides a new perspective
on the origin of exploitation in society.

cavity and the environment on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of an atom
qubit system in a dissipation cavity. We obtain the formulae of QFI for two
different initial states and analyze the effect of the atom-cavity coupling and
the cavity-reservoir coupling on the QFI. The results show that the dynamic
behavior of the QFI is obviously dependent on the initial atomic states, the
atom-cavity coupling and the cavity-reservoir coupling. The stronger the
atom-cavity coupling, the quicker the QFI oscillates and the slower the QFI
reduces. Especially, the QFI will tend to a stable value not zero if the
atom-cavity coupling is large enough. On the other hand, the smaller the
cavity-reservoir coupling, the stronger the non-Markovian effect, the slower
the QFI decay. In other words, choosing the best parameter can improve the
accuracy of parameter estimation. In addition, the physical explanation of the
dynamic behavior of the QFI is given by means of the QFI flow.

variability, are frequently used in short and medium-range weather forecasts,
where they are found to improve several aspects of the model. In recent years,
the impact of stochastic physics has also been found to be beneficial for the
model's long term climate. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time
that the inclusion of a stochastic physics scheme can notably affect a model's
projection of global warming, as well as its historical climatological global
temperature. Specifically, we find that when including the 'stochastically
perturbed parametrisation tendencies' scheme (SPPT) in the fully coupled
climate model EC-Earth v3.1, the predicted level of global warming between 1850
and 2100 is reduced by 10% under an RCP8.5 forcing scenario. We link this
reduction in climate sensitivity to a change in the cloud feedbacks with SPPT.
In particular, the scheme appears to reduce the positive low cloud cover
feedback, and increase the negative cloud optical feedback. A key role is
played by a robust, rapid increase in cloud liquid water with SPPT, which we
speculate is due to the scheme's non-linear interaction with condensation.

of the plasma influence on the effects of gravitational lensing, complemented
by pieces of new material and relevant discussions. Deflection of light in the
presence of gravity and plasma is determined by a complex combination of
various physical phenomena: gravity, dispersion, refraction. In particular, the
gravitational deflection itself, in a homogeneous plasma without refraction,
differs from the vacuum one and depends on the frequency of the photon. In an
inhomogeneous plasma, chromatic refraction also takes place. We describe
chromatic effects in strong lens systems including a shift of angular position
of image and a change in magnification. We also investigate high-order images
that arise when lensing on a black hole surrounded by homogeneous plasma. The
recent results of analytical studies of the effect of plasma on the shadow of
the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are presented.

observed, explained by a strong orbital contribution. Importantly, we find that

thousands of years. However, while the inner binary has been studied many
times, information is missing on the other stars, in particular the third star
whose presence was indirectly postulated from recurrent modulations in the
radio domain. Besides, to this date, the X-ray light curve could not be fully
interpreted, for example in the framework of colliding-wind emission linked to
one of the systems. We obtained new optical and X-ray observations of Cyg OB2
#5, which we combined to archival data. We performed a thorough and homogeneous
investigation of all available data, notably revisiting the times of primary
minimum in photometry. In the X-ray domain, XMM-Newton provides scattered
exposures over ~5000 d whilst Swift provides a nearly continuous monitoring for
the last couple of years. Although the X-ray light curve reveals clear
variability, no significant period can be found hence the high-energy emission
cannot be explained solely in terms of colliding winds varying along either the
short or intermediate orbits. The optical data reveal for the first time clear
signs of reflex motion. The photometry indicates the presence of a 2366 d (i.e.
6.5 yr) period while the associated radial velocity changes are detected at the
3 sigma level in the systemic velocity of the He II 4686 emission line. With
the revised period, the radio light curve is interpreted consistently in terms
of a wind interaction between the inner binary and the tertiary star. From

problems, for instance, viral marketing of products in an online social
network, and information propagation of valuable information such as job
vacancy advertisements and health-related information. While existing
algorithmic techniques usually aim at maximizing the total number of people
influenced, the population often comprises several socially salient groups,
e.g., based on gender or race. As a result, these techniques could lead to
disparity across different groups in receiving important information.
Furthermore, in many of these applications, the spread of influence is
time-critical, i.e., it is only beneficial to be influenced before a time
deadline. As we show in this paper, the time-criticality of the information
could further exacerbate the disparity of influence across groups. This
disparity, introduced by algorithms aimed at maximizing total influence, could
have far-reaching consequences, impacting people's prosperity and putting
minority groups at a big disadvantage. In this work, we propose a notion of
group fairness in time-critical influence maximization. We introduce surrogate
objective functions to solve the influence maximization problem under fairness
considerations. By exploiting the submodularity structure of our objectives, we
provide computationally efficient algorithms with guarantees that are effective
in enforcing fairness during the propagation process. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through synthetic and real-world experiments.

of four states of matter; gas, liquid, elastoplastic solids and plasma. The
distinct, interacting physical processes are described by a combination of
compressible, inert and reactive forms of the Euler equations, multiphase
equations, elastoplastic equations and resistive MHD equations. Combinations of
systems of equations are usually solved by coupling finite element for solid
modelling and CFD models for fluid modelling or including material effects
through boundary conditions rather than full material discretisation. Our
simultaneous solution methodology lies on the recasting of all the equations in
the same, hyperbolic form allowing their solution on the same grid with the
same finite-volume numerical schemes. We use a combination of sharp and diffuse
interface methods to track or capture material interfaces, depending on the
application. The communication between the distinct systems of equations (i.e.,
materials separated by sharp interfaces) is facilitated by means of
mixed-material Riemann solvers at the boundaries of the systems, which
represent physical material boundaries. To this end we derive approximate mixed
Riemann solvers for each pair of the above models based on characteristic
equations. To demonstrate the applicability of the new methodology we consider
a case study where we investigate the possibility of ignition of a combustible
gas that lies over a liquid in a metal container that is struck by a plasma-arc
akin to a lightning strike. We study the effect on the ignition of the metal
container material and conductivity, of the presence of a dielectric coating,
of insensitive combustible gases and sealed and pre-damaged metal surfaces.

regions of relativistic outflows. These regions of AGN jets have generally been
modeled by a conical outflow with a roughly constant opening angle and flow
speed. Nonetheless, some works suggest that a parabolic geometry would be more
appropriate to fit the high energy spectral distribution properties and it has
been recently found that, at least in some nearby radio galaxies, the geometry
of the innermost regions of the jet is parabolic. We compile here
multi-frequency core sizes of archival data to investigate the typically
unresolved upstream regions of the jet geometry of a sample of 56 radio-loud
AGNi. Data combined from the sources considered here are not consistent with
the classic picture of a conical jet starting in the vicinity of the
super-massive black hole (SMBH), and may exclude a pure parabolic outflow
solution, but rather suggest an intermediate solution with quasi-parabolic
streams, which are frequently seen in numerical simulations. Inspection of the
large opening angles near the SMBH and the range of the Lorentz factors derived
from our results support our analyses. Our result suggests that the conical jet
paradigm in AGNi needs to be re-examined by millimeter/sub-millimeter VLBI
observations.

determine the main physical parameters of the parsec-scale flow and explore the
implications of the inferred kinematic structure for radiative models of this
gamma-ray emitting jet. The radio data set is comprised of VLBI observations at
15 GHz from the MOJAVE program, and cover a time period of ~2 years. Through a
segmented wavelet decomposition method we estimate the apparent displacement of
individual plasma features; we then perform a pixel-based analysis of the
stacked image to determine the jet shape. The X-ray data set includes all
available observations from the Chandra, XMM, and Swift satellites, and is
used, together with archival data in the other bands, to build the SED. Proper
motion is mostly detected along the edges of the flow, which appears strongly
limb-brightened. The apparent speeds increase as a function of distance from
the core up to a maximum of ~$11.5$ c. This constrains the jet viewing angle to
assume relatively small values ($\theta\lesssim10^{\circ}$). In the
acceleration region, extending up to a de-projected distance of
~$4.8\times10^4$ Schwarzschild radii (~$11$ pc), the jet is collimating
($r\propto z^{0.40\pm 0.04}$), as predicted for a magnetically-driven plasma
flow. By assuming that the core region is indeed magnetically dominated
($U_B/U_e>1$), the SED and the jet power can be well reproduced in the
framework of leptonic models, provided that the high-energy component is
associated to a second emitting region. The possibility that this region is
located at the end of the acceleration zone, either in the jet layer or in the
spine, is explored in the modeling.

model in terms of the zero temperature Drude weight, which can be analytically
calculated. Most interestingly, we reveal that for $1<\alpha<2$, there is a
phase where the zero temperature Drude weight diverges as filling fraction goes
to zero. Thus, in this regime, counter intuitively, reducing number of
particles increases transport and is maximum for a sub-extensive number of
particles. Being a statement about zero-filling, this transport behavior is
immune to adding number conserving interaction terms. We have explicitly
checked this using two different interacting systems. We propose that
measurement of persistent current due to a flux through a mesoscopic ring with
power-law hopping will give an experimental signature of this phase. In
persistent current, the signature of this phase survives up to a finite
temperature for a finite system. At higher temperatures, a crossover is seen.
The maximum persistent current shows a power-law decay at high temperatures.
This is in contrast with short ranged systems, where the persistent current
decays exponentially with temperature.

eccentricity resonance (CER) or a Lindblad eccentricity resonance (LER).
However, the resonance oscillation periods are longer than the 4-year interval
between the switches in the orbits of Janus and Epimetheus. Averaged equations
of motion are used, and our model is numerically integrated to describe the
effects of the periodic sweeping of the 7:6 CERs and LERs over the ring edge
region. We show that four radial zones (ranges 136715-136723, 136738-136749,
136756-136768, 136783-136791 km) are chaotic on decadal timescales, within
which particle semi-major axes have periodic changes due to partial libration
motions around the CER fixed points. After a few decades, the maximum variation
of semi-major axis is about 11 km (respectively 3 km) in the case of the CER
with Janus (respectively Epimetheus). Similarly, particle eccentricities have
partial oscillations forced by the LERs every 4 yr. For initially circular
orbits, the maximum eccentricity reached is ~0.001. We apply our work to
""Peggy"", an object recently discovered at the ring edge, confirming that it is

resummation at the appropriate accuracy for the Standard Model (SM) background

hadronisation and the underlying event, that were not included in our

state-of-the-art tracking performance and have been extensively studied in the
recent few years. Most of the existing CF trackers adopt a cosine window to
spatially reweight base image to alleviate boundary discontinuity. However,
cosine window emphasizes more on the central region of base image and has the
risk of contaminating negative training samples during model learning. On the
other hand, spatial regularization deployed in many recent CF trackers plays a
similar role as cosine window by enforcing spatial penalty on CF coefficients.
Therefore, we in this paper investigate the feasibility to remove cosine window
from CF trackers with spatial regularization. When simply removing cosine
window, CF with spatial regularization still suffers from small degree of
boundary discontinuity. To tackle this issue, binary and Gaussian shaped mask
functions are further introduced for eliminating boundary discontinuity while
reweighting the estimation error of each training sample, and can be
incorporated with multiple CF trackers with spatial regularization. In
comparison to the counterparts with cosine window, our methods are effective in
handling boundary discontinuity and sample contamination, thereby benefiting
tracking performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our
methods perform favorably against the state-of-the-art trackers using either
handcrafted or deep CNN features. The code is publicly available at

compute the diagonal optical conductivity and the Hall conductivity. Comparing
the excitonic optical Hall conductivity to results obtained in the independent
particle approximation, we find an increase in the amplitude corresponding to
one order of magnitude when excitonic effects are included. The Hall
conductivities are used to calculate Faraday rotation spectra for MoS2 and
WSe2. Finally, we have also calculated the diamagnetic shift of the exciton
states of WSe2 in different dielectric environments. Comparing the calculated
diamagnetic shift to recent experimental measurements, we find a very good
agreement between the two.

applications including intersection monitoring, patrolling, and surveillance,
to name a few. However, the problem is involved due to continuouslychanging
camera viewpoint and object appearance as well as the need for lightweight
algorithms to run on on-board embedded systems. To address this issue, the
paper proposes a framework for pedestrian detection in videos based on the YOLO
object detection network [6] while having a high throughput of more than 5 FPS
on the Jetson TX2 embedded board. The framework exploits deep learning for
robust operation and uses a pre-trained model without the need for any
additional training which makes it flexible to apply on different setups with
minimum amount of tuning. The method achieves ~81 mAP when applied on a sample
video from the Embedded Real-Time Inference (ERTI) Challenge where pedestrians
are monitored by a UAV.

behaviour of particle accelerators. Even these complex models often do not
describe the measured data. Interactions of the beam with external fields,
other particles in the same beam and the beam walls all present modelling
challenges. These can be challenging to model correctly even with modern
supercomputers. This paper describes OPAL (Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator
Library), a parallel open source tool for charged-particle optics in linear
accelerators and rings, including 3D space charge. OPAL is built from the
ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact that high performance
computing is the third leg of science, complementing theory and experiment.
Using the MAD language with extensions, OPAL can run on a laptop as well as on
the largest high performance computing systems. The OPAL framework makes it
easy to add new features in the form of new C++ classes, enabling the modelling
of many physics processes and field types. OPAL comes in two flavours:
OPAL-cycl: tracks particles with 3D space charge including neighbouring turns
in cyclotrons and FFAs with time as the independent variable. OPAL-t: models
beam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors and complete XFELs excluding the
undulator. The code is managed through the git distributed version control
system. A suite of unit tests have been developed for various parts of OPAL,
validating each part of the code independently. System tests validate the
overall integration of different elements.

improvements using language models (LMs). Recent studies have tried to use
bidirectional LMs (biLMs) instead of conventional unidirectional LMs (uniLMs)
for rescoring the $N$-best list decoded from the acoustic model. In spite of
their theoretical benefits, the biLMs have not given notable improvements
compared to the uniLMs in their experiments. This is because their biLMs do not
consider the interaction between the two directions. In this paper, we propose
a novel sentence scoring method considering the interaction between the past
and the future words on the biLM. Our experimental results on the LibriSpeech
corpus show that the biLM with the proposed sentence scoring outperforms the
uniLM for the $N$-best list rescoring, consistently and significantly in all
experimental conditions. The analysis of WERs by word position demonstrates
that the biLM is more robust than the uniLM especially when a recognized
sentence is short or a misrecognized word is at the beginning of the sentence.

is the energy defined for a knot, and O'Hara energy was introduced for defining

invariance under Moebius transformation, this energy is called Moebius energy.
Although discretization for various Moebius energies has been defined to
analyse the shape of the minimizer so far, only Gamma-convergence to the

We conclude three key tasks during vision-based robotic grasping, which are
object localization, object pose estimation and grasp estimation. In detail,
the object localization task contains object localization without
classification, object detection and object instance segmentation. This task
provides the regions of the target object in the input data. The object pose
estimation task mainly refers to estimating the 6D object pose and includes
correspondence-based methods, template-based methods and voting-based methods,
which affords the generation of grasp poses for known objects. The grasp
estimation task includes 2D planar grasp methods and 6DoF grasp methods, where
the former is constrained to grasp from one direction. These three tasks could
accomplish the robotic grasping with different combinations. Lots of object
pose estimation methods need not object localization, and they conduct object
localization and object pose estimation jointly. Lots of grasp estimation
methods need not object localization and object pose estimation, and they
conduct grasp estimation in an end-to-end manner. Both traditional methods and
latest deep learning-based methods based on the RGB-D image inputs are reviewed
elaborately in this survey. Related datasets and comparisons between
state-of-the-art methods are summarized as well. In addition, challenges about
vision-based robotic grasping and future directions in addressing these
challenges are also pointed out.

theoretically distinguish cosmological models in which acceleration is due to
modified gravity from those in which it is due to the properties of matter or
fields. In this paper we review the concept of self-acceleration as given, for
example, by [1], and highlight two problems. First, that it applies only to
universal couplings, and second, that it is too narrow, i.e. it excludes models
in which the acceleration can be shown to be induced by a genuine modification
of gravity, for instance coupled dark energy with a universal coupling, the
Hu-Sawicki f(R) model or, in the context of inflation, the Starobinski model.
We then propose two new, more general, concepts in its place:
force-acceleration and field-acceleration, which are also applicable in
presence of non universal cosmologies. We illustrate their concrete application
with two examples, among the modified gravity classes which are still in
agreement with current data, i.e. f(R) models and coupled dark energy.

as Friedel oscillations (FO). Indeed the two phenomena are similar and related,
posing a challenge to their experimental differentiation. Here we report a
resonant X-ray diffraction study of ZrTe$_3$, a model CDW material. Near the

concomitantly, only to become clearly separated in momentum while developing
very different correlation lengths in the well-ordered state. Anomalously slow

we first consider a previously proposed mask-compliant spectral precoding

high computational complexity, notably in large-scale systems. To mitigate the
complexity of computing the LS-MSP, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach
that breaks the original problem into smaller rank 1 quadratic-constraint
problems and each small problem yields closed-form solution. Based on these
solutions, we develop three specialized first-order low-complexity algorithms,
based on 1) projection on convex sets and 2) the alternating direction method
of multipliers. We also develop an algorithm that capitalizes on the
closed-form solutions for the rank 1 quadratic constraints, which is referred
to as 3) semi-analytical spectral precoding. Numerical results show that the
proposed LS-MSP techniques outperform previously proposed techniques in terms
of the computational burden while complying with the spectrum mask. The results
also indicate that 3) typically needs 3 iterations to achieve similar results
as 1) and 2) at the expense of a slightly increased computational complexity.

Using a first principle based approach combined with an exact treatment of the
disorder, we address the impact of vacancies on phonon lifetimes and thermal
transport in graphene. We find that perturbation theory fails completely and
overestimates phonon lifetimes by almost two orders of magnitude. Whilst, in
defected graphene, LA and TA modes remain well defined, the ZA modes become
marginal. In the long wavelength limit, the ZA dispersion changes from
quadratic to linear and the scattering rate is found proportional to the phonon
energy, in contrast to the quadratic scaling often assumed. The impact on
thermal transport, calculated beyond the relaxation time approximation and
including first principle phonon-phonon scattering rates as reported recently
for pristine graphene, reveals spectacular effects even for extremely low
vacancy concentrations.

is the reduced semigroup $C^*$-algebra for the additive semigroup of
non-negative integers. It is known that every partially ordered set can be
represented as the union of the family of its maximal upward directed subsets
indexed by elements of some set. In our previous work we have studied a
topology on this set of indexes. For every maximal upward directed subset we
consider the inductive system of Toeplitz algebras that is defined by a given
inductive system over an arbitrary partially ordered set and its inductive
limit. Then for a base neighbourhood $U_a$ of the topology on the set of
indexes we construct the $C^*$-algebra $\mathfrak{B}_a$ which is the direct
product of those inductive limits. In this note we continue studying the
connection between the properties of the topology on the set of indexes and
properties of inductive limits for systems consisting of $C^*$-algebras
$\mathfrak{B}_a$ and their $*$-homorphisms. It is proved that there exists an
embedding of the reduced semigroup $C^*$-algebra for a semigroup in the

with two initial states at half-filling: (i) product state with doublons

\downarrow 0 \uparrow \downarrow \rangle$ and (ii) product state with singlons
$|\uparrow \ \downarrow \ \uparrow \ \downarrow \ \uparrow \ \downarrow \

real-time evolution via the fermionic Hamiltonian using exact

finite Matrix product states(MPSs), within experimentally relevant time scales.
For the product state with doublons, we observe a delocalized to localized
phase transition varying disorder strengths, by monitoring the decay of charge
imbalance with time. For the long-range interacting Hamiltonian of our focus,
and in the presence of strong enough disorder, starting the time evolution with
singlons we find a strong reduction in the spin delocalization, contrary to
results of previous studies using the disordered short-range (on-site) Hubbard
model with SU(2) symmetry. Our predictions for localization of both charge and

needs to send timely status updates to a remote destination. The timeliness of
status updates is measured by a non-decreasing penalty function of the Age of
Information (AoI). The problem is to find a policy for generating updates that
achieves the lowest possible time-average expected age penalty among all online
policies. We prove that one optimal solution of this problem is a monotone
threshold policy, which satisfies (i) each new update is sent out only when the
age is higher than a threshold and (ii) the threshold is a non-increasing
function of the instantaneous battery level. Let $\tau_B$ denote the optimal
threshold corresponding to the full battery level $B$, and $p(\cdot)$ denote
the age-penalty function, then we can show that $p(\tau_B)$ is equal to the
optimum objective value, i.e., the minimum achievable time-average expected age
penalty. These structural properties are used to develop an algorithm to
compute the optimal thresholds. Our numerical analysis indicates that the
improvement in average age with added battery capacity is largest at small
battery sizes; specifically, more than half the total possible reduction in age
is attained when battery storage increases from one transmission's worth of
energy to two. This encourages further study of status update policies for
sensors with small battery storage.

and intrinsic material properties is simulated based on the

leading-order (LO) $k_T$-factorization calculations for this process with
tree-level next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
matrix elements. For the first time we include in this framework 2 $\to$ 3 and
2 $\to$ 4 processes with extra partonic emissions for single particle
distributions as well as for correlation observables. The use of the KMR uPDF
leads to a good description of the existing charm ($D$-meson) data already at
the leading-order. On the other hand, a new Parton-Branching (PB) uPDF strongly
underestimates the same experimental data. A direct inclusion of the
higher-orders at tree-level leads to an overestimation of the data, especially
for the KMR uPDF. This suggests a significant double-counting. We propose a
simple method how to avoid the double-counting. Our procedure leads to a much
better description of the experimental data when including the higher-order
contributions. Then with the KMR uPDF we get similar results (both for single
particle and correlation observables) as for the standard calculations of the 2
$\to$ 2 processes. For the PB uPDF inclusion of the higher-orders considerably
improves description of the experimental data. We conclude that the LO
calculation with the KMR uPDF effectively includes the higher-orders which is
not the case for the PB uPDF.

services to attract subscribers and increase revenues. For example, the data
trading market enables user-flexibility by allowing users to sell leftover data
to or buy extra data from each other. The rollover mechanism enables
time-flexibility by allowing a user to utilize his own leftover data from the
previous month in the current month. In this paper, we investigate the economic
viability of offering the data trading market together with the rollover
mechanism, to gain a deeper understanding of the interrelationship between the
user-flexibility and the time-flexibility. We formulate the interactions
between the MNO and mobile users as a multi-slot dynamic game. Specifically, in
each time slot (e.g., every day), the MNO first determines the selling and
buying prices with the goal of revenue maximization, then each user decides his
trading action (by solving a dynamic programming problem) to maximize his
long-term payoff. Due to the availability of monthly data rollover, a user's
daily trading decision corresponds to a dynamic programming problem with two
time scales (i.e., day-to-day and month-to-month). Our analysis reveals an
optimal trading policy with a target interval structure, specified by a
buy-up-to threshold and a sell-down-to threshold in each time slot. Moreover,
we show that the rollover mechanism makes users sell less and buy more data
given the same trading prices, hence it increases the total demand while
decreasing the total supply in the data trading market. Finally, numerical
results based on real-world data unveil that the time-flexible rollover
mechanism plays a positive role in the user-flexible data trading market,
increasing the MNO's revenue by 25% and all users' payoff by 17% on average.

(GIRG) are two similar generative network models that were designed to resemble
complex real world networks. In particular, they have a power-law degree
distribution with controllable exponent $\beta$, and high clustering that can
be controlled via the temperature $T$.
  We present the first implementation of an efficient GIRG generator running in
expected linear time. Besides varying temperatures, it also supports underlying
geometries of higher dimensions. It is capable of generating graphs with ten
million edges in under a second on commodity hardware. The algorithm can be
adapted to HRGs. Our resulting implementation is the fastest sequential HRG
generator, despite the fact that we support non-zero temperatures. Though
non-zero temperatures are crucial for many applications, most existing
generators are restricted to $T = 0$. Our generators support parallelization,
although this is not the focus of this paper. We note that our generators draw
from the correct probability distribution, i.e., they involve no approximation.
  Besides the generators themselves, we also provide an efficient algorithm to
determine the non-trivial dependency between the average degree of the
resulting graph and the input parameters of the GIRG model. This makes it
possible to specify the expected average degree as input.
  Moreover, we investigate the differences between HRGs and GIRGs, shedding new
light on the nature of the relation between the two models. Although HRGs
represent, in a certain sense, a special case of the GIRG model, we find that a
straight-forward inclusion does not hold in practice. However, the difference
is negligible for most use cases.

reduced density matrices which eigenvalues describe the entanglement between
higher-spin modes with different spin values. We compute the entanglement
entropy on these OSFT solutions, and the answer is expressed in terms of
converging series in inverse weighted partition numbers. In the case of
$D$-dimensional bosonic string theory, the entanglement entropy of spin $1$
subsystem and the system of all the spin values is given by
$D{\log{\lambda_0}}+{D\over{\lambda_0}}\sum_{N=3}^\infty{{|\beta(N)|}\over{\lambda(N)}}

$\lambda_0=\sum_{N=1}^{\infty}{{\beta(N)}\over{\lambda(N)}}$ ($\zeta$ is

entanglement swapping between string vacuum and string excitations.

old stellar systems like globular clusters produce fewer post-(early) AGB stars

optical spectra. We calculated evolutionary sequences for four metallicity
regimes and used them together with information about the HB morphology of the
globular clusters to estimate the expected numbers of post-AGB stars. Seven of
the eleven new luminous UV-bright stars are post-AGB or post-early AGB stars,
two are evolving away from the HB, one is a foreground white dwarf, and one is
a white dwarf merger. So spectroscopy is clearly required to identify the
evolutionary status of hot UV-bright stars. For hotter stars, metal-rich model
spectra are required to reproduce their optical and UV spectra, which may
affect the flux contribution of hot post-AGB stars to the UV spectra of evolved
populations. Adding published information on other hot UV-bright stars in

constraint of sparsity, but reconstruction remains slow. Here we propose a
novel framework that significantly improves both the performance and speed of
signal recovery by jointly training a generator and the optimisation process
for reconstruction via meta-learning. We explore training the measurements with
different objectives, and derive a family of models based on minimising
measurement errors. We show that Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) can be
viewed as a special case in this family of models. Borrowing insights from the
CS perspective, we develop a novel way of improving GANs using gradient
information from the discriminator.

function $f : V \longrightarrow \{0, 1, 2,3\}$ having the property that if
$f(v)=0$ for some vertex $v$, then $v$ has at least two neighbors assigned $2$
under $f$ or one neighbor $w$ with $f(w)=3$, and if $f(v)=1$ then $v$ has at
least one neighbor $w$ with $f(w) \geq 2$. The weight of a DRDF $f$ is the sum
$f (V) =\sum_{u\in V} f (u)$. The minimum weight of a DRDF on a graph $G$ is
the double Roman domination number of $G$ and is denoted by $\gamma_{dR}(G)$.
The double roman bondage number of $G$, denoted by $b_{dR}(G)$, is the minimum
cardinality among all edge subsets $B \subseteq E(G)$ such that
$\gamma_{dR}(G-B) > \gamma_{dR}(G)$. In this paper we study the double roman
bondage number in graphs. We determine the double roman bondage number in
several families of graphs, and present several bounds for the double roman
bondage number. We also study the complexity issue of the double roman bondage
number and prove that the decision problem for the double roman bondage number
is NP-hard even when restricted to bipartite graphs.

the dipole-dipole interaction and form collective plasmonic modes which extend
over the whole metasurface. Within a Hamiltonian model which we solve exactly,
we derive general expressions which enable us to extract analytically the

an open quantum system approach, we consider perturbatively the coupling of the

shift, when added to the quasistatic dispersion relation, provides an
approximate analytical description of the fully retarded band structure of the

have received a large amount of attention in fields such as sensing and quantum
optomechanics due to their exceptionally high quality factors ($Q$s).
Room-temperature $Q$s approaching 1 billion are now in reach by means of
phononic crystals (soft-clamping) and strain engineering. Despite great
progress in enhancing $Q$s, difficulties in fabrication of soft-clamped samples
limits their implementation into actual devices. An alternative means of
achieving ultra-high $Q$s was shown using trampoline resonators with engineered
clamps, which serves to localize the stress to the center of the resonator,
while minimizing stress at the clamping. The effectiveness of this approach has
since come into question from recent studies employing string resonators with
clamp-tapering. Here, we investigate this idea using nanomechanical string
resonators with engineered clampings similar to those presented for
trampolines. Importantly, the effect of orienting the strings diagonally or
perpendicularly with respect to the silicon frame is investigated. It is found
that increasing the clamp width for diagonal strings slightly increases the
$Q$s of the fundamental out-of-plane mode at small radii, while perpendicular
strings only deteriorate with increasing clamp width. Measured $Q$s agree well
with finite element method simulations even for higher-order resonances. The
small increase cannot account for previously reported $Q$s of trampoline
resonators. Instead, we propose the effect to be intrinsic and related to
surface and radiation losses.

neural networks on medical images. As annotating data is expensive and
time-consuming, it is difficult for an individual medical center to reach large
enough sample sizes to build their own, personalized models. As an alternative,
data from all centers could be pooled to train a centralized model that
everyone can use. However, such a strategy is often infeasible due to the
privacy-sensitive nature of medical data. Recently, federated learning (FL) has
been introduced to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model across
centers without the need for sharing data. In FL, clients are locally training
models on site-specific datasets for a few epochs and then sharing their model
weights with a central server, which orchestrates the overall training process.
Importantly, the sharing of models does not compromise patient privacy. A
disadvantage of FL is the dependence on a central server, which requires all
clients to agree on one trusted central body, and whose failure would disrupt
the training process of all clients. In this paper, we introduce BrainTorrent,
a new FL framework without a central server, particularly targeted towards
medical applications. BrainTorrent presents a highly dynamic peer-to-peer
environment, where all centers directly interact with each other without
depending on a central body. We demonstrate the overall effectiveness of FL for
the challenging task of whole brain segmentation and observe that the proposed
server-less BrainTorrent approach does not only outperform the traditional
server-based one but reaches a similar performance to a model trained on pooled

$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants that characterizes different topological
phases and determines the presence or absence of surface Dirac cones. This is
demonstrated by considering a bosonic counterpart of the Fu-Kane-Mele model on
a diamond lattice. The model is found to exhibit three distinct phases
analogous to strong topological, weak topological, and trivial insulator phases
of the original fermionic model. We also discuss a possible realization of the
thermal Hall effect of surface magnons in the presence of a magnetic field in
proximity to a normal ferromagnet.

much harder than its online counterpart due to the absence of temporal
information. In order to take advantage of the more mature methods for online
recognition and save resources, an oversegmentation approach is proposed to
recover strokes from textual bitmap images automatically. The proposed
algorithm first breaks down the skeleton of a binarized image into junctions
and segments, then segments are merged to form strokes, finally stroke order is
normalized by using recursive projection and topological sort. Good offline
accuracy was obtained in combination with ordinary online recognizers, which
are not specially designed for extracted strokes. Given a ready-made
state-of-the-art online handwritten mathematical expression recognizer, the
proposed procedure correctly recognized 58.22%, 65.65%, and 65.22% of the
offline formulas rendered from the datasets of the Competitions on Recognition
of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions(CROHME) in 2014, 2016, and 2019
respectively. Furthermore, given a trainable online recognition system,
retraining it with extracted strokes resulted in an offline recognizer with the
same level of accuracy. On the other hand, the speed of the entire pipeline was
fast enough to facilitate on-device recognition on mobile phones with limited
resources. To conclude, stroke extraction provides an attractive way to build
optical character recognition software.

the pay-off for states with such delicate quantum properties is their

losses. We use the framework of open quantum systems and master equations to
describe losses in n-photon-subtracted multimode states, where each photon can
be subtracted in an arbitrary mode. As a main result, we find that
mode-dependent losses and photon-subtraction generally do not commute. In
particular, the losses do not only reduce the purity of the state, they also
change the modal structure of its non-Gaussian features. We then conduct a
detailed study of single-photon subtraction from a multimode Gaussian state,
which is a setting that lies within the reach of present-day experiments.

($p=1/2$) Bernoulli site percolation converge in the scaling limit to a

  1. The triangulation, viewed as a curve-decorated metric measure space
equipped with its graph distance, the counting measure on vertices, and a
single percolation interface converges with respect to a version of the
Gromov-Hausdorff topology.
  2. There is a bijective encoding of the site-percolated triangulation by
means of a two-dimensional random walk, and this walk converges to the
correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion which encodes SLE$_6$-decorated
$\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG via the mating-of-trees theorem of Duplantier-Miller-Sheffield
(2014); this is sometimes called $\textit{peanosphere convergence}$.
  We prove that one in fact has $\textit{joint}$ convergence in both of these
two senses simultaneously. We also improve the metric convergence result by
showing that the map decorated by the full collection of percolation interfaces
(rather than just a single interface) converges to $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG decorated
by CLE$_6$ in the metric space sense.
  This is the first work to prove simultaneous convergence of any random planar
map model in the metric and peanosphere senses. Moreover, this work is an

conclude then that the whole of quantum theory should be described through a

accordance with a supervaluational semantics (that allows one to retain all the

reaction pathway that can form HCOOH and CO2 ice at 10 K 'non-energetically' in
the laboratory under conditions related to the ""heavy"" CO freeze-out stage in
dense interstellar clouds, i.e., by the hydrogenation of an H2CO:O2 ice
mixture. This pathway is used to piece together the HCOOH and CO2 formation
routes when H2CO or CO reacts with H and OH radicals. Temperature programmed
desorption - quadrupole mass spectrometry (TPD-QMS) is used to confirm the
formation and pathways of newly synthesized ice species as well as to provide
information on relative molecular abundances. Reflection absorption infrared
spectroscopy (RAIRS) is additionally employed to characterize reaction products
and determine relative molecular abundances. We find that for the conditions
investigated in conjunction with theoretical results from the literature,
H+HOCO and HCO+OH lead to the formation of HCOOH ice in our experiments. Which
reaction is more dominant can be determined if the H+HOCO branching ratio is
more constrained by computational simulations, as the HCOOH:CO2 abundance ratio
is experimentally measured to be around 1.8:1. H+HOCO is more likely than OH+CO
(without HOCO formation) to form CO2. Isotope experiments presented here
further validate that H+HOCO is the dominant route for HCOOH ice formation in a
CO-rich CO:O2 ice mixture that is hydrogenated. These data will help in the
search and positive identification of HCOOH ice in prestellar cores.

ferromagnetic resonance excitations of a Permalloy (Py) disk - Cobalt (Co)
stripe bilayer microstructure. The transverse high frequency component of the
resonantly excited magnetization is sampled in the ps regime by a combination
of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy
(STXM- FMR) recording snapshots of the local magnetization precession of Py and
Co with nanometer spatial resolution. The approach allows us to individually
image the resonant dynamic response of each element, and we find that angular
momentum is transferred from the Py disk to the Co stripe and vice versa at
their respective resonances. The integral (cavity) FMR spectrum of our sample
shows an unexpected additional third resonance. This resonance is observed in
the STXM-FMR experiments as well and our microscopic findings suggest that it
is governed by magnetic exchange between Py and Co, showing for the Co stripe a
difference in relative phase of the magnetization due to stray field influence.

  Residential Load Forecasting","9 pages, 4 figures, journal",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Load forecasting has long been recognized as an important building block for
all utility operational planning efforts. Over the recent years, it has become
ever more challenging to make accurate forecasts due to the proliferation of
distributed energy resources, despite the abundance of existing load
forecasting methods. In this paper, we identify one drawback suffered by most
load forecasting methods: neglect to thoroughly address the impact of input
errors on load forecasts. As a potential solution, we propose to incorporate
input modeling and uncertainty quantification to improve load forecasting
performance via a two-stage approach. The proposed two-stage approach has the
following merits. (1) It provides input modeling and quantifies the impact of
input errors, rather than neglecting or mitigating the impact, a prevalent
practice of existing methods. (2) It propagates the impact of input errors into
the ultimate point and interval predictions for the target customer's load to
improve predictive performance. (3) A variance-based global sensitivity
analysis method is further proposed for input-space dimensionality reduction in
both stages to enhance the computational efficiency. Numerical experiments show
that the proposed two-stage approach outperforms competing load forecasting
methods in terms of both point predictive accuracy and coverage ability of the
predictive intervals.

to incomplete skeletons, we propose a multi-stream graph convolutional network

skeleton joints. Here, each stream of the network is only responsible for
learning features from currently unactivated joints, which are distinguished by
the class activation maps (CAM) obtained by preceding streams, so that the
activated joints of the proposed method are obviously more than traditional
methods. Thus, the proposed method is termed richly activated GCN (RA-GCN),
where the richly discovered features will improve the robustness of the model.
Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the RA-GCN achieves comparable
performance on the NTU RGB+D dataset. Moreover, on a synthetic occlusion

significantly.

notoriously difficult task, even for electron-phonon paired superconductors for
which the theory is relatively well understood. Early attempts by McMillan and
Allen and Dynes to improve on the weak-coupling BCS formula led to closed-form
approximate relations between $T_c$ and various measures of the phonon spectrum
and the electron-phonon interaction appearing in Eliashberg theory. Here we
propose that these approaches can be improved with the use of machine learning
algorithms. As an initial test, we train a model for identifying
low-dimensional descriptors using the $T_c < 10$ K data tested by Allen and
Dynes, and show that a simple analytical expression thus obtained improves upon
the Allen-Dynes fit. Furthermore, the prediction for the recently discovered
high $T_c$ material H$_3$S at high pressure is quite reasonable. Interestingly,
$T_c$'s for more recently discovered superconducting systems with a more
two-dimensional electron-phonon coupling, which do not follow Allen and Dynes'
expression, also do not follow our analytic expression. Thus, this machine
learning approach appears to be a powerful method for highlighting the need for
a new descriptor beyond those used by Allen and Dynes to describe their set of
isotropic electron-phonon coupled superconductors. We argue that this machine
learning method, and its implied need for a descriptor characterizing Fermi
surface properties, represents a promising new approach to superconductor
materials discovery which may eventually replace the serendipitous discovery
paradigm begun by Kamerlingh Onnes.

searching collaboratively for an exit at an unknown location on the line. They
can travel at maximum speed $b$ and can change speed or direction at any time.
The two robots can communicate with each other at any distance and at any time.
The task is completed when the last robot arrives at the exit and evacuates. We
study time-energy tradeoffs for the above evacuation problem. The evacuation
time is the time it takes the last robot to reach the exit. The energy it takes
for a robot to travel a distance $x$ at speed $s$ is measured as $xs^2$. The
total and makespan evacuation energies are respectively the sum and maximum of
the energy consumption of the two robots while executing the evacuation
algorithm.
  Assuming that the maximum speed is $b$, and the evacuation time is at most
$cd$, where $d$ is the distance of the exit from the origin, we study the
problem of minimizing the total energy consumption of the robots. We prove that
the problem is solvable only for $bc \geq 3$. For the case $bc=3$, we give an
optimal algorithm, and give upper bounds on the energy for the case $bc>3$.
  We also consider the problem of minimizing the evacuation time when the
available energy is bounded by $\Delta$. Surprisingly, when $\Delta$ is a
constant, independent of the distance $d$ of the exit from the origin, we prove
that evacuation is possible in time $O(d^{3/2}\log d)$, and this is optimal up
to a logarithmic factor. When $\Delta$ is linear in $d$, we give upper bounds
on the evacuation time.

activation maps (TAMs) for class names as well as compound concepts, i.e.
combinations of nouns and their attributes. The TAMs of compound concepts
describing classes of interest substantially improve the quality of the

converted to free carriers primarily at the anode of our device. In the
near-field regime, strongly confined SPPs are launched, routed and detected in
a 20nm narrow region at the interface between the waveguide and the monolayer

~0.03$\mu m ^2$ that absorbs 86% of the propagating energy in the SPP. Due to
the electromagnetic character of the SPPs, the spectral response is essentially
identical to the far-field regime, exhibiting strong resonances close to the
exciton energies. While most of our experiments are performed on monolayer
thick MoSe$_2$, the photocurrent-per-layer increases super linearly in
multilayer devices due to the suppression of radiative exciton recombination.

simplified expressions for the equation-of-state functions: the dark sector
entropy perturbations $w_{\rm ds}\Gamma_{\rm ds}$ and anisotropic stress
$w_{\rm ds}\Pi_{\rm ds}$. From this we derive a growth factor-like equation for

utilize the new data over transformed images, called data augmentation

whereas some other DATs that severely impact human gaze degrade the
performance. These label preserving valid augmentation transformations provide
a solution to enlarge existing saliency datasets. Finally, we introduce a novel

modified UNet is proposed as the generator of the GazeGAN, which combines
classic skip connections with a novel center-surround connection (CSC), in

RingNet leverages multiple images of a person and automatically detected 2D

similar when the identity is the same and different for different people. We
achieve invariance to expression by representing the face using the FLAME

thoroughly investigate the case where the deterministic system permits a
uniformly hyperbolic stable slow manifold. In this setting, we provide a
neighborhood, tailored to the fast-slow structure of the system, that contains
the process with high probability. We prove this assertion by providing
exponential error estimates on the probability that the system leaves this
neighborhood. We also illustrate our results in an example arising in climate
modeling, where time-correlated noise processes have become of greater
relevance recently.

processors, supporting multiprocessing and enforcing security. Historically,
the design of the address translation mechanisms has been closely tied to the
instruction set. In contrast, RISC-V defines its privileged specification in a
way that permits a variety of designs.
  An important part of the design space is the organisation of Translation
Lookaside Buffers (TLBs). This paper presents our recent work on simulating TLB
behaviours in multi-core RISC-V systems. Our TLB simulation framework allows
rapid, flexible and versatile prototyping of various hardware TLB design
choices, and enables validation, profiling and benchmarking of software running
on RISC-V systems. We show how this framework can be integrated with the
dynamic binary translated emulator QEMU to perform online simulation. When
simulating complicated multi-level shared TLB designs, the framework runs at
around 400 million instructions per second (MIPS) when simulating an 8-core
system. The performance overhead compared to unmodified QEMU is only 18% when
the benchmark's L1 TLB miss rate is 1%.
  We also demonstrate how this tool can be used to explore the instruction-set
level design space. We test a shared last-level TLB design that is not
currently permitted by the RISC-V's privileged specification. We then propose
an extension to RISC-V's virtual memory system design based on these
experimental results.

physical processes, and formation and evolutionary histories. Atmospheric
spectroscopy provides a direct avenue to probe exoplanetary compositions.
However, whether obtained in transit or thermal emission, spectroscopic
observations probe limited pressure windows of planetary atmospheres and are
directly sensitive to only a limited set of spectroscopically active species.
It is therefore critical to have chemical models that can relate retrieved
atmospheric compositions to an atmosphere's bulk physical and chemical state.
To this end we present LEVI, a new chemical kinetics code for modelling
exoplanetary atmospheres. LEVI calculates the gas phase hydrogen, oxygen,
carbon, and nitrogen chemistry in planetary atmospheres. Here we focus on hot
gas giants. Applying LEVI, we investigate how variations in bulk C/O and N/O
affects the observable atmospheric chemistry in hot Jupiters. For typical hot
Jupiters we demonstrate the strong sensitivity of molecular detections to the
atmospheric C/O. Molecular detections are conversely less sensitive to the
atmospheric N/O ratio, although highly super-solar N/O can decrease the C/O
required for HCN and NH3 detection. Using a new P-T profile for HD 209458b
without a thermal inversion, we evaluate recently reported detection's of CO,
H2O and HCN in its day-side atmosphere. We find that our models are consistent
with the detected species, albeit with a narrow compositional window around C/O
$\sim$ 1. A C/O $\gtrsim$ 0.9 (1.6 times solar) was required to meet the
minimum reported value for HCN, while a C/O $\lesssim$ 1 (1.8 times solar) was
required to fit the nominal H2O abundance.

stability of Pearl's notion of causality was first studied in Schulman and

the parameter recovery is stable. We further prove that \emph{randomly} chosen
input parameters for this family satisfy the condition with a substantial
probability. Hence for this family, on a large subset of parameter space,
recovery is numerically stable. Next we construct an example of $\LSEM$ on four
vertices with \emph{unbounded} condition number. We then corroborate our
theoretical findings via simulations as well as real-world experiments for a
sociology application. Finally, we provide a general heuristic for estimating
the condition number of any $\LSEM$ instance.

used to give approximations for the state function and some of its derivatives.
To this aim, we use the fractional order integration operational matrix of the

Riemann-Liouville integral operators. Using results of the considered basis
functions, solving the fractional optimal control problem is reduced to the
solution of a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. An error bound is proved
for the approximate optimal value of the performance index obtained by the
proposed method. The method is then generalized for solving a class of
fractional optimal control problems with inequality constraints. The most

However, SP yields postconditions that are exponentially large, which makes
them difficult to use, either by humans or by tools. Our key idea is an
algorithm that converts such exponentially large specifications into a form

structure of the specifications that result from the use of SP. We applied our

measurements by the Mars Atmosphere and Evolution (MAVEN) Accelerometer (ACC)

sufficiently long vertical wavelengths to propagate into the thermosphere, and
are predicted by classical wave theory to be equatorially trapped. These prior
measurements characterized UFKWs at two relatively narrow altitude bands, with
one measurement altitude near 80 km and a second near 150 km. Thermospheric
density profiles from solar occultation (SO) measurements made by the Extreme
Ultraviolet Monitor (EUVM) onboard MAVEN [2] provide a means to characterize
multi-sol period waves, including UFKWs, as a function of altitude. In this
study, we present first-ever observations of UFKWs as a function of altitude,
including observations of rapid wave energy dissipation near 170 km indicative
of wave breaking.

non-negative functions are characterized by specific properties of scale
invariance and relative scale which enable to represent them with the unit
integral constraint without loss of information. On the other hand, all these
properties are a challenge when the densities need to be approximated with
spline functions, including construction of the respective spline basis. The
Bayes space methodology of density functions enables to express them as real
functions in the standard $L^2$ space using the centered log-ratio
transformation. The resulting functions satisfy the zero integral constraint.
This is a key to propose a new spline basis, holding the same property, and
consequently to build a new class of spline functions, called compositional
splines, which can approximate probability density functions in a consistent
way. The paper provides also construction of smoothing compositional splines
and possible orthonormalization of the spline basis which might be useful in
some applications. Finally, statistical processing of densities using the new
approximation tool is demonstrated in case of simplicial functional principal
component analysis with anthropometric data.

simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars ($\leq$1 $M_\odot$).
Unfortunately, rotation period $(P_{\rm rot})$ measurements of low-mass members
of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common
age dependence (i.e., $P_{\rm rot} \propto \sqrt{\rm age}$): K dwarfs appear to
spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Ag\""ueros et al. (2018) interpreted
data for the $\approx$1.4-Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that
after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr
(by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf $P_{\rm rot}$ stall on that sequence for an
extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely
single-star members of the $\approx$1-Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler
light curves. We measure $P_{\rm rot}$ for 171 members, more than doubling the
sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from
$\approx$0.8 to $\approx$0.6 $M_\odot$. We then apply a gyrochronology formula
calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to
derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04$\pm$0.07 Gyr.
However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color-$P_{\rm
rot}$ sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to $T_{\rm
eff} \approx 4295$ K (K5V, 0.7 $M_\odot$), where it clearly overlaps with
Praesepe's. Combining these data with $P_{\rm rot}$ for other clusters, we
conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is
invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience
a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where $P_{\rm rot}$ stall, and
that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.

Gaussian cluster and number of background stars were varied to determine the
tests' ability to reject complete spatial randomness (CSR) with changing
signal-to-noise. The best performing test was O-ring optimised with overlapping
logarithmic bins, closely followed by Ripley's K. The O-ring test is equivalent
to the 2-point correlation function. Both F and G (and the minimum spanning

cluster with a factor of two higher signal-to-noise in order to reject CSR
consistently. We demonstrate the tests on example astrophysical datasets drawn

are programs managing accounts on a blockchain. Greybox fuzzing is a
lightweight test-generation approach that effectively detects bugs and security
vulnerabilities. However, greybox fuzzers randomly mutate program inputs to
exercise new paths; this makes it challenging to cover code that is guarded by
narrow checks, which are satisfied by no more than a few input values.
Moreover, most real-world smart contracts transition through many different
states during their lifetime, e.g., for every bid in an auction. To explore
these states and thereby detect deep vulnerabilities, a greybox fuzzer would
need to generate sequences of contract transactions, e.g., by creating bids
from multiple users, while at the same time keeping the search space and test
suite tractable. In this experience paper, we explain how Harvey alleviates
both challenges with two key fuzzing techniques and distill the main lessons
learned. First, Harvey extends standard greybox fuzzing with a method for
predicting new inputs that are more likely to cover new paths or reveal
vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Second, it fuzzes transaction sequences in
a targeted and demand-driven way. We have evaluated our approach on 27
real-world contracts. Our experiments show that the underlying techniques
significantly increase Harvey's effectiveness in achieving high coverage and
detecting vulnerabilities, in most cases orders-of-magnitude faster; they also
reveal new insights about contract code.

regulation. For instance, in the medical domain, there are various statues at
the state and federal level that dictate who is permitted to work with
patients' records and under what conditions. To screen for potential privacy
breaches, logging systems are usually deployed to trigger alerts whenever
suspicious access is detected. However, such mechanisms are often inefficient
because 1) the vast majority of triggered alerts are false positives, 2) small
budgets make it unlikely that a real attack will be detected, and 3) attackers
can behave strategically, such that traditional auditing mechanisms cannot
easily catch them. To improve efficiency, information systems may invoke
signaling, so that whenever a suspicious access request occurs, the system can,
in real time, warn the user that the access may be audited. Then, at the close
of a finite period, a selected subset of suspicious accesses are audited. This
gives rise to an online problem in which one needs to determine 1) whether a
warning should be triggered and 2) the likelihood that the data request event
will be audited. In this paper, we formalize this auditing problem as a
Signaling Audit Game (SAG), in which we model the interactions between an
auditor and an attacker in the context of signaling and the usability cost is
represented as a factor of the auditor's payoff. We study the properties of its
Stackelberg equilibria and develop a scalable approach to compute its solution.
We show that a strategic presentation of warnings adds value in that SAGs
realize significantly higher utility for the auditor than systems without
signaling. We illustrate the value of the proposed auditing model and the
consistency of its advantages over existing baseline methods.

and effectively preserves the graph structure. Recently, a significant amount
of progress has been made toward this emerging research area. However, there
are several fundamental problems that remain open. First, existing methods fail
to preserve the out-degree distributions on directed graphs. Second, many
existing methods employ random walk based proximities and thus suffer from
conflicting optimization goals on undirected graphs. Finally, existing
factorization methods are unable to achieve scalability and non-linearity
simultaneously.
  This paper presents an in-depth study on graph embedding techniques on both
directed and undirected graphs. We analyze the fundamental reasons that lead to
the distortion of out-degree distributions and to the conflicting optimization
goals. We propose {\em transpose proximity}, a unified approach that solves
both problems. Based on the concept of transpose proximity, we design \strap, a
factorization based graph embedding algorithm that achieves scalability and
non-linearity simultaneously. \strap makes use of the {\em backward push}
algorithm to efficiently compute the sparse {\em Personalized PageRank (PPR)}
as its transpose proximities. By imposing the sparsity constraint, we are able
to apply non-linear operations to the proximity matrix and perform efficient
matrix factorization to derive the embedding vectors. Finally, we present an
extensive experimental study that evaluates the effectiveness of various graph
embedding algorithms, and we show that \strap outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in terms of effectiveness and scalability.

assume that the fluid motion is governed by the Stokes-Brinkmann equations. We
make an internal measurement and then have a least-square approach to locate
the obstacle. The idea is to rewrite the reconstruction problem as a topology
optimization problem. The existence and the stability of the optimization
problem are demonstrated. We use here the concept of the topological gradient
in order to determine the obstacle and it's rough location. The topological

The permeability field inside the reservoir is parametrised with an

parametrised with the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This novel combination
of techniques from machine learning, sparsity regularisation, seismic imaging

machine learning technique is proposed to enable large-scale nodes, e.g.,
mobile devices, to distributedly train and globally share models without
revealing their local data. This technique can not only significantly improve
privacy protection for mobile devices, but also ensure good performance of the
trained results collectively. Currently, most the existing studies focus on
optimizing federated learning algorithms to improve model training performance.
However, incentive mechanisms to motivate the mobile devices to join model
training have been largely overlooked. The mobile devices suffer from
considerable overhead in terms of computation and communication during the
federated model training process. Without well-designed incentive,
self-interested mobile devices will be unwilling to join federated learning
tasks, which hinders the adoption of federated learning. To bridge this gap, in
this paper, we adopt the contract theory to design an effective incentive
mechanism for simulating the mobile devices with high-quality (i.e.,
high-accuracy) data to participate in federated learning. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is efficient for federated learning
with improved learning accuracy.

suitable for distributed privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms, is

traffic flow in a city, using a DLT-type architecture and without perturbing
the density, with the idea of realizing a set of virtual tokens as surrogates

emulate the probing actions of commanded (real) vehicles on a given planned

trajectory. Consequently, the environment stays unaffected (i.e., the autonomy
of participating vehicles is not influenced by the algorithm), regardless of

presented, and numerical results from large-scale simulations are provided to

radical content online is crucial to limit the reach and spread of the
extremist narrative. In this paper, our aim is to identify measures to
automatically detect radical content in social media. We identify several
signals, including textual, psychological and behavioural, that together allow
for the classification of radical messages. Our contribution is three-fold: (1)
we analyze propaganda material published by extremist groups and create a
contextual text-based model of radical content, (2) we build a model of
psychological properties inferred from these material, and (3) we evaluate
these models on Twitter to determine the extent to which it is possible to
automatically identify online radical tweets. Our results show that radical
users do exhibit distinguishable textual, psychological, and behavioural
properties. We find that the psychological properties are among the most
distinguishing features. Additionally, our results show that textual models
using vector embedding features significantly improves the detection over
TF-IDF features. We validate our approach on two experiments achieving high

notable feature is a set of rewriting rules that are used to replace every
symbol in a string in parallel; by repeating this process, a sequence of
strings is produced. Some symbols in the strings may be interpreted as
instructions for simulation software. Thus, the sequence can be used to model
the steps of a process. Currently, creating an L-system for a specific process
is done by hand by experts through much effort. The inductive inference problem
attempts to infer an L-system from such a sequence of strings generated by an
unknown system; this can be thought of as an intermediate step to inferring
from a sequence of images. This paper evaluates and analyzes different genetic
algorithm encoding schemes and mathematical properties for the L-system
inductive inference problem. A new tool, the Plant Model Inference Tool for
Context-Free L-systems (PMIT-D0L) is implemented based on these techniques.
PMIT-D0L has been successfully evaluated on 28 known L-systems, with alphabets
