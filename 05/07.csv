and experimentally, are quantum spin liquid (QSL) states, in which no
long-range magnetic ordering appears at low temperatures due to strong quantum
fluctuations of the magnetic moments. The existing QSL candidates all have
their intrinsic disadvantages, however, and solid evidence for quantum
fluctuations is scarce. Here we report a new compound,
Na$_{2}$BaCo(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$, a geometrically frustrated system with effective
spin-1/2 local moments for Co$^{2+}$ ions on an isotropic two-dimensional
triangular lattice. Magnetic susceptibility and neutron scattering experiments
show no magnetic ordering down to 0.05 K. Thermodynamic measurements show that
there is a tremendous amount of magnetic entropy present below 1 K in zero
applied magnetic field. The presence of localized low-energy spin fluctuations
is revealed by inelastic neutron measurements. At low applied fields, these
spin excitations are confined to low energy and contribute to the anomalously
large specific heat. In larger applied fields, the system reverts to normal
behavior as evident by both neutron and thermodynamic results. Our experimental
characterization thus reveals that this new material is an excellent candidate
for the experimental realization of a quantum spin liquid state.

Yet, to achieve cost efficiency, it is crucial to identify a deployment
configuration that satisfies user-defined QoS constraints (e.g., on execution
time), while avoiding unnecessary over-provisioning. This paper introduces
Lynceus, a new approach for the optimization of cloud based data analytic jobs
that improves overstate-of-the-art approaches by enabling significant cost
savings both in terms of the final recommended configuration and of the
optimization process used to recommend configurations. Unlike existing
solutions, Lynceus optimizes in a joint fashion both the cloud-related and the
application-level parameters. This allows for a reduction of the cost of
recommended configurations by up to 3.7x at the 90-th percentile with respect
to existing approaches, which treat the optimization of cloud-related and
application-level parameters as two independent problems. Further, Lynceus
reduces the cost of the optimization process (i.e., the cloud cost incurred for
testing configurations) by up to 11x. Such an improvement is achieved thanks to
two mechanisms: i) a timeout approach which allows to abort the exploration of
configurations that are deemed suboptimal, while still extracting useful
information to guide future explorations and to improve its predictive model -
differently from recent works, which either incur the full cost for testing
suboptimal configurations or are unable to extract any knowledge from aborted
runs; ii) a long-sighted and budget-aware technique that determines which
configurations to test by predicting the long-term impact of each exploration -
unlike state-of-the-art approaches for the optimization of cloud jobs, which
adopt greedy optimization methods.

stellar age, which is particularly pertinent for the blue supergiant phase.
Stellar oscillations represent a unique method of probing stellar interiors,
yet inference for blue supergiants is hampered by a dearth of observed
pulsation modes. Here we report the detection of diverse variability in blue
supergiants using the K2 and TESS space missions. The discovery of pulsation
modes or an entire spectrum of low-frequency gravity waves in these stars allow
us to map the evolution of hot massive stars towards the ends of their lives.
Future asteroseismic modelling will provide constraints on ages, core masses,
interior mixing, rotation and angular momentum transport. The discovery of
variability in blue supergiants is a step towards a data-driven empirical
calibration of theoretical evolution models for the most massive stars in the

properties. Since the coupling constant is relevant in $d<4$ dimensions, the RG
is entirely governed by renormalization scheme-dependent terms. We show that
the known proofs of the Borel summability of observables depend on the
renormalization scheme and apply only in ""minimal"" ones, equivalent in $d=2$ to
an operatorial normal ordering prescription, where the $\beta$-function is
trivial to all orders in perturbation theory. The presence of a non-trivial

observable, like the mass gap, with no need of RG techniques. Focusing on the
$N=1$, $d=2$ $\phi^4$ theory, we define a one-parameter family of
renormalization schemes where Borel summability is guaranteed and study the
accuracy on the determination of the critical exponent $\nu$ as the scheme is
varied. While the critical coupling shows a significant sensitivity on the

where jobs have precedence constraints. We are interested in the demanding
setting where the jobs sizes are not known up-front, but are revealed only upon
completion (the non-clairvoyant setting). Such precedence-constrained
scheduling problems routinely arise in map-reduce and large-scale optimization.
In this paper, we make progress on this problem. For the objective of total
weighted completion time, we give a constant-competitive algorithm. And for
total weighted flow-time, we give an $O(1/\epsilon^2)$-competitive algorithm
under $(1+\epsilon)$-speed augmentation and a natural ``no-surprises''
assumption on release dates of jobs (which we show is necessary in this
context).
  Our algorithm proceeds by assigning {\em virtual rates} to all the waiting
jobs, including the ones which are dependent on other uncompleted jobs, and
then use these virtual rates to decide on the actual rates of minimal jobs
(i.e., jobs which do not have dependencies and hence are eligible to run).
Interestingly, the virtual rates are obtained by allocating time in a fair
manner, using a Eisenberg-Gale-type convex program (which we can also solve
optimally using a primal-dual scheme). The optimality condition of this convex
program allows us to show dual-fitting proofs more easily, without having to
guess and hand-craft the duals. We feel that this idea of using fair virtual
rates should have broader applicability in scheduling problems.

high fidelity when the timescale of the control is smaller than the duration of
the wave packets. Dynamically coupled cavities can be used to avoid limitations
in the photon-photon interaction time set by the delay-bandwidth product of
passive cavities. Additionally, they enable the elimination of wave packet
distortions caused by dispersive cavity transmission and reflection. We
consider three kinds of nonlinearities, those arising from
$\chi^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ and $\chi^{\scriptscriptstyle(3)}$ materials and
that due to an interaction with a two-level emitter. To analyze the input and

suggest that dynamically coupled cavities provide a very useful tool for
improving the performance of quantum devices relying on cavity-enhanced

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which must build Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs) even for syntactically invalid programs in order to offer features
such as automated refactoring and code completion.
  Parsing Expressions Grammars (PEGs) are a formalism that naturally describes
recursive top-down parsers using a restricted form of backtracking. Labeled
failures are a conservative extension of PEGs that adds an error reporting
mechanism for PEG parsers, and these labels can also be associated with
recovery expressions to provide an error recovery mechanism. These expressions
can use the full expressivity of PEGs to recover from syntactic errors.
  Manually annotating a large grammar with labels and recovery expressions can
be difficult. In this work, we present two approaches, Standard and Unique, to
automatically annotate a PEG with labels, and to build their corresponding
recovery expressions. The Standard approach annotates a grammar in a way
similar to manual annotation, but it may insert labels incorrectly, while the
Unique approach is more conservative to annotate a grammar and does not insert
labels incorrectly.
  We evaluate both approaches by using them to generate error recovering
parsers for four programming languages: Titan, C, Pascal and Java. In our
evaluation, the parsers produced using the Standard approach, after a manual
intervention to remove the labels incorrectly added, gave an acceptable
recovery for at least 70% of the files in each language. By it turn, the
acceptable recovery rate of the parsers produced via the Unique approach,
without the need of manual intervention, ranged from 41% to 76%.

allow Parsl to construct a dynamic dependency graph of components that it can
then execute efficiently on one or many processors. Parsl is designed for
scalability, with an extensible set of executors tailored to different use

show, via experiments on the Blue Waters supercomputer, that Parsl executors
can allow Python scripts to execute components with as little as 5 ms of

end-to-end training is desired. In this paper, we propose a novel simple
approach to CNN+CRF combination. In particular, we propose to simulate a CRF
regularizer with a trainable module that has standard CNN architecture. We call
this module a CRF Simulator. We can automatically generate an unlimited amount
of ground truth for training such CRF Simulator without any user interaction,
provided we have an efficient algorithm for optimization of the actual CRF
regularizer. After our CRF Simulator is trained, it can be directly
incorporated as part of any larger CNN architecture, enabling a seamless
end-to-end training. In particular, the other modules can learn parameters that
are more attuned to the performance of the CRF Simulator module. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on the task of salient object segmentation
regularized with the standard binary CRF energy. In contrast to previous work
we do not need to develop and implement the complex mechanics of optimizing a
specific CRF as part of CNN. In fact, our approach can be easily extended to
other CRF energies, including multi-label. To the best of our knowledge we are
the first to study the question of whether the output of CNNs can have
regularization properties of CRFs.

{\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 250602 (2008)] has been widely used
in the recent years to assess the properties of two-dimensional quantum
systems, working directly in the thermodynamic limit. This formalism, which is
based upon a tensor-network representation of the ground-state wave function,
has several appealing features, e.g., encoding the so-called area law of
entanglement entropy by construction; still, the method presents critical
issues when dealing with the optimization of tensors, in order to find the best
possible approximation to the exact ground state of a given Hamiltonian. Here,
we discuss the obstacles that arise in the optimization by imaginary-time
evolution within the so-called simple and full updates and connect them to the
emergence of a sharp multiplet structure in the ""virtual"" indices of tensors.
In this case, a generic choice of the bond dimension $D$ is not compatible with
the multiplets and leads to a symmetry breaking (e.g., generating a finite
magnetic order). In addition, varying the initial guess, different final states
may be reached, with very large deviations in the magnetization value. In order
to exemplify this behavior, we show the results of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model
on an array of coupled ladders, for which a vanishing magnetization below the
critical interladder coupling is recovered only for selected values of $D$,
while a blind optimization with a generic $D$ gives rise to a finite
magnetization down to the limit of decoupled ladders.

analyse \textit{Swift}/UVOT near-UV (NUV) images and SDSS/MaNGA emission-line

kiloparsec-sized star forming regions within the galaxies and compare their
optical nebular attenuation (i.e., the Balmer emission line optical depth,
$\tau^l_B\equiv\tau_{\textrm{H}\beta}-\tau_{\textrm{H}\alpha}$) and NUV stellar
continuum attenuation (via the NUV power-law index, $\beta$) to the attenuation
law described by Battisti et al. The data agree with that model, albeit with
significant scatter. We explore the dependence of the scatter of the
$\beta$-$\tau^l_B$ measurements from the star forming regions on different
physical parameters, including distance from the nucleus, star formation rate

find a strong variation in $\beta$ between the kiloparsec scale and the larger

apply unsupervised segmentation to take advantage of the elementary structure

continuous-variable quantum systems are subjected to fundamental limitations,
as it is known that general resources cannot be distilled within the Gaussian
paradigm. We show that these limitations can be overcome by considering a
collaborative setting where one party increases the amount of local resource
with the aid of another party, whose operations are assumed to be Gaussian but
are otherwise unrestricted; the two parties can only communicate classically.
We show that in single-shot scenarios, unlike in the well-known case of
entanglement theory, two-way classical communication does not lead to any
improvement over one-way classical communication from the aiding party to the
aided party. We then provide a concise general expression for the Gaussian
resource of assistance, i.e., the maximum amount of resource that can be
obtained when the aiding party holds a purification of the aided party's state,
as measured by a general monotone. To demonstrate its usefulness, we apply our
result to two important kinds of resources, squeezing and entanglement, and
find some simple analytic solutions. In the case of entanglement theory, we are
able to find general upper bounds on the regularized Gaussian entanglement of
assistance, and to establish additivity for tensor powers of thermal states.
This allows us to draw a quantitative and enlightening comparison with the
performance of assisted entanglement distillation in the non-Gaussian setting.
On the technical side, we develop some variational expressions to handle
functions of symplectic eigenvalues that may be of independent interest. Our
results suggest further potential for Gaussian operations to play a major role
in practical quantum information processing protocols.

white dwarfs changes throughout their evolution, a process known as spectral
evolution. Because of the ambiguity of their atmospheric compositions and the
difficulties inherent to the modeling of their dense atmospheres, no consensus
exists regarding the spectral evolution of cool white dwarfs ($T_{\rm
eff}<6000$ K). In the previous papers of this series, we presented and
observationally validated a new generation of cool white dwarf atmosphere
models that include all the necessary constitutive physics to accurately model
those objects. Using these new models and a homogeneous sample of 501 cool
white dwarfs, we revisit the spectral evolution of cool white dwarfs. Our
sample includes all spectroscopically identified white dwarfs cooler than 8300
K for which a parallax is available in Gaia DR2 and photometric observations
are available in Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS. Except for a few cool carbon-polluted
objects, our models allow an excellent fit to the spectroscopic and photometric
observations of all objects included in our sample. We identify a decrease of
the ratio of hydrogen to helium-rich objects between 7500 K and 6250 K, which
we interpret as the signature of convective mixing. After this decrease,
hydrogen-rich objects become more abundant up to 5000 K. This puzzling
increase, reminiscent of the non-DA gap, has yet to be explained. At lower
temperatures, below 5000 K, hydrogen-rich white dwarfs become rarer, which
rules out the scenario according to which accretion of hydrogen from the
interstellar medium dominates the spectral evolution of cool white dwarfs.

Incorporating the virtual cell concept enables the utilization of more

a cooperative decoding scheme in which the base-stations in each virtual cell

adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged recently as a powerful framework for
this problem. In particular, label-conditional extensions (e.g., StarGAN) have
become a promising solution owing to their ability to address this problem

Lightweight and fast to compute. CARAFE introduces little computational

multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), composed of a single pair of Weyl nodes of

both the continuum and lattice models, we show that a mWSM with $n>1$ can be
constructed by placing $n$ flavors of linearly dispersing simple Weyl fermions
(with $n=1$) in a bath of an $SU(2)$ non-Abelian static background gauge field.
Such an $SU(2)$ field preserves certain crystalline symmetry (four-fold
rotational or $C_4$ in our construction), but breaks the Lorentz symmetry,
resulting in nonlinear band spectra (namely, $E \sim (p^2_x + p^2_y)^{n/2}$,
but $E \sim |p_z|$, for example, where momenta ${\bf p}$ is measured from the
Weyl nodes). Consequently, the effective field theory displays $U(1) \times
SU(2)$ non-Abelian anomaly, yielding anomalous Hall effect, its non-Abelian
generalization, and various chiral conductivities. The anomalous violation of
conservation laws is determined by the monopole charge $n$ and a specific
algebraic property of the $SU(2)$ Lie group, which we further substantiate by
numerically computing the regular and ""isospin"" densities from the lattice
models of mWSMs. These predictions are also supported from a strongly coupled
(holographic) description of mWSMs. Altogether our findings unify the field
theoretic descriptions of mWSMs of arbitrary monopole charge $n$ (featuring $n$
copies of the Fermi arc surface states), predict signatures of non-Abelian
anomaly in table-top experiments, and pave the route to explore anomaly
structures for multi-fold fermions, transforming under arbitrary half-integer

$n$-point Virasoro conformal blocks in $c>1$ two-dimensional conformal field
theories with no chiral primaries, using fusion matrix approach. These CFTs
include not only holographic CFTs dual to classical gravity, but also their
full quantum corrections, since this approach allows us to explore full $1/c$
corrections. As the important applications, we study time dependence of Renyi
entropy after a local quench and out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) at late
time.
  We first show that, the $n$-th ($n>2$) Renyi entropy after a local quench in
our CFT grows logarithmically at late time, for any $c$ and any conformal
dimensions of excited primary. In particular, we find that this behavior is
independent of $c$, contrary to the expectation that the finite $c$ correction
fixes the late time Renyi entropy to be constant. We also show that the
constant part of the late time Renyi entropy is given by a monodromy matrix.
  We also investigate OTOCs by using the monodromy matrix. We first rewrite the
monodromy matrix in terms of fusion matrix explicitly. By this expression, we
find that the OTOC decays exponentially in time, and the decay rates are
divided into three patterns, depending on the dimensions of external operators.
We note that our result is valid for any $c>1$ and any external operator
dimensions. Our monodromy matrix approach can be generalized to the Liouville
theory and we show that the Liouville OTOC approaches constant in the late time
regime.
  We emphasize that, there is a number of other applications of the fusion and
the monodromy matrix approaches, such as solving the conformal bootstrap
equation. Therefore, it is tempting to believe that the fusion and monodromy
matrix approaches provide a key to understanding the AdS/CFT correspondence.

quantum Hall phenomena. Here, we consider topologically nontrivial physics from
a distinct origin, where the cyclotron orbits take nontrivial knotting

with a slab geometry, where the Fermi arcs on the opposing surfaces can cross
without interfering with each other and form a knot together with the bulk Weyl
nodes, and in an external magnetic field, the resulting chiral Landau levels.
We provide a microscopic lattice model to realize a cyclotron orbit with an
unconventional geometry of a trefoil knot and study the corresponding quantum
oscillations. Interestingly, unlike the conventional ring-shaped cyclotron
orbit, a trefoil knot is self-threading, allowing the magnetic field line along
the cyclotron orbit to contribute to the overall Berry phase and therefore
altering the external magnetic field for each quantization level. The cyclotron
orbit knot offers an arena of the nontrivial knot theory in three spatial
dimensions and its subsequent physical consequences.

how spectral features correlate with various SN properties. These composite
spectra reproduce known correlations with phase, light-curve shape, and
host-galaxy morphology. With our large dataset, we are also able to generate
fine-grained composite spectra simultaneously over both phase and light-curve
shape. The color evolution of our composite spectra is consistent with other SN
Ia template spectra, and the spectral properties of our composite spectra are
in rough agreement with these template spectra with some subtle differences. We
investigate the spectral differences of SNe Ia that occur in galaxies with
varying morphologies. Controlling for light-curve shape, which is highly
correlated with host-galaxy morphology, we find that SNe Ia residing in

appear to have Ca II near-infrared triplet features that have slightly
different strengths. Although this is apparent in the composite spectra and
there is some difference in the populations as seen by individual spectra, this

$h^3$ Mpc$^{-3}$ placed either in massive halos or randomly. On scales of
$10-30$ $h^{-1} \mbox{ Mpc}$, the flux 3PCF displays hierarchical scaling with
the square of the 2PCF, but with an unusual value of $Q \equiv
\zeta_{123}/(\xi_{12} \xi_{13} + \xi_{12} \xi_{23} + \xi_{13} \xi_{23}) \approx
-4.5$ that reflects the low bias of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and the

a novel test of the conventional paradigm of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and help
separate the contributions of UVB fluctuations and density fluctuations to
Ly$\alpha$ forest clustering.

are the widest and deepest of IC 1613 to date. We measure surface density
profiles of young main-sequence, intermediate to old red giant branch, and
ancient horizontal branch stars outside of 12' ($\sim 2.6$ kpc; 2.5 half-light
radii) from the IC 1613 center. All of the populations extend to ~24' ($\sim
5.2$ kpc; 5 half-light radii), with the older populations best fit by a broken
exponential in these outer regions. Comparison with earlier studies sensitive
to IC 1613's inner regions shows that the density of old stellar populations
steepens substantially with distance from the center; we trace the $g$-band
effective surface brightness to an extremely faint limit of $\sim 33.7$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$. Conversely, the distribution of younger stars follows a single,
shallow exponential profile in the outer regions, demonstrating different
formation channels for the younger and older components of IC 1613. The
outermost, intermediate-age and old stars have properties consistent with those
expected for accreted stellar halos, though future observational and

10^9\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=0.7$. The origins of stellar particles are classified
according to their birthplace (in situ or ex situ) and their orbits at birth.
Before disk settling, stars form mainly through chaotic mergers between
proto-galaxies and become part of the spheroidal component. When disk settling
starts, we find that more massive galaxies begin to form disk stars from
earlier epochs; massive galaxies commence to develop their disks at $z\sim1-2$,
while low-mass galaxies do after $z\sim1$. The formation of disks is affected
by accretion as well, as mergers can trigger gas turbulence or induce
misaligned gas infall that prevents galaxies from forming co-rotating disk
stars. The importance of accreted stars is greater in more massive galaxies,
especially in developing massive spheroids. A significant fraction of the
spheroids comes from the disk stars that are perturbed, which becomes more
important at lower redshifts. Some ($\sim12.5\%$) of our massive galaxies
develop counter-rotating disks from the gas infall misaligned with the existing
disk plane, which can last for more than a Gyr until they become the dominant
component, and flip the angular momentum of the galaxy in the opposite
direction. The final disk-to-total ratio of a galaxy needs to be understood in
relation to its stellar mass and accretion history. We quantify the
significance of the stars with different origins and provide them as guiding
values.

determined by the time evolution of the maximum cluster mass, which depends on
the galactic environment and largely increases with the gas pressure. Different
metallicity subpopulations of stars, clusters and GCs present overlapping
formation histories, implying that star and cluster formation represent
continuous processes. The metal-poor GCs ($-2.5<[\rm Fe/H]<-1.5$) of our
galaxies are older than the metal-rich GC subpopulation ($-1.0<[\rm

increasing metallicity, which suggests different GC metallicity subpopulations
do not form independently and their spatial and kinematic distributions are the
result of their evolution in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation and
evolution. We predict that proto-GC formation is most prevalent at $2\lesssim z

despite substantial progress in recent years. It was experimentally shown that
in certain specific conditions, getting path information in a multi-path

it was argued that in multi-path interference experiments, visibility of
interference and 'which-path' information are not always complementary
observables. In the present work, a new wave-particle duality relation is
presented, based on a sum of visibilities of interference from individual pairs
of path. This relation is always respected, even in the kind of specific
situations mentioned above. This sum of visibilities turns out to be related to
a recently introduced measure of coherence. As one of the consequences, it
provides a novel way of experimentally measuring coherence in a multi-path
interference experiment. As another consequence, this relation suggests a
simple way of measuring path-distinguishability in multi-path interference. In
addition, it resolves several outstanding issues concerning wave-particle

H-stripped SN 2016coi (a.k.a. ASASSN-16fp), spanning the $\gamma$-ray through
optical and radio wavelengths, acquired within the first hours to $\sim$420
days post explosion. Our campaign confirms the identification of He in the SN
ejecta, which we interpret to be caused by a larger mixing of Ni into the outer
ejecta layers. From the modeling of the broad bolometric light curve we derive
a large ejecta mass to kinetic energy ratio ($M_{\rm{ej}}\sim
4-7\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$, $E_{\rm{k}}\sim 7-8\times 10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$). The small
[\ion{Ca}{ii}] \lam\lam7291,7324 to [\ion{O}{i}] \lam\lam6300,6364 ratio
($\sim$0.2) observed in our late-time optical spectra is suggestive of a large
progenitor core mass at the time of collapse. We find that SN 2016coi is a
luminous source of X-rays ($L_{X}>10^{39}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the first
$\sim100$ days post explosion) and radio emission ($L_{8.5\,GHz}\sim7\times
10^{27}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}Hz^{-1}}$ at peak). These values are in line with those
of relativistic SNe (2009bb, 2012ap). However, for SN 2016coi we infer
substantial pre-explosion progenitor mass-loss with rate $\dot M \sim
(1-2)\times 10^{-4}\,\rm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and a sub-relativistic shock
velocity $v_{sh}\sim0.15c$, in stark contrast with relativistic SNe and similar
to normal SNe. Finally, we find no evidence for a SN-associated shock breakout
$\gamma$-ray pulse with energy $E_{\gamma}>2\times 10^{46}\,\rm{erg}$. While we
cannot exclude the presence of a companion in a binary system, taken together,
our findings are consistent with a massive single star progenitor that
experienced large mass loss in the years leading up to core-collapse, but was
unable to achieve complete stripping of its outer layers before explosion.

the self-adaptation. A SAS often operates in dynamic and partially unknown
environments, which cause uncertainty that the SAS has to address to achieve
its goals. Moreover, besides the environment, other classes of uncertainty have
been identified. However, these various classes and their sources are not
systematically addressed by current approaches throughout the life cycle of the
SAS. In general, uncertainty typically makes the assurance provision of SAS
goals exclusively at design time not viable. This calls for an assurance
process that spans the whole life cycle of the SAS. In this work, we propose a
goal-oriented assurance process that supports taming different sources (within
different classes) of uncertainty from defining the goals at design time to
performing self-adaptation at runtime. Based on a goal model augmented with
uncertainty annotations, we automatically generate parametric symbolic formulae
with parameterized uncertainties at design time using symbolic model checking.
These formulae and the goal model guide the synthesis of adaptation policies by
engineers. At runtime, the generated formulae are evaluated to resolve the
uncertainty and to steer the self-adaptation using the policies. In this paper,
we focus on reliability and cost properties, for which we evaluate our approach
on the Body Sensor Network (BSN) implemented in OpenDaVINCI. The results of the
validation are promising and show that our approach is able to systematically
tame multiple classes of uncertainty, and that it is effective and efficient in
providing assurances for the goals of self-adaptive systems.

application of parallel DC electric and magnetic fields creates an imbalance in
the number of carriers of opposite topological charge (chirality). Here, using
time-resolved terahertz measurements on the Weyl semimetal TaAs in a magnetic

to find the most informative trajectories by maximizing an
information-theoretic metric, such as the mutual information between the map
and potential future measurements. Unfortunately, most existing
information-based exploration algorithms are plagued by the computational
difficulty of evaluating the Shannon mutual information metric. In this paper,
we consider the fundamental problem of evaluating Shannon mutual information
between the map and a range measurement. First, we consider 2D environments. We
propose a novel algorithm, called the Fast Shannon Mutual Information (FSMI).
The key insight behind the algorithm is that a certain integral can be computed
analytically, leading to substantial computational savings. Second, we consider
3D environments, represented by efficient data structures, e.g., an OctoMap,
such that the measurements are compressed by Run-Length Encoding (RLE). We
propose a novel algorithm, called FSMI-RLE, that efficiently evaluates the
Shannon mutual information when the measurements are compressed using RLE. For
both the FSMI and the FSMI-RLE, we also propose variants that make different
assumptions on the sensor noise distribution for the purpose of further
computational savings. We evaluate the proposed algorithms in extensive
experiments. In particular, we show that the proposed algorithms outperform
existing algorithms that compute Shannon mutual information as well as other
algorithms that compute the Cauchy-Schwarz Quadratic mutual information
(CSQMI). In addition, we demonstrate the computation of Shannon mutual
information on a 3D map for the first time.

particular hardware architecture; at the same time, they make it easier to
generate optimized code for a multitude of platforms as the transformation has
to be encoded only once. Here, we describe a new code generation framework
(NMODL) for an existing DSL in the NEURON framework, a widely used software for
massively parallel simulation of biophysically detailed brain tissue models.
Existing NMODL DSL transpilers lack either essential features to generate
optimized code or capability to parse the diversity of existing models in the

previously published user models and offers high-level domain-specific
optimizations and symbolic algebraic simplifications before target code
generation. Furthermore, rich analysis tools are provided allowing the
scientist to introspect models. NMODL implements multiple SIMD and SPMD targets
optimized for modern hardware. Benchmarks were performed on Intel Skylake,
Intel KNL and AMD Naples platforms. When comparing NMODL-generated kernels with
NEURON we observe a speedup of up to 20x, resulting into overall speedups of
two different production simulations by $\sim$10x. When compared to a
previously published SIMD optimized version that heavily relied on
auto-vectorization by the compiler still a speedup of up to $\sim$2x is

disfavoured as a dark matter portal by direct searches and the observations on

that role. We explore this possibility in the context of two Higgs doublet
models (2HDM). Taking Type I and Type II 2HDM as illustration, and assuming a
scalar gauge singlet dark matter particle, we show that the heavy neutral
CP-even scalar ($H$) can (a) serve as dark matter portal consistently with all
data, and (b) have a substantial invisible branching ratio, over a wide region
of the parameter space. Using this fact, we estimate rates of LHC signals where
$H$ is produced via ({\it i}) gluon fusion, in association with a hard jet, and
({\it ii}) vector boson fusion. Invisible decays of the $H$ can then lead to
monojet + $\slashed{E_T}$ in ({\it i}), and two forward jets with large
rapidity gap + $\slashed{E_T}$ in ({\it ii}). The second kind of signal usually
yields better significance for the high-luminosity run. We also supplement our
cut-based analyses with those based on gradient boosted decision trees

significance distinctly improves, especially for Type II 2HDM.

  Experience Report","Accepted at IST journal",,"10.1016/j.infsof.2019.05.002",,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Context: Specification mining techniques are typically used to extract the
specification of a software in the absence of (up-to-date) specification
documents. This is useful for program comprehension, testing, and anomaly
detection. However, specification mining can also potentially be used for
debugging, where a faulty behavior is abstracted to give developers a context
about the bug and help them locating it. Objective: In this project, we
investigate this idea in an industrial setting. We propose a very basic
semi-automated specification mining approach for debugging and apply that on
real reported issues from an AutoPilot software system from our industry
partner, MicroPilot Inc. The objective is to assess the feasibility and
usefulness of the approach in a real-world setting. Method: The approach is
developed as a prototype tool, working on C code, which accept a set of
relevant state fields and functions, per issue, and generates an extended
finite state machine that represents the faulty behavior, abstracted with
respect to the relevant context (the selected fields and functions). Results:
We qualitatively evaluate the approach by a set of interviews (including
observational studies) with the company's developers on their real-world
reported bugs. The results show that a) our approach is feasible, b) it can be
automated to some extent, and c) brings advantages over only using their
code-level debugging tools. We also compared this approach with traditional
fully automated state-merging algorithms and reported several issues when
applying those techniques on a real-world debugging context. Conclusion: The
main conclusion of this study is that the idea of an ""interactive""
specification mining rather than a fully automated mining tool is NOT
impractical and indeed is useful for the debugging use case.

routing, modulation and spectrum assignment (RMSA) in elastic optical networks

policies with deep neural networks (DNNs) that can sense complex EON states.
The DNNs are trained with experiences of dynamic lightpath provisioning. We
first modify the asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm and present an
episode-based training mechanism for DeepRMSA, namely, DeepRMSA-EP. DeepRMSA-EP
divides the dynamic provisioning process into multiple episodes (each
containing the servicing of a fixed number of lightpath requests) and performs
training by the end of each episode. The optimization target of DeepRMSA-EP at
each step of servicing a request is to maximize the cumulative reward within
the rest of the episode. Thus, we obviate the need for estimating the rewards
related to unknown future states. To overcome the instability issue in the
training of DeepRMSA-EP due to the oscillations of cumulative rewards, we
further propose a window-based flexible training mechanism, i.e., DeepRMSA-FLX.
DeepRMSA-FLX attempts to smooth out the oscillations by defining the
optimization scope at each step as a sliding window, and ensuring that the
cumulative rewards always include rewards from a fixed number of requests.
Evaluations with the two sample topologies show that DeepRMSA-FLX can
effectively stabilize the training while achieving blocking probability
reductions of more than 20.3% and 14.3%, when compared with the baselines.

To address this issue, wireless steganography hides covert information inside
primary information by slightly modifying the transmitted waveform such that
primary information will still be decodable, while covert information will be
seen as noise by agnostic receivers. Since the addition of covert information
inevitably decreases the SNR of the primary transmission, key challenges in
wireless steganography are: i) to assess the impact of the covert channel on
the primary channel as a function of different channel conditions; and ii) to
make sure that the covert channel is undetectable. Existing approaches are
protocol-specific, also we notice that existing wireless technologies rely on
phase-keying modulations that in most cases do not use the channel up to its
Shannon capacity. Therefore, the residual capacity can be leveraged to
implement a wireless system based on a pseudo-noise asymmetric shift keying
(PN-ASK) modulation, where covert symbols are mapped by shifting the amplitude
of primary symbols. This way, covert information will be undetectable, since a
receiver expecting phase-modulated symbols will see their shift in amplitude as
an effect of channel/path loss degradation. We first investigate the SER of
PN-ASK as a function of the channel; then, we find the optimal PN-ASK
parameters that optimize primary and covert throughput under different channel
condition. We evaluate the throughput performance and undetectability of PN-ASK
through extensive simulations and on an experimental testbed based on USRP N210
software-defined radios. We show that PN-ASK improves the throughput by more
than 8x with respect to prior art. Finally, we demonstrate through experiments
that PN-ASK is able to transmit covert data on top of IEEE 802.11g frames,

controllability and open-loop-response characteristics with respect to those
exhibited by state-of-the-art two-winged microrobots with the same size and
similar weight (i.e., the 75-mg Harvard RoboBee). The key innovation that made
possible the development of Bee$^+$ is the introduction of an extremely light
(28-mg) pair of twinned unimorph actuators, which enabled the design of a new
microrobotic mechanism that flaps four wings independently. A first main
advantage of the proposed design, compared to those of two-winged flyers, is
that by increasing the number of actuators from two to four, the number of
direct control inputs increases from three to four when simple sinusoidal
excitations are employed. A second advantage of Bee$^+$ is that its four-wing
configuration and flapping mode naturally damp the rotational disturbances that
commonly affect the yaw degree of freedom of two-winged microrobots. In
addition, the proposed design greatly reduces the complexity of the associated
fabrication process compared to those of other microrobots, as the unimorph
actuators are fairly easy to build. Lastly, we hypothesize that given the
relatively low wing-loading affecting their flapping mechanisms, the life
expectancy of Bee$^+$s must be considerably higher than those of the two-winged
counterparts. The functionality and basic capabilities of the robot are
demonstrated through a set of simple control experiments.

conditional dependency structure of large sets of random variables from sparse

produces a clique forest and an associated Markov Random Field (MRF) by
generalising Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, the MFCF presents three elements of novelty with respect to existing
structure learning approaches. The first is the repeated application of a local
topological move, the clique expansion, that preserves the decomposability of
the underlying graph. Through this move the decomposability and calculation of
scores is performed incrementally at the variable (rather than edge) level, and
this provides better computational performance and an intuitive application of
multivariate statistical tests. The second is the capability to accommodate a
variety of score functions and, while this paper is focused on multivariate
normal distributions, it can be directly generalised to different types of
statistics. Finally, the third is the variable range of allowed clique sizes
which is an adjustable topological constraint that acts as a topological
penalizer providing a way to tackle sparsity at $l_0$ semi-norm level; this
allows a clean decoupling of structure learning and parameter estimation. The
MFCF produces a representation of the clique forest, together with a perfect
ordering of the cliques and a perfect elimination ordering for the vertices. As
an example we propose an application to covariance selection models and we show
that the MCFC outperforms the Graphical Lasso for a number of classes of
matrices.

lifted multiplicity codes with length $N$ and redundancy $O(t^{0.585}

long-wavelength (super-CMB) modes are strongly coupled to short-wavelength

additional freedom in the theoretical CMB angular power spectrum and can lead
to different inferred values of the standard cosmological parameters relative

how the six standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters shift when two additional

highlight the possibility that equal-size binaries formed in the disk but were
subsequently removed by impacts and/or dynamical effects (e.g., scattering
encounters with Neptune). We determine the dependence of these processes on the
size and separation of binary components. Our results indicate that tighter
binaries, if they formed in the massive disk, have relatively good chances of
survival (unless the disk was long-lived). In contrast, the widest binaries in
the hot population, such as 2002 VF130, have a very low survival probability
(<1%) even if the massive disk was short-lived. They may represent a trace of
lucky survivors of a much larger population of the original disk binaries, or
they formed at ~30-40~au and dodged the impact- and encounter-related
perturbations that we studied here. We find that all known satellites of the

The many-body localization threshold is characterized by the critical

By using a real-time FRB detection system, we captured raw voltages for five of
the six events, which allowed for coherent dedispersion and very high time
resolution (10.24 $\mu$s) studies of the bursts. Five of the FRBs show temporal
broadening consistent with interstellar and/or intergalactic scattering, with
scattering timescales ranging from 0.16 to 29.1 ms. One burst, FRB181017, shows
remarkable temporal structure, with 3 peaks each separated by 1 ms. We searched
for phase-coherence between the leading and trailing peaks and found none,
ruling out lensing scenarios. Based on this survey, we calculate an all-sky
rate at 843 MHz of $98^{+59}_{-39}$ events sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ to a fluence
limit of 8 Jy-ms: a factor of 7 below the rates estimated from the Parkes and
ASKAP telescopes at 1.4 GHz assuming the ASKAP-derived spectral index
$\alpha=-1.6$ ($F_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha}$). Our results suggest that FRB
spectra may turn over below 1 GHz. Optical, radio and X-ray followup has been
made for most of the reported bursts, with no associated transients found. No
repeat bursts were found in the survey.

conformal field theory is the organization of their Hilbert space into Verma
modules, whereby all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are obtained by the
repeated action of Virasoro lowering operators onto a finite set of
highest-weight states. The usual representation-theoretic approach to removing
from all modules zero-norm descendant states generated in such a way is based
on the assumption that those states form a nested sequence of Verma submodules
built upon singular vectors, i.e., descendant highest-weight states. We show
that this fundamental assumption breaks down for the Ramond-sector Verma module
with highest weight $c/24$ in the even series of $\mathcal{N}\!=\!1$
superconformal minimal models with central charge $c$. To resolve this impasse,
we conjecture, and prove at low orders, the existence of a nested sequence of
linear-dependence relations that enables us to compute the character of the
irreducible $c/24$ module. Based on this character formula, we argue that
imposing modular invariance of the torus partition function requires the
introduction of a non-null odd-parity Ramond-sector ground state. This
symmetrization of the ground-state manifold allows us to uncover a set of
conformally invariant boundary conditions not previously discussed and absent
in the odd series of superconformal minimal models, and to derive for the first

total length $N$, which was recently proposed to model a set of similar
sequences. The ED string matching (EDSM) problem is to find all occurrences of
a pattern of length $m$ in an ED text. An $O(nm^{1.5}\sqrt{\log m}+N)$-time
algorithm for EDSM is known [Aoyama et al., CPM 2018]. The standard assumption
in the prior work on this question is that $N$ is substantially larger than
both $n$ and $m$, and thus we would like to have a linear dependency on the
former. Under this assumption, the natural open problem is whether we can
decrease the 1.5 exponent in the time complexity, similarly as in the related
(but, to the best of our knowledge, not equivalent) word break problem [Backurs
and Indyk, FOCS 2016].
  Our starting point is a conditional lower bound for EDSM. We use the popular
combinatorial Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) conjecture stating that there
is no truly subcubic combinatorial algorithm for BMM [Abboud and Williams, FOCS
2014]. By designing an appropriate reduction we show that a combinatorial
algorithm solving the EDSM problem in $O(nm^{1.5-e}+N)$ time, for any $e>0$,
refutes this conjecture. Our reduction should be understood as an indication
that decreasing the exponent requires fast matrix multiplication.
  String periodicity and fast Fourier transform are two standard tools in
string algorithms. Our main technical contribution is that we successfully
combine these tools with fast matrix multiplication to design a
non-combinatorial $\tilde{O}(nm^{\omega-1}+N)$-time algorithm for EDSM, where
$\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication exponent. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to combine these tools. In particular, using the
fact that $\omega<2.373$ [Le Gall, ISSAC 2014; Williams, STOC 2012], we obtain
an $O(nm^{1.373}+N)$-time algorithm for EDSM.

second order methods, formally predicting step sizes required to satisfy
specified local truncation error $\sigma$ in the limit of small order parameter
$\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ during meta-stable dynamics. The formal predictions
are made under stability assumptions that include the preservation of the
asymptotic structure of the diffuse interface, a concept we call profile
fidelity. In this setting, definite statements about the relative behaviour of
time stepping methods can be made. Some methods, including all so-called energy
stable methods but also some fully implicit methods, require asymptotically
more time steps than others.The formal analysis is confirmed in computational
studies. We observe that some provably energy stable methods popular in the
literature perform worse than some more standard schemes. We show further that
when Backward Euler is applied to meta-stable Allen Cahn dynamics, the energy
decay and profile fidelity properties for these discretizations are preserved
for much larger time steps than previous analysis would suggest. The results
are established asymptotically for general interfaces, with a rigorous proof
for radial interfaces. It is shown analytically and computationally that for
most reaction terms, Eyre type time stepping performs asymptotically worse due
to loss of profile fidelity.

downside is that the spherical shell is subdivided into two equally sized,

order finite differences on the Marker-And-Cell (MAC) stencil. The entire
scheme is implemented in parallel using a domain decomposition iteration, and a
direction splitting approach for the local solves. The stability, accuracy and
weak scalability of the method is verified on a manufactured solution of the

Z-MgONRs exhibit two kinds of exchange interaction with extremely different
natures. The magnetism in O-edge is strongly localized with ferromagnetic order
while the magnetism in Mg-edge is itinerant with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida

  (NOMA)",,,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) allows multiple users to share a
time-frequency resource block by using different power levels. An important
challenge associated with NOMA is the selection of users that share a resource
block. This is referred to as clustering, which generally exploits the channel
disparity (i.e. distinctness) among the users. We discuss clustering and the
related resource allocation challenges (e.g. power allocation) associated with
NOMA and highlight open problems that require further investigation. We review
the related literature on exploiting channel disparity for clustering and
resource allocation. There have been several misconceptions regarding NOMA
clustering including: 1) clustering users with low channel disparity is
detrimental, 2) similar power allocation is disastrous for NOMA. We clarify
such misunderstandings with numerical examples.

mainly consist of two possible origins: synchrotron (nonthermal) and
photosphere (thermal). The typical spectral properties of GRBs can be modeled
by a dominant nonthermal component (a Band-like function or cutoff power law),
while some of them have an additional thermal component (a Planck-like
function). In this paper, we investigate the effects of thermal components on
the nonthermal spectral parameters. We focus on eight {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor bursts of which the spectra deviate from a Band-only function,
and the thermal components are significant. We sort them into
thermal-subdominant Group I (e.g. GRB 110721A) and thermal-dominant Group II
(e.g., GRB 090902B). Several interesting results are found assuming the
spectral component is totally attributed to the nonthermal component: (i) the
low-energy photon index $\alpha$ becomes harder; (ii) the peak energy $E_{\rm
c}$ is significantly smaller and lies between the peak temperature of blackbody
component and the peak energy of the cutoff power law + blackbody (CPL+BB)
model; (iii) total flux $F$, is generally the same; (iv) the changes ($\Delta
\alpha$ and $\Delta E_{\rm c}$) are positively correlated with the ratio
between the thermal flux and total flux; and (v) parameter relations
($F-\alpha$, $F-E_{\rm c}$ and $E_{\rm c}$-$\alpha$) also changed prominently.
The GRBs in both groups show the same results. Our analysis indicates that the
thermal component is important, and it significantly affects the spectral
parameters and the consequential physical interpretations.

thresholds. Due to practical constraints, it is not known if there exists an
obvious choice for a decoder. In this paper, we introduce a framework which can
combine arbitrary decoders for any given code to significantly reduce the
logical error rates. We rely on the crucial observation that two different
decoding techniques, while possibly having similar logical error rates, can
perform differently on the same error syndrome. We use machine learning
techniques to assign a given error syndrome to the decoder which is likely to
decode it correctly. We apply our framework to an ensemble of Minimum-Weight

show an improvement of 38.4%, 14.6%, and 7.1% over the pseudo-threshold of MWPM

counterpart of the Fourier scaling exponents observed in the atmosphere, where
in the latter case the earth rotation is relevant. The turbulent statistics
observed here for nearly zero Reynolds number flow is favor to be interpreted
by the geostrophic turbulence theory. Moreover, the intermittency correction is
recognized with an intensity to be close to the one of the hydrodynamic
turbulence of high Reynolds number turbulent flows, implying a universal
scaling feature of very different turbulent flows. Our results not only shed

\cite{LNW14,AHLW16}, is that any turnstile streaming algorithm can be
implemented as a linear sketch (the reverse is trivially true). We study the
relationship between turnstile streaming and linear sketching algorithms in
more detail, giving both new separations and new equivalences between the two
models.
  It was shown in \cite{LNW14} that, if a turnstile algorithm works for
arbitrarily long streams with arbitrarily large coordinates at intermediate
stages of the stream, then the turnstile algorithm is equivalent to a linear
sketch. We show separations of the opposite form: if either the stream length
or the maximum value of the stream are substantially restricted, there exist
problems where linear sketching is exponentially harder than turnstile
streaming.
  A further limitation of the \cite{LNW14} equivalence is that the turnstile
sketching algorithm is neither explicit nor uniform, but requires an
exponentially long advice string. We show how to remove this limitation for
deterministic streaming algorithms: we give an explicit small-space algorithm
that takes the streaming algorithm and computes an equivalent module.

labelled data is difficult or expensive to acquire. Deep generative models
(e.g., Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) and semisupervised Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) have recently shown promising performance in semi-supervised
classification for the excellent discriminative representing ability. However,
the latent code learned by the traditional VAE is not exclusive (repeatable)
for a specific input sample, which prevents it from excellent classification
performance. In particular, the learned latent representation depends on a
non-exclusive component which is stochastically sampled from the prior
distribution. Moreover, the semi-supervised GAN models generate data from
pre-defined distribution (e.g., Gaussian noises) which is independent of the
input data distribution and may obstruct the convergence and is difficult to
control the distribution of the generated data. To address the aforementioned
issues, we propose a novel Adversarial Variational Embedding (AVAE) framework
for robust and effective semi-supervised learning to leverage both the
advantage of GAN as a high quality generative model and VAE as a posterior
distribution learner. The proposed approach first produces an exclusive latent
code by the model which we call VAE++, and meanwhile, provides a meaningful
prior distribution for the generator of GAN. The proposed approach is evaluated
over four different real-world applications and we show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models, which confirms that the combination of
VAE++ and GAN can provide significant improvements in semisupervised

induces large bias in tasks with high action dimensions, and bias from clipping
makes it difficult to reuse old samples with large IS weights. In this paper,
we consider PPO, a representative on-policy algorithm, and propose its
improvement by dimension-wise IS weight clipping which separately clips the IS
weight of each action dimension to avoid large bias and adaptively controls the
IS weight to bound policy update from the current policy. This new technique
enables efficient learning for high action-dimensional tasks and reusing of old

these three visual features are mapped to the first integer variable (v1) and
length to the second quantitative variable (v2). Participants performed two
tasks within 20 seconds: (1) MAX: find the largest v2 when v1 is fixed; (2)
SEARCH: find a specific bivariate variable shown on the screen in a vector
field. Our first study with eighteen participants performing these tasks showed
that the randomized vector positions, although they lessened viewers' ability
to group vectors, did not reduce task accuracy compared to structured vector
fields. This result may support that these color, texture, and length can
provide to a certain degree, guide viewers' attention to task-relevant regions.
The second study measured eye movement to quantify viewers' behaviors with
three-errors (scanning, recognition, and decision errors) and one-behavior
(refixation) metrics. Our results showed two dominant search strategies:
drilling and scanning. Coloring tended to restrict eye movement to the
task-relevant regions of interest, enabling drilling. Length tended to support
scanners who quickly wandered around at different v1 levels. Drillers had
significantly less errors than scanners and the error rates for color and
texture were also lowest. And length had limited discrimination power than
color and texture as a 3D visual guidance. Our experiment results may suggest
that using categorical visual feature could help obtain the global structure of
a vector field visualization. We provide the first benchmark of the attention
cost of seeing a bivariate vector on average about 5 items per second.

restoration schemes usually require the reconstruction for the covariance of
downlink process noise vector, which is dependent on DL channel covariance
matrix (CCM). However, the acquisition of the CCM leads to unacceptable
overhead in massive MIMO systems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we
propose a novel scheme for the DL channel tracking. First, with the help of
virtual channel representation (VCR), we build a dynamic uplink (UL) massive
MIMO channel model with the consideration of off-grid refinement. Then, a
coordinate-wise maximization based expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is
adopted for capturing the model parameters, including the spatial signatures,
the time-correlation factors, the off-grid bias, the channel power, and the
noise power. Thanks to the angle reciprocity, the spatial signatures,
timecorrelation factors and off-grid bias of the DL channel model can be
reconstructed with the knowledge of UL ones. However, the other two kinds of
model parameters are closely related with the carrier frequency, which cannot
be perfectly inferred from the UL ones. Instead of relearning the DL model
parameters with dedicated training, we resort to the optimal Bayesian Kalman
filter (OBKF) method to accurately track the DL channel with the partially
prior knowledge. At the same time, the model parameters will be gradually
restored. Specially, the factor-graph and the Metropolis Hastings MCMC are
utilized within the OBKF framework. Finally, numerical results are provided to
demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed scheme.

heavily rely on parallel processing or distributed computing, which trade
higher power consumption for higher performance. In this paper we propose

exercising individual control over the amplitude and phase of numerous
diffracted modes, in both reflection and transmission. Lately, these periodic
arrangements of subwavelength polarizable particles (meta-atoms) were shown to
deflect an incoming plane wave to prescribed angles with very high
efficiencies, despite their sparsity with respect to conventional metasurfaces.
Nonetheless, most reported MGs were designed based on full-wave optimization of
the meta-atoms, with the scarce analytical schemes leading directly to
realizable devices were restricted to single-layer reflecting structures,
controlling only the partition of power. In this paper, we present an
analytical model for plane-wave interaction with a general multilayered
multielement MG, composed of an arbitrary number of meta-atoms distributed
across an arbitrary number of layers in a given stratified media configuration.
For a desired (forward and backward) diffraction pattern, we formulate suitable
constraints, identify the required number of degrees of freedom, and
correspondingly set them to yield a detailed MG configuration implementing the
prescribed functionality; no full-wave optimization is involved. To verify and
demonstrate the versatility of this systematic approach, fabrication-ready
multilayer PCB MGs for perfect anomalous refraction and non-local focusing are
synthesized, fabricated, and experimentally characterized, for the first time

theoretical predictions. This appealing semianalytical methodology is expected
to accelerate the development of MGs and extend the relevant range of
applications, yielding practical MG designs on demand for arbitrary beam

besides spatial-variation, that enables better control over the guided wave in
a device. Periodically time-modulated structures which are usually considered
enable wave control over narrowband signals. However, for ultrawideband
short-pulse signals, time-variation in the form of temporal discontinuities is
required. Such a setup has recently been proposed as a mean to overcome the
Bode-Fano bound on impedance matching. While hard (abrupt) temporal
discontinuities are relatively simple to analyze by employing continuity of
magnetic flux and electric charge, soft (gradual) temporal switching of the
guiding structure parameters is more challenging. This work explores the case
of a short-pulse dynamics in a one-dimensional, metamaterial TL, medium with
general smooth time-variation of its parameters. In this time-varying TL,
wave-field solutions are obtained by a WKB approach which is more common in the
context of gradual spatial variations. Using this methodology a leading order
transmitted and reflected waves due to the time-variation are derived, followed
by a discussion of the energy balance in such switched media. A canonical
example of capacitor discharge into a long time-varied TL is given. These
results may be used as analysis/synthesis tools for time-varying wave devices

a challenge during the analysis of the acquired volumes as they substantially
obfuscate the location of tissue interfaces. To deal with the artifacts and
speckle noise patterns and accurately segment the shallowest tissue interface,
we propose a cascaded neural network framework, which comprises of a
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and a Tissue Interface
Segmentation Network (TISN). The cGAN pre-segments OCT B-scans by removing
undesired specular artifacts and speckle noise patterns just above the

the pre-segmentation to segment the shallowest interface. We show the
applicability of the cascaded framework to corneal datasets, demonstrate that

generalization capacity to limbal datasets. We also propose a hybrid framework,

function zeros have for many years been considered a purely theoretical

extract the critical exponents of the Ising model in two and three dimensions

formalization of data privacy in the past decade. This privacy definition and
its divergence based relaxations, however, have several acknowledged
weaknesses, either in handling composition of private algorithms or in
analyzing important primitives like privacy amplification by subsampling.
Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of privacy, this paper proposes
a new relaxation, which we term `$f$-differential privacy' ($f$-DP). This
notion of privacy has a number of appealing properties and, in particular,
avoids difficulties associated with divergence based relaxations. First, $f$-DP
preserves the hypothesis testing interpretation. In addition, $f$-DP allows for
lossless reasoning about composition in an algebraic fashion. Moreover, we
provide a powerful technique to import existing results proven for original DP
to $f$-DP and, as an application, obtain a simple subsampling theorem for
$f$-DP.
  In addition to the above findings, we introduce a canonical single-parameter
family of privacy notions within the $f$-DP class that is referred to as
`Gaussian differential privacy' (GDP), defined based on testing two shifted
Gaussians. GDP is focal among the $f$-DP class because of a central limit
theorem we prove. More precisely, the privacy guarantees of \emph{any}
hypothesis testing based definition of privacy (including original DP)
converges to GDP in the limit under composition. The CLT also yields a
computationally inexpensive tool for analyzing the exact composition of private
algorithms.
  Taken together, this collection of attractive properties render $f$-DP a
mathematically coherent, analytically tractable, and versatile framework for
private data analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the tools we develop
by giving an improved privacy analysis of noisy stochastic gradient descent.

ammonia depletion always occurs in the center of the core. In particular, our

association reactions on the grain surface can result in the immediate
desorption of the product molecule, leads to ammonia abundances that are over
an order of magnitude above the observed level in the innermost 15000 au of the
core - at least when one employs a constant efficiency for the chemical
desorption process irrespective of the ice composition. Our results seemingly
constrain the chemical desorption efficiency of ammonia on water ice to below
1%. It is increasingly evident that time-dependent effects must be considered
so that the results of chemical models can be reconciled with observations.

technique for the reduction of required ground motions in the dynamic time
history analysis. In this non-stationary spectral matching approach,
unconstrained optimization is employed to adjust the signal to match a target
spectrum. Adjustment factors of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients
associated with the signals are then considered as decision variables and the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is employed to find the optimum values of DWT
coefficients. This matching algorithm turns out to be quite effective in the
spectral matching objective, where matching at multiple damping ratios can be
readily achieved. First, the efficiency of the spectral matching procedure is
investigated in a case study earthquake record and then compared with two
conventional spectral matching methods. Results show considerable improvement
in the matching accuracy which is accompanied by minimal changes in shaking
characteristics of the original signal. In addition, it is shown that
earthquake records matched with the proposed method can noticeably reduce the
essential number of ground motions that are normally required for the dynamic
analysis of a case study model. In this regard, it has been found that we can
reduce the number of required motions by more than 80% when matched motions are
selected to be used as the seismic inputs for the dynamic analysis.

vehicles using messages transmitted over the network protocols. The controller
is designed to be responsible for micro-managing every vehicle in the platoon

X-ray, and ultraviolet observations of the outflow-driving symbiotic star MWC
560 (=V694 Mon) during its 2016 optical high state. We tracked multi-wavelength
changes that signalled an abrupt increase in outflow power at the initiation of
a months-long outflow fast state, just as the optical flux peaked: (1) an
abrupt doubling of Balmer absorption velocities; (2) the onset of a $20$
$\mu$Jy/month increase in radio flux; and (3) an order-of-magnitude increase in
soft X-ray flux. Juxtaposing to prior X-ray observations and their coeval
optical spectra, we infer that both high-velocity and low-velocity optical
outflow components must be simultaneously present to yield a large soft X-ray
flux, which may originate in shocks where these fast and slow absorbers
collide. Our optical and ultraviolet spectra indicate that the broad
absorption-line gas was fast, stable, and dense ($\gtrsim10^{6.5}$ cm$^{-3}$)
throughout the 2016 outflow fast state, steadily feeding a lower-density
($\lesssim10^{5.5}$ cm$^{-3}$) region of radio-emitting gas. Persistent optical
and ultraviolet flickering indicate that the accretion disc remained intact.
The stability of these properties in 2016 contrasts to their instability during
MWC 560's 1990 outburst, even though the disc reached a similar accretion rate.
We propose that the self-regulatory effect of a steady fast outflow from the

behaviour in a symbiotic binary resembles disc/outflow relationships governing
accretion state changes in X-ray binaries.

that the multiplier method, which is a generalization of Noether's theorem, has
significant advantages in comparison with the embedding method, which uses
adjoint-symmetry/symmetry pairs and is based on embedding the original system
of DEs in a larger one that follows from a Lagrangian. In particular, the
multiplier method can generally give a wider range of conserved currents than
the embedding method. In this paper simple extended forms of general systems of
DEs, obtained by treating parameters present in the equations or introduced
into them as dependent variables, are studied. A variant of a fundamental
result on the connection between the embedding method and the action of
symmetries on conserved currents that correspond to a multiplier is derived for
the extended systems of DEs. Using this connection and by considering
particular extensions that endow the extended DEs with scaling symmetry, it is
shown that the embedding method becomes significantly stronger if it is also
allowed to be applied to the extended forms of the original DEs. It is also
shown that up to equivalence the multipliers of an extended DE system contain
the parametric multipliers of the original system together with the derivatives
of the corresponding conserved currents with respect to the parameters.

functions for the different integral terms, which are related to the source
term and to initial data. We will start with the one dimensional case (in
space). We point out that we may not apply in a straightforward way Duhamel's
principle to deal with the source term since the coefficients of lower order
terms make our model not invariant by time translation. On the contrary, we
shall begin with the representation formula for the inhomogeneous equation with
vanishing data by using a revised Duhamel's principle. Then, we will derive the
representation of the solution in the homogeneous case with nontrivial data.
After deriving the formula in the one dimensional case, the classical approach

information on line-of-sight magnetic fields, including contributions from our
Galaxy, source environments, and the intergalactic medium (IGM). Looking at
differences in RMs, $\Delta$RM, between adjacent sources on the sky can help
isolate these different components. In this work, we classify adjacent
polarized sources in the NVSS as random or physical pairs. We recompute and
correct the uncertainties in the NVSS RM catalog, since these were
significantly overestimated. Our sample contains 317 physical and 5111 random
pairs, all with Galactic latitudes $|b|\ge20^{\circ}$, polarization fractions
$\ge2\%$, and angular separations between $1.^{'},$ and $20^{'}$. We find an
rms $\Delta$RM of $14.9\pm0.4\,$rad m$^{-2}$ and $4.6\pm1.1\,$rad m$^{-2}$ for
random and physical pairs, respectively. This means polarized extragalactic
sources that are close on the sky, but at different redshifts, have larger
differences in RM than two components of one source. This difference of
$\sim10\,$rad m$^{-2}$ is significant at $5\sigma$, and persists in different
data subsamples. While there have been other statistical studies of $\Delta$RM
between adjacent polarized sources, this is the first unambiguous demonstration
that some of this RM difference must be extragalactic, thereby providing a firm
upper limit on the RM contribution of the IGM. If the $\Delta$RMs originate
local to the sources, then the local magnetic field difference between random
sources is a factor of two larger than between components of one source.
Alternatively, attributing the difference in $\Delta$RMs to the intervening IGM
yields an upper limit on the IGM magnetic field strength of $40\,$nG.

potential and a linear temperature dependent dissipative coefficient. We
derived the evolution equation of all kinds of perturbations without assuming
slow-roll approximation, and obtained the curvature power spectrum at the end
of inflation with a fully numerical method. Then we compute the scalar spectral
index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ for several representative potentials,
and compare our results with observational data. At last, we use Planck data to
constrain the parameters in our models. This work is a natural extension of
single-field warm inflation, and the aim of this work is to present some
features of multi-field warm inflation using a simple two-field model.

radio transients and Fast radio bursts' (SMIRF), performed using the newly
refurbished UTMOST telescope. SMIRF repeatedly sweeps the southern Galactic
plane performing real-time periodicity and single-pulse searches, and is the
first survey of its kind carried out with an interferometer. SMIRF is
facilitated by a robotic scheduler which is capable of fully autonomous
commensal operations. We report on the SMIRF observational parameters, the data
analysis methods, the survey's sensitivities to pulsars, techniques to mitigate
radio frequency interference and present some early survey results. UTMOST's
wide field of view permits a full sweep of the Galactic plane to be performed
every fortnight, two orders of magnitude faster than previous surveys. In the
six months of operations from January to June 2018, we have performed $\sim 10$
sweeps of the Galactic plane with SMIRF. Notable blind re-detections include
the magnetar PSR J1622$-$4950, the RRAT PSR J0941$-$3942 and the eclipsing
pulsar PSR J1748$-$2446A. We also report the discovery of a new pulsar, PSR
J1705$-$54. Our follow-up of this pulsar with the UTMOST and Parkes telescopes
at an average flux limit of $\leq 20$ mJy and $\leq 0.16$ mJy respectively,
categorizes this as an intermittent pulsar with a high nulling fraction of $<
0.002$

Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) boundary conditions only for sufficiently large length
$L$ and undergoes a phase transition from the phase of partly broken gauge
symmetry ($U(1)$) to the symmetric phase ($U(1)\times U(1)$) for large $L$. On
the other hand, the Grassmannian model has a detached phase with one massive
and one massless non-zero condensates that completely break $U(2)$ gauge
symmetry. This phase lives on a region of $L$ bounded from above and has to use
the Robin boundary conditions. We also examine the L-dependence of the total
energy and detect the linear growth inherent to confining string in all phases.

models. Despite their successes, the most appropriate choice of a GAN network
architecture is still not well understood. GAN models for image synthesis have
adopted a deep convolutional network architecture, which eliminates or
minimizes the use of fully connected and pooling layers in favor of convolution
layers in the generator and discriminator of GANs. In this paper, we
demonstrate that a convolution network architecture utilizing deep fully
connected layers and pooling layers can be more effective than the traditional
convolution-only architecture, and we propose FCC-GAN, a fully connected and
convolutional GAN architecture. Models based on our FCC-GAN architecture learn
both faster than the conventional architecture and also generate higher quality
of samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our approach
across four popular image datasets.

  Spatio-Temporal Networks","Accepted by BMVC2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies demonstrated that the average heart rate (HR) can be measured
from facial videos based on non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG).
However for many medical applications (e.g., atrial fibrillation (AF)
detection) knowing only the average HR is not sufficient, and measuring precise
rPPG signals from face for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is needed.
Here we propose an rPPG measurement method, which is the first work to use deep
spatio-temporal networks for reconstructing precise rPPG signals from raw
facial videos. With the constraint of trend-consistency with ground truth pulse
curves, our method is able to recover rPPG signals with accurate pulse peaks.
Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, and results
demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance on both HR and HRV
levels comparing to the state-of-the-art methods. We also achieve promising
results of using reconstructed rPPG signals for AF detection and emotion
recognition.

complex, high-level visual tasks has led to rising expectations for their
potential to match the human visual system. However, DNNs exhibit
idiosyncrasies that suggest their visual representation and processing might be
substantially different from human vision. One limitation of DNNs is that they
are vulnerable to adversarial examples, input images on which subtle, carefully
designed noises are added to fool a machine classifier. The robustness of the
human visual system against adversarial examples is potentially of great
importance as it could uncover a key mechanistic feature that machine vision is
yet to incorporate. In this study, we compare the visual representations of
white- and black-box adversarial examples in DNNs and humans by leveraging
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We find a small but significant
difference in representation patterns for different (i.e. white- versus black-
box) types of adversarial examples for both humans and DNNs. However, human
performance on categorical judgment is not degraded by noise regardless of the
type unlike DNN. These results suggest that adversarial examples may be
differentially represented in the human visual system, but unable to affect the
perceptual experience.

order features that have been observed in a variety of cuprates, especially in
the underdoped regime of the phase diagram. To explain the origin of the charge
order and its implication to the superconducting phase, many theoretical models
have been proposed, such as charge stripes, electronic nematicity, and Fermi
surface instability. A highly appealing physical picture is the so-called pair
density wave (PDW), a periodic modulation of Cooper paring in space, which may
also induce a charge order. To elucidate the existence and nature of the PDW
order, here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate a
severely underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}, in which superconductivity just
emerges on top of a pronounced checkerboard charge order. By analyzing the
spatial distribution of the spectral features characteristic of
superconductivity, we observe a periodic modulation of both the superconducting
coherence peak and gap depth, demonstrating the existence of a density wave
order of Cooper pairing. The PDW order has the same spatial periodicity as the

mantle growth results from gas molecules impinging on the dust from all

for deposition on ice photo-desorption rate has not been studied. This work
explores the impact on the accretion and photodesorption rates of the incidence
angle of CO gas molecules with the cold surface during deposition of a CO ice
layer. Infrared spectroscopy monitored CO ice upon deposition at different
angles, ultraviolet-irradiation, and subsequent warm-up. Vacuum-ultraviolet
spectroscopy and a Ni-mesh measured the emission of the ultraviolet lamp.
Molecules ejected from the ice to the gas during irradiation or warm-up were
characterized by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The photodesorption rate of CO
ice deposited at 11 K and different incident angles was rather stable between 0
and 45$^{\circ}$. A maximum in the CO photodesorption rate appeared around
70$^{\circ}$-incidence deposition angle. The same deposition angle leads to the
maximum surface area of water ice. Although this study of the surface area
could not be performed for CO ice, the similar angle dependence in the
photodesorption and the ice surface area suggests that they are closely
related. Further evidence for a dependence of CO ice morphology on deposition
angle is provided by thermal desorption of CO ice experiments.

The Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM) is a standard specified by the

is possible under the IC scenarios with very special conditions. In particular,
the FRB environment would need to invoke a neutron star with an extremely
strong magnetic field and an extremely fast spin, or an extremely young
supernova remnant (SNR) surrounding the FRB source. Furthermore, most electrons
in the source are also required to have a fine-tuned energy distribution such
that most of the IC energy is channeled in the optical band. We conclude that
the prospect of detecting FOBs associated with FRBs is low. On the other hand,
if FOBs are detected from a small fraction of FRBs, these FOBs would reveal
extreme physical conditions in the FRB environments.

generate different kinds of sparse representation of signals. To this end, we
apply a signal space greedy method, which relies on the ability to optimally

properties of tri-layer cuprate Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+x by using scanning tunneling

size exhibit periodic variations with the structural supermodulation, but the
effect is much more pronounced in the underdoped regime than at optimal doping.
Moreover, a new type of tunneling spectrum characterized by two superconducting
gaps emerges with increasing doping, and the two-gap features also correlate
with the supermodulation. We propose that the interaction between the

additional inclusion of gravitational interaction energy of astronomical
objects, whose masses are mostly inferred from gravitational effects and hence
should already contain all sources with long-range gravity forces. Ryskin
proposed that the backreaction contribution to the energy momentum tensor is
instead from the rest of the universe beyond the observable patch. Ryskin's
model elegantly solves the fine-tuning problem and is in good agreement with
the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae. In this article we revisit Ryskin's

cloud services based on description alone. An emerging alternative is to use a
decision support system (DSS), which typically relies on gaining insights from
observational data in order to assist a customer in making decisions regarding
optimal deployment or redeployment of cloud applications. The primary activity
of such systems is the generation of a prediction model (e.g. using machine
learning), which requires a significantly large amount of training data.
However, considering the varying architectures of applications, cloud
providers, and cloud offerings, this activity is not sustainable as it incurs
additional time and cost to collect training data and subsequently train the
models. We overcome this through developing a Transfer Learning (TL) approach
where the knowledge (in the form of the prediction model and associated data
set) gained from running an application on a particular cloud infrastructure is
transferred in order to substantially reduce the overhead of building new
models for the performance of new applications and/or cloud infrastructures. In

averaging over all possible tree-shaped (and therefore sparse) networks, in a
computationally efficient manner. An output of the procedure is the probability
for each edge to be part of the underlying network. A simulation study shows

Pseudomonas fluorescens in skimmed milk at 7, 13, 19, or 25 C was studied.
Bacterial interactions were modelled after applying a Bayesian approach. No

order (ODLRO) are associated with Bose-Einstein condensation. However, as in
the system of reduced dimension the effect of quantum fluctuation is
dominating, the concept of ODLRO becomes more interesting, especially for the
long-range interaction. In the present manuscript, we study the correlation
dynamics triggered by lattice depth quench in a system of three dipolar bosons
in a 1D triple-well optical lattice from the first principle using the
multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). Our
main motivation is to explore how ODLRO develops and decays with time when the
system is brought out-of-equilibrium by a sudden change in the lattice depth.
We compare results of dipolar bosons with contact interaction. For forward
quench $(V_{f} > V_{i})$, the system exhibits the collapse-revival dynamics in
the time evolution of normalized first- and second-order Glauber's correlation
function, time evolution of Shannon information entropy both for the contact as
well as for the dipolar interaction which is reminiscent of the one observed in
Greiner's experiment [Nature, {415}, (2002)]. We define the collapse and
revival time ratio as the figure of merit ($\tau$) which can uniquely
distinguish the timescale of dynamics for dipolar interaction from that of
contact interaction. In the reverse quench process $(V_{i} > V_{f})$, for
dipolar interaction, the dynamics is complex and the system does not exhibit
any definite time scale of evolution, whereas the system with contact
interaction exhibits collapse-revival dynamics with a definite time-scale. The
long-range repulsive tail in the dipolar interaction inhibits the spreading of
correlation across the lattice sites.

filament is rooted at the internetwork region at the base of the blowout jet.
The collective magnetic cancellation is observed by SDO/HMI line of sight (LOS)
magnetograms at the northern end of the filament, which makes this filament
unstable and further makes it to erupt in two different stages. In the first
stage, northern section of the filament is ejected, and causes an evolution of
the northern part of the blowout jet. This part of the blowout jet is further
extended as a collimated plasma beam to form a jet-like CME. We also observe
the plasma blobs at the northern edge of the blowout jet resulting from
Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability in its twisted magneto-plasma spire. In the
second stage, southern section of the filament erupts in form of
deformed/twisted magnetic flux rope which forms the southern part of the

face recognition networks. However, these losses always include sensitive
hyper-parameters which can make training process unstable, and it is very
tricky to set suitable hyper parameters for a specific dataset. This paper
addresses this challenge by directly designing the gradients for adaptively
training deep neural networks. We first investigate and unify previous cosine
softmax losses by analyzing their gradients. This unified view inspires us to
propose a novel gradient called P2SGrad (Probability-to-Similarity Gradient),
which leverages a cosine similarity instead of classification probability to
directly update the testing metrics for updating neural network parameters.
P2SGrad is adaptive and hyper-parameter free, which makes the training process
more efficient and faster. We evaluate our P2SGrad on three face recognition
benchmarks, LFW, MegaFace, and IJB-C. The results show that P2SGrad is stable
in training, robust to noise, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all
the three benchmarks.

turbulence and radiative feedback in a giant molecular cloud in the context of
fully-coupled radiation hydrodynamics (RHD). The physical relations of the LyC
escape with H I covering fraction, kinematics, spectral hardness, and the
emergent Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) line profiles are studied using a series
of RHD turbulence simulations performed with RAMSES-RT. The
turbulence-regulated mechanism allows ionizing photons to leak out at early
times before the onset of supernova feedback. The LyC photons escape through
turbulence-generated low column density channels which are evacuated
efficiently by radiative feedback via photoheating-induced shocks across the
D-type ionization fronts. Ly$\alpha$ photons funnel through the photoionized
channels along the paths of LyC escape, resulting in a diverse Ly$\alpha$
spectral morphology including narrow double-peaked profiles. The Ly$\alpha$
peak separation is controlled by the residual H I column density of the
channels and the line asymmetry correlates with the porosity and multiphase
structure of the H II region. This mechanism through the turbulent H II regions
can naturally reproduce the observed Ly$\alpha$ spectral characteristics of
some of LyC-leaking galaxies. This RHD turbulence-origin provides an appealing
hypothesis to explain high LyC leakage from very young ($\sim3$ Myr)
star-forming galaxies found in the local Universe without need of extreme
galactic outflows nor supernova feedback. We discuss the implications of the
turbulent H II regions on other nebular emission lines and a possible
observational test with the Magellanic System and local blue compact dwarf
galaxies as analogs of reionization-era systems.

component due to viscosity and an `inviscid' remainder. It is also attractive
to decompose the velocity field into irrotational and rotational parts, and
apportion the force resultants accordingly. The `irrotational' resultants can
then be identified as classical `added mass', but the remaining, `rotational',
resultants appear not to be consistent with the physical interpretation of the
rotational velocity field (as that arising from the fluid vorticity with the
body stationary). The alternative presented here splits the inviscid resultants
into components that are unquestionably due to independent aspects of the
problem: `convective' and `accelerative'. The former are associated with the
pressure field that would arise in an inviscid flow with (instantaneously) the
same velocities as the real one, and with the body's velocity parameters ---
angular and translational --- unchanging. The latter correspond to the pressure
generated when the body accelerates from rest in quiescent fluid with its given
rates of change of angular and translational velocity. They are reminiscent of
the added-mass force resultants, but are simpler, and closer to the standard
rigid-body inertia formulae, than the developed expressions for added-mass
force and moment. Finally, the force resultants due to viscosity also include a
contribution from pressure. Its presence is necessary in order to satisfy the
equations governing the pressure field, and it has previously been recognised
in the context of `excess' stagnation-point pressure. However, its existence
does not yet seem to be widely appreciated.

lots of storage space and energy. Compared with legacy DRAM, non-volatile
memories (NVMs) are suitable for bitmap storage due to the salient features in
capacity and power savings. However, NVMs suffer from higher latency and energy
consumption in writes compared with reads. Although compressing data in write
accesses to NVMs on-the-fly reduces the bit-writes in NVMs, existing precise or
approximate compression schemes show limited performance improvements for data
of bitmaps, due to the irregular data patterns and variance in data. We observe
that the data containing bitmaps show the pixel-level similarity due to the
analogous contents in adjacent pixels. By exploiting the pixel-level
similarity, we propose SimCom, an efficient similarity-aware compression scheme
in hardware layer, to compress data for each write access on-the-fly. The idea
behind SimCom is to compress continuous similar words into the pairs of base
words with runs. With the aid of domain knowledge of images, SimCom adaptively
selects an appropriate compression mode to achieve an efficient trade-off
between image quality and memory performance. We implement SimCom on GEM5 with
NVMain and evaluate the performance with real-world workloads. Our results
demonstrate that SimCom reduces 33.0%, 34.8% write latency and saves 28.3%,
29.0% energy than state-of-the-art FPC and BDI with minor quality loss of 3%.

label for hyperspectral pixels, has drawn great interest in recent years.
Although low rank representation (LRR) has been used to classify HSI, its
ability to segment each class from the whole HSI data has not been exploited
fully yet. LRR has a good capacity to capture the underlying lowdimensional
subspaces embedded in original data. However, there are still two drawbacks for
LRR. First, LRR does not consider the local geometric structure within data,
which makes the local correlation among neighboring data easily ignored.
Second, the representation obtained by solving LRR is not discriminative enough
to separate different data. In this paper, a novel locality and structure
regularized low rank representation (LSLRR) model is proposed for HSI
classification. To overcome the above limitations, we present locality
constraint criterion (LCC) and structure preserving strategy (SPS) to improve
the classical LRR. Specifically, we introduce a new distance metric, which
combines both spatial and spectral features, to explore the local similarity of
pixels. Thus, the global and local structures of HSI data can be exploited
sufficiently. Besides, we propose a structure constraint to make the
representation have a near block-diagonal structure. This helps to determine
the final classification labels directly. Extensive experiments have been
conducted on three popular HSI datasets. And the experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed LSLRR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

accelerators with collisions at arbitrarily high center-of-mass energies.
Recently, collisions of particles with spin around some rotating black holes
have been discussed. In this paper, we study the BSW mechanism for spinning
particles by using a metric ansatz which describes a general rotating black
hole. We notice that there are two inequivalent definitions of center-of-mass
(CM) energy for spinning particles. We mainly discuss the CM energy defined in
terms of the worldline of the particle. We show that there exists an
energy-angular momentum relation $e = \Omega_h j$ that causes collisions with
arbitrarily high energy near-extremal black holes. We also provide a simple but
rigorous proof that the BSW mechanism breaks down for nonextremal black holes.
For the alternative definition of the CM energy, some authors find a new
critical spin relation that also causes the divergence of the CM mass. However,
by checking the timelike constraint, we show that particles with this critical
spin cannot reach the horizon of the black hole. Further numerical calculation
suggests that such particles cannot exist anywhere outside the horizon. Our
results are universal, independent of the underlying theories of gravity.

Riemann-Hilbert problems technics that allow us to obtain explicit formulas for
the asymptotic solitons themselves that in contrast with the cited papers where
asymptotic formulas are obtained only for the square of absolute value of
solution. Using transformations of the main RH problems we arrive to a model
problem corresponding to the parametrix at the end points of continuous

effectively solved in terms of the generalized Laguerre polynomials which are
naturally appeared after appropriate scaling of the Riemann-Hilbert problem in
a small neighborhoods of the end points of continuous spectrum. Further
asymptotic analysis give an explicit formula for solitons at the edge of

quality and numerical algorithms. Methods have been designed that fundamentally
integrate high order isoparametric mappings with the other high accuracy
algorithms that are needed for divergence-free MHD simulations on geodesic
meshes. The goal of this paper is to document such algorithms that are
implemented in the geodesic mesh version of the RIEMANN code. The fluid
variables are reconstructed using a special kind of WENO-AO algorithm that
integrates the mesh geometry into the reconstruction process from the
ground-up. A novel divergence-free reconstruction strategy for the magnetic
field that performs efficiently at all orders, even on isoparametrically mapped
meshes, is then presented. The MHD equations are evolved in space and time
using a novel ADER predictor algorithm that is efficiently adapted to the
isoparametrically mapped geometry. The application of one-dimensional and
multidimensional Riemann solvers at suitable locations on the mesh then
provides the corrector step. The corrector step for the magnetic field uses a
Yee-type staggering of magnetic fields. This results in a scheme with
divergence-free update for the magnetic field. The use of ADER enables a
one-step update which only requires one messaging operation per complete
timestep. This is very beneficial for parallel processing. Several accuracy
tests are presented as are stringent test problems. PetaScale performance is
also demonstrated on the largest available supercomputers.

series isomorphism (Rosenbaum-Wagner, Theoret. Comp. Sci., 2015; Luks, 2015),
recursively-refineable filters (Wilson, J. Group Theory, 2013), and low-genus
GpI (Brooksbank-Maglione-Wilson, J. Algebra, 2017). Recursively-refineable
filters -- a generalization of subgroup series -- form the skeleton of this

Weisfeiler-Leman technique. Our technique is flexible enough to readily
incorporate additional hypergraph invariants or additional characteristic

low-mass vertexing and tracking systems with small cells, highly granular

path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method used since 1980s is based on the
formalism developed by R. P. Feynman. However, the huge computation time
required for the PIMD reduces its range of applicability. Another drawback is
the requirement of additional techniques to access time correlation functions
(ring polymer MD or centroid MD). We developed an alternative technique based
on a quantum thermal bath (QTB) which reduces the computation time by a factor
of ~20. The QTB approach consists in a classical Langevin dynamics in which the
white noise random force is replaced by a Gaussian random force having the
power spectral density given by the quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
The method has yielded satisfactory results for weakly anharmonic systems: the
quantum harmonic oscillator, the heat capacity of a MgO crystal, and isotope
effects in 7 LiH and 7 LiD. Unfortunately, the QTB is subject to the problem of
zero-point energy leakage (ZPEL) in highly anharmonic systems, which is
inherent in the use of classical mechanics. Indeed, a part of the energy of the
high-frequency modes is transferred to the low-frequency modes leading to a
wrong energy distribution. We have shown that in order to reduce or even
eliminate ZPEL, it is sufficient to increase the value of the frictional
coefficient. Another way to solve the ZPEL problem is to combine the QTB and
PIMD techniques. It requires the modification of the power spectral density of
the random force within the QTB. This combination can also be seen as a way to
speed up the PIMD.

  We propose a modular approach to structuring large scale codebases that

modules allows us to build many components independently, with only loose
coupling through a set of standardised signatures. Components can be
parameterized by other components and composed. Our approach accounts for

processing focuses on developing more sophisticated architectures to achieve
higher image quality. Little attention has been paid to the design of the
pipeline, and it is still not clear how significant the pipeline is to image
quality. In this work, we comprehensively study the effects of pipelines on the
mixture problem of learning-based DN, DM, and SR, in both sequential and joint
solutions. On the one hand, in sequential solutions, we find that the pipeline
has a non-trivial effect on the resulted image quality. Our suggested pipeline
DN$\to$SR$\to$DM yields consistently better performance than other sequential
pipelines in various experimental settings and benchmarks. On the other hand,
in joint solutions, we propose an end-to-end Trinity Pixel Enhancement NETwork

further present a novel and simple method that can integrate a certain pipeline
into a given end-to-end network by providing intermediate supervision using a

Our work indicates that the investigation of pipelines is applicable in

for educational evaluation of Iranian students. The current descriptive
evaluation method is based on four-valued logic. Assessing all students with
only four values is led to a lack of relative justice and the creation of
unrealistic equality. Also, the complexity of the evaluation process in the
current method increases teacher errors likelihood. As a suitable solution, in
this paper, a fuzzy descriptive evaluation system has been proposed. The
proposed method is based on fuzzy logic, which is an infinite-valued logic and
it can perform approximate reasoning on natural language propositions. By the
proposed fuzzy system, student assessment is performed over the school year
with infinite values instead of four values. But to eliminate the diversity of
assigned values to students, at the end of the school year, the calculated
values for each student will be rounded to the nearest value of the four
standard values of the current descriptive evaluation system. It can be
implemented easily in an appropriate smartphone app, which makes it much easier
for the teachers to evaluate the evaluation process. In this paper, the
evaluation process of the elementary third-grade mathematics course in Iran
during the period from the beginning of the MEHR (The Seventh month of Iran) to
the end of BAHMAN (The Eleventh Month of Iran) is examined by the proposed

main structural families identified as cages, planar polycyclic aromatics,

High abundances of CH$_4$ and H$_2$O in the atmosphere of Earth-like planets
around mid to late M dwarfs increase the detectability of the corresponding
spectral features compared to early M-dwarf planets. Increased temperatures in
the middle atmosphere of mid- to late-type M-dwarf planets expand the
atmosphere and further increase the detectability of absorption bands. To
detect CH$_4$, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$ in the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet
around a mid to late M dwarf observing only one transit with JWST could be
enough up to a distance of 4 pc and less than ten transits up to a distance of
10 pc. As a consequence of saturation limits of JWST and less pronounced
absorption bands, the detection of spectral features of hypothetical Earth-like
planets around most early M dwarfs would require more than ten transits. We
identify 276 existing M dwarfs (including GJ 1132, TRAPPIST-1, GJ 1214, and LHS
1140) around which atmospheric absorption features of hypothetical Earth-like

from two major drawbacks: 1) the inability to deal with indetermination in the
text, thus preventing the analysis of noisy time series; and 2) the inability
to deal with indetermination in the pattern, thus imposing the strict
satisfaction of the orders among all pattern positions. This paper provides the
first polynomial algorithm to answer the $\mu$OPPM problem when indetermination
is observed on the pattern or text. Given two strings with length $m$ and
$O(r)$ uncertain characters per string position, we show that the $\mu$OPPM
problem can be solved in $O(mr\lg r)$ time when one string is indeterminate and
$r\in\mathbb{N}^+$. Mappings into satisfiability problems are provided when
indetermination is observed on both the pattern and the text, and results
concerning the general problem complexity are presented as well, with $\mu$OPPM
problem proved to be NP-hard in general.

proposed where the architecture's structure is learned in an additional

promising as there are diverse problems and imaging modalities that require
architecture design. However, NAS is very time-consuming and medical learning
problems often involve high-dimensional data with high computational
requirements. We propose an efficient approach for NAS in the context of
medical, image-based deep learning problems by searching for architectures on
low-dimensional data which are subsequently transferred to high-dimensional
data. For OCT-based layer segmentation, we demonstrate that a search on 1D data
reduces search time by 87.5% compared to a search on 2D data while the final 2D

approximates all pairwise distances up to a factor of $t$. The {\em lightness}
of $H$ is defined as the ratio between the weight of $H$ to that of the minimum
spanning tree. An $(\alpha,\beta)$-{\em Shallow Light Tree} (SLT) is a tree of
lightness $\beta$, that approximates all distances from a designated root
vertex up to a factor of $\alpha$. A long line of works resulted in efficient
algorithms that produce (nearly) optimal light spanners and SLTs.
  Some of the most notable algorithmic applications of light spanners and SLTs
are in distributed settings. Surprisingly, so far there are no known efficient
distributed algorithms for constructing these objects in general graphs. In
this paper we devise efficient distributed algorithms in the CONGEST model for
constructing light spanners and SLTs, with near optimal parameters.
Specifically, for any $k\ge 1$ and $0<\epsilon<1$, we show a
$(2k-1)\cdot(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with lightness $O(k\cdot n^{1/k})$ can be
built in $\tilde{O}\left(n^{\frac12+\frac{1}{4k+2}}+D\right)$ rounds (where
$n=|V|$ and $D$ is the hop-diameter of $G$). In addition, for any $\alpha>1$ we
provide an $(\alpha,1+\frac{O(1)}{\alpha-1})$-SLT in $(\sqrt{n}+D)\cdot
n^{o(1)}$ rounds. The running time of our algorithms cannot be substantially
improved.
  We also consider spanners for the family of doubling graphs, and devise a
$(\sqrt{n}+D)\cdot n^{o(1)}$ rounds algorithm in the CONGEST model that
computes a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with lightness $(\log n)/\epsilon^{O(1)}$. As
a stepping stone, which is interesting in its own right, we first develop a
distributed algorithm for constructing nets (for arbitrary weighted graphs),
generalizing previous algorithms that worked only for unweighted graphs.

evolution processes. For short-period planets, the subJovian desert has been
discussed in recent years with regard to the planet population in the
mass/period and radius/period parameter space without taking stellar parameters
into account. The Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) is optimised for
detecting planets in this regime, which allows for further analysis of the
sub-Jovian desert.
  Aims: With high-precision photometric surveys (e.g. with NGTS and TESS),
which aim to detect short period planets especially around M/K-type host stars,
stellar parameters need to be accounted for when empirical data are compared to
model predictions. Presenting a newly discovered planet at the boundary of the
sub-Jovian desert, we analyse its bulk properties and use it to show the
properties of exoplanets that border the sub-Jovian desert.
  Methods: Using NGTS light curve and spectroscopic follow-up observations, we
confirm the planetary nature of planet NGTS-5b and determine its mass. Using
exoplanet archives, we set the planet in context with other discoveries.
  Results: NGTS-5b is a short-period planet with an orbital period of 3.3569866
+- 0.0000026 days. With a mass of 0.229 +- 0.037 MJup and a radius of 1.136 +-
0.023 RJup, it is highly inflated. Its mass places it at the upper boundary of
the sub-Jovian desert. Because the host is a K2 dwarf, we need to account for
the stellar parameters when NGTS-5b is analysed with regard to planet
populations.
  Conclusions: With red-sensitive surveys (e.g. with NGTS and TESS), we expect
many more planets around late-type stars to be detected. An empirical analysis
of the sub-Jovian desert should therefore take stellar parameters into account.

region of the neutron star. We find a power-law relation between the
neutron-star tidal deformability, $\Lambda$, and the neutron-star radius, R.
Without an explicit crust EoS, the model predicts smaller R and the difference
becomes significant for stars with large radii. To connect the neutron star
properties with nuclear matter properties, we confront the predicted values for
$\Lambda$, against the Taylor expansion coefficients of the Skyrme
interactions. There is no pronounced correlation between Skyrme parameters in
symmetric nuclear matter and neutron star properties. However, we find the
strongest correlation between $\Lambda$ and $K_{sym}$, the curvature of the

system control is difficult to achieve because of high-dimensional and
non-linear system dynamics, and the exploding state and action spaces for the
decision maker. Prior methods can be divided into two categories:
simulation-based and analytical approaches. Existing simulation approaches have
high-variance in Monte Carlo integration, and the analytical approaches suffer
from modeling inaccuracy. We adopted simulation modeling in specifying the
complex dynamics of a complex system, and developed analytical solutions for
searching optimal strategies in a complex network with high-dimensional

to understand proximity interactions among people and the diffusion, through
these interactions, of diseases, behaviors, and opinions. However, it remains a
challenge to track the proximity-based interactions of a whole community and
then model the social diffusion of diseases and behaviors starting from the
observations of a small fraction of the volunteer population. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that tries to connect together these sparse
observations using a model of how individuals interact with each other and how
social interactions happen in terms of a sequence of proximity interactions. We
apply our approach to track the spreading of flu in the spatial-proximity
network of a 3000-people university campus by mobilizing 300 volunteers from
this population to monitor nearby mobile phones through Bluetooth scanning and
to daily report flu symptoms about and around them. Our aim is to predict the
likelihood for an individual to get flu based on how often her/his daily
routine intersects with those of the volunteers. Thus, we use the daily
routines of the volunteers to build a model of the volunteers as well as of the
non-volunteers. Our results show that we can predict flu infection two weeks
ahead of time with an average precision from 0.24 to 0.35 depending on the
amount of information. This precision is six to nine times higher than with a
random guess model. At the population level, we can predict infectious
population in a two-week window with an r-squared value of 0.95 (a random-guess
model obtains an r-squared value of 0.2). These results point to an innovative
approach for tracking individuals who have interacted with people showing
symptoms, allowing us to warn those in danger of infection and to inform health
researchers about the progression of contact-induced diseases.

forecasting methods are rendered less useful due to the non-stationary
characteristic of solar power. The amount of operating reserves required to
maintain reliable operation of the electric grid rises due to the variability
of solar energy. The higher the uncertainty in the generation, the greater the
operating-reserve requirements, which translates to an increased cost of
operation. In this research work, we propose a unified architecture for
multi-time-scale predictions for intra-day solar irradiance forecasting using
recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs).
This paper also lays out a framework for extending this modeling approach to
intra-hour forecasting horizons thus, making it a multi-time-horizon
forecasting approach, capable of predicting intra-hour as well as intra-day
solar irradiance. We develop an end-to-end pipeline to effectuate the proposed
architecture. The performance of the prediction model is tested and validated
by the methodical implementation. The robustness of the approach is
demonstrated with case studies conducted for geographically scattered sites
across the United States. The predictions demonstrate that our proposed unified
architecture-based approach is effective for multi-time-scale solar forecasts
and achieves a lower root-mean-square prediction error when benchmarked against
the best-performing methods documented in the literature that use separate
models for each time-scale during the day. Our proposed method results in a
71.5% reduction in the mean RMSE averaged across all the test sites compared to
the ML-based best-performing method reported in the literature. Additionally,
the proposed method enables multi-time-horizon forecasts with real-time inputs,
which have a significant potential for practical industry applications in the
evolving grid.

description of many chemical processes. However, few methods can handle cases
where static correlation is present, and often these scale very unfavourably
with system size. Recently, multiple Hartree--Fock (HF) solutions have been
proposed as a basis for non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) to
provide multireference ground and excited state energies, although applications
across multiple geometries have been limited by the coalescence of HF
solutions. Holomorphic HF (h-HF) theory allows solutions to be analytically
continued beyond the Coulson--Fischer points at which they vanish but, until
now, this has only been demonstrated for small model systems. In this work, we
propose a general protocol for computing NOCI ground and excited state energies
using multiple HF solutions. To do so, we outline an active space variation of
SCF metadynamics that allows a chemically relevant set of HF states to be
identified, and describe how these states can be routinely traced across all
molecular geometries by exploiting the topology of h-HF solutions in the
complex plane. Finally, we illustrate our approach using the dissociation of
the fluorine dimer and the pseudo-Jahn--Teller distortion of cyclobutadiene,
demonstrating its applicability for multireference ground and excited states.

model using a complex nuclear potential. The excitation functions from barrier
transmission are smooth whereas the excitation functions from the optical model
show a significant sensitivity to the chosen imaginary potential. Cross
sections far below the Coulomb barrier are lower from barrier transmission than

in the tail of the imaginary part of the potential in the optical model. At
higher energies the calculations from the two models and all $\alpha$-nucleus
potentials converge. Finally, in contradiction to another recent study where a

algorithm known as Complementary Temporal Difference Learning (CTDL), which
combines a DNN with a Self-Organising Map (SOM) to obtain the benefits of both
a 'neocortical' and a 'hippocampal' system. Key features of CTDL include the
use of Temporal Difference (TD) error to update a SOM and the combination of a
SOM and DNN to calculate action values. We evaluate CTDL on grid worlds and the
Cart-Pole environment, and show several benefits over the classic Deep
Q-Network (DQN) approach. These results demonstrate (1) the utility of
complementary learning systems for the evaluation of actions, (2) that the TD
error signal is a useful form of communication between the two systems and (3)
the biological plausibility of the proposed approach.

larger quantities than $\kappa_g$ (e.g., the worst-case condition number among

collaborative localization approach is developed as a decentralized algorithm
and built in a distributed fashion where individual and relative pose
estimation techniques are combined for the group to localize against
surrounding environments. The MAVs initially detect and match salient features
between each other to create a sparse reconstruction of the observed
environment, which acts as a global map. Once a map is available, each MAV
performs feature detection and tracking with a robust outlier rejection process
to estimate its own pose in 6 degrees of freedom. Occasionally, one or more
MAVs can be tasked to compute poses for another MAV through relative
measurements, which is achieved by exploiting multiple view geometry concepts.
These relative measurements are then fused with individual measurements in a
consistent fashion. We present the results of the algorithm on image data from
MAV flights both in simulation and real life, and discuss the advantages of
collaborative localization in improving pose estimation accuracy.

that the self-confined single-electron structure in condensed helium-4 can be a
fascinating candidate for single-electron quantum nodes. Each electron in
helium forms a bubble of 1 to 2 nm radius and coherently interacts with
mid-infrared photons. A parametrically amplified femtosecond laser can drive
the electrons into any superposition between the ground and excited states. An
electron inside a slot-waveguide cavity can strongly couple with cavity photons

tasks, but interpreting the internal mechanism is a challenging problem. To
tackle this problem, we exploit a multi-channel attention mechanism in feature
space. Our network architecture allows us to obtain an attention mask for each
feature while existing CNN visualization methods provide only a common
attention mask for all features. We apply the proposed multi-channel attention
mechanism to multi-attribute recognition task. We can obtain different
attention mask for each feature and for each attribute. Those analyses give us
deeper insight into the feature space of CNNs. Furthermore, our proposed
attention mechanism naturally derives a method for improving the robustness of
CNNs. From the observation of feature space based on the proposed attention
mask, we demonstrate that we can obtain robust CNNs by intentionally
emphasizing features that are important for attributes. The experimental
results for the benchmark dataset show that the proposed method gives high
human interpretability while accurately grasping the attributes of the data,

attention of modeling the market competition, i.e., bid landscape forecasting.
The problem is formulated as to forecast the probability distribution of market
price for each ad auction. With the consideration of the censorship issue which
is caused by the second-price auction mechanism, many researchers have devoted
their efforts on bid landscape forecasting by incorporating survival analysis
from medical research field. However, most existing solutions mainly focus on
either counting-based statistics of the segmented sample clusters, or learning
a parameterized model based on some heuristic assumptions of distribution
forms. Moreover, they neither consider the sequential patterns of the feature
over the price space. In order to capture more sophisticated yet flexible
patterns at fine-grained level of the data, we propose a Deep Landscape
Forecasting (DLF) model which combines deep learning for probability
distribution forecasting and survival analysis for censorship handling.
Specifically, we utilize a recurrent neural network to flexibly model the
conditional winning probability w.r.t. each bid price. Then we conduct the bid
landscape forecasting through probability chain rule with strict mathematical
derivations. And, in an end-to-end manner, we optimize the model by minimizing
two negative likelihood losses with comprehensive motivations. Without any
specific assumption for the distribution form of bid landscape, our model shows
great advantages over previous works on fitting various sophisticated market
price distributions. In the experiments over two large-scale real-world
datasets, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions

reasonable to expect that the variant based on particle ontology can be (or

study in silico the validity of these observations and how they relate to each
other. We first addressed whether somatic mutations typically involved in
cancer may increase, in a statistically meaningful manner, the similarity
between common pathogens and the human exome. Our study shows that common
mutagenic processes increase, in the upper range of biologically plausible
frequencies, the similarity between cancer exomes and pathogen DNA at a scale
of 12-16 nucleotide sequences and established that this increased similarity is
due to the specific mutation distribution of the considered mutagenic
processes. Next, we studied the impact of mutation rate and showed that
increasing mutation rate generally results in an increased similarity between
the cancer exome and pathogen DNA, at a scale of 4-5 amino acids. Finally, we
investigated whether the considered mutational processes result in amino-acid
changes with functional relevance that are more likely to be immunogenic. We
showed that functional tolerance to mutagenic processes across species
generally suggests more resilience to mutagenic processes that are due to
exposure to elements of nature than to mutagenic processes that are due to
exposure to cancer-causing artificial substances. These results support the
idea that recognition of pathogen sequences as well as differential functional
tolerance to mutagenic processes may play an important role in the immune

Life, Intelligence} published in 1962 was a founding stone of SETI research in
the USSR. A number of observational projects in radio and optical domains were
conducted in the 1960s - 1990s. Theoretical studies focused on defining optimal
spectral domains for search of artificial electromagnetic signals, selection of
celestial targets in search for ETI, optimal methods for encoding and decoding
of interstellar messages, estimating the magnitude of astro-engineering
activity of ETI, and developing philosophical background of the SETI problem.
Later, in the 1990s and in the first two decades of the 21st century, in spite
of acute underfunding and other problems facing the scientific community in
Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, SETI-oriented research
continued. In particular, SETI collaborations conducted a number of surveys of
Sun-like stars in the Milky Way, searched for Dyson spheres and artificial
optical signals. Several space broadcasting programs were conducted too,
including a radio transmission toward selected stars. Serious rethinking was
given to incentives for passive and active participation of space civilisations
in SETI and CETI. This paper gives an overview of past SETI activities. It also

analysis is becoming a limiting factor. Therefore, this paper is investigating
the application of machine learning, namely object detection methods to aid in
the analysis of physical porotypes. With access to a large dataset of digitally
captured physical prototypes from early-stage development projects (5950 images
from 850 prototypes), the authors investigate applications that can be used for
analysing this dataset. The authors retrained two pre-trained object detection
models from two known frameworks, the TensorFlow Object Detection API and
Darknet, using custom image sets of images of physical prototypes. As a result,
a proof-of-concept of four trained models are presented; two models for
detecting samples of wood-based sheet materials and two models for detecting
samples containing microcontrollers. All models are evaluated using standard
metrics for object detection model performance and the applicability of using
object detection models in engineering design research is discussed. Results
indicate that the models can successfully classify the type of material and
type of pre-made component, respectively. However, more work is needed to fully
integrate object detection models in the engineering design analysis workflow.
The authors also extrapolate that the use of object detection for analysing
images of physical prototypes will substantially reduce the effort required for
analysing large datasets in engineering design research.

and cars, is becoming continuously more complex such that efficient
system-level design methods are becoming crucial. My research aims at
developing systems that help the designer express the complex design problem in
a declarative way and explore the design space to obtain divers sets of
solutions with desirable properties. To that end, we employ knowledge
representation and reasoning capabilities of ASP in combination with background
theories. As a result, for the first time, we proposed a sophisticated
methodology that allows for the direct integration of multi-objective
optimization of non-linear objectives into ASP. This includes unique results of
diverse sub-problems covered in several publications which I will present in
this work.

Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ fading channels with independent and
non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) branches is analysed. The probability
density function (PDF) and the moment generating function (MGF) of the maximum
i.n.i.d. Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ variates are derived first in terms of
the multivariate Fox's $H$-function that has been efficiently implemented in
the technical literature by various software codes. Based on this, the average
bit error probability (ABEP) and the average channel capacity (ACC) of SC
diversity with i.n.i.d. receivers are investigated. Moreover, we analyse the
performance of the energy detection that is widely employed to perform the
spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks via deriving the average detection
probability (ADP) and the average area under the receiver operating
characteristics curve (AUC). To validate our analysis, the numerical results
are affirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations.

purely mathematical platform, for providing intuitive understanding of the
properties of electromagnetic (EM) wave-matter interaction in nanostructures.
This approach is based on using the dimensionality reduction (DR) technique to
significantly reduce the dimensionality of a generic EM wave-matter interaction
problem without imposing significant error. Such an approach implicitly
provides useful information about the role of different features (or design
parameters such as geometry) of the nanostructure in its response
functionality. To demonstrate the practical capabilities of this DL-based
technique, we apply it to a reconfigurable optical metadevice enabling
dual-band and triple-band optical absorption in the telecommunication window.
Combination of the proposed approach with existing commercialized full-wave
simulation tools offers a powerful toolkit to extract basic mechanisms of
wave-matter interaction in complex EM devices and facilitate the design and
optimization of nanostructures for a large range of applications including
imaging, spectroscopy, and signal processing. It is worth to mention that the
demonstrated approach is general and can be used in a large range of problems
as long as enough training data can be provided.

symmetry-based phenomenological phase transition analysis. This paper focuses
on the first structural phase transition, SbI-SbIV, and the role of vibrations
in leading the transition. The phonon dispersion exhibits complex behaviour as
one approaches the structural transition, with the branches, corresponding to
the two transitions happening at high pressure in the Va elements (A7-to-BCC
and A7-to-PC) both showing softening.

inequalities designed to rule out effects caused by signalling. In this comment
we show that it is, however, possible to construct a non-contextual model which
explains the experimental data via direct influences, which we take to mean
that a measurement outcome has a (model-specific) causal dependence on other
measurements. We trace the apparent inconsistency to a definition of signalling
which does not account for all possible forms of direct influence. Further, we
cast doubt on the idea that any experimental data in psychology could provide
conclusive evidence for contextuality beyond that explainable by direct
influence.

turbulent boundary layer (TBL) it is relevant to develop numerical tools for
understanding how the structure reacts to TBL excitation. Usually, the wall
pressure fluctuations of the TBL are described through statistical quantities
(i.e. space-frequency or wavenumber-frequency spectra) which depend on the TBL
parameters. On the other hand, the vibro-acoustic models (i.e. Finite Elements,
Boundary Elements, Transfer Matrix Methods, Analytical models, etc) evaluate
deterministic transfer functions which characterise the response of the
considered structures. The first part of this paper focuses on the coupling
between the stochastic TBL and the deterministic vibro-acoustic models. Five
techniques are presented. Numerical applications on an academic marine test
case are proposed in order to discuss the calculation parameters and the
interests / drawbacks of each technique. In the second part of the paper, the
high frequency modelling with the Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) method is
considered. The focus is placed on the estimation of an important input of this
method: the injected power by the TBL into the structure for each third octave
band.
