approaches of non-cloning in quantum lambda-calculi. One is to forbid
duplication of variables, while the other is to consider all lambda-terms as
algebraic linear functions. The type system of Lambda-S has a constructor S
such that a type A is considered as the base of a vector space while S(A) is
its span. Lambda-S can also be seen as a language for the computational
manipulation of vector spaces: The vector spaces axioms are given as a rewrite
system, describing the computational steps to be performed. In this paper we
give an abstract categorical semantics of Lambda-S* (a fragment of Lambda-S),
showing that S can be interpreted as the composition of two functors in an
adjunction relation between a Cartesian category and an additive symmetric
monoidal category. The right adjoint is a forgetful functor U, which is hidden
in the language, and plays a central role in the computational reasoning.

has been typically approached by predicting parameters of heavyweight linear

the idea of encoding images into a latent non-linear representation of meshes.
The prior on 3D hand shapes is learned by training an autoencoder with
intrinsic graph convolutions performed in the spectral domain. The pre-trained
decoder acts as a non-linear statistical deformable model. The latent
parameters that reconstruct the shape and articulated pose of hands in the
image are predicted using an image encoder. We show that our system
reconstructs plausible meshes and operates in real-time. We evaluate the
quality of the mesh reconstructions produced by the decoder on a new dataset

channel is also used by the unlicensed users. However, it is done in a way that
no harm is done to the licensed users' transmission from sharing the same
channel with the unlicensed users. However, licensed users' transmission causes
interference on the unlicensed network. Poisson point process is used here to
model the location of the nodes and the effect of interference on the network.
We study how different factors such as number of retransmissions, SIR threshold
and outage can effect the throughput and energy efficiency of the network.
Throughput and energy efficiency are also both studied in constrained
optimization problems where the constraints are the SIR threshold and number of
retransmission attempts. We also show why it is important to use limited

considered interpretable. For example, a decision tree of depth 5 is much
easier to understand than one of depth 50. Limiting model size, however, often
reduces accuracy. We suggest a practical technique that minimizes this
trade-off between interpretability and classification accuracy. This enables an
arbitrary learning algorithm to produce highly accurate small-sized models. Our
technique identifies the training data distribution to learn from that leads to
the highest accuracy for a model of a given size.
  We represent the training distribution as a combination of sampling schemes.
Each scheme is defined by a parameterized probability mass function applied to
the segmentation produced by a decision tree. An Infinite Mixture Model with
Beta components is used to represent a combination of such schemes. The mixture
model parameters are learned using Bayesian Optimization. Under simplistic
assumptions, we would need to optimize for $O(d)$ variables for a distribution
over a $d$-dimensional input space, which is cumbersome for most real-world
data. However, we show that our technique significantly reduces this number to
a \emph{fixed set of eight variables} at the cost of relatively cheap
preprocessing. The proposed technique is flexible: it is \emph{model-agnostic},
i.e., it may be applied to the learning algorithm for any model family, and it
admits a general notion of model size. We demonstrate its effectiveness using
multiple real-world datasets to construct decision trees, linear probability
models and gradient boosted models with different sizes. We observe significant
improvements in the F1-score in most instances, exceeding an improvement of

magnetic moment modification, metallization, and even in superconductivity in
corresponding materials. Most reports on the pressure-induced spin crossover
with a large volume collapse so far focused on compounds with single transition
metal. Here we report a comprehensive high-pressure investigation of a mixed
Fe-Mn perovskite La2FeMnO6. Under pressure, the strong coupling between Fe and
Mn leads to a combined valence/spin transition: Fe3+(S = 5/2) to Fe2+(S = 0)
and Mn3+(S = 2) to Mn4+(S = 3/2), with an isostructural phase transition. The
spin transitions of both Fe and Mn are offset by ~ 20 GPa of the onset
pressure, and the lattice collapse occurs in between. Interestingly, Fe3+ ion
shows an abnormal behavior when it reaches a lower valence state (Fe2+)
accompanied by a + 0.5 eV energy shift in Fe K-absorption edge at 15 GPa. This
process is associated with the charge-spin-orbital state transition from high
spin Fe3+ to low spin Fe2+, caused by the significantly enhanced t2g-eg crystal
field splitting in the compressed lattice under high pressure. Density
Functional Theory calculations confirm the energy preference of the
high-pressure state with charge redistribution accompanied by spin state
transition of Fe ions. Moreover, La2FeMnO6 maintains semiconductor behaviors
even when the pressure reached 144.5 GPa as evidenced by the electrical
transport measurements, despite the huge resistivity decreasing 7 orders of
magnitude compared with that at ambient pressure. The investigation carried out
here demonstrates high flexibility of double perovskites and their good
potentials for optimizing the functionality of these materials.

sufficient spatial context. When damage is severe, it may be quite difficult to
even recognize the building. Accessing images of the pre-disaster condition of
those buildings is required to accurately identify the cause of the failure or
the actual loss in the building. Here, to address this issue, we develop a
method to automatically extract pre-event building images from 360o panorama
images (panoramas). By providing a geotagged image collected near the target
building as the input, panoramas close to the input image location are
automatically downloaded through street view services (e.g., Google or Bing in
the United States). By computing the geometric relationship between the
panoramas and the target building, the most suitable projection direction for
each panorama is identified to generate high-quality 2D images of the building.
Region-based convolutional neural networks are exploited to recognize the
building within those 2D images. Several panoramas are used so that the
detected building images provide various viewpoints of the building. To
demonstrate the capability of the technique, we consider residential buildings
in Holiday Beach, Texas, the United States which experienced significant
devastation in Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Using geotagged images gathered during
actual post-disaster building reconnaissance missions, we verify the method by
successfully extracting residential building images from Google Street View

variabilities in time scales of a few seconds to a few days. Depending on the
count rates in different energy bands and the nature of the conventional
color-color diagram, the variabilities were classified into sixteen classes,
which were later sequenced in ascending order of Comptonization Efficiency
(CE). The CE is the ratio of the phenomenological power-law and disk blackbody
model fitted spectral photon fluxes. For a better understanding of the flow
dynamics in one of the variability classes, namely $\chi$, we fitted spectra
with the physical two-component advective flow (TCAF) model. In $\chi$ class,
X-ray flux is steady with no significant variation, however, various $\chi$
subclasses are observed at different X-ray flux and variations of count rates
across different $\chi$ subclasses must be linked to the variation of flow
parameters such as the accretion rates, be it the Keplerian disc rate and/or
the low angular momentum halo rate. We find that in the $\chi_{2,4}$ classes,
which are reportedly devoid of significant outflows, the spectra could be
fitted well using TCAF solution alone. In the $\chi_{1,3}$ class, which are
always linked with outflows, a cutoff power-law model is needed in addition to
the TCAF solution. At the same time, the normalization required by this model
along with the variation of photon index and exponential roll-off factor
provides us with the information on the relative dominance of the outflow in
the latter two classes. TCAF fit also provides us with the size and location of
the Compton cloud along with its optical depth. Thus by fitting with TCAF, a
physical understanding of the flow geometry in different $\chi$ classes of GRS
1915+105 has been obtained.

we develop a theoretical framework that explicitly accounts for stochastic
fluctuations of an individual consumer's energetic reserves while foraging and
reproducing on a landscape with resources that range from uniformly distributed

in response to changes in the mean productivity of the resource landscape,
where depleted environments promote reproduction at lower energetic states,
greater investment in each reproduction event, and smaller litter sizes. We
then show that if resource variance scales with body size due to landscape
clustering, consumers that forage for clustered foods are susceptible to strong
Allee effects, increasing extinction risk. Finally, we show that the proposed
relationship between consumer body size, resource clustering, and Allee

deductive databases in a P2P (Peer to Peer) environment. Each peer joining a
P2P system provides or imports data from its neighbors by using a set of
mapping rules, i.e. a set of semantic correspondences to a set of peers
belonging to the same environment. Two different types of mapping rules are
defined: mapping rules allowing to import a maximal set of atoms not leading to
inconsistency (called maximal mapping rules) and mapping rules allowing to
import a minimal set of atoms needed to restore consistency (called minimal
mapping rules). Implicitly, the use of maximal mapping rules states it is
preferable to import as long as no inconsistencies arise; whereas the use of
minimal mapping rules states that it is preferable not to import unless a
inconsistency exists. The paper presents three different declarative semantics
of a P2P system: (i) the Max Weak Model Semantics, in which mapping rules are
used to import as much knowledge as possible} from a peer's neighborhood
without violating local integrity constraints; (ii) the Min Weak Model
Semantics, in which the P2P system can be locally inconsistent and the
information provided by the neighbors is used to restore consistency, that is
to only integrate the missing portion of a correct, but incomplete database;
(iii) the Max-Min Weak Model Semantics that unifies the previous two different
perspectives captured by the Max Weak Model Semantics and Min Weak Model
Semantics. This last semantics allows to characterize each peer in the
neighborhood as a resource used either to enrich (integrate) or to fix (repair)
the knowledge, so as to define a kind of integrate-repair strategy for each
peer.

systematically the effect of the non-uniformity in the distribution of texture

investigate this issue theoretically and numerically. We propose a continuous
model that takes into account the total energy required to create interfaces of
a droplet in two possible wetting states: Cassie-Baxter(CB) with air pockets
trapped underneath the droplet; and the other characterized by the homogeneous
wetting of the surface, the Wenzel(W) state. To introduce geometrical
non-regularity we suppose that pillar heights and pillar distances are Gaussian
distributed instead of having a constant value. Similarly, we suppose a
heterogeneous distribution of Young's angle on the surface to take into account
the chemical non-uniformity. This allows to vary the ""amount"" of disorder by
changing the variance of the distribution. We first solve this model
analytically and then we also propose a numerical version of it, which can be
applied to study any type of disorder. In both versions, we employ the same
physical idea: the energies of both states are minimized to predict the
thermodynamic wetting state of the droplet for a given volume and surface
texture. We find that the main effect of disorder is to induce the stability of
both wetting states on the same substrate. In terms of the influence of the
disorder on the contact angle of the droplet, we find that it is negligible for
the chemical disorder and for pillar-distance disorder. However, in the case of
pillar-height disorder, it is observed that the average contact angle of the
droplet increases with the amount of disorder. We end the paper investigating
how the region of stability of both wetting states behaves when the droplet

this type of data: denoise it with a learned model, then train our final model

denoising approach consists of two parts. First, a filtering function discards
examples from the distantly labeled data that are wholly unusable. Second, a
relabeling function repairs noisy labels for the retained examples. Each of
these components is a model trained on synthetically-noised examples generated
from a small manually-labeled set. We investigate this approach on the

extension of their model with pre-trained ELMo representations, which already

that supersedes previous methods. It is implemented by means of algorithms and

that are designed to be carried out on supercomputers. We show that vector
component generation of KS hypergraphs exhausts all possible vectors that can
be constructed from chosen vector components, in contrast to previous studies
that used incomplete lists of vectors and therefore missed a majority of
hypergraphs. Consequently, this unified method is far more efficient for
generations of KS sets and their implementation in quantum computation and
quantum communication. Several new KS classes and their features have been
found and are elaborated on in the paper. Greechie diagrams are discussed. A

congestion of a unidirectional two-lane freeway segment. The macroscopic
traffic dynamics are described by the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model respectively

the two lanes are governed by coupled $2 \times 2$ nonlinear hyperbolic partial
differential equations (PDEs). Lane-changing interactions between the two lanes
lead to exchanging source terms between the two pairs second-order PDEs.
Therefore, we are dealing with $4 \times 4$ nonlinear coupled hyperbolic PDEs.
Based on driver's preference for the slow and fast lanes, a reference system of
lane-specific uniform steady states in congested traffic is chosen. To
stabilize traffic densities and velocities of both lanes to the steady states,
two distinct variable speed limits (VSL) are applied at outlet boundary,
controlling the traffic velocity of each lane. Using backstepping
transformation, we map the coupled heterodirectional hyperbolic PDE system into
a cascade target system, in which traffic oscillations are damped out through
actuation of the velocities at the downstream boundary. Two full-state feedback
boundary control laws are developed. We also design a collocated boundary
observer for state estimation with sensing of densities at the outlet. Output
feedback boundary controllers are obtained by combining the collocated observer
and full-state feedback controllers. The finite time convergence to equilibrium
is achieved for both the controllers and observer designs. Numerical

states are complex-frequency solutions of the Maxwell's equations with outgoing
radiation conditions. For open dielectric structures without material gain or

non-Hermitian due to radiation losses. For applications in nanophotonics, it is
important to understand EPs for resonant states on small finite dielectric
structures consisting of conventional dielectric materials. To achieve this
objective, we study EPs of resonant states on finite sets of parallel

based on the hand-crafted features whose image representation ability is
limited. Secondly, they can not label foreground objects accurately due to the
dataset bias. Thirdly, in the refinement stage, the traditional Markov Random
Filed (MRF) inference is prone to over smoothness. For improving the above
problems, this paper proposes a joint method of priori convolutional neural
networks at superpixel level (called as ``priori s-CNNs'') and soft restricted

simultaneously to segment road region elaborately. To be specific, the
s-FCN-loc has two streams to process the original RGB images and contour maps
respectively. At the same time, the location prior is directly appended to the
siamesed FCN to promote the final detection performance. Our contributions are
threefold: (1) An s-FCN-loc is proposed that learns more discriminative
features of road boundaries than the original FCN to detect more accurate road
regions; (2) Location prior is viewed as a type of feature map and directly
appended to the final feature map in s-FCN-loc to promote the detection
performance effectively, which is easier than other traditional methods, namely
different priors for different inputs (image patches); (3) The convergent speed
of training s-FCN-loc model is 30\% faster than the original FCN, because of
the guidance of highly structured contours. The proposed approach is evaluated
on KITTI Road Detection Benchmark and One-Class Road Detection Dataset, and
achieves a competitive result with state of the arts.

multiple numerical tests demonstrated the power and efficiency of DMD in
representing data (i.e., in the interpolation mode), applications of DMD as a
predictive tool (i.e., in the extrapolation mode) are scarce. This is due, in
part, to the lack of rigorous error estimators for DMD-based predictions. We
provide a theoretical error estimator for DMD extrapolation of numerical
solutions to linear and nonlinear parabolic equations. This error analysis
allows one to monitor and controls the errors associated with DMD-based
temporal extrapolation of numerical solutions to parabolic differential
equations. We use several computational experiments to verify the robustness of
our error estimators and to compare the predictive ability of DMD with that of
proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), another member of the SVD family. Our
analysis demonstrates the importance of a proper selection of observables, as
predicted by the Koopman operator theory. In all the tests considered, DMD
outperformed POD in terms of efficiency due to its iteration-free feature. In
some of these experiments, POD proved to be more accurate than DMD. This
suggests that DMD is preferable for obtaining a fast prediction with slightly
lower accuracy, while POD should be used if the accuracy is paramount.

walking/running motion is a challenging issue that, despite the development of
new technologies and the advancement of knowledge, does not yet have a
satisfactory solution. In most of the proposed methods by researchers, to
maintain the stability of walking bipedal robots, it has been tried to ensure
the momentary stability of motion by limiting the motion to multiple
constraints. Although these methods have good performance in sustaining
stability, they leave the robot away from the natural movement of humans, with
low efficiency and high energy consumption. Hence, many researchers have turned
to the walking techniques that follow a certain motion limit cycle, in which we
can consider the overall stability rather than momentary. In this paper, a
method is proposed to maintain the stability of the limit cycle against
disturbance. For this purpose, the dynamical model of the biped robot is
extracted in the space of total momentum variables and, according to the
desired step length and speed, the motion limit cycle is designed.
Subsequently, a motion stabilizer is proposed based on the idea of length
shift, which is a natural human strategy for sustaining the balance in case of
impact. The simulations show that this technique has a good performance in
maintaining the stability of motion and has similar responses to human

as determinate relationships. However, there are still large amount of
unlabeled data, such as object pairs with less significant relationships or
even with no relationships. We refer to these unlabeled but potentially useful
data as undetermined relationships. Although a vast body of literature exists,
few methods exploit these undetermined relationships for visual relationship
detection.
  In this paper, we explore the beneficial effect of undetermined relationships
on visual relationship detection. We propose a novel multi-modal feature based
undetermined relationship learning network (MF-URLN) and achieve great
improvements in relationship detection. In detail, our MF-URLN automatically
generates undetermined relationships by comparing object pairs with
human-notated data according to a designed criterion. Then, the MF-URLN
extracts and fuses features of object pairs from three complementary modals:
visual, spatial, and linguistic modals. Further, the MF-URLN proposes two
correlated subnetworks: one subnetwork decides the determinate confidence, and
the other predicts the relationships. We evaluate the MF-URLN on two datasets:
the Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) and the Visual Genome (VG) datasets.
The experimental results compared with state-of-the-art methods verify the
significant improvements made by the undetermined relationships, e.g., the
top-50 relation detection recall improves from 19.5% to 23.9% on the VRD
dataset.

thanks to advances in clustered computing and big data technology. Existing
distributed algorithms typically assume {\it all the data are already in one
place}, and divide the data and conquer on multiple machines. However, it is
increasingly often that the data are located at a number of distributed sites,
and one wishes to compute over all the data with low communication overhead.
For spectral clustering, we propose a novel framework that enables its
computation over such distributed data, with ""minimal"" communications while a
major speedup in computation. The loss in accuracy is negligible compared to
the non-distributed setting. Our approach allows local parallel computing at
where the data are located, thus turns the distributed nature of the data into
a blessing; the speedup is most substantial when the data are evenly
distributed across sites. Experiments on synthetic and large UC Irvine datasets
show almost no loss in accuracy with our approach while about 2x speedup under
various settings with two distributed sites. As the transmitted data need not
be in their original form, our framework readily addresses the privacy concern
for data sharing in distributed computing.

is very close to that of Ge and much higher than that of GaAs. The obtained
refractive index implies that Fe2TiGe is a potential optical material that can
be used in optical devices such as photonic crystal, wave guides and solar
cells. The Debye temperature at ambient condition is 570 K and decreases slowly
with temperature. The Gruneisen parameter at ambient pressure and 300 K is 2.1

represent solution curves as holomorphic functions in the complex plane. The
holomorphicity, which provides global information of the curve at any regular
point, enables large step sizes in the path-following procedure such that
non-singular curve segments can be traversed with very few steps. When
approaching singular points, we switch to the traditional predictor-corrector
routine to pass through them and switch back afterward to the holomorphic
embedding routine. We also propose a warm starter when switching to the
predictor-corrector routine, i.e. a large initial step size based on the poles
of the Pad\'{e} approximation of the derived holomorphic function, since these
poles reveal the locations of singularities on the curve. Numerical analysis
and experiments on many standard IEEE test cases are presented, along with the
comparison to the full predictor-corrector routine, confirming the efficiency
of the method.

address this discrepancy, we quantify the role of cell birth and death on
glassy states in confluent tissues using simulations of an active vertex model
that includes cell motility, cell division, and cell death. Our simulation data
is consistent with a simple ansatz in which the rate of cell-life cycling and
the rate of relaxation of the tissue in the absence of cell cycling contribute
independently and additively to the overall rate of cell motion. Specifically,
we find that a glass-like regime with caging behavior indicated by subdiffusive

reduces rather than increases scatter in such a relation. We also find that one

researchers reveal that maximizing the margin distribution of whole training

linear constrains, which enhance the training feasibility and efficiency for
SVR to derived from maximizing the margin distribution. The theoretical and

holds a prominent role in the transport of biopolymers. Inspired by classical
Brownian ratchet, we develop a theoretical framework characterizing such

the polymer chain, provided with reversible binding of chaperones, undergoes
forward/backward diffusion, which is rectified by chaperones. We drop the
assumption of timescale separation and keep the length of a polymer chain
finite, both of which happen to be the key points in most of the previous
studies. Our framework makes it accessible to derive analytical expressions for
mean translocation velocity and effective diffusion constant in stationary
state, which is the basis of a comprehensive understanding towards the dynamics
of such process. Generally, the translocation of polymer chain across membrane
consists of three subprocesses: initiation, termination, and translocation of
the main body part of a polymer chain, where the translocation of the main body
part depends on the binding/unbinding kinetics of chaperones. That is the main
concern of this study. Our results show that the increase of forward/backward
diffusion rate of a polymer chain and the binding/unbinding ratio of chaperones
both raise the mean translocation velocity of a polymer chain, and roughly
speaking, the dependence of effective diffusion constant on these two factors
achieves similar behavior.

and data streaming algorithms in the setting of general graphs. It has been
recently shown (Monemizadeh et al. 2017) that for bounded-degree graphs, any
constant-query tester can be emulated in the random order streaming model by a
streaming algorithm that uses only space required to store a constant number of
words. However, in a more natural setting of general graphs, with no
restriction on the maximum degree, no such results were known because of our
lack of understanding of constant-query testers in general graphs and lack of
techniques to appropriately emulate in the streaming setting off-line
algorithms allowing many high-degree vertices.
  In this work we advance our understanding on both of these challenges. First,
we provide canonical testers for all constant-query testers for general graphs,
both, for one-sided and two-sided errors. Such canonizations were only known
before (in the adjacency matrix model) for dense graphs (Goldreich and Trevisan
2003) and (in the adjacency list model) for bounded degree (di-)graphs
(Goldreich and Ron 2011, Czumaj et al. 2016). Using the concept of canonical
testers, we then prove that every property of general graphs that is
constant-query testable with one-sided error can also be tested in
constant-space with one-sided error in the random order streaming model.
  Our results imply, among others, that properties like $(s,t)$
disconnectivity, $k$-path-freeness, etc. are constant-space testable in random
order streams.

improved obviously as the frequency of the weak laser field. Another finding is
the nonlinear correlation between the emission intensity of the backscattering

configuration. Since both of them are totally eclipsing binaries, the physical
parameters derived only by the photometric light curves are reliable.Meanwhile,
the period changes of the two targets were analyzed based on all available

semantics has a lot to say about the statistical collocation-based meanings of
content words, but provides little guidance on how to treat function words.
Formal semantics on the other hand, has powerful mechanisms for dealing with
relative pronouns, coordinators, and the like. Type-driven compositional
distributional semantics brings these two models together. We review previous
compositional distributional models of relative pronouns, coordination and a
restricted account of ellipsis in the DisCoCat framework of Coecke et al.
(2010, 2013). We show how DisCoCat cannot deal with general forms of ellipsis,
which rely on copying of information, and develop a novel way of connecting
typelogical grammar to distributional semantics by assigning vector
interpretable lambda terms to derivations of LCC in the style of Muskens &
Sadrzadeh (2016). What follows is an account of (verb phrase) ellipsis in which
word meanings can be copied: the meaning of a sentence is now a program with
non-linear access to individual word embeddings. We present the theoretical
setting, work out examples, and demonstrate our results on a toy distributional

as promising hardware for implementing quantum information and computing
protocols in scalable systems. Nevertheless, the coherent control of such
systems still faces challenges. Particularly, the lower gyromagnetic ratios of
the nuclear spins cause them to respond slowly to control fields, resulting in
gate times that are generally longer than the coherence time of the electron
spin. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for circumventing this problem by indirect
control: We apply a small number of short pulses only to the electron spin and
let the full system undergo free evolution under the hyperfine coupling between
the pulses. Using this scheme, we realize robust quantum gates in an
electron-nuclear spin system, including a Hadamard gate on the nuclear spin and
a controlled-NOT gate with the nuclear spin as the target qubit. The durations
of these gates are shorter than the electron spin coherence time, and thus
additional operations to extend the system coherence time are not needed. Our
demonstration serves as a proof of concept for achieving efficient coherent
control of electron-nuclear spin systems, such as NV centers in diamond. Our
scheme is still applicable when the nuclear spins are only weakly coupled to
the electron spin.

We conducted new observations using LOFAR Low Band Antennae (LBA) as well as
utilized the archival data from LOFAR and LWA. This study has increased the
total of all multi-frequency or wide-band scattering measurements up to a
dispersion measure (DM) of 150~pc\,cm$^{-3}$ by 60\%. The scatter broadening
timescale ($\tau_{sc}$) measurements at different frequencies are often
combined by scaling them to a common reference frequency of 1\,GHz. Using our
data, we show that the $\tau_{sc}$--DM variations are best fitted for reference
frequencies close to 200--300\,MHz, and scaling to higher or lower frequencies
results in significantly more scatter in data. We suggest that this effect
might indicate a frequency dependence of the scatter broadening scaling index
($\alpha$). However, a selection bias due to our chosen observing frequencies
can not be ruled out with the current data set. Our data did not favour any
particular model of the DM -- $\tau_{sc}$ relations, and we do not see a
statistically significant break at the low DM range in this relation. The
turbulence spectral index ($\beta$) is found to be steeper than that is
expected from a Kolmogorov spectrum. This indicates that the local ISM
turbulence may have a low wave-number cutoff or presence of large scale

deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a regressor to output the
drone steering commands. Furthermore, multiple auxiliary navigation paths that
form a navigation envelope are used for data augmentation to make the system
adaptable to real-life deployment scenarios. The approach is suitable for
automating drone navigation in applications that exhibit regular trips or
visits to same locations such as environmental and desertification monitoring,
parcel/aid delivery and drone-based wireless internet delivery. In this case,
the proposed algorithm replaces human operators, enhances accuracy of GPS-based
map navigation, alleviates problems related to GPS-spoofing and enables
navigation in GPS-denied environments. Our system is tested in two scenarios
using the Unreal Engine-based AirSim plugin for drone simulation with promising
results of average cross track distance less than 1.4 meters and mean waypoints

hyperspectral data with the highspectral resolution are capable of detecting
finer changes than using the traditional multispectral imagery. Nevertheless,
the high dimension of hyperspectral data makes it difficult to implement
traditional CD algorithms. Besides, endmember abundance information at subpixel
level is often not fully utilized. In order to better handle high dimension
problem and explore abundance information, this paper presents a General
End-to-end Two-dimensional CNN (GETNET) framework for hyperspectral image

1) Mixed-affinity matrix that integrates subpixel representation is introduced
to mine more cross-channel gradient features and fuse multi-source information;
2) 2-D CNN is designed to learn the discriminative features effectively from
multi-source data at a higher level and enhance the generalization ability of
the proposed CD algorithm; 3) A new HSI-CD data set is designed for the
objective comparison of different methods. Experimental results on real

of fairness, economic efficiency [17], and truthfulness against two kinds of
strategic behaviors [2,3]. Unfortunately, the crux on how to compute a
bottleneck decomposition of any graph is remain untouched. In this paper, we
focus on the computation of bottleneck decomposition to fill the blanks and
prove that the bottleneck decomposition of a network $G = (V, E; w_v)$ can be
computed in $O(n^6 log(nU))$, where $n = |V|$ and $U = max_{v\in V} w_v$. Based
on the bottleneck decomposition, a fair allocation in resource exchange system

collecting low-rate monitoring data from geographically distributed sensors, in
which timestamping the sensor data is a critical system function. This paper
considers a synchronization-free approach to timestamping LoRaWAN uplink data
based on signal arrival time at the gateway, which well matches LoRaWAN's
one-hop star topology and releases bandwidth from transmitting timestamps and
synchronizing end devices' clocks at all times. However, we show that this
approach is susceptible to a {\em frame delay attack} consisting of malicious
frame collision and delayed replay. Real experiments show that the attack can
affect the end devices in large areas up to about $50,000\,\text{m}^2$. In a
broader sense, the attack threatens any system functions requiring timely
deliveries of LoRaWAN frames. To address this threat, we propose a
$\mathsf{LoRaTS}$ gateway design that integrates a commodity LoRaWAN gateway
and a low-power software-defined radio receiver to track the inherent frequency
biases of the end devices. Based on an analytic model of LoRa's chirp spread
spectrum modulation, we develop signal processing algorithms to estimate the
frequency biases with high accuracy beyond that achieved by LoRa's default
demodulation. The accurate frequency bias tracking capability enables the
detection of the attack that introduces additional frequency biases. Extensive

applications in computer vision and in graphics. One such application, of
particular importance in computer animation, is the retargeting of motion from
one performer to another. While humans move in three dimensions, the vast
majority of human motions are captured using video, requiring 2D-to-3D pose and
camera recovery, before existing retargeting approaches may be applied. In this
paper, we present a new method for retargeting video-captured motion between
different human performers, without the need to explicitly reconstruct 3D poses
and/or camera parameters. In order to achieve our goal, we learn to extract,
directly from a video, a high-level latent motion representation, which is
invariant to the skeleton geometry and the camera view. Our key idea is to
train a deep neural network to decompose temporal sequences of 2D poses into
three components: motion, skeleton, and camera view-angle. Having extracted
such a representation, we are able to re-combine motion with novel skeletons
and camera views, and decode a retargeted temporal sequence, which we compare
to a ground truth from a synthetic dataset. We demonstrate that our framework
can be used to robustly extract human motion from videos, bypassing 3D
reconstruction, and outperforming existing retargeting methods, when applied to
videos in-the-wild. It also enables additional applications, such as
performance cloning, video-driven cartoons, and motion retrieval.

of Tur\'{a}n number $\text{ex}_{r}(n,\mathcal{T},\mathcal{H})$ has become the
fundamental core problem in extremal graph theory ever since the pioneering
work Tur\'{a}n's Theorem was published in $1941$. Although we have some rich

of two different hypergraph extensions of the complete bipartite graph
$K_{s,t}$. The first extension is the complete bipartite $r$-graph

$\mathcal{T}$ is an $r$-graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges. In particular,
when $\mathcal{T}$ is an edge or some specified complete bipartite $r$-graph,
we can determine their asymptotics.
  The second important extension is the complete $r$-partite $r$-graph
$K_{s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{r}}^{(r)}$, which has been widely studied. When

the runtime is exponential exclusively in this parameter. One particular
well-studied structural parameter is treewidth. Typically, a parameterized
algorithm utilizing treewidth takes or computes a tree decomposition, which is
an arrangement of a graph into a tree, and evaluates the problem in parts by
dynamic programming on the tree decomposition. In our research, we want to
exploit treewidth in the context of Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative
modeling and solving framework, which has been successfully applied in several
application domains and industries for years. So far, we presented algorithms
for ASP for the full ASP-Core-2 syntax, which is competitive especially when it
comes to counting answer sets. Since dynamic programming on tree decomposition
lands itself well to counting, we designed a framework for projected model
counting, which applies to ASP, abstract argumentation and even to problems
higher in the polynomial hierarchy. Given standard assumptions in computational
complexity, we established a novel methodology for showing lower bounds, and we
showed that most worst-case runtimes of our algorithms cannot be significantly

Glass, Macauley, Perkinson, Werner and Yang proved analogous results about the

  We clarify this still confounding picture by giving a canonical definition

between sandpile groups of planar dual graphs. Our canonical definition implies
the compatibility with planar duality via an extremely short argument. We also
show hidden symmetries of the problem by proving our results in the slightly

that the highest energy particles are mostly accelerated in young remnants, and
the maximum energy that middle-age and old SNRs can accelerate particles to
decreases rapidly with the decrease in shock speed. If SNRs dominate the CR

Moreover, the constructed CLF is ""almost diagonal"" in the sense that it
contains only a finite number of cross-products of the (generalized) Fourier
coefficients of the state. The methodology for the construction of a CLF is
combined with a novel methodology for boundary feedback design in parabolic

also shown that the obtained simple CLFs can provide nonlinear boundary
feedback laws which achieve global exponential stabilization of semilinear
parabolic PDEs with nonlinearities that satisfy a linear growth condition.

long-range coherence at Tc, they fluctuate in a way that breaks the rotational
invariance at Tnem and induces a distortion of the crystalline lattice. Similar

interesting papers. The results most commonly found in the literature prove
that neural networks approximate functions with classical smoothness to the
same accuracy as classical linear methods of approximation, e.g. approximation
by polynomials or by piecewise polynomials on prescribed partitions. However,
approximation by neural networks depending on n parameters is a form of
nonlinear approximation and as such should be compared with other nonlinear
methods such as variable knot splines or n-term approximation from
dictionaries. The performance of neural networks in targeted applications such
as machine learning indicate that they actually possess even greater
approximation power than these traditional methods of nonlinear approximation.
The main results of this article prove that this is indeed the case. This is
done by exhibiting large classes of functions which can be efficiently captured
by neural networks where classical nonlinear methods fall short of the task.
The present article purposefully limits itself to studying the approximation of
univariate functions by ReLU networks. Many generalizations to functions of
several variables and other activation functions can be envisioned. However,
even in this simplest of settings considered here, a theory that completely
quantifies the approximation power of neural networks is still lacking.

fractional diffusion equation, nonlinear diffusion equation and Langevin
equation in the presence of fractional, coloured or multiplicative noises. All
these formalisms presented different degrees of complexity and for this reason,
they have succeeded in describing anomalous diffusion phenomena.

impossible to identify, infant mortality provides a convenient global
assessment. In the present paper we examine a broad range of species from
mammals to fish to gastropods to insects. One of the objectives of our
comparative analysis is to test a conjecture suggested by reliability
engineering according to which the frequency of defects tends to increase
together with the complexity of organisms. For that purpose, we set up

for one QZ decomposition and a small number of linear solves on a size $N$
matrix. A piecewise interpolant provides dense output. The integration
represents a nominal setup cost afterwhich very many points can be computed at
negligible cost whilst preserving high accuracy. Furthermore, a 2-dimensional
interpolant suitable for scattered data query points in the wave vector plane
is described. Finally, a comparison is made with existing numerical methods for
this problem, revealing that the path-following scheme is asymptotically two
orders of magnitude faster in number of query points.

nature of harvested energy, resource constraints of the embedded platform, and
the computational demand of deep neural networks (DNNs) pose a unique and
challenging real-time scheduling problem for which no solutions have been
proposed in the literature. We empirically study the problem and model the
energy harvesting pattern as well as the trade-off between the accuracy and
execution of a DNN. We develop an imprecise computing-based scheduling
algorithm that improves the timeliness of DNN tasks on intermittently powered
systems. We evaluate Zygarde using four standard datasets as well as by
deploying it in six real-life applications involving audio and camera sensor
systems. Results show that Zygarde decreases the execution time by up to 26%
and schedules 9%-34% more tasks with up to 21% higher inference accuracy,
compared to traditional schedulers such as the earliest deadline first (EDF).

KLM preferential logics, based on the rational closure. It is well known that
the rational closure does not allow an independent handling of the inheritance
of different defeasible properties of concepts. Several solutions have been
proposed to face this problem and the lexicographic closure is the most notable
one. In this work, we consider an alternative closure construction, called the
Multi Preference closure (MP-closure), that has been first considered for
reasoning with exceptions in DLs. Here, we reconstruct the notion of MP-closure
in the propositional case and we show that it is a natural variant of Lehmann's
lexicographic closure. Abandoning Maximal Entropy (an alternative route already
considered but not explored by Lehmann) leads to a construction which exploits
a different lexicographic ordering w.r.t. the lexicographic closure, and
determines a preferential consequence relation rather than a rational
consequence relation. We show that, building on the MP-closure semantics,
rationality can be recovered, at least from the semantic point of view,
resulting in a rational consequence relation which is stronger than the
rational closure, but incomparable with the lexicographic closure. We also show
that the MP-closure is stronger than the Relevant Closure.

of congenital anomalies. In this paper we introduce a third possible cause,
namely random ""manufacturing"" discrepancies with respect to ``design'' values.
A clear way to demonstrate the existence of this component is to ``shut'' the
two others and to see whether or not there is remaining variability. Perfect
clones raised under well controlled laboratory conditions fulfill the
conditions for such a test. Carried out for four different species, the test
reveals a variability remainder of the order of 10%-20% in terms of coefficient
of variation. As an example, the CV of the volume of E.coli bacteria
immediately after binary fission is of the order of 10%. In short,
``manufacturing'' discrepancies occur randomly, even when no harmful mutation
or environmental factors are involved. Not surprisingly, there is a strong
connection between congenital defects and infant mortality. In the wake of
birth there is a gradual elimination of defective units and this screening
accounts for the post-natal fall of infant mortality. Apart from this trend,
post-natal death rates also have humps and peaks associated with various
inabilities and defects.\qL In short, infant mortality rates convert the
case-by-case and mostly qualitative problem of congenital malformations into a
global quantitative effect which, so to say, summarizes and registers what goes
wrong in the embryonic phase. Based on the natural assumption that for simple
organisms (e.g. rotifers) the manufacturing processes are shorter than for more
complex organisms (e.g. mammals), fewer congenital anomalies are expected.
Somehow, this feature should be visible on the infant mortality rate. How this
conjecture can be tested is outlined in our conclusion.

eavesdroppers and is appropriate for Internet of Things (IoT) applications is
considered. A worst case scenario is assumed, in the sense that, in order to
enhance their interception ability all eavesdroppers are located close to each
other, near the controller and collude to form joint receive beamforming. For
such a system, a novel cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) secure
transmission scheme for which an IoT device with a stronger channel condition
acts as an energy harvesting relay in order to assist a second IoT device
operating under weaker channel conditions, is proposed and its performance is
analyzed and evaluated. A secrecy sum rate (SSR) maximization problem is
formulated and solved under three constraints: i) Transmit power; ii)
Successive interference cancellation; iii) Quality of Service. By considering
both passive and active eavesdroppers scenarios, two optimization schemes are
proposed to improve the overall system SSR. On the one hand, for the passive
eavesdropper scenario, an artificial noise-aided secure beamforming scheme is
proposed. Since this optimization problem is nonconvex, instead of using
traditional but highly complex, bruteforce two-dimensional search, it is
conveniently transformed into a convex one by using an epigraph reformulation.
On the other hand, for the active multi-antennas eavesdroppers' scenario, the
orthogonal-projection-based beamforming scheme is considered, and by employing
the successive convex approximation method, a suboptimal solution is proposed.
Furthermore, since for single antenna transmission the
orthogonal-projection-based scheme may not be applicable a simple power control
scheme is proposed.

  Networks","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, Accepted",,,,"cs.MM cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop the optimal economical caching schemes in cache-enabled
heterogeneous networks, while delivering multimedia video services with
personalized viewing qualities to mobile users. By applying scalable video
coding (SVC), each video file to be requested is divided into one base layer
(BL) and several enhancement layers (ELs). In order to assign different
transmission tasks, the serving small-cell base stations (SBSs) are grouped
into K clusters. The SBSs are able to cache and cooperatively transmit BL and
EL contents to the user. We analytically derive the expressions for successful
transmission probability and ergodic service rate, and then the closed form of
EConomical Efficiency (ECE) is obtained. In order to enhance the ECE
performance, we formulate the ECE optimization problems for two cases. In the
first case, with equal cache size equipped at each SBS, the layer caching
indicator is determined. Since this problem is NP-hard, after the l0-norm
approximation, the discrete optimization variables are relaxed to be
continuous, and this relaxed problem is convex. Next, based on the optimal
solution derived from the relaxed problem, we devise a greedystrategy based
heuristic algorithm to achieve the near-optimal layer caching indicators. In
the second case, the cache size for each SBS, the layer size and the layer
caching indicator are jointly optimized. This problem is a mixed integer
programming problem, which is more challenging. To effectively solve this
problem, the original ECE maximization problem is divided into two subproblems.
These two subproblems are iteratively solved until the original optimization
problem is convergent. Numerical results verify the correctness of theoretical
derivations. Additionally, compared to the most popular layer placement
strategy, the performance superiority of the proposed SVC-based caching schemes
is testified.

  In this paper we investigate correlations between the fifth
