spontaneous cure and hepatocyte homeostasis. We first give general information
about hepatitis C. Secondly, We prove the existence of local, maximal and
global solutions of the model and establish some properties of this solution as
positivity and asymptotic behaviour. Thirdly we show, by the construction of an
appropriate Lyapunov function, that the uninfected equilibrium and the unique
infected equilibrium of the model of HCV are globally asymptotically stable
respectively when the threshold number $\mathcal{R}_{0}<1-\frac{q}{d_{I}+q}$
and when $\mathcal{R}_{0}>1$. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried
out using Maple software confirm these theoretical results.

so-called stripes) dominates the phase diagram of many strongly-correlated
systems. A prominent example is given by the Hubbard model, where these phases
compete and possibly coexist in a wide regime of electron dopings for both weak
and strong couplings. Here, we investigate this antagonism within a variational
approach that is based upon Jastrow-Slater wave functions, including backflow
correlations, which can be treated within a quantum Monte Carlo procedure. We
focus on clusters having a ladder geometry with $M$ legs (with $M$ ranging from
$2$ to $10$) and a relatively large number of rungs, thus allowing us a
detailed analysis in terms of the stripe length. We find that stripe order with
periodicity $\lambda=8$ in the charge and $2\lambda=16$ in the spin can be
stabilized at doping $\delta=1/8$. Here, there are no sizable superconducting
correlations and the ground state has an insulating character. A similar
situation, with $\lambda=6$, appears at $\delta=1/6$. Instead, for smaller
values of dopings, stripes can be still stabilized, but they are weakly
metallic at $\delta=1/12$ and metallic with strong superconducting correlations
at $\delta=1/10$, as well as for intermediate (incommensurate) dopings.
Remarkably, we observe that spin modulation plays a major role in stripe
formation, since it is crucial to obtain a stable striped state upon
optimization. The relevance of our calculations for previous density-matrix
renormalization group results and for the two-dimensional case is also
discussed.

deduce the $L^p$ weak continuity of the Cartan structural system for $p>2$: For

the weak solutions of the Cartan structural system or the Gauss--Codazzi--Ricci

to individual or geographic context. Yet, there is a lack of insight and
appropriate tools to promote active mobility and overcome transport
disadvantage from the local community perspective. The current study
investigates the promotion of walking and cycling adoption using a series of
focus groups with local residents in two geographic communities, namely
Chicago's (1) Humboldt Park neighborhood and (2) suburb of Evanston. The
research approach combines traditional qualitative discourse analysis with
quantitative text-mining tools, namely topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
The analysis uncovers the local mobility culture, embedded norms and values
associated with acceptance of active travel modes in different communities. We
observe that underserved populations within diverse communities view active
mobility simultaneously as a necessity and as a symbol of privilege that is
sometimes at odds with the local culture. The mixed methods approach to
analyzing community member discourses is translated into policy findings that
are either tailored to local context or broadly applicable to curbing
automobile dominance. Overall, residents of both Humboldt Park and Evanston
envision a society in which multimodalism replaces car-centrism, but
differences in the local physical and social environments would and should
influence the manner in which overarching policy objectives are met.

addition to revealing potential vulnerabilities. We study the extent to which
features learnt by a fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and its iterative
alternative (PGD) can preserve their defence properties against black and
white-box attacks under three different transfer learning strategies. We find
that using PGD examples during training on the source task leads to more
general robust features that are easier to transfer. Furthermore, under
successful transfer, it achieves 5.2% more accuracy against white-box PGD
attacks than suitable baselines. Overall, our empirical evaluations give
insights on how well adversarial robustness under transfer learning can

probabilities for expensive-to-evaluate models via information fusion and

probability estimators with the goal of variance reduction. We use low-fidelity
models to derive biasing densities for importance sampling and then fuse the
importance sampling estimators such that the fused multifidelity estimator is
unbiased and has mean-squared error lower than or equal to that of any of the
importance sampling estimators alone. By fusing all available estimators, the
method circumvents the challenging problem of selecting the best biasing
density and using only that density for sampling. A rigorous analysis shows
that the fused estimator is optimal in the sense that it has minimal variance
amongst all possible combinations of the estimators. The asymptotic behavior of
the proposed method is demonstrated on a convection-diffusion-reaction partial
differential equation model for which $10^5$ samples can be afforded. To
illustrate the proposed method at scale, we consider a model of a free plane
jet and quantify how uncertainties at the flow inlet propagate to a quantity of

segmentation in less processing time, whereas the 3D networks take the whole
image volumes to generated fine-detailed segmentation with more computational

this paper, we propose an end-to-end Feature-Fused Context-Encoding Network for
brain structure segmentation from MR (magnetic resonance) images. Our model is
implemented based on a 2D convolutional backbone, which integrates a 2D
encoding module to acquire planar image features and a spatial encoding module
to extract spatial context information. A global context encoding module is
further introduced to capture global context semantics from the fused 2D
encoding and spatial features. The proposed network aims to fully leverage the
global anatomical prior knowledge learned from context semantics, which is
represented by a structure-aware attention factor to recalibrate the outputs of
the network. In this way, the network is guaranteed to be aware of the
class-dependent feature maps to facilitate the segmentation. We evaluate our
model on 2012 Brain Multi-Atlas Labelling Challenge dataset for 134

turn longer as disorder and phononic oscillation are reduced with $Bi$ doping,
leading to wider $t_{2g}$ bands, which enhances the electrical conductivity.
Additionally, the enhancement in electrical conductivity and antiferromagnetic
correlation with $Bi^{3+}$ doping is attributed to the hybridization between
the $Y^{3+}(4p)$/$Bi^{3+}(6s/6p)$ orbital with $Ir^{4+}(5d)$ orbital as a

demonstrate that SNNs tend to show more resiliency compared to ANN under

by spike-based backpropagation are more adversarially robust than the ones
obtained by ANN-to-SNN conversion rules in several whitebox and blackbox
scenarios. Finally, we also propose a simple, yet, effective framework for
crafting adversarial attacks from SNNs. Our results suggest that attacks

current deep MVS methods achieve impressive results, they crucially rely on

consistency between multiple views as supervisory signal for learning depth
prediction in a wide baseline MVS setup. However, naively applying photo
consistency constraints is undesirable due to occlusion and lighting changes
across views. To overcome this, we propose a robust loss formulation that: a)
enforces first order consistency and b) for each point, selectively enforces
consistency with some views, thus implicitly handling occlusions. We
demonstrate our ability to learn MVS without 3D supervision using a real
dataset, and show that each component of our proposed robust loss results in a
significant improvement. We qualitatively observe that our reconstructions are
often more complete than the acquired ground truth, further showing the merits
of this approach. Lastly, our learned model generalizes to novel settings, and

mechanical systems can be described by Lagrangeans, a dynamical C*-algebra is
presented for non-relativistic particles at atomic scales. Without presupposing
any quantization scheme, this algebra is inherently non-commutative and
comprises a large set of dynamics. In contrast to other approaches, the
generating elements of the algebra are not interpreted as observables, but as
operations on the underlying system; they describe the impact of temporary
perturbations caused by the surroundings. In accordance with the doctrine of
Nils Bohr, the operations carry individual names of classical significance.
Without stipulating from the outset their `quantization', their concrete
implementation in the quantum world emerges from the inherent structure of the
algebra. In particular, the Heisenberg commutation relations for position and
velocity measurements are derived from it. Interacting systems can be described
within the algebraic setting by a rigorous version of the interaction picture.
It is shown that Hilbert space representations of the algebra lead to the
conventional formalism of quantum mechanics, where operations on states are
described by time-ordered exponentials of interaction potentials. It is also
discussed how the familiar statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics can
be recovered from operations.

its relationship to the antenna effects remains mostly unexplored. In this

Specifically, we consider a scenario where a fixed number of radio-frequency

measurements from the signals transmitted from the UAV and estimate the
location of the UAV from these observations. In order to study the impact of

to-date required detection of pulsations or a cyclotron resonance scattering
feature (CRSF), indicating a magnetised neutron star. However, pulsations are
observed to be transient and it is plausible that accretion onto the neutron
star may have suppressed the surface magnetic field such that pulsations and
CRSFs will be entirely absent. We may therefore lack direct means to identify
neutron star systems whilst we presently lack an effective means by which to
identify black hole ULXs. Here we present a possible method for separating the
ULX population by assuming the X-ray, mHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)
and day timescale periods/QPOs are associated with Lense-Thirring precession of
the inflow and outflowing wind respectively. The precession timescales combined
with the temperature of the soft X-ray component produce planes where the
accretor mass enters as a free parameter. Depending on the properties of the
wind, use of these planes may be robust to a range in the angular momentum
(spin) and, for high accretion rates, essentially independent of the neutron
star's surface dipole field strength. Our model also predicts the mHz QPO
frequency and magnitude of the phase-lag imprinted due to propagation through
the optically thick wind; in the case of NGC 5408 X-1 we subsequently infer a
black hole mass and high spin. Finally, we note that observing secular QPO
evolution over sufficient baselines may indicate a neutron star, as the
precession responds to spin-up which is not readily observable for black hole
primaries.

in tension with the hardness-ratio derived column densities. Enhanced

modeled it as a gravitationally coupled disk system of stars and atomic
hydrogen gas in the potential of the dark matter halo and treated the realistic
case where the rotation velocity varies with radius. We used a dense and
compact halo as implied by the observed rotation curve in this model. We
calculated the thickness of stellar and HI disks in terms of the half-width at
half-maximum of the vertical density distribution in a region of R=0 to 12 kpc
using input parameters constrained by observations. We obtain a mildly
increasing disk thickness up to R=6 kpc, in a good agreement with the observed
trend, and predict a strong flaring beyond this. To obtain this trend, the
stellar velocity dispersion has to fall exponentially at a rate of 3.2R_D ,
while the standard value of 2R_D gives a decreasing thickness with radius.
Interestingly, both stellar and HI disks show flaring in the outer disk region
although they are dynamically dominated by the dark matter halo from the very
inner radii. The resulting vertical stellar density distribution cannot be fit
by a single sech^2/n function, in agreement with observations, which show wings
at larger distances above the mid-plane. Invoking a double-disk model to
explain the vertical structure of LSBs as done in the literature may therefore
not be necessary.

$\mu_H^{-1}(T)\sim T^{\alpha}$ ($1\le\alpha\le2$), from $T=180$K until
$T\sim20$K, at which point the single-parameter scaling breaks down. The
functional form of the MR is distinct from the simple quadratic-to-linear
quadrature combination of temperature and magnetic field found in the optimally
doped iron superconductor BaFe${}_2$(As${}_{1-x}$P${}_x$)${}_2$. Further,
low-temperature departure of the MR in LSCO from its high-temperature scaling
law leads us to conclude that the MR curve collapse is not the result of
quantum critical scaling. We examine the classical effective medium theory
(EMT) previously used to obtain the quadrature resistivity dependence on field
and temperature for metals with a $T$-linear zero-field resistivity. It appears
that this scaling form results only for a binary, random distribution of
metallic components. More generally, we find a low-temperature, high-field
region where the resistivity is simultaneously $T$ and $B$ linear when multiple
metallic components are present. Our findings indicate that if mesoscopic
disorder is relevant to the magnetoresistance in strange metal materials, the
binary-distribution model which seems to be relevant to the iron pnictides is
distinct from the more broad-continuous distributions relevant to the cuprates.
Using the latter, we examine the applicability of classical effective medium

lessens the photometric precision and systematics removal requirements
necessary for detection, and increases the discoveries from long-term
observations with modest light curve precision. The Evryscope is a robotic
telescope array that observes the Southern sky continuously at 2-minute

study, covering all stars 9 < Mv < 14.5, in declinations -75 to -90 deg, we
recover 346 known variables and discover 303 new variables, including 168
eclipsing binaries. We characterize the discoveries and provide the amplitudes,
periods, and variability type. A 1.7 Jupiter radius planet candidate with a
late K-dwarf primary was found and the transit signal was verified with the
PROMPT telescope network. Further followup revealed this object to be a likely
grazing eclipsing binary system with nearly identical primary and secondary K5

the inclusion of WiggleZ matter power spectrum data, and show that this
improves the constraints on the two perturbative GDM parameters, $c^2_s$ and
$c^2_\text{vis}$, by a factor of 3, for a conservative choice of wavenumber

of this result we develop a GDM halo model to explore how non-linear structure
formation could proceed in this framework, since currently GDM has only been
defined perturbatively and only linear theory has been used when generating
constraints. We then examine how the halo model affects the constraints
obtained from the matter power spectrum data. The less-conservative wavenumber
range shows a significant difference between linear and non-linear modelling,
with the latter favouring GDM parameters inconsistent with $\Lambda$CDM,
underlining the importance of careful non-linear modelling when using this
data. We also use this halo model to establish the robustness of previously
obtained constraints, particularly those that involve weak gravitational
lensing of the cosmic microwave background. Additionally, we show how the
inclusion of neutrino mass as a free parameter affects previous constraints on

Simba cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. Simba grows black holes via
gravitational torque-limited accretion from cold gas and Bondi accretion from
hot gas, while feedback from black holes is modeled in radiative and jet modes

agreement with local studies of black hole properties, such as the black hole
mass--stellar velocity dispersion ($M_{BH}-\sigma$) relation, 2 the black hole
accretion rate vs. star formation rate (BHAR--SFR), and the black hole mass
function. $M_{BH}-\sigma$ evolves such that galaxies at a given $M_{BH}$ have
higher $\sigma$ at higher redshift, consistent with no evolution in
$M_{BH}-M_*$. For $M_{BH}<\sim 10^8 M_\odot$, $f_{Edd}$ is anti-correlated with
$M_{BH}$ since the BHAR is approximately independent of $M_{BH}$, while at
higher masses $f_{Edd}-M_{BH}$ flattens and has a larger scatter. BHAR vs. SFR
is invariant with redshift, but $f_{Edd}$ drops steadily with time at a given
$M_{BH}$, such that all but the most massive black holes are accreting in a
radiatively efficient mode at $z>\sim 2$. The black hole mass function
amplitude decreases with redshift and is locally dominated by quiescent
galaxies for $M_{BH}>10^{8}M_{\odot}$, but for $z>\sim 1$ star forming galaxies
dominate at all $M_{BH}$. The $z=0$ $f_{Edd}$ distribution is roughly lognormal
with a peak at $f_{Edd}<\sim 0.01$ as observed, shifting to higher $f_{Edd}$ at
higher redshifts. Finally, we study the dependence of black hole properties

This paper combines these approaches together to generate high-quality dense

Experiments show that the proposed method is able to generate high-quality

shows the potential to reduce the cost by using LIDARs with lower resolution in

to transform one structure into another. Edit distance is most commonly

edit distance is perhaps the most well-known. However, edit distance is not
limited to strings. For example, there are several edit distance measures for
permutations, including Wagner and Fischer's string edit distance since a
permutation is a special case of a string. However, another edit distance for
permutations is Kendall tau distance, which is the number of pairwise element
inversions. On permutations, Kendall tau distance is equivalent to an edit
distance with adjacent swap as the edit operation. A permutation is often used
to represent a total ranking over a set of elements. There exist multiple
extensions of Kendall tau distance from total rankings (permutations) to
partial rankings (i.e., where multiple elements may have the same rank), but

of hadrons and light nuclei covering over 9 orders of magnitudes from the ALICE
collaboration at the LHC were described by the model with remarkable accuracy

the temperature at which the various species of an equilibrated gas of hadrons
(including resonances) and nuclei chemically freeze out as the model assumes,
or whether it successfully parametrizes the yield data for a different reason.
The yields of weakly-bound light nuclei---the deuteron and the
hypertriton---provide insights into this issue. The analysis indicates that a
key assumption underlying the model---that hadrons (and nuclei), just prior to
chemical freeze-out temperature, are in thermal equilibrium and are
sufficiently dilute as to have particle distributions accurately described
statistically by a nearly ideal gas of hadrons and nuclei with masses given by
their free space values---appears to be inconsistent with the chemical
freeze-out temperature output by the model, at least for these weakly-bound

both beams are doughnut beams which have the same linear polarisation. The
total fields of this system are shown to display novel amplitude and phase
distributions and are shown to give rise to a ring or a finite ring lattice
composed of double rings and single central ring. When the beams have slightly
different frequencies the ring lattice pattern becomes a finite set of rotating
Ferris wheels and the whole pattern also moves axially between the focal

counter-propagating LG beams generate trapping potentials due to the dipole
force which can trap two-level atoms in the components of the ring lattice. We
also highlight a unique feature of this system which involves the creation of a
new longitudinal optical atom trapping potential due to the scattering force
which arises solely when $d \ne 0$. The results are illustrated using realistic

significant within-video variations caused by pose, occlusion and blur. To
tackle this problem, an effective idea is to propagate the identity from
high-quality faces to low-quality ones through contextual connections, which
are constructed based on context such as body appearance. However, previous
methods have often propagated erroneous information due to lack of uncertainty
modeling of the noisy contextual connections. In this paper, we propose the
Uncertainty-Gated Graph (UGG), which conducts graph-based identity propagation
between tracklets, which are represented by nodes in a graph. UGG explicitly
models the uncertainty of the contextual connections by adaptively updating the
weights of the edge gates according to the identity distributions of the nodes
during inference. UGG is a generic graphical model that can be applied at only
inference time or with end-to-end training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
UGG with state-of-the-art results in the recently released challenging Cast
Search in Movies and IARPA Janus Surveillance Video Benchmark dataset.

vibrational (infrared and Raman) and X-ray (absorption and emission)
spectroscopies, as well as recent data from X-ray scattering, are fully
consistent with a two-state picture of water. At ambient conditions there are
fluctuations between a dominating high-density liquid (HDL) and a low-density
form (LDL). These are related to the two forms of amorphous ice at very low
temperature, high-density amorphous (HDA) and low-density amorphous (LDA),
which interconvert in a first-order-like transition. This transition line is
assumed to continue into the so-called No-mans land as a liquid-liquid
transition and terminate in a critical point with very large fluctuations
between the two liquid forms. These fluctuations extend in a funnel-like region
up to ambient temperatures and pressures and give water its unusual properties
which are fundamental to life. With this picture we find simple, intuitive
explanations of the anomalous properties of water, such as the density maximum
at 4 C, why ice floats, and why the compressibility and heat capacity grow as
the liquid is cooled. We summarize by noting that in this picture, water is not
a complicated liquid, but two normal liquids with a complicated relationship.

images that consist of multiple spectral bands. Usually, the visual-optical
(VIS) and the thermal infrared (IR) spectra are combined to achieve higher
robustness for person detection especially in insufficiently illuminated
scenes. This paper focuses on analyzing existing detection approaches for their
generalization ability. Generalization is a key feature for machine learning
based detection algorithms that are supposed to perform well across different
datasets. Inspired by recent literature regarding person detection in the VIS
spectrum, we perform a cross-validation study to empirically determine the most
promising dataset to train a well-generalizing detector. Therefore, we pick one
reference Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architecture and three
different multispectral datasets. The Region Proposal Network (RPN) originally
introduced for object detection within the popular Faster R-CNN is chosen as a
reference DCNN. The reason is that a stand-alone RPN is able to serve as a
competitive detector for two-class problems such as person detection.
Furthermore, current state-of-the-art approaches initially apply an RPN
followed by individual classifiers. The three considered datasets are the KAIST
Multispectral Pedestrian Benchmark including recently published improved
annotations for training and testing, the Tokyo Multi-spectral Semantic
Segmentation dataset, and the OSU Color-Thermal dataset including recently
released annotations. The experimental results show that the KAIST
Multispectral Pedestrian Benchmark with its improved annotations provides the
best basis to train a DCNN with good generalization ability compared to the
other two multispectral datasets. On average, this detection model achieves a
log-average Miss Rate (MR) of 29.74 % evaluated on the reasonable test subsets
of the three datasets.

demonstrate that social networks may effectively use an IT-facilitated
intervention -- displaying things in common (TIC) between users (mutual
hometown, interest, education, work, city) -- to encourage friendship
formation. Displaying TIC updates an individual's belief about the shared
similarity with another and reduces information friction that may be hard to
overcome in offline communication. In collaboration with an online social
network, we conduct a randomized field experiment that randomly varies the
prominence of different things in common when a user is browsing a non-friend's
profile. The dyad-level exogenous variation, orthogonal to any (un)observed
structural factors in viewer-profile's network, allows us to cleanly isolate
the role of preferences for TIC in driving network formation and homophily. We
find that displaying TICs to viewers can significantly increase their
probability of sending a friend requests and forming friendships, and is
especially effective for pairs of people who have little in common. We also
find that displaying TIC can improve friendship formation for a wide range of
viewers with different demographics and is more effective when the TICs are
more surprising to the viewer.

We show that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the above equation determines the

determination of the Taylor series can be done in parallel with the detection
of an unknown cavity inside the domain or an unknown part of the boundary of
the domain. The method relies on the solution of the linearized partial data
Calder\'on problem [FKSU09], and implies the solution of partial data problems
for certain semilinear equations $\Delta u+ a(x,u) = 0$ also proved in [KU19].
  The results that we prove are in contrast to the analogous inverse problems
for the linear Schr\""odinger equation. There recovering an unknown cavity (or

pervades the Solar System, provides important insight into the formation and
dynamics of planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies. Here we present a new
set of data obtained using a novel technique: direct measurements of momentum
transfer to a spacecraft from individual particle impacts. This technique is
made possible by the extreme precision of the instruments flown on the LISA
Pathfinder spacecraft, a technology demonstrator for a future space-based
gravitational wave observatory that operated near the first Sun-Earth Lagrange
point from early 2016 through Summer of 2017. Using a simple model of the
impacts and knowledge of the control system, we show that it is possible to
detect impacts and measure properties such as the transferred momentum (related
to the particle's mass and velocity), direction of travel, and location of
impact on the spacecraft. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic
search for impacts during 4348 hours of Pathfinder data. We report a total of
54 candidates with momenta ranging from 0.2$\,\mu\textrm{Ns}$ to
230$\,\mu\textrm{Ns}$. We furthermore make a comparison of these candidates
with models of micrometeoroid populations in the inner solar system including
those resulting from Jupiter-family comets, Oort-cloud comets, Hailey-type
comets, and Asteroids. We find that our measured population is consistent with
a population dominated by Jupiter-family comets with some evidence for a
smaller contribution from Hailey-type comets. This is in agreement with
consensus models of the zodiacal dust complex in the momentum range sampled by
LISA Pathfinder.

channel problem: one is the Galilean-transformed Navier-Stokes equation which
gives a theoretical expression for the Reynolds stress; and the second the
maximum entropy principle which provides the spatial distribution of turbulent
kinetic energy. The first concept transforms the momentum balance for a control
volume moving at the local mean velocity, breaking the momentum exchange down
to its basic components. The Reynolds stress gradient budget confirms this
alternative interpretation of the turbulence momentum balance, as validated
with DNS data. The second concept of maximum entropy principle states that
turbulent kinetic energy in fully-developed flows will distribute itself until
the maximum entropy is attained while conforming to the physical constraints.
By equating the maximum entropy state with maximum allowable (viscous)
dissipation at a given Reynolds number, along with other constraints, we arrive
at function forms (inner and outer) for the turbulent kinetic energy. This
allows us to compute the Reynolds stress, then integrate it to obtain the
velocity profiles in channel flows. The results agree well with direct
numerical simulation (DNS) data at Re = 400 and 1000.

sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a widely used technique to investigate the function of
chromatin-related proteins in a genome-wide manner. ChIP-Seq generates large
quantities of data which can be difficult to process and analyse, particularly
for organisms with contig based genomes. Contig-based genomes often have poor
annotations for cis-elements, for example enhancers, that are important for
gene expression. Poorly annotated genomes make a comprehensive analysis of
ChIP-Seq data difficult and as such standardized analysis pipelines are
lacking. Methods: We report a computational pipeline that utilizes traditional
High-Performance Computing techniques and open source tools for processing and
analysing data obtained from ChIP-Seq. We applied our computational pipeline
""Rapid Analysis of ChIP-Seq data"" (RACS) to ChIP-Seq data that was generated in
the model organism Tetrahymena thermophila, an example of an organism with a
genome that is available in contigs. Results: To test the performance and
efficiency of RACs, we performed control ChIP-Seq experiments allowing us to
rapidly eliminate false positives when analyzing our previously published data
set. Our pipeline segregates the found read accumulations between genic and
intergenic regions and is highly efficient for rapid downstream analyses.
Conclusions: Altogether, the computational pipeline presented in this report is
an efficient and highly reliable tool to analyze genome-wide ChIP-Seq data
generated in model organisms with contig-based genomes.

operational gamma-ray astronomical observatory LHAASO is a new generation
multi-component facility located in Daocheng, Sichuan province of China, at an
altitude of 4410 meters. It aims at measuring with unprecedented sensitivity
the spectrum, composition, and anisotropy of cosmic rays in the energy range
between 10$^{12}$ and 10$^{18}$~eV, and acting simultaneously as a wide
aperture (one stereoradiant) continuously operating gamma-ray telescope in the
energy range between 10$^{11}$ and $10^{15}$~eV with the designed sensitivity
of 1.3\% of the Crab Unit (CU) above 100 TeV. LHAASO's capability of measuring
simultaneously different shower components (electrons, muons, and
Cherenkov/fluorescence light), will allow it to investigate the origin,
acceleration, and propagation of CR through measurement of the energy spectrum,
elemental composition, and anisotropy with unprecedented resolution. The
remarkable sensitivity of LHAASO will play a key role in CR physics and
gamma-ray astronomy for a general and comprehensive exploration of the high
energy universe and will allow important studies of fundamental physics (such
as indirect dark matter search, Lorentz invariance violation, quantum gravity)
and solar and heliospheric physics. The LHAASO Collaboration organized an
editorial working group and finished all editorial work of this science book,
to summarize the instrumental features and outline the prospects of scientific
researches with the LHAASO experiment.

classical optics, digital optics and holography. Although the classical Abbe
and Rayleigh resolution criteria have been thoroughly discussed in the
literature, there are still several issues which still need to be addressed,
for example the axial resolution criterion for coherent and incoherent
radiation, which is a crucial parameter of three-dimensional (3D) imaging, the
resolution criteria in the Fresnel regime, and the lateral and axial resolution
criteria in digital optics and holography. This work discusses these issues and
provides a simple guide for which resolution criteria should be applied in each
particular imaging scheme: coherent/incoherent, far- and near-field, lateral
and axial resolution. Different resolution criteria such as two-point
resolution and the resolution obtained from the image spectrum (diffraction
pattern) are compared and demonstrated with simulated examples. Resolution
criteria for spatial lateral and axial resolution are derived, and their
application in imaging with coherent and incoherent (noncoherent) waves is
considered. It is shown that for coherent light, the classical Abbe and
Rayleigh resolution criteria do not provide an accurate estimation of the
lateral and axial resolution. Lateral and axial resolution criteria based on an
evaluation of the spectrum of the diffracted wave provide a more precise
estimation of the resolution for coherent and incoherent light. It is also
shown that resolution criteria derived in approximation of the far-field
imaging regime can be applied for the near-field (Fresnel) regime.

the power generation and structural stability of downwind turbines in a wind
farm. In the field, where incoming flow and turbine operation are constantly
changing, wake recovery can be significantly influenced by dynamic wake
modulation, which has not yet been explored. Here we present the first
investigation of dynamic wake modulation in the near wake of a utility-scale
turbine and quantify its relationship with changing conditions. This
investigation is enabled using novel super-large-scale flow visualization with
natural snowfall, providing unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution to resolve
instantaneous changes of the wake envelope. These measurements reveal the
significant influence of dynamic wake modulation on wake recovery. Further, our
study uncovers the direct connection of dynamic wake modulation with
operational parameters readily available to the turbine, paving the way for
more precise wake prediction and control under field conditions for wind farm

distribution that is heavy-tailed. It has been shown that L\'{e}vy flights can
maximize the efficiency of resource searching in uncertain environments, and
also movements of many foragers and wandering animals have been shown to follow
a L\'{e}vy distribution. The reason mainly comes from that the L\'{e}vy
distribution, has an infinite second moment, and hence is more likely to
generate an offspring that is farther away from its parent. However, the
investigation into the efficiency of other different heavy-tailed probability
distributions in swarm-based searches is still insufficient up to now. For
swarm-based search algorithms, randomness plays a significant role in both
exploration and exploitation, or diversification and intensification.
Therefore, it's necessary to discuss the optimal randomness in swarm-based
search algorithms. In this study, CS is taken as a representative method of
swarm-based optimization algorithms, and the results can be generalized to
other swarm-based search algorithms. In this paper, four different types of
commonly used heavy-tailed distributions, including Mittag-Leffler
distribution, Pareto distribution, Cauchy distribution, and Weibull
distribution, are considered to enhance the searching ability of CS. Then four
novel CS algorithms are proposed and experiments are carried out on 20
benchmark functions to compare their searching performances. Finally, the
proposed methods are used to system identification to demonstrate the
effectiveness.

related to non perturbative properties of the quark hadronisation process, and
encoded in the so-called Polarising Fragmentation Function (PFF). Recent Belle
data have shown a non zero Lambda polarisation also in unpolarised e+ e-

shown how they can originate a polarisation P_Lambda different from 0 and give
explicit expressions for it in terms of the PFFs. Although the Belle data do
not allow yet, in our approach, an extraction of the PFFs, some clear
predictions are given, suggesting crucial measurements, and estimates of
P_Lambda are computed, in qualitative agreement with the Belle data.

We use both instance-aware semantic segmentation and sparse scene flow to

ensuring that the system is able to model objects with the potential to
transition from static to dynamic, such as parked cars. Given camera poses
estimated from visual odometry, both the background and the (potentially)
moving objects are reconstructed separately by fusing the depth maps computed
from the stereo input. In addition to visual odometry, sparse scene flow is
also used to estimate the 3D motions of the detected moving objects, in order
to reconstruct them accurately. A map pruning technique is further developed to
improve reconstruction accuracy and reduce memory consumption, leading to
increased scalability. We evaluate our system thoroughly on the well-known
KITTI dataset. Our system is capable of running on a PC at approximately 2.5Hz,

generality, we show that, for every integer $p\ge 1$, there exists $\eta_p>0$
such that if $\kappa_4(F)<\eta_p$ then the Malliavin derivative of $F$ admits a
negative moment of order $p$. This entails that any sequence of random
variables in the second Wiener chaos converging in distribution to a
non--degenerated Gaussian is getting more regular as its distribution is
getting close to the normal law. This substantially generalizes some recent
findings contained in \cite{hu2014convergence,hu2015density,nourdin2016fisher}
where analogous statements were given with additional assumptions which we are
able to remove here. Moreover, we provide a multivariate version of this
Theorem.
  Our main contribution concerns the case of the third Wiener chaos which is
notoriously more delicate as one cannot anymore decompose the random variables
into a linear combination of i.i.d. random variables. We still prove that the
same phenomenon of regularization along central convergence occurs.
Unfortunately, we are not able to provide a statement as strong as the previous
one, but we can show that the usual non--degeneracy estimates of the Malliavin
derivative given by the Carbery-Wright inequality can be improved by a factor
three. Our proof introduces new techniques such that a specific Malliavin

have previously been obtained by Hara and Slade in sufficiently high

specified. We rely on the non-backtracking lace expansion (NoBLE) method that
we have recently developed. The NoBLE makes use of an alternative lace
expansion for LAs and LTs that perturbs around non-backtracking random walk
rather than simple random walk, leading to smaller corrections. The NoBLE
method then provides a careful computational analysis that improves the
dimension above which the result applies. Universality arguments predict that
the upper critical dimension, above which our results apply, is equal to
$d_c=8$ for both models, as is known for sufficiently spread-out models by the
results of Hara and Slade mentioned earlier.

expansion for the LT and LA two-point functions; (b) to bound the
non-backtracking lace-expansion coefficients, thus showing that our general
NoBLE methodology can be applied; and (c) to obtain sharp numerical bounds on

full configuration interaction (MBE-FCI) method, we introduce the concept of
multideterminantal expansion references. Through theoretical arguments and
numerical validations, the use of this class of starting points is shown to
result in a focussed compression of the MBE decomposition of the FCI energy,
thus allowing chemical problems dominated by strong correlation to be addressed
by the method. The general applicability and performance enhancements of
MBE-FCI are verified for standard stress tests such as the bond dissociations
in H$_2$O, N$_2$, C$_2$, and a linear H$_{10}$ chain. Furthermore, the benefits
of employing a multideterminantal expansion reference in accelerating
calculations of high accuracy are discussed, with an emphasis on calculations
in extended basis sets. As an illustration of this latter quality of the
MBE-FCI method, results for H$_2$O and C$_2$ in basis sets ranging from double-
to pentuple-$\zeta$ quality are presented, demonstrating near-ideal parallel
scaling on up to almost $25000$ processing units.

photometric measurement techniques for bright (<11 magnitude) stars using the
small telescope systems that today's amateur astronomers typically use. One
technique is based on recent work using a beam-shaping diffuser method
(Stefansson et al., (2017).) The other is based on the widely used ""defocusing""
method. We also developed and used a statistical photometric performance model
to better understand the error components of the measurements to identify and
quantify any difference in performance between the two methods. AstroImageJ
(Collins et al. (2017)) was used for the exoplanet image analysis to provide
the measured values and exoplanet models described in this study. Both methods
were used at the Mark Slade Remote Observatory (MSRO) to conduct in-transit
exoplanet observations of exoplanets HAT-P-30b/WASP-51b, HAT-P-16b, and a
partial of WASP-93b. Observations of exoplanets KELT-1b and K2-100b and other
stars were also performed at the MSRO to further understand and characterize
the performance of the diffuser method under various sky conditions. In
addition, both in-transit and out-of-transit observations of exoplanets
HAT-P-23b, HAT-P-33b, and HAT-P-34b were performed at the Conti Private
Observatory. We found that for observing bright stars, the diffuser method
outperformed the defocus method when using small telescopes with poor tracking.
We also found the diffuser method noticeably reduced the scintillation noise
compared with the defocus method and provided high-precision results in
typical, average sky conditions through all lunar phases. For small telescopes
using excellent auto-guiding techniques and effective calibration procedures,
we found the defocus method was equal to or in some cases better than the
diffuser method when observing with good-to-excellent sky conditions.

energy-momentum-powered gravity models, in which the matter side of Einstein's
equations is modified by the addition of a term proportional to some power,
$n$, of the energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the canonical linear term.
In this work we treat these models as phenomenological extensions of the
standard $\Lambda$CDM, containing both matter and a cosmological constant. We
also quantitatively constrain the additional model parameters using low
redshift background cosmology data that are specifically from Type Ia
supernovas and Hubble parameter measurements. We start by studying specific
cases of these models with fixed values of $n,$ which lead to an analytic
expression for the Friedmann equation; we discuss both their current
constraints and how the models may be further constrained by future
observations of Type Ia supernovas for WFIRST complemented by measurements of
the redshift drift by the ELT. We then consider and constrain a more extended
parameter space, allowing $n$ to be a free parameter and considering scenarios
with and without a cosmological constant. These models do not solve the
cosmological constant problem per se. Nonetheless these models can
phenomenologically lead to a recent accelerating universe without a
cosmological constant at the cost of having a preferred matter density of
around $\Omega_M\sim0.4$ instead of the usual $\Omega_M\sim0.3$. Finally we
also briefly constrain scenarios without a cosmological constant, where the
single component has a constant equation of state which needs not be that of
matter; we provide an illustrative comparison of this model with a more
standard dynamical dark energy model with a constant equation of state.

second problem is the high class imbalance encountered in real-world
multi-class datasets. Methods: To use high-resolution images, we propose a
novel patch-based attention architecture that provides global context between
small, high-resolution patches. We modify three pretrained architectures and
study the performance of patch-based attention. To counter class imbalance
problems, we compare oversampling, balanced batch sampling, and class-specific
loss weighting. Additionally, we propose a novel diagnosis-guided loss
weighting method which takes the method used for ground-truth annotation into
account. Results: Our patch-based attention mechanism outperforms previous
methods and improves the mean sensitivity by 7%. Class balancing significantly
improves the mean sensitivity and we show that our diagnosis-guided loss
weighting method improves the mean sensitivity by 3% over normal loss
balancing. Conclusion: The novel patch-based attention mechanism can be
integrated into pretrained architectures and provides global context between
local patches while outperforming other patch-based methods. Hence, pretrained
architectures can be readily used with high-resolution images without
downsampling. The new diagnosis-guided loss weighting method outperforms other
methods and allows for effective training when facing class imbalance.
Significance: The proposed methods improve automatic skin lesion
classification. They can be extended to other clinical applications where
high-resolution image data and class imbalance are relevant.

electronic-structure calculations using density functional theory or
tight-binding model Hamiltonians, and also offers bonded or reactive empirical
force fields in many different parametrizations. Density functional theory is
implemented using either a plane-wave basis or expansion of electronic states

of advanced modules, including Green's-function methods for electron transport
simulations and surface calculations, first-principles electron-phonon and
electron-photon couplings, simulation of atomic-scale heat transport, ion
dynamics, spintronics, optical properties of materials, static polarization,
and more. Seamless integration of the different simulation engines into a
common platform allows for easy combination of different simulation methods
into complex workflows. Besides giving a general overview and presenting a
number of implementation details not previously published, we also present four
different application examples. These are calculations of the phonon-limited

teaching paradigm with multiple distributed teachers. We focus on consensus
super teaching. It aims at organizing distributed teachers to jointly select a
compact while informative training subset from data hosted by the teachers to
make a learner learn better. The challenges arise from three perspectives.
First, the state-of-the-art pool-based super teaching method applies
mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) which does not scale well to very
large data sets. Second, it is desirable to restrict data access of the
teachers to only their own data during the collaboration stage to mitigate
privacy leaks. Finally, the teaching collaboration should be
communication-efficient since large communication overheads can cause
synchronization delays between teachers.
  To address these challenges, we formulate collaborative teaching as a
consensus and privacy-preserving optimization process to minimize teaching
risk. We theoretically demonstrate the necessity of collaboration between
teachers for improving the learner's learning. Furthermore, we show that the
proposed method enjoys a similar property as the Oracle property of adaptive
Lasso. The empirical study illustrates that our teaching method can deliver
significantly more accurate teaching results with high speed, while the
non-collaborative MINLP-based super teaching becomes prohibitively expensive to
compute.

non-parametric tools successfully used in signal processing, statistics, and
machine learning. In this work, we aim to address three issues of the classical
RKHS based techniques. First, they require the RKHS to be known a priori, which
is unrealistic in many applications. Furthermore, the choice of RKHS affects
the shape and smoothness of the solution, thus impacting its performance.
Second, RKHSs are ill-equipped to deal with heterogeneous degrees of
smoothness, i.e., with functions that are smooth in some parts of their domain
but vary rapidly in others. Finally, the computational complexity of evaluating
the solution of these methods grows with the number of data points, rendering
these techniques infeasible for many applications. Though kernel learning,
local kernel adaptation, and sparsity have been used to address these issues,
many of these approaches are computationally intensive or forgo optimality
guarantees. We tackle these problems by leveraging a novel integral
representation of functions in RKHSs that allows for arbitrary centers and
different kernels at each center. To address the complexity issues, we then
write the function estimation problem as a sparse functional program that
explicitly minimizes the support of the representation leading to low
complexity solutions. Despite their non-convexity and infinite dimensionality,
we show these problems can be solved exactly and efficiently by leveraging
duality, and we illustrate this new approach in simulated and real data.

158 $\mu$m-[CII] line is a powerful tool for the study of the energetics and
physical conditions (e.g., temperature and density) of photodissociation
regions (PDRs). However, there are few observational studies that exploit this
synergy. Aims. Here we explore the relation between CRRLs and the 158
$\mu$m-[CII] line in light of new observations and models. Methods. We present
new and existing observations of CRRLs in the frequency range 0.15--230 GHz
with ALMA, VLA, the GBT, Effelsberg 100m, and LOFAR towards Orion~A (M42). We
complement these observations with SOFIA observations of the 158 $\mu$m-[CII]
line. We studied two PDRs: the foreground atomic gas, known as the Veil, and
the dense PDR between the HII region and the background molecular cloud.
Results. In the Veil we are able to determine the gas temperature and electron
density, which we use to measure the ionization parameter and the photoelectric
heating efficiency. In the dense PDR, we are able to identify a layered PDR
structure at the surface of the molecular cloud to the south of the Trapezium
cluster. There we find that the radio lines trace the colder portion of the
ionized carbon layer, the C$^{+}$/C/CO interface. By modeling the emission of
the $158$~$\mu$m-[CII] line and CRRLs as arising from a PDR we derive a thermal
pressure $>5\times10^{7}$ K cm$^{-3}$ and a radiation field
$G_{0}\approx10^{5}$ close to the Trapezium. Conclusions. This work provides
additional observational support for the use of CRRLs and the 158 $\mu$m-[CII]
line as complementary tools to study dense and diffuse PDRs, and highlights the
usefulness of CRRLs as probes of the C$^{+}$/C/CO interface.

  While makespan minimization using routing has been intensely studied for the
multiple unicasts problem, no bounds on network coding gaps for this problem
are known. We develop new techniques which allow us to upper bound the network
coding gap for the makespan of $k$ unicasts, proving this gap is at most
polylogarithmic in $k$. Complementing this result, we show there exist
instances of $k$ unicasts for which this coding gap is polylogarithmic in $k$.
Our results also hold for average completion time, and more generally any
$\ell_p$ norm of completion times.

capability to transfer processes into new operational windows and achieving
significant process intensification. However, the hydrodynamic behavior of
Taylor droplets is not yet entirely understood. In this work, we introduce a
model to determine the excess velocity of Taylor droplets in square
microchannels. This velocity difference between the droplet and the total
superficial velocity of the flow has a direct influence on the droplet
residence time and is linked to the pressure drop. Since the droplet does not
occupy the entire channel cross section, it enables the continuous phase to
bypass the droplet through the corners. A consideration of the continuity
equation generally relates the excess velocity to the mean flow velocity. We
base the quantification of the bypass flow on a correlation for the droplet cap
deformation from its static shape. The cap deformation reveals the forces of
the flowing liquids exerted onto the interface and allows estimating the local
driving pressure gradient for the bypass flow. The characterizing parameters
are identified as the bypass length, the wall film thickness, the viscosity
ratio between both phases and the Ca-number. The proposed model is adapted with
a stochastic, metaheuristic optimization approach based on high-speed camera
measurements. In addition, our model is successfully verified with published
empirical data.

ligand binding protein to have a potential for allosteric regulation and for
further evolution. In addition, such proteins generically change their
conformation upon binding. O. Rivoire has recently proposed an evolutionary
scenario that explains these properties as a generic byproduct of selection for
exquisite discrimination between very similar ligands. The initial claim was
supported by two classes of basic examples: continuous protein models with
small numbers of degrees of freedom, on which the development of a
conformational switch was established, and a 2-dimensional spin glass model
supporting the rest of the statement. This work aimed to clarify the
implication of the exquisite discrimination for smooth models with large number
of degrees of freedom, the situation closer to real biological systems. With
the help of differential geometry, jet-space analysis, and transversality
theorems, it is shown that the claim holds true for any generic flexible system
that can be described in terms of smooth manifolds. The result suggests that,
indeed, evolutionary solutions to the exquisite discrimination problem, if
exist, are located near a codimension-1 subspace of the appropriate genotypical
space. This constraint, in turn, gives rise to a potential for the allosteric
regulation of the discrimination via generic conformational changes upon
binding.

interest. An exact understanding of the underlying hydrodynamic interrelations
is the key for successful reactor layout and reaction control. To examine the
local hydrodynamic behavior, non-invasive optical measurements techniques like
particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) or (micro)particle image velocimetry
((\textmu)PIV) are the method of choice, since they provide precise velocity
measurement with excellent spatial resolution. Such optical approaches require
refractive index matching (RIM) of the involved flow phases to prevent optical
distortion due to light refraction and reflection at the interfaces.
Established RIM approaches often provide a single one degree of freedom which
is sufficient to match the RI of the flow phases solely. With that, the
material properties ($Oh$ number) are fixed and the relevant dimensionless
numbers ($Ca$, $Re$) may only be altered hydrodynamically or geometrically. To
avoid expansive geometric scaling of the microchannels, we propose an approach
using two binary mixtures (double-binary mixtures) to introduce an additional
degree of freedom. The approach allows examining liquid-liquid two-phase flows
at a distinct velocity while being able to change the material combination
($Oh$-Number). Therefore $Ca$ and $Re$ can be chosen individually and the RIM
provides undisturbed optical access. We present 4 different binary mixtures to
be used, e.g. with Taylor droplets. The relevant material parameters are
successfully correlated to measurement data, which delivers a system of
equations that determines the mass fractions and the velocities to address $Re$
and $Ca$ individually. A proof-of-principle for the proposed double binary
mixture RIM-approach is successfully established using \textmu PIV raw images.

n-dimensional nonlinear ODEs in terms of the set of toroidal radii
$(a_{i})_{i=1}^{n}$ or the radial moduli fields
$(\psi_{i})_{i=1}^{n}=(\log(a_{i}(t))_{i=1}^{n}$ of the n-torus
$\mathbb{T}^{n}$. This geometry is also the basis of Kasner-Bianchi-type
cosmologies. The equations are trivially satisfied for static solutions
$\psi_{i}^{E}=\psi^{E}$ or radii $a_{i}^{E}=a^{E}$, describing an initially
static toroidal 'micro-universe' or 'vacuum bubble'. It is Lyapunov stable to
short-pulse deterministic perturbations, which have a sharp Gaussian profile:
the perturbed radii rapidly converge to new attractors and therefore to new
stable equilibria. These perturbations induce transitions between stable
states. Introducing classical random fluctuations or perturbations, with a
regulated covariance, the radial moduli become Gaussian random fields
paramatrizing a 'toroidal random geometry'. The randomly perturbed Einstein
equations are then interpreted as a stochastic n-dimensional nonlinear
dynamical system. Non-vanishing 'cosmological constant' terms are retained
within the averaged equations since they are nonlinear. This is analogous to
averaging the Navier-Stokes equations in statistical turbulence theory, which
yields an additional non-vanishing Reynolds term, since like the Einstein
equations they are also of nonlinear hyperbolic type. The expectations of the
randomly perturbed toric radii can be estimated from a cumulant expansion
method. The initially static toroidal vacuum bubble undergoes eternal
'noise-induced' stochastic exponential growth or inflation. Random radial
moduli fields within this scenario therefore act like a 'dark energy'. Finally,
a class of random perturbations is considered for which this Einstein system is
stable.

coherent laser-based upconversion of infrared photons to vacuum-ultraviolet and

notoriously inefficient. In dense nonlinear media, the limiting factor is
strong re-absorption of the generated high-energy photons. Here we overcome
this limitation by allowing high-order harmonics generated from a periodic
array of thin one-dimensional crystalline silicon ridge waveguides to propagate
in the vacuum gaps between the ridges, thereby avoiding the high absorption
loss of the bulk nonlinear material and resulting in a ~ 100-fold increase in
propagation length. As the grating period is varied, each high-harmonic shows a
different and marked modulation, indicating the onset of coherent addition
which is otherwise suppressed in absorption-limited emission. By beating the

constraints, such as functional dependencies. Consistent Query Answering is a
rigorous and principled approach to the semantics of queries posed against
inconsistent databases. The consistent answers to a query on an inconsistent
database is the intersection of the answers to the query on every repair, i.e.,
on every consistent database that differs from the given inconsistent one in a
minimal way. Computing the consistent answers of a fixed conjunctive query on a
given inconsistent database can be a coNP-hard problem, even though every fixed
conjunctive query is efficiently computable on a given consistent database.
  We designed, implemented, and evaluated CAvSAT, a SAT-based system for
consistent query answering. CAvSAT leverages a set of natural reductions from
the complement of consistent query answering to SAT and to Weighted MaxSAT. The
system is capable of handling unions of conjunctive queries and arbitrary
denial constraints, which include functional dependencies as a special case. We
report results from experiments evaluating CAvSAT on both synthetic and
real-world databases. These results provide evidence that a SAT-based approach
can give rise to a comprehensive and scalable system for consistent query
answering.

neuroscience, for adaptive control of continuous-time systems. The proposed
architecture, in the setting of standard Neural Network (NN) based adaptive
control, augments an external working memory to the NN. The controller, through
a write operation, writes the hidden layer feature vector of the NN to the
external working memory and can also update this information with the observed
error in the output. Through a read operation, the controller retrieves
information from the working memory to modify the final control signal. First,
we consider a simpler estimation problem to theoretically study the effect of
an external memory and prove that the estimation accuracy can be improved by
incorporating memory. We then consider a model reference NN adaptive controller
for linear systems with matched uncertainty to implement and illustrate our
ideas. We prove that the resulting controller leads to a Uniformly Bounded (UB)
stable closed loop system. Through extensive simulations and specific metrics,
such as peak deviation and settling time, we show that memory augmentation
improves learning significantly. Importantly, we also provide evidence for and
insights on the mechanism by which this specific memory augmentation improves

the paradigm of run-and-tumble motility is dramatically altered in a porous

characterized by distinct evolutionary stages. In very young systems, the PWN
drives a shock into the innermost supernova (SN) material, giving rise to
low-excitation lines and an infrared (IR) continuum from heated dust grains.
These observational signatures make it possible to cleanly measure the
properties of the deepest SN ejecta layers that can, in turn, provide
constraints on the SN progenitor. We present Herschel Space Observatory far-IR
observations of the PWN in the Galactic SNR Kes 75, containing the youngest
known pulsar that exhibited magnetar-like activity. We detect highly-broadened
oxygen and carbon line emission that arises from the SN ejecta encountered by
the PWN. We also detect a small amount (a few thousandths of a solar mass) of
shock-heated dust that spatially coincides with the ejecta material and was
likely formed in the SN explosion. We use hydrodynamical models to simulate the
evolution of Kes 75 and find that the PWN has so far swept up 0.05-0.1 solar
masses of SN ejecta. Using explosion and nucleosynthesis models for different
progenitor masses in combination with shock models, we compare the predicted
far-IR emission with the observed line intensities and find that lower mass and
explosion energy SN progenitors with mildly mixed ejecta profiles and
comparable abundance fractions of carbon and oxygen are favored over higher
mass ones. We conclude that Kes 75 likely resulted from an 8-12 solar-mass
progenitor, providing further evidence that lower energy explosions of such
progenitors can give rise to magnetars.

Therefore, we use a traditional unsupervised information retrieval system to

relevance between the query and answer can be learned by using QA pairs in a
FAQ database. The recently-proposed BERT model is used for the relevance
calculation. Since the number of QA pairs in FAQ page is not enough to train a

order to achieve high performance visual tracking in various negative

two different deep learning networks: a matching subnetwork and a
classification subnetwork. The matching subnetwork is a fully convolutional
Siamese network. According to the similarity score between the exemplar image
and the candidate image, it aims to search possible object positions and crop
scaled candidate patches. The classification subnetwork is designed to further
evaluate the cropped candidate patches and determine the optimal tracking
results based on the classification score. The matching subnetwork is trained
offline and fixed online, while the classification subnetwork performs
stochastic gradient descent online to learn more target-specific information.
To improve the tracking performance further, an effective classification
subnetwork update method based on both similarity and classification scores is
utilized for updating the classification subnetwork. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance in recent benchmarks.

clusters do not globally synchronize. We use collective coordinates to describe
the inter- and intra-cluster dynamics, which reduces the Kuramoto model to
$2M-1$ degrees of freedom. We show that under some assumptions, there is a
time-scale splitting between the slow intracluster dynamics and fast
intercluster dynamics, which reduces the collective coordinate model to an

clusters are required to yield the three degrees of freedom necessary for

intermittently desynchronizes. We show that this intermittent desynchronization
provides a mechanism for chaos for trimodal natural frequency distributions. In
addition, we use collective coordinates to show analytically that chaos cannot

Westerlund~1, so the magnetar's association with the star cluster is still
secure. For the low dipole field and the large age, recent multiple outbursts

While the roles of microtubules in chromosomal segregation, macromolecular
transport and cell migration are relatively well-understood, studies on the
electrical properties of microtubules have only recently gained strong
interest. Here, we show that while microtubules at physiological concentrations
increase solution capacitance, free tubulin has no appreciable effect. For a
particular microtubule concentration, we were able to quantify these effects by
determining the capacitance and resistance of a single 20 um-long microtubule
to be 1.86 x 10^(-12) F and 1.07 x 10^12 Ohms respectively. Further, we
observed a decrease in electrical resistance of solution, with charge transport
peaking between 20-60 Hz in the presence of microtubules, consistent with
recent findings that microtubules exhibit electric oscillations at such low
frequencies. Our results show that in addition to macromolecular transport,
microtubules also act as charge-storage devices through counterionic
condensation across a broad frequency spectrum. We conclude with a hypothesis
of an electrically-tunable cytoskeleton where the dielectric properties of
tubulin are polymerization-state dependent.

first evidence of quantum nature of thermal light. Further, using the photons
with no common history, we demonstrate post-selected two-photon entanglement
with a state fidelity of 0.826(24), and a violation of Bell's inequality by
2.20(6). The experiment can be further extended to a larger scale using photons

algorithm with forward error correction (FEC) for a point-to-point
communication channel with delayed feedback. AC-RLNC is adaptive to the channel
condition, that the algorithm estimates, and is causal, as coding depends on
the particular erasure realizations, as reflected in the feedback
acknowledgments. Specifically, the proposed model can learn the erasure pattern
of the channel via feedback acknowledgments, and adaptively adjust its
retransmission rates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. By those
adjustments, AC-RLNC achieves the desired delay and throughput, and enables
transmission with zero error probability. We upper bound the throughput and the
mean and maximum in order delivery delay of AC-RLNC, and prove that for the
point to point communication channel in the non-asymptotic regime the proposed
code may achieve more than 90% of the channel capacity. To upper bound the
throughput we utilize the minimum Bhattacharyya distance for the AC-RLNC code.
We validate those results via simulations. We contrast the performance of
AC-RLNC with the one of selective repeat (SR)-ARQ, which is causal but not
adaptive, and is a posteriori. Via a study on experimentally obtained
commercial traces, we demonstrate that a protocol based on AC-RLNC can,
vis-`a-vis SR-ARQ, double the throughput gains, and triple the gain in terms of
mean in order delivery delay when the channel is bursty. Furthermore, the
difference between the maximum and mean in order delivery delay is much smaller
than that of SR-ARQ. Closing the delay gap along with boosting the throughput
is very promising for enabling ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC) applications.

  Storage Systems","14 pages, 17 figures",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to meet the needs of high performance computing (HPC) in terms of
large memory, high throughput and energy savings, the non-volatile memory (NVM)
has been widely studied due to its salient features of high density, near-zero
standby power, byte-addressable and non-volatile properties. In HPC systems,
the multi-level cell (MLC) technique is used to significantly increase device
density and decrease the cost, which however leads to much weaker endurance
than the single-level cell (SLC) counterpart. Although wear-leveling techniques
can mitigate this weakness in MLC, the improvements upon MLC-based NVM become
very limited due to not achieving uniform write distribution before some cells
are really worn out. To address this problem, our paper proposes a
self-adaptive wear-leveling (SAWL) scheme for MLC-based NVM. The idea behind
SAWL is to dynamically tune the wear-leveling granularities and balance the
writes across the cells of entire memory, thus achieving suitable tradeoff
between the lifetime and cache hit rate. Moreover, to reduce the size of the
address-mapping table, SAWL maintains a few recently-accessed mappings in a
small on-chip cache. Experimental results demonstrate that SAWL significantly
improves the NVM lifetime and the performance for HPC systems, compared with
state-of-the-art schemes.

is transferred suddenly from the star's interior to the crust by the collective
unpinning and repinning of large numbers of superfluid vortices. In general,
the pinning potential associated with nuclei in the crustal lattice varies as a
function of radius. We explore vortex dynamics under these conditions by
solving the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in a rotating, harmonic
trap with an axisymmetric `moat' of deeper pinning sites on an otherwise
uniform, corotating pinning grid. The moat is designed to resemble crudely a
radially dependent pinning profile in a neutron star crust, although the values
of the pinning potential are not astrophysically realistic due to computational
constraints. It is shown that vortices accumulate in the moat, inducing large
differential rotation which can trigger mass unpinning events. It is also shown
that the system self-adjusts, such that the net vortex flux out of the system
is the same with and without a moat, as the trap spins down, but glitches are
less frequent and larger when the moat is present. The results, generated for
an idealized system, represent a first step towards including stratified
pinning in quantum mechanical models of neutron star glitches.

The strategy is to examine how system size, or effective Reynolds number,

properties, including intermittency properties of solar wind turbulence. The
expectation based on similar hydrodynamics scalings, is that the kurtosis, of
the small scale magnetic field increments, will increase with increasing

indicate that effective interplanetary turbulence Reynolds number decreases
with increasing heliocentric distance. The decrease of scale-dependent magnetic

continue to much smaller heliocentric distances approaching the Alfven critical

observe increased magnetic field intermittency, stronger current sheets, and
more localized dissipation, as its perihelion approaches the critical regions.

  Prediction","miccai 2019 submission",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Grading breast density is highly sensitive to normalization settings of
digital mammogram as the density is tightly correlated with the distribution of
pixel intensity. Also, the grade varies with readers due to uncertain grading
criteria. These issues are inherent in the density assessment of digital
mammography. They are problematic when designing a computer-aided prediction
model for breast density and become worse if the data comes from multiple
sites. In this paper, we proposed two novel deep learning techniques for breast
density prediction: 1) photometric transformation which adaptively normalizes
the input mammograms, and 2) label distillation which adjusts the label by
using its output prediction. The photometric transformer network predicts
optimal parameters for photometric transformation on the fly, learned jointly
with the main prediction network. The label distillation, a type of
pseudo-label techniques, is intended to mitigate the grading variation. We
experimentally showed that the proposed methods are beneficial in terms of
breast density prediction, resulting in significant performance improvement
compared to various previous approaches.

systems can exhibit real energy eigenvalues, thus ensuring energy conservation
in the temporal average. In optics, PT-symmetry can be readily introduced by
incorporating, in a balanced way, regions having optical gain and loss.
However, all optical realizations have been restricted so far to a single

where radial advection keeps the surface luminosity at the local Eddington
limit, resulting in L(r)~ r^{-2} rather than the r^{-3} expected from the
Novikov-Thorne (standard, sub-Eddington) disc emissivity. Wind losses should
also be important but these are expected to produce a similar radiative
emissivity. We assume that the flow is radially stratified, with an outer
standard disc, an inner hot Comptonising region and an intermediate warm
Comptonising region to produce the soft X-ray excess. This gives the model
enough flexibility to fit the observed data, but with the additional
requirement of energy conservation to give physical constraints. We use this to
fit the broadband spectrum of one of the most extreme Active Galactic Nuclei,
the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 RX J0439.6-5311, which has a black hole mass of (6~9)
times 10^6 solar mass as derived from the H_beta line width. This cannot be fit
with the standard disc emissivity at this mass, as even zero spin models
overproduce the observed luminosity. Instead, we show that the spectrum is well
reproduced by the slim disc model, giving mass accretion rates around (5~10)
times Eddington limit. There is no constraint on black hole spin as the
efficiency is reduced by advection. Such extreme accretion rates should be
characteristic of the first Quasars, and we demonstrate this by fitting to the

such as healthcare, education, and security and defense. A major drawback of
these systems is their lack of generalization across different conditions. This
problem can be solved by training models on large amounts of labeled data from
the target domain, which is expensive and time-consuming. Another approach is
to increase the generalization of the models. An effective way to achieve this
goal is by regularizing the models through multitask learning (MTL), where
auxiliary tasks are learned along with the primary task. These methods often
require the use of labeled data which is computationally expensive to collect
for emotion recognition (gender, speaker identity, age or other emotional
descriptors). This study proposes the use of ladder networks for emotion
recognition, which utilizes an unsupervised auxiliary task. The primary task is
a regression problem to predict emotional attributes. The auxiliary task is the
reconstruction of intermediate feature representations using a denoising
autoencoder. This auxiliary task does not require labels so it is possible to
train the framework in a semi-supervised fashion with abundant unlabeled data
from the target domain. This study shows that the proposed approach creates a
powerful framework for SER, achieving superior performance than fully
supervised single-task learning (STL) and MTL baselines. The approach is
implemented with several acoustic features, showing that ladder networks
generalize significantly better in cross-corpus settings. Compared to the STL
baselines, the proposed approach achieves relative gains in concordance

from the attack signal to the output. The defender improves the resilience of
the system by adding self-feedback loops to certain nodes of the network with
the objective of minimizing the system's $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm. Their decisions

modulating light. It is of great importance to study the nonlinearities induced
by femtosecond laser pulses in LiNbO3. Here, we demonstrate that both Kerr
nonlinearity and Kerr-like nonlinearity induced by terahertz wave occur under
the interaction between laser pulses and LiNbO3 using optical pump-probe
techniques. We show that the contribution of Kerr-like nonlinearity to
pump-probe spectra varies with the interaction length because of the phase
mismatching between terahertz wave and laser pulse. We also observed the
excitation of the low frequency phonon polaritons. Experimental results are in
consistent with theoretical calculation.

human utterances that each refers to a 2D rendering of a 3D CAD model so as to
distinguish it from a set of shape-wise similar alternatives. Using this
dataset, we develop neural language understanding (listening) and production
(speaking) models that vary in their grounding (pure 3D forms via point-clouds
vs. rendered 2D images), the degree of pragmatic reasoning captured (e.g.
speakers that reason about a listener or not), and the neural architecture
(e.g. with or without attention). We find models that perform well with both
synthetic and human partners, and with held out utterances and objects. We also
find that these models are amenable to zero-shot transfer learning to novel
object classes (e.g. transfer from training on chairs to testing on lamps), as
well as to real-world images drawn from furniture catalogs. Lesion studies
indicate that the neural listeners depend heavily on part-related words and
associate these words correctly with visual parts of objects (without any
explicit network training on object parts), and that transfer to novel classes
is most successful when known part-words are available. This work illustrates a
practical approach to language grounding, and provides a case study in the
relationship between object shape and linguistic structure when it comes to
object differentiation.

waves frequently exhibit directional change and subsequently undergo a
topological change; that is, a series of wave dynamics from fusion,
annihilation to splitting. Theoretical studies have shown that excitable planar
stable waves change their topology significantly depending on the initial
conditions on flat surfaces, whereas the directional-change of the waves occurs
based on the geometry of curved surfaces. However, it is not clear if the
geometry of curved surfaces induces this topological change. In this study, we
first show the curved surface geometry-induced topological changes in a planar
stable wave by numerically solving an excitable reaction-diffusion equation on
a bell-shaped surface. We determined two necessary conditions for inducing
topological change: the characteristic length of the curved surface (i.e.,
height of the bell-shaped structure) should be larger than the width of the
wave and than a threshold independent of the wave width. As for the geometrical
mechanism of the latter, we found that a bifurcation of the globally minimum
geodesics (i.e. minimal paths) on the curved surface leads to the topological
change. These conditions imply that wave topology changes can be predicted on
the basis of curved surfaces, whose structure is larger than the wave width.

for the variability in the fitted regression function. Assuming exchangeable
training samples, we prove that this crucial modification permits rigorous
coverage guarantees regardless of the distribution of the data points, for any
algorithm that treats the training points symmetrically. Such guarantees are
not possible for the original jackknife and we demonstrate examples where the
coverage rate may actually vanish. Our theoretical and empirical analysis
reveals that the jackknife and the jackknife+ intervals achieve nearly exact
coverage and have similar lengths whenever the fitting algorithm obeys some
form of stability. Further, we extend the jackknife+ to K-fold cross validation
and similarly establish rigorous coverage properties. Our methods are related
to cross-conformal prediction proposed by Vovk [2015] and we discuss

individual detection events to be processed online, in a parallel manner in
different pixels, while accounting for the intrinsic spatiotemporal structure
of dynamic scenes. Adopting a Bayesian approach, a Bayesian model is
constructed to capture the dynamics of the 3D profile and an approximate
inference scheme based on assumed density filtering is proposed, yielding a
fast and robust reconstruction algorithm able to process efficiently thousands
to millions of frames, as usually recorded using single-photon detectors. The
performance of the proposed method, able to process hundreds of frames per
second, is assessed using a series of experiments conducted with static and
dynamic 3D scenes and the results obtained pave the way to a new family of
real-time 3D reconstruction solutions.

access to a heat bath, thereby viewing the Gibbs state at a fixed temperature
as a free state and hence any other state as a resource. Here, we consider a
multipartite scenario where several parties attempt at extracting work locally,
each having access to a local heat bath (possibly with a different
temperature), assisted with an energy-preserving global unitary. As a specific
model, we analyze a collection of harmonic oscillators or a multimode bosonic
system. Focusing on the Gaussian paradigm, we construct a reasonable resource
theory of local activity for a multimode bosonic system, where we identify as
free any state that is obtained from a product of thermal states (possibly at
different temperatures) acted upon by any linear-optics (passive Gaussian)
transformation. The associated free operations are then all linear-optics
transformations supplemented with tensoring and partial tracing. We show that
the local Gaussian extractable work (if each party applies a Gaussian unitary,
assisted with linear optics) is zero if and only if the covariance matrix of
the system is that of a free state. Further, we develop a resource theory of
local Gaussian extractable work, defined as the difference between the trace
and symplectic trace of the covariance matrix of the system. We prove that it
is a resource monotone that cannot increase under free operations. We also
provide examples illustrating the distillation of local activity and local
Gaussian extractable work.

over the entire angular space is performed while beam indices and the
corresponding peak-to-background ratios of the received power-angle-spectrum

efficient user scheduling algorithm is developed to improve the system spectral
efficiency and to reduce the system misalignment probability. Next, the second
stage of beam search is performed by each RRU with reconfigured search angles,
search steps, and power levels to obtain a refined beam alignment. Simulation

They retain their compact SF size until either further gas accretion restores

the jamming transition as they are compressed or decompressed. To date, sphere
packings have been extensively studied in many previous works, where
isostaticity at the transition and scaling laws with the pressure of various
quantities, including the contact number and the vibrational density of states,
have been established. Additionally, much attention has been paid to
nonspherical packings, and particularly recent work has made progress in
understanding ellipsoidal packings. In the present work, we study the dimer
packings in two dimensions, which have been much less understood than systems
of spheres and ellipsoids. We first study the contact number of dimers near the
jamming transition. It turns out that packings of dimers have ""rotational
rattlers"", each of which still has a free rotational motion. After correcting
this effect, we show that dimers become isostatic at the jamming, and the
excess contact number obeys the same critical law and finite size scaling law
as those of spheres. We next study the vibrational properties of dimers near
the transition. We find that the vibrational density of states of dimers
exhibits two characteristic plateaus that are separated by a peak. The
high-frequency plateau is dominated by the translational degree of freedom,
while the low-frequency plateau is dominated by the rotational degree of
freedom. We establish the critical scaling laws of the characteristic
frequencies of the plateaus and the peak near the transition. In addition, we
present detailed characterizations of the real space displacement fields of
vibrational modes in the translational and rotational plateaus.

NeuroEvolution methods that optimise Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANNs)
only evaluate the candidate solutions for a fixed amount of epochs; this makes
it difficult to effectively assess the learning strategy, and requires the best
generated network to be further trained after evolution. F-DENSER++ enables the
training time of the candidate solutions to grow continuously as necessary,
i.e., in the initial generations the candidate solutions are trained for
shorter times, and as generations proceed it is expected that longer training
cycles enable better performances. Consequently, the models discovered by
F-DENSER++ are fully-trained DANNs, and are ready for deployment after
evolution, without the need for further training. The results demonstrate the
ability of F-DENSER++ to effectively generate fully-trained DANNs; by the end
of evolution, whilst the average performance of the models generated by
F-DENSER++ is of 88.73%, the performance of the models generated by the
previous version of DENSER (Fast-DENSER) is 86.91% (statistically significant),

fixed effects under 'error-covariate' endogeneity, i.e., in the presence of
correlation between the model error and covariates. Our proposal is proved to
be oracle consistent with probability tending to one and works well under most
other type of endogeneity too. Additionally, we also propose and illustrate a
few consistent parameter estimators, including those of the variance
components, along with variable selection through PFGMM. Empirical simulations

uncovering semantic relations between words has the potential to increase the

obstacle is the lack of evaluation benchmark corpora, largely due to the highly

the matter from an Information Retrieval perspective in which referencing texts

estimate the difficulty of benchmark corpus compilation by a novel

investigate to what extent the integration of lexical semantic information

Within the four orders of magnitude change in metallicity, we find that the
haze precursor mass fluxes change only by a factor of $\sim$3. This small
diversity occurs with a non-monotonic manner among the different metallicity
cases, reflecting the interaction of the main atmospheric gases with the
radiation field. Comparison with relative haze yields at different
metallicities from laboratory experiments reveals a qualitative similarity with
our theoretical calculations and highlights the contributions of different gas
precursors. Our haze simulations demonstrate that higher metallicity results
into smaller average particle sizes. Metallicities at and above
100$\times$solar with haze formation yields of $\sim$10$\%$ provide enough haze
opacity to satisfy transit observation at visible wavelengths and obscure
sufficiently the H$_2$O molecular absorption features between 1.1 $\mu$m and
1.7 $\mu$m. However, only the highest metallicity case considered
(10000$\times$solar) brings the simulated spectra into closer agreement with
transit depths at 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m indicating a high contribution of
CO/CO$_2$ in GJ1214b's atmosphere. We also evaluate the impact of aggregate
growth in our simulations, in contrast to spherical growth, and find that the
two growth modes provide similar transit signatures (for D$_f$=2), but with
different particle size distributions. Finally, we conclude that the simulated

fast increase (typically less than 10 s) in intensity over significant length
(several 100s of km) of the existing fibril. For most PMJs, we cannot identify
a clear root or source from where the brightening appears to originate. After
the fast onset, about half of the PMJs have a top that is moving with an
apparent velocity between 5 and 14 km/s, most of them upwards. For the other
PMJs, there is no significant motion of the top. For about a third of the PMJs

associated with the precipitation of a fraction of the dissolved material. We
find three power law regimes for the size of the deposit area as a function of
the initial droplet size, dictated by the competition between evaporation,
diffusion and the initial compound concentrations in the droplet and the thin
film. The strength of the contact line pinning determines the deposition
profile of the precipitate, characterised by a pronounced edge and a linearly
decaying profile towards the centre of the stain. Our predictions for the
concentration profile within the solid substrate resemble patterns found
experimentally.

high-precision pulsar timing experiments, and must be removed in order to
achieve the accuracy needed to detect, e.g., low-frequency gravitational waves.
In current pulsar timing experiments, this delay is usually removed by
approximating the electron density distribution in the Solar wind either as
spherically symmetric, or with a two-phase model that describes the
contributions from both high- and low-speed phases of the Solar wind. However,
no dataset has previously been available to test the performance and
limitations of these models over extended timescales and with sufficient
sensitivity. Here we present the results of such a test with an optimal dataset
of observations of pulsar J0034-0534, taken with the German stations of LOFAR.
We conclude that the spherical approximation performs systematically better
than the two-phase model at almost all angular distances, with a residual
root-mean-square (rms) given by the two-phase model being up to 28% larger than
the result obtained with the spherical approximation. Nevertheless, the
spherical approximation remains insufficiently accurate in modelling the
Solar-wind delay (especially within 20 degrees of angular distance from the
Sun), as it leaves timing residuals with rms values that reach the equivalent
of 0.3 microseconds at 1400 MHz. This is because a spherical model ignores the
large daily variations in electron density observed in the Solar wind. In the
short term, broadband observations or simultaneous observations at low
frequencies are the most promising way forward to correct for Solar-wind
induced delay variations.

through their interactions with ordinary matter. It has been known that their
annihilation inside the NS core causes late-time heating, with which the
surface temperature becomes a constant value of $T_s \simeq (2-3) \times 10^3$
K for the NS age $t \gtrsim 10^{6-7}$ years. This conclusion is, however, drawn
based on the assumption that the beta equilibrium is maintained in NSs
throughout their life, which turns out to be invalid for rotating pulsars. The
slowdown in the pulsar rotation drives the NS matter out of beta equilibrium,
and the resultant imbalance in chemical potentials induces late-time heating,
dubbed as rotochemical heating. This effect can heat a NS up to $T_s \simeq
10^6$ K for $t \simeq 10^{6-7}$ years. In fact, recent observations found
several old NSs whose surface temperature is much higher than the prediction of
the standard cooling scenario and is consistent with the rotochemical heating.
Motivated by these observations, in this letter, we reevaluate the significance
of the DM heating in NSs, including the effect of the rotochemical heating. We
then show that the signature of DM heating can still be detected in old
ordinary pulsars, while it is concealed by the rotochemical heating for old
millisecond pulsars. To confirm the evidence for the DM heating, however, it is
necessary to improve our knowledge on nucleon pairing gaps as well as to
evaluate the initial period of the pulsars accurately. In any cases, a
discovery of a very cold NS can give a robust constraint on the DM heating, and
thus on DM models. To demonstrate this, as an example, we also discuss the case
that the DM is the neutral component of an electroweak multiplet, and show that
an observation of a NS with $T_s \lesssim 10^3$ K imposes a stringent
constraint on such a DM candidate.

UAV that has a time constraint for its operation due to its limited battery,
moves towards the ground nodes to receive status update packets about their

minimum weighted sum for the age-of-information (AoI) values of different

as a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action

scenarios are considered to showcase the convergence of the proposed deep RL

The impact of various system design parameters on the optimal achievable

relies on data-driven representation of multi-shell HARDI data using a bespoke

integrates slice-level outlier rejection, distortion correction, and slice

developing Human Connectome Project (650 scans). Validation experiments
demonstrate accurate slice-level motion correction across the age range and
across the range of motion in the population. Results in the neonatal data show
successful reconstruction even in severely motion-corrupted subjects. In

precision at the level of micro-arcseconds. However, optical distortions have
to be as low as possible to achieve the high demanding astrometry requirements.
In addition to static distortions, the opto-mechanical instabilities cause
astrometric errors that can be major contributors to the astrometry error
budget. The present article describes the analysis, at design level, of the
effects of opto-mechanical instabilities when coupled with optical surface
irregularities due to the manufacturing process. We analyse the notable example

micro-arcseconds astrometric precision once corresponding accuracy is obtained
by both optical design and manufacturing. We predict that for single-epoch
observations, an astrometric error below 50$\mu$as can be achieved for exposure
times up to 2 min, provided about 100 stars are available to remove fifth-order
distortions. Such performance could be reproducible for multi-epoch

of cell crawling involve periodic changes in the cell shape and in the adhesion
characteristics of the cell to the substrate. However, the basic physical
mechanisms by which a single cell coordinates these processes cooperatively to
achieve autonomous migration are not yet well understood. To obtain a clearer

develop a basic mechanochemical model of a crawling cell based on subcellular
elements with the focus on the dependence of the protrusion and contraction as
well as the adhesion and deadhesion processes on intracellular biochemical
signals. By introducing reaction-diffusion equations that reproduce traveling
waves of local chemical concentrations, we clarify that the chemical dependence

broadband penetration goals defined by the National Regulatory Authority. It is
well known that in the absence of regulatory mitigation the population density
has a positive effect on broadband diffusion. Hence, we measure the effect of
the population density on the determinants of broadband diffusion throughout
the postal codes of Finland via Geographically Weighted Regression. We suggest
that the main determinants of broadband diffusion and the population density
follow a spatial pattern that is either concentric with a weak/medium/strong
strength or non-concentric convex/concave. Based on 10 patterns, we argue that
the Finnish spectrum policy encouraged Mobile Network Operators to satisfy
ambitious Universal Service Obligations without the need for a Universal
Service Fund. Spectrum auctions facilitated infrastructure-based competition
via equitable spectrum allocation and coverage obligation delivery via low-fee
licenses. However, state subsidies for fiber deployment did not attract
investment from nationwide operators due to mobile preference. These subsidies
encouraged demand-driven investment, leading to the emergence of fiber consumer
cooperatives. To explain this emergence, we show that when population density
decreases, the level of mobile service quality decreases and community
commitment increases. Hence, we recommend regulators implementing market-driven
strategies for 5G to stimulate local investment. For example, by allocating the
3.5 GHz and higher bands partly through local light licensing.

received an accuracy boost from deep learning approaches, multi-task learning
has mostly been ignored due to a lack of data. New synthetic datasets are being
released, filling this gap with synthetic generated data. In this work, we
analyze four related human analysis tasks in still images in a multi-task
scenario by leveraging such datasets. Specifically, we study the correlation of
2D/3D pose estimation, body part segmentation and full-body depth estimation.
These tasks are learned via the well-known Stacked Hourglass module such that
each of the task-specific streams shares information with the others. The main
goal is to analyze how training together these four related tasks can benefit
each individual task for a better generalization. Results on the newly released
SURREAL dataset show that all four tasks benefit from the multi-task approach,
but with different combinations of tasks: while combining all four tasks
improves 2D pose estimation the most, 2D pose improves neither 3D pose nor
full-body depth estimation. On the other hand 2D parts segmentation can benefit
from 2D pose but not from 3D pose. In all cases, as expected, the maximum
improvement is achieved on those human body parts that show more variability in
terms of spatial distribution, appearance and shape, e.g. wrists and ankles.

species, such as humans or resident killer whales, and its origin is under
debate. Hypotheses like mother-care and grandmother-care invoke strategies of
investment--provision to one's descendants to enhance one's overall
reproductive success--to explain PRLS. The contribution of an investment
strategy varies with the age of the caregiver, as the number of care-receiving
descendant changes with age. Here we simulated an agent based model, which is
sensitive to age-specific selection, to examine how the investment strategies
in different hypotheses affect survival and reproduction across different
stages of life. We found that extensive PRLS emerges if we combine multiple
investment strategies, including grandmother-care but not mother-care, which
allow an individual to have an increasing contribution as it ages. We also
found that, if mother-care is further introduced to the PRLS-enabling
strategies, it will let contribution at mid-life to substitute contribution at
late life, which consequently terminates extensive PRLS.

in the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of compressible isotropic turbulence
up to the supersonic regime. With the consideration of robustness and accuracy,
the WENO-Z scheme is adopted for spatial reconstruction in the current
higher-order scheme. Statistical quantities are compared with the high-order
compact finite difference scheme to determine the spatial and temporal
criterion for DNS. According to the grid and time convergence study, it can be
concluded that the minimum spatial resolution parameter $\kappa_{max} \eta_0
\ge 2.71$ and the maximum temporal resolution parameter $\Delta
t_{ini}/\tau_{t_0} \leq 5.58/1000$ are adequate for HGKS to resolve the
compressible isotropic turbulence, where $\kappa_{max}$ is the maximum resolved
wave number, $\Delta t_{ini}$ is the initial time step, $\eta_0$ and
$\tau_{t_0}$ are the initial Kolmogorov length scale and the
large-eddy-turnover time. Guided by such criterion, the compressible isotropic
turbulence from subsonic regime $Ma_t=0.8$ to supersonic one $Ma_t=1.2$, and
the Taylor microscale Reynolds number $Re_{\lambda}$ ranging from $10$ to $72$
are simulated. With the high initial turbulent Mach number, the strong random
shocklets and high expansion regions are identified, as well as the wide range
of probability density function over local turbulence Mach number. All those
impose great challenge for high-order schemes. In order to construct
compressible large eddy simulation models at high turbulent Mach number, the
ensemble budget of turbulent kinetic energy is fully analyzed. The solenoidal
dissipation rate decreases with the increasing of $Ma_t$ and $Re_{\lambda}$.
Meanwhile, the dilational dissipation rate increases with the increasing of
$Ma_t$, which cannot be neglected for constructing supersonic turbulence model.

sharp contrast with classical information theory where, according to Shannon,
the secret key needs to be at least as long as the message. Here we explore
photonic architectures for quantum data locking, where information is encoded
in multi-photon states and processed using multi-mode linear optics and
photo-detection, with the goal of extending an initial secret key into a longer
one. % The secret key consumption depends on the number of modes and photons
employed. In the no-collision limit, where the likelihood of photon bunching is
suppressed, the key consumption is shown to be logarithmic in the dimensions of
the system. Our protocol can be viewed as an application of the physics of

perihelion, the OSIRIS and VIRTIS-M instruments on Rosetta observed the
evolving dust and gas coma during a complete rotation of the comet. We aim to
characterize the dust, H2O and CO2 gas spatial distribution in the inner coma.
To do this we performed a quantitative analysis of the release of dust and gas
and compared the observed H2O production rate with the one calculated using a
thermo-physical model. For this study we selected OSIRIS WAC images at 612 nm
(dust) and VIRTIS-M image cubes at 612 nm, 2700 nm (H2O) and 4200 nm (CO2). We
measured the average signal in a circular annulus, to study spatial variation
around the comet, and in a sector of the annulus, to study temporal variation
in the sunward direction with comet rotation, both at a fixed distance of 3.1
km from the comet centre. The spatial correlation between dust and water, both
coming from the sun-lit side of the comet, shows that water is the main driver
of dust activity in this time period. The spatial distribution of CO2 is not
correlated with water and dust. There is no strong temporal correlation between
the dust brightness and water production rate as the comet rotates. The dust
brightness shows a peak at 0deg sub-solar longitude, which is not pronounced in
the water production. At the same epoch, there is also a maximum in CO2
production. An excess of measured water production, with respect to the value
calculated using a simple thermo-physical model, is observed when the head lobe
and regions of the Southern hemisphere with strong seasonal variations are
illuminated. A drastic decrease in dust production, when the water production
(both measured and from the model) displays a maximum, happens when typical
Northern consolidated regions are illuminated and the Southern hemisphere
regions with strong seasonal variations are instead in shadow.

matrix acquired in a time-consuming calibration measurement. The calibration
approach has the important advantage over model-based reconstruction that it
takes the complex particle physics as well as system imperfections into
account. This benefit comes for the cost that the system matrix needs to be
re-calibrated whenever the scan parameters, particle types or even the particle
environment (e.g. viscosity or temperature) changes. One route for reducing the
calibration time is the sampling of the system matrix at a subset of the
spatial positions of the intended field-of-view and employing system matrix
recovery. Recent approaches used compressed sensing (CS) and achieved
subsampling factors up to 28 that still allowed reconstructing MPI images of
sufficient quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework with a 3d-System
Matrix Recovery Network and demonstrate it to recover a 3d system matrix with a
subsampling factor of 64 in less than one minute and to outperform CS in terms
of system matrix quality, reconstructed image quality, and processing time. The
advantage of our method is demonstrated by reconstructing open access MPI
datasets. The model is further shown to be capable of inferring system matrices
for different particle types.

formation of rocky planetesimals. In this study, we examine the possibility
that silicate grains with an organic mantle, which we call Organic-Mantled
Grains (OMGs), form planetesimals through direct coagulation. Organic mantles
are commonly found in interplanetary dust particles, and laboratory experiments
show that they are softer than silicates, in particular in warm environments.
This, combined with the theory of particle adhesion, implies that OMGs are
stickier than bare silicate grains. Because organic mantles can survive up to
400 K, silicate grains inside the water snow line in protoplanetary disks can
in principle hold such mantles. We construct a simple grain adhesion model to
estimate the threshold collision velocity below which aggregates of OMGs can
grow. The model shows that aggregates of 0.1 \micron-sized OMGs can overcome
the fragmentation barrier in protoplanetary disks if the mantles are as thick
as those in interplanetary dust particles and if the temperature is above
$\sim$ 200 K. We use this adhesion model to simulate the global evolution of
OMG aggregates in the inner part of a protoplanetary disk, demonstrating that
OMG aggregates can indeed grow into planetesimals under favorable conditions.
Because organic matter is unstable at excessively high temperatures, rocky
planetesimal formation by the direct sticking of OMGs is expected to occur in a
disk annulus corresponding to the temperature range $ \sim$ 200--400 K. The
organic-rich planetesimals may grow into carbon-poor rocky planetesimals by
accreting a large amount of carbon-poor chondrules.

$G'$ is quasi-isometric to $G$, it contains an almost normal subgroup $H'$ that

quasi-isometric. This generalises a theorem of Mosher-Sageev-Whyte, who prove
the case in which $G/H$ is quasi-isometric to a finite valence bushy tree.
Using work of Mosher, we generalise a result of Farb-Mosher to show that for
many surface group extensions $\Gamma_L$, any group quasi-isometric to

In order to explore the YSO population of the Milky Way, we combined the $Gaia$
DR2 database with WISE and Planck measurements and made an all-sky
probabilistic catalogue of YSOs using machine learning techniques, such as
Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or Neural Networks. Our input
catalogue contains 103 million objects from the DR2xAllWISE cross-match table.
We classified each object into four main classes: YSOs, extragalactic objects,
main-sequence stars and evolved stars. At a 90% probability threshold we
identified 1,129,295 YSO candidates. To demonstrate the quality and potential
of our YSO catalogue, here we present two applications of it. (1) We explore
the 3D structure of the Orion A star forming complex and show that the spatial
distribution of the YSOs classified by our procedure is in agreement with
recent results from the literature. (2) We use our catalogue to classify
published $Gaia$ Science Alerts. As $Gaia$ measures the sources at multiple
epochs, it can efficiently discover transient events, including sudden
brightness changes of YSOs caused by dynamic processes of their circumstellar
disk. However, in many cases the physical nature of the published alert sources
are not known. A cross-check with our new catalogue shows that about 30% more
of the published $Gaia$ alerts can most likely be attributed to YSO activity.
The catalogue can be also useful to identify YSOs among future $Gaia$ alerts.

cellular networks often exhibit an inadequate performance for aerial users due
to high amounts of intercell interference. Furthermore, taking the never-ending
trend of densification into account, the level of interference experienced by
UAVs will only increase in the future. For the purpose of UAV trajectory
planning, wireless coverage should be taken into account to mitigate
interference and to lower the risk of dangerous connectivity outages. In this
paper, several path planning strategies are proposed and evaluated to optimise
wireless coverage for UAVs. A simulator using a real-life 3D map is used to
evaluate the proposed algorithms for both 4G and 5G scenarios. We show that the
proposed Coverage-Aware A* algorithm, which alters the UAV's flying altitude,
is able to improve the mean SINR by 3-4dB and lower the cellular outage

Currently, the highest performing algorithms for object detection from LiDAR

supervised learning requires large annotated datasets. Therefore, most research
using neural networks for object detection from LiDAR point clouds is conducted
on a very small number of publicly available datasets. Consequently, only a
small number of sensor types are used. We use an existing annotated dataset to
train a neural network that can be used with a LiDAR sensor that has a lower
resolution than the one used for recording the annotated dataset. This is done
by simulating data from the lower resolution LiDAR sensor based on the higher

To set the stage we first map out the phase diagram for the trapped system by
making use of a, so-called, continuous-time Nesterov method. We present an
extension of the method, which has been previously applied to one-component
systems, to our multi-component system. We show that it is a powerful and
robust tool for finding the ground states of a physical system without the need
of an accurate initial guess. We subsequently solve numerically the Bogoliubov
de-Gennes equations in order to analyze the stability of the ground states of
the trapped spin-1 system. We find that the trapping potential retains the
overall structure of the stability diagram, while affecting the spectral
details of each of the possible ground state waveforms. It is also found that
the peak density of the trapped system is the characteristic quantity
describing dynamical instabilities in the system. Therefore replacing the
homogeneous density with the peak density of the trapped system leads to good
agreement of the homogeneous Bogoliubov predictions with the numerically
observed maximal growth rates of dynamically unstable modes. The stability
conclusions in the one-dimensional trapped system are independent of the spin
coupling strength and the normalized trap strength over several orders of
magnitude of their variation.

graph properties in which, in addition to answers to the usual graph-queries,
the tester obtains {\em random vertices drawn according to an arbitrary
distribution $D$}. Such a tester is required to distinguish between graphs that
have the property and graphs that are far from having the property, {\em where
the distance between graphs is defined based on the unknown vertex distribution
$D$}. These (""vertex-distribution free"" (VDF)) models generalize the standard
models in which $D$ is postulated to be uniform on the vertex-set, and they
were studies both in the dense graph model and in the bounded-degree graph
model.
  The focus of the aforementioned work was on testers, called {\sf strong},
whose query complexity depends only on the proximity parameter $\epsilon$.
Unfortunately, in the standard bounded-degree graph model, some natural
properties such as Bipartiteness do not have strong testers, and others (like
cycle-freeness) do not have strong testers of one-sided error (whereas
one-sided error was shown inherent to the VDF model). Hence, it was suggested
to study general (i.e., non-strong) testers of ""sub-linear"" complexity.
  In this work, we pursue the foregoing suggestion, but do so in a model that
augments the model presented in the aforementioned work. Specifically, we
provide the tester with an evaluation oracle to the unknown distribution $D$,
in addition to samples of $D$ and oracle access to the tested graph. Our main
results are testers for Bipartitness and cycle-freeness, in this augmented
model, having complexity that is almost-linear in the square root of the

fluctuation as a function of the applied electric field to the sample. We also
observe the coexistence of in-plane and out of plane magnetization in Pt/Co/Pt
heterostructures in a region around the spin reorientation transition whose
formation is attributed to substrate surface roughness comparable to the film
thickness; with such domain configuration, we find that the in-plane
magnetization is more sensitive to the applied electric field than out of plane
magnetization. Although we find an effective magnetoelectric coupling in our
system, the presence of charge defects in the silicon nitride membranes hampers
a systematic electrostatic control of the magnetization.

an understanding of the scaling and finite-size properties of fractal
dimensions is essential. We present such a study for random matrix ensembles,
and compare with two chaotic quantum systems --- the kicked rotor and a spin
chain. For random matrix ensembles we analytically obtain the finite-size
dependence of the mean behavior of the multifractal dimensions, which provides
a lower bound to the typical (logarithmic) averages. We show that finite
statistics has remarkably strong effects, so that even random matrix
computations deviate from analytic results (and show strong sample-to-sample
variation), such that restoring agreement requires exponentially large sample
sizes. For the quantized standard map (kicked rotor) the multifractal
dimensions are found to follow the random matrix predictions closely, with the
same finite statistics effects. For a XXZ spin-chain we find significant
deviations from the random matrix prediction --- the large-size scaling follows
a system-specific path towards unity. This suggests that local many-body
Hamiltonians are ""weakly ergodic"", in the sense that their eigenfunction

In this article, we study potential biases inherent to current tidal waveform
approximants for spinning and precessing systems. We perform a Bayesian study
to estimate intrinsic parameters of highly spinning binary neutron star
systems. Our analysis shows that one has to include the quadrupolar deformation
of the neutron stars due to their rotation once dimensionless spins above $\chi
\sim 0.20$ are reached, otherwise the extracted intrinsic parameters are
systematically biased. We find that at design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and
Virgo, it seems unlikely that for GW170817-like sources a clear imprint of
precession will be visible in the analysis of the signal employing current
waveform models. However, precession effects might be detectable for unequal
mass configurations with spins larger than $\chi>0.2$. We finalize our study by
investigating possible benefits of a combined gravitational wave and
electromagnetic detection. The presence of electromagnetic counterparts help in
reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space with constraints on the sky
location, source distance, and inclination. However, we note that although a
small improvement in the estimation of the tidal deformability parameter is
seen in these cases, changes in the intrinsic parameters are overall very
small.

Enhanced Lateral Drift (ELAD) sensor. In ELAD sensors the spatial resolution of
the impact position of ionising particles is improved by a dedicated charge
sharing mechanism, which is achieved by a non-homogeneous electric field in the
lateral direction in the sensor bulk. The non-homogeneous electric field is
created by buried doping implants with a higher concentration with respect to
the background concentration of the bulk. The resulting position-dependent
charge sharing allows for an improved interpolation of the impact position.
TCAD-based electric field simulations for 2D and 3D geometries as well as
transient simulations with a traversing particle for the 2D geometry have been
carried out. The electric field profiles have further been optimised for
position resolution. The simulations show a strong dependence of the charge
sharing mechanism on the buried implant concentration. Optimal values for the
buried implant concentration allow for nearly linear charge sharing between two
readout electrodes as a function of the impact position. Additionally, the
foreseen production technique combining silicon epitaxy and ion beam

levels of faculty expertise, and different disciplines (such as Math, computer
science, and business etc) in developing the curriculum. The University of
Massachusetts Dartmouth started offering degree programs in data science from
Fall 2015, at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Quite a few
articles have been published that deal with graduate data science courses, much
less so dealing with undergraduate ones. Our discussion will focus on
undergraduate course structure and function, and specifically, a first course
in data science. Our design of this course centers around a concept called the
data science life cycle. That is, we view tasks or steps in the practice of
data science as forming a process, consisting of states that indicate how it
comes into life, how different tasks in data science depend on or interact with
others until the birth of a data product or the reach of a conclusion.
Naturally, different pieces of the data science life cycle then form individual
parts of the course. Details of each piece are filled up by concepts,
techniques, or skills that are popular in industry. Consequently, the design of
our course is both ""principled"" and practical. A significant feature of our
course philosophy is that, in line with activity theory, the course is based on
the use of tools to transform real data in order to answer strongly motivated
questions related to the data.

reward function is nonlinear. In this setting, the agent chooses a batch of
arms on each round and receives feedback from each arm of the batch. The reward
that the agent aims to maximize is a function of the selected arms and their
expectations. In many applications, the reward function is highly nonlinear,
and the performance of existing algorithms relies on a global Lipschitz
constant to encapsulate the function's nonlinearity. This may lead to loose
regret bounds, since by itself, a large gradient does not necessarily cause a
large regret, but only in regions where the uncertainty in the reward's
parameters is high. To overcome this problem, we introduce a new smoothness
criterion, which we term \emph{Gini-weighted smoothness}, that takes into
account both the nonlinearity of the reward and concentration properties of the
arms. We show that a linear dependence of the regret in the batch size in
existing algorithms can be replaced by this smoothness parameter. This, in
turn, leads to much tighter regret bounds when the smoothness parameter is
batch-size independent. For example, in the probabilistic maximum coverage
(PMC) problem, that has many applications, including influence maximization,
diverse recommendations and more, we achieve dramatic improvements in the upper
bounds. We also prove matching lower bounds for the PMC problem and show that
our algorithm is tight, up to a logarithmic factor in the problem's parameters.

out by a boundary-driven Lindblad dynamics as well as unitary dynamics, with
agreeing diffusion constants. This must be contrasted to random potential where
transport is subdiffusive at such small interactions. Mean-field treatment of
the dynamics for small U always slows down the non-interacting dynamics to
subdiffusion, and is therefore unable to describe diffusion in an interacting

and $B$ such that each vertex has at most one neighbor in the other side of the
cut. The MATCHING CUT problem asks whether a graph has a matching cut, and has
been intensively studied in the literature. Motivated by a question posed by
Komusiewicz et al. [IPEC 2018], we introduce a natural generalization of this
problem, which we call $d$-CUT: for a positive integer $d$, a $d$-cut is a
bipartition of the vertex set of a graph into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that
each vertex has at most $d$ neighbors across the cut. We generalize (and in
some cases, improve) a number of results for the MATCHING CUT problem. Namely,
we begin with an NP-hardness reduction for $d$-CUT on $(2d+2)$-regular graphs
and a polynomial algorithm for graphs of maximum degree at most $d+2$. The
degree bound in the hardness result is unlikely to be improved, as it would
disprove a long-standing conjecture in the context of internal partitions. We
then give FPT algorithms for several parameters: the maximum number of edges
crossing the cut, treewidth, distance to cluster, and distance to co-cluster.
In particular, the treewidth algorithm improves upon the running time of the
best known algorithm for MATCHING CUT. Our main technical contribution,
building on the techniques of Komusiewicz et al. [IPEC 2018], is a polynomial
kernel for $d$-CUT for every positive integer $d$, parameterized by the
distance to a cluster graph. We also rule out the existence of polynomial
kernels when parameterizing simultaneously by the number of edges crossing the
cut, the treewidth, and the maximum degree. Finally, we provide an exact
exponential algorithm slightly faster than the naive brute force approach
running in time $O^*(2^n)$.

statistics. It encodes the existence of a ""big data"" regime where the number of

Distributed Gradient Descent achieves optimal statistical rates with the same
order of iterations as gradient descent run with all the samples in the

J-PLUS is a multiband survey carried out with the wide angle T80Cam optical

Release (IDR) covering 528 deg$^2$. We complement J-PLUS photometry with other
catalogues in the optical and IR using VOSA, a VO tool that estimates physical
parameters from the spectral energy distribution fitting to collections of
theoretical models. Objects identified as UCDs are distinguished from
background M giants and highly reddened stars using parallaxes and proper
motions from Gaia DR2. We identify 559 UCDs, ranging from i=16.2 to 22.4 mag,
of which 187 are candidate UCDs not previously reported in the literature. This
represents an increase in the number of known UCDs of about 50% in the studied
region of the sky, particularly at the faint end of our sensitivity, which is
interesting as reference for future wide and deep surveys such as Euclid. Three
candidates constitute interesting targets for exoplanet surveys because of
their proximity (<40 pc). We also analyze the kinematics of UCDs in our
catalogue and find evidence that it is consistent with a Galactic thin-disk
population, except for 6 objects that might be members of the thick disk. The
results obtained validate the proposed methodology, which will be used in

lattice subject to exclusion interactions, which move and collide
stochastically with energy-dependent rates. The resulting fluctuating
hydrodynamics equations exhibit nonlinear coupled particle and energy
transport, including particle currents due to temperature gradients (Soret
effect) and energy flow due to concentration gradients (Dufour effect). The
microscopic dynamical complexity is condensed in just two matrices of transport
coefficients: the diffusivity matrix (or equivalently the Onsager matrix)
generalizing Fick-Fourier's law, and the mobility matrix controlling current
fluctuations. Both transport coefficients are coupled via a
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, suggesting that the noise terms affecting the
local currents have Gaussian properties. We further prove the positivity of
entropy production in terms of the microscopic dynamics. The so-called kinetic
exclusion process has as limiting cases two of the most paradigmatic models of
nonequilibrium physics, namely the symmetric simple exclusion process of
particle diffusion and the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model of heat flow, making
it the ideal testbed where to further develop modern theories of nonequilibrium

to the non-ideal MHD effects arising from the low ionization fraction of the
disk gas. A strong electric field induced by gas motions can heat ionized gas
particles and can thereby affect the ionization balance in the disks. Our
previous studies revealed that in dusty protoplanetary disks, the Ohmic
conductivity decreases with increasing electric field strength until the
electrical breakdown of the disk gas occurs. In this study, we extend our
previous work to more general cases where both electric and magnetic fields
affect the motion of plasma particles, allowing us to study the impacts of
plasma heating on all non-ideal MHD effects: Ohmic, Hall, and ambipolar
diffusion. We find that the upper limit on the electric current we previously
derived applies even in the presence of magnetic fields. Although the Hall and
ambipolar resistivities can either increase or decrease with electric field
strength depending on the abundance of charged dust grains, the Ohmic
resistivity always increases with electric field strength. An
order-of-magnitude estimate suggests that a large-scale electric current
generated by gas motions in the inner part of protoplanetary disks could exceed
the upper limit. This implies that MHD motions of the inner disk, such as the
motion driven by the Hall-shear instability, could either get suppressed or
trigger electrical breakdown (lightning discharge). This may have important
implications for gas accretion and chondrule formation in the inner part of
protoplanetary disks.

whose brightest member is an O9.5V star, CPD-59 2661. The emission of the [CII]
and [OI] lines peak at a position close to the embedded star, while all other
tracers peak at another position lying to the north-east consistent with gas
being compressed by the expanding PDR created by the embedded cluster. The
molecular gas inside the globule is probed with the J=2-1 transitions of CO and
isotopologues as well as H2CO, and analyzed using a non-LTE model
(escape-probability approach), while we use PDR models to derive the physical
conditions of the PDR. We identify at least two PDR gas components; the diffuse
part (~10^4 cm^-3) is traced by [CII], while the dense (n~ 2-8x10^5 cm^-3) part
is traced by [CII], [OI], CO(11-10). Using the F=2-1 transition of [13CII]
detected at 50 positions in the region, we derive optical depths (0.9-5),
excitation temperatures of [CII] (80-255 K), and N(C+) of 0.3-1x10^19 cm^-2.
The total mass of the globule is ~1000 Msun, about half of which is traced by
[CII]. The dense PDR gas has a thermal pressure of 10^7-10^8 K cm^-3, which is
similar to the values observed in other regions.

that all nonlinear terms can be treated semi-implicitly and the resultant

in details. We have analytically derived the conditions for the edge states for
a bilayer KM nanoribbon and show how these modes decay for lattice sites inside

an even number of zigzag ribbon hosts a finite energy gap at the Dirac points,
while the odd ones do not. This asymmetry is present both in presence and
absence of a bias voltage that may exist between the layers. The interlayer
Rashba spin-orbit coupling, along with the intralayer intrinsic spin-orbit and
intralayer Rashba spin-orbit couplings seem to destroy the quantum spin Hall
(QSH) phase where the QSH phase is identified by the presence of a conductance
plateau (of magnitude 4e/h) in the vicinity of zero Fermi energy. The plateau
is sensitive to the values of the spin-orbit coupling parameters. Further, the
spin polarized conductance data reveal that a bilayer KM ribbon is found to be
more efficient for spintronic applications compared to a monolayer graphene.

mass towards the body's center, hence providing valuable additional information
about the internal structure. When hydrostatic equilibrium is assumed for the
planetary interior, $k_2$ is a direct function of the planetary shape. Previous

illustrate the feasibility of our method and show, by applying a Differential
Evolution Markov Chain to synthetic data of WASP-121b, that a precision $\leq$
65 ppm/$\sqrt{2\,min}$ is required to reliably retrieve $k_2$ with present

where the flow stable (Re < 47). Although the training data can be fitted well
with both methods, the linear Volterra method requires a higher model order
than the ARX model for the same accuracy. Comparison of the frequency response
indicates that the ARX model approximates the frequency response more closely,
while the frequency response at high Reynolds number is over-fitted by Volterra
series. The second aerodynamic system is a flow over a pitching NACA0012
airfoil, including subsonic and transonic states. The convergence of the model
with respect to delay orders, at different Mach numbers and mean angles of
attack, is studied in detail. As the Mach number or the mean angle of attack
increases, the required delay order will increase. But the ARX model still
models this system with a small number of terms at the same level of accuracy.
All results indicate that the ARX model outperforms the linear Volterra series
in most of cases, especially when the flow is close to the unstable state.

orbits around stellar binaries. We build on the coplanar three-body system of
the Dvorak(1986), extending his stability diagram to both corotation and
counter rotation of P-type orbits. His stability diagram express the change of
stability across the gap between upper(UCO) and lower(LCO) critical orbits. By
radius, this gap has a width of about 8$\%$ in the corotation case and 24$\%$
in the counter rotation case. As the gap of the second lies below the first,
counter rotation is more stable, yet by width it is more chaotic. The gap
between UCO and LCO follows a transition radius $r^+_g = 2.39 + 2.53e - 1.40
e^2$ and $r^-_g = 0.92 - 2.47e$ for corotation and respectively, counter
rotation of the third body (the planet). Our $r^+_g$ agrees with the same of
Dvorak to within 0.35$\%$. As a result, we discover $r^+_g/r^-_g \lesssim 2.57$
for all $e$. Around dim binaries, therefore, a relatively close in habitable
zone may still be populated with planets on counter rotating orbits. The
accurate numerical results presented here based on adaptive integration using

different invasion probabilities between and within these groups, which results
in a tunable intensity of bidirectional invasion among peer species. Our study
reveals an exceptional richness of pattern formations where five quantitatively
different phases are observed by varying solely the strength of the mentioned

of appropriate order parameters based on the spatial autocorrelation decay, on
the fraction of empty sites, and on the variance of the species density.
Furthermore, the application of diverse, alliance-specific inner invasion rates
for different groups may result in the extinction of the pair of species where
this inner invasion is moderate. These observations highlight that beyond the
well-known and intensively studied cyclic dominance there is an additional
source of complexity of pattern formation that has not been explored earlier.

is often solved by reconstructing data in large clusters of GPUs with enough
devices to fit the measured X-ray projections and reconstructed volume. Often
this requires tens of GPUs, which is a very economically expensive solution.
Access to single-node machines designed to reconstruct using just one or a few
GPUs is more common in the field, but current software does not allow iterative
reconstruction of volumes that do not fit in those GPUs. In this work, we
propose a strategy to execute efficiently the required operations for iterative
reconstruction for arbitrarily large images with any number of GPUs with
arbitrarily small memories in a single node. Strategies for both the forward
and backprojection operators are presented, along with two regularization
approaches that are easily generalized to other projection types or
regularizers. The proposed improvement also accelerates reconstruction of
smaller images on single or multiple GPUs, providing faster code for
time-critical medical applications. The resulting algorithm has been added to

emergence of divergent delivered services, where service selection is meritedly
required to obtain the target service fulfilling the requirements from both

handled the issue of service selection, it remains an open question in the case
where requests from multiple users are performed simultaneously by a certain
set of shared candidate services. Meanwhile, there exist some constraints
enforced on the context of service selection, e.g. service placement location
and contracts between users and service providers. In this paper, we focus on
the QoS-aware service selection with constraints from a fairness aspect, with
the objective of achieving max-min fairness across multiple service requests
sharing candidate service sets. To be more specific, we study the problem of
fairly selecting services from shared candidate sets while service providers
are self-motivated to offer better services with higher QoS values. We
formulate this problem as a lexicographical maximization problem, which is far
from trivial to deal with practically due to its inherently multi-objective and
discrete nature. A fairness-aware algorithm for concurrent service selection
(FASS) is proposed, whose basic idea is to iteratively solve the
single-objective subproblems by transforming them into linear programming
problems. Experimental results based on real-world datasets also validate the
effectiveness and practicality of our proposed approach.

producers to individual households. The future smart grid provides the
technology for this. In this paper, a novel demand-side management concept is
proposed. It is implemented by a utility company which focuses on renewable
energy. Through a specific billing mechanism, prosumers are encouraged to
balance load and supply. A game-theoretic approach models households as
self-determined rational energy users that want to reduce their individual
electricity costs. To achieve this, they selfishly share energy with their
neighbours and also schedule their energy storage systems. The scheme is
designed such that monetary transactions between households are not necessary.
Thus, it provides an alternative approach to energy trading schemes from the

people from other living things and enable people to communicate each other.
Language is a tool that enables people to express their feelings and thoughts
and to transfers cultures through generations. Texts and audio are examples of
natural language in daily life. In the natural language, many words disappear
in time, on the other hand new words are derived. Therefore, while the process
of natural language processing (NLP) is complex even for human, it is difficult
to process in computer system. The area of linguistics examines how people use
language. NLP, which requires the collaboration of linguists and computer
scientists, plays an important role in human computer interaction. Studies in
NLP have increased with the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the
field of linguistics. With the deep learning methods which are one of the
artificial intelligence study areas, platforms close to natural language are
being developed. Developed platforms for language comprehension, machine
translation and part of speech (POS) tagging benefit from deep learning
methods. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), one of the deep learning
architectures, is preferred for processing sequential data such as text or
audio data. In this study, Turkish POS tagging model has been proposed by using
Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) which is an RNN type. The proposed
POS tagging model is provided to natural language researchers with a platform
that allows them to perform and use their own analysis. In the development
phase of the platform developed by using BLSTM, the error rate of the POS
tagger has been reduced by taking feedback with expert opinion.

focused on the development of highly selective single-target drugs. Nowadays

There are several approaches to discover new drugs targets, as analysis of
genome wide association, gene expression data and networks, structural

has experienced a rapid increase in development which is mainly due to the
increasing cost for discovering new compounds. Since drug development is a very
costly venture, the pharmaceutical industry puts effort in the repositioning of

  implicit schemes","38 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CE physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper presents novel results, obtained on the basis of the modified
theory of hydraulic fractures (HF). The theory underlines significance of the
speed equation. When applied to numerical simulation of HF, the theory reveals
three distinct issues: (i) modeling the central part of a HF; (ii) modeling the
near-front zone; and (iii) tracing changes in the shape of a fracture contour.
Modeling the central part leads to a stiff system of ODE in time, what strongly
complicates its integration. For explicit schemes, it requires small time steps
to meet the CFL condition. For implicit schemes, it requires proper
preconditioners. The gains and flaws of the two strategies are discussed. It is
noted that a rough spatial mesh may be used in the central part. Modeling the
near-front zone reveals the vital role of the speed equation for HF modeling by
any method. Its asymptotic analysis has resulted in the fundamental concept of
the universal asymptotic umbrella. For the near-front zone, it is also
established that a notable part of the zone adjacent to the front propagates
virtually as a simple wave. This implies that the CFL condition of stability
for this zone is much less restrictive than for the central part of the
fracture. Of essence is also that the wave-like propagation of the near front
zone makes preferable upwind schemes of time stepping. On whole, the analysis
implies that explicit time stepping may be complementing, competitive and even
superior over implicit integration. Tracing changes in the front shape appears
merely in 3D problems when the contour changes its form. The problem, being
essentially geometrical, it may be solved separately by various methods,
including fast marching, level set and the simplest string/marker methods. In
1D cases, it does not arise at all.
  Quantitative estimations and numerical examples illustrate the theoretical
conclusions.

hindered the application of the canonical version of the method to larger
systems and/or with larger basis sets. We assessed the accuracy of the
approximation using two systems: tetramethyleneethane (TME) and oxo-Mn(Salen).
Using the default cut-off parameters, we were able to recover over 99.7% and
99.8% of canonical correlation energy for the triplet and singlet state of TME
respectively. In case of oxo-Mn(Salen), we found out that the amount of

these calculations up to quadruple-$\zeta$ basis set amounting to 1178 basis
