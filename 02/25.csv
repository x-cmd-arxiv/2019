edge has a latency and a capacity, along with the weight. Edge latencies
capture the delay on the links of the communication network, while capacity
captures their throughput (in this case, the rate at which messages can be
sent). Depending on how the edge latencies relate to the edge weights, we
provide several tight bounds on the time and messages required to construct an
MST.
  When edge weights exactly correspond with the latencies, we show that,
perhaps interestingly, the bottleneck parameter in determining the running time
of an algorithm is the total weight $W$ of the MST (rather than the total
number of nodes $n$, as in the standard CONGEST model). That is, we show a
tight bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(D + \sqrt{W/c})$ rounds, where $D$ refers to the
latency diameter of the graph, $W$ refers to the total weight of the
constructed MST and edges have capacity $c$. The proposed algorithm sends
$\tilde{O}(m+W)$ messages, where $m$, the total number of edges in the network
graph under consideration, is a known lower bound on message complexity for MST
construction. We also show that $\Omega(W)$ is a lower bound for fast MST
constructions.
  When the edge latencies and the corresponding edge weights are unrelated, and
either can take arbitrary values, we show that (unlike the sub-linear time
algorithms in the standard CONGEST model, on small diameter graphs), the best
time complexity that can be achieved is $\tilde{\Theta}(D+n/c)$. However, if we
restrict all edges to have equal latency $\ell$ and capacity $c$ while having
possibly different weights (weights could deviate arbitrarily from $\ell$), we
give an algorithm that constructs an MST in $\tilde{O}(D + \sqrt{n\ell/c})$

stratospheric flight of the OLIMPO payload, at an altitude of 37.8 km. We find
that the detectors can be tuned in-flight, and their performance is robust
against radiative background changes due to varying telescope elevation. We
also find that the noise equivalent power of the detectors in flight is
significantly reduced with respect to the one measured in the laboratory, and
close to photon-noise limited performance. The effect of primary cosmic rays
crossing the detector is found to be consistent with the expected ionization
energy loss with phonon-mediated energy transfer from the ionization sites to
the resonators. In the OLIMPO detector arrays, at float, cosmic ray events
affect less than 4% of the detector samplings for all the pixels of all the
arrays, and less than 1% of the samplings for most of the pixels. These results
are also representative of what one can expect from primary cosmic rays in a
satellite mission with similar KIDs and instrument environment.

However, it is very challenging to track the position of the surgical

surgical tools is paramount. Deep learning-based semantic segmentation in
frames of surgery videos has the potential to facilitate this task. In this
work, we modify the U-Net architecture named U-NetPlus, by introducing a
pre-trained encoder and re-design the decoder part, by replacing the transposed
convolution operation with an upsampling operation based on nearest-neighbor
(NN) interpolation. To further improve performance, we also employ a very fast
and flexible data augmentation technique. We trained the framework on 8 x 225
frame sequences of robotic surgical videos, available through the MICCAI 2017
EndoVis Challenge dataset and tested it on 8 x 75 frame and 2 x 300 frame
videos. Using our U-NetPlus architecture, we report a 90.20% DICE for binary
segmentation, 76.26% DICE for instrument part segmentation, and 46.07% for
instrument type (i.e., all instruments) segmentation, outperforming the results
of previous techniques implemented and tested on these data.

Model Selection (RFMS) is proposed under the scenario, for example, when data
from healthcare units can not leave the site it is situated on and it is
forbidden to carry out training algorithms on remote data sites due to either
technical or privacy and trust concerns. To carry out a clinical research under
this scenario, an analyst could train a machine learning model only on local
data site, but it is still possible to execute a statistical query at a certain
cost in the form of sending a machine learning model to some of the remote data
sites and get the performance measures as feedback, maybe due to prediction
being usually much cheaper. Compared to federated learning, which is optimizing
the model parameters directly by carrying out training across all data sites,
RFMS trains model parameters only on one local data site but optimizes
hyper-parameters across other data sites jointly since hyper-parameters play an
important role in machine learning performance. The aim is to get a Pareto
optimal model with respective to both local and remote unseen prediction
losses, which could generalize well across data sites. In this work, we
specifically consider high dimensional data with shifted distributions over
data sites. As an initial investigation, Bayesian Optimization especially
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization is used to guide an adaptive
hyper-parameter optimization process to select models under the RFMS scenario.
Empirical results show that solely using the local data site to tune
hyper-parameters generalizes poorly across data sites, compared to methods that
utilize the local and remote performances. Furthermore, in terms of dominated
hypervolumes, multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithms show increased
performance across multiple data sites among other candidates.

  Gaussian Noise",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-orthogonal communications play an important role in future communication
architectures. In such scenarios, the received signal is corrupted by an
interfering signal which is typically cyclostationary in continuous-time. If
the period of interference is synchronized with the sampling period, the
sampled interference is a discrete-time (DT) cyclostationary process. However,
in the common interference scenario, the period of the interference is not
necessarily synchronized with the sampling period. In such cases, the DT
interference is an almost cyclostationary process. In this work we characterize
the capacity of channels in which the noise arises from a sampled
cyclostationary Gaussian process. For the case of synchronous sampling,
capacity can be obtained in closed form. When sampling is not synchronized with
the symbol rate of the interference, the resulting channel is not information
stable, thus classic tools are not applicable. Using information spectrum
methods, we prove that capacity can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of
capacities of channels with cyclostationary noise. Our results characterize the
effects of changes in the sampling rate and sampling time offset on the
capacity of the resulting DT channel. In particular, we demonstrate that minor
variations in the sampling period can substantially affect capacity.

of binary tree-child networks is one of the most studied ones. However, very
little is known about the combinatorial structure of these networks. In this

reduction/augmentation operations that extend and generalize analogous

finite temperatures. The baryon equation of state, which includes nucleons and
$\Delta$ resonances is supplemented by the contribution of the pion gas
described either by the vacuum dispersion relation or with taking into account
the $s$-wave pion-baryon interaction. Distribution of the charge between
components is found. Thermodynamical characteristics on $T-n$ plane are
considered. The energy-density and entropy-density isotherms are constructed
and a dynamical trajectory of the hadron system formed in heavy-ion collisions
is described. The effects of taking into account the $\Delta$ isobars and the
$s$-wave pion-nucleon interaction on pion differential cross sections, pion to
proton and $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratios are studied. The liquid-gas first-order phase
transition is studied within the same models in isospin-symmetric and
asymmetric systems. We demonstrate that our models yield thermodynamic
characteristics of the phase transition compatible with available experimental
results. In addition, we discuss the scaled variance of baryon and electric
charge in the phase transition region. Effect of the non-zero surface tension
on spatial redistribution of the electric charge is considered for a possible
application to heavy-ion collisions at low energies.

Hamiltonians whose ground states are lattice versions of fractional quantum
Hall states. The exact lattice models involve interactions over long distances,
which is difficult to realize in experiments. It seems, however, that such
long-range interactions should not be necessary, as the correlations decay
exponentially in the bulk. This poses the question, whether the Hamiltonians
can be truncated to contain only local interactions without changing the
physics of the ground state. Previous studies have in a couple of cases with
particularly much symmetry obtained such local Hamiltonians by keeping only a
few local terms and numerically optimizing the coefficients. Here, we
investigate a different strategy to construct truncated Hamiltonians, which
does not rely on optimization, and which can be applied independent of the
choice of lattice. We test the approach on two models with bosonic
Laughlin-like ground states with filling factor $1/2$ and $1/4$, respectively.
We first investigate how the coupling strengths in the exact Hamiltonians
depend on distance, and then we study the truncated models. For the case of
$1/2$ filling, we find that the truncated model with truncation radius
$\sqrt{2}$ lattice constants on the square lattice and $1$ lattice constant on
the triangular lattice has an approximate twofold ground state degeneracy on
the torus, and the overlap per site between these states and the states
constructed from conformal field theory is higher than $0.99$ for the lattices
considered. For the model at $1/4$ filling, our results give some hints that a
truncation radius of $\sqrt{5}$ on the square lattice and $\sqrt{7}$ on the
triangular lattice might be enough, but the finite size effects are too large
to judge whether the topology is, indeed, present in the thermodynamic limit.

lengths is a fundamental property of isotropic superconductors at the critical
Bogomolnyi point (B-point). The self-dual state of the condensate is infinitely
degenerate, which is the core reason for the sharp transition between the
superconductivity types in the nearest vicinity of the critical temperature
T_c. Below T_c non-local interactions in the condensate remove the degeneracy,
which leads to the appearance of a finite intertype (IT) domain between types I
and II. This domain exhibits the mixed state with exotic field-condensate
configurations and non-standard magnetic response, which cannot be understood
within the dichotomy of the conventional superconductivity types. At a first
glance, this picture does not apply to an anisotropic system because no spatial
matching between the condensate and magnetic field can be generally expected
for direction-dependent characteristic lengths. However, contrary to these
expectations, here we demonstrate that anisotropic superconductors follow the
same scenario of the interchange between types I and II. In anisotropic
materials the IT domain is governed by the B-point of the effective isotropic
model obtained by the appropriate scaling transformation of the initial
anisotropic formalism. This transformation depends on the direction of the
applied magnetic field, and thus the superconductivity type of strongly
anisotropic materials can be dependent on this direction.

monotone inclusions and complicated convex optimization problems. In the new
version, cocoercive operators can be processed with a single forward step per
iteration. In the convex optimization context, cocoercivity is equivalent to
Lipschitz differentiability. Prior forward-step versions of projective
splitting did not fully exploit cocoercivity and required two forward steps per
iteration for such operators. Our new single-forward-step method establishes a
symmetry between projective splitting algorithms, the classical
forward-backward splitting method (FB), and Tseng's forward-backward-forward
method (FBF). The new procedure allows for larger stepsizes for cocoercive
operators: the stepsize bound is $2\beta$ for a $\beta$-cocoercive operator,
the same bound as has been established for FB. We show that FB corresponds to
an unattainable boundary case of the parameters in the new procedure. Unlike
FB, the new method allows for a backtracking procedure when the cocoercivity
constant is unknown. Proving convergence of the algorithm requires some
departures from the prior proof framework for projective splitting. We close
with some computational tests establishing competitive performance for the
method.

Rather, the size and rate of growth in attacks have actually outpaced carriers'

today's IP networks. We demonstrate by a new DDoS mitigation solution over NDN,
Fine-grained Interest Traffic Throttling FITT, that NDN's architectural
changes, even when incrementally deployed, can make DDoS attacks fundamentally
more difficult to launch and less effective. FITT leverages the NDN design to
enable the network to detect DDoS from victim's feedback, throttles DDoS
traffic by reverse its exact paths through the network, and enforces control
over the misbehaving entities at their sources. Our extensive simulation
results show that FITT can throttle attack traffic with one-way time delay from
the victim to the NDN gateway; upon activation, FITT effectively stop attack
traffic from impacting benign flows, resulting in over 99\% of packets reaching
victims being legitimate ones. We further demonstrate that service providers
may implement NDN/FITT on existing CDN nodes as an incrementally deployable

  11. Figures: 9",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their
learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes
that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their
representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task.
However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was
only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast,
networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of
task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more
robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity
of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from
all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation
techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different
activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show
that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and
the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We
also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between
different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization
leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting.
Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively
correlated with generalization.

While simple resource-competition models don't allow for coexistence of a large
number of species, it was recently shown that metabolic trade-offs can allow
unlimited diversity. Does this diversity persist with more realistic,
intermittent nutrient supply? Here, we demonstrate theoretically that in serial
dilution culture, metabolic trade-offs allow for high diversity. When a small
amount of nutrient is supplied to each batch, the serial dilution dynamics
mimic a chemostat-like steady state. If more nutrient is supplied, diversity
depends on the amount of nutrient supplied due to an ""early-bird"" effect. The
interplay of this effect with different environmental factors and
diversity-supporting mechanisms leads to a variety of relationships between
nutrient supply and diversity, suggesting that real ecosystems may not obey a
universal nutrient-diversity relationship.

the size of many-body operators. These limitations are typically related to
both the (iterative) storing of the associated tensors and to the computational
time related to their multiple contractions in the calculation of various
quantities of interest. However, not all the degrees of freedom encapsulated
into these tensors equally contribute to the description of many-body
observables. Identifying systematic and dominating patterns, a relevant
objective is to achieve an \emph{a priori} reduction to the most relevant
degrees of freedom via a pre-processing of the A-body problem. The present
paper is dedicated to the analysis of two different paradigms to do so. The
factorization of tensors in terms of lower-rank ones, whose know-how has been
recently transferred to the realm of nuclear structure, is compared to a
reduction of the tensors' index size based on an importance truncation. While
the objective is to eventually utilize these pre-processing tools in the
context of non-perturbative many-body methods, benchmark calculations are
presently performed within the frame of perturbation theory. More specifically,
we employ the recently introduced Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory that
is systematically applicable to open-shell nuclei displaying strong
correlations. This extended perturbation theory serves as a jumpstart for
non-perturbative Bogoliubov coupled cluster and Gorkov self-consistent Green's
function theories. Results obtained in ""small"" model spaces are equally
encouraging for tensor factorization and importance truncation techniques.
While the former requires significant numerical developments to be applied in
large model spaces, the latter is presently applied in this context and
demonstrates great potential to enable high-accuracy calculations at a much
reduced computational cost.

fundamental results determining solutions to the coboundary equation:
\begin{eqnarray*} f = g - g \circ T \end{eqnarray*} where $f \in L^p$ and $T$
is ergodic invertible measure preserving on $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu )$. We extend
previous results by showing for any measurable $f$ that is non-zero on a set of
positive measure, the class of measure preserving $T$ with a measurable
solution $g$ is meager (including the case where $\int_X f d\mu = 0$).
  From this fact, a natural question arises: given $f$, does there always exist
a solution pair $T$ and $g$? In regards to this question, our main results are:
  (i) Given measurable $f$, there exists an ergodic invertible measure
preserving transformation $T$ and measurable function $g$ such that $f(x) =
g(x) - g(Tx)$ for a.e. $x\in X$, if and only if $\int_{f > 0} f d\mu = -
\int_{f < 0} f d\mu$ (whether finite or $\infty$).
  (ii) Given mean-zero $f \in L^p$ for $p \geq 1$, there exists an ergodic
invertible measure preserving $T$ and $g \in L^{p-1}$ such that $f(x) = g(x) -
g( Tx )$ for a.e. $x \in X$.
  (iii) In some sense, the previous existence result is the best possible. For
$p \geq 1$, there exist mean-zero $f \in L^p$ such that for any ergodic
invertible measure preserving $T$ and any measurable $g$ such that $f(x) = g(x)
- g(Tx)$ a.e., then $g \notin L^q$ for $q > p - 1$. Also, we show this
situation is generic for mean-zero $f \in L^p$.
  Finally, it is shown that we cannot expect finite moments for solutions $g$,
when $f \in L^1$. In particular, given any $\phi : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
such that $\lim_{x\to \infty} \phi (x) = \infty$, there exist mean-zero $f \in
L^1$ such that for any solutions $T$ and $g$, the transfer function $g$
satisfies: \begin{eqnarray*} \int_{X} \phi \big( | g(x) | \big) d\mu = \infty.

consistency must be extended to this framework. Then a suitable convergence
theorem is established, generalizing the classical convergence theorem of Lax

there exists no one-body local order parameter in contrast to conventional
orderings. It is shown that the Mottness, or integer filling nature for each
orbital due to strong correlation effects, is a relevant feature of the present
orbital order. The local orbital moment thus vanishes and the static distortion
associated with a conventional orbital moment is absent. Transport
characteristics are also investigated, and it is found that the dimensionality
is effectively reduced from three to two at low energies, while the cubic

service to the network edge. To this end, edge infrastructure providers (EIPs)
need to bring computation and storage resources to the network edge and allow
edge service providers (ESPs) to provision latency-critical services to users.
Currently, EIPs prefer to establish a series of private edge-computing
environments to serve specific requirements of users. This kind of resource
provisioning mechanism severely limits the development and spread of edge
computing for serving diverse user requirements. To this end, we propose an
integrated resource provisioning model, named edge federation, to seamlessly
realize the resource cooperation and service provisioning across standalone
edge computing providers and clouds. To efficiently schedule and utilize the
resources across multiple EIPs, we systematically characterize the provisioning
process as a large-scale linear programming (LP) problem and transform it into
an easily solved form. Accordingly, we design a dynamic algorithm to tackle the
varying service demands from users. We conduct extensive experiments over the
base station networks in Toronto city. Compared with the existing fixed
contract model and multihoming model, edge federation can reduce the overall
cost of EIPs by 23.3% to 24.5%, and 15.5% to 16.3%, respectively.

spatially flat. We aim to non-perturbatively check the conditions under which a
flat or nearly flat expanding dust universe, including the LCDM model if
interpreted as strictly flat, forbids the gravitational collapse of structure.
We quantify spatial curvature at turnaround. We use the Hamiltonian constraint
to determine the pointwise conditions required for an overdensity to reach its
turnaround epoch in an exactly flat spatial domain. We illustrate this with a
plane-symmetric, exact, cosmological solution of the Einstein equation,
extending earlier work. More generally, for a standard initial power spectrum,
we use the relativistic Zel'dovich approximation implemented in 'inhomog' to
numerically estimate how much positive spatial curvature is required for
turnaround to be allowed at typical epochs/length scales in almost-EdS and
almost-LCDM models with inhomogeneous curvature. We find that gravitational
collapse in a spatially exactly flat, irrotational, expanding, dust universe is
relativistically forbidden pointwise. In the spatially flat plane-symmetric
model considered here, pancake collapse is excluded both pointwise and in
averaged domains. In an almost-EdS or LCDM model, the per-domain average
curvature in collapsing domains almost always becomes strongly positive prior
to turnaround, with the expansion-normalised curvature functional reaching
$\Omega_{\cal R}^{\cal D} \sim -5$. We show analytically that a special case
gives $\Omega_{\cal R}^{\cal D} = -5$ exactly (if normalised using the EdS
expansion rate) at turnaround. An interpretation of LCDM as literally 3-Ricci
flat would forbid structure formation. The difference between relativistic
cosmology and a strictly flat LCDM model is fundamental in principle, but we
find that the geometrical effect is weak.

  recognition","5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tabels",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The conventional speaker recognition frameworks (e.g., the i-vector and
CNN-based approach) have been successfully applied to various tasks when the
channel of the enrolment dataset is similar to that of the test dataset.
However, in real-world applications, mismatch always exists between these two
datasets, which may severely deteriorate the recognition performance.
Previously, a few channel compensation algorithms have been proposed, such as
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Probabilistic LDA. However, these
methods always require the collections of different channels from a specific
speaker, which is unrealistic to be satisfied in real scenarios. Inspired by
domain adaptation, we propose a novel deep-learning based speaker recognition
framework to learn the channel-invariant and speaker-discriminative speech
representations via channel adversarial training. Specifically, we first employ
a gradient reversal layer to remove variations across different channels. Then,
the compressed information is projected into the same subspace by adversarial
training. Experiments on test datasets with 54,133 speakers demonstrate that
the proposed method is not only effective at alleviating the channel mismatch
problem, but also outperforms state-of-the-art speaker recognition methods.
Compared with the i-vector-based method and the CNN-based method, our proposed
method achieves significant relative improvement of 44.7% and 22.6%
respectively in terms of the Top1 recall.

Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. The CFD-driven training is an
extension of the gene expression programming method (Weatheritt and Sandberg,
2016), but crucially the fitness of candidate models is now evaluated by
running RANS calculations in an integrated way, rather than using an algebraic
function. Unlike other data-driven methods that fit the Reynolds stresses of
trained models to high-fidelity data, the cost function for the CFD-driven
training can be defined based on any flow feature from the CFD results. This
extends the applicability of the method especially when the training data is
limited. Furthermore, the resulting model, which is the one providing the most
accurate CFD results at the end of the training, inherently shows good
performance in RANS calculations. To demonstrate the potential of this new
method, the CFD-driven machine learning approach is applied to model
development for wake mixing in turbomachines. A new model is trained based on a
high-pressure turbine case and then tested for three additional cases, all
representative of modern turbine nozzles. Despite the geometric configurations
and operating conditions being different among the cases, the predicted wake
mixing profiles are significantly improved in all of these a posteriori tests.
Moreover, the model equation is explicitly given and available for analysis,
thus it could be deduced that the enhanced wake prediction is predominantly due
to the extra diffusion introduced by the CFD-driven model.

stress-strain and strength characteristics of sand grains are influenced with
grain size, their distribution and packing. Also the macroscopic behaviour of

Particle size is one of the important properties which plays a dominant role on
the stress, strain and strength responses of granular materials. Alteration of
grain size results in the change of void ratio as well as particle effective
contact area revolutionized and the load distribution mechanism of particle to
particle contact. To evaluate the effect of particle size, a series of direct
shear tests were performed considering uniform particles of eight samples
(0.075, 0.15, 0.212, 0.300, 0.600, 1.18, 1.72 and 2.76 mm) and graded particles
of two samples (0.075-1.18 mm and 0.075-2.36 mm). Three types of normal loads
(0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 kN) were selected for each test. For uniform particles,
particles retained on individual sieve size were considered and in graded
particles combination of each uniform particle pondered. A theoretical approach
was also proposed to correlate the particle size and macroscopic response. From
the experimental results, it was observed that for each set of normal load with
the increase of particle size ,angle of internal friction as well as maximum
horizontal shear stress increases for uniform sands and a similar response was
noticed in graded sands but the larger the gradation the higher the shear
strength. Maximum horizontal shear and angle of internal friction with respect
to particle size is also influenced by normal stress. Experimental results have
good agreement with the theoretical approach.

  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in the development of Autonomous
Vehicles (AV). However, there are two types of attack challenges that can
affect AVs and are yet to be resolved, i.e., sensor attacks and vehicle access
attacks. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work that
proposes a novel authentication scheme involving DRAM power-up unique features
using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which can be used to implement
secure access control of autonomous vehicles. Our approach consists of two
parts. First, we convert raw power-up sequence data from DRAM cells into a
two-dimensional (2D) format to generate a DRAM image structure. Second, we
apply deep CNN to DRAM images, in order to extract unique features from each
memory to classify them for authentication. To evaluate our proposed approach,
we utilize data from three Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) DRAMs taken under
various environmental and other conditions (high/low temperature, high/low
supply voltage and aging effects). Based on our results, our proposed
authentication method ``DRAMNet'' achieves 98.63% accuracy and 98.49%
precision. In comparison to other state-of-the-art CNN architectures, such as
the AlexNet and VGGNet models, our DRAMNet approach fares equally well or
better than them.

task if they are well fused. However, the prevalent semantic edge detection
methods apply a fixed weight fusion strategy where images with different

weights for all images and locations regardless of their different semantics or
local context. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic feature fusion strategy
that assigns different fusion weights for different input images and locations
adaptively. This is achieved by a proposed weight learner to infer proper
fusion weights over multi-level features for each location of the feature map,
conditioned on the specific input. In this way, the heterogeneity in
contributions made by different locations of feature maps and input images can
be better considered and thus help produce more accurate and sharper edge
predictions. We show that our model with the novel dynamic feature fusion is
superior to fixed weight fusion and also the na\""ive location-invariant weight

In particular, our method outperforms all existing well established methods and

years since its discovery. In this paper, we present a detailed Bayesian
analysis of the precessional evolution of the width of the total intensity
profile, to understand the changes to the line-of-sight impact angle ($\beta$)
of the pulsar using four different physically motivated prior distribution
models. Although we cannot statistically differentiate between the models with
confidence, the temporal evolution of the linear and circular polarisations
strongly argue that our line-of-sight crossed the magnetic pole around MJD
54000 and that only two models remain viable. For both these models, it appears
likely that the pulsar will precess out of our line-of-sight in the next $3-5$
years, assuming a simple beam geometry. Marginalising over $\beta$ suggests
that the pulsar is a near-orthogonal rotator and provides the first
polarization-independent estimate of the scale factor ($\mathbb{A}$) that
relates the pulsar beam opening angle ($\rho$) to its rotational period ($P$)
as $\rho = \mathbb{A}P^{-0.5}$ : we find it to be $> 6 \rm~deg~s^{0.5}$ at 1.4

magnetic field with comparable brightness, we might expect to see evidence of
an interpulse arising in PSR J1141$-$6545, unless the emission is patchy.

account all the possible interferences among operators by studying the
intersections among the ellipsoidal surfaces of constant signal of DAMA and
other experiments in the space of the coupling constants of the effective
theory. In our analysis we assume a standard Maxwellian velocity distribution
in the Galaxy. We find that, compared to the elastic case, inelastic scattering
partially relieves but does not eliminate the existing tension between the DAMA
effect and the constraints from the null results of other experiments. Such
tension is very large in all the parameter space with the exception of a small
region for WIMP mass $m_{\chi}\simeq$ 10 GeV and mass splitting $\delta\gtrsim$
20 keV, where it is partially, but not completely relieved. In such region the
bounds from fluorine targets are evaded in a kinematic way because the minimal
WIMP incoming speed required to trigger upscatters off fluorine exceeds the
maximal WIMP velocity in the Galaxy, or is very close to it. As a consequence,
we also find that the residual tension between DAMA and other results is more
sensitive on the astrophysical parameters compared to the elastic case. We find
that the configurations with the smallest tension can produce enough yearly
modulation in some of the DAMA bins in compliance with the constraints from
other experiments, but the ensuing shape of the modulation spectrum is too
steep compared to the measured one. For such configurations the recent
COSINE-100 bound is evaded in a natural way due to their large expected

range of important problems, from molecular simulation to search algorithms,
once they can be scaled up to large numbers of quantum bits (qubits), typically
millions. For most solid-state qubit technologies, e.g. those using
superconducting circuits or semiconductor spins, scaling poses a significant
challenge as every additional qubit increases the heat generated, while the
cooling power of dilution refrigerators is severely limited at their operating
temperature below 100 mK. Here we demonstrate operation of a scalable silicon
quantum processor unit cell, comprising two qubits confined to quantum dots
(QDs) at $\sim$1.5 Kelvin. We achieve this by isolating the QDs from the
electron reservoir, initialising and reading the qubits solely via tunnelling
of electrons between the two QDs. We coherently control the qubits using
electrically-driven spin resonance (EDSR) in isotopically enriched silicon
$^{28}$Si, attaining single-qubit gate fidelities of 98.6% and coherence time
$T_2^*$ = 2$\mu$s during `hot' operation, comparable to those of spin qubits in
natural silicon at millikelvin temperatures. Furthermore, we show that the unit
cell can be operated at magnetic fields as low as 0.1 T, corresponding to a
qubit control frequency of 3.5 GHz, where the qubit energy is well below the
thermal energy. The unit cell constitutes the core building block of a
full-scale silicon quantum computer, and satisfies layout constraints required

computer could be operated at elevated temperatures in a simple pumped $^4$He

fluctuations at the optimal pressure (~3 GPa) exhibited unexpected suppression
compared with the AFM fluctuations at ambient pressure, even though the optimal
pressure is close to the phase boundary of the AFM phase induced at the
high-pressure region. In addition, we revealed that the SC phase at an applied

unmixing, some spatial-contextual information in the hyperspectral images has
been exploited to improve the performance of the unmixing recently. The total
variation (TV) has been widely used to promote the spatial homogeneity as well
as the smoothness between adjacent pixels. However, the computation task for
hyperspectral sparse unmixing with a TV regularization term is heavy. Besides,
the convergence of the primal alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) for the hyperspectral sparse unmixing with a TV regularization term has
not been explained in details. In this paper, we design an efficient and
convergent dual symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM (sGS-ADMM) for hyperspectral sparse
unmixing with a TV regularization term. We also present the global convergence

in numerical experiments, our algorithm can obviously improve the efficiency of
the unmixing compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm. More importantly, we
can obtain images with higher quality.

sign problem that makes convergence exponentially slow. One promising remedy is
to use Picard-Lefschetz theory to flow the domain of the field variables into
the complex plane, where the integral is better behaved. By Cauchy's theorem,
the final value of the path integral is unchanged. Previous analyses have
considered the case of real scalar fields in thermal equilibrium, employing a
closed Schwinger-Keldysh time contour, allowing the evaluation of the full
quantum correlation functions. Here we extend the analysis by not requiring a
closed time path, instead allowing for an initial density matrix for
out-of-equilibrium initial value problems. We are able to explicitly implement
Gaussian initial conditions, and by separating the initial time and the later
times into a two-step Monte-Carlo sampling, we are able to avoid the phenomenon
of multiple thimbles. In fact, there exists one and only one thimble for each
sample member of the initial density matrix. We demonstrate the approach
through explicitly computing the real-time propagator for an interacting scalar
in 0+1 dimensions, and find very good convergence allowing for comparison with
perturbation theory and the classical-statistical approximation to real-time

implies satisfaction of the latter. Compound STCs go a step further by allowing
multiple trigger and constraint conditions to be combined via Boolean ""and"" or

using continuous variables, and thus enable the incorporation of discrete

compound STCs are used to solve quad-rotor path planning problems that would
typically require the use of computationally expensive mixed-integer

four valence nucleons (the quartet) move on the top of the core (daughter)
nucleus. In the QM approach, it is assumed that the intrinsic wave function of
the quartet is changed from the pure cluster configuration to the shell-model
configuration when it crosses some critical radius and enters into the core
nucleus. The QM approach could give not only the level scheme, the
electromagnetic transition, the nuclear radius, but also the alpha-cluster
formation probability. Numerical results are calculated for ${}^{20}$Ne,
${}^{44}$Ti, and ${}^{212}$Po, where a quartet moves on top of a double magic
nucleus. Good agreement with experimental data and previous theoretical studies
is obtained. The QM approach is a useful complement to the present
phenomenological and microscopic models and could help deepen our understanding
of alpha clustering across the nuclide chart.

assembly with initial position uncertainty. Two in-hand cameras and a
force-torque sensor are used to account for the position uncertainty. A program
sequence comprising learning-based visual servoing, spiral search, and
impedance control is implemented to perform the peg-in-hole task with feedback
from the above sensors. Contributions are mainly made in the learning-based
visual servoing of the sequence, where a deep neural network is trained with
various sets of synthetic data generated using the concept of domain
randomization to predict where a hole is. In the experiments and analysis
section, the network is analyzed and compared, and a real-world robotic system
to insert pegs to holes using the proposed method is implemented. The results
show that the implemented peg-in-hole assembly system can perform successful
peg-in-hole insertions on surfaces with various colors and textures. It can
generally speed up the entire peg-in-hole process.

Recently, there has been growing interest in the application of crowdsourcing
for this purpose; a technique that has proven effective for creating
large-scale datasets across a range of disciplines, from computer vision to
astrophysics. Despite the growing popularity of this approach, there has not
yet been a comprehensive literature review to provide guidance to researchers
considering using crowdsourcing methodologies in their own medical imaging

for 12 other clusters. Those observations show clumpy, massive and long, 3--25
kpc, molecular filaments, preferentially located around the radio bubbles
inflated by the AGN (Active Galactic Nucleus). Two objects show nuclear
molecular disks. The optical nebula is certainly tracing the warm envelopes of
cold molecular filaments. Surprisingly, the radial profile of the H$\alpha$/CO
flux ratio is roughly constant for most of the objects, suggesting that (i)
between 1.2 to 7 times more cold gas could be present and (ii) local processes
must be responsible for the excitation. Projected velocities are between
100--400 km s$^{-1}$, with disturbed kinematics and sometimes coherent
gradients. This is likely due to the mixing in projection of several thin
unresolved filaments. The velocity fields may be stirred by turbulence induced
by bubbles, jets or merger-induced sloshing. Velocity and dispersions are low,
below the escape velocity. Cold clouds should eventually fall back and fuel the
AGN. We compare the filament's radial extent, r$_{fil}$, with the region where
the X-ray gas can become thermally unstable. The filaments are always inside
the low-entropy and short cooling time region, where t$_{cool}$/t$_{ff}$<20 (9
of 13 sources). The range t$_{cool}$/t$_{ff}$, 8-23 at r$_{fil}$, is likely due
to (i) a more complex gravitational potential affecting the free-fall time
(e.g., sloshing, mergers); (ii) the presence of inhomogeneities or uplifted gas
in the ICM, affecting the cooling time. For some of the sources, r$_{fil}$ lies
where the ratio of the cooling time to the eddy-turnover time,
t$_{cool}$/t$_{eddy}$, is approximately unity.

Despite its importance, there
is no unified methodological framework to measure diversity and its three
components of variety, balance and disparity. Current approaches take into
account disparity of the types by considering their pairwise similarities.
Pairwise similarities between types do not adequately capture total disparity,
since they fail to take into account in which way pairs are similar. Hence,
pairwise similarities do not discriminate between similarity of types in terms
of the same feature and similarity of types in terms of different features.
This paper presents an alternative approach which is based similarities of
features between types over the whole set. The proposed measure of diversity
properly takes into account the aspects of variety, balance and disparity, and
without having to set an arbitrary weight for each aspect of diversity. Based
on this measure, the 'ABC decomposition' is introduced, which provides separate
measures for the variety, balance and disparity, allowing them to enter
analysis separately. The method is illustrated by analyzing the industrial
diversity from 1850 to present while taking into account the overlap in
occupations they employ. Finally, the framework is extended to take into
account disparity considering multiple features, providing a helpful tool in
analysis of high-dimensional data.

distributions, to measure the number counts and LFs at far-infrared (FIR) and
sub-millimetre (sub-mm) wavelengths.
  Thanks to our de-confusion technique and deep multi-wavelength photometry, we
are able to achieve more accurate measurements while probing ten times below
the confusion limit. Our number counts at 250 microns agree well with previous
Herschel studies. However, our counts at 350 and 500 microns are considerably
below previous Herschel results. This is due to previous studies suffering from
source confusion which worsens towards longer wavelength. Our number counts at
450 and 870 microns show excellent agreement with previous determinations
derived from single dish and interferometric observations. Our measurements of
the monochromatic LF and the total IR LF agree well with previous results. The
increased dynamic range of our measurements allows us to better measure the
faint-end slope of the LF and measure the dust-obscured SFRD out to z~6. We
find that the fraction of dust obscured star-formation activity is at its
highest around z~1 which then decreases towards both low and high redshift. We
do not find a shift of balance between z~3 and z~4 in the cosmic star-formation
history from being dominated by unobscured star formation at higher redshift to
obscured star formation at lower redshift. However, we do find 3<z<4 to be an
interesting transition period as the fraction of the total SFRD that is
obscured by dust is significantly lower at higher redshifts.

which engineered-photonic state provides for better QKD performance when

We then compute the back-propagation signals by designing and using the impulse
response of the backward sound propagation based on the acoustic ray paths. For
identifying the 3D source position, we suggest a localization method based on
the Monte Carlo localization algorithm. Candidates for a source position is
determined by identifying the convergence regions of acoustic ray paths. This
candidate is validated by measuring similarities between back-propagation
signals, under the assumption that the back-propagation signals of different
acoustic ray paths should be similar near the sound source position. Thanks to
considering similarities of back-propagation signals, our approach can localize
a source position with an averaged error of 0.51 m in a room of 7 m by 7 m area
with 3 m height in tested environments. We also observe 65 % to 220 %

system is its ability to automatically grade short student answers. A typical
automatic short answer grading system (ASAG) grades student answers across
multiple domains (or subjects). Grading student answers requires building a
supervised machine learning model that evaluates the similarity of the student
answer with the reference answer(s). We observe that unlike typical textual
similarity or entailment tasks, the notion of similarity is not universal here.
On one hand, para-phrasal constructs of the language can indicate similarity
independent of the domain. On the other hand, two words, or phrases, that are
not strict synonyms of each other, might mean the same in certain domains.
Building on this observation, we propose JMD-ASAG, the first joint multidomain
deep learning architecture for automatic short answer grading that performs
domain adaptation by learning generic and domain-specific aspects from the
limited domain-wise training data. JMD-ASAG not only learns the domain-specific
characteristics but also overcomes the dependence on a large corpus by learning
the generic characteristics from the task-specific data itself. On a
large-scale industry dataset and a benchmarking dataset, we show that our model
performs significantly better than existing techniques which either learn
domain-specific models or adapt a generic similarity scoring model from a large
corpus. Further, on the benchmarking dataset, we report state-of-the-art

The challenging task of corner case detection in video, which is also somehow

control and selectivity of the spatial distribution of spin waves. Calculations

requires a reconsideration of modelling strategies for the translational and
rotational dynamics of natural bodies, to ensure that model errors are well
below the measurement uncertainties.
  The influence of the gravitational interaction of the full mass distributions
of celestial bodies, the so-called figure-figure effects, will need to be
included for selected future missions. The mathematical formulation of this
problem to arbitrary degree is often provided in an elegant and compact manner
that is not trivially relatable to the formulation used in space geodesy and
ephemeris generation. This complicates the robust implementation of such a
model in operational software packages. We formulate the problem in a manner
that is directly compatible with the implementation used in typical dynamical
modelling codes: in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients and Legendre
polynomials. An analytical formulation for the associated variational equations
for both translational and rotational motion is derived.
  We apply our methodology to both Phobos and the KW4 binary asteroid system,

next-generation tracking data. For the case of Phobos, omitting these effects
during estimation results in relative errors of $0.42\%$ and $0.065\%$ for the

pieces of information propagate over a network. In reality, however, messages
are not immutable, but may be morphed with every step, potentially entailing
large cumulative distortions. This process may lead to misinformation even in
the absence of malevolent actors, and understanding it is crucial for modeling
and improving online information systems. Here, we perform a controlled,
crowdsourced experiment in which we simulate the propagation of information
from medical research papers. Starting from the original abstracts, crowd
workers iteratively shorten previously produced summaries to increasingly
smaller lengths. We also collect control summaries where the original abstract
is compressed directly to the final target length. Comparing cascades to
controls allows us to separate the effect of the length constraint from that of
accumulated distortion. Via careful manual coding, we annotate lexical and
semantic units in the medical abstracts and track them along cascades. We find
that iterative summarization has a negative impact due to the accumulation of
error, but that high-quality intermediate summaries result in less distorted
messages than in the control case. Different types of information behave
differently; in particular, the conclusion of a medical abstract (i.e., its key
message) is distorted most. Finally, we compare abstractive with extractive
summaries, finding that the latter are less prone to semantic distortion.
Overall, this work is a first step in studying information cascades without the
assumption that disseminated content is immutable, with implications on our
understanding of the role of word-of-mouth effects on the misreporting of
science.

obtaining the conductivity of the medium. The analysis has been done in the
regime where inhomogeneity of the field is small so that the collision effect
could be significant. The modeling of the QCD medium is based on a
quasiparticle description where the medium effects have been encoded in the
effective quarks, antiquarks and gluons. The temperature dependence of the
linear longitudinal current density (in terms of the electric field) and the
additional components of current density due to the inhomogeneity of electric
field (in terms of its derivatives) have been obtained by solving the
$(1+1)-$dimensional effective covariant kinetic theory with a proper collision
term. The conductivity has been obtained from the current density in the
presence of the inhomogeneous field. The collisional aspects of the medium have
been captured by including both thermal relaxation approximation and the
Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collision kernels in the analysis. Further, the hot QCD
medium effects and higher Landau level contributions to the current density and
the conductivity have been investigated. It has been seen that the effects of
inhomogeneity of the field and the mean field corrections to the current
density and the conductivity are more visible in the temperature regions which
are not far from the transition temperature.

distribution over observations that exceed a fixed threshold. However, the
choice of such threshold is critical and can affect the inferential results.
Extreme value mixture models have been defined to estimate the threshold using
the full dataset and to give accurate tail estimates. Such models assume that
the tail behavior is constant for all observations. However, the extreme
behavior of financial returns often changes considerably in time and such
changes occur by sudden shocks of the market. Here we extend the extreme value
mixture model class to formally take into account distributional extreme
changepoints, by allowing for the presence of regime-dependent parameters
modelling the tail of the distribution. This extension formally uses the full
dataset to both estimate the thresholds and the extreme changepoint locations,
giving uncertainty measures for both quantities. Estimation of functions of
interest in extreme value analyses is performed via MCMC algorithms. Our
approach is evaluated through a series of simulations, applied to real data
sets and assessed against competing approaches. Evidence demonstrates that the
inclusion of different extreme regimes outperforms both static and dynamic
competing approaches in financial applications.

case as the frequency of EWs $\omega \simeq \omega_q$, where $\omega_q$ is the
qubit frequency. In this limit we derive the effective dynamic nonlinear wave
equation allowing one to obtain the frequency dependent transmission
coefficient of EWs, $D(\omega)$. In the linear regime and a relatively wide

cases of a single qubit and chains composed of a large number of densely
arranged qubits. However, in narrow frequency regions a chain of qubits allows
the resonant transmission of EWs with greatly enhanced $D(\omega)$. In the
nonlinear regime realized for a moderate power of applied microwave radiation,
we predict and analyze various transitions between states characterized by high

nonequilibrium steady states of an array of qubits achieved in this regime.

evidenced by recent incidents of single packages that broke or attacked
software running on millions of computers. This paper studies security risks
for users of npm by systematically analyzing dependencies between packages, the
maintainers responsible for these packages, and publicly reported security
issues. Studying the potential for running vulnerable or malicious code due to
third-party dependencies, we find that individual packages could impact large
parts of the entire ecosystem. Moreover, a very small number of maintainer
accounts could be used to inject malicious code into the majority of all
packages, a problem that has been increasing over time. Studying the potential
for accidentally using vulnerable code, we find that lack of maintenance causes
many packages to depend on vulnerable code, even years after a vulnerability
has become public. Our results provide evidence that npm suffers from single
points of failure and that unmaintained packages threaten large code bases. We
discuss several mitigation techniques, such as trusted maintainers and total
first-party security, and analyze their potential effectiveness.

existing for a long time is whether the movement of vortices can be predicted
or understood based on their historical data. Here we use both the experiments
and numerical simulations to demonstrate some generic features of vortex motion
and distribution. It can be found that the vortex movement can be described on
the framework of Brownian particles where they move ballistically for the time
shorter than some critical timescales, and then move diffusively.
Traditionally, the inertia of vortex has often been neglected when one accounts
for their motion, our results imply that vortices actually have
inertial-induced memory such that their short term movement can be predicted.
Extending to astro- and geo-physics, the critical timescales of transition are
in the order of minutes for vortices in atmosphere and ocean, in which this
inertial effect may often be neglected compared to other steering sources.
However, the timescales for vortices are considerably larger which range from
days to a year. It infers the new concept that not only the external sources
alone, for example the solar wind, but also the internal source, which is the
vortex inertia, can contribute to the short term Earth's magnetic field
variation.

than most gas-rich galaxies. ALMA images reveal a distribution of morphologies
from filamentary to disk-dominated structures. Circumnuclear disks on
kiloparsec scales appear rare. In most systems, half to nearly all of the
molecular gas lies in filamentary structures with masses of a few
$\times10^{8-10}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ that extend radially several to several
tens of kpc. In nearly all cases the molecular gas velocities lie far below
stellar velocity dispersions, indicating youth, transience or both. Filament
bulk velocities lie far below the galaxy's escape and free-fall speeds
indicating they are bound and being decelerated. Most extended molecular
filaments surround or lie beneath radio bubbles inflated by the central AGN.
Smooth velocity gradients found along the filaments are consistent with gas
flowing along streamlines surrounding these bubbles. Evidence suggests most of
the molecular clouds formed from low entropy X-ray gas that became thermally
unstable and cooled when lifted by the buoyant bubbles. Uplifted gas will stall
and fall back to the galaxy in a circulating flow. The distribution in
morphologies from filament to disk-dominated sources therefore implies slowly
evolving molecular structures driven by the episodic activity of the AGN.

shortest path queries in optimal time in the $\Theta(\log n)$-bit word RAM

in constant time, the adjacency query returns true if there is an edge between
two vertices in constant time, the neighborhood query reports the set of all
adjacent vertices in time proportional to the degree of the queried vertex, and
the shortest path query returns a shortest path in time proportional to its

succinctness, we first show that at least $n\log{n} - 2n\log\log n - O(n)$ bits
are necessary to represent any unlabeled interval graph $G$ with $n$ vertices,
answering an open problem of Yang and Pippenger [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 2017].

supporting not only the aforementioned queries optimally but also capable of
executing various combinatorial algorithms (like proper coloring, maximum

extend our ideas to other variants of interval graphs, for example, proper/unit

research focused on many-body localized (MBL) systems, characterized by new
kind of integrability, and by the area-law entanglement of eigenstates. We
investigate the effect of a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ symmetry on the dynamical
properties of a disordered Heisenberg chain. While $SU(2)$ symmetry is
inconsistent with the conventional MBL, a new non-ergodic regime is possible.
In this regime, the eigenstates exhibit faster than area-law, but still a
strongly sub-thermal scaling of entanglement entropy. Using exact
diagonalization, we establish that this non-ergodic regime is indeed realized
in the strongly disordered Heisenberg chains. We use real-space renormalization
group (RSRG) to construct approximate excited eigenstates, and show their
accuracy for systems of size up to $L=26$. As disorder strength is decreased, a
crossover to the thermalizing phase occurs. To establish the ultimate fate of
the non-ergodic regime in the thermodynamic limit, we develop a novel approach
for describing many-body processes that are usually neglected by RSRG,
accessing systems of size $L>2000$. We characterize the resonances that arise
due to such processes, finding that they involve an ever growing number of
spins as the system size is increased. The probability of finding resonances
grows with the system size. Even at strong disorder, we can identify a large
lengthscale beyond which resonances proliferate. Presumably, this eventually
would drive the system to a thermalizing phase. However, the extremely long
thermalization time scales indicate that a broad non-ergodic regime will be
observable experimentally. Our study demonstrates that symmetries control
dynamical properties of disordered, many-body systems. The approach introduced
here provides a versatile tool for describing a broad range of disordered
many-body systems.

margin-based Pareto deep ensemble pruning (MBPEP) model is proposed. It
achieves the high-quality uncertainty estimation with a small value of the
prediction interval width (MPIW) and a high confidence of prediction interval
coverage probability (PICP) by using deep ensemble networks. In addition to
these networks, unique loss functions are proposed, and these functions make
the sub-learners available for standard gradient descent learning. Furthermore,
the margin criterion fine-tuning-based Pareto pruning method is introduced to
optimize the ensembles. Several experiments including predicting uncertainties
of classification and regression are conducted to analyze the performance of
MBPEP. The experimental results show that MBPEP achieves a small interval width
and a low learning error with an optimal number of ensembles. For the
real-world problems, MBPEP performs well on input datasets with unknown
distributions datasets incomings and improves learning performance on a multi

brightness (V$\sim$7-8) and large angular size of 0.33 arcsec during its
apparitions. Iris is believed to belong to the category of large unfragmented
asteroids that avoided internal differentiation, implying that its current
shape and topography may record the first few 100 Myr of the solar system's
collisional evolution. We recovered information about the shape and surface
topography of Iris from disk-resolved VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL images acquired in the
frame of our ESO large program. We used the All-Data Asteroid Modeling (ADAM)
shape reconstruction algorithm to model the 3D shape of Iris, using optical
disk-integrated data and disk-resolved images from SPHERE as inputs. We
analyzed the SPHERE images to infer the asteroid's global shape and the
morphology of its main craters. We present the volume-equivalent diameter
D$_{{\rm eq}}$=214$\pm$5 km, and bulk density $\rho$=2.7$\pm$0.3 g cm$^{-3}$ of
Iris. Its shape appears to be consistent with that of an oblate spheroid with a
large equatorial excavation. We identified eight putative surface features
20--40 km in diameter detected at several epochs, which we interpret as impact
craters. Craters on Iris have depth-to-diameter ratios that are similar to
those of analogous 10 km craters on Vesta. The bulk density of Iris is
consistent with that of its meteoritic analog, namely LL ordinary chondrites.
Considering the absence of a collisional family related to Iris and the number
of large craters on its surface, we suggest that its equatorial depression may
be the remnant of an ancient (at least 3 Gyr) impact. Iris's shape further
opens the possibility that large planetesimals formed as almost perfect oblate
spheroids. Finally, we attribute the difference in crater morphology between
Iris and Vesta to their different surface gravities.

quantum system, $E_{\rm gs} \leqslant \langle \Psi|H| \Psi \rangle$, is
well-known (here $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the system and $\Psi$ is an
arbitrary wave function). Much less known are variational {\it lower} bounds on
the ground state. We consider one such bound which is valid for a many-body
translation-invariant lattice system. Such a lattice can be divided into
clusters which are identical up to translations. The Hamiltonian of such a
system can be written as $H=\sum_{i=1}^M H_i$, where a term $H_i$ is supported
on the $i$'th cluster. The bound reads $E_{\rm gs}\geqslant M
\inf\limits_{\rho_{cl} \in {\mathbb S_{cl}^G}} {\rm tr}_{cl}\rho_{cl} \, H_{cl}
$, where ${\mathbb S_{cl}^G}$ is some wisely chosen set of reduced density
matrices of a single cluster. The implementation of this latter variational
principle can be hampered by the difficulty of parameterizing the set $\mathbb
M$, which is a necessary prerequisite for a variational procedure. The root
cause of this difficulty is the nonlinear positivity constraint $\rho>0$ which
is to be satisfied by a density matrix. The squaring parametrization of the
density matrix, $\rho=\tau^2/{\rm tr}\,\tau^2$, where $\tau$ is an arbitrary
(not necessarily positive) Hermitian operator, accounts for positivity
automatically. We discuss how the squaring parametrization can be utilized to
find variational lower bounds on ground states of translation-invariant
many-body systems. As an example, we consider a one-dimensional Heisenberg
antiferromagnet.

biased to taxicabs because they are almost always online for GPS tracking. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework for the citywide traffic volume
inference using both dense GPS trajectories and incomplete trajectories
captured by camera surveillance systems. Our approach employs a high-fidelity
traffic simulator and deep reinforcement learning to recover full vehicle
movements from the incomplete trajectories. In order to jointly model the
recovered trajectories and dense GPS trajectories, we construct spatiotemporal
graphs and use multi-view graph embedding to encode the multi-hop correlations
between road segments into real-valued vectors. Finally, we infer the citywide
traffic volumes by propagating the traffic values of monitored road segments to
the unmonitored ones through masked pairwise similarities. Extensive
experiments with two big regions in a provincial capital city in China verify
the effectiveness of our approach.

that necessitate the development of Demand Side Management (DSM). The main
objective of DSM is to achieve an aggregated consumption pattern that is
efficient in terms of energy cost reduction, welfare maximization and
satisfaction of network constraints. This is generally envisaged by encouraging
electricity use at low-peak times. In this paper, we consider a system with
strategic, price anticipating consumers with private preferences that choose
their electricity consumption patterns so as to maximize their own benefit. In
this context, we take on the problem of coordinating the consumers' consumption
behavior without sacrificing their welfare (Quality of Experience). In order to
tackle this problem, we draw on concepts of indirect mechanism design and
propose a DSM architecture that is able to fulfill specific system-wide
constraints (e.g. energy cost reduction) and simultaneously achieve welfare
that is very close to optimal. The proposed billing rule preserves both the
budget-balance and the individual rationality properties. According to our
evaluation, the proposed DSM architecture achieves a close to optimal
allocation (1%-3% gap), compared to an ""optimal"" system that would use central
optimization of user loads without user consensus or protection of their

the maximum mass-loss rate achieved during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)

the superwind phase is too short for these stars to become white dwarfs. Here,
we report on the detection of spiral structures around two cornerstone extreme
OH/IR-stars, OH26.5+0.6 and OH30.1-0.7, identifying them as wide binary

superwind phase, thereby solving the decades-old conundrum. This discovery
restricts the maximum mass-loss rate of AGB stars around the single-scattering

lies in some \pema. The tight cut decomposition of a matching covered graph $G$
yields a list of bricks and braces; as per a theorem of
Lov{\'a}sz~\cite{lova87}, this list is unique (up to multiple edges); $b(G)$
denotes the number of bricks, and $c_4(G)$ denotes the number of braces that
are isomorphic to the cycle $C_4$ (up to multiple edges).
  Two edges $e$ and $f$ are mutually dependent if, for each perfect matching
$M$, $e \in M$ if and only if $f \in M$; Carvalho, Lucchesi and Murty
investigated this notion in their landmark paper~\cite{clm99}. For any matching
covered graph $G$, mutual dependence is an equivalence relation, and it
partitions $E(G)$ into equivalence classes; this equivalence class partition is
denoted by $\mathcal{E}_G$ and we refer to its parts as equivalence classes of
$G$; we use $\varepsilon(G)$ to denote the cardinality of the largest
equivalence class.
  The operation of `splicing' may be used to construct bigger matching covered
graphs from smaller ones; see~\cite{lckm18}; `tight splicing' is a stronger
version of `splicing'. (These are converses of the notions of `separating cut'
and `tight cut'.) In this article, we answer the following basic question: if a
matching covered graph $G$ is obtained by `splicing' (or by `tight splicing')
two smaller matching covered graphs, say~$G_1$~and~$G_2$, then how is
$\mathcal{E}_G$ related to $\mathcal{E}_{G_1}$ and to $\mathcal{E}_{G_2}$ (and
vice versa)?
  As applications of our findings: firstly, we establish tight upper bounds on
$\varepsilon(G)$ in terms of $b(G)$ and $c_4(G)$; secondly, we answer a recent
question of He, Wei, Ye and Zhai~\cite{hwyz19}, in the affirmative, by
constructing graphs that have arbitrarily high $\kappa(G)$~and~$\varepsilon(G)$
simultaneously, where $\kappa(G)$ denotes the vertex-connectivity.

ultracold atomic gases, but also between quasiparticles such as microcavity

Here we show that a bound state, despite being resonantly coupled to a
scattering state, becomes protected from decay whenever the relative phase is a
multiple of $\pi$. We observe this phenomenon by measuring lifetimes spanning
four orders of magnitude for FFR of spin-orbit excited molecular ions with
merged beam and electrostatic trap experiments. Our results provide a blueprint

a mixture of different underlying particle production mechanisms such as a

observed at the LHC could be part of the solution for the lack of muon
production in simulations of high energy cosmic rays. To probe this hypothesis,
we study hadronization in high energy hadron collisions using calorimetric
information over a large range of pseudorapidity in combination with the
multiplicity of central tracks. As an experimental observable, we propose the
production of energy in electromagnetic particles versus hadrons, as a function
of pseudorapidity and central charged particle multiplicity.

concerns with the uniqueness of an unstable periodic orbit (PO) for a given
binary code (modulo symmetry equivalence). In this paper, a finite level ($N$)
surface defined by the binary coding of the orbit is considered over the
initial value domain $D_0$. It is proved that a tiling of $D_0$ by base ribbons
of the surface steps is proper; the surface height increases monotonously when
ribbons are traversed from left to right. The mechanism of level $N+1$ tiling
creation from $N$ one is clarified. Two cases are possible depending on the
code and the anisotropy. (A) Every ribbon shrinks to a line at $N \rightarrow
\infty$. Here the uniqueness holds. (B) When future (F) and past (P) ribbon
become tangent each other, they escape from shrinking, Then, the initial values
of a stable PO ($S$) and an unstable PO ($U$) sharing the same code co-exist
inside the overlap of F and P non-shrinking ribbons. This case corresponds to
Broucke's PO. At high anisotropy, it is only case (A), but with decreasing
anisotropy, bifurcation $U(R) \rightarrow S(R) +U'(NR)$ occurs, along with the
emergence of a non-shrinking ribbon. (Here $R$ and $NR$ are short for
self-retracing and non-retracing PO respectively). We conjecture that case (B)
occurs only for odd rank, $Y$-symmetric POs from a classification based on
topology and symmetry. We report two applications. First, the classification is
applied successfully to the successive bifurcation (above bifurcation is

cosmological signal from the epoch of reionization (EoR), the foreground
spectra are assumed to be smooth. However, this assumption can be seriously
violated in practice since the unresolved or mis-subtracted foreground sources,
which are further complicated by the frequency-dependent beam effects of
interferometers, will generate significant fluctuations along the frequency
dimension. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep-learning-based method
that uses a 9-layer convolutional denoising autoencoder (CDAE) to separate the
EoR signal. After being trained on the SKA images simulated with realistic beam
effects, the CDAE achieves excellent performance as the mean correlation
coefficient ($\bar{\rho}$) between the reconstructed and input EoR signals
reaches $0.929 \pm 0.045$. In comparison, the two representative traditional
methods, namely the polynomial fitting method and the continuous wavelet
transform method, both have difficulties in modelling and removing the
foreground emission complicated with the beam effects, yielding only
$\bar{\rho}_{\text{poly}} = 0.296 \pm 0.121$ and $\bar{\rho}_{\text{cwt}} =
0.198 \pm 0.160$, respectively. We conclude that, by hierarchically learning
sophisticated features through multiple convolutional layers, the CDAE is a
powerful tool that can be used to overcome the complicated beam effects and
accurately separate the EoR signal. Our results also exhibit the great
potential of deep-learning-based methods in future EoR experiments.

world. Classical particles are distinguishable objects, individuated by
physical characteristics. By contrast, in quantum mechanics the standard view
is that particles of the same kind (""identical particles"") are in all
circumstances indistinguishable from each other. This indistinguishability
doctrine is motivated by the (anti)symmetrization postulates together with the
assumption (``factorism'') that each single particle is represented in exactly
one factor space in the tensor product Hilbert space of a many-particles
system.
  Although the factorist assumption is standard in the literature, it is
conceptually problematic. Particle indistinguishability is incompatible with
the everyday meaning of ``particle'', and also with how this term is used both
in classical physics and in the experimental practice of physics. The standard
view requires quantum particles of the same kind to remain indistinguishable
even in the classical limit, so that a transition to the classical picture of
the world seems impossible.
  Earlier we have proposed an alternative conception of quantum particles that
does not rely on factorism and that avoids these and other problems. We further
explain and develop this proposal here. In our view, particles in quantum
theory are not fundamental but \emph{emergent}. However, in those situations
where the particle concept is applicable, quantum particles---identical or
not---are distinguishable in the same way as classical particles.

Resonances (MMR) with nearby moons to the J1407b ring system were the cause of

0.63AU (corresponding to a 2:1 MMR) was found to form a gap at 0.4AU over short
time periods of less than 100yr. However, the proximity of a low mass moon
(0.08 Earth masses) caused significant scattering of the outer ring edge at
0.6AU, along with the formation of an additional gap at the 3:2 MMR (0.485 AU),
which is not consistent with observations. Further models with moons located at
MMR 3:1, 4:1, 7:3 and 5:3 failed to form gaps at 0.4AU for time periods less
than 100yr. Instead, gaps were formed in the ring at 3:2 and 2:1 MMR which
resulted in gaps at radial locations between 0.44-0.56AU. Additionally, gaps
also take longer than one orbital period of J1407b about the primary to form.
Given that J1407b is on a highly eccentric orbit and is thought to strongly
perturb the ring at apocentre it appears unlikely that gaps form due to MMR
with nearby moons as opposed to embedded moons. Including an appropriate total
mass of the ring equal to Earth a dampening effect was witnessed on the gap
formation process, causing an increase in the time required to open a gap due
to MMR. Therefore, we conclude the observed gap at 0.4 AU is unlikely to be
caused by MMR with nearby moons.

birds can react differently depending on their local environment during the
collective decision-making process, and these variable reactions can be a
source of complex spatiotemporal flocking dynamics. Here, we extend the
deterministic Cucker-Smale model by including the individual's reaction to
neighbors' acceleration where the reaction time depends on the local state of
polarity. Simulation results show that the adaptive reaction of individuals
induces the collective response of the flock. Birds are not frozen in a
complete synchronization but remain sensitive to perturbations coming from
environments. We confirm that the adaptivity of the reaction also generates
natural fluctuations of orientation and speed, both of which are indeed
scale-free as experimentally reported. This work may provide essential insight

classes and as a function of the deuteron transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$).
The measurements are discussed in the context of hadron-coalescence models. The
coalescence parameter $B_{2}$, extracted from the measured spectra of
(anti-)deuterons and primary (anti-)protons, exhibits no significant
$p_{\rm{T}}$-dependence for $p_{\rm{T}} < 3$ GeV/$c$, in agreement with the
expectations of a simple coalescence picture. At fixed transverse momentum per
nucleon, the $B_{2}$ parameter is found to decrease smoothly from low
multiplicity pp Pb-Pb collisions, in qualitative agreement with more elaborate
coalescence models. The measured mean transverse momentum of (anti-)deuterons
in pp is not reproduced by the Blast-Wave model calculations that
simultaneously describe pion, kaon and proton spectra, in contrast to central
Pb-Pb collisions. The ratio between the $p_{\rm{T}}$-integrated yield of
deuterons to protons, d/p, is found to increase with the charged-particle
multiplicity, as observed in inelastic pp collisions at different

a multi-relational learning task for predicting nodes labels based on their
relations within the network. In sparse networks, this prediction task can be
very challenging when only implicit feedback information is available such as
in predicting user interests in social networks. Current approaches rely on
learning per-node latent representations by utilizing the network structure,
however, implicit feedback relations are naturally sparse and contain only
positive observed feedbacks which mean that these approaches will treat all
observed relations as equally important. This is not necessarily the case in
real-world scenarios as implicit relations might have semantic weights which
reflect the strength of those relations. If those weights can be approximated,
the models can be trained to differentiate between strong and weak relations.

matrix factorization model with Bayesian personalized ranking loss for network
classification that utilizes basic transitive node similarity function for

shown that early type galaxies and globular clusters are no exception. Yet the
linear response of spheroidal rotating stellar systems has seldom been studied.
This paper takes a step in this direction by considering the behaviour of
spherically symmetric systems with differential rotation. Specifically, the
stability of several sequences of Plummer spheres is investigated, in which the
total angular momentum, as well as the degree and flavour of anisotropy in the
velocity space are varied. To that end, the response matrix method is
customised to spherical rotating equilibria. The shapes, pattern speeds and
growth rates of the systems' unstable modes are computed. Detailed comparisons
to appropriate N-body measurements are also presented. The marginal stability
boundary is charted in the parameter space of velocity anisotropy and rotation
rate. When rotation is introduced, two sequences of growing modes are
identified corresponding to radially and tangentially-biased anisotropic
spheres respectively. For radially anisotropic spheres, growing modes occur on
two intersecting surfaces (in the parameter space of anisotropy and rotation),
which correspond to fast and slow modes, depending on the net rotation rate.
Generalised, approximate stability criteria are finally presented.

the node degree and edge dimension sequences, generalizing the classical dyadic
configuration model. We provide a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme for sampling
from these models, and discuss connections and distinctions between our
proposed models and previous approaches. We then illustrate these models
through a triplet of applications. We start with two classical network topics
-- triadic clustering and degree-assortativity. In each, we emphasize the
importance of randomizing over hypergraph space rather than projected graph
space, showing that this choice can dramatically alter statistical inference
and study findings. We then define and study the edge intersection profile of a
hypergraph as a measure of higher-order correlation between edges, and derive
asymptotic approximations under the stub-labeled null. Our experiments
emphasize the ability of explicit, statistically-grounded polyadic modeling to
significantly enhance the toolbox of network data science. We close with

problem of reconstructing the full 3D mesh of a human hand from a single RGB

RGB or/and depth image data, HAMR can provide a more expressive and useful mesh
representation for monocular hand image understanding. In particular, the mesh
representation is achieved by parameterizing a generic 3D hand model with shape
and relative 3D joint angles. By utilizing this mesh representation, we can
easily compute the 3D joint locations via linear interpolations between the
vertexes of the mesh, while obtain the 2D joint locations with a projection of
the 3D joints.To this end, a differentiable re-projection loss can be defined
in terms of the derived representations and the ground-truth labels, thus
making our framework end-to-end trainable.Qualitative experiments show that our
framework is capable of recovering appealing 3D hand mesh even in the presence
of severe occlusions.Quantitatively, our approach also outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods for both 2D and 3D hand pose estimation from a

are available. One of the pairs of reactions is the same as used by Yadrovsky
i.e. $^{209}$Bi($p$, f) and $^{206}$Pb($\alpha$, f) leading to the CN

ratios in two different isospin states suggests that the CN seems to remember
its isospin at the point of formation. This possibility is further supported by
another method, where additional empirical evidence for four CN, viz.
$^{210}$Po, $^{209}$Bi, $^{207}$Bi, and $^{198}$Hg, is obtained from the

the non-interacting ground state. The protocol is optimized by minimizing the
excess energy at the end of the quench, or by maximizing the overlap with the

the optimal protocol exhibits fast oscillation and excites high energy modes.
In the limit of large $\tau$, minimizing energy requires a smooth protocol

result, WWAE does not suffer from the sampling burden and it is computationally
efficient by leveraging the reparameterization trick. Numerical results

consistency level for building such platforms. TCC avoids many anomalies of
eventual consistency, eschews the synchronization costs of strong consistency,
and supports interactive read-write transactions. Partial replication is
another attractive design choice for building geo-replicated platforms, as it
increases the storage capacity and reduces update propagation costs. This paper
presents PaRiS, the first TCC system that supports partial replication and
implements non-blocking parallel read operations, whose latency is paramount
for the performance of read-intensive applications. PaRiS relies on a novel
protocol to track dependencies, called Universal Stable Time (UST). By means of
a lightweight background gossip process, UST identifies a snapshot of the data
that has been installed by every DC in the system. Hence, transactions can
consistently read from such a snapshot on any server in any replication site
without having to block. Moreover, PaRiS requires only one timestamp to track
dependencies and define transactional snapshots, thereby achieving resource
efficiency and scalability. We evaluate PaRiS on a large-scale AWS deployment
composed of up to 10 replication sites. We show that PaRiS scales well with the
number of DCs and partitions, while being able to handle larger data-sets than
existing solutions that assume full replication. We also demonstrate a

To this end, they deploy many resources, e.g. receptors, downstream signaling
molecules, time and energy. Here, we present a theory for the optimal design of
a large class of sensing systems that need to detect time-varying signals, a
receptor driving a push-pull network. The theory is based on the concept of the
dynamic input-output relation, which describes the mapping between the current
ligand concentration and the average receptor occupancy over the past
integration time. This concept is used to develop the idea that the cell
employs its push-pull network to estimate the receptor occupancy and then uses
this estimate to infer the current ligand concentration by inverting the
dynamic input-output relation. The theory reveals that the sensing error can be
decomposed into two terms: the sampling error in the estimate of the receptor
occupancy and the dynamical error that arises because the average ligand
concentration over the past integration time may not reflect the current ligand
concentration. The theory generalizes the design principle of optimal resource
allocation previously identified for static signals, which states that in an
optimally designed sensing system the three fundamental resource classes of
receptors and their integration time, readout molecules, and energy are equally
limiting so that no resource is wasted. However, in contrast to static signals,
receptors and power cannot be traded freely against time to reach a desired
sensing precision: there exists an optimal integration time that maximizes the
sensing precision, which depends on the number of receptors, the receptor
correlation time, and the correlation time and variance of the input signal.
Applying our theory to the chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli indicates that
this bacterium has evolved to optimally sense shallow gradients.

the initially strong magnetic field, however, in our models an observable
magnetic field is still maintained as the star evolves towards the red

is modest. Magnetic braking greatly enhances chemical element mixing if radial
differential rotation is allowed for, on the other hand, the inclusion of
surface magnetic fields yields a lower surface enrichment in the case of near
solid-body rotation. Models including surface magnetic fields show notably

(2) the extent to which generated assembly code changes syntactically due to
triggering of the bug; and (3) how much such changes do cause regression test
suite failures and could be used to manually trigger divergences during
execution. The study is conducted with respect to the compilation of more than
10 million lines of C/C++ code from 309 Debian packages, using 12% of the
historical and now fixed miscompilation bugs found by four state-of-the-art
fuzzers in the Clang/LLVM compiler, as well as 18 bugs found by human users
compiling real code or by formal verification. The results show that almost
half of the fuzzer-found bugs propagate to the generated binaries for some
packages, but rarely affect their syntax and cause two failures in total when
running their test suites. User-reported and formal verification bugs do not
exhibit a higher impact, with less frequently triggered bugs and one test
failure. Our manual analysis of a selection of bugs, either fuzzer-found or

shield to block the innermost X-ray emission regions and absorb both soft and
hard X-ray photons. The absorbed X-ray emission will be re-radiated as a much
softer blackbody X-ray spectrum. Hence NGC 247 shows flux dips in the hard
X-ray band and transits from the SUL state to the SSUL state. The $\sim 200$s
transition timescale can be explained by the viscous timescale. According to
our model, the inner disc in the super-soft state is thicker and has smaller
viscous timescale than in the soft state. X-ray flux variability, which is
assumed to be driven by accretion rate fluctuations, might be viscous
time-scale invariant. Therefore, in the SSUL state, NGC 247 is more variable.
The bolometric luminosity is saturated in the thick disc; the observed
radius-temperature relation can therefore be naturally explained.

constrain the classification consistent with the class hierarchy and do not
need to reconstruct the feature vectors for different structures, we can
significantly reduce the computational cost compared to structural output
learning. Experimental results on two hierarchical text classification

of which are kinematic slow rotators (SRs). We allow the spherical anisotropy
parameter $\beta$ to be radially varying and allow a radial gradient in the
stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M_\star/L$) through the parameter $K$ introduced
earlier. The median anisotropy for SRs depends on $K$ as follows:
$\langle\beta_{\rm m}\rangle = a + b K$ with $a=0.19\pm 0.05$, $b=-0.13\pm
0.07$ ($\Lambda$CDM) or $a=0.21\pm 0.05$, $b=-0.26\pm 0.08$ (MOND), where
$\beta_{\rm m}$ refers to the radially averaged quantity. Under the
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm this scaling is tied to a scaling of $\langle f_{\rm
DM}\rangle = (0.16\pm 0.03) +(0.31\pm 0.06) K$, where $f_{\rm DM}$ refers to
the DM fraction within a sphere of $r=R_{\rm e}$. For $K=0$ (constant
$M_\star/L$), we obtain radially biased results with $\langle\beta_{\rm
m}\rangle \approx 0.2$ consistent with previous results. However, marginalizing
over $0 < K < 1.5$ yields $\langle\beta_{\rm m}\rangle = 0.06 ^{+0.11}_{-0.14}$
with $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle = 0.35 \pm 0.08$: isotropy is preferred. This
isotropy hides the fact that $\beta_{\rm m}$ is correlated with kinematic
features such as counter rotating cores (CRCs), kinematically distinct cores
(KDCs), and low-level velocities (LVs): SRs with LVs are likely to be radially
biased while SRs with CRCs are likely to be tangentially biased, and SRs with
KDCs are intermediate. Existing cosmological simulations allow us to understand
these results qualitatively in terms of their dynamical structures and
formation histories although there exist quantitative tensions. More realistic
cosmological simulations, particularly allowing for $M_\star/L$ gradients, may
be required to better understand SRs.

Data classification problems, fuzzy rule-based classifiers have not been able
to maintain the good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability that has
characterized these techniques in non-Big Data environments. The most accurate
methods build too complex models composed of a large number of rules and fuzzy
sets, while those approaches focusing on interpretability do not provide
state-of-the-art discrimination capabilities. In this paper, we propose a new
distributed learning algorithm named CFM-BD to construct accurate and compact
fuzzy rule-based classification systems for Big Data. This method has been
specifically designed from scratch for Big Data problems and does not adapt or
extend any existing algorithm. The proposed learning process consists of three
stages: 1) pre-processing based on the probability integral transform theorem;
2) rule induction inspired by CHI-BD and Apriori algorithms; 3) rule selection
by means of a global evolutionary optimization. We conducted a complete
empirical study to test the performance of our approach in terms of accuracy,
complexity, and runtime. The results obtained were compared and contrasted with
four state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers for Big Data (FBDT, FMDT, Chi-Spark-RS,

property; they are linear symbol-based discrete systems, and thus they present
an opportunity to test in a comparative context the predictions of CoHSI. Here,
without any consideration of, or relevance to, their role in specifying
function, we identify that 10 representative genomes (from microbes to human)
and a large collection of software contain identically structured nested
subsystems. In the case of base sequences in genomes, CoHSI predicts that if we
split the genome into n-tuples (a 2-tuple is a pair of consecutive bases; a
3-tuple is a trio and so on), without regard for whether or not a region is
coding, then each collection of n-tuples will constitute a homogeneous discrete
system and will obey a power-law in frequency of occurrence of the n-tuples. We
consider 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-tuples of ten species and demonstrate
that the predicted power-law behavior is emphatically present, and furthermore
as predicted, is insensitive to the start window for the tuple extraction i.e.
the reading frame is irrelevant.
  We go on to provide a proof of Chargaff's second parity rule and on the basis
of this proof, predict higher order tuple parity rules which we then identify
in the genome data.
  CoHSI predicts precisely the same behavior in computer software. This
prediction was tested and confirmed using 2-, 3- and 4-tuples of the

in binary neutron star merger events, according to both numerical simulations
and the multi-messenger observation of GW170817. The lifetime and evolution of
such a differentially rotating star, is tightly related to the observations in
the post-merger phase. Various studies on the maximum mass of differentially
rotating neutron stars have been done in the past, most of which assume the
so-called $j$-const law as the rotation profile inside the star and consider
only neutron star equations of state. In this paper, we extend the studies to
strange star models, as well as to a new rotation profile model. Significant
differences are found between differentially rotating strange stars and neutron
stars, with both differential rotation laws. A moderate differential rotation
rate for neutron stars is found to be too large for strange stars, resulting in
a rapid drop in the maximum mass as the differential rotation degree is
increased further from $\hat{A}\sim2.0$, where $\hat{A}$ is a parameter
characterizing the differential rotation rate for $j$-const law. As a result
the maximum mass of a differentially rotating self-bound star drops below the
uniformly rotating mass shedding limit for a reasonable degree of differential
rotation. The continuous transition to the toroidal sequence is also found to
happen at a much smaller differential rotation rate and angular momentum than
for neutron stars. In spite of those differences, $\hat{A}$-insensitive
relation between the maximum mass for a given angular momentum is still found
to hold, even for the new differential rotation law. Astrophysical consequences
of these differences and how to distinguish between strange star and neutron
star models with future observations are also discussed.

between the layers. In this work, using atomic-resolution electron microscopy,
we resolve the basal dislocation core structure in Bi_{2}Te_{3}, quantifying
the disregistry of the atomic planes across the core. We show that, despite the
existence of a stable stacking fault in the basal plane gamma surface, the
dislocation core spreading is mainly due to the weak bonding between the
layers, which leads to a small energy penalty for layer sliding parallel to the
van der Waals gap. Calculations within a semidiscrete variational
Peierls-Nabarro model informed by first-principles calculations support our
experimental findings.

genetics models are designed for exclusively clonal or sexual organisms. This
gap hampers our understanding of the influence of clonality on evolutionary
trajectories and the interpretation of population genetics data. We performed
forward simulations of diploid populations at increasing rates of clonality
(c), analysed their relationships with genotypic (clonal richness, R, and
distribution of clonal sizes, Pareto \beta) and genetic (FIS and linkage
disequilibrium) indices, and tested predictions of c from population genetics
data through supervised machine learning. Two complementary behaviours emerged
from the probability distributions of genotypic and genetic indices with
increasing c. While the impact of c on R and Pareto \beta was easily described
by simple mathematical equations, its effects on genetic indices were
noticeable only at the highest levels (c>0.95). Consequently, genotypic indices
allowed reliable estimates of c, while genetic descriptors led to poorer
performances when c<0.95. These results provide clear baseline expectations for
genotypic and genetic diversity and dynamics under partial clonality.
Worryingly, however, the use of realistic sample sizes to acquire empirical
data systematically led to gross underestimates (often of one to two orders of
magnitude) of c, suggesting that many interpretations hitherto proposed in the
literature, mostly based on genotypic richness, should be reappraised. We
propose future avenues to derive realistic confidence intervals for c and show
that, although still approximate, a supervised learning method would greatly
improve the estimation of c from population genetics data.

human-interpretable data. The conjunctivist framework - primarily developed by
Pietroski (2005, 2018) - obtains expressive representations with only a few
basic semantic types and relations systematically linked to syntactic
positions. While representational simplicity is crucial for computational
applications, such findings have not yet had major influence on NLP. We present
the first generic semantic representation format for NLP directly based on
these insights. We name the format EAT due to its basis in the Event-, Agent-,
and Theme arguments in Neo-Davidsonian logical forms. It builds on the idea
that similar tripartite argument relations are ubiquitous across categories,
and can be constructed from grammatical structure without additional lexical
information. We present a detailed exposition of EAT and how it relates to
other prevalent formats used in prior work, such as Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). EAT stands out in
two respects: simplicity and versatility. Uniquely, EAT discards semantic
metapredicates, and instead represents semantic roles entirely via positional
encoding. This is made possible by limiting the number of roles to only three;
a major decrease from the many dozens recognized in e.g. AMR and MRS. EAT's
simplicity makes it exceptionally versatile in application. First, we show that
drastically reducing semantic roles based on EAT benefits text generation from
MRS in the test settings of Hajdik et al. (2019). Second, we implement the
derivation of EAT from a syntactic parse, and apply this for parallel corpus
generation between grammatical classes. Third, we train an encoder-decoder LSTM
network to map EAT to English. Finally, we use both the encoder-decoder network
and a rule-based alternative to conduct grammatical transformation from

medical images. We demonstrate our method on the task of segmenting magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. Our method requires only a single
segmented scan, and leverages other unlabeled scans in a semi-supervised
approach. We learn a model of transformations from the images, and use the
model along with the labeled example to synthesize additional labeled examples.
Each transformation is comprised of a spatial deformation field and an
intensity change, enabling the synthesis of complex effects such as variations
in anatomy and image acquisition procedures. We show that training a supervised
segmenter with these new examples provides significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods for one-shot biomedical image segmentation. Our code

research community due to its potential applicability in the diverse
geographical condition over the globe with varying license plate parameters.
Any ALPR system includes three main modules, viz. localization of the license
plate, segmentation of the characters therein and recognition of the segmented
characters. In real life applications where the images are captured over days
and nights in an outdoor environment with varying lighting and weather
conditions, varying pollution level and wind turbulences, localization,
segmentation and recognition become challenging tasks. The tasks become more
complex if the license plate is not in conformity with the standards laid by
corresponding Motor Vehicles Department in terms of various features, e.g. area
and aspect ratio of the license plate, background color, foreground color,
shape, number of lines, font face/ size of characters, spacing between
characters etc. Besides, license plates are often dirty or broken or having
scratches or bent or tilted at its position. All these add to the challenges in
developing an effective ALPR system.

ferrofluid drop, which allows us to create millimeter-sized elastic capsules
that are highly deformable by inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We use a
combination of experimental and theoretical work in order to characterize and
quantify the deformation behavior of these ferrofluid-filled capsules. We
introduce a novel method for the direct encapsulation of unpolar liquids by
sodium alginate. The addition of polar alcohol molecules allows us to
encapsulate a ferrofluid as a single phase. This encapsulation method increases
the amount of encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles resulting in high
deformations and offers possible applications of capsules as actuators,
switches, or valves in confined spaces like microfluidic devices. We determine
both elastic moduli of the capsule shell, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio,
by employing two independent mechanical methods, spinning capsule measurements
and capsule compression between parallel plates. We then show that the observed
magnetic deformation can be fully understood from magnetic forces exerted by
the ferrofluid on the capsule shell if the magnetic field distribution and
magnetization properties of the ferrofluid are known. Using an iterative
solution scheme that couples a finite element / boundary element method for the
magnetic field calculation to the solution of the elastic shape equations, we
achieve quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for deformed
capsule shapes using the Young modulus from mechanical characterization and the
surface Poisson ratio as a fit parameter. This detailed analysis confirms the
results from mechanical characterization that the surface Poisson ratio of the
alginate shell is close to unity, that is, deformations of the alginate shell
are almost area conserving.

generalization to the complex field is of fundamental importance in all
practical applications that exploit the complex representation of the acquired
data. Moreover, the CES distributions has been widely recognized as a valuable
and general model to statistically describe the non-Gaussian behaviour of
datasets originated from a wide variety of physical measurement processes. The
paper is divided in two parts. In the first part, a closed form expression of
the constrained Semiparametric Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound (CSCRB) for the joint
estimation of complex mean vector and complex scatter matrix of a set of
CES-distributed random vectors is obtained by exploiting the so-called
\textit{Wirtinger} or $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{R}$-\textit{calculus}. The second part
deals with the derivation of the semiparametric version of the Slepian-Bangs
formula in the context of the CES model. Specifically, the proposed
Semiparametric Slepian-Bangs (SSB) formula provides us with a useful and
ready-to-use expression of the Semiparametric Fisher Information Matrix (SFIM)
for the estimation of a parameter vector parametrizing the complex mean and the
complex scatter matrix of a CES-distributed vector in the presence of unknown,
nuisance, density generator. Furthermore, we show how to exploit the derived
SSB formula to obtain the semiparametric counterpart of the Stochastic CRB for
Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation under a random signal model assumption.
Simulation results are also provided to clarify the theoretical findings and to
demonstrate their usefulness in common array processing applications.

is based on the argument by Killip-Stovall-Visan (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 364
(2012), no. 3, 1571--1631). However, since well-posedness in
$H^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}) \times H^{-1/2}(\mathbb{R})$ for NLKG with the exponential
nonlinearity holds only for small initial data, we use the $L_t^6
W^{s-1/2,6}_x$-norm for some $s>\frac{1}{2}$ instead of the $L_{t,x}^6$-norm,
where $W_x^{s,p}$ denotes the $s$-th order $L^p$-based Sobolev space.

  reconstruction-wise operation for upwind-biased schemes with free-stream
  preservation",,,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cases have shown that WENO schemes usually behave robustly on problems
containing shocks with high pressure ratios when uniformed or smooth grids are
present, while nonlinear schemes based on WENO interpolations might relatively
be liable to numerical instability. In the meanwhile, the latter have
manifested their advantages in computations on grids of bad quality, because
the free-stream preservation is easily realized there, and what is more
flux-splitting schemes with low dissipations can be engaged inherently as well.
Targeting at above dissatisfactions, a method by hybridizing WENO
implementations of interpolation and reconstruction-wise operation for
upwind-biased schemes with flux splitting employed is proposed and
corresponding third-, fifth- and seventh-order upwind-biased schemes are
proposed. Based on the understandings of [Q. Li, et al. Commun. Comput. Phys.
22 (2017) 64-94], the free-stream preservation of proposed schemes is achieved
with incorporation of frozen grid metrics in WENO reconstructions-wise
operations on split fluxes. In proposed schemes, flux-splitting schemes with
low dissipation can also be applied for the flux on a cell edge. As a
byproduct, an implementation of WENO scheme with free-stream preservation is
obtained. Numerical examples are provided as following with the third- and
fifth-order schemes being tested. In tests of free-stream preservation, the
property is achieved as expected (including two implementations of WENO). The
computation of 1-D Sod problem shows the capability of proposed schemes on
solving ordinary shock discontinuity. 2-D vortex preservation and double Mach
reflection are tested on uniformed and randomized grids. The accomplishment by
proposed schemes manifests their capability and robustness on solving problems
under rigorous circumstances.

is crucial for many scientific disciplines. A leading technique for solving
large-scale PDEs is using multigrid methods. At the core of a multigrid solver
is the prolongation matrix, which relates between different scales of the
problem. This matrix is strongly problem-dependent, and its optimal
construction is critical to the efficiency of the solver. In practice, however,
devising multigrid algorithms for new problems often poses formidable
challenges. In this paper we propose a framework for learning multigrid
solvers. Our method learns a (single) mapping from a family of parameterized
PDEs to prolongation operators. We train a neural network once for the entire
class of PDEs, using an efficient and unsupervised loss function. Experiments
on a broad class of 2D diffusion problems demonstrate improved convergence
rates compared to the widely used Black-Box multigrid scheme, suggesting that
our method successfully learned rules for constructing prolongation matrices.

propose a generative model to learn compact latent codes that can efficiently
represent and reconstruct a video sequence from its missing or under-sampled
measurements. We use a generative network that is trained to map a compact code
into an image. We first demonstrate that if a video sequence belongs to the
range of the pretrained generative network, then we can recover it by
estimating the underlying compact latent codes. Then we demonstrate that even
if the video sequence does not belong to the range of a pretrained network, we
can still recover the true video sequence by jointly updating the latent codes
and the weights of the generative network. To avoid overfitting in our model,
we regularize the recovery problem by imposing low-rank and similarity
constraints on the latent codes of the neighboring frames in the video
sequence. We use our methods to recover a variety of videos from compressive
measurements at different compression rates. We also demonstrate that we can
generate missing frames in a video sequence by interpolating the latent codes
of the observed frames in the low-dimensional space.

of utilizing more accurate symbols and elaborate length of successive

to further promote the estimation accuracy. Simulation results show in mild ISI
cases, the proposed MLISIC and IMLISIC algorithms can approximate the
theoretical performance even using 256-amplitude phase shift keying (APSK)
which is adopted in digital video broadcasting-satellite-second generation

about 0.03 dB when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. In other words, using the
proposed MLISIC and IMLISIC algorithms in mild ISI cases, the spectrum
efficiency can be improved with negligible BER performance degradation. In
moderate ISI cases, BER performance degradation of our proposed IMLISIC
algorithm is no more than 0.13 dB when adopting 64/128/256-APSK, which is still
satisfying. Besides, compared with existing symbol-based algorithms, the
greater BER performance improvement can be achieved under severer ISI

additional challenges in graph comparison and representation. Traditional
