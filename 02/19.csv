real world. While robot platforms provide means for interacting with the
physical world they cannot autonomously acquire object-level semantics without
needing human. In this paper, we investigate how to minimize human effort and
intervention to teach robots perform real world tasks that incorporate
semantics. We study this question in the context of visual servoing of mobile
robots and propose DIViS, a Domain Invariant policy learning approach for
collision free Visual Servoing. DIViS incorporates high level semantics from
previously collected static human-labeled datasets and learns collision free
servoing entirely in simulation and without any real robot data. However, DIViS
can directly be deployed on a real robot and is capable of servoing to the
user-specified object categories while avoiding collisions in the real world.
DIViS is not constrained to be queried by the final view of goal but rather is
robust to servo to image goals taken from initial robot view with high
occlusions without this impairing its ability to maintain a collision free
path. We show the generalization capability of DIViS on real mobile robots in
more than 90 real world test scenarios with various unseen object goals in
unstructured environments. DIViS is compared to prior approaches via real world
experiments and rigorous tests in simulation. For supplementary videos, see:

Here we introduce a protocol that scales down the coupling strength in a
quantum simulator based on a solid-state nuclear spin system, leading to a
longer decay time T2, while keeping perturbations associated to control error
constant. We can monitor quantum information scrambling by measuring two
powerful metrics, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Loschmidt Echoes
(LEs). While OTOCs reveal quantum information scrambling involving hundreds of
spins, the LE decay quantifies, via the time scale T3, how well the scrambled
information can be recovered through time reversal. We find that when the
interactions dominate the perturbation, the LE decay rate only depends on the
interactions themselves, T3 ~ T2, and not on the perturbation. Then, in an
unbounded many-spin system, decoherence can achieve a perturbation-independent
regime, with a rate only related to the local second moment of the Hamiltonian.

lowered effective spontaneous curvature of the leaflet being targeted. We

parametric description modeled after the neutron-star cooling phase. In
particular, our calculations use time-dependent neutrino spectra for all

account for the neutrino emission from the neutrino burst and accretion phases.
We find that the time-dependent treatment of the neutrino emission spectra
results in higher yields for the selected nuclei produced by the $\nu$~process
as compared to previous studies and also compared to the approximation of
assuming constant neutrino energies corresponding to the time-averaged mean
energy radiated in each species. The effect is largest for nuclides produced by
charged-current reactions. Our results reflect the dynamical competition
between neutrino-induced reactions and the effect of the shock passage through
the star. By varying the neutrino burst luminosity and the duration of the
accretion phase, we study the impact of these early emission phases and their
uncertainties on the $\nu$-process nucleosynthesis. We find that the deviation

functional theory, of the effects on the graphene bilayer when we intercalate
carbon atoms between the layers. We use the unit cell of the bilayer to
construct larger unit cells (supercells), positioning a single carbon atom in
the hollow position between the monolayers and periodically replicating the
supercell. By increasing the size of the unit cell and consequently, the
periodicity of the inserted atoms, we are able to minimize the carbon-carbon
interaction and therefore infer the changes in the electronic, vibrational and
thermal behavior of the bilayer when the intercalated atoms do not interact
with each other. The main result, concerning the electronic properties, is the
appearance of a doubly degenerate flat band at the Fermi level. These states
are interpreted as coming from the periodic deformation of the bilayer due to
the inserted atoms. It acts as a non-Abelian flux network creating zero energy
at bands as predicted by San-Jose, Gonz\'alez and Guinea in 2012. Since the
periodic strain field associated to the defect array has such a strong
influence on the electronic properties of the bilayer, it may be useful for
practical applications. For instance, it can act as frozen-in magnetic-like

applications. One intriguing property, important for many applications, is the
tunability of the band gap via compositional engineering. While experimental
reports on changes in absorption or photoluminescence show rather good
agreement for wide variety of compounds, the physical origins of these changes,
namely the variations in valence band and conduction band positions, are not
well characterized. Knowledge of these band positions is of importance for
optimizing the energy level alignment with charge extraction layers in
optoelectronic devices. Here, we determine ionization energy and electron
affinity values of all primary tin and lead based perovskites using
photoelectron spectroscopy data, supported by first-principles calculations.
Through analysis of the chemical bonding, we characterize the key energy levels
and elucidate their trends via a tight-binding analysis. We demonstrate that
energy level variations in perovskites are primarily determined by the relative
positions of the atomic energy levels of metal cations and halide anions.
Secondary changes in the perovskite energy levels result from the cation-anion
interaction strength, which depends on the volume and structural distortions of
the perovskite lattices. These results mark a significant step towards
understanding the electronic structure of this material class and provides the
basis for rational design rules regarding the energetics in perovskite
optoelectronics.

massive stars in the local Universe or massive primordial stars after the end
of the Cosmic Dark Ages. Hydrodynamic simulations of these explosions,
performed in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometry, have revealed the strong dependence of
mixing in the PISN ejecta on dimensionality. This chemical rearrangement is
mainly driven by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that start to grow shortly after
the collapse of the carbon-oxygen core. We investigate the effects of such
mixing on the spectroscopic evolution of PISNe by post-processing explosion
profiles with the radiation diffusion-equilibrium code SNEC and the implicit
Monte Carlo-discrete diffusion Monte Carlo (IMC-DDMC) radiation transport code
SuperNu. The first 3D radiation transport calculation of a PISN explosion is
presented yielding viewing angle-dependent synthetic spectra and lightcurves.
We find that while 2D and 3D mixing does not significantly affect the
lightcurves of PISNe, their spectroscopic and color evolution is impacted.
Strong features of intermediate mass elements dominated by silicon, magnesium
and oxygen appear at different phases and reach different intensities depending
on the extent of mixing in the silicon/oxygen interface of the PISN ejecta. On
the other hand, we do not find a significant dependence of PISN lightcurves and
spectra on viewing angle. Our results showcase the capabilities of SuperNu to
handle 3D radiation transport and highlight the importance of modeling
time-series of spectra in identifying PISNe with future missions.

are equivalent with respect to k-Q-IM-equivalence cannot be distinguished by a
refinement of k-tuples given by linear operators acting on vector spaces over
fields of characteristic p, for any p in Q. These equivalences first appeared
in the study of rank logic, but in fact they can be used to delimit the
expressive power of any extension of fixed-point logic with linear-algebraic
operators. We define an infinitary logic with k variables and all
linear-algebraic operators over finite vector spaces of characteristic p in Q
and show that the k-Q-IM-equivalence is the natural notion of elementary
equivalence for this logic.
  By means of a new and much deeper algebraic analysis of a generalized

Immerman, we prove that, as long as Q is not the set of all primes, there is no
k such that k-Q-IM-equivalence is the same as isomorphism. It follows that
there are polynomial-time properties of graphs which are not definable in the
infinitary logic with all Q-linear-algebraic operators and finitely many

linear-algebraic operators can capture PTIME, unless it includes such operators
for all prime characteristics. Our analysis requires substantial algebraic

architecture has a frontend for programming interface based on the concept of
event-driven simulation. The user program is executed as an event-driven
simulation using a hardware/software co-designed simulator. This is the
flexible part of the system. The back-end exploits the concept of uniform
topology as in a brain: a massive packet switched interconnection network with
flit credit-based flow control with virtual channels that incorporates
seamlessly communication, arithmetic and storage. Floating-point computations
are incorporated as on-line arithmetic operators in the output ports of the
switches as virtual arithmetic output channels, and storage as virtual input
channels. The front-end carries out the event-driven simulation of the user
program, and uses the arithmetic network for the hard floating-point work by
means of virtual dataflows. We expect to reduce significantly the needs of main
memory due to the execution model proposed, where variables are just virtual
interconnections in the network or signals stored in the virtual channels.
Moreover, we have the hypothesis that the problem size assigned to a
microprocessor should allow maximum concurrency and it should not be oversized.
This may lead to systems composed of microprocessors with main memory
incorporated in 3D chips. We identified several challenges that a research to
develop this microprocessor should address, and several hypothesis that should
be demonstrated by means of scientific evidence.

  Classification","Published in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters",,"10.1109/LGRS.2019.2918719",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is widely used for the analysis of
remotely sensed images. Hyperspectral imagery includes varying bands of images.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most frequently used deep
learning based methods for visual data processing. The use of CNN for HSI
classification is also visible in recent works. These approaches are mostly
based on 2D CNN. Whereas, the HSI classification performance is highly
dependent on both spatial and spectral information. Very few methods have
utilized the 3D CNN because of increased computational complexity. This letter
proposes a Hybrid Spectral Convolutional Neural Network (HybridSN) for HSI
classification. Basically, the HybridSN is a spectral-spatial 3D-CNN followed
by spatial 2D-CNN. The 3D-CNN facilitates the joint spatial-spectral feature
representation from a stack of spectral bands. The 2D-CNN on top of the 3D-CNN
further learns more abstract level spatial representation. Moreover, the use of
hybrid CNNs reduces the complexity of the model compared to 3D-CNN alone. To
test the performance of this hybrid approach, very rigorous HSI classification
experiments are performed over Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas Scene
remote sensing datasets. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art
hand-crafted as well as end-to-end deep learning based methods. A very
satisfactory performance is obtained using the proposed HybridSN for HSI
classification. The source code can be found at

subexponential in the sum of the lengths of words in $L$. The \emph{factor

of an {\em asymptotic} causal diamond (ACD): a causal diamond attached to the
conformal boundary of Minkowski space. The space of ACDs is defined by pairs of
points, one each on the future and past null boundaries, ${\cal I}^{\pm}$. We
observe that for flat space with an IR cut-off, this space (a) encodes a
preferred class of boundary ``subregions'', (b) is a plausible way to capture
holographic data for local bulk reconstruction, (c) has a natural
interpretation as the kinematic space for holography, (d) leads to a
holographic entanglement entropy in flat space that matches previous
definitions and satisfies strong sub-additivity, and, (e) has a bulk
union/intersection structure isomorphic to the one that motivated the
introduction of quantum error correction in AdS/CFT. By sliding the cut-off, we
also note one substantive way in which flat space holography differs from that

ultrasonic fields of complex spatial distribution inside the skull. Using
holographic lenses, we experimentally, numerically and theoretically produce
acoustic beams whose spatial distribution matches target structures of the
central nervous system. In particular, we produce three types of targets of
increasing complexity. First, a set of points are selected at the center of
both right and left human hippocampi. Experiments using a skull phantom and 3D
printed acoustic holographic lenses show that the corresponding bifocal lens
simultaneously focuses acoustic energy at the target foci, with good agreement
between theory and simulations. Second, an arbitrary curve is set as the target
inside the skull phantom. Using time-reversal methods the holographic beam
bends following the target path, in a similar way as self-bending beams do in
free space. Finally, the right human hippocampus is selected as a target
volume. The focus of the corresponding holographic lens overlaps with the
target volume in excellent agreement between theory in free-media, and
experiments and simulations including the skull phantom. The precise control of
focused ultrasound into the central nervous system is mainly limited due to the
strong phase aberrations produced by refraction and attenuation of the skull.
Using the present method, the ultrasonic beam can be focused not only at a
single point but overlapping one or various target structures simultaneously
using low-cost 3D-printed acoustic holographic lens. The results open new paths
to spread incoming biomedical ultrasound applications including blood-brain
barrier opening or neuromodulation.

estimation in partial differential equation (PDE) models with space-dependent

accurate and cost-effective alternatives to Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulation. We assume a parameterized Gaussian prior on the unknown functions,
and approximate the posterior density by a parameterized multivariate Gaussian
density. The parameters of the prior and posterior are estimated from sparse
observations of the PDE model's states and the unknown functions themselves by
maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), a lower bound on the log marginal
likelihood of the observations. The first method, Laplace-EM, employs the
expectation maximization algorithm to maximize the ELBO, with a Laplace
approximation of the posterior on the E-step, and minimization of a
Kullback-Leibler divergence on the M-step. The second method, DSVI-EB, employs
the doubly stochastic variational inference (DSVI) algorithm, in which the ELBO
is maximized via gradient-based stochastic optimization, with nosiy gradients
computed via simple Monte Carlo sampling and Gaussian backpropagation. We apply
these methods to identifying diffusion coefficients in linear and nonlinear
diffusion equations, and we find that both methods provide accurate estimates
of posterior densities and the hyperparameters of Gaussian priors. While the
Laplace-EM method is more accurate, it requires computing Hessians of the
physics model. The DSVI-EB method is found to be less accurate but only

error-correcting bit erasures) if it conserves its resources until the distant
future when the cosmic background temperature is very low. So perhaps aliens
are out there, but quietly waiting. Sandberg et al. implicitly assume, however,
that computer-generated entropy can only be disposed of by transferring it to
the cosmological background. In fact, while this assumption may apply in the
distant future, our universe today contains vast reservoirs and other physical
systems in non-maximal entropy states, and computer-generated entropy can be
transferred to them at the adiabatic conversion rate of one bit of negentropy
to erase one bit of error. This can be done at any time, and is not improved by
waiting for a low cosmic background temperature. Thus aliens need not wait to
be active. As Sandberg et al. do not provide a concrete model of the effect

persistent radio source associated with the first known repeating fast radio
burst, FRB 121102. Law et al. (2018) showed that FIRST J1419+3940 is a
transient source decaying in brightness over the last few decades. One possible
interpretation is that FIRST J1419+3940 is a nearby analogue to FRB 121102 and
that the radio emission represents a young magnetar nebula (as several
scenarios assume for FRB 121102). Another interpretation is that FIRST
J1419+3940 is the afterglow of an `orphan' long gamma-ray burst (GRB). The
environment is similar to where most such events are produced. To distinguish
between these hypotheses, we conducted radio observations using the European
VLBI Network at 1.6 GHz to spatially resolve the emission and to search for
millisecond-duration radio bursts. We detect FIRST J1419+3940 as a compact
radio source with a flux density of $620 \pm 20\ \mathrm{\mu Jy}$ (on 2018

These results confirm that the radio emission is non-thermal and imply an
average expansion velocity of $(0.10 \pm 0.02)c$. Contemporaneous
high-time-resolution observations using the 100-m Effelsberg telescope detected
no millisecond-duration bursts of astrophysical origin. The source properties
and lack of short-duration bursts are consistent with a GRB jet expansion,
whereas they disfavor a magnetar birth nebula.

property holds on random subsets of the original data. We study four
properties: if an itemset is closed, free, non-derivable or totally shattered,
and demonstrate how to compute the robustness analytically without actually
sampling the data. Our concept of robustness has many advantages: Unlike
statistical approaches for reducing patterns, we do not assume a null
hypothesis or any noise model and in contrast to noise tolerant or approximate
patterns, the robust patterns for a given property are always a subset of the
patterns with this property. If the underlying property is monotonic, then the
measure is also monotonic, allowing us to efficiently mine robust itemsets. We
further derive a parameter-free technique for ranking itemsets that can be used

action in $d=4$ ($O(N)$ in $d=2,3$) which dually describes the decomposition of
$\mathcal{H}_N$ into irreducible representations of the conformal group. This
$U(N)$ is a natural $N$-particle generalization of the single-particle $U(1)$
little group. The spectrum of primary operators is identified with the
harmonics of $N$-particle phase space which, specifically, is shown to be the
Stiefel manifold $V_2(\mathbb{C}^N) = U(N)/U(N-2)$ (respectively,
$V_2(\mathbb{R}^N)$, $V_1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ in $d=3,2$). Lorentz scalar primaries
are harmonics on the Grassmannian $G_2(\mathbb{C}^N) \subset
V_2(\mathbb{C}^N)$. We provide a recipe to construct these harmonic polynomials
using standard $U(N)$ ($O(N)$) representation theory. We touch upon
applications to effective field theory and numerical methods in quantum field
theory.

consistent with the zero scatter assumed by MOND, but at low masses the
intrinsic scatter is non-zero, strongly disfavoring MOND. Applying MOND to our
simulations yields remarkably good fits to most of the circular velocity

breaks down, predicting lower accelerations than observed and in our LCDM

rotation curves, zero intrinsic scatter in the RAR), are approximately, but not
exactly, true in LCDM. Thus if one wishes to go beyond Newtonian dynamics there
is more freedom in the RAR than assumed by MOND.

orders with discrete global symmetry, an important systematic approach is the
construction of exactly soluble lattice models. However, for continuous global
symmetry, in particular the electromagnetic $U(1)$, the lattice approach has
been less systematically developed. In this paper, we introduce a systematic
construction of effective theories for a large class of abelian topological
orders on three-dimensional spacetime lattice with electromagnetic background.
We discuss the associated topological properties, including the Hall
conductivity and the spin-c nature of the electromagnetic background. Some of
these effective spacetime lattice theories can be readily mapped to microscopic
Hamiltonians on spatial lattice; others may also shed light on their possible
microscopic Hamiltonian realizations. Our approach is based on the gauging of
$1$-form $\mathbb{Z}$ symmetries. Our construction is naturally related to the
continuum path integral of (doubled) $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory, through the
latter's formal description in terms of Deligne-Beilinson cohomology; when the
global symmetry is dropped, our construction can be reduced to the
Dijkgraaf-Witten model of associated abelian topological orders, as expected.

the regular rotation of a disk galaxy from the orbital motions of merging
galaxies with seeing-limited data. However, the merger fractions at $z\sim2$
are likely too low for this to have a large effect on measurements of disk
fractions. To determine how often mergers pass for disks, we look to galaxy
formation simulations. We analyze $\sim$24000 synthetic images and kinematic
maps of 31 high-resolution simulations of isolated galaxies and mergers at
$z\sim2$. We determine if the synthetic observations pass criteria commonly
used to identify disk galaxies, and whether the results are consistent with
their intrinsic dynamical states. Galaxies that are intrinsically mergers pass
the disk criteria for anywhere from 0 to 100$\%$ of sightlines. The exact
percentage depends strongly on the specific disk criteria adopted, and weakly
on the separation of the merging galaxies. Therefore, one cannot tell with
certainty whether observations of an individual galaxy indicate a merger or a
disk. To estimate the fraction of mergers passing as disks in current
kinematics samples, we combine the probability that a merger will pass as a
disk with theoretical merger fractions from a cosmological simulation. Taking
the latter at face-value, the observed disk fractions are overestimated by
small amounts: at most by $5\%$ at high stellar mass ($10^{10-11}$ M$_{\odot}$)

recover the known result that there exists a pressure range over which the gas
is multiphased, with the warm ($\sim 10^4$ K, WNM) and cold ($\sim 100$ K, CNM)
phases coexisting at the same pressure. At a metallicity $Z' \approx 0.1$, the
CNM is colder (compared to $Z'=1$) due to the reduced efficiency of
photoelectric heating. For $Z' \lesssim 0.1$, cosmic-ray ionization becomes the
dominant heating mechanism and the WNM-to-CNM transition shifts to ever
increasing pressure/density as the metallicity is reduced. For metallicities
$Z' \lesssim 0.01$, H$_2$ cooling becomes important, lowering the temperature
of the WNM (down to $\approx 600$ K), and smoothing out the multiphase
phenomenon. At vanishing metallicities, H$_2$ heating becomes effective and the
multiphase phenomenon disappears entirely. We derive analytic expressions for
the critical densities for the warm-to-cold phase transition in the different

applications such as remote surveillance and infrastructure mapping. Accurate
semantic processing of the acquired 3D point cloud is critical for allowing the
robot to obtain a high-level understanding of the surrounding objects and
perform context-aware decision making. Existing techniques for point cloud
semantic segmentation are mostly applied on a single-frame or offline basis,
with no way to integrate the segmentation results over time. This paper
proposes an online method for mobile robots to incrementally build a
semantically-rich 3D point cloud of the environment. The proposed deep neural
network, MCPNet, is trained to predict class labels and object instance labels
for each point in the scanned point cloud in an incremental fashion. A
multi-view context pooling (MCP) operator is used to combine point features
obtained from multiple viewpoints to improve the classification accuracy. The
proposed architecture was trained and evaluated on ray-traced scans derived
from the Stanford 3D Indoor Spaces dataset. Results show that the proposed
approach led to 15% improvement in point-wise accuracy and 7% improvement in
NMI compared to the next best online method, with only a 6% drop in accuracy
compared to the PointNet-based offline approach.

higher iron abundances derived from singly ionized species compared to neutral,
violating the ionization equilibrium under the assumption of local
thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we investigate the overabundances of
FeII lines reported in our previous work for a sample of 451 solar-type HARPS
stars in the solar neighborhood. The spectroscopic surface gravities of this
sample which emerge from the ionization balance, appear underestimated for the
K-type stars. In order to understand this behavior, we search our FeII line
list for unresolved blends and outliers. First, we use the VALD to identify
possible unresolved blends around our lines and calculate which ones are strong
enough to cause overestimations in the equivalent width measurements. Second,
for our sample we use reference parameters (effective temperature and
metallicity) and the Gaia DR2 parallaxes to derive surface gravities
(trigonometric gravities) and calculate the FeI and FeII abundances from
different line lists. We exclude the FeII lines which produce overabundances
above 0.10 dex. The derived surface gravities from the clean line list are now
in agreement with the trigonometric. Moreover, the difference between FeI and
FeII abundance does not show now a correlation with the effective temperature.
Finally, we show that the ionization balance of Ti can provide better estimates
of surface gravities than iron. With this analysis, we provide a solution to
the ionization balance problem observed in the atmospheres of cool dwarfs.

Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for robust locomotion, with the
capabilities of step location adjustment, Center of Mass (CoM) height

constraining the Zero Moment Point within the support polygon. By using the
nonlinear inverted pendulum plus flywheel model, the effects of upper-body
rotation and vertical height motion are considered. As a result, the NMPC is
formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program problem, which is
solved fast by sequential quadratic programming. Using this unified framework,
robust walking patterns that exploit reactive stepping, body inclination, and
CoM height variation are generated based on the state estimation. The
adaptability for bipedal walking in multiple scenarios has been demonstrated

effective way to reduce the thermal conductivity of thermoelectric materials

in silicon based nanostructured materials in the presence of nanocrystallinity
and nanopores at the range of 300 K to 900 K using a Monte Carlo simulation
approach. The thermal conductivity in the presence of nanocrystallinity follows
the same reduction trend as in the pristine material. We show, however, that
the relative reduction is stronger with temperature in the presence of
nanocrystallinity, a consequence of the wavevector dependent (q dependent)
nature of phonon scattering on the domain boundaries. In particular, as the
temperature is raised the proportion of large wavevector phonons increases.
Since these phonons are more susceptible to boundary scattering, we show that
compared to the wavevector independent thermal conductivity value this q
dependent surface scattering could account for even a approx. 40 per cent
reduction in the thermal conductivity of nanocrystalline Si. Introduction of
nanopores with randomized positions enhances this effect, which suggests that
hierarchical nanostructuring is actually more effective at high temperatures

numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations. The new
algorithm that solves the INS equations in a velocity-pressure reformulation is
based on a split-step scheme in conjunction with the standard finite-element
method. The split-step scheme employed for the temporal discretization of our
algorithm completely separates the pressure updates from the solution of
velocity variables. When the pressure equation is formed explicitly, the
algorithm avoids solving a saddle-point problem; therefore, our algorithm has
more flexibility in choosing finite-element spaces. For efficiency and
robustness, Lagrange finite elements of equal order for both velocity and
pressure are used. Motivated by a post-processing technique that calculates
derivatives of a finite element solution with super-convergent error estimates,
an alternative numerical boundary condition is proposed for the pressure
equation at the discrete level. The new numerical pressure boundary condition
that can be regarded as a better implementation of the compatibility boundary
condition improves the boundary-layer errors of the pressure solution.
Normal-mode analysis is performed using a simplified model problem on a uniform
mesh to demonstrate the numerical properties of our methods. Convergence study
using $\mathbb{P}_1$ elements confirms the analytical results and demonstrates
that our algorithm with the new numerical boundary condition achieves the
optimal second-order accuracy for both velocity and pressure up-to the
boundary. Benchmark problems are also computed and carefully compared with
existing studies. Finally, as an example to illustrate that our approach can be
easily adapted for higher-order finite elements, we solve the classical
flow-past-a-cylinder problem using $\mathbb{P}_n$ finite elements with $n\geq

Furthermore, present calculations show that for negative energy, particles

the J and K bands to map the distribution, excitation and kinematics of the
ionized HII and warm molecular gas H$_2$, in the inner few 100 pc of 6 nearby
active galaxies: NGC 788, Mrk 607, NGC 3227, NGC 3516, NGC 5506, NGC 5899. {For
most galaxies, this is the first time that such maps have been obtained}. The
ionized and H$_2$ gas show distinct kinematics: while the H$_2$ gas is mostly
rotating in the galaxy plane with low velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), the
ionized gas usually shows signatures of outflows associated with higher
$\sigma$ values, most clearly seen in the [FeII] emission line. These two gas
species also present distinct flux distributions: the H$_2$ is more uniformly
spread over the whole galaxy plane, while the ionized gas is more concentrated
around the nucleus and/or collimated along the ionization axis of its Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN), presenting a steeper gradient in the average surface
mass density profile than the H$_2$ gas. The total HII masses cover the range
$2\times10^5-2\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$, with surface mass densities in the range
3-150 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, while for the warm H$_2$ the values are 10$^{3-4}$
times lower. We estimate that the available gas reservoir is at least $\approx$
100 times more massive than needed to power the AGN. If this gas form new stars
the star-formation rates, obtained from the Kennicutt-schmidt scalling
relation, are in the range 1-260$\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. But
the gas will also - at least in part - be ejected in the form of the observed
otflows.

Hughes","Chandra observations of the Abell S0295 cluster","Accepted to ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab07b1",,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present deep ($205 \rm ks$), \Chandra observations of the \ab295 binary
merging cluster ($z=0.30$). In the X-ray image, the secondary component is
clearly visible as a surface brightness peak, while the primary cluster has a
flatter distribution. We found cool gas ($\sim 6 \rm keV$) associated with the
secondary, while the central temperature of the primary does not deviate
significantly from the mean temperature of the cluster of $\sim 9.5 \rm keV$.
In the vicinity of the primary's core we found the hottest region in the
cluster accompanied by a surface brightness discontinuity. We propose that this
region corresponds to a shock, for which we estimate a Mach number of
$1.24_{-0.22}^{+0.30}$. We found other merger signatures such as a plume of
cool gas emerging from the primary cluster and a cold front and a possible bow
shock (Mach number of $1.74_{-0.74}^{+1.02}$) leading the secondary cluster.
Based on the observed properties in comparison to binary merger simulations
from the literature we propose for \ab295 a low mass ratio, off-axis merging
scenario, with secondary close to first apocentre. Comparison of our results
with strong lensing observations of \ab295 from \cite{Cibirka2018} shows an
offset between the total mass peak and the bulk of the gas distribution in the
primary cluster. The properties of the merger and the existence of the offset
between mass peak and gas make \ab295 a promising candidate for the study of
mergers involving non-cool core clusters and the nature of dark matter.

positive cosmological constant can be obtained, respectively, by coupling this
solution to any model of a cosmological bounce and coupling the scalar field to
a sector that undergoes a technically natural phase transition at the meV
scale. A robust prediction of this model is a rolling scalar field today with
some coupling to the standard model. This can potentially be experimentally
probed in a variety of cosmological and terrestrial experiments, such as probes
of the equation of state of dark energy, birefringence in the cosmic microwave

"1902.06795","Tao Yu","B. M. Yao, T. Yu, Y. S. Gui, J. W. Rao, Y. T. Zhao, W. Lu, C.-M. Hu","Coherent control of magnon radiative damping with local photon states","9+7 pages, 4+2 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The collective excitation of ordered spins, known as spin waves or magnons,
can in principle radiate by emitting travelling photons to an open system when
decaying to the ground state. However, in contrast to the electric dipoles,
magnetic dipoles contributed by magnons are more isolated from electromagnetic
environment with negligible radiation in the vacuum, limiting their application
in coherent communication by photons. Recently, strong interaction between
cavity standing-wave photons and magnons has been reported, indicating the
possible manipulation of magnon radiation via tailoring photon states. Here,
with loading an yttrium iron garnet sphere in a one-dimensional circular
waveguide cavity in the presence of both travelling and standing photon modes,
we demonstrate an efficient photon emissions from magnon and a significant
magnon radiative damping with radiation rate found to be proportional to the
local density of states (LDOS) of photon. By modulating the LDOS including its
magnitude and/or polarization, we can flexibly tune the photon emission and
magnon radiative damping on demand. Our findings provide a general way in

work thus far has been mainly limited to single crystals because most
polarization transfer protocols are sensitive to misalignment between the NV

simultaneous presence of optical excitation and microwave frequency sweeps at
low magnetic fields. We show that a subtle interplay between illumination
intensity, frequency sweep rate, and hyperfine coupling strength leads to
efficient, sweep-direction-dependent 13C spin polarization over a broad range
of orientations of the magnetic field. In particular, our results strongly
suggest that finely-tuned, moderately coupled nuclear spins are key to the
hyperpolarization process, which makes this mechanism distinct from other known
dynamic polarization channels. These findings pave the route to applications
where powders are intrinsically advantageous, including the hyper-polarization
of target fluids in contact with the diamond surface or the use of
hyperpolarized particles as contrast agents for in-vivo imaging.

comprehensive than the five-moment equations with isotropic pressures and
significantly less expensive than the ten-moment equations with a full pressure
tensors. Similarly to the five- and ten-moment equations, the wave speeds are
naturally limited by the speed of light, which eliminates the issue of
unlimited whistler wave speeds present in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). It
is also possible to simulate multiple negatively charged fluids, which cannot
be done in MHD models. The six-moment model is a reasonable description of the
plasma outside magnetic reconnection regions and therefore well-suited to be
coupled with an embedded particle-in-cell model that covers the reconnection
region. Our numerical implementation uses a point-implicit scheme for the stiff
source terms, and we use a second-order accurate Rusanov-type scheme with
carefully selected wave speeds. For the plasma variables and the magnetic field
the maximum wave speed is based on the fast magnetosonic speed of MHD with
anisotropic pressures that we derive. For the electric field related variables

different motions result in a different set of events. For learning based tasks
based on a static scene such as classification which directly use the events,
we must either rely on the learning method to learn the underlying object

. Our approach greatly exceeds the magnitude of the best previously reported
change of conductivity in an oxide. Our method uses focused ion beam to produce
conductive zones with nanoscale resolution within the insulating Al2O3 matrix.
We investigated the source of conductivity modulation and identified
trap-assisted conduction in the ion damage-induced defects as the main charge
transport mechanism. Temperature-dependency of the conductivity and optical
characterization of the patterned areas offer further insight into the nature
of the conduction mechanism. We also show that the process is extremely
reproducible and robust against moderate annealing temperatures and chemical
environment. The record conductivity modulation, combined with the nanoscale
patterning precision allows the creation of conductive zones within a highly
insulating, mechanically hard, chemically inert, and bio-compatible matrix,
which could find broad applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and
medical implants

to achieve state of the art results in various tasks. The gains in performance
come at the cost of a substantial increase in computation and storage
requirements. This makes real-time implementations on limited resources
hardware a challenging task. One popular approach to address this challenge is
to perform low-bit precision computations via neural network quantization.
However, aggressive quantization generally entails a severe penalty in terms of
accuracy, and often requires retraining of the network, or resorting to higher
bit precision quantization. In this paper, we formalize the linear quantization
task as a Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) problem for both weights and
activations, allowing low-bit precision inference without the need for full
network retraining. The main contributions of our approach are the
optimizations of the constrained MSE problem at each layer of the network, the
hardware aware partitioning of the network parameters, and the use of multiple
low precision quantized tensors for poorly approximated layers. The proposed
approach allows 4 bits integer (INT4) quantization for deployment of pretrained
models on limited hardware resources. Multiple experiments on various network
architectures show that the suggested method yields state of the art results
with minimal loss of tasks accuracy.

  Approach to Seat Inventory Control and Overbooking",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Revenue management can enable airline corporations to maximize the revenue
generated from each scheduled flight departing in their transportation network
by means of finding the optimal policies for differential pricing, seat
inventory control and overbooking. As different demand segments in the market
have different Willingness-To-Pay (WTP), airlines use differential pricing,
booking restrictions, and service amenities to determine different fare classes
or products targeted at each of these demand segments. Because seats are
limited for each flight, airlines also need to allocate seats for each of these
fare classes to prevent lower fare class passengers from displacing higher fare
class ones and set overbooking limits in anticipation of cancellations and
no-shows such that revenue is maximized. Previous work addresses these problems
using optimization techniques or classical Reinforcement Learning methods. This
paper focuses on the latter problem - the seat inventory control problem -
casting it as a Markov Decision Process to be able to find the optimal policy.
Multiple fare classes, concurrent continuous arrival of passengers of different
fare classes, overbooking and random cancellations that are independent of
class have been considered in the model. We have addressed this problem using
Deep Q-Learning with the goal of maximizing the reward for each flight
departure. The implementation of this technique allows us to employ large
continuous state space but also presents the potential opportunity to test on
real time airline data. To generate data and train the agent, a basic
air-travel market simulator was developed. The performance of the agent in
different simulated market scenarios was compared against theoretically optimal
solutions and was found to be nearly close to the expected optimal revenue.

proper configuration of its architecture and hyperparameters. Such a
configuration is difficult and as a result, DNNs are often not used to their
full potential. In addition, DNNs in commercial applications often need to
satisfy real-world design constraints such as size or number of parameters. To
make configuration easier, automatic machine learning (AutoML) systems for deep

hyperparameters.
  This paper takes AutoML a step further. It introduces an evolutionary AutoML
framework called LEAF that not only optimizes hyperparameters but also network
architectures and the size of the network. LEAF makes use of both
state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and distributed computing
frameworks. Experimental results on medical image classification and natural
language analysis show that the framework can be used to achieve
state-of-the-art performance. In particular, LEAF demonstrates that
architecture optimization provides a significant boost over hyperparameter
optimization, and that networks can be minimized at the same time with little
drop in performance. LEAF therefore forms a foundation for democratizing and
improving AI, as well as making AI practical in future applications.

Greedy algorithms have been proposed to efficiently deal with high-dimensional
datasets while avoiding redundant inferences and capturing synergistic effects.
However, multiple statistical comparisons may inflate the false positive rate
and are computationally demanding, which limited the size of previous
validation studies. The algorithm we present---as implemented in the IDTxl
open-source software---addresses these challenges by employing hierarchical
statistical tests to control the family-wise error rate and to allow for
efficient parallelisation. The method was validated on synthetic datasets
involving random networks of increasing size (up to 100 nodes), for both linear
and nonlinear dynamics. The performance increased with the length of the time
series, reaching consistently high precision, recall, and specificity (>98% on
average) for 10000 time samples. Varying the statistical significance threshold
showed a more favourable precision-recall trade-off for longer time series.

high heat capacity, their meridional temperature gradient was shown to be
reversed for the entire year. The objective of this work is to investigate the
drastically different general circulation of such planets, with an emphasis on
the tropical Hadley circulation and the mid-latitude baroclinic eddy structure.
We use a 3D dry dynamic core model, accompanied by an eddy-free configuration
and a generalized 2D Eady model. When the meridional temperature gradient $T_y$
is reversed, the Hadley cell remains in the same direction, because the surface
wind pattern and hence the associated meridional Ekman transport are not
changed, as required by the baroclinic eddy momentum transport. The Hadley cell
under reversed $T_y$ also becomes much shallower and weaker, even when the
magnitude of the gradient is the same as in the normal case. The shallowness is
due to the bottom-heavy structure of the baroclinic eddies in the reverse case,
and the weakness is due to the weak wave activity. We propose a new mechanism
to explain the mid-latitude eddy structure for both cases, and verify it using
the generalized Eady model. With seasonal variations included, the annual mean
circulation resembles that under perpetual annual mean setup. Approaching the
solstices, a strong cross-equator Hadley cell forms in both cases, and about
2/3 of the Hadley circulation is driven by eddies, as shown by eddy-free
simulations and using a decomposition of the Hadley cell.

significantly enhance the physical layer performance. In this paper, we present
a DL based autoencoder for interference channel. Based on a characterization of
a k-user Gaussian interference channel, where the interferences are classified
as different levels from weak to very strong interferences based on a coupling
parameter {\alpha}, a DL neural network (NN) based autoencoder is designed to
train the data set and decode the received signals. The performance such a DL
autoencoder for different interference scenarios are studied, with {\alpha}
known or partially known, where we assume that {\alpha} is predictable but with
a varying up to 10\% at the training stage. The results demonstrate that DL
based approach has a significant capability to mitigate the effect induced by a
poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a high interference-to-noise ratio (INR).
However, the enhancement depends on the knowledge of {\alpha} as well as the
interference levels. The proposed DL approach performs well with {\alpha} up to
10\% offset for weak interference level. For strong and very strong
interference channel, the offset of {\alpha} needs to be constrained to less
than 5\% and 2\%, respectively, to maintain similar performance as {\alpha} is
known.

  Numerical Validation",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Downlink channel estimation in massive MIMO systems is well known to generate
a large overhead in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode as the amount of
training generally scales with the number of transmit antennas. Using instead
an extrapolation of the channel from the measured uplink estimates to the
downlink frequency band completely removes this overhead. In this paper, we
investigate the theoretical limits of channel extrapolation in frequency. We
highlight the advantage of basing the extrapolation on high-resolution channel
estimation. A lower bound (LB) on the mean squared error (MSE) of the
extrapolated channel is derived. A simplified LB is also proposed, giving
physical intuition on the SNR gain and extrapolation range that can be expected
in practice. The validity of the simplified LB relies on the assumption that
the paths are well separated. The SNR gain then linearly improves with the
number of receive antennas while the extrapolation performance penalty
quadratically scales with the ratio of the frequency and the training
bandwidth. The theoretical LB is numerically evaluated using a 3GPP channel
model and we show that the LB can be reached by practical high-resolution
parameter extraction algorithms. Our results show that there are strong
limitations on the extrapolation range than can be expected in SISO systems
while much more promising results can be obtained in the multiple-antenna
setting as the paths can be more easily separated in the delay-angle domain.

also provide a more general asymptotic theory for the spiked eigenvectors using
the bilinear form. Simulation studies verify the validity of our new

the hydrodynamic forces acting on a particle. A leading order model of the
forces within the cross-sectional plane is obtained through the use of a
rotating coordinate system and a perturbation expansion in the particle
Reynolds number of the disturbance flow. We predict the behaviour of neutrally
buoyant particles at low flow rates and examine the variation in focusing
position with respect to particle size and bend radius, independent of the flow
rate. In this regime, the lateral focusing position of particles approximately
collapses with respect to a dimensionless parameter dependent on three length
scales, specifically the particle radius, duct height, and duct bend radius.
Additionally, a trapezoidal shaped cross-section is considered in order to
demonstrate how changes in the cross-section design influence the dynamics of

state phases and an unusually large 25% collapse in volume from its delta phase
to its low temperature alpha phase via a series of structural transitions.
Despite considerable advances in our understanding of strong electronic
correlations within various structural phases of Pu and other actinides, the
thermodynamic mechanism responsible for driving the volume collapse has
continued to remain a mystery. Here we utilize the unique sensitivity of
magnetostriction measurements to unstable f electron shells to uncover the
crucial role played by electronic entropy in stabilizing delta-Pu against
volume collapse. We find that in contrast to valence fluctuating rare earths,
which typically have a single f electron shell instability whose excitations
drive the volume in a single direction in temperature and magnetic field,
delta-Pu exhibits two such instabilities whose excitations drive the volume in
opposite directions while producing an abundance of entropy at elevated
temperatures. The two instabilities imply a near degeneracy between several
different configurations of the 5f atomic shell, giving rise to a considerably
richer behavior than found in rare earth metals. We use heat capacity
measurements to establish a robust thermodynamic connection between the two

smooth bounded function of a chi-distributed random variable, divided by the

contexts of simultaneous inference, the selection and ranking of populations
and in the evaluation of multivariate t probabilities. It also arises in the
assessment of the coverage probability and expected volume properties of the
some non-standard confidence regions. We use a transformation put forward by
Mori, followed by the application of the trapezoidal rule. This rule has the
remarkable property that, for suitable integrands, it is exponentially
convergent. We use it to create a nested sequence of quadrature rules, for the
estimation of the approximation error, so that previous evaluations of the
integrand are not wasted. The application of the trapezoidal rule requires the
approximation of an infinite sum by a finite sum. We provide a new easily
computed upper bound on the error of this approximation. Our overall conclusion
is that this method is a very suitable candidate for the computation of the
coverage and expected volume properties of non-standard confidence regions.

separate from the study of the loss function being used. One avenue of inquiry
has been to look at these loss functions in terms of their properties as
scoring rules via the proper-composite representation, in which predictions are
mapped to probability distributions which are then scored via a scoring rule.
However, recent research so far has primarily been concerned with analysing the
(typically) finite-dimensional conditional risk problem on the output space,
leaving aside the larger total risk minimisation. We generalise a number of
these results to an infinite dimensional setting and in doing so we are able to
exploit the familial resemblance of density and conditional density estimation
to provide a simple characterisation of the canonical link.

fields, the relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian is derived including high
order terms describing new effects. The result obtained shows for the first
time that a twisted spin-1/2 particle possesses a tensor magnetic
polarizability and a measurable (spectroscopic) electric quadrupole moment. We
have calculated the former parameter and have evaluated the latter one for a
twisted electron. The tensor magnetic polarizability of the twisted electron
can be measured in a magnetic storage ring because a beam with an initial
orbital tensor polarization acquires a horizontal orbital vector polarization.
The electric quadrupole moment is rather large and strongly influences the
dynamics of the intrinsic orbital angular momentum. Three different methods of
its measurements, freezing the intrinsic orbital angular momentum and two
resonance methods, are proposed. The existence of the quadrupole moment of
twisted electrons can lead to practical applications.

underlying assets: a fast-scale on the order of days and a slow-scale on the
order of months. In our previous works, we have studied the portfolio
optimization problem in a Markovian setting under each single scale, the slow
one in [Fouque and Hu, SIAM J. Control Optim., 55 (2017), 1990-2023], and the
fast one in [Hu, Proceedings of IEEE CDC 2018, accepted]. This paper is
dedicated to the analysis when the two scales coexist in a Markovian setting.
We study the terminal wealth utility maximization problem when the volatility
is driven by both fast- and slow-scale factors. We first propose a zeroth-order
strategy, and rigorously establish the first order approximation of the
associated problem value. This is done by analyzing the corresponding linear
partial differential equation (PDE) via regular and singular perturbation
techniques, as in the single-scale cases. Then, we show the asymptotic
optimality of our proposed strategy within a specific family of admissible
controls. Interestingly, we highlight that a pure PDE approach does not work in
the multi-scale case and, instead, we use the so-called epsilon-martingale
decomposition. This completes the analysis of portfolio optimization in both
fast mean-reverting and slowly-varying Markovian stochastic environments.

it has proved that there is a fundamental rate-distance limit, named linear
bound, which limits the performance of all existing repeaterless protocols and
realizations. Surprisingly, a recently proposed protocol, called twin-field
(TF) QKD can beat linear bound with no need of quantum repeaters. Here, we
present the first implementation of TF-QKD protocol and demonstrate its
advantage of beating linear bound at the channel distance of 300 km. In our
experiment, a modified TF-QKD protocol which does not assume phase
post-selection is considered, and thus higher key rate than the original one is
expected. After well controlling the phase evolution of the twin fields
travelling hundreds of kilometers of optical fibres, the implemented system

problems, especially with uncertainty and incompleteness. However, Bayesian
inference is a computing-intensive task whose efficiency is physically limited

spintronics based stochastic computing approach is proposed for efficient

devices are exploited to build stochastic bitstream generator (SBG) for
stochastic computing with hybrid CMOS/MTJ circuits design. Aiming to improve
the inference efficiency, an SBG sharing strategy is leveraged to reduce the
required SBG array scale by integrating a switch network between SBG array and
stochastic computing logic. A device-to-architecture level framework is
proposed to evaluate the performance of spintronics based Bayesian inference
system (SPINBIS). Experimental results on data fusion applications have shown
that SPINBIS could improve the energy efficiency about 12X than MTJ-based
approach with 45% design area overhead and about 26X than FPGA-based approach.

promotes significant quantitative and qualitative improvements on NUMA locality
in concurrent data structures, as well as reduced contention. We build on
previous techniques of thread-local indexing and laziness, and, at a high
level, our design consists of a partitioned skip graph, well-integrated with
thread-local sequential maps, operating without contention. As a
proof-of-concept, we implemented map and relaxed priority queue ADTs using our
technique. Maps were conceived using lazy and non-lazy approaches to insertions
and removals, and our implementations are shown to be competitive with
state-of-the-art maps. We observe a 6x higher CAS locality, a 68.6% reduction
on the number of remote CAS operations, and a increase from 88.3% to 99% CAS
success rate when using a lazy skip graph as compared to a control skip list
(subject to the same codebase, optimizations, and implementation practices).
Qualitatively speaking, remote memory accesses are not only reduced in number,
but the larger the NUMA distance between threads, the larger the reduction is.
We consider two alternative implementations of relaxed priority queues that
further take advantage of our data partitioning over skip graphs: (a) using
``spraying'', a well-known random-walk technique usually performed over skip
lists, but now performed over skip graphs; and (b) a custom protocol that
traverses the skip graph deterministically, marking elements along this
traversal. We provide formal arguments indicating that the first approach is
more \emph{relaxed}, that is, that the span of removed keys is larger, while
the second approach has smaller contention. Experimental results indicate that
the approach based on spraying performs better on skip graphs, yet both seem to
scale appropriately.

extended halo structure of $h$ and $\chi$ Persei, about 6 - 8 times larger than
their core radii. We report the discovery of filamentary substructures
extending to about 200 pc away from the Double Cluster. The tangential
velocities of these distant substructures suggest that they are more likely to
be the remnants of primordial structures, instead of a tidally disrupted stream
from the cluster cores. Moreover, the internal kinematic analysis indicates
that halo stars seems to be experiencing a dynamic stretching in the RA
direction, while the impact of the core components is relatively negligible.

implementing strategies. We formulate the problem using a voting game where two
candidate agents contest in an election with the goal of convincing population
members (other agents), that are connected to each other via an underlying
network, to vote for them. To achieve this goal, agents are only allowed to
exchange messages in the form of sequences of discrete symbols to spread their
propaganda. We use neural networks with Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for sampling
categorical random variables to parameterize the policies followed by all
agents. Using our proposed framework, we provide concrete answers to the

and does the emergent communication play a role in deciding the winner? (ii)
Does the system evolve as expected under various reward structures? (iii) How
is the emergent language affected by the community structure in the network? To

conclusions of the super-exchange theory, they reveal the antiferromagnetic
(ferromagnetic) ordering along with bond angle of 180 degrees (90 degrees) in
the cation-anion-cation interaction path, in which the theory sets a
pre-condition that the electronic states of cations in all paths are identical.
We observed that the GKA rules are in fact not universal and even invalid to
materials containing anions with different valence states, for example, the
layered CrOCl crystal (with two valence states of anions: O2- and Cl-). In this
study, we propose an extended super-exchange theory (ESET) related to
superposed electronic states of cation in a specific path. ESET is capable of
predicting not only the sign and relative magnitude of magnetic exchange
constants in different cation-anion-cation paths, but also the magnetic ground
state. Through our proposed theory, we conclude that the magnetic ordering
along with bond angle of 90 degrees in Cr-Cl-Cr path is moderately
antiferromagnetic and of 180 degrees in Cr-O-Cr path is strongly ferromagnetic,
which are opposite to the contents of GKA rules. Moreover, we clarify that
monolayer CrOCl has antiferromagnetic ordering rather than ferromagnetic as
reported recently. The reliability of ESET is verified via first-principles
calculation and previous experimental report as well, and its universality is
also demonstrated. Thus, our theory is powerful to predict the magnetic
properties, which makes it possible to design new high Curie temperature
two-dimensional semiconducting ferromagnets with polyvalent anion materials.

admissible, in this paper, we investigate the issue from two different
non-inertial observers' perspective. A detailed analysis is being done to find
the observable quantities as measured by two non-inertial observers (one is
Rindler and another is uniformly rotating) on the real thermal bath and Rindler
frame in Minkowski spacetime. More precisely, we compare Thermal-Rindler with
Rindler-Rindler and Thermal-rotating with Rindler-rotating situations. In the
first model it is observed that although some of the observables are
equivalent, all the components of renormalised stress-tensor are not the same.
In the later model, we again find that this equivalence is not totally
guaranteed. Therefore we argue that the indistinguishability between the real
thermal bath and the Rindler frame may not be totally true.

object rearrangement has shown to be NP-hard, it is difficult to perform
manipulation tasks efficiently which could frequently happen in service domains

usually suffers breakup at a critical value of the strength of gain-loss terms,
i.e., imaginary part of the complex potential. On the other hand, it is known
that the PT-symmetry can be made unbreakable in a one-dimensional (1D) model
with self-defocusing nonlinearity whose strength grows fast enough from the
center to periphery. The model is nonlinearizable, i.e., it does not have a
linear spectrum, while the (unbreakable) PT symmetry in it is defined by
spectra of continuous families of nonlinear self-trapped states (solitons).
Here we report results for a 2D nonlinearizable model whose PT symmetry remains
unbroken for arbitrarily large values of the gain-loss coeffcient. Further, we
introduce an extended 2D model with the imaginary part of potential ~ xy in the
Cartesian coordinates. The latter model is not a PT-symmetric one, but it also
supports continuous families of self-trapped states, thus suggesting an
extension of the concept of the PT symmetry. For both models, universal
analytical forms are found for nonlinearizable tails of the 2D modes, and full
exact solutions are produced for particular solitons, including ones with the
unbreakable PT symmetry, while generic soliton families are found in a
numerical form. The PT-symmetric system gives rise to generic families of
stable single- and double-peak 2D solitons (including higher-order radial
states of the single-peak solitons), as well as families of stable vortex
solitons with winding numbers m = 1, 2, and 3. In the model with imaginary
potential ~ xy, families of single-and multi-peak solitons and vortices are
stable if the imaginary potential is subject to spatial confinement. In an
elliptically deformed version of the latter model, an exact solution is found
for vortex solitons with m = 1.

neutrino interactions in a liquid scintillator detector. The technique uses
position and time of photo-electrons (PEs) to separate directional Cherenkov
light from isotropic sintillation light in the reconstruction of the kinematics
of candidate events. Here we introduce a Cherenkov-scintillation space time
boundary defined as the light cone in the 2-dimensional space of the arrival
time and the polar angle of each PE with respect to the axis from the center of
the detector to the vertex. The PEs located near the boundary correspond to
photons that were emitted early and contain a high fraction of directional
Cherenkov PEs. We apply weights derived from the distance to the boundary of
each individual PE, which are then used in a spherical harmonics analysis that
separates the two-track event topology of double-beta decay from the one-track
topology of $^8$B events. The Geant-4 simulation assumes a detector of 6.5 m
radius filled with $^{130}$Te-loaded liquid scintillator and surrounded by
photo-detectors with time and space resolutions of 100 ps and 3 mm
respectively. The scintillation properties and photo-detector quantum
efficiency are modeled after KamLAND. Assuming a fiducial volume of 3 m radius,
a photo-coverage of 65% and vertex resolution of $\sigma_{r_v} = $ 5.2 cm at
2.53 MeV the method of reconstructing event topology predicts factors of 1.3
and 2.3 in background suppression at 90% and 70% signal efficiency
respectively. Additionally, the PEs near the Cherenkov-scintillation space-time
boundary can be used to reconstruct the directionality of one-electron
candidate events, allowing for further $^8$B background suppression due to the
correlation between the direction of the scattered electron and the position of
the sun. We find polar and azimuthal angular resolutions of 0.46 and 0.84

such as biclustering when $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are Gaussians and the
planted dense subgraph formulation of community detection when the submatrix is
a principal minor and $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are Bernoulli random

a statistical-computational gap depending on $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$
between the minimum $k$ at which this task can be solved and the minimum $k$ at
which it can be solved in polynomial time. Our main result is to tightly

reductions from the planted clique conjecture. These computational lower bounds
hold given mild assumptions on $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ arising

and analyze the dynamic data, which is named optical flow in video processing.
However, unlike video, which contains abundant visual features in each frame, a
2D LiDAR map lacks distinctive local features. To alleviate this challenge, we
propose to estimate the motion flow based on deep neural networks inspired by
its powerful representation learning ability in estimating the optical flow of
the video. To this end, we design a recurrent neural network based on gated
recurrent unit, which is named LiDAR-FlowNet. As a recurrent neural network can
encode the temporal dynamic information, our LiDAR-FlowNet can estimate motion
flow between the current map and the unknown next map only from the current
frame and previous frames. A self-supervised strategy is further designed to
train the LiDAR-FlowNet model effectively, while no training data need to be
manually annotated. With the estimated motion flow, it is straightforward to
predict the 2D LiDAR map at the next moment. Experimental results verify the
effectiveness of our LiDAR-FlowNet as well as the proposed training strategy.
The results of the predicted LiDAR map also show the advantages of our motion
flow based method.

encircled $\pi$ Berry flux carried by the nodal loop result in a fascinating
interplay between the effective dimensionality of electron diffusion and band
topology, which depends on the scattering range of the impurity potential
relative to the size of the nodal loop. For a short-range impurity potential,
backscattering is dominated by the interference paths that do not encircle the
nodal loop, yielding a 3D weak localization effect. In contrast, for a
long-range impurity potential, the electrons effectively diffuse in various 2D
planes and the backscattering is dominated by the interference paths that
encircle the nodal loop. The latter, leads to weak antilocalization with a 2D
scaling law. Our results are consistent with symmetry consideration, where the
two regimes correspond to the orthogonal and symplectic classes, respectively.
Furthermore, we present weak-field magnetoconductivity calculations at low
temperatures for realistic experimental parameters, and predict that clear
scaling signatures $\propto\sqrt{B}$ and $\propto -\ln B$, respectively. The

trade-off between nonequilibrium current fluctuations and dissipation, has been
found for various Markovian systems. However, this relation has not been

uncertainty relation for time-delayed Langevin systems. We prove that the
fluctuation of arbitrary dynamical observables is constrained by the
Kullback--Leibler divergence between the distributions of the forward path and
its reversed counterpart. Specifically, for observables that are antisymmetric
under time reversal, the fluctuation is bounded from below by a function of a
quantity that can be identified as a generalization of the total entropy
production in Markovian systems. We also provide a lower bound for arbitrary
observables that are odd under position reversal. The term in this bound
reflects the extent to which the position symmetry has been broken in the
system and can be positive even in equilibrium. Our results hold for finite
observation times and a large class of time-delayed systems because detailed
underlying dynamics are not required for the derivation. We numerically verify
the derived uncertainty relations using two single time-delay systems and one

consistency of two approaches in prediction. A striking result is that the
widely-used method of imputing with a constant, such as the mean prior to
learning is consistent when missing values are not informative. This contrasts
with inferential settings where mean imputation is pointed at for distorting
the distribution of the data. That such a simple approach can be consistent is
important in practice. We also show that a predictor suited for complete
observations can predict optimally on incomplete data,through multiple
imputation.Finally, to compare imputation with learning directly with a model
that accounts for missing values, we analyze further decision trees. These can
naturally tackle empirical risk minimization with missing values, due to their
ability to handle the half-discrete nature of incomplete variables. After
comparing theoretically and empirically different missing values strategies in
trees, we recommend using the ""missing incorporated in attribute"" method as it

rendezvous on a common available channel in a cognitive radio network (CRN) has
received a lot of attention lately. Most rendezvous algorithms in the
literature focused on constructing channel hopping (CH) sequences that
guarantee finite maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR). However, these algorithms
perform rather poorly in terms of the expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR) even
when compared to the simple random algorithm. In this paper, we propose the
quasi-random (QR) CH algorithm that has a comparable ETTR to the random
algorithm and a comparable MTTR to the best bound in the literature. Our QR
algorithm does not require the unique identifier (ID) assumption and it is very
simple to implement in the symmetric, asynchronous, and heterogeneous setting
with multiple radios. In a CRN with $N$ commonly labelled channels, the MTTR of
the QR algorithm is bounded above by $9 M \lceil n_1/m_1 \rceil \cdot \lceil
n_2/m_2 \rceil$ time slots, where $n_1$ (resp. $n_2$) is the number of
available channels to user $1$ (resp. 2), $m_1$ (resp. $m_2$) is the number of
radios for user $1$ (resp. 2), and $M=\lceil \lceil \log_2 N \rceil /4 \rceil
*5+6$. Such a bound is only slightly larger than the best $O((\log \log N)
\frac{n_1 n_2}{m_1 m_2})$ bound in the literature. When each SU has a single
radio, the ETTR is bounded above by $\frac{n_1 n_2}{G}+9Mn_1n_2 \cdot
(1-\frac{G}{n_1 n_2})^M$, where $G$ is the number of common channels between
these two users. By conducting extensive simulations, we show that for both the
MTTR and the ETTR, our algorithm is comparable to the simple random algorithm

where the joint impact of the small-scale channel fading and the large-scale
path loss is examined. To be specific, two probabilistic metrics, namely, the
covert outage probability and the connectivity probability, are adopted to
characterize the covertness and reliability of the transmission, respectively,
and analytically tractable expressions for the two metrics are derived. The
worst-case covert communication scenario is then investigated, {where the
wardens invariably can maximize the covert outage probability by adjusting the
detection thresholds for their detectors}. Afterwards, the optimal transmit
power and transmission rate are jointly designed to maximize the covert
throughput subject to a covertness constraint. Interestingly, it is found that
the maximal covert throughput for both the CAS and DAS is invariant to the
density of interferers and the interfering power, regardless of the number of

DAS in terms of the covert throughput for the random network of interest, and

  The most common Gaussian process-based surrogate model assumes that the

often the target function doesn't satisfy this approximation. Here we consider

algorithms which have shown to achieve (beyond) state-of-the-art performance
for a variety of problems or lead to reduced implementation complexity.
However, most work on this topic is simulation based and implementation on
specialized hardware for fast inference, such as field-programmable gate arrays
(FPGAs), is widely ignored. In particular for practical uses, NN weights should
be quantized and inference carried out by a fixed-point instead of
floating-point system, widely used in consumer class computers and graphics
processing units (GPUs). Moving to such representations enables higher
inference rates and complexity reductions, at the cost of precision loss. We
demonstrate that it is possible to implement NN-based algorithms in fixed-point
arithmetic with quantized weights at negligible performance loss and with
hardware complexity compatible with practical systems, such as FPGAs and
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

investigating semi-classical particle motions near the hyperbolic fixed point

a Boltzmann distribution. We also argue that this emission is related to
acoustic Hawking radiation in quantum fluid. Besides, we discuss when the bound

development of social activities. At present, environmental air quality
measurement mainly adopts the method that setting air quality detector at
specific monitoring points in cities and timing sampling analysis, which is
easy to be restricted by time and space factors. Some air quality measurement
algorithms related to deep learning mostly adopt a single convolutional neural
network to train the whole image, which will ignore the difference of different
parts of the image. In this paper, we propose a method for air quality
measurement based on double-channel convolutional neural network ensemble
learning to solve the problem of feature extraction for different parts of
environmental images. Our method mainly includes two aspects: ensemble learning
of double-channel convolutional neural network and self-learning weighted
feature fusion. We constructed a double-channel convolutional neural network,
used each channel to train different parts of the environment images for
feature extraction. We propose a feature weight self-learning method, which
weights and concatenates the extracted feature vectors, and uses the fused
feature vectors to measure air quality. Our method can be applied to the two
tasks of air quality grade measurement and air quality index (AQI) measurement.
Moreover, we build an environmental image dataset of random time and location
condition. The experiments show that our method can achieve nearly 82% accuracy
and a small mean absolute error (MAE) on our test dataset. At the same time,
through comparative experiment, we proved that our proposed method gained
considerable improvement in performance compared with single channel
convolutional neural network air quality measurements.

insight into how matter and energy flow from the chromosphere into the
heliosphere. Observed variations depend on the first ionization potential (FIP)
of the main elements of the Sun's atmosphere. High-FIP elements (>10 eV)
maintain photospheric abundances in the corona, whereas low-FIP elements have
enhanced abundances. Conversely, inverse FIP (IFIP) refers to the enhancement
of high-FIP or depletion of low-FIP elements. We use spatially resolved
spectroscopic observations, specifically the Ar XIV/Ca XIV intensity ratio,
from Hinode's Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer to investigate the
distribution and evolution of plasma composition within two confined flares in
a newly emerging, highly sheared active region. During the decay phase of the
first flare, patches above the flare ribbons evolve from the FIP to the IFIP
effect, while the flaring loop tops show a stronger FIP effect. The patch and
loop compositions then evolve toward the pre-flare basal state. We propose an
explanation of how flaring in strands of highly sheared emerging magnetic
fields can lead to flare-modulated IFIP plasma composition over coalescing
umbrae which are crossed by flare ribbons. Subsurface reconnection between the
coalescing umbrae leads to the depletion of low-FIP elements as a result of an
increased wave flux from below. This material is evaporated when the flare
ribbons cross the umbrae. Our results are consistent with the ponderomotive
fractionation model (Laming2015) for the creation of IFIP-biased plasma.

encourages not only shared pattern of sparsity, but also shared values of edges

generation from magnetic constrictions limits the useful current density,
resulting in stochastic skyrmion motion, which may obscure topological
phenomena such as the skyrmion Hall effect. In order to address this issue, we
designed a nonmagnetic conducting Ti/Au point contact in devices made of

Multiway Cut. In this generalization, called the Space Cover problem, we are
given a binary matroid M with a ground set E, a set of terminals T\subseteq E,
and a non-negative integer k. The task is to decide whether T can be spanned by
a subset of E\setminus T of size at most k.
  We prove that on graphic matroid perturbations, for every fixed r, Space
Cover is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by k. On the other hand, the
problem becomes W[1]-hard when parameterized by r+k+|T| and it is NP-complete
for r\leq 2 and |T|\leq 2.
  On cographic matroids, that are the duals of graphic matroids, Space Cover
generalizes another fundamental and well-studied problem, namely Multiway Cut.
We show that on the duals of perturbed graphic matroids the Space Cover problem
is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by r+k.

population version of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the case of
\textit{truncated} mixtures of two Gaussians. Truncated samples from a
$d$-dimensional mixture of two Gaussians $\frac{1}{2} \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu},
\vec{\Sigma})+ \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{N}(-\vec{\mu}, \vec{\Sigma})$ means that a
sample is only revealed if it falls in some subset $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of
positive (Lebesgue) measure. We show that for $d=1$, EM converges almost surely
(under random initialization) to the true mean (variance $\sigma^2$ is known)
for any measurable set $S$. Moreover, for $d>1$ we show EM almost surely
converges to the true mean for any measurable set $S$ when the map of EM has
only three fixed points, namely $-\vec{\mu}, \vec{0}, \vec{\mu}$ (covariance
matrix $\vec{\Sigma}$ is known), and prove local convergence if there are more
than three fixed points. We also provide convergence rates of our findings. Our
techniques deviate from those of Daskalakis et al. 2017, which heavily depend
on symmetry that the untruncated problem exhibits. For example, for an
arbitrary measurable set $S$, it is impossible to compute a closed form of the
update rule of EM. Moreover, arbitrarily truncating the mixture, induces
further correlations among the variables. We circumvent these challenges by
using techniques from dynamical systems, probability and statistics; implicit
function theorem, stability analysis around the fixed points of the update rule
of EM and correlation inequalities (FKG).

geometry; via analysis of the non-linearity of the generator function. In new
developments, deep generative models have been used for learning semantically

Recently, unbiased risk estimation framework has achieved state-of-the-art

DEDPUL, a method that solves PU Learning without the aforementioned issues. The
mechanism behind DEDPUL is to apply a computationally cheap post-processing

or were masked by one of the eight de-identification algorithms. All masking
algorithms lowered identification accuracy substantially, relative to the
unmasked video. In all cases, identifications were made with stringent decision
criteria indicating the subjects had low confidence in their decisions. When
matching the identities in high-resolution still images to those in the masked
videos, the CNN performed at chance. Next, we examined CNN performance on the

conclude that carefully tested de-identification approaches, used alone or in

Depending on the speed of convergence of the process underlying the data, these

widely explored in the literature, a prominent example being the slow
convergence to their Gumbel limit of Gaussian maxima, which are better
approximated by a negative Weibull distribution at finite levels. In the
context of subasymptotic multivariate extremes, research has only dealt with
specific cases related to componentwise maxima and multivariate regular
variation. This paper explores the conditional extremes model (Heffernan and
Tawn, 2004) in order to shed light on its finite-sample behaviour and to reduce
the bias of extrapolations beyond the range of the available data. We identify
second-order features for different types of conditional copulas, and obtain

contracts - programs that are executed across a decentralised network of nodes.
As smart contracts become more popular and carry more value, they become more
of an interesting target for attackers. In the past few years, several smart
contracts have been exploited by attackers. However, a new trend towards a more
proactive approach seems to be on the rise, where attackers do not search for
vulnerable contracts anymore. Instead, they try to lure their victims into
traps by deploying seemingly vulnerable contracts that contain hidden traps.
This new type of contracts is commonly referred to as honeypots. In this paper,
we present the first systematic analysis of honeypot smart contracts, by
investigating their prevalence, behaviour and impact on the Ethereum

constrain them through cosmological observations. We focus on the Horndeski
scalar-tensor theory and on the quantities that can be measured with a minimum
of assumptions. Alternatives or extensions of General Relativity have been
proposed ever since its early years. Because of Lovelock theorem, modifying
gravity in four dimensions typically means adding new degrees of freedom. The
simplest way is to include a scalar field coupled to the curvature tensor
terms. The most general way of doing so without incurring in the Ostrogradski
instability is the Horndeski Lagrangian and its extensions. Testing gravity
means therefore, in its simplest term, testing the Horndeski Lagrangian. Since
local gravity experiments can always be evaded by assuming some screening
mechanism or that baryons are decoupled, or even that the effects of modified
gravity are visible only at early times, we need to test gravity with
cosmological observations in the late universe (large-scale structure) and in
the early universe (cosmic microwave background). In this work we review the
basic tools to test gravity at cosmological scales, focusing on
model-independent measurements.

minimally invaive technique for bio-medical imaging [1]. SD-OCT typically
relies on the use of superluminescent diodes (SLD), which provide a low-noise
and broadband optical spectrum. Recent advances in photonic chipscale frequency
combs [2, 3] based on soliton formation in photonic integrated microresonators
provide an chipscale alternative illumination scheme for SD-OCT. Yet to date,
the use of such soliton microcombs in OCT has not yet been analyzed. Here we
explore the use of soliton microcombs in spectral domain OCT and show that, by
using photonic chipscale Si3N4 resonators in conjunction with 1300 nm pump
lasers, spectral bandwidths exceeding those of commercial SLDs are possible. We
demonstrate that the soliton states in microresonators exhibit a noise floor
that is ca. 3 dB lower than for the SLD at identical power, but can exhibit
significantly lower noise performance for powers at the milliWatt level. We
perform SD-OCT imaging on an ex vivo fixed mouse brain tissue using the soliton
microcomb, alongside an SLD for comparison, and demonstrate the principle
viability of soliton based SD-OCT. Importantly, we demonstrate that classical
amplitude noise of all soliton comb teeth are correlated, i.e. common mode, in
contrast to SLD or incoherent microcomb states [4], which should, in theory,
improve the image quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for circular
ranging, i.e. optical sub-sampling [5, 6], due to the high coherence and
temporal periodicity of the soliton state. Taken together, our work indicates
the promising properties of soliton microcombs for SD-OCT.

to slow ramps of their internal interaction strength. We identify three
dynamical regimes as a function of ramp duration. For short ramp times, these
systems become non-superconducting; however, fermions with opposite momenta
remain paired albeit with reduced amplitudes, and the associated pair amplitude
distribution is non-thermal. In this first regime, the disappearance of
superconductivity is due to the loss of phase coherence between pairs. By
contrast, for intermediate ramp times, superconductivity survives but the
magnitude of the order parameter is reduced and presents long-lived
oscillations. Finally, for long ramp times, phase coherence is almost fully
retained during the slow interaction quench, and the steady-state is
characterized by a thermal-like pair amplitude distribution. Using this
approach, one can therefore dynamically tune the coherence between pairs in
order to control the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter and even
engineer a non-equilibrium state made of pre-formed pairs.

standardized codecs, namely H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) and High
Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Specifically, the paper outlines a joint
crypto-transcoding scheme for secure transrating of a video bitstream. That is
to say it generates new video bitrates, possibly as part of an HTTP Adaptive
Streaming (HAS) content delivery network. The scheme will reduce the bitrate to
one or more lower desired bit-rate without consuming time in the
encryption/decryption process, which would be the case when full encryption is
used. In addition, the decryption key no longer needs to be exposed at
intermediate middleboxes, including when transrating is performed in a cloud
datacenter. The effectiveness of the scheme is variously evaluated: by
examination of the SE generated visual distortion; by the extent of
computational and bitrate overheads; and by choice of cipher when encrypting
the selected elements within the bitstream. Results indicate that there
remains: a content; quantization level (after transrating of an encrypted
video); and codec-type dependency to any distortion introduced. A further
recommendation is that the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is preferred for
SE to lightweight XOR encryption, despite it being taken up elsewhere as a
real-time encryption method.

network applications, such as DoS and anomaly detection. Through programmable
languages as P4, heavy hitter detection can be implemented directly in the

processed at a network node. This enables networks to immediately respond to
changes in network traffic in the data-plane itself and allows for different
QoS profiles for heavy hitter and non-heavy hitter traffic.
  Current interval-based methods that flush the whole counting structure are
not well-suited for programmable hardware (the data-plane), because they either
require more resources than available in that hardware, they do not provide
good accuracy, or require too many actions from the control-plane. A sliding
window approach that maintains accuracy over time would solve these issues.
However, to the best of our knowledge, the concept of sliding windows in
programmable hardware has not been studied yet.

identifying heavy hitters separately and propose multiple memory- and
processing-efficient solutions for each of them. These solutions are suitable
for P4 programmable hardware and can be combined at will to solve the streaming

However, unlike for Gaussian state-space models - where filtering, predictive

models require approximations or sequential Monte Carlo strategies for
inference and prediction. This is due to the apparent absence of conjugacy
between the Gaussian states and the likelihood induced by the observation
equation for the binary data. In this article we prove that the filtering,
predictive and smoothing distributions in dynamic probit models with Gaussian
state variables are, in fact, available and belong to a class of unified
skew-normals (SUN) whose parameters can be updated recursively in time via
analytical expressions. Also the key functionals of these distributions are, in
principle, available, but their calculation requires the evaluation of
multivariate Gaussian cumulative distribution functions. Leveraging SUN
properties, we address this issue via novel Monte Carlo methods based on
independent samples from the smoothing distribution, that can easily be adapted
to the filtering and predictive case, thus improving state-of-the-art
approximate and sequential Monte Carlo inference in small-to-moderate

SUN properties are also developed to deal with online inference in high

phases of matter, which cannot be realized by static systems. In many cases,
these anomalous phases can be many-body localized, which implies that they are
stable and do not heat up as a result of the driving. What types of anomalous
topological phenomena can be stabilized in driven systems, and in particular,
can an anomalous phase exhibiting non-Abelian anyons be stabilized? We address
this question using an exactly solvable, stroboscopically driven 2D Kitaev spin
model, in which anisotropic exchange couplings are boosted at consecutive time
intervals. The model shows a rich phase diagram which contains anomalous
topological phases. We characterize these phases using weak and strong
scattering-matrix invariants defined for the fermionic degrees of freedom. Of
particular importance is an anomalous phase whose zero flux sector exhibits
fermionic bands with zero Chern numbers, while a vortex binds a pair of
Majorana modes, which as we show support non-Abelian braiding statistics. We
further show that upon adding disorder, the zero flux sector of the model
becomes localized. However, the model does not remain localized for a finite
density of vortices. Hybridization of Majorana modes bound to vortices form
""vortex bands"", which delocalize by either forming Chern bands or a thermal
metal phase. We conclude that while the model cannot be many-body localized, it
may still exhibit long thermalization times, owing to the necessity to create a
finite density of vortices for delocalization to occur.

considers the type of region and the number of supply centers adjacent to the

using methods from human-robot interaction. However, these methods often lack
an expressive feedback system, are restricted to robot's on-board interaction
capabilities and require a direct line of sight between human and robot. This
negatively affects the user experience and interaction time. Therefore, we
investigate the effect of a smart environment on the teaching of virtual
borders with the objective to enhance the perceptual and interaction
capabilities of a robot. For this purpose, we propose a novel interaction
method based on a laser pointer, that leverages a smart home environment in the
interaction process. This interaction method comprises an architecture for a
smart home environment designed to support the interaction process, the
cooperation of human, robot and smart environment in the interaction process, a
cooperative perception including stationary and mobile cameras to perceive
laser spots and an algorithm to extract virtual borders from multiple camera
observations. The results of an experimental evaluation support our hypotheses
that our novel interaction method features a significantly shorter interaction
time and a better user experience compared to an approach without support of a
smart environment. Moreover, the interaction method does not negatively affect
other user requirements concerning completeness and accuracy.

hypergraphs, and posets. It is known that hypergraph dualization amounts to
generate all minimal transversals of a hypergraph, or all minimal dominating
sets of a graph. In this new framework, a poset on vertices is given together
with the input (hyper)graph, and minimal ``ideal solutions'' are to be
generated. This in particular allows us to study the complexity of the problem
under various combined restrictions on graph classes and poset types, including
bipartite, split, and co-bipartite graphs, and variants of neighborhood
inclusion posets. We for example show that while the enumeration of minimal
dominating sets is possible with linear delay in split graphs, the problem,
within the same class, gets as hard as for general graphs when generalized to
this framework. More surprisingly, this result holds even when the poset is
only comparing vertices of included neighborhoods in the graph. If both the
poset and the graph class are sufficiently restricted, we show that the
dualization is tractable relying on existing algorithms from the literature.

towards the minimization of network energy consumption. Particularly, we model
the interactions between caching vehicles and mobile users as a 2-D Markov

Based on the developed model, we propose an online vehicular caching design by

tasks. However, it is unclear how close we are to the vision of putting Deep RL
into practice to solve real world problems. In particular, common practice in
the field is to train policies on largely deterministic simulators and to
evaluate algorithms through training performance alone, without a train/test
distinction to ensure models generalise and are not overfitted. Moreover, it is
not standard practice to check for generalisation under domain shift, although
robustness to such system change between training and testing would be
necessary for real-world Deep RL control, for example, in robotics. In this
paper we study these issues by first characterising the sources of uncertainty
that provide generalisation challenges in Deep RL. We then provide a new
benchmark and thorough empirical evaluation of generalisation challenges for
state of the art Deep RL methods. In particular, we show that, if
generalisation is the goal, then common practice of evaluating algorithms based
on their training performance leads to the wrong conclusions about algorithm
choice. Finally, we evaluate several techniques for improving generalisation
and draw conclusions about the most robust techniques to date.

We focus here on dependence measures based on reproducing kernel Hilbert

probability distributions modeling the uncertainty of inputs may be themselves
uncertain and it is important to quantify the global impact of this uncertainty
on GSA results. We call it here the second-level global sensitivity analysis
(GSA2). However, GSA2, when performed with a double Monte Carlo loop, requires
a large number of model evaluations which is intractable with CPU time
expensive simulators. To cope with this limitation, we propose a new
statistical methodology based on a single Monte Carlo loop with a limited

chosen probability distribution and the associated code outputs are computed.
From this inputs/output sample, we perform GSA for various assumed probability
distributions of inputs by using weighted HSIC measures estimators. Statistical
properties of these weighted esti-mators are demonstrated. Finally, we define 2

variational equations in the crust are solved within a Compressible Liquid Drop
(CLD) approach, with surface parameters consistently optimized for each EoS set
on experimental nuclear mass data. When EoS parameters are taken from known
Skyrme or RMF functionals, the transition point of those models is nicely
reproduced. A model-independent probability distribution of EoS parameters and
of the transition density and pressure is determined with a Bayesian analysis,
where the prior is given by an uncorrelated distribution of parameters within
the present empirical uncertainties, and constraints are applied both from
neutron star physics and ab-initio modelling. We show that the characteristics
of the transition point are largely independent of the high density properties
of the EoS, while ab-initio EoS calculations of neutron and symmetric matter
are far more constraining. The most influential parameter for the determination
of the transition point governs the surface properties of extremely neutron
rich matter, and it is strongly unconstrained. This explains the large
dispersion of existing predictions of the transition point. Only if the surface
tension is fixed to a reasonable but somewhat arbitrary value, strong
correlations with isovector parameters ($L_{sym},K_{sym}$ and $Q_{sym}$) are
recovered. Within the present experimental and theoretical uncertainties on
those parameters, we estimate the transition density as $n_t= 0.072\pm 0.011$

synthesis window (here 8 ms) required for low-latency operation, and, c) using
a buffer in the beginning of audio mixture to estimate cluster centres

speakers within the rest of the signal. The buffer duration would serve as an
initialization phase after which the system is capable of operating with 8 ms
algorithmic latency. We evaluate our proposed approach on two-speaker mixtures
from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) corpus. We observe that the use of LSTM
yields around one dB lower SDR as compared to the baseline bidirectional LSTM
in terms of source to distortion ratio (SDR). Moreover, using an 8 ms synthesis
window instead of 32 ms degrades the separation performance by around 2.1 dB as

different buffer durations noting that separation can be achieved even for

common in clinical trials, particularly in chronic conditions. In many of these
cases, patients will have to cross a predefined responder threshold in each of
the outcomes to be classed as a responder overall. One instance of this occurs
in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where the responder endpoint combines
two continuous, one ordinal and one binary measure. The overall binary
responder endpoint is typically analysed using logistic regression, resulting
in a substantial loss of information. We propose a latent variable model for
the SLE endpoint, which assumes that the discrete outcomes are manifestations
of latent continuous measures and can proceed to jointly model the components
of the composite. We perform a simulation study and find the method to offer
large efficiency gains over the standard analysis. We find that the magnitude
of the precision gains are highly dependent on which components are driving
response. Bias is introduced when joint normality assumptions are not
satisfied, which we correct for using a bootstrap procedure. The method is
applied to the Phase IIb MUSE trial in patients with moderate to severe SLE. We
show that it estimates the treatment effect 2.5 times more precisely, offering
a 60% reduction in required sample size.

recently, NEGF simulations have mostly been performed with rather simple
selfenergy approximations such as the second-order Born approximation (SOA).
While they correctly capture the qualitative trends of the relaxation towards
equilibrium, the reliability and accuracy of these NEGF simulations has
remained open, for a long time. Here we report on recent tests of NEGF
simulations for finite lattice systems against exact-diagonalization and
density-matrix-renormalization-group benchmark data. The results confirm the
high accuracy and predictive capability of NEGF simulations---provided
selfenergies are used that go beyond the SOA and adequately include strong
correlation and dynamical-screening effects. We present a selfcontained
introduction to the theory of NEGF and give an overview on recent numerical
applications to compute the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of correlated
fermions. In the second part we give a detailed introduction to selfenergies
beyond the SOA. Important examples are the third-order approximation, the
\GWAx, the \TMA and the fluctuating-exchange approximation. We give a
comprehensive summary of the explicit selfenergy expressions for a variety of
systems of practical relevance, starting from the most general expressions and
the Feynman diagrams, and including also the important cases of diagonal basis
sets, the Hubbard model and the differences occuring for bosons and fermions.
With these details, and information on the computational effort and scaling
with the basis size and propagation duration, an easy use of these
approximations in numerical applications is made possible.

mass from their circumstellar disks. They are characterized by high levels of
coronal activity as revealed by X-ray observations. This activity may affect
the disk stability and the circumstellar environment. Here we investigate if an
intense coronal activity due to flares occurring close to the accretion disk
may perturb the inner disk stability, disrupt the inner part of the disk and,
possibly, trigger accretion phenomena with rates comparable with those
observed. We model a magnetized protostar surrounded by an accretion disk
through 3D magnetohydrodinamic simulations. We explore cases characterized by a
dipole plus an octupole stellar magnetic field configuration and different
density of the disk or by different levels of flaring activity. As a result of
the simulated intense flaring activity, we observe the formation of several
loops that link the star to the disk; all these loops build up a hot extended
corona with an X-ray luminosity comparable with typical values observed in
CTTSs. The intense flaring activity close to the disk can strongly perturb the
disk stability. The flares trigger overpressure waves which travel through the
disk and modify its configuration. Accretion funnels may be triggered by the
flaring activity, thus contributing to the mass accretion rate of the star.
Accretion rates synthesized from the simulations are in a range between 10^-10
and 10^-9M_sun yr^-1 The accretion columns can be perturbed by the flares and
they can interact with each other, possibly merging together in larger streams.

use an x-ray free electron laser to create and characterize a degenerate

degeneracy acts to restrict the available electron energy states, thereby
slowing the rate of transitions to and from the continuum. We couple degeneracy
and bound electron dynamics in an existing collisional-radiative code, which
agrees well with observations. The impact of the shape of the cross section,
and hence the magnitude of the correction due to degeneracy, is also discussed.
This study shows that degeneracy in plasmas can significantly influence

vertices can be decoded solely from their labels. An important class of
distance labeling schemes is that of hub labelings, where a node $v \in G$
stores its distance to the so-called hubs $S_v \subseteq V$, chosen so that for
any $u,v \in V$ there is $w \in S_u \cap S_v$ belonging to some shortest $uv$
path. Notice that for most existing graph classes, the best distance labelling
constructions existing use at some point a hub labeling scheme at least as a
key building block. Our interest lies in hub labelings of sparse graphs, i.e.,
those with $|E(G)| = O(n)$, for which we show a lowerbound of
$\frac{n}{2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}}$ for the average size of the hubsets.
Additionally, we show a hub-labeling construction for sparse graphs of average
size $O(\frac{n}{RS(n)^{c}})$ for some $0 < c < 1$, where $RS(n)$ is the
so-called Ruzsa-Szemer{\'e}di function, linked to structure of induced
matchings in dense graphs. This implies that further improving the lower bound
on hub labeling size to $\frac{n}{2^{(\log n)^{o(1)}}}$ would require a
breakthrough in the study of lower bounds on $RS(n)$, which have resisted
substantial improvement in the last 70 years. For general distance labeling of
sparse graphs, we show a lowerbound of $\frac{1}{2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}}
SumIndex(n)$, where $SumIndex(n)$ is the communication complexity of the
Sum-Index problem over $Z_n$. Our results suggest that the best achievable
hub-label size and distance-label size in sparse graphs may be
$\Theta(\frac{n}{2^{(\log n)^c}})$ for some $0<c < 1$.

on the MBH growth history. In this paper, we investigate the spin evolution of
MBHs by assuming that each MBH experiences two-phase accretion, with an initial
phase of coherent-accretion via either the standard thin disc or
super-Eddington disc, followed by a chaotic-accretion phase composed of many
episodes with different disc orientations. If the chaotic-phase is significant
to the growth of an MBH, the MBH spin quickly reaches the maximum value because
of the initial coherent-accretion, then changes to a quasi-equilibrium state
and fluctuates around a value mainly determined by the mean ratio of the disc
to the MBH mass ($M_{\bullet}$) in the chaotic-accretion episodes, and further
declines due to late chaotic-accretion if $M_\bullet \gtrsim (1-3) \times 10^8
M_\odot$. The turning point to this decline is determined by the equality of
the disc warp radius and disc size. By matching the currently available spin
measurements with mock samples generated from the two-phase model(s) on the
spin-mass plane, we find that MBHs must experience significant
chaotic-accretion phase with many episodes and the mass accreted in each
episode is roughly 1-2 percent of M_bh or less. MBHs with $M_{\bullet}\gtrsim
10^8 M_{\odot}$ appear to have intermediate-to-high spins ($\sim 0.5-1$), while
lighter MBHs have higher spins ($\gtrsim 0.8$). The best matches also infer
that (1) the radiative efficiencies ($\eta$) of those active MBHs appear to
slightly decrease with $M_{\bullet}$; however, the correlation between $\eta$
and $M_{\bullet}$, if any, is weak; (2) the mean radiative efficiency of active
MBHs is $<\eta> \sim 0.09-0.15$, consistent with the global constraints.

used to study transitions of CH$_3$NH$_2$, CH$_2$NH, NH$_2$CHO, and the
$^{13}$C- and $^{15}$N-methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) isotopologues. Column
densities are derived for each species assuming LTE and excitation temperatures
in the range 220-340 K for CH$_3$NH$_2$, 70-110 K for the CH$_3$CN
isotopologues, and 120-215 K for NH$_2$CHO and CH$_2$NH. We report the first
detections of CH$_3$NH$_2$ towards NGC 6334I with column density ratios with
respect to CH$_3$OH of 5.9$\times$10$^{-3}$, 1.5$\times$10$^{-3}$, and
5.4$\times$10$^{-4}$ for the three hot cores MM1, MM2, and MM3, respectively.
These values are slightly lower than the values derived for Sgr B2 but higher

interstellar medium, albeit high-sensitivity observations are essential for its

and the observations towards NGC 6334I indicate a main formation pathway via
radical recombination on grain surfaces.

vibrotactile texture with our method rougher than they did without our method

different roughness for vibrational texture in response to the size of visual

weighted average algorithm, the co-integration method provides the chances of
the pulsar with significant red noises to attend the establishment of ensemble

the latest time for large scale tidal disruption events to occur at $\sim$3 Gyr

thus differs fundamentally from other pyrochlore QSL materials. We consider the
possibility of the $\pi$-flux U(1) QSL favored by frustrated transverse
exchange interactions rather than the usual quantum spin ice. It was previously
suggested that both dipolar U(1) QSL and octupolar U(1) QSL can be realized for
the generic spin model for the dipole-octupole doublets of the Ce$^{3+}$ local
moments on the pyrochlore magnets Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. We
explain and predict the experimental signatures especially the magnetic field
response of the octupolar $\pi$-flux U(1) QSL. Fundamentally, this remarkable
state is a mixture of symmetry enrichments from point group symmetry and from
translational symmetry. We discuss the relevant experiments for pyrochlore U(1)
QSLs and further provide some insights to the pyrochlore Heisenberg model.

  pp.168-173",,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Starting from a simple animal-biology example, a general, somewhat
counter-intuitive property of diffusion random walks is presented. It is shown
that for any (non-homogeneous) purely diffusing system, under any isotropic
uniform incidence, the average length of trajectories through the system (the
average length of the random walk trajecto-ries from entry point to first exit
point) is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion process and
therefore depends only on the geometry of the system. This exact invariance
property may be seen as a generalization to diffusion of the well known
mean-chord-length property [1], leading to broad physics and biology
applications. Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was
at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter. It is well
established, for diverse species, that the spontaneous displacement of insects
such as ants, on an horizontal planar surface, may be accurately mod-eled as a
constant-speed diffusion random-walk [2-4]. We assume that a circle of radius R
is drawn on the surface and we measure the average time that ants spend inside
the circle when they enter it (see Fig. 1). The last assumption is that
measurements are performed a long time after ants were dropped on the surface,
so that the memory of their initial position is lost : this is enough to ensure
that no specific direction is favored and therefore that when ants encounter
the circle, their incident directions are distributed isotropically. Simple
Monte Carlo simulations of such experiments (see Fig. 2) indicate without any
doubt that the average encounter time (time between entry into the circle and
first exit), for a fixed velocity, depends only of the circle radius. It is
independent of the characteristics of the diffusion walk : the mean free path
$\lambda$ (average distance between two scattering events, i.e. between two
direction-changes), and the single-scattering phase function p(u s , u i)
(probability density function of the scattering direction u s for an incident
direction u i). Furthermore, this average time scales as R/v, which means that
the average trajectory-length < L > scales as R. The average trajectory-length
would therefore be the same for different experiments with any insect
species-or for any type of diffusive corpuscular motion. There are two reasons
why this observation may initially sound counter-intuitive. The first reason is
that the average length of diffusion trajectories between two points is known
to scale approximately as d 2 /$\lambda$ where d is the distance between the
two points (1). For shorter mean (1)This scaling would be exact for an infinite
domain in the limit d >> $\lambda$ [5] c EDP Sciences

This enables us to study the influence of the disk properties on the formation

of primary pebble accretion. We show that large $\alpha$-values of $0.01$

appropriate to model the turbulent convection that develops in planetary
interiors. The code uses a Fourier decomposition in the azimuthal direction and
supports both a Chebyshev collocation method and a sparse Chebyshev integration
formulation in the cylindrically-radial direction. It supports several temporal
discretisation schemes encompassing multi-step time steppers as well as
diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta schemes. The code has been tested and validated
by comparing weakly-nonlinear convection with the eigenmodes from a linear
solver. The comparison of the two radial discretisation schemes has revealed
the superiority of the Chebyshev integration method over the classical
collocation approach both in terms of memory requirements and operation counts.
The good parallelisation efficiency enables the computation of large problem
sizes with $\mathcal{O}(10^4\times 10^4)$ grid points using several thousands
of ranks. This allows the computation of numerical models in the turbulent
regime of quasi-geostrophic convection characterised by large Reynolds $Re$ and
yet small Rossby numbers $Ro$. A preliminary result obtained for a strongly
supercritical numerical model with a small Ekman number of $10^{-9}$ and a
Prandtl number of unity yields $Re\simeq 10^5$ and $Ro \simeq 10^{-4}$. pizza
is hence an efficient tool to study spherical quasi-geostrophic convection in a

connected physical devices is increasing at a rapid pace. Mobile edge computing
is emerging to handle the sheer volume of produced data and reach the latency
demand of computation-intensive IoT applications. Although the advance of
mobile edge computing on service latency is studied solidly, security and
efficiency on data usage in mobile edge computing have not been clearly
identified. In this article, we examine the architecture of mobile edge
computing and explore the potentials of utilizing mobile edge computing to
enhance data analysis for IoT applications, while achieving data security and
computational efficiency. Specifically, we first introduce the overall
architecture and several promising edge-assisted IoT applications. We then
study the security, privacy and efficiency challenges in data processing for
mobile edge computing, and discuss the opportunities to enhance data security
and improve computational efficiency with the assistance of edge computing,
including secure data aggregation, secure data deduplication and secure
computational offloading. Finally, several interesting directions on
edge-empowered data analysis are presented for future research.

fundamental than the ones we know. One such arguments is new, and based on the

In this case, both matter and space are emergent. The other argument is old,
and was given by Richard Feynman as a possible explanation of why analog
systems do describe the same physics. The former argument naturally points to a
solution of the information paradox. The latter argument elevates analogs from
mere curiosities, to reliable tests of fundamental theories. Amusingly, the
names given to this fundamental level, both by Feynman and by some of the
modern quantum gravity researchers, e.g., Jacob Bekenstein, resemble each

buckling instability that weakens and thickens them and forms a boxy/peanut
structure in their central parts. This theoretical prediction has been
confirmed by identifying such morphologies in real galaxies. The nature and
origin of this instability remains however poorly understood with some studies
claiming it to be due to fire-hose instability while others relating it to
vertical instability of stellar orbits supporting the bar. One of the channels
for the formation of galactic bars is via the interaction of disky galaxies
with perturbers of significant mass. Tidally induced bars offer a unique
possibility of studying buckling instability because their formation can be
controlled by changing the strength of the interaction while keeping the
initial structure of the galaxy the same. We use a set of four simulations of
flyby interactions where a galaxy on a prograde orbit forms a bar, which is
stronger for stronger tidal forces. We study their buckling by calculating
different kinematic signatures, including profiles of the mean velocity in
vertical direction, as well as distortions of the bars out of the disk plane.
Although our two strongest bars buckle most strongly, there is no direct
relation between the ratio of vertical to horizontal velocity dispersion and
the bar's susceptibility to buckling, as required by the fire-hose instability
interpretation. While our weakest bar buckles, a stronger one does not, its
dispersion ratio remains low and it grows to become the strongest of all at the
end of evolution. Instead, we find that during buckling the resonance between
the vertical and radial orbital frequencies becomes wide and therefore able to
modify stellar orbits over a significant range of radii. We conclude that the
vertical orbital instability is the more plausible explanation for the origin
of buckling.

Visual and semantic feature spaces have different structures by definition. For
certain concepts, visual features might be richer and more discriminative than
text ones. While for others, the inverse might be true. Moreover, when the
support from visual information is limited in image classification, semantic
representations (learned from unsupervised text corpora) can provide strong
prior knowledge and context to help learning. Based on these two intuitions, we
propose a mechanism that can adaptively combine information from both
modalities according to new image categories to be learned. Through a series of
experiments, we show that by this adaptive combination of the two modalities,
our model outperforms current uni-modality few-shot learning methods and
modality-alignment methods by a large margin on all benchmarks and few-shot

problem in exploratory data mining. Whether the goal is to select the most
informative result for analysis, or to decide which mining approach will most
likely provide the most novel insight, it is essential that we can tell how
different the information is that different results by possibly different
methods provide.
  In this paper we take a first step towards comparing exploratory data mining
results on binary data. We propose to meaningfully convert results into sets of
noisy tiles, and compare between these sets by Maximum Entropy modelling and
Kullback-Leibler divergence, well-founded notions from Information Theory. We
so construct a measure that is highly flexible, and allows us to naturally
include background knowledge, such that differences in results can be measured
from the perspective of what a user already knows. Furthermore, adding to its
interpretability, it coincides with Jaccard dissimilarity when we only consider
exact tiles.
  Our approach provides a means to study and tell differences between results
of different exploratory data mining methods. As an application, we show that
our measure can also be used to identify which parts of results best redescribe
other results. Furthermore, we study its use for iterative data mining, where
one iteratively wants to find that result that will provide maximal novel
information. Experimental evaluation shows our measure gives meaningful
results, correctly identifies methods that are similar in nature, automatically
provides sound redescriptions of results, and is highly applicable for
iterative data mining.

with massless Majorana spinors, $u_M$, together with the associated

derived momentum independent projector, ${\mathcal P}^{(3/2,0)}$, properly
constructed from one of the Casimir operators of the algebra $so(1,3)$ of the

  Systems","Accepted by NeurIPS 2019",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale industrial recommender systems are usually confronted with
computational problems due to the enormous corpus size. To retrieve and
recommend the most relevant items to users under response time limits,
resorting to an efficient index structure is an effective and practical
solution. The previous work Tree-based Deep Model (TDM) \cite{zhu2018learning}
greatly improves recommendation accuracy using tree index. By indexing items in
a tree hierarchy and training a user-node preference prediction model
satisfying a max-heap like property in the tree, TDM provides logarithmic
computational complexity w.r.t. the corpus size, enabling the use of arbitrary
advanced models in candidate retrieval and recommendation.
  In tree-based recommendation methods, the quality of both the tree index and
the user-node preference prediction model determines the recommendation
accuracy for the most part. We argue that the learning of tree index and
preference model has interdependence. Our purpose, in this paper, is to develop
a method to jointly learn the index structure and user preference prediction
model. In our proposed joint optimization framework, the learning of index and
user preference prediction model are carried out under a unified performance
measure. Besides, we come up with a novel hierarchical user preference
representation utilizing the tree index hierarchy. Experimental evaluations
with two large-scale real-world datasets show that the proposed method improves
recommendation accuracy significantly. Online A/B test results at a display
advertising platform also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
in production environments.

soft X-ray background showed a slight variation in half a day and then a clear
one in a few hours. The former spectrum was composed of oxygen emission lines,
while the later one was characterized by a series of emission lines from highly
ionized carbon to silicon. The soft X-ray enhancement originated from
geocoronal solar wind charge exchange. However, there appeared to be no
significant time correlation with the solar wind proton flux measured by the
ACE and WIND satellites. From other solar wind signatures, we considered that
an interplanetary shock associated with the coronal mass ejection and a
turbulent sheath immediately behind the shock compressed the ambient solar wind
ions and then resulted in the soft X-ray enhancement. Furthermore, the enriched
emission lines were presumed to be due to an unusual set of ion abundances and
ionization states within the coronal mass ejection. We found a better time
correlation with the solar wind alpha flux rather than the solar wind proton
flux. Our results suggest that the solar wind proton flux is not always a good
indicator of geocoronal solar wind charge exchange, especially associated with
coronal mass ejections. Instead, the solar wind alpha flux should be
investigated when such a soft X-ray enhancement is detected in astronomical

clusters. It has been proposed that this abundance drop may be due, at least
partially, to the depletion of Fe into dust grains in the central, high-density
regions. According to this scenario, noble gas elements such as Ar and Ne are
not expected to be depleted into dust, and therefore should not show any drop,
but follow the general increase of metal abundance toward the center. In this
work, we test this scenario by measuring with {\sl Chandra} data the radial
profiles of Ar and Ne in a sample of 12 groups and clusters where a central
drop in Fe abundance has been detected. We confirm the presence of the Fe drop
in 10 out of 12 clusters at more than 2$\sigma$ c.l., and 4 Ar drops with
similar significance. We also find 4 Ne drops, with the caveat that Ne
abundance measurement from CCD spectra suffers from systematics not completely
under control. Our results are consistent with an abundance drop common to the
three elements. When comparing the profiles, we find that, on average, the
abundance profiles of Ar and Ne are significantly higher than Fe and steeper
toward the center, while they all gradually become consistent with solar
composition at $r\geq 0.05r_{500}$. We also check that Si and S profiles are
mostly consistent with Fe. This result confirms a scenario in which some
fraction of Fe is depleted into dust grains in the inner regions, although the
global central abundance drop is mostly due to mechanical processes, like the
displacement of metal-rich ICM from the very center to larger radii by
AGN-driven feedback. Finally, we report the detection of an Fe drop in the
cluster MACSJ1423.8+2404 at $z=0.543$, showing that this feature appears early
on in cool-core clusters.

two-layered domain, while the last one compares the numerical prediction
against experimental data for validation purposes. Results show how the

discrete fracture network (DFN) simulations that take advantage of the
intrinsic multi-level nature of a DFN. DFN models are used to simulate flow and
transport through low-permeability fractured media in the subsurface by
explicitly representing fractures as discrete entities. The governing equations
for flow and transport are numerically integrated on computational meshes
generated on the interconnected fracture networks. Modern high-fidelity DFN
simulations require high-performance computing on multiple processors where
performance and scalability depend partially on obtaining a high-quality
partition of the mesh to balance work-loads and minimize communication across
all processors. The discrete structure of a DFN naturally lends itself to
various graph representations. We develop two applications of the multilevel
graph partitioning algorithm to partition the mesh of a DFN. In the first, we
project a partition of the graph based on the DFN topology onto the mesh of the
DFN and in the second, this projection is used as the initial condition for
further partitioning refinement of the mesh. We compare the performance of
these methods with standard multi-level graph partitioning using graph-based
metrics (cut, imbalance, partitioning time), computational-based metrics
(FLOPS, iterations, solver time), and total run time. The DFN-based and the
mesh-based partitioning methods are comparable in terms of the graph-based
metrics, but the time required to obtain the partition is several orders of
magnitude faster using the DFN-based partitions. In combination, these
partitions are several orders of magnitude faster than the mesh-based
partition. In turn, this hybrid method outperformed both of the other methods
in terms of the total run time.

Riemann method to solve an hyperbolic equation in two variables is showed. The
second chapter is about the fundamental solution and its relation to Riemann
kernel. Therefore, the study of the fundamental solutions proceeds by showing
how to build them and by providing some examples of solution with odd and even
number of variables. In chapter four, by following Foures-Bruhat, the problem
of finding a solution to the Cauchy problem for Einstein field equations in
vacuum with non analytic initial data is presented by studying under which
assumptions second-order systems of partial differential equations, linear and
hyperbolic, with n functions and four variables admit a solution. Thus, in
chapter five, it is showed how to turn non-linear systems of partial
differential equations into linear systems of the same type for which the
previous results hold. Eventually, in chapter six, the existence and uniqueness
of the solution to the Cauchy problem for Einstein vacuum field equations is
proved. Another part of this work consists in the study of the causal structure
of space-time. The definitions of strong causality, stable causality and global
hyperbolicity are given and the relation between the property of global
hyperbolicity and the existence of Cauchy surfaces is stressed. The last
chapter concerns the study of gravitational radiation in axisymmetric black
hole collisions at the speed of light as an useful application of Riemann
kernel method to solve a second-order hyperbolic equation in two variables.

  NB-IoT",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a new Low Power Wide Area Network
(LPWAN) technology released by 3GPP. The primary goals of NB-IoT are improved
coverage, massive capacity, low cost, and long battery life. In order to
improve coverage, NB-IoT has promising solutions, such as increasing
transmission repetitions, decreasing bandwidth, and adapting the Modulation and
Coding Scheme (MCS). In this paper, we present an implementation of coverage
enhancement features of NB-IoT in NS-3, an end-to-end network simulator. The
resource allocation and link adaptation in NS-3 are modified to comply with the
new features of NB-IoT. Using the developed simulation framework, the influence
of the new features on network reliability and latency is evaluated.
Furthermore, an optimal hybrid link adaptation strategy based on all three
features is proposed. To achieve this, we formulate an optimization problem
that has an objective function based on latency, and constraint based on the
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Then, we propose several algorithms to minimize
latency and compare them with respect to accuracy and speed. The best hybrid
solution is chosen and implemented in the NS-3 simulator by which the latency
formulation is verified. The numerical results show that the proposed
optimization algorithm for hybrid link adaptation is eight times faster than
the exhaustive search approach and yields similar latency.

diffusion processes applied to the heat and moisture transfer through porous
building materials. Traditionally, by using the finite-difference approach, the
discretization follows the Method Of Lines (MOL), when the problem is first
discretized in space to obtain a large system of coupled Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs). Thus, this paper proposes to change this viewpoint. First, we
discretize in time to obtain a small system of coupled ODEs, which means
instead of having a Cauchy (Initial Value) Problem (IVP), we have a Boundary
Value Problem (BVP). Fortunately, BVPs can be solved efficiently today using
adaptive collocation methods of high order. To demonstrate the benefits of this
new approach, three case studies are presented, in which one of them is
compared with experimental data. The first one considers nonlinear heat and
moisture transfer through one material layer while the second one considers two
material layers. Results show how the nonlinearities and the interface between
materials are easily treated, by reasonably using a fourth-order adaptive
method. Finally, the last case study compares numerical results with
experimental measurements, showing a good agreement.

For the first model, the quantum advantages disappear when it comes to the

that the quantum embeddings can be trained efficiently meanwhile preserving the
quantum advantages. We show the proposed methods can achieve comparable results

quasi-reversibility numerical method is proposed for an arbitrary time interval

  Internet Paywalls",,,,,"cs.CY cs.CR cs.DL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Funding the production of quality online content is a pressing problem for
content producers. The most common funding method, online advertising, is rife
with well-known performance and privacy harms, and an intractable subject-agent
conflict: many users do not want to see advertisements, depriving the site of
needed funding.
  Because of these negative aspects of advertisement-based funding, paywalls
are an increasingly popular alternative for websites. This shift to a
""pay-for-access"" web is one that has potentially huge implications for the web
and society. Instead of a system where information (nominally) flows freely,
paywalls create a web where high quality information is available to fewer and
fewer people, leaving the rest of the web users with less information, that
might be also less accurate and of lower quality. Despite the potential
significance of a move from an ""advertising-but-open"" web to a ""paywalled"" web,
we find this issue understudied.
  This work addresses this gap in our understanding by measuring how widely
paywalls have been adopted, what kinds of sites use paywalls, and the
distribution of policies enforced by paywalls. A partial list of our findings
include that (i) paywall use is accelerating (2x more paywalls every 6 months),
(ii) paywall adoption differs by country (e.g. 18.75% in US, 12.69% in
Australia), (iii) paywalls change how users interact with sites (e.g. higher
bounce rates, less incoming links), (iv) the median cost of an annual paywall
access is $108 per site, and (v) paywalls are in general trivial to circumvent.
  Finally, we present the design of a novel, automated system for detecting
whether a site uses a paywall, through the combination of runtime browser
instrumentation and repeated programmatic interactions with the site. We intend
this classifier to augment future, longitudinal measurements of paywall use and
behavior.

phenomenal intuitions, one reductive and one strongly non-reductive, and
identifies two germane ideas that could benefit many other theories of
consciousness. Firstly, the ability of sophisticated agent architectures with a
purely physical implementation to support certain functional forms of qualia or
proto-qualia appears to entail the possibility of machine consciousness with
qualia, not only for reductive theories but also for the nonreductive ones that
regard consciousness as ubiquitous in Nature. Secondly, analysis of
introspective psychological material seems to hint that, under the threshold of
our ordinary waking awareness, there exist further 'submerged' or 'subliminal'
layers of consciousness which constitute a hidden foundation and support and
another source of our phenomenal intuitions. These 'submerged' layers might
help explain certain puzzling phenomena concerning subliminal perception, such
as the apparently 'unconscious' multisensory integration and learning of
subliminal stimuli.

applications. Among them, deep learning systems are one of the most important
consumer systems for GPU nowadays. As deep learning applications impose deeper
and larger models in order to achieve higher accuracy, memory management
becomes an important research topic for deep learning systems, given that GPU
has limited memory size. Many approaches have been proposed towards this issue,
e.g., model compression and memory swapping. However, they either degrade the
model accuracy or require a lot of manual intervention. In this paper, we
propose two orthogonal approaches to reduce the memory cost from the system
perspective. Our approaches are transparent to the models, and thus do not
affect the model accuracy. They are achieved by exploiting the iterative nature
of the training algorithm of deep learning to derive the lifetime and
read/write order of all variables. With the lifetime semantics, we are able to
implement a memory pool with minimal fragments. However, the optimization
problem is NP-complete. We propose a heuristic algorithm that reduces up to
13.3% of memory compared with Nvidia's default memory pool with equal time
complexity. With the read/write semantics, the variables that are not in use
can be swapped out from GPU to CPU to reduce the memory footprint. We propose
multiple swapping strategies to automatically decide which variable to swap and
when to swap out (in), which reduces the memory cost by up to 34.2% without
communication overhead.
