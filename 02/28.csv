objective functions, are advantageous to systems in which unexpected situations
may arise. However, synthesising such controllers, even for a single objective,
is a demanding process. In this paper, we present a novel and straightforward
approach to synthesising these policies through a combination of trajectory
optimisation, homotopy continuation, and imitation learning. We use numerical
continuation to efficiently generate optimal demonstrations across several
objectives and boundary conditions, and use these to train our policies.
Additionally, we demonstrate the ability of our policies to effectively learn
families of optimal state-feedback controllers, which can be used to change
objective functions online. We illustrate this approach across two trajectory
optimisation problems, an inverted pendulum swingup and a spacecraft orbit
transfer, and show that the synthesised policies, when evaluated in simulation,
produce trajectories that are near-optimal. These results indicate the benefit
of trajectory optimisation and homotopy continuation to the synthesis of
controllers in dynamic-objective contexts.

physical human-robot interaction as it provides considerable advantages over
traditional stiff actuators in terms of stability robustness and fidelity of
force control. Several impedance control architectures have been proposed for
SEA. Among these alternatives, the cascaded controller with an inner-most
velocity loop, an intermediate torque loop and an outer-most impedance loop is
particularly favoured for its simplicity, robustness, and performance. In this
paper, we derive the \emph{necessary and sufficient conditions} to ensure the
passivity of this cascade-controller architecture for rendering two most common
virtual impedance models. Based on the newly established passivity conditions,
we provide non-conservative design guidelines to haptically display a null
impedance and a pure spring while ensuring the passivity of interaction. We
also demonstrate the importance of including physical damping in the actuator
model during derivation of passivity conditions, when integral controllers are
utilized. In particular, we show the adversary effect of physical damping on
system passivity.

helically twisted (sigmoidal) geometries, which are consistent with dipolar
potential field models in the former case, and with nonlinear force-free field
models with vertical currents in the latter case. Alternatively, Parker-type
nanoflare models of the solar corona hypothesize that a braiding mechanism
operates between unresolved loop strands, which is a more complex topological
model. In this study we use the vertical-current approximation of a
nonpotential magnetic field solution (that fulfills the divergence-free and
force-free conditions) to characterize the number of helical turns $N_{twist}$
in twisted coronal loops. We measure the helical twist in 15 active regions
observed with AIA and HMI/SDO and find a mean nonpotentiality angle (between
the potential and nonpotential field directions) of $\mu_{NP} = 15^\circ \pm
3^\circ$. The resulting mean rotational twist angle is $\varphi = 49^\circ \pm
11^\circ$, which corresponds to $N_{twist}=\varphi/360^\circ = 0.14\pm0.03$
turns with respect to the untwisted potential field, with an absolute upper
limit of $N_{twist} \lapprox 0.5$, which is far below the kink instability
limit of $|N_{twist}| \gapprox 1$. The number of twist turns $N_{twist}$
corresponds to the Gauss linkage number $N_{link}$ in braiding topologies. We
conclude that any braided topology (with $|N_{link}| \ge 1$) cannot explain the
observed stability of loops in a force-free corona, nor the observed low twist
number. Parker-type nanoflaring can thus occur in non-forcefree environments
only, such as in the chromosphere and transition region.

excitations, in particular in conducting and superconducting systems. Here, an
empirical phenomenology based on all available literature data for planar Cu in
hole-doped cuprates is developed. It is found that most of the seemingly
different relaxation rates among the systems are due to a temperature
independent anisotropy that affects the mostly measured $1/T_{1\parallel}$, the
rate with an external magnetic field along the crystal $c$-axis, while
$1/T_{1\perp}$ is largely independent on doping and material above the critical
temperature of superconductivity ($T_c$). This includes very strongly overdoped
systems that show Fermi liquid behavior and obey the Korringa law. Below $T_c$
the relaxation rates are similar, as well, if plotted against the reduced
temperature $T/T_c$. Thus, planar Cu nuclear relaxation is governed by a
simple, dominant mechanism that couples the nuclei with varying anisotropy to a
rather ubiquitous bath of electronic excitations that appear Fermi liquid-like
irrespective of doping and family. In particular, there is no significant
enhancement of the relaxation due to electronic spin fluctuations, different
from earlier conclusions. Only the La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ family appears to be
an outlier as additional relaxation is present, however, the anisotropy remains
temperature independent. Also systems with very low doping levels, for which

test whether deep learning techniques can be used to reproduce visual
classification of observations, physical classification of simulations and
highlight any differences between these two classifications. With one of the
main difficulties of merger studies being the lack of a truth sample, we can
use our method to test biases in visually identified merger catalogues. A
convolutional neural network architecture was developed and trained in two
ways: one with observations from SDSS and one with simulated galaxies from
EAGLE, processed to mimic the SDSS observations. The SDSS images were also
classified by the simulation trained network and the EAGLE images classified by
the observation trained network. The observationally trained network achieves
an accuracy of 91.5% while the simulation trained network achieves 65.2% on the
visually classified SDSS and physically classified EAGLE images respectively.
Classifying the SDSS images with the simulation trained network was less
successful, only achieving an accuracy of 64.6%, while classifying the EAGLE
images with the observation network was very poor, achieving an accuracy of
only 53.0% with preferential assignment to the non-merger classification. This
suggests that most of the simulated mergers do not have conspicuous merger
features and visually identified merger catalogues from observations are
incomplete and biased towards certain merger types. The networks trained and
tested with the same data perform the best, with observations performing better
than simulations, a result of the observational sample being biased towards
conspicuous mergers. Classifying SDSS observations with the simulation trained
network has proven to work, providing tantalizing prospects for using
simulation trained networks for galaxy identification in large surveys.

primitive, and the fastest known algorithm for computing the DFT is the FFT
(Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm. One remarkable feature of FFT is the fact
that its runtime depends only on the size $N$ of the input vector, but not on
the dimensionality of the input domain: FFT runs in time $O(N\log N)$
irrespective of whether the DFT in question is on $\mathbb{Z}_N$ or
$\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ for some $d>1$, where $N=n^d$.
  The state of the art for Sparse FFT, i.e. the problem of computing the DFT of
a signal that has at most $k$ nonzeros in Fourier domain, is very different:
all current techniques for sublinear time computation of Sparse FFT incur an
exponential dependence on the dimension $d$ in the runtime. In this paper we
give the first algorithm that computes the DFT of a $k$-sparse signal in time
$\text{poly}(k, \log N)$ in any dimension $d$, avoiding the curse of
dimensionality inherent in all previously known techniques. Our main tool is a
new class of filters that we refer to as adaptive aliasing filters: these
filters allow isolating frequencies of a $k$-Fourier sparse signal using $O(k)$
samples in time domain and $O(k\log N)$ runtime per frequency, in any dimension
$d$.
  We also investigate natural average case models of the input signal: (1)
worst case support in Fourier domain with randomized coefficients and (2)
random locations in Fourier domain with worst case coefficients. Our techniques
lead to an $\widetilde O(k^2)$ time algorithm for the former and an $\widetilde

results from Rosetta and before. We establish a simple classification as a
common framework for inter-comparison. This classification is based on a dust
particle's structure, porosity, and strength as well as its size. Depending on
the instrumentation, these are not direct measurement parameters but we chose
them as they were the most reliable to derive our model. The proposed
classification already proved helpful in the Rosetta dust community and we
propose to take it into consideration also beyond. In this manner we hope to
better identify synergies between different instruments and methods in the

its radial velocity over the period of the APOGEE-2 observations, and the most

current expansion rate $H_0$ using Planck data and direct, model-independent
measurements in the local universe from the SH0ES collaboration disagree at
$>3.5\sigma$. Moreover, there exists a milder $\sim 2\sigma$ tension between
similar predictions for the amplitude $S_8$ of matter fluctuations and its
measurement in the local universe. As explanations relying on unresolved
systematics have not been found, theorists have been exploring explanations for
these anomalies that modify the cosmological model, altering
early-universe-based predictions for these parameters. However, new
cosmological models that attempt to resolve one tension often worsen the other.
In this paper, we investigate a decaying dark matter (DDM) model as a solution
to both tensions simultaneously. Here, a fraction of dark matter density decays
into dark radiation. The decay rate $\Gamma$ is proportional to the Hubble rate
$H$ through the constant $\alpha_{\rm dr}$, the only additional parameter of
this model. Then, this model deviates most from $\Lambda$CDM in the early
universe, with $\alpha_{\rm dr}$ being positively correlated with $H_0$ and
negatively with $S_8$. Hence, increasing $\alpha_{\rm dr}$ (and allowing dark
matter to decay in this way) can then diminish both tensions simultaneously.
When only considering Planck CMB data and the local SH0ES prior on $H_0$, $\sim
1$\% dark matter decays, decreasing the $S_8$ tension to $0.3\sigma$ and
increasing the best-fit $H_0$ by $1.6$ km/s/Mpc. However, the addition of
intermediate-redshift data (the JLA supernova dataset and baryon acoustic
oscillation data) weakens the effectiveness of this model. Only $\sim 0.5$\% of
the dark matter decays bringing the $S_8$ tension back up to $\sim 1.5 \sigma$
and the increase in the best-fit $H_0$ down to $0.4$ km/s/Mpc.

account for an additional phase shift induced by the error of the reconstructed

  Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'2019)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently,there has been a lot of interest in building compact models for
video classification which have a small memory footprint (<1 GB). While these
models are compact, they typically operate by repeated application of a small
weight matrix to all the frames in a video. E.g. recurrent neural network based
methods compute a hidden state for every frame of the video using a recurrent
weight matrix. Similarly, cluster-and-aggregate based methods such as NetVLAD,
have a learnable clustering matrix which is used to assign soft-clusters to
every frame in the video. Since these models look at every frame in the video,
the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) is still large even though the
memory footprint is small. We focus on building compute-efficient video
classification models which process fewer frames and hence have less number of
FLOPs. Similar to memory efficient models, we use the idea of distillation
albeit in a different setting. Specifically, in our case, a compute-heavy
teacher which looks at all the frames in the video is used to train a
compute-efficient student which looks at only a small fraction of frames in the
video. This is in contrast to a typical memory efficient Teacher-Student
setting, wherein both the teacher and the student look at all the frames in the
video but the student has fewer parameters. Our work thus complements the
research on memory efficient video classification. We do an extensive

reduction in high-dimensional function approximation with small data. This work
is motivated by a variety of design tasks in real-world engineering
applications, where practitioners would replace their computationally intensive
physical models (e.g., high-resolution fluid simulators) with fast-to-evaluate
predictive machine learning models, so as to accelerate the engineering design
processes. There are two major challenges in constructing such predictive
models: (a) high-dimensional inputs (e.g., many independent design parameters)
and (b) small training data, generated by running extremely time-consuming
simulations. Thus, reducing the input dimension is critical to alleviate the
over-fitting issue caused by data insufficiency. Existing methods, including
sliced inverse regression and active subspace approaches, reduce the input
dimension by learning a linear coordinate transformation; our main contribution
is to extend the transformation approach to a nonlinear regime. Specifically,
we exploit reversible networks (RevNets) to learn nonlinear level sets of a
high-dimensional function and parameterize its level sets in low-dimensional
spaces. A new loss function was designed to utilize samples of the target
functions' gradient to encourage the transformed function to be sensitive to
only a few transformed coordinates. The NLL approach is demonstrated by
applying it to three 2D functions and two 20D functions for showing the
improved approximation accuracy with the use of nonlinear transformation, as

This article presents a third, independent approach to solving parity games in

variant of a parity game. The analysis of register games leads to a
quasi-polynomial algorithm for parity games, a polynomial algorithm for
restricted classes of parity games and a novel measure of complexity, the
register index, which aims to capture the combined complexity of the priority

  We further present a translation of alternating parity word automata into
alternating weak automata with only a quasi-polynomial increase in size, based
on register games; this improves on the previous exponential translation.
  We also use register games to investigate the parity index hierarchy: while
for words the index hierarchy of alternating parity automata collapses to the
weak level, and for trees it is strict, for structures between trees and words,
it collapses logarithmically, in the sense that any parity tree automaton of
size n is equivalent, on these particular classes of structures, to an

demonstrated the ability to provide rapid approximate solutions to
high-fidelity full-order models (FOMs). However, there is no a priori assurance
that these approximate solutions are accurate; their accuracy depends on the
ability of the low-dimensional trial basis to represent the FOM solution. As a
result, ROMs can generate inaccurate approximate solutions, e.g., when the FOM
solution at the online prediction point is not well represented by training
data used to construct the trial basis. To address this fundamental deficiency
of standard model-reduction approaches, this work proposes a novel
online-adaptive mechanism for efficiently enriching the trial basis in a manner
that ensures convergence of the ROM to the FOM, yet does not incur any FOM
solves. The mechanism is based on the previously proposed adaptive
$h$-refinement method for ROMs [12], but improves upon this work in two crucial
ways. First, the proposed method enables basis refinement with respect to any
orthogonal basis (not just the Kronecker basis), thereby generalizing the
refinement mechanism and enabling it to be tailored to the physics
characterizing the problem at hand. Second, the proposed method provides a fast
online algorithm for periodically compressing the enriched basis via an
efficient proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method, which does not incur
any operations that scale with the FOM dimension. These two features allow the
proposed method to serve as (1) a failsafe mechanism for ROMs, as the method
enables the ROM to satisfy any prescribed error tolerance online (even in the
case of inadequate training), and (2) an efficient online basis-adaptation
mechanism, as the combination of basis enrichment and compression enables the
basis to adapt online while controlling its dimension.

constraints, individuals may need to use direct physical proximity to
facilitate information exchange. However, in certain task-related scenarios,
this requirement might conflict with the need for robots to spread out in the
environment, e.g., for distributed sensing or surveillance applications. This
paper demonstrates how a swarm of minimally-equipped robots can form
high-density robot aggregates which coexist with lower robot densities in the
domain. We envision a scenario where a swarm of vibration-driven robots---which
sit atop bristles and achieve directed motion by vibrating them---move somewhat
randomly in an environment while colliding with each other. Theoretical
techniques from the study of far-from-equilibrium collectives and statistical
mechanics clarify the mechanisms underlying the formation of these high and low
density regions. Specifically, we capitalize on a transformation that connects
the collective properties of a system of self-propelled particles with that of
a well-studied molecular fluid system, thereby inheriting the rich theory of
equilibrium thermodynamics. This connection is a formal one and is a relatively
recent result in studies of motility induced phase separation; it is previously
unexplored in the context of robotics. Real robot experiments as well as
simulations illustrate how inter-robot collisions can precipitate the formation
of non-uniform robot densities in a closed and bounded region.

can greatly improve predictive power when physical resources or computation
time is limited. In this paper, we draw on recent theoretical results on the
estimation of local function complexity (LFC), derived from the domain of local
polynomial smoothing (LPS), to establish a notion of local structural
complexity, which is used to develop a model-agnostic active learning
framework. Due to its reliance on pointwise estimates, the LPS model class is
not robust and scalable with respect to large input space dimensions that
typically come along with real-world problems. Here, we propose a GPR-based
estimate of LFC, which is able to manage the curse of dimensionality. To this
end, we train a mixture of experts (MoE) model where the experts are GPR models
at different bandwidths. Being the key ingredient in the calculation of LFC, we
then estimate locally optimal kernel bandwidths as the weighted average of
these bandwidth candidates, where the weights are taken from the learned gate
of the MoE model. We assess the effectiveness of our LFC estimate in an active
learning application on a prototypical low-dimensional synthetic dataset,
before taking on the challenging real-world task of reconstructing a quantum
chemical force field for a small organic molecule and demonstrating

between fleet vehicles and customer trip requests within a federated
optimization architecture. The resulting algorithm is up to four times faster
than the state-of-the-art, even if it is implemented on a less dedicated
hardware, and achieves similar service quality. Current literature showcases
the ability of state-of-the-art ridesharing algorithms to tackle very large
fleets and customer requests in almost near real-time, but the benefits of
ridesharing seem limited to centralized systems. Our algorithm suggests that
this does not need to be the case. The algorithm that we propose is fully
distributable among multiple ridesharing companies. By leveraging two datasets,
the New York city taxi dataset and the Melbourne Metropolitan Area dataset, we
show that with our algorithm, real-time ridesharing offers clear benefits with
respect to more traditional taxi fleets in terms of level of service, even if
one considers partial adoption of the system. In fact, e.g., the quality of the
solutions obtained in the state-of-the-art works that tackle the whole customer
set of the New York city taxi dataset is achieved, even if one considers only a
proportion of the fleet size and customer requests. This could make real-time
urban-scale ridesharing very attractive to small enterprises and city
authorities alike. However, in some cases, e.g., in multi-company scenarios
where companies have predefined market shares, we show that the number of
vehicles needed to achieve a comparable performance to the monopolistic setting
increases, and this raises concerns on the possible negative effects of
multi-company ridesharing.

representation. In traditional approaches, increasing this accuracy requires
increasing the number of qubits and an appropriate increase in circuit depth as
well. Here we introduce a technique requiring no additional qubits or circuit
depth that is able to remove much of this approximation in favor of additional
measurements. The technique is constructed and analyzed theoretically, and some
numerical proof of concept calculations are shown. As an example, we show how
to achieve the accuracy of a 20 qubit representation using only 4 qubits and a
modest number of additional measurements for a simple hydrogen molecule. We
close with an outlook on the impact this technique may have on both near-term
and fault-tolerant quantum simulations.

a simple, yet effective method for linking software vulnerabilities reported in

centers of galaxies that have been studied as a possible origin for the
absorbing gas around a central active galactic nucleus. NSDs may be most
relevant at $z\sim 1$ when obscured accretion onto supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) is common. This paper describes the characteristics of the stellar
remnants of NSDs at $z=0.01$, taking into account the evolution from $z=1$.
Using a stellar synthesis model, the colours, masses, and luminosities of the
stellar remnants are computed for a suite of 192 two-dimensional NSD models.
These properties are compared to observations of local nuclear star clusters
(NSCs), and a good match is found between the predicted and observed
properties. Dynamical effects will likely cause the final remnant to be a
rotating, nearly spherical distribution. In addition, $\approx 20$% of the NSD
remnants have half-light radii <~ 10 pc, consistent with NSCs hosted in both
late-type and early-type galaxies, and all the remnants follow similar
size-luminosity relationships as observed in nearby NSCs. NSDs require the
presence of a central SMBH and the most massive and compact stellar remnants
are associated with the most massive SMBHs, although stellar clusters with a
variety of sizes can be produced by all considered SMBH masses. Overall, NSDs
at $z\sim 1$ appear to be a promising origin for the $\gg 1$ Gyr NSC population

obstructions by tracing how they (partially) subside in passing to an

undertake a recovery of the characteristic features of non-relativistic quantum
mechanics beyond simply the Schr\""odinger equation. We find that once this is

A major focus is on the lingering discrepancy between two different
localization schemes in quantum field theory. The non-relativistic
approximation of the quantum field theory is achieved by introducing an
ultraviolet cutoff set by the Compton scale. The other main undertaking of this
paper is to quantify the fate of ground state entanglement and the Unruh effect
in the non-relativistic regime. Observing that the Unruh temperature vanishes
in the naive limit as the speed of light is taken to infinity motivates the
question: is the Unruh effect relativistic? It happens that this is closely
related to the former issues, as ground state entanglement causes obstructions
to localizability through the Reeh-Schlieder theorem.

fast computations, especially with streaming data and online learning, brings
renewed interest in faster, although possibly sub-optimal, solutions. To what
extent these algorithms may approximate a Bayesian solution is a problem of
interest, not always solved. On this background, in this paper we revisit a
sequential procedure proposed by Smith and Makov (1978) for unsupervised
learning and classification in finite mixtures, and developed by M. Newton and
Zhang (1999), for nonparametric mixtures. Newton's algorithm is simple and
fast, and theoretically intriguing. Although originally proposed as an
approximation of the Bayesian solution, its quasi-Bayes properties remain
unclear. We propose a novel methodological approach. We regard the algorithm as
a probabilistic learning rule, that implicitly defines an underlying
probabilistic model; and we find this model. We can then prove that it is,
asymptotically, a Bayesian, exchangeable mixture model. Moreover, while the
algorithm only offers a point estimate, our approach allows us to obtain an
asymptotic posterior distribution and asymptotic credible intervals for the
mixing distribution. Our results also provide practical hints for tuning the
algorithm and obtaining desirable properties, as we illustrate in a simulation

  estimates",,,,,"math.ST cs.LG stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a unified approach based on Wasserstein distance to
derive concentration bounds for empirical estimates for two broad classes of
risk measures defined in the paper. The classes of risk measures introduced
include as special cases well known risk measures from the finance literature
such as conditional value at risk (CVaR), optimized certainty equivalent risk,
spectral risk measures, utility-based shortfall risk, cumulative prospect
theory (CPT) value, rank dependent expected utility and distorted risk
measures. Two estimation schemes are considered, one for each class of risk
measures. One estimation scheme involves applying the risk measure to the
empirical distribution function formed from a collection of i.i.d. samples of
the random variable (r.v.), while the second scheme involves applying the same
procedure to a truncated sample. The bounds provided apply to three popular
classes of distributions, namely sub-Gaussian, sub-exponential and heavy-tailed
distributions. The bounds are derived by first relating the estimation error to
the Wasserstein distance between the true and empirical distributions, and then
using recent concentration bounds for the latter. Previous concentration bounds
are available only for specific risk measures such as CVaR and CPT-value. The
bounds derived in this paper are shown to either match or improve upon previous
bounds in cases where they are available. The usefulness of the bounds is
illustrated through an algorithm and the corresponding regret bound for a
stochastic bandit problem involving a general risk measure from each of the two
classes introduced in the paper.

  COLT 2019",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Algorithmic stability is a classical approach to understanding and analysis
of the generalization error of learning algorithms. A notable weakness of most
stability-based generalization bounds is that they hold only in expectation.
Generalization with high probability has been established in a landmark paper
of Bousquet and Elisseeff (2002) albeit at the expense of an additional
$\sqrt{n}$ factor in the bound. Specifically, their bound on the estimation
error of any $\gamma$-uniformly stable learning algorithm on $n$ samples and
range in $[0,1]$ is $O(\gamma \sqrt{n \log(1/\delta)} +
\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)/n})$ with probability $\geq 1-\delta$. The $\sqrt{n}$
overhead makes the bound vacuous in the common settings where $\gamma \geq
1/\sqrt{n}$. A stronger bound was recently proved by the authors (Feldman and
Vondrak, 2018) that reduces the overhead to at most $O(n^{1/4})$. Still, both
of these results give optimal generalization bounds only when $\gamma =
O(1/n)$.
  We prove a nearly tight bound of $O(\gamma \log(n)\log(n/\delta) +
\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)/n})$ on the estimation error of any $\gamma$-uniformly
stable algorithm. It implies that for algorithms that are uniformly stable with
$\gamma = O(1/\sqrt{n})$, estimation error is essentially the same as the
sampling error. Our result leads to the first high-probability generalization
bounds for multi-pass stochastic gradient descent and regularized ERM for
stochastic convex problems with nearly optimal rate --- resolving open problems
in prior work. Our proof technique is new and we introduce several analysis
tools that might find additional applications.

comparison to $z \approx 0$ and consider six observational metrics: the overall
abundance of HI and H2, their mass functions, gas fractions as a function of
stellar mass, the correlation between H2 and star formation rate, the spatial
distribution of gas, and the correlation between gas content and morphology. We
find generally good agreement between simulations and observations,
particularly for the gas fractions and the HI mass-size relation. The H2 mass
correlates with star formation rate as expected, revealing an almost constant
depletion time that evolves up to z = 2 as observed. However, we also discover
a number of tensions with varying degrees of significance, including an
overestimate of the total neutral gas abundance at z = 0 by about a factor of
two and a possible excess of satellites with no or very little neutral gas.
These conclusions are robust to the modelling of the HI/H2 transition. In terms
of their neutral gas properties, the IllustrisTNG simulations represent an
enormous improvement over the original Illustris run. All data used in this

set or the inferred values should then be used when the scaling relations are

fitting and heavy smoothing of the power spectrum. {\Delta\nu} was determined
using the method of autocorrelation of the power spectrum. The amplitude per
radial mode was determined using the method described in Kjeldsen et al.

substantial fraction of observed remnants and yet there is as yet no consensus

X-ray evidence of recombining plasmas. Recent calculations of remnant evolution
in a cloudy interstellar medium (ISM) that included thermal conduction but not
non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) showed promise in explaining observed surface
brightness distributions but could not determine if recombining plasmas were
present. In this paper, we present numerical hydrodynamical models of MMSNRs in
2D and 3D including explicit calculation of NEI effects. Both the spatial
ionization distribution and temperature-density diagrams show that
recombination occurs inside the simulated MMSNR, and that both adiabatic
expansion and thermal conduction cause recombination, albeit in different
regions. Features created by the adiabatic expansion stand out in the spatial
and temperature-density diagrams, but thermal conduction also plays a role.
Thus thermal conduction and adiabatic expansion both contribute significantly
to the cooling of high-temperature gas. Realistic observational data are
simulated with both spatial and spectral input from various regions. We also
discuss the possibility of analyzing the sources of recombination and dominant

structure in the combined phase and chemical space in the Galactic disk. To

Galactic disk that takes into account the clustered nature of star formation.
This model predicts that the combined phase and chemical space is rich in
substructure, and that this structure is sensitive to both the precise nature
of clustered star formation and the large-scale properties of the Galaxy. The
model self-consistently evolves 4 billion stars over the last 5 Gyr in a
realistic potential that includes an axisymmetric component, a bar, spiral
arms, and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). All stars are born in clusters with an
observationally-motivated range of initial conditions. As direct
\textit{N}-body calculations for billions of stars is computationally
infeasible, we have developed a method of initializing star cluster particles
to mimic the effects of direct \textit{N}-body effects, while the actual orbit
integrations are treated as test particles within the analytic potential. We
demonstrate that the combination of chemical and phase space information is
much more effective at identifying truly co-natal populations than either
chemical or phase space alone. Furthermore, we show that co-moving pairs of
stars are very likely to be co-natal if their velocity separation is $< 2$ km
s$^{-1}$ and their metallicity separation is $< 0.05$ dex. The results

relies on identifying the glide representation of the initial Bloch state

FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ (FTS) may also be topologically non-trivial. Should
the superconducting order be s$^{\pm}$, then FTS could be a higher order
topological superconductor with Helical Hinge Zero Modes (HHZM).To test the
presence of these modes we developed a new method for making normal
metal/superconductor junctions via 2D atomic crystal heterostructures. As
expected,junctions in contact with the hinge reveal a sharp zero-bias anomaly
whose suppression with temperature and magnetic field only along the c-axis are
completely consistent with the presence of HHZM. This feature is completely
absent when tunneling purely into the c-axis, and its characteristics are also
inconsistent with other origins of zero bias anomalies. Furthermore, additional
measurements with soft-point contacts in bulk samples with various Fe
interstitial contents demonstrate the intrinsic nature of the observed mode.
Thus we provide evidence that FTS is indeed a higher order topological
superconductor as well as a new method for probing 2D atomic crystals.

argue that a proper treatment of quasar driven winds is needed to alleviate
this problem. Our model compact galaxies have number densities in agreement
with observational estimates and they form most of their stars in small and low
angular momentum high-$z$ halos. GAEA predicts that a significant fraction of
compact galaxies forming at high-$z$ is bound to merge with larger structures
at lower redshifts: therefore they are not the progenitors of normal-size
passive galaxies at $z=0$. Our model also predicts a stellar-halo size relation
that is in good agreement with observational estimates. The ratio between
stellar size and halo size is proportional to the halo spin and does not depend
on stellar mass but for the most massive galaxies, where AGN feedback leads to
a significant decrease of the retention factor (from about 80 per cent to 20
per cent).

galaxies. It is required when converting (sub)millimeter broadband flux to
total infrared luminosity (L_IR), and hence star formation rate, in high-z
galaxies. However, different definitions of dust temperatures have been used in
the literature, leading to different physical interpretations of how ISM
conditions change with, e.g., redshift and star formation rate. In this paper,
we analyse the dust temperatures of massive (M* > 10^10 Msun) z=2-6 galaxies
with the help of high-resolution cosmological simulations from the Feedback in
Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. At z~2, our simulations successfully
predict dust temperatures in good agreement with observations. We find that
dust temperatures based on the peak emission wavelength increase with redshift,
in line with the higher star formation activity at higher redshift, and are
strongly correlated with the specific star formation rate. In contrast, the
mass-weighted dust temperature does not strongly evolve with redshift over
z=2-6 at fixed IR luminosity but is tightly correlated with L_IR at fixed z.
The mass-weighted temperature is important for accurately estimating the total
dust mass. We also analyse an 'equivalent' dust temperature for converting
(sub)millimeter flux density to total IR luminosity, and provide a fitting
formula as a function of redshift and dust-to-metal ratio. We find that
galaxies of higher equivalent (or higher peak) dust temperature ('warmer dust')
do not necessarily have higher mass-weighted temperatures. A 'two-phase'
picture for interstellar dust can explain the different scaling relations of
the various dust temperatures.

are greatly affected or even dominated by the near surface differential flow.
Unlike the contribution from rigid body rotation, this part of the gravity
field can be well estimated by linear theory when the differential rotation is
on cylinders and the corresponding gravity field arises from the higher order
moments directly introduced by that flow. In the context of an n = 1 polytrope,
we derive approximate analytical formulas for the gravity moments. We find that
$\Delta J_{2\mathrm{n}}$ is typically at most a few times $(-1)^{n+1} \; a \; q
\; d^{5/2}$, where $a$ is the amplitude of the differential rotation (as a
fraction of the background rigid body rotation), $q = \Omega^2 R^3 / G M$ is
the usual dimensionless measure of rotation for the planet (mass $M$, radius
$R$), and $d << 1$ is the characteristic depth of the flow as a fraction of the
planetary radius. Applied to Saturn, with $a$ set by the observed surface wind
amplitude, we find first that the observed signs of the $\Delta
J_{2\mathrm{n}}$ are a trivial consequence of the definition of the
corresponding Legendre polynomials, but the {\it Cassini} observations can not
be explained by a simple exponentially decaying flow and instead require a
substantial retrograde flow at depth and a larger $d$ than the simple scaling
suggests. This is consistent with the results reported by \citet{Iess2019}.
However, there is no fluid dynamical requirement that the flows observed in the
atmosphere are a guide to the flows thousands of km deeper. We explore a wide
range of flow depths and amplitudes which yield values for $\Delta
J_{\mathrm{n}}$ that are acceptable within the error estimates and thus
highlight the inherent non-uniqueness of inferences made from the higher order
gravity moments.

determine the uncertainties of diffractive PDFs. We discuss the novel aspects

diffractive PDFs, and discuss the fit quality and the stability upon variations

state (EOS) of cold, neutron-rich matter, while nuclear physics experiments
probe the EOS of hot, symmetric matter. Many dynamical phenomena, such as
core-collapse supernovae, the formation and cooling of proto-neutron stars, and
neutron star mergers, lie between these two regimes and depend on the EOS at
finite temperatures for matter with varying proton fractions. In this paper, we
introduce a new framework to accurately calculate the thermal pressure of
neutron-proton-electron matter at arbitrary density, temperature, and proton
fraction. This framework can be expressed using a set of five
physically-motivated parameters that span a narrow range of values for
realistic EOS and are able to capture the leading-order effects of degenerate
matter on the thermal pressure. We base two of these parameters on a new
approximation of the Dirac effective mass, with which we reproduce the thermal
pressure to within <~30% for a variety of realistic EOS at densities of
interest. Three additional parameters, based on the behavior of the symmetry
energy near the nuclear saturation density, allow for the extrapolation of any
cold EOS in beta-equilibrium to arbitrary proton fractions. Our model thus
allows a user to extend any cold nucleonic EOS, including piecewise-polytropes,
to arbitrary temperature and proton fraction, for use in calculations and
numerical simulations of astrophysical phenomena. We find that our formalism is
able to reproduce realistic finite-temperature EOS with errors of <~20% and
offers a 1-3 orders-of-magnitude improvement over existing ideal-fluid models.

active wave-front correction and multi-photon excitation, both used for deep

Land\'{e} g-factor and gate tunability of the junctions to control the
current-phase relation, and drive transitions between the $0$ and $\pi$-states.
This control over the free energy landscape allows us to construct a phase
diagram identifying these $0$ and $\pi$-regions, in agreement with theory. Our
results establish InSb quantum wells as a promising new material platform to
study the interplay between superconductivity, SOI and magnetism.

and vision, which involves capturing the performance of a human face and
transferring it to another 3D character. Learning 3D morphable model (3DMM)
parameters from 2D face images using convolutional neural networks is common in
2D face alignment, 3D face reconstruction etc. However, existing methods either
require an additional face detection step before retargeting or use a cascade
of separate networks to perform detection followed by retargeting in a
sequence. In this paper, we present a single end-to-end network to jointly
predict the bounding box locations and 3DMM parameters for multiple faces.
First, we design a novel multitask learning framework that learns a
disentangled representation of 3DMM parameters for a single face. Then, we
leverage the trained single face model to generate ground truth 3DMM parameters
for multiple faces to train another network that performs joint face detection
and motion retargeting for images with multiple faces. Experimental results
show that our joint detection and retargeting network has high face detection
accuracy and is robust to extreme expressions and poses while being faster than

transitions to $H\propto T^4$. The decays of $\phi$ imply a source of entropy

discrete R-symmetries of order M (Z_M^R) which emerge as remnants of Lorentz

process is driven by the competition between perimeter minimization and
minimization of volume changes. \par In the mathematical modeling of this

a term contributing to the driving energy functional, from the brittle case,

on the system of an arbitrary number of parallel, infinitely thin and
infinitely long coils (non-interacting, point magnetic fluxes) is modeled as
free semi-classical particle propagation on a topologically nontrivial
background. We show that in this case it is possible to obtain Berry's phase by
integration. First the case of a single coil is analyzed, upon which a
particular solution for the case of scattering on an arbitrary number of coils
is found. Considering the solution in the momentum representation, an analytic
continuation of the angle coordinate in the momentum space is introduced, in
accord with the nontrivial geometry of the configuration space. Finally, some
simple experiments with possible applications for quantum computing are
proposed.

lately in signal processing and communications areas due to its applications in
large size random matrices. However, it involves with massive mathematical
concepts and notations, and is really hard for a general reader to comprehend.
The main goal of this paper is to briefly describe this theory and its
application in random matrices as simple as possible so that it is easy to
follow. Applying free probability theory, one is able to calculate the
distributions of the eigenvalues/singular-values of large size random matrices
using only the second order statistics of the matrix entries. One of such
applications is the mutual information calculation of a massive MIMO system.

The Kelvin-Helmholtz mode is found at low magnetization and its growth rate
depends very weakly on the pitch parameter of the background magnetic field and
on rotation. The current driven mode is found at high magnetization, the values
of its growth rate and the wavenumber, corresponding to the maximum growth,
increase as we decrease the pitch parameter of the background magnetic field.
This mode is stabilized by rotation, especially, at high magnetization. The

value parabolic problems in \cite{Nguyen2019}, it is imperative to investigate
the convergence analysis of this regularization method in the stochastic
setting. In this paper, we positively unravel this open question by focusing on
a coupled system of Dirichlet reaction-diffusion equations with additive white
Gaussian noise on the terminal data. In this regard, the approximate problem is
designed by adding the so-called perturbing operator to the original problem
and by exploiting the Fourier reconstructed terminal data. By this way,
Gevrey-type source conditions are included, while we successfully maintain the
logarithmic stability estimate of the corresponding stabilized operator, which
is necessary for the error analysis. As the main theme of this work, we prove
the error bounds for the concentrations and for the concentration gradients,
driven by a large amount of weighted energy-like controls involving the
expectation operator. Compared to the classical error bounds in $L^2$ and $H^1$
that we obtained in the previous studies, our analysis here needs a higher
smoothness of the true terminal data to ensure their reconstructions from the
stochastic fashion. Two numerical examples are provided to corroborate the
theoretical results.

employs this representation for predicting pulmonary edema severity. Our
experimental results suggest that modeling the distribution of images jointly

break the temporal symmetry and induce a power-law decay of the Hamiltonian

in this setting. First, increasing an arbitrary entry of a pairwise comparison
matrix is not allowed to result in a counter-intuitive rank reversal, that is,
the favoured alternative in the corresponding row cannot be ranked lower than
any other alternative if this was not the case before the change (rank
monotonicity). Second, the same modification should not decrease the normalised

satisfied by the geometric mean method but violated by the eigenvector method.
The axioms do not uniquely determine the geometric mean. The relationship

centered around the $\vec{Q}$=(0, 0, 2) position that gradually evolves to
H$\sim$ 0.2 with decreasing temperature and/or energy transfers. The response

suggest that the antiferromagnetic phase in CeRhSi$_{3}$ is driven by weakly
correlated relaxing localized Kramers doublets and that CeRhSi$_{3}$ at ambient

state and a Kondo screened phase where static magnetism is predominately
absent.

annihilation of spin vortices does not take the system to the equilibrium
state. A nonequilibrium background of long wavelength spin waves remain at the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature, an order of magnitude hotter than
the equilibrium temperature. The coarsening continues through a second much
slower scale invariant process with a length scale that grows with time as
$t^{1/3}$. This second regime of coarsening is associated with spin wave energy
transport from low to high wavevectors, bringing about the the eventual
equilibrium state. Because the relevant spin waves are noninteracting, the
transport occurs through a dynamic coupling to other degrees of freedom of the
system. The transport displays features of a spin wave energy cascade,
providing a potential profitable connection with the emerging field of spin
wave turbulence. Strongly coupling the system to a reservoir destroys the
second regime of coarsening, allowing the system to thermalise following the
annihilation of vortices.

comes up in the design of such adaptive algorithms is to calibrate a so-called
step-size or learning rate hyperparameter depending on variance, gradient
norms, etc. A recent technique promises to overcome this difficulty by
maintaining multiple learning rates in parallel. This technique has been
applied in the MetaGrad algorithm for online convex optimization and the Squint
algorithm for prediction with expert advice. However, in both cases the user
still has to provide in advance a Lipschitz hyperparameter that bounds the norm
of the gradients. Although this hyperparameter is typically not available in
advance, tuning it correctly is crucial: if it is set too small, the methods
may fail completely; but if it is taken too large, performance deteriorates
significantly. In the present work we remove this Lipschitz hyperparameter by
designing new versions of MetaGrad and Squint that adapt to its optimal value
automatically. We achieve this by dynamically updating the set of active
learning rates. For MetaGrad, we further improve the computational efficiency
of handling constraints on the domain of prediction, and we remove the need to

hypersurface of the $n$-dimensional Euclidean unit sphere. Let us denote by
$|A|^2$ the square of the norm of the second fundamental form and $J(f)=-\Delta
f-nf-|A|^2f$ the stability operator. It is known that the index (the number of
negative eigenvalues of $J$) is 1 when $M$ is a totally geodesic sphere, and it
is $n+3$ when $M$ is a Clifford minimal hypersurface. It has been conjectured
that for any other minimal hypersurface, the index must be greater than $n+3$.
One partial result for this conjecture states that if the index is $n+3$ and
$M$ is not Clifford, then $\int_M |A|^2<n|M|$ where $|M|$ is the $n$

of macroscopic fibres of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The core idea is to treat
such a fibre as a network of CNT bundles, similar to the structure of
high-performance polymer fibres, with tensile properties defined by the CNT
bundle orientation distribution function (ODF), shear modulus and shear
strength. Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering measurements on individual
fibres are used to determine the initial ODF and its evolution during in-situ
tensile testing. This enables prediction of tensile modulus, strength and
fracture envelope, with remarkable agreement with experimental data for fibres
produced in-house with different constituent CNTs and for different draw
ratios, as well as with literature data. The parameters extracted from the
model include: CNT bundle shear strength, shear modulus and tensile strength.
These are in agreement with data for commercial high-performance fibres,
although high compared with values for single-crystal graphite and short
individual CNTs. The manuscript also discusses the unusually high fracture
energy of CNT fibres and exceptionally high figure of merit for ballistic
protection. The model predicts that small improvements in orientation would
lead to superior ballistic peformance than any synthetic high-peformance fiber,
with values of strain wave velocity ($U^{1/3}$) exceeding $1000 m/s$.

an ionic or covalent bond, and is accomplished by a very different mechanism:
the Rydberg electron, elastically scattering off of the ground state atoms,
exerts a weak attractive force sufficient to form the molecule in long-range
oscillatory potential wells. In the last decade this topic has burgeoned into a
vibrant and mature subfield of atomic and molecular physics following the
rapidly developing capability of experiment to observe and manipulate these
molecules. This tutorial focuses on three areas where this experimental
progress has demanded more sophisticated theoretical descriptions: the
structure of polyatomic molecules, the influence of electronic and nuclear
spin, and the behavior of these molecules in external fields. The main results
are a collection of potential energy curves and electronic wave functions which
together describe the physics of Rydberg molecules. Additionally, to facilitate
future progress in this field, this tutorial provides a general overview of the
current state of experiment and theory.

classical capacity is superadditive i.e. more classical information can be
transmitted by quantum encoding strategies entangled across multiple channel
uses as compared to unentangled quantum encoding strategies. Hastings' proof
used Haar random unitaries to exhibit superadditivity. In this paper we show
that a unitary chosen uniformly at random from an approximate $n^{2/3}$-design
gives rise to a quantum channel with superadditive classical Holevo capacity,
where $n$ is the dimension of the unitary exhibiting the Stinespring dilation
of the channel superoperator.
  We prove a sharp Dvoretzky-like theorem (similar to Aubrun, Szarek, Werner,
2010) stating that, with high probability under the choice of a unitary from an
approximate $t$-design, random subspaces of large dimension make a Lipschitz
function take almost constant value. Such theorems were known earlier only for
Haar random unitaries. We obtain our result by appealing to Low's technique for
proving concentration of measure for an approximate $t$-design, combined with a
stratified analysis of the variational behaviour of Lipschitz functions on the
unit sphere in high dimension. The stratified analysis is the main technical
advance of this work.
  Finally we also show that for any $p>1$, approximate unitary $(n^{1.7} \log
n)$-designs give rise to channels violating subadditivity of R\'{e}nyi
$p$-entropy. In addition to stratified analysis, the proof of this result uses
a new technique of approximating a monotonic differentiable function defined on
a closed bounded interval and its derivative by moderate degree polynomials
which should be of independent interest. Hence, our work can be viewed as a
partial derandomisation of Hastings' result and a step towards the quest of
finding an explicit quantum channel with superadditive classical Holevo
capacity.

They have recently gained significant attention in the community of homotopy
type theory and univalent foundations, where types carry the structure of such
higher groupoids. Bezem, Coquand, and Huber have presented a constructive model
of univalence using a specific cube category, which we call the BCH category.
  The higher categories encoded with the BCH category have the property that
all morphisms are invertible, mirroring the fact that equality is symmetric.
This might not always be desirable: the field of directed type theory considers
a notion of equality that is not necessarily invertible.
  This motivates us to suggest a category of twisted cubes which avoids
built-in invertibility. Our strategy is to first develop several alternative
(but equivalent) presentations of the BCH category using morphisms between
suitably defined graphs. Starting from there, a minor modification allows us to
define our category of twisted cubes. We prove several first results about this
category, and our work suggests that twisted cubes combine properties of cubes
with properties of globes and simplices (tetrahedra).

become one of the major components of smart cities. To take full advantage of
the smart grid, the capability of intelligent scheduling and planning of
electricity delivery is essential. In practice, many factors have an impact on
electricity consumption, which necessitates information fusion technologies for
a thorough understanding. For this purpose, researchers have investigated
methodologies for collecting electricity consumption related information and
variant multi-factor power consumption forecasting models. In addition,
conducting a comprehensive analysis and obtaining an accurate evaluation of
power consumption are the premise and basis for a more robust and efficient
power grid design and transformation. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore
forecasting models that are able to reflect the power consumption changes and
internal relations within fusional information effectively. Making electricity
consumption forecasting based on the neural network has been a popular research
topic in recent years, and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm
has been recognized as a mature and effective method. In this paper, BPNN is
adopted to forecast the electricity consumption using Pecan Street, a community
with a relatively large-scale smart grid, as a case study, and takes multiple
factors into account, such as weather condition, weekend and holidays. The
influences of each factor have been evaluated for a deeper insight. We hope

developed in this article. MFDE is robust to the presence of baseline wanders,
or trends, in the data. We evaluate MFDE, compared with popular multiscale
sample entropy (MSE), and the recently introduced multiscale dispersion entropy
(MDE), on selected synthetic data and five neurological diseases' datasets: 1)
focal and non-focal electroencephalograms (EEGs); 2) walking stride interval

EEGs for controls and Alzheimer's disease patients; and 5) eye movement data
for Parkinson's disease and ataxia. MFDE dealt with the problem of undefined
MSE values and, compared with MDE, led to more stable entropy values over the
scale factors for pink noise. Overall, MFDE was the fastest and most consistent
method for the discrimination of different states of neurological data,
especially where the mean value of a time series considerably changes along the
signal (e.g., eye movement data). This study shows that MFDE is a relevant new

where the $v$-th index is the number of disagreements at vertex $v$. Recently,
Puleo and Milenkovic (ICML '16) initiated the study of the Correlation
Clustering framework in which the objectives were more general functions of the
disagreements vector. In this paper, we study algorithms for minimizing
$\ell_q$ norms $(q \geq 1)$ of the disagreements vector for both arbitrary and
complete graphs. We present the first known algorithm for minimizing the
$\ell_q$ norm of the disagreements vector on arbitrary graphs and also provide
an improved algorithm for minimizing the $\ell_q$ norm $(q \geq 1)$ of the
disagreements vector on complete graphs. We also study an alternate
cluster-wise local objective introduced by Ahmadi, Khuller and Saha (IPCO '19),
which aims to minimize the maximum number of disagreements associated with a
cluster. We also present an improved ($2 + \varepsilon$) approximation
algorithm for this objective. Finally, we compliment our algorithmic results
for minimizing the $\ell_q$ norm of the disagreements vector with some hardness
results.

broadband correlations. The radio emission originates in a compact,
self-absorbed jet, however the origin of the X-ray emission is still debated:
jet base or corona? We fit 20 quasi-simultaneous radio, IR, optical and X-ray

2010--2011, with a composite corona + jet model, where inverse Compton emission
from both regions contributes to the X-ray emission. Using a recently-proposed

attempt to explain both the spectral and evolving timing characteristics, with
the model. We find the X-ray spectra are best fit by inverse Compton scattering
in a dominant hot corona ($kT_{\rm e}\sim$ hundreds of keV). However, radio and
IR-optical constraints imply a non-negligible contribution from inverse Compton
scattering off hotter electrons ($kT_{\rm e} \ge 511$~keV) in the base of the
jets, ranging from a few up to $\sim50$\% of the integrated 3--100~keV flux. We
also find that the physical properties of the jet show interesting correlations

Starting from the generalized Coulomb gauge we transform operators into the

everywhere. We find the generating function of the gauge transformation to
carry out the corresponding unitary transformation of the Hamiltonian and show
that in the true Coulomb gauge the Hamiltonian of a particle near a polarizable

second-quantised operator on equal footing with the vector field operators. We
demonstrate that this term contains part of the electrostatic energy of the

the theory guarantees that the total interaction energy in all cases equals the
well known result obtainable by the method of images when working in
generalized Coulomb gauge. The mathematical tools we have developed allow us to
work out explicitly the equal-time commutation relations and shed some light on

that there is an obscuring region which is responsible for this.
  The line profiles are also changing. The mean profiles of the broad Halpha

  1.QMIP* systems with honest zero-knowledge can be converted into general
zero-knowledge systems without any assumptions.
  2.QMIP* has computational quantum zero-knowledge systems if a natural

  One of the main tools is a test (called the GHZ test) that uses GHZ states
shared by the provers, which prevents the verifier's attack in the above two
results. Another main tool is what we call the Local Hamiltonian based

multiple atoms coupled to a waveguide and highlight the modifications they
entail in regards to single-photon transport properties. A prominent upshot of
these interference phenomena is the resonant suppression of the reflection
amplitude, which leads to the observation of multiple Fano minima in the
reflection spectrum. Such minima determine the points at which transparency is
induced in the system. By taking recourse to the real-space Hamiltonian
framework, we calculate analytically the reflectivity and transmissivity for a
one-dimensional waveguide that evanescently couples to a chain of equally
spaced quantum emitters. The inter-emitter spacing relative to the wavelength
of the propagating photon, leading to a waveguide-mediated ""phase-coupling""
between the atoms, is found to fundamentally affect the existence of Fano
minima. For a chain of $N$ atoms, the number of minima can be at most $N-1$.
However, suitable choices of the phase can suppress the discernibility of the
full range of roots in the reflection spectrum. A principal observation for the
case of multiple emitters is the emergence of super-Gaussian characteristics
close to zero-detuning and consequently, a plateau-shaped broadband spectrum in
the region of high reflectivity. For a large chain size, the plateau gets
transformed into a flat-topped quasi-rectangular profile in the frequency
domain.

exponentially increasing sensitivity to non-ideal effects for all but truly
exceptional evolutions. On a time scale that depends only logarithmically on
the magnitude of non-ideality, an evolving magnetic field will generally reach
a state of fast magnetic reconnection. The effects of fast magnetic
reconnection proceed at a rate determined by Alfv\'enic, not resistive,
physics. The best known of these effects are associated with the transfer of
magnetic field energy to the plasma and the conservation of magnetic helicity,
which limits the energy transfer. As will be shown, weak non-ideality implies
helicity conservation in regions bounded by magnetic surfaces or rigid perfect
conductors. But, weak non-ideality makes the rapid transfer of energy subtle.
This transfer can be understood by the drive for Alfv\'en waves and two other
effects, which are present even in an ideal evolution, an effective parallel
electric field $\mathcal{E}_{||}$, which can accelerate particles despite the
particle acceleration due to the true parallel electric field $E_{||}$ being
negligible, and a coefficient $\nu_K$, which gives a rate for exponentiation of
the kinetic energy of particle motion along the magnetic field. Classical
theories of reconnection are two-dimensional and exclude the exponentially
increasing sensitivity that is robustly present for magnetic fields in
three-dimensional space.

are delivered to individuals via wearables or smartphones to facilitate
health-related behavior change. Micro-randomized trials (MRT) are an
experimental design for developing mobile health interventions. In an MRT the
treatments are randomized numerous times for each individual over course of the
trial. Along with assessing treatment effects, behavioral scientists aim to
understand between-person heterogeneity in the treatment effect. A natural
approach is the familiar linear mixed model. However, directly applying linear
mixed models is problematic because potential moderators of the treatment
effect are frequently endogenous---that is, may depend on prior treatment. We
discuss model interpretation and biases that arise in the absence of additional
assumptions when endogenous covariates are included in a linear mixed model. In
particular, when there are endogenous covariates, the coefficients no longer
have the customary marginal interpretation. However, these coefficients still
have a conditional-on-the-random-effect interpretation. We provide an
additional assumption that, if true, allows scientists to use standard software
to fit linear mixed model with endogenous covariates, and person-specific
predictions of effects can be provided. As an illustration, we assess the
effect of activity suggestion in the HeartSteps MRT and analyze the

($\sim$85--116 GHz) obtained with the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. In IC 342
the line survey with high spectral resolution at the 3 mm region was reported
for the first time. NGC 1068 is a nearby gas-rich galaxy with X-rays from an
active galactic nucleus (AGN), and NGC 253 and IC 342 are nearby gas-rich
galaxies with prototypical starbursts. These galaxies are useful to study the
impacts of X-rays and ultraviolet radiation on molecular abundances. The survey
was carried out with the resulting rms noise level of a few mK ($T\rm{_A^*}$).
As a result we could obtain almost complete data of these galaxies at the 3 mm
region: We detected 19--23 molecular species depending on the galaxies
including several new detections (e.g., cyclic-C$_3$H$_2$ in IC 342). We found
that the intensities of HCN, CN, and HC$_3$N relative to $^{13}$CO are
significantly strong in NGC 1068 compared to those in NGC 253 and IC 342. On
the other hand, CH$_3$CCH was not detected in NGC 1068. We obtained these
results with the narrow beam (15$''$.2--19$''$.1) of the 45 m telescope among
the single-dish telescopes, and in particular selectively observed the
molecular gas close to the circumnuclear disk (CND) in NGC 1068. Our line
intensities in NGC 1068 were compared to those obtained with the IRAM 30 m

adversarial environments, where the objective is to design the trajectory of a
robot to reach a desired final state despite the unknown and arbitrary action
of an attacker. In particular, we consider a robot moving in a two-dimensional
space and equipped with two sensors, namely, a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) sensor and a Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) sensor. The
attacker can arbitrarily spoof the readings of the GNSS sensor and the robot
control input so as to maximally deviate his trajectory from the nominal
precomputed path. We derive explicit and constructive conditions for the
existence of undetectable attacks, through which the attacker deviates the
robot trajectory in a stealthy way. Conversely, we characterize the existence
of secure trajectories, which guarantee that the robot either moves along the
nominal trajectory or that the attack remains detectable. We show that secure
trajectories can only exist between a subset of states, and provide a numerical
mechanism to compute them. We illustrate our findings through several numerical
studies, and discuss that our methods are applicable to different models of
robot dynamics, including unicycles. More generally, our results show how
control design affects security in systems with nonlinear dynamics.

practical importance. Broadly, if a system $\dot{x} = f(x,u)$ is locally
asymptotically stabilizable, we are guaranteed a feedback controller $u(x)$
that forces convergence to an equilibrium for trajectories initialized
sufficiently close to it. A necessary condition was given by Brockett: such
controllers exist only when $f$ is open at the equilibrium. Recently, Gupta,
Jafari, Kipka and Mordukhovich considered a modification to this condition,
replacing Brockett's topological openness by the linear openness property of
modern variational analysis. In this paper, we show that under the linear
openness assumption there is a local diffeomorphism of neighborhoods of the
equilibirum on which the system is exponentially stabilizable by means of
continuous stationary feedback laws. Introducing a transversality property and
relating it to the above diffeomorphism, we prove that linear openness and
transversality on a punctured neighborhood of an equilibrium is sufficient for
local exponential stabilizability of systems with a rank deficient
linearization.The main result goes beyond the usual Kalman and Hautus criteria
for the existence of exponential stabilizing feedback laws, since it allows us
to handle systems for which exponential stabilization is achieved through
higher-order terms. However, it is implemented so far under a rather
restrictive row-rank conditions. This suggests a twofold approach to the use of
these properties: a point-wise version is enough to ensure stability via the
linearization, while a local version is enough to overcome deficiencies in the
linearization.

for a system with large-scale antenna arrays. This work studies the
optimization of the analog and digital components of the hybrid beamforming
solution for remote radio heads (RRHs) in a downlink cloud radio access network
(C-RAN) architecture. Digital processing is carried out at a baseband
processing unit (BBU) in the ""cloud"" and the precoded baseband signals are
quantized prior to transmission to the RRHs via finite-capacity fronthaul
links. In this system, we consider two different channel state information
(CSI) scenarios: 1) ideal CSI at the BBU 2) imperfect effective CSI.
Optimization of digital beamforming and fronthaul quantization strategies at
the BBU as well as analog radio frequency (RF) beamforming at the RRHs is a
coupled problem, since the effect of the quantization noise at the receiver
depends on the precoding matrices. The resulting joint optimization problem is
examined with the goal of maximizing the weighted downlink sum-rate and the
network energy efficiency. Fronthaul capacity and per-RRH power constraints are
enforced along with constant modulus constraint on the RF beamforming matrices.
For the case of perfect CSI, a block coordinate descent scheme is proposed
based on the weighted minimum-mean-square-error approach by relaxing the
constant modulus constraint of the analog beamformer. Also, we present the
impact of imperfect CSI on the weighted sum-rate and network energy efficiency
performance, and the algorithm is extended by applying the sample average
approximation. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed

performance and security. To combat this problem, several automated techniques
have been proposed to debloat software. A key metric used in many of these
works to demonstrate improved security is code reuse gadget count reduction.
The use of this metric is based on the prevailing idea that reducing the number
of gadgets available in a software package reduces its attack surface and makes
mounting a gadget-based code reuse exploit such as return-oriented programming
(ROP) more difficult for an attacker. In this paper, we challenge this idea and
show through a variety of realistic debloating scenarios the flaws inherent to
the gadget count reduction metric. Specifically, we demonstrate that software
debloating can achieve high gadget count reduction rates, yet fail to limit an
attacker's ability to construct an exploit. Worse yet, in some scenarios high
gadget count reduction rates conceal instances in which software debloating
makes security worse by introducing new, useful gadgets. To address these
issues, we propose a set of four new metrics for measuring security
improvements realized through software debloating that are quality-oriented
rather than quantity-oriented. We show that these metrics can identify when
debloating negatively impacts security and be efficiently calculated using our
static binary analysis tool, the Gadget Set Analyzer. Finally, we demonstrate
the utility of these metrics in two realistic case studies: iterative
debloating and debloater evaluation.

potential to significantly impact on our daily lives by offering a new way to
manipulate and interact with virtual information, minimizing visual discomfort
due to the vergence-accommodation conflict remains a challenge. Emerging AR
technologies often exploit focus-tunable optics to address this problem.
Although they demonstrated improved depth perception by enabling proper focus
cues, a bulky form factor of focus-tunable optics prevents their use in the
form of a pair of eyeglasses. Herein, we describe an ultrathin, focus-tunable
liquid crystal (LC) diffractive lens with a large aperture, a low weight, and a
low operating voltage. In addition, we show that the polarization dependence of
the lens, which is an inherent optical property of LC lenses, can be eliminated
using birefringent thin films as substrates and by aligning the optical axes of
the birefringent substrates and LC at a specific angle. The polarization
independence eliminates the need for a polarizer, thus further reducing the
form factor of the optical system. Next, we demonstrate a prototype of AR
glasses with addressable focal planes using the ultrathin lens. The prototype
AR glasses can adjust the accommodation distance of the virtual image,
mitigating the vergence-accommodation conflict without substantially
compromising the form factor or image quality. This research on ultrathin lens
technology shows promising potential for developing compact optical displays in
various applications.

cellular systems, are expected to operate on multiple frequency bands. This
paper considers the band assignment (BA) problem in dual-band systems, where
the basestation (BS) chooses one of the two available frequency bands
(centimeter-wave and millimeter-wave bands) to communicate with the user
equipment (UE). While the millimeter-wave band might offer higher data rate,
there is a significant probability of outage during which the communication
should be carried on the (more reliable) centimeter-wave band. With mobility,
the BA can be perceived as a sequential problem, where the BS uses previously
observed information to predict the best band for a future time step.
  We formulate the BA as a binary classification problem and propose supervised
Machine Learning (ML) solutions. We study the problem when both the BS and the
UE use (i) omnidirectional antennas and (ii) both use directional antennas. In
the omnidirectional case, we derive analytical benchmark solutions based on the
Gaussian Process (GP) assumption for the inter-band shadow fading. In the
directional case, where the labeling is shown to be complex, we propose an
efficient labeling approach based on the Viterbi Algorithm (VA). We compare the
performances for two channel models: (i) a stochastic channel and (ii) a
ray-tracing based channel.

Bok telescope and improve the astrometry of BASS, a distortion solution for the
Bok telescope is made. In the past, we used a single lookup table to correct
all the positional errors. However, this method can not be applied to the
reduction of the observation for the Bok telescope where four CCD chips are
equipped with. Then quite different from our previous method, two third-order
polynomials were used to fit the lookup table. By using the polynomial
Geometric Distortion (called GD hereafter) correction the astrometry of BASS is
improved greatly. Moreover, an additional lookup table correction is found to
be more effective to obtain a final GD. The results show that the positional
measurement precision of the appropriate bright stars is estimated at about 20

national databases of small-scale solar PV do not exist; those that do are
limited in their spatial resolution, typically aggregated up to state or
national levels. While several promising approaches for solar PV detection have
been published, strategies for evaluating the performance of these models are
often highly heterogeneous from study to study. The resulting comparison of
these methods for practical applications for energy assessments becomes
challenging and may imply that the reported performance evaluations are overly

quantizers, in which transmitted signals are corrupted by fading and additive
noise. For such wireless systems, a universal lower bound on the average symbol
error probability (SEP), correct for all M-ary modulation schemes, is obtained
when the number of quantization bits is not enough to resolve M signal points.
In the special case of M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK), the optimum maximum
likelihood detector for equi-probable signal points is derived. Utilizing the
structure of the derived optimum receiver, a general average SEP expression for
M-PSK modulation with n-bit quantization is obtained when the wireless channel
is subject to fading with a circularly-symmetric distribution. Adopting this
result for Nakagami-m fading channels, easy-to-evaluate expressions for the
average SEP for M-PSK modulation are further derived. It is shown that a
transceiver architecture with n-bit quantization is asymptotically optimum in
terms of communication reliability if n is greater than or equal to log_2(M
+1). That is, the decay exponent for the average SEP is the same and equal to m
with infinite-bit and n-bit quantizers for n is greater than or equal to
log_2(M+1). On the other hand, it is only equal to half and 0 for n = log_2(M)

illustrate the derived results and energy efficiency gains obtained by means of
low-resolution quantizers.

impossible to extend the theta operators to the whole Shimura variety. On the

contrary, loss of a methane from cII causes negligible deformation. The
electronic density of states and the energy band gap of the cII is almost the

is only responsive to light in the ultraviolet region, revealing their similar

negligible influence to the lattice structure and therefore to the electronic

a nodal and nematic $\Delta_{4x}$ state is favorable for stronger warping or

the need to learn the prior (\emph{meta-exploration}) with the need to leverage

(ii) accounting for uncertainty in the estimated prior by appropriately
""widening"" the estimated prior as a function of its estimation error. We
introduce a novel prior alignment technique to analyze the regret of Thompson
sampling with a mis-specified prior, which may be of independent interest.
Unlike prior-independent approaches, our algorithm's meta regret grows
sublinearly in $N$, demonstrating that the price of an unknown prior in
Thompson sampling can be negligible in experiment-rich environments (large
$N$). Numerical experiments on synthetic and real auto loan data demonstrate
that our algorithm significantly speeds up learning compared to

ubiquitously utilized method. Its effectiveness is well established when the
covariates exhibit low-rank structure. However, its ability to handle settings
with noisy, missing, and mixed-valued, i.e., discrete and continuous,
covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge. As the
main contribution of this work we establish the robustness of PCR, without any
change, in this respect and provide meaningful finite-sample analysis. To do
so, we establish that PCR is equivalent to performing linear regression after
pre-processing the covariate matrix via hard singular value thresholding
(HSVT). As a result, in the context of counterfactual analysis using
observational data, we show PCR is equivalent to the recently proposed robust
variant of the synthetic control method, known as robust synthetic control
(RSC). As an immediate consequence, we obtain finite-sample analysis of the RSC
estimator that was previously absent. As an important contribution to the
synthetic controls literature, we establish that an (approximate) linear
synthetic control exists in the setting of a generalized factor model or latent
variable model; traditionally in the literature, the existence of a synthetic
control needs to be assumed to exist as an axiom. We further discuss a
surprising implication of the robustness property of PCR with respect to noise,
i.e., PCR can learn a good predictive model even if the covariates are
tactfully transformed to preserve differential privacy. Finally, this work
advances the state-of-the-art analysis for HSVT by establishing stronger
guarantees with respect to the $\ell_{2, \infty}$-norm rather than the
Frobenius norm as is commonly done in the matrix estimation literature, which
may be of interest in its own right.

formulating four-dimensional gravity as a gauge theory of the Poincar\'e group,
spontaneously broken to the Lorentz, we attempt to construct a four-dimensional
gravitational model on the fuzzy de Sitter spacetime. In turn, first we
consider the SO(1,4) subgroup of the SO(1,5) algebra, in which we were led to,
as we want to gauge the isometry part of the full symmetry. Then, the
construction of a gauge theory on such a noncommutative space directs us to use
an extension of the gauge group, the SO(1,5)$\times$U(1), and fix its
representation. Moreover, a 2-form dynamic gauge field is included in the
theory for reasons of covariance of the transformation of the field strength
tensor. Finally, the gauge theory is considered to be spontaneously broken to
the Lorentz group with an extension of a U(1), i.e. SO(1,3)$\times$U(1). The
latter defines the four-dimensional noncommutative gravity action which can
lead to equations of motion, whereas the breaking induces the imposition of
constraints that will lead to expressions relating the gauge fields. It should

input for various nuclear processes bearing astrophysical significance. In this
paper, we emphasize on the important role of the asymptotic normalization
coefficients for description of the $^{13}\rm{N}\longrightarrow

scattering phase-shift of proton and neutron on $^{12}\rm{C}$, we find the
asymptotic normalization coefficients which determine the tail of the bound

$^{13}\rm{N}$ and $^{13}\rm{C}$ within the single-particle approach using the
inverse scattering theory. These wave functions are used to determine the
nuclear matrix element for calculation of the half-life and log{\textit ft}
values of $\beta^+$ decay of $^{13}\rm{N}$. The calculated values of the
log{\textit ft} and half-life are smaller than the measured values when the
single-particle wave functions are employed. Using overlap functions, instead

metamorphosis model proposed by Trouv\'e, Younes and coworkers casts this
problem in the frame of Riemannian geometry and geodesic paths between images.
The associated metric in the space of images incorporates dissipation caused by
a viscous flow transporting image intensities and its variations along motion
paths. In many applications, images are maps from the image domain into a
manifold (e.g. in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) the manifold of symmetric
positive definite matrices with a suitable Riemannian metric). In this paper,
we propose a generalized metamorphosis model for manifold-valued images, where
the range space is a finite-dimensional Hadamard manifold. A corresponding time
discrete version was presented by Neumayer et al. based on the general
variational time discretization proposed by Berkels et al. Here, we prove the
Mosco--convergence of the time discrete metamorphosis functional to the
proposed manifold-valued metamorphosis model, which implies the convergence of
time discrete geodesic paths to a geodesic path in the (time continuous)
metamorphosis model. In particular, the existence of geodesic paths is
established. In fact, images as maps into Hadamard manifold are not only
relevant in applications, but it is also shown that the joint convexity of the
distance function which characterizes Hadamard manifolds is a crucial
ingredient to establish existence of the metamorphosis model.

activation for video delivery may introduce delays, different timescales for

pulsations of the atmosphere, which extends to a region where the conditions
are adequate for dust grains to form. Radiation pressure acts on these grains
which, coupled to the gas, drive a massive outflow. The details of this process
are not clear, including which molecules are involved in the condensation of
dust grains.
  Aims. To study the role of the SiO molecule in the process of dust formation
and mass-loss in M-type AGB stars.
  Methods. Using the IRAM NOEMA interferometer we observed the $^{28}$SiO and
$^{29}$SiO $J=3-2$, $v=0$ emission from the inner circumstellar envelope of the
evolved stars IK Tau and IRC+10011. We computed azimuthally averaged emission
profiles to compare the observations to models using a molecular excitation and
ray-tracing code for SiO thermal emission.
  Results. We observed circular symmetry in the emission distribution. We also
found that the source diameter varies only marginally with radial velocity,
which is not the expected behavior for envelopes expanding at an almost
constant velocity. The adopted density, velocity, and abundance laws, together
with the mass-loss rate, which best fit the observations, give us information
on the chemical behavior of the SiO molecule and its role in the dust formation
process.
  Conclusions. The results indicate that there is a strong coupling between the
depletion of gas phase SiO and gas acceleration in the inner envelope. This
could be explained by the condensation of SiO into dust grains.

  Breast Cancer Classification","Accepted to ISBI'19",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One issue with computer based histopathology image analysis is that the size
of the raw image is usually very large. Taking the raw image as input to the
deep learning model would be computationally expensive while resizing the raw
image to low resolution would incur information loss. In this paper, we present
a novel deep hybrid attention approach to breast cancer classification. It
first adaptively selects a sequence of coarse regions from the raw image by a
hard visual attention algorithm, and then for each such region it is able to
investigate the abnormal parts based on a soft-attention mechanism. A recurrent
network is then built to make decisions to classify the image region and also
to predict the location of the image region to be investigated at the next time
step. As the region selection process is non-differentiable, we optimize the
whole network through a reinforcement approach to learn an optimal policy to
classify the regions. Based on this novel Look, Investigate and Classify
approach, we only need to process a fraction of the pixels in the raw image
resulting in significant saving in computational resources without sacrificing
performances. Our approach is evaluated on a public breast cancer
histopathology database, where it demonstrates superior performance to the
state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, achieving around 96\% classification
accuracy while only 15% of raw pixels are used.

oscillations in these devices, and our simulations confirm these to be an
interference effect of the transverse sub-bands in the nanowire. We add
disorder to model coherent scattering and study its effect on the critical
current oscillations, with an aim to gain a thorough understanding of the
experiments. The oscillations in the disordered junction are highly sensitive
to the particular realisation of the random disorder potential, and to the gate
voltage. A macroscopic current measurement thus gives us information about the
microscopic profile of the junction. Finally, we study dephasing in the channel
by including elastic phase-breaking interactions. The oscillations thus
obtained are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data, and this
signifies the essential role of phase-breaking processes in III-V semiconductor

scales relevant for management, with particularly large knowledge gaps for
temperate forests and for taxa other than trees. We built a comprehensive
dataset of Central European temperate forest structure and multi-taxonomic

above-ground live carbon stocks and (a) taxon-specific richness, (b) a unified
multidiversity index. We used Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis to explore
individual species' responses to changing above-ground carbon stocks and to

velocity with interplanetary scintillation observations at the Institute for
Space-Earth Environmental Research, and the coronal hole distribution computed
by potential field calculations of the solar corona using synoptic magnetogram
data obtained at Kitt Peak National Solar Observatory. First, by comparing the
solar wind velocity (V) and the brightness temperature (T_b) in the polar
region, we found good correlation coefficients (CCs) between V and T_b in the
polar regions, CC = 0.91 (0.83) for the northern (southern) polar region, and
we obtained the V-T_b relationship as V =12.6 (T_b-10,667)^{1/2}+432. We also
confirmed that the CC of V-T_b is higher than those of V-B and V-B/f, where B
and f are the polar magnetic field strength and magnetic flux expansion rate,
respectively. These results indicate that T_b is a more direct parameter than B
or B/f for expressing solar wind velocity. Next, we analyzed the long-term
variation of the polar brightening and its relation to the area of the polar
coronal hole (A). As a result, we found that the polar brightening matches the
probability distribution of the predicted coronal hole and that the CC between
T_b and A is remarkably high, CC = 0.97. This result indicates that the polar
brightening is strongly coupled to the size of the polar coronal hole.
Therefore, the reasonable correlation of V-T_b is explained by V-A. In
addition, by considering the anti-correlation between A and f found in a
previous study, we suggest that the V-T_b relationship is another expression of
the Wang-Sheeley relationship (V-1/f) in the polar regions.

obtained at the Spanish 10.4m GTC telescope, allowed us to demonstrate the lens
nature of the system, that consists of a Lyman-break galaxy, not a QSO as is
usually the case, at z = 3.03 lensed by a galaxy at z=0.556. Combining the new
spectroscopy with the archival HST data, it turns out that the lens is an
elliptical galaxy with M_V =-21.0, effective radius 2.8 kpc and stellar
velocity dispersion sigma=208+-39 km/sec. The source is a Lyman break galaxy
with Ly_alpha luminosity ~L* at that redshift. From the modeling of the system,
performed by assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) with external
shear, we estimate that the flux source is magnified about 4.5 times, and the
velocity dispersion of the lens is sigma_SIE=197.9-1.3+2.6 km/s, in good
agreement with the value derived spectroscopically. This is the second case
known of an Einstein cross of a Lyman-break galaxy.

of interest for biological applications (magnetic hyperthermia) as well as for
heterogeneous catalysis. This study shows why FeC NPs of similar structures and
static magnetic properties display radically different heating power (SAR from
0 to 2 kW.g-1). By combining results from Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and static and time-dependent
high-frequency magnetic measurements, we propose a model describing the heating
mechanism in FeC nanoparticles. Using, for the first time, time-dependent
high-frequency hysteresis loop measurements, it is shown that in the samples
displaying the larger heating powers, the hysteresis is strongly time
dependent. More precisely, the hysteresis area increases by a factor 10 on a
timescale of a few tens of seconds. This effect is directly related to the
ability of the nanoparticles to form chains under magnetic excitation, which
depends on the presence or not of strong dipolar couplings. These differences
are due to different ligand concentrations on the surface of the particles. As
a result, this study allows the design of a scalable synthesis of nanomaterials
displaying a controllable and reproducible SAR.

hydrogen in a diamond anvil cell in the pressure range $\sim 100 - 170

signatures of the transition are (i) a negative pressure-temperature slope,
(ii) a plateau in the heating curve, assumed to be related to the latent heat
of transformation, and (iii) an abrupt increase in the reflectance of the

account the position and time dependence of the heat deposited by the laser

to the phase transition, however we find that large values of latent heat are
needed and may indicate that dynamics at the transition are more complex than
considered in current models. Finally, experiments are proposed that can
distinguish between a change in optical properties due to a transition to a
metallic state or due to closure of the bandgap in molecular hydrogen.

in more versatile models that can be used for other classes of point processes

than other types of parsers. In this work, we address the following weaknesses
of such constituent parsers: (a) high error rates around closing brackets of
long constituents, (b) large label sets, leading to sparsity, and (c) error
propagation arising from greedy decoding. To effectively close brackets, we
train a model that learns to switch between tagging schemes. To reduce
sparsity, we decompose the label set and use multi-task learning to jointly
learn to predict sublabels. Finally, we mitigate issues from greedy decoding
through auxiliary losses and sentence-level fine-tuning with policy gradient.
Combining these techniques, we clearly surpass the performance of sequence
tagging constituent parsers on the English and Chinese Penn Treebanks, and
reduce their parsing time even further. On the SPMRL datasets, we observe even
greater improvements across the board, including a new state of the art on
Basque, Hebrew, Polish and Swedish.

polynomial time algorithm that transforms the instance of a given problem to an
equivalent instance of a size that is limited by a function of the parameter.
As, afterwards, this smaller instance can then be solved to find an answer to
the original question, kernelization is often presented as a form of
preprocessing. A natural generalization of kernelization is the process that
allows for a number of smaller instances to be produced to provide an answer to
the original problem, possibly also using negation. This generalization is
called Turing kernelization. Immediately, questions of equivalence occur or,
when is one form possible and not the other. These have been long standing open
problems in parameterized complexity. In the present paper, we answer many of
these. In particular, we show that Turing kernelizations differ not only from
regular kernelization, but also from intermediate forms as truth-table
kernelizations. We achieve absolute results by diagonalizations and also
results on natural problems depending on widely accepted complexity theoretic
assumptions. In particular, we improve on known lower bounds for the kernel
size of compositional problems using these assumptions.

and similar age as the Sun. It thus provides us a great opportunity to study
the properties of solar twins, as well as the evolution of Sun-like stars.
Aims. Previous spectroscopic studies reported to detect possible subtle changes
in stellar surface abundances throughout the stellar evolutionary phase, namely
the effect of atomic diffusion, in M67. In this study we attempt to confirm and
quantify more precisely the effect of atomic diffusion, as well as to explore
the level of chemical (in)homogeneity in M67. Methods. We presented a strictly
line-by-line differential chemical abundance analysis of two groups of stars in
M67: three turn-off stars and three sub-giants. Stellar atmospheric parameters
and elemental abundances were obtained with very high precision using the
Keck/HIRES spectra. Results. The sub-giants in our sample show negligible
abundance variations ($\le$ 0.02 dex), which implies that M67 was born
chemically homogeneous. We note there is a significant abundance difference
($\sim$ 0.1 - 0.2 dex) between sub-giants and turn-off stars, which can be
interpreted as the signature of atomic diffusion. Qualitatively stellar models
with diffusion agree with the observed abundance results. Some turn-off stars
do not follow the general pattern, which suggests that in some cases diffusion
can be inhibited, or they might suffered some sort of mixing event related to
planets. Conclusions. Our results pose additional challenges for chemical
tagging when using turn-off stars. In particular, the effects of atomic
diffusion, which could be as large as 0.1 - 0.2 dex, must be taken into account
in order for chemical tagging to be successfully applied.

Firstly, by constructing an intermediate attitude variable which involves

tracking problem. Secondly, the coordination relationships of relative
positions and headings are explored thoroughly for a group of non-holonomic
vehicles to maintain a mobile formation with rigid body motion constraints. We
prove that, except for the cases of parallel formation and translational
straight line formation, a mobile formation with strict rigid-body motion can
be achieved if and only if the ratios of linear speed to angular speed for each
individual vehicle are constants. Motion properties for mobile formation with
weak rigid-body motion are also demonstrated. Thereafter, based on the proposed
trajectory tracking approach, a distributed mobile formation control law is
designed under a directed tree graph. The performance of the proposed
controllers is validated by both numerical simulations and experiments.

in the presence of insoluble surface active agents. The surface active agents
not only cause gradients in surface tension, but could also render surface
viscosity to be significant, and variable, as a function of their
concentration. A set of three coupled nonlinear evolution equations are derived
for the film height, concentration of surface active agents, and the horizontal
liquid velocity which governs the dynamics of the free film. Suitable
phenomenological models for variation of surface tension and surface viscosity
with the concentration of surface active agents are incorporated in the
interfacial stress boundary condition. Linear stability analysis reveals the
effect of various non-dimensional parameters, specifically the retarding nature
of surface viscosity and Marangoni effects on film rupture. An analysis of the
`jamming' limit of surfactant concentration reveals that $\Gamma_0^{(nl)}<3
\mathbb{D}/M$ is a sufficient criteria for instability of the system, where
$\Gamma_0^{(nl)}$ is a normalized initial surface particle concentration,
$\mathbb{D}$ is the disjoining pressure number and $\textit{M}$ is the
Marangoni number. Nonlinear simulations suggest film profiles at rupture are
also qualitatively different from those reported in earlier studies, revealing
that free films in the jamming limit are remarkably stable and their free
surfaces behave like immobile interfaces. Furthermore, self-similar exponents
extracted from our nonlinear simulations are used to explain topological
differences between zero and constant surface viscosity in the vicinity of

based on the analog effective channel. And then the antenna partitioning
algorithm allocates each antenna element to RF chain according to the maximal

hybrid precoding is optimized for the dynamic subarray architecture. By
calculating SINRs on the analog effective channels of the selected users, the
antenna partitioning can greatly reduce computation complexity and the size of
the search space. Moreover, it also guarantees the user fairness since each
antenna element is allocated to acquire the maximal SINR increment of all
selected users. \textcolor{blue}{Extensive simulation results demonstrate that

  Yin","Towards Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-on Network","11 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Virtual try-on system under arbitrary human poses has huge application
potential, yet raises quite a lot of challenges, e.g. self-occlusions, heavy
misalignment among diverse poses, and diverse clothes textures. Existing
methods aim at fitting new clothes into a person can only transfer clothes on
the fixed human pose, but still show unsatisfactory performances which often
fail to preserve the identity, lose the texture details, and decrease the
diversity of poses. In this paper, we make the first attempt towards multi-pose
guided virtual try-on system, which enables transfer clothes on a person image
under diverse poses. Given an input person image, a desired clothes image, and
a desired pose, the proposed Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-on Network (MG-VTON)
can generate a new person image after fitting the desired clothes into the
input image and manipulating human poses. Our MG-VTON is constructed in three
stages: 1) a desired human parsing map of the target image is synthesized to
match both the desired pose and the desired clothes shape; 2) a deep Warping
Generative Adversarial Network (Warp-GAN) warps the desired clothes appearance
into the synthesized human parsing map and alleviates the misalignment problem
between the input human pose and desired human pose; 3) a refinement render
utilizing multi-pose composition masks recovers the texture details of clothes
and removes some artifacts. Extensive experiments on well-known datasets and
our newly collected largest virtual try-on benchmark demonstrate that our
MG-VTON significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods both
qualitatively and quantitatively with promising multi-pose virtual try-on
performances.

Valgrind. The tool measures the amount of memory that is actively being used by

measure the memory requirements of a process, the vast majority only focuses on
metrics like resident or proportional set sizes, which include memory that was
once claimed, but is momentarily disused. Consequently, such tools do not
permit drawing conclusions about how much cache or RAM a process actually
requires at each point in time, and thus cannot be used for performance
debugging. The few tools which do measure only actively used memory, however,
have limitations in temporal resolution and introspection. In contrast, our
tool offers an easy way to compute the memory that has recently been accessed
at any point in time, reflecting how cache and RAM requirements change over
time. In particular, this tool computes the set of memory references made
within a fixed time interval before any point in time, known as the working
set, and captures call stacks for interesting peaks in the working set size. We
first introduce the tool, then we run some examples comparing the output from
our tool with similar memory tools, and we close with a discussion of

diagrams and find rotational temperatures of $\sim 2500$ K and column densities
of $\sim 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ for both W Hya and R Dor. For W Hya, we observe
emission from vibrationally excited H2O arising from the same region as the OH

temperature derived for OH, we find a CO column density $\sim 15$ times higher

possibility of using OH lines observed in AGB stars to improve the accuracy of
the Hamiltonian used for the OH molecule. We predict stronger OH
lambda-doubling lines at millimetre wavelengths than those we detected. These
lines will be a good probe of shocked gas in the extended atmosphere and are
possibly even suitable as probes of the magnetic field in the atmospheres of

proposed by \citet{Fisher2017ApJ...839L...5F} in the context of the Violent
Disk Instability (VDI) theory. We here determine the clump sizes using a
recently presented 2-point estimator, which is robust against resolution/noise
effects, hierarchical clump substructure, clump-clump overlap and other
galactic substructure. After verifying Fisher's clump scaling relation for the
DYNAMO observations, we explore whether this relation remains characteristic of
the VDI theory, even if realistic physical processes, such as local asymetries
and stellar feedback, are included in the model. To this end, we rely on
hydrodynamic zoom-simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with four different
feedback prescriptions. We find that, during its marginally stable epoch at
$z=2$, this mock galaxy falls on the clump scaling relation, although its
position on this relation depends on the feedback model. This finding implies
that Toomre-like stability considerations approximately apply to large

irrespective of the feedback model, but also emphasizes that the global clump
distribution of a turbulent disk depends strongly on feedback.

model atmospheres and spectral synthesis code. We measured log(Be/H) = -14.3
from a spectrum synthesis of the region of the Be line. Using a conservative
approach, however we adopted an upper limit two times higher, i.e. log(Be/H) <
-14.0. We measured the O abundance from UV OH lines and find [O/H]=--3.46 after
a 3D correction. Our observation reinforces the existing upper limit on
primordial Be. There is no observational indication for a primordial production
of Be. This places strong constraints on the properties of putative relic
particles. This result also supports the hypothesis of a homogeneous Universe,
at the time of nucleosynthesis. Surprisingly, our upper limit of the Be
abundance is well below the Be measurements in stars of similar [O/H]. This may
be evidence that the Be-O relation breaks down in the early Galaxy, perhaps due

core cable (CORC) has high current carrying capacity for high field magnet and
power applications. In REBCO CORC cables, current redistribution occurs among
tapes through terminal contact resistances when a local quench occurs.
Therefore, the quench behaviour of CORC cable is different from single tape
situation, for it is significantly affected by terminal contact resistances. To
better understand the underlying physical process of local quenches in CORC
cables, a new 3D multi-physics modelling tool for CORC cables is developed and
presented in this paper. In this model, the REBCO tape is treated as a thin
shell without thickness, and four models are coupled: T-formulation model,
A-formulation model, a heat transfer model and an equivalent circuit model. The
current redistribution, temperature and tape voltage of CORC cable during hot
spot induced quenches are analysed using this model. The results show that the
thermal stability of CORC cable can be considerably improved by reducing
terminal contact resistance. The minimum quench energy (MQE) increases rapidly
with the reduction of terminal contact resistance when the resistance is in a
middle range. When the terminal contact resistance is too low or too high, the
MQE shows no obvious variation with terminal contact resistances. With a low
terminal contact resistance, a hot spot in one tape may induce an over-current
quench on the other tapes without hot spots. This will not happen in a cable
with high terminal contact resistance. In this case, the tape with hot spot
will quench and burn out before inducing a quench on other tapes. The modelling
tool developed can be used to design CORC cables with improved thermal
stability.

Different
from existing roadmap algorithms which first determine the free space and then
determine the collision-free path, researchers recently proposed several convex
relaxation based smoothing algorithms which first select an initial path to
link the starting configuration and the goal configuration and then reshape
this path to meet other requirements (e.g., collision-free conditions) by using
convex relaxation. However, convex relaxation based smoothing algorithms often
fail to give a satisfactory path, since the initial paths are selected
randomly. Moreover, the curvature constraints were not considered in the
existing convex relaxation based smoothing algorithms. In this paper, we show
that we can first grid the whole configuration space to pick a candidate path
and reshape this shortest path to meet our goal. This new algorithm inherits
the merits of the roadmap algorithms and the convex feasible set algorithm. We
further discuss how to meet the curvature constraints by using both the Beamlet
algorithm to select a better initial path and an iterative optimization
algorithm to adjust the curvature of the path. Theoretical analyzing and
numerical testing results show that it can almost surely find a feasible path
and use much less time than the recently proposed convex feasible set
algorithm.

However, present quantum sensing of microwave electric fields primarily relies

best sensitivity of atom-based electrometers is limited by photon shot noise to
few $\mu$Vcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$: While going beyond is in principle possible by
using squeezed light or Schr\""odinger-cat state, the former is very challenging

very favorable scalings on sensitivity gains. We can experimentally achieve a
sensitivity of $55$ nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$, with the minimum detectable field
being three orders of magnitude smaller than existing quantum electrometers. We
also measure phase and frequency, being able to reach a frequency accuracy of

Cash (BCH). Since then, miners have had a choice between BTC and BCH mining
because they have compatible proof-of-work algorithms. Therefore, they can
freely choose which coin to mine for higher profit, where the profitability
depends on both the coin price and mining difficulty. Some miners can
immediately switch the coin to mine only when mining difficulty changes because
the difficulty changes are more predictable than that for the coin price, and
we call this behavior fickle mining.
  In this paper, we study the effects of fickle mining by modeling a game
between two coins. To do this, we consider both fickle miners and some factions
(e.g., BITMAIN for BCH mining) that stick to mining one coin to maintain that
chain. In this model, we show that fickle mining leads to a Nash equilibrium in
which only a faction sticking to its coin mining remains as a loyal miner to
the less valued coin (e.g., BCH), where loyal miners refer to those who conduct
mining even after coin mining difficulty increases. This situation would cause
severe centralization, weakening the security of the coin system.
  To determine which equilibrium the competing coin systems (e.g., BTC vs. BCH)
are moving toward, we traced the historical changes of mining power for BTC and
BCH. In addition, we analyze the recent ""hash war"" between Bitcoin ABC and SV,
which confirms our theoretical analysis. Finally, we note that our results can
be applied to any competing cryptocurrency systems in which the same hardware
(e.g., ASICs or GPUs) can be used for mining. Therefore, our study brings new
and important angles in competitive coin markets: a coin can intentionally
weaken the security and decentralization level of the other rival coin when
mining hardware is shared between them, allowing for automatic mining.

biometric systems. Among them, Presentation Attacks (PAs, i.e., attempts to log
into the system with a fake biometric characteristic or presentation attack
instrument) pose a severe threat to the security of the system: any person
could eventually fabricate or order a gummy finger or face mask to impersonate
someone else. The biometrics community has thus made a considerable effort to
the development of automatic Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) mechanisms,
for instance through the international LivDet competitions.
  In this context, we present a novel fingerprint PAD scheme based on $i)$ a
new capture device able to acquire images within the short wave infrared (SWIR)
spectrum, and $ii)$ an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art techniques
based on both handcrafted and deep learning features. The approach is evaluated
on a database comprising over 4700 samples, stemming from 562 different
subjects and 35 different presentation attack instrument (PAI) species. The
results show the soundness of the proposed approach with a detection equal
error rate (D-EER) as low as 1.36\% even in a realistic scenario where five
different PAI species are considered only for testing purposes (i.e., unknown
attacks).

expectations of a linear functional of the solution of an elliptic PDE with

stated in terms of product-and-order-dependent (POD) weights. The (offline)
fast component-by-component (CBC) construction of an $N$-point QMC method
making use of these POD weights leads to a cost of $\mathcal{O}(s N \log(N) +
s^2 N)$ with $s$ the parameter truncation dimension. When $s$ is large this
cost is prohibitive. As an alternative Herrmann and Schwab introduced an
analysis resulting in product weights to reduce the construction cost to
$\mathcal{O}(s N \log(N))$. We here show how the reduced CBC method can be used
for POD weights to reduce the cost to $\mathcal{O}(\sum_{j=1}^{\min\{s,s^*\}}
(m-w_j+j) \, b^{m-w_j})$, where $N=b^m$ with prime $b$, $w_1 \le \cdots \le
w_s$ are nonnegative integers and $s^*$ can be chosen much smaller than $s$
depending on the regularity of the random field expansion as such making it
possible to use the POD weights directly. We show a total error estimate for
using randomly shifted lattice rules constructed through the reduced CBC
construction.

The proliferation of high di-mension and huge volume big data, however, has
brought major challenges, e.g. computation complexity and stability on noisy

neural network-based feature selection architecture, dubbed Attention-based
Feature Selec-tion (AFS). AFS consists of two detachable modules: an at-tention
module for feature weight generation and a learning module for the problem
modeling. The attention module for-mulates correlation problem among features
and supervision target into a binary classification problem, supported by a
shallow attention net for each feature. Feature weights are generated based on
the distribution of respective feature se-lection patterns adjusted by
backpropagation during the train-ing process. The detachable structure allows
existing off-the-shelf models to be directly reused, which allows for much less
training time, demands for the training data and requirements for expertise. A
hybrid initialization method is also intro-duced to boost the selection
accuracy for datasets without enough samples for feature weight generation.
Experimental results show that AFS achieves the best accuracy and stability in
comparison to several state-of-art feature selection algo-rithms upon both
MNIST, noisy MNIST and several datasets with small samples.

of learned representations and the ability of embedding knowledge about the
task at hand into the system. A common way to learn parameters of such models
consists in a multistage procedure where different combinations of components
are trained at different stages. The joint end-to-end training of the whole
system is then done as the last fine-tuning stage. This multistage approach is
time-consuming and cumbersome as it requires multiple runs until convergence
and multiple rounds of hyperparameter tuning. From this point of view, it is
beneficial to start the joint training procedure from the beginning. However,
such approaches often unexpectedly fail and deliver results worse than the
multistage ones. In this paper, we hypothesize that one reason for joint
training of deep energy-based models to fail is the incorrect relative
normalization of different components in the energy function. We propose online
and offline scaling algorithms that fix the joint training and demonstrate
their efficacy on three different tasks.

Previously, 3D shape instantiation frameworks for real-time 3D shape

network end is replaced with linear mapping for the regression task. The
derived 3D and the 2D marker references are used to instantiate
partially-deployed stent segment shape with the existing 3D shape instantiation

ratio), and density, we investigate which parameters most affect the rate at
which discs are dispersed due to external photoevaporation. We find that disc
dispersal due to external photoevaporation is faster in highly substructured
star-forming regions than in smooth and centrally concentrated regions.
Sub-virial star-forming regions undergoing collapse also show higher rates of
disc dispersal than regions that are in virial equilibrium or are expanding. In
moderately dense ($\sim$100 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$) regions, half of all
protoplanetary discs with radii $\geq$ 100 AU are photoevaporated within 1 Myr,
three times faster than is currently suggested by observational studies. Discs
in lower-density star-forming regions ($\sim$10 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$) survive
for longer, but half are still dispersed on short timescales ($\sim$2 Myr).
This demonstrates that the initial conditions of the star forming regions will
greatly impact the evolution and lifetime of protoplanetary discs. These
results also imply that either gas giant planet formation is extremely rapid
and occurs before the gas component of discs is evaporated, or gas giants only
form in low-density star-forming regions where no massive stars are present to

objects are induced by long range fluctuations of either classical or quantum

of physics, but such fluctuation induced forces arise in a wide range of
systems. Here we present a surprisingly never anticipated example of
fluctuation induced radiation forces, stemming from spatially long ranged
mesoscopic coherent fluctuations of light propagating in random media. Quite
remarkably, spatially coherent light fluctuations can be thoroughly described
by a hydrodynamic Langevin approach, where a properly tailored noise accounts
for mesoscopic coherent effects. The light flow depends on two parameters only,
the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the mobility $\sigma$, otherwise related by a
Einstein relation. The mapping we present between coherent light flow and out
of equilibrium hydrodynamics is easily generalisable to a large class of
quantum or classical wave problems. A clear asset of this type of approach is
in its dependence upon two parameters only thus making it a candidate to
efficient machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the strength of these coherent
fluctuating forces depends on a single and easily tunable dimensionless
conductance $g$ -- analog of electronic conductance -- which encapsulates both
the geometry and the scattering properties of the random medium. Hence coherent
multiple light scattering offers setups where fluctuation induced forces are
significantly enhanced compared to other known situations. The scarcity of

This often leaves some polymer residue on the graphene, which can strongly
impact its electronic, thermal, and mechanical resonance properties. To assess
the cleanliness of graphene fabrication methods, it is thus of considerable
interest to quantify the amount of contamination on top of the graphene. Here,
we present a methodology for direct measurement of the mass of the graphene
sheet using quartz crystal microbalances (QCM). By monitoring the QCM resonance
frequency during removal of graphene in an oxygen plasma, the total mass of the
graphene and contamination is determined with sub-graphene-monolayer accuracy.
Since the etch-rate of the contamination is higher than that of graphene,
quantitative measurements of the mass of contaminants below, on top, and
between graphene layers are obtained. We find that polymer-based dry transfer
methods can increase the mass of a graphene sheet by a factor of 10. The

classified into the realm of `beyond the rotating vector model' (RVM). It is
shown that these effects can be understood in geometrical terms, as a result of
coherent and quasi-coherent addition of elliptically polarized natural mode
waves. The coherent summation implies that the observed tracks of polarization
angle (PA) do not always correspond to the natural propagation mode (NPM)
waves. Instead, they are statistical average of coherent sum of the NPM waves,
and can be observed at any (and frequency-dependent) distance from the natural
modes. Therefore, the observed tracks of PA can wander arbitrarily far from the
RVM, and may be non-orthogonal. For equal amplitudes of the NPM waves two pairs
of orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs), displaced by 45 deg, can be observed,
depending on the width of lag distribution. Observed pulsar polarization mainly
results from two independent effects: the change of mode amplitude ratio and
the change of phase lag. In the core region both effects are superposed on each
other, which can produce so complex behaviour as observed in the cores of PSR
B1933+16, B1237+25 and J0437-4715. Change of the phase lag with frequency $\nu$
is mostly responsible for the observed strong evolution of these features with
$\nu$. The coherent addition of orthogonal natural waves is a useful
interpretive tool for the observed radio pulsar polarization.

can bias study results unless handled carefully. A double-sampling design
allocates additional resources to pursue a subsample of the dropouts and find
out their outcomes, which can address potential biases due to non-ignorable
dropout. It is desirable to construct semiparametric estimators for the
double-sampling design because of their robustness properties. However,
obtaining such semiparametric estimators remains a challenge due to the
requirement of the analytic form of the efficient influence function (EIF), the
derivation of which can be ad hoc and difficult for the double-sampling design.
Recent work has shown how the derivation of EIF can be made deductive and
computerizable using the functional derivative representation of the EIF in
nonparametric models. This approach, however, requires deriving the mixture of
a continuous distribution and a point mass, which can itself be challenging for
complicated problems such as the double-sampling design. We propose
semiparametric estimators for the survival probability in double-sampling
designs by generalizing the deductive and computerizable estimation approach.
In particular, we propose to build the semiparametric estimators based on a
discretized support structure, which approximates the possibly continuous
observed data distribution and circumvents the derivation of the mixture
distribution. Our approach is deductive in the sense that it is expected to
produce semiparametric locally efficient estimators within finite steps without
knowledge of the EIF. We apply the proposed estimators to estimating the
mortality rate in a double-sampling design component of the President's
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program. We evaluate the impact of
double-sampling selection criteria on the mortality rate estimates.

intense study in the last decade and many important problems like matrix
completion and blind deconvolution have been formulated in this framework. An
important benchmark method to solve these problems is to minimize the nuclear
norm, a convex proxy for the rank. A common approach to establish recovery
guarantees for this convex program relies on the construction of a so-called
approximate dual certificate. However, this approach provides only limited
insight in various respects. Most prominently, the noise bounds exhibit
seemingly suboptimal dimension factors. In this paper we take a novel, more
geometric viewpoint to analyze both the matrix completion and the blind
deconvolution scenario. We find that for both these applications the dimension
factors in the noise bounds are not an artifact of the proof, but the problems
are intrinsically badly conditioned. We show, however, that bad conditioning
only arises for very small noise levels: Under mild assumptions that include
many realistic noise levels we derive near-optimal error estimates for blind
deconvolution under adversarial noise.

from turn-by-turn (TbT) data containing measurement error is introduced. This
approach adopts a Bayesian inference based on the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm, which is widely used in data-driven discoveries. By assuming
a preset accelerator model with unknown parameters, the inference process
yields the their posterior distribution. This approach is demonstrated by
inferring the linear optics Twiss parameters and their measurement
uncertainties using a set of data measured at the National Synchrotron Light
Source-II (NSLS-II) storage ring. Some critical effects, such as radiation
damping rate, decoherence due to nonlinearity and chromaticity can also be
included in the model and inferred. These effects are usually ignored in
existing approaches. One advantage of the MCMC based Bayesian inference is that
it doesn't require a large data pool, thus a complete optics reconstruction can
be accomplished from a limited number of turns in a single data snapshot,
before a significant machine drift can happen. The precise reconstruction of

The Rosetta spacecraft made continuous measurements of the coma of
comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) for more than two years. The plasma in
the coma appeared very dynamic, and many factors control its variability. Aims.
We wish to identify the effects of solar flares on the comet plasma and also
their effect on the measurements by the Langmuir Probe Instrument (LAP).
Methods. To identify the effects of flares, we proceeded from an existing flare
catalog of Earth-directed solar flares, from which a new list was created that
only included Rosetta-directed flares. We also used measurements of flares at
Mars when at similar longitudes as Rosetta. The flare irradiance spectral model
(FISM v.1) and its Mars equivalent (FISM-M) produce an extreme-ultraviolet
(EUV) irradiance (10-120 nm) of the flares at 1 min resolution. LAP data and
density measurements obtained with the Mutual Impedence Probe (MIP) from the
time of arrival of the flares at Rosetta were examined to determine the flare
effects. Results. From the vantage point of Earth, 1504 flares directed toward
Rosetta occurred during the mission. In only 24 of these, that is, 1.6%, was
the increase in EUV irradiance large enough to cause an observable effect in
LAP data. Twenty-four Mars-directed flares were also observed in Rosetta data.
The effect of the flares was to increase the photoelectron current by typically
1-5 nA. We find little evidence that the solar flares increase the plasma
density, at least not above the background variability. Conclusions. Solar
flares have a small effect on the photoelectron current of the LAP instrument,
and they are not significant in comparison to other factors that control the
plasma density in the coma. The photoelectron current can only be used for
flare detection during periods of calm plasma conditions.

Poisson noise followed by additive Gaussian noise. While total variation and
related regularization methods for solving biomedical inverse problems are
known to yield high quality reconstructions, such methods mostly use
log-likelihood of either Gaussian or Poisson noise models, and rarely use mixed
Poisson-Gaussian (PG) noise model. There is a recent work which deals with
exact PG likelihood and totalariation regularization. This method is developed
using the log-likelihood of PG model along with total variation regularization
adapts the primal-dual splitting algorithm, whose step size is restricted to be
bounded by the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of PG log-likelihood. This
leads to limitations in the convergence speed. On the other hand, ADMM methods
do not have such step size restrictions; however, ADDM has never been applied
for this problem, for the possible reason that PG log-likelihood is quite
complex. In this paper, we develop an ADMM based optimization for total
variation minimizing image restoration under PG log-likelihood. We achieve this
by first developing a novel iterative method for computing the proximal
solution of PG log-likelihood, deriving the termination conditions for this
iterative method, and then integrating into a provable convergent ADMM scheme.
The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using restoration
examples.

ab initio method that incorporates the van der Waals interaction. The $^4$He
monolayer on GF and on hBN is studied by state-of-the-art quantum simulations
at T=0 K. With our adsorption potentials we find that in both cases the ground
state of $^4$He monolayer is a fluid and not an ordered state with localized
atoms as on graphite and on graphene. In the case of GF the present result is
in qualitative agreement with the superfluid phase that was obtained using an
empirical adsorption potential [M. Nava et al., Phys. Rev. B 86, 174509
(2012)]. This fluid state of $^4$He on GF and on hBN is characterized by a very
large density modulation and at the equilibrium density the ratio $\Gamma$
between the largest and the smallest local density along the direction of two
neighboring adsorption sites and averaged over the perpendicular direction is
$\Gamma$ = 1.91 for GF and $\Gamma$ = 1.65 for hBN. Recent experiments [J.
Nyeki et al., Nature Physics 13, 455 (2017)] have discovered a superfluid phase
in the second layer $^4$He. This is a spatially modulated superfluid that turns
out to have anomalous thermal properties. This gives a strong motivation for an
experimental study of monolayer $^4$He on GF and on hBN that we predict to be a
superfluid with a much stronger spatial modulation.

original distribution into a standard uniform distribution by means of the
probability integral transform. Since the original distribution is generally
unknown, the cumulative distribution function is approximated by computing the
q-quantiles of the training set; 2) construction of a Ruspini strong fuzzy

variety of medical image computing tasks. A common problem when applying
supervised deep learning methods to medical images is the lack of labeled data,

present a novel semi-supervised method for medical image segmentation, where
the network is optimized by the weighted combination of a common supervised
loss for labeled inputs only and a regularization loss for both labeled and
unlabeled data. To utilize the unlabeled data, our method encourages the
consistent predictions of the network-in-training for the same input under
different regularizations. Aiming for the semi-supervised segmentation problem,
we enhance the effect of regularization for pixel-level predictions by
introducing a transformation, including rotation and flipping, consistent
scheme in our self-ensembling model. With the aim of semi-supervised
segmentation tasks, we introduce a transformation consistent strategy in our
self-ensembling model to enhance the regularization effect for pixel-level

to entanglement between different degrees of freedom of a single beam. To
illustrate the aptitude of different types of correlated systems to act as

lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) for time-delay cosmography. This will
provide an independent and direct way for measuring the Hubble constant $H_0$,
which is necessary to address the current $4.4 \sigma$ tension in $H_0$ between
the local distance ladder and the early Universe measurements. We present a
detailed analysis of different observing strategies for the LSST, and quantify
their impact on time-delay measurement between multiple images of LSNe Ia. For
this, we produced microlensed mock-LSST light curves for which we estimated the
time delay between different images. We find that using only LSST data for
time-delay cosmography is not ideal. Instead, we advocate using LSST as a
discovery machine for LSNe Ia, enabling time delay measurements from follow-up
observations from other instruments in order to increase the number of systems
by a factor of 2 to 16 depending on the observing strategy. Furthermore, we
find that LSST observing strategies, which provide a good sampling frequency
(the mean inter-night gap is around two days) and high cumulative season length
(ten seasons with a season length of around 170 days per season), are favored.
Rolling cadences subdivide the survey and focus on different parts in different
years; these observing strategies trade the number of seasons for better
sampling frequency. In our investigation, this leads to half the number of
systems in comparison to the best observing strategy. Therefore rolling
cadences are disfavored because the gain from the increased sampling frequency
cannot compensate for the shortened cumulative season length. We anticipate
that the sample of lensed SNe Ia from our preferred LSST cadence strategies
with rapid follow-up observations would yield an independent percent-level
constraint on $H_0$.

the ppm-level is to use resistive high-voltage dividers. Such devices scale the
HV into a range where it can be compared with precision digital voltmeters to
reference voltages sources, which can be traced back to Josephson voltage
standards. So far the calibration of the scale factors of HV dividers for
voltages above 1~kV could only be done at metrology institutes and sometimes
involves round-robin tests among several institutions to get reliable results.
Here we present a novel absolute calibration method based on the measurement of
a differential scale factor, which can be performed with commercial equipment
and outside metrology institutes. We demonstrate that reproducible measurements
up to 35~kV can be performed with relative uncertainties below $1\cdot10^{-6}$.
This method is not restricted to metrology institutes and offers the
possibility to determine the linearity of high-voltage dividers for a wide
range of applications.

neural network (CNN) with LDR based learning is proposed. In conventional
inverse tone mapping with CNNs, generated HDR images cannot have absolute
luminance, although relative luminance can. Moreover, loss functions suitable
for learning HDR images are problematic, so it is difficult to train CNNs by
directly using HDR images. In contrast, the proposed method enables us not only
to estimate absolute luminance, but also to train a CNN by using LDR images.
The CNN used in the proposed method learns a transformation from various input
LDR images to LDR images mapped by Reinhard's global operator. Experimental
results show that HDR images generated by the proposed method have
higher-quality than HDR ones generated by conventional inverse tone mapping
methods,in terms of HDR-VDP-2.2 and PU encoding + MS-SSIM.

resembles identifying ones handwriting, it seems perfectly convenient to use
handwriting for the feature learning phase. The learned representation on the
more varied and plentiful handwriting dataset can compensate for the lack of

MC-SEFRON classifier. To develop a method to extract knowledge stored in a
trained classifier, first, the binary-class SEFRON classifier developed earlier
is extended to handle multi-class problems. MC-SEFRON uses the population
encoding scheme to encode the real-valued input data into spike patterns.
MC-SEFRON is trained using the same supervised learning rule used in the
SEFRON. After training, the proposed method extracts the knowledge for a given
class stored in the classifier by mapping the weighted postsynaptic potential
in the time domain to the feature domain as Feature Strength Functions (FSFs).
A set of FSFs corresponding to each output class represents the extracted
knowledge from the classifier. This knowledge encoding method is derived to
maintain consistency between the classification in the time domain and the
feature domain. The correctness of the FSF is quantitatively measured by using
FSF directly for classification tasks. For a given input, each FSF is sampled
at the input value to obtain the corresponding feature strength value (FSV).
Then the aggregated FSVs obtained for each class are used to determine the
output class labels during classification. FSVs are also used to interpret the
predictions during the classification task. Using ten UCI datasets and the
MNIST dataset, the knowledge extraction method, interpretation and the
reliability of the FSF are demonstrated. Based on the studies, it can be seen
that on an average, the difference in the classification accuracies using the
FSF directly and those obtained by MC-SEFRON is only around 0.9% & 0.1\% for
the UCI datasets and the MNIST dataset respectively. This clearly shows that
the knowledge represented by the FSFs has acceptable reliability and the
interpretability of classification using the classifier's knowledge has been
justified.
