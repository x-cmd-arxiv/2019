produced in an interferometer when the device is rotating. General relativistic
explanations are known and already widely explained in many papers. Such
general relativistic approaches are founded on Einstein's equivalence principle
(EEP), which states the equivalence between the gravitational ""force"" and the
pseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial frame of reference,
included a rotating observer. Typically, the authors consider the so-called
Langevin-Landau-Lifschitz metric and the path of light is determined by null
geodesics. This approach partially hides the physical meaning of the effect. It
seems indeed that the light speed varies by c\pm\omega r in one or the other
direction around the disk. In this paper, a slightly different general
relativistic approach will be used. The different ""gravitational field"" acting
on the beam splitter and on the two rays of light is analyzed. This different
approach permits a better understanding of the physical meaning of the Sagnac
effect.

$Ry^*$ is very close to the Rydberg energy scaled by the dielectric constant of
the medium surrounding the ML and by the reduced effective electron-hole mass,
whereas the ML polarizability is only accounted for by $\delta$. This is
justified by the analysis of experimental data on excitonic resonances, as
extracted from magneto-optical measurements of a high-quality WSe$_2$ ML
encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and well reproduced with an
analytically solvable Schr\""odinger equation when approximating the
electron-hole potential in the form of a modified Kratzer potential. Applying
our convention to other, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoS$_2$ MLs encapsulated in hBN, we
estimate an apparent magnitude of $\delta$ for each of the studied structures.
Intriguingly, $\delta$ is found to be close to zero for WSe$_2$ as well as for

Soret effect, ionic rearrangements towards a state of polarized ionic charge
density $q$ and local salt density $c$. For the case of equal cationic and
anionic diffusivities, we derive analytical approximations to $q, c$, and the
thermovoltage $V_{T}$ for early ($t\ll\tau_{T}$) and late ($t\gg\tau_{T}$)

challenge the conventional wisdom that the typically large Lewis number, the
ratio $a/D$ of thermal to ionic diffusivities, of most liquids implies a
quickly reached steady-state temperature profile onto which ions relax slowly.
Though true for the evolution of $c$, it turns out that $q$ (and $V_{T}$) can
respond much faster. Particularly when the cell is much bigger than the Debye

the $t\ll\tau_{T}$ regime, for which our approximated $q$ (corroborated by

component in computer simulation of physical systems and is a key enabler in
various analysis and design tasks related to uncertainty quantification.
Pertinent methods are severely inhibited by the high-dimension of the
parametric input and the limited number of training input/output pairs that can
be generated when computationally demanding forward models are considered. Such
cases are frequently encountered in the modeling of random heterogeneous media
where the scale of the microstructure necessitates the use of high-dimensional
random vectors and very fine discretizations of the governing equations. The
present paper proposes a probabilistic Machine Learning framework that is
capable of operating in the presence of Small Data by exploiting aspects of the
physical structure of the problem as well as contextual knowledge. As a result,
it can perform comparably well under extrapolative conditions. It unifies the
tasks of dimensionality and model-order reduction through an encoder-decoder
scheme that simultaneously identifies a sparse set of salient lower-dimensional
microstructural features and calibrates an inexpensive, coarse-grained model
which is predictive of the output. Information loss is accounted for and
quantified in the form of probabilistic predictive estimates. The learning
engine is based on Stochastic Variational Inference. We demonstrate how the
variational objectives can be used not only to train the coarse-grained model,
but also to suggest refinements that lead to improved predictions.

associated with X-class flares. The X9.3 flare on 6 September and the X8.2
flare on 10 September are currently the two largest during cycle 24. Both were
accompanied by fast coronal mass ejections and gave rise to solar energetic

partially-occulted solar event on 10 September triggered a ground level

SEP event was recorded on 4 September. In this work we analyze observations by
the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and the Geostationary Operational

out that the average puddle size sets the characteristic frequency cut-off in
the GHz range, across which the insulating dc behavior is separated from a

longitudinal axis of large 2.7 nm diameter tubes, more than 90 controlled

estimated. Molecular dynamics simulations show that even in 2 nm SWCNTs the
threshold energies for out-of-plane dynamics are different than in graphene,

(MPAs) as a biodiversity conservation instrument, nowadays MPA network design
frequently disregards the importance of connectivity patterns. In the case of
sedentary marine populations, connectivity stems not only from the stochastic
nature of the physical environment that affects early-life stages dispersal,
but also from the spawning stock attributes that affect the reproductive output
(e.g., passive eggs and larvae) and its survivorship. Early-life stages are
virtually impossible to track in the ocean. Therefore, numerical ocean current
simulations coupled to egg and larval Lagrangian transport models remain the
most common approach for the assessment of marine larval connectivity. Inferred
larval connectivity may be different depending on the type of connectivity
considered; consequently, the prioritisation of sites for marine populations'
conservation might also differ. Here, we introduce a framework for evaluating
and designing MPA networks based on the identification of connectivity hotspots
using graph theoretic analysis. We use as a case of study a network of
open-access areas and MPAs, off Mallorca Island (Spain), and test its
effectiveness for the protection of the painted comber Serranus scriba. Outputs
from network analysis are used to: (1) identify critical areas for improving
overall larval connectivity; (2) assess the impact of species' biological
parameters in network connectivity; and (3) explore alternative MPA
configurations to improve average network connectivity. Results demonstrate the
potential of graph theory to identify non-trivial egg/larval dispersal patterns
and emerging collective properties of the MPA network which are relevant for
increasing protection efficiency.

velocities of OB-associations in the Sagittarius, Perseus and Local System
stellar-gas complexes located within 3 kpc solar neighborhood. Ferrers
ellipsoids with density distribution defined by power indices n=1 and 2 are
considered. The success in the reproduction of the velocity in the Local System
is due to the large velocity dispersion which weakens the resonance effects by
producing smaller systematic motions. Model galaxies form nuclear, inner and
outer resonance rings R1 and R2. The outer rings R2 manage to catch twice more
particles than the rings R1. The outer Lindblad resonance of the bar (OLR) is
located 0.4 kpc beyond the solar circle, R_OLR=R0+0.4 kpc, corresponding to the
bar angular velocity of Omega_b=50 km s-1 kpc-1. The solar position angle with
respect to the bar, theta_b, providing the agreement between model and observed
velocities is 40-52 degrees. Unfortunately, models considered cannot reproduce
the residual velocities in the Carina and Cygnus stellar-gas complexes. The
redistribution of the specific angular momentum, L, is found near the Lindblad
resonances of the bar (ILR and OLR): the average value of L increases
(decreases) at the radii a bit smaller (larger) than those of the resonances
that can be connected with the existence of two types of periodic orbits
elongated perpendicular to each other there.

tremendous interests in developing RL-based recommender systems. In practical
recommendation sessions, users will sequentially access multiple scenarios,
such as the entrance pages and the item detail pages, and each scenario has its
specific characteristics. However, the majority of existing RL-based
recommender systems focus on optimizing one strategy for all scenarios or
separately optimizing each strategy, which could lead to sub-optimal overall
performance. In this paper, we study the recommendation problem with multiple
(consecutive) scenarios, i.e., whole-chain recommendations. We propose a
multi-agent RL-based approach (DeepChain), which can capture the sequential
correlation among different scenarios and jointly optimize multiple
recommendation strategies. To be specific, all recommender agents (RAs) share
the same memory of users' historical behaviors, and they work collaboratively
to maximize the overall reward of a session. Note that optimizing multiple
recommendation strategies jointly faces two challenges in the existing
model-free RL model - (i) it requires huge amounts of user behavior data, and
(ii) the distribution of reward (users' feedback) are extremely unbalanced. In
this paper, we introduce model-based RL techniques to reduce the training data
requirement and execute more accurate strategy updates. The experimental
results based on a real e-commerce platform demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework.

random clustered-wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with a three-tier hierarchy;
the sensor nodes (SNs), the cluster heads (CHs) and the fusion center (FC). The
CHs collect the SNs' local decisions and relay them to the FC that then fuses
them to reach the ultimate decision. The SN-CH and the CH-FC channels suffer
from additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In this context, we derive the
optimal log-likelihood ratio (LLR) fusion rule, which turns out to be
intractable. So, we develop a sub-optimal linear fusion rule (LFR) that weighs
the cluster's data according to both its local detection performance and the
quality of the communication channels. In order to implement it, we propose an
approximate maximum likelihood based LFR (LFR-aML), which estimates the
required parameters for the LFR. We also derive Gaussian-tail upper bounds for
the detection and false alarms probabilities for the LFR. Furthermore, an
optimal CH transmission power allocation strategy is developed by solving the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for the related optimization problem.
Extensive simulations show that the LFR attains a detection performance near to
that of the optimal LLR and confirms the validity of the proposed upper bounds.
Moreover, when compared to equal power allocation, simulations show that our
proposed power allocation strategy achieves a significant power saving at the
expense of a small reduction in the detection performance.

understanding of what is an ""insulator"", as they unveiled novel classes of
media that behave as metals near the surface, but are insulating in the bulk.
Here, we propose exact electromagnetic analogues of these two influential
models relying on a photonic crystal implementation of ""artificial graphene""
subject to an effective magnetic field. For the Haldane model, the required
effective magnetic field for photons can be emulated with a spatially variable
pseudo-Tellegen response. For the Kane-Mele model, the spin-orbit coupling can
be mimicked using matched anisotropic dielectrics with identical permittivity
and permeability, without requiring any form of bianisotropic couplings. Using
full wave numerical simulations and duality theory we verify that the
nontrivial topology of the two proposed platforms results in the emergence of
topologically protected gapless edge states at the interface with a trivial
photonic insulator. Our theory paves the way for the emulation of the two
condensed matter models in a photonic platform, and determines another paradigm
to observe topologically protected edges-states in a fully reciprocal
all-dielectric and non-uniform anisotropic metamaterial.

asynchronous shared memory model with n processes. We introduce the problem of
group election, a natural variant of leader election, and propose a framework
for the implementation of TAS objects from group election objects. We then
present two group election algorithms, each yielding an efficient TAS
implementation. The first implementation has expected max-step complexity
$O(\log^\ast k)$ in the location-oblivious adversary model, and the second has
expected max-step complexity $O(\log\log k)$ against any read/write-oblivious
adversary, where $k\leq n$ is the contention. These algorithms improve the
previous upper bound by Alistarh and Aspnes [2] of $O(\log\log n)$ expected
max-step complexity in the oblivious adversary model. We also propose a
modification to a TAS algorithm by Alistarh, Attiya, Gilbert, Giurgiu, and
Guerraoui [5] for the strong adaptive adversary, which improves its space
complexity from super-linear to linear, while maintaining its $O(\log n)$
expected max-step complexity. We then describe how this algorithm can be
combined with any randomized TAS algorithm that has expected max-step
complexity $T(n)$ in a weaker adversary model, so that the resulting algorithm
has $O(\log n)$ expected max-step complexity against any strong adaptive
adversary and $O(T(n))$ in the weaker adversary model. Finally, we prove that
for any randomized 2-process TAS algorithm, there exists a schedule determined
by an oblivious adversary such that with probability at least $(1/4)^t$ one of
the processes needs at least t steps to finish its TAS operation. This
complements a lower bound by Attiya and Censor-Hillel [7] on a similar problem
for $n\geq 3$ processes.

energy-efficient optical access network especially Ethernet Passive Optical
Network (EPON) which is one of the most widely accepted and deployed last-mile
access network. In this paper, our primary focus is on designing a protocol for
saving energy at Optical Network Units (ONUs) while satisfying the Service
Label Agreement (SLA). The SLA of both Up-Stream (US) and Down-Stream (DS)
traffic can be satisfied only if the EPON network can react to their
instantaneous load change during sleep periods of ONUs and to the best of our
knowledge, there doesn't exist any such proposal. Towards this target, we
propose a mechanism that allows the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) to force ONUs
to wake-up from sleep mode. Here, we demonstrate that if the OLT can distribute
the active ONUs (transceivers are active) fairly among cycles then it provides
a significant improvement in energy-efficiency. To achieve this, we formulate
an ILP for fairly distributing active ONUs among cycles while satisfying the
SLA of both US and DS traffic at the same time. A polynomial time
$1$-approximation algorithm is proposed for solving this ILP. The convergence
and the complexity analysis of the algorithm are also performed. Extensive
simulations depict that fair distribution of ONUs reduces the power consumption
and average delay figure at the same time and the reduction increases with an
increment of the number of ONUs and round-trip time.

an $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo wave nor an advection-dominated dynamo are able to
explain the cycle period and the propagation direction of the mean magnetic

larger than the $\Omega$ effect in generating the toroidal magnetic field, and
therefore, the dynamo seems to be $\alpha^2\Omega$ or $\alpha^2$ type. We
further find that the effective large-scale flows are significantly altered by

is indispensable for studies of geometrically frustrated artificial spin
systems and low-energy nanomagnetic computation. Currently-used heating schemes
based on contact to a thermal reservoir, however, lack the speed and spatial
selectivity required for the implementation in technological applications.
Applying a hybrid approach by combining a plasmonic nanoheater with a magnetic
element, in this work we establish the robust and reliable control of local
temperatures in nanomagnetic arrays by contactless optical means.
Plasmon-assisted photo-heating allows for temperature increases of up to
several hundred Kelvins, which lead to thermally-activated moment reversals and
a pronounced reduction of the magnetic coercive field. Furthermore, the
polarization-dependent absorption cross section of elongated plasmonic elements
enables sublattice-specific heating on sub-nanosecond time scales. Using
optical degrees of freedom, i.e. focal position, polarization, power, and pulse
length, thermoplasmonic heating of nanomagnets offers itself for the use in
flexible, fast, spatially-, and element-selective thermalization for functional
magnetic metamaterials.

computation (UQC). It was introduced to show that UQC can be realized via
quantum teleportation, given access to certain standard resources. While the
full structure of the hierarchy is still not understood, Cui et al.
(arXiv:1608.06596) recently described the structure of diagonal unitaries in
the hierarchy. They considered diagonal gates whose action on a computational
basis qudit state is described by a $2^k$-th root of unity raised to a
polynomial function of the state, and they established the level of such
unitaries in the hierarchy. For qubit systems, we consider $k$-th level
diagonal gates that can be described just by quadratic forms of the state over
the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ of integers mod $2^k$. These involve symmetric
matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ that can be used to efficiently describe all
$2$-local and certain higher locality diagonal gates in the hierarchy. We also
provide explicit algebraic descriptions of their action on Pauli matrices,
which establishes a natural recursion to diagonal gates from lower levels. This
involves symplectic matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ and hence our perspective
unifies these gates with the binary symplectic framework for Clifford gates. We
augment our description with simple examples for certain standard gates. In
addition to demonstrating structure, these formulas might prove useful in
applications such as (i) classical simulation of quantum circuits, especially
via the stabilizer rank approach, (ii) synthesis of logical non-Clifford
unitaries, specifically alternatives to magic state distillation, and (iii)
decomposition of arbitrary unitaries beyond the Clifford+$T$ set of gates,
perhaps leading to shorter depth circuits. Our results suggest that some
non-diagonal gates might be understood by generalizing other binary symplectic
matrices to integer rings.

planets remains insufficiently constrained, and it is not clear whether the
solar system is a statistical outlier or can be explained by more general
planetary formation processes. Here we employ numerical models of planet
formation, evolution, and interior structure, to show that a planet's bulk

the planetesimal-based accretion framework. The heat generated by this
short-lived radionuclide rapidly dehydrates planetesimals prior to accretion
onto larger protoplanets and yields a system-wide correlation of planet bulk
abundances, which, for instance, can explain the lack of a clear orbital trend
in the water budgets of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. Qualitatively, our models
suggest two main scenarios of planetary systems' formation: high-$^{26}$Al
systems, like our solar system, form small, water-depleted planets, whereas
those devoid of $^{26}$Al predominantly form ocean worlds, where the mean
planet radii between both scenarios deviate by up to about 10%.

hyperbolic three-space. As a step toward a generalization for unbounded convex
subsets, we consider convex regions of hyperbolic three-space bounded by two
properly embedded disks which meet at infinity along a Jordan curve in the
ideal boundary. In this setting, it is natural to augment the notion of induced
metric on the boundary of the convex set to include a gluing map at infinity
which records how the asymptotic geometry of the two surfaces compares near
points of the limiting Jordan curve. Restricting further to the case in which
the induced metrics on the two bounding surfaces have constant curvature $K \in
[-1,0)$ and the Jordan curve at infinity is a quasicircle, the gluing map is
naturally a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the circle. The main result is that
for each value of $K$, every quasisymmetric map is achieved as the gluing map
at infinity along some quasicircle. We also prove analogous results in the
setting of three-dimensional anti de Sitter geometry. Our results may be viewed
as universal versions of the conjectures of Thurston and Mess about prescribing
the induced metric on the boundary of the convex core of quasifuchsian
hyperbolic manifolds and globally hyperbolic anti de Sitter spacetimes.

ability to combine the datasets. This interpretation is prior-dependent, with
wider prior widths boosting the confidence. We therefore propose that if there
are any reasonable priors which reduce the confidence to below unity, then we
cannot assert that the datasets are compatible. Computing the evidence ratios
for the DES first year analysis and Planck, given that narrower priors drop the
confidence to below unity, we conclude that DES and Planck are, in a Bayesian
sense, incompatible under LCDM. Additionally we compute ratios which confirm
the consensus that measurements of the acoustic scale by the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS) are compatible with Planck, whilst direct
measurements of the acceleration rate of the Universe by the SHOES
collaboration are not. We propose a modification to the Bayes ratio which
removes the prior dependency using Kullback-Leibler divergences, and using this
statistical test find Planck in strong tension with SHOES, in moderate tension
with DES, and in no tension with SDSS. We propose this statistic as the optimal
way to compare datasets, ahead of the next DES data releases, as well as future
surveys. Finally, as an element of these calculations, we introduce in a
cosmological setting the Bayesian model dimensionality, which is a
parameterisation-independent measure of the number of parameters that a given

method, called Face-SSD, for detecting faces and for performing various
face-related (classification/regression) tasks including smile recognition,
face attribute prediction and valence-arousal estimation in the wild. Face-SSD
uses a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) to detect multiple faces of
different sizes and recognise/regress one or more face-related classes.
Face-SSD has two parallel branches that share the same low-level filters, one
branch dealing with face detection and the other one with face analysis tasks.
The outputs of both branches are spatially aligned heatmaps that are produced
in parallel - therefore Face-SSD does not require that face detection, facial
region extraction, size normalisation, and facial region processing are
performed in subsequent steps. Our contributions are threefold: 1) Face-SSD is
the first network to perform face analysis without relying on pre-processing
such as face detection and registration in advance - Face-SSD is a simple and a
single FCNN architecture simultaneously performing face detection and
face-related task analysis - those are conventionally treated as separate
consecutive tasks; 2) Face-SSD is a generalised architecture that is applicable
for various face analysis tasks without modifying the network structure - this
is in contrast to designing task-specific architectures; and 3) Face-SSD
achieves real-time performance (21 FPS) even when detecting multiple faces and
recognising multiple classes in a given image. Experimental results show that
Face-SSD achieves state-of-the-art performance in various face analysis tasks
by reaching a recognition accuracy of 95.76% for smile detection, 90.29% for
attribute prediction, and Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 0.44 and 0.39 for
valence and arousal estimation.

become a highly active area of research. A particularly challenging class of
problems in this area is partially observable, cooperative, multi-agent
learning, in which teams of agents must learn to coordinate their behaviour
while conditioning only on their private observations. This is an attractive
research area since such problems are relevant to a large number of real-world
systems and are also more amenable to evaluation than general-sum problems.
Standardised environments such as the ALE and MuJoCo have allowed single-agent
RL to move beyond toy domains, such as grid worlds. However, there is no
comparable benchmark for cooperative multi-agent RL. As a result, most papers
in this field use one-off toy problems, making it difficult to measure real
progress. In this paper, we propose the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)
as a benchmark problem to fill this gap. SMAC is based on the popular real-time
strategy game StarCraft II and focuses on micromanagement challenges where each
unit is controlled by an independent agent that must act based on local
observations. We offer a diverse set of challenge maps and recommendations for
best practices in benchmarking and evaluations. We also open-source a deep
multi-agent RL learning framework including state-of-the-art algorithms. We
believe that SMAC can provide a standard benchmark environment for years to
come. Videos of our best agents for several SMAC scenarios are available at:

in MCMC caps the potential advantages of neural networks in two ways: (i) Its
intrinsic computational cost sets stringent practical limits on the width and
depth of the networks, and therefore limits their expressive capacity; (ii) Its
difficulty in generating precise and uncorrelated samples can result in
estimations of observables that are very far from their true value. Inspired by
the state-of-the-art generative models used in machine learning, we propose a
specialized Neural Network architecture that supports efficient and exact

demonstrate our approach for two-dimensional interacting spin models,

the heavy mass loss of these cool luminous giants, as they provide radiative
acceleration for the stellar winds. Characteristic mid-IR spectral features
indicate that the grains consist mainly of silicates and corundum. The latter
species seems to form in a narrow zone within about 2 stellar radii, preceding
the condensation of silicate dust, which triggers the outflow. Recent
high-angular-resolution observations show clumpy, variable dust clouds at these
distances. We explore possible causes for the formation of inhomogeneous dust
layers, using 3D dynamical simulations. We modeled the outer convective
envelope and the dust-forming atmosphere of an M-type AGB star with the CO5BOLD
radiation-hydrodynamics code. The simulations account for frequency-dependent
gas opacities, and include a time-dependent description of grain growth and
evaporation for corundum and olivine-type silicates. In the inner,
gravitationally bound, and corundum-dominated layers of the circumstellar
envelope, a patchy distribution of the dust emerges naturally, due to
atmospheric shock waves that are generated by large-scale convective flows and
pulsations. The formation of silicate dust at somewhat larger distances
probably indicates the outer limit of the gravitationally bound layers. The
current models do not describe wind acceleration, but the cloud formation
mechanism should also work for stars with outflows. Timescales of atmospheric
dynamics and grain growth are similar to observed values. In spherical averages
of dust densities the variable 3D morphology manifests itself as cycle-to-cycle
variations. Grain growth in the wake of large-scale non-spherical shock waves,
generated by convection and pulsations, is a likely mechanism for producing the
observed clumpy dust clouds, and for explaining their physical and dynamical
properties.

RMS inclinations of 8.9$^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$ and 1.1$^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ degrees. We
also report that an axisymmetric belt model provides a good fit to new and

sufficient dynamical heating to explain the hot population throughout the

alone cannot reproduce the two populations observed. This argues for an
alternative or additional scenario, such as planetesimals being born with high

(ii) estimation of cosmological parameter from Cosmic Microwave Background

four convolutional+pooling layers, and have used it for all the applications

accuracy of about 95%, comparable with other existing spherical CNNs. For CMB
applications, we have tested the CNN on the estimation of a ""mock"" parameter,
defining the angular scale at which the power spectrum of a Gaussian field
projected on the sphere peaks. We have estimated this parameter directly from
maps, in several cases: temperature and polarization, presence of noise and
partial sky coverage. In all the cases, the NN performances are comparable with
those from standard spectrum-based bayesian methods. We demonstrate, for the
first time, the capability of CNNs to extract information from polarization
fields and to distinguish between E and B-modes. Lastly, we have applied our
CNN to the estimation of the Thomson scattering optical depth at reionization

lines of the atomic doublet of CIV, with a separation of $\approx 497\,{\rm
km\,s^{-1}}$, as well as those of other species appear well resolved in most of
our composites. This agrees with broad outflow troughs consisting in the
superposition of narrow absorbers. We also report on the ubiquitous detection
of the radiative-acceleration signature known as line locking in all our
composite outflow spectra, including one spectrum strictly built from broad
absorption line (BAL) systems. This is the first line-locking detection in BAL
composite spectra. Line locking is driven by the CIV atomic doublet, and is
visible on the blue side of most strong absorption transitions. Similar effects
from the doublets of OVI, SiIV, or NV, however, seem to not be present. Our
results confirm that radiation pressure is a prevalent mechanism for
accelerating outflows in quasars.

possess strong UV activity, which may effectively photolyze stratospheric H2O.
Prior modeling efforts have not included the impact of high stellar UV activity
on the H2O. Here, we employ a 1-D photochemical model with varied stellar UV,
to assess whether H2O destruction driven by high stellar UV would affect its
detectability in transmission spectroscopy. Temperature and water vapor
profiles are taken from published 3-D climate model simulations for an IHZ
Earth-sized planet around a 3300 K M dwarf with an N2-H2O atmosphere; they
serve as self-consistent input profiles for the 1-D model. We explore
additional chemical complexity within the 1-D model by introducing other
species into the atmosphere. We find that as long as the atmosphere is
well-mixed up to 1 mbar, UV activity appears to not impact detectability of H2O
in the transmission spectrum. The strongest H2O features occur in the JWST MIRI

characterize the companion for the first time. We observed R CrA twice with the
NaCo instrument at VLT in the $L'$ filter with a one year time baseline in
between. The high-contrast imaging data were reduced and analyzed, and in both

separation of $196.8\pm4.5$/$196.6\pm5.9$ mas ($18.7\pm1.3$/$18.7\pm1.4$ AU)

of the signal being a background object. The companion candidate orbits in the
clockwise direction and, if on a face-on circular orbit, its period is
$\sim43-47$ yr. This value disagrees with the estimated orbital motion and
therefore a face-on circular orbit may be excluded. Depending on the assumed
age, extinction and brightness of the primary, the stellar companion has a mass
between $0.10\pm0.02\, M_\odot$ and $1.03^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\,M_\odot$ range, if
no contribution from circumsecondary material is taken into account. The
presence of the companion needs to be taken into account when analyzing the

frequencies cannot be fit within the uncertainties of the CoRoT data by models
without atomic diffusion.
  Irrespective of this limitation, the low-order gravity modes reveal HD 170580

hint of small differential rotation. Future Gaia DR3 data taking into account
the multiplicity of the star, along with long-term TESS photometry would allow

observations indicate that they are surrounded by circumplanetary material or
even a circumplanetary disk. We want to investigate if the gas component of
disks around wide-orbit companions is detectable with current and future
(sub)mm telescopes and what constraints such gas observations can provide on
the nature of the circumplanetary material and on the mass of the companion. We
applied the radiation thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo to model the dust and
gas component of passive circumplanetary disks and produced realistic synthetic
observables. We considered different companion properties, disk parameters and
radiative environments and compared the resulting synthetic observables to
telescope sensitivities and to existing dust observations. The main criterion
for a successful detection is the size of the circumplanetary disk. At a
distance of about 150 pc, a circumplanetary disk with an outer radius of about
10 au is detectable with ALMA in about 6 hours in optically thick CO lines.
Other aspects such as the companion's luminosity, disk inclination and
background radiation fields are also relevant and should be considered to
optimize the observing strategy for detection experiments. For most of the
known wide-orbit planet-mass companions, their maximum theoretical disk size of
one third of the Hill radius would be sufficient to allow detection of CO
lines. It is therefore feasible to detect their gas disks and constrain the
mass of the companion through the kinematic signature. Even in the case of
non-detections such observations will provide stringent constraints on disk
size and gas mass, information crucial for formation theories.

prediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour

helps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a

consists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square
Error loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for
the task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for

algebraic and differential topology of manifolds and related studies were
started by Thom etc.. Cobordisms of Morse functions were introduced and have
been studied as a branch of the algebraic and differential topological theory
of Morse functions and their higher dimensional versions, or the global
singularity theory, by Kalm\'{a}r, Ikegami, Sadykov, Saeki, Wrazidlo, Yamamoto
etc. since 2000s.
  Cobordism relations are in most cases defined as the following for example;
two closed manifolds of a fixed dimension or maps on them into a fixed space
are said to be {\it cobordant} if the disjoint union is a boundary of a compact
manifold or the restriction of a map satisfying suitable conditions on the
manifold into the product of the target space and the closed interval. Such
relations induce structures of modules consisting of all obtained equivalence
classes such that the sums are defined by procedures of taking disjoint unions
and in the cases of manifolds, ring structures such that the products are
defined by the procedures of taking products, are also introduced.
  In this paper, as a new algebraic topological study, we try to define a
product of two cobordism classes of Morse functions and show that a natural
method fails, by presenting explicit examples which are regarded as an
obstruction.

inside a star is destroyed as the star becomes a red giant. However,
observations reveal that about 1% of red giants are peculiarly rich in lithium,
often exceeding the amount in the interstellar medium or predicted from the Big
Bang. With only about 150 lithium-rich giants discovered in the past four
decades, and no distinguishing properties other than lithium enhancement, the
origin of lithium-rich giant stars is one of the oldest problems in stellar
astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of 2,330 low-mass (1 to
3$\,M_\odot$) lithium-rich giant stars, which we argue are consistent with
internal lithium production that is driven by tidal spin-up by a binary
companion. Our sample reveals that most lithium-rich giants have helium-burning
cores ($80^{+7}_{-6}\%$), and that the frequency of lithium-rich giants rises
with increasing stellar metallicity. We find that while planet accretion may
explain some lithium-rich giants, it cannot account for the majority that have
helium-burning cores. We rule out most other proposed explanations as the
primary mechanism for lithium-rich giants, including all stages related to
single star evolution. Our analysis shows that giants remain lithium-rich for
only about two million years. A prediction from this lithium depletion
timescale is that most lithium-rich giants with a helium-burning core have a
binary companion.

networks are learning a perturbation from identity. Residual networks are
enormously important deep learning models, with many theories attempting to
explain how they function; learning a perturbation from identity is one such
theory. In order to answer this question, the magnitudes of the perturbations
are measured in both an absolute sense as well as in a scaled sense, with each
form having its relative benefits and drawbacks. Additionally, a stopping rule
is developed that can be used to decide the depth of the residual network based
on the average perturbation magnitude being less than a given epsilon. With
this analysis a better understanding of how residual networks process and
transform data from input to output is formed. Parallel experiments are
conducted on MNIST as well as CIFAR10 for various sized residual networks with
between 6 and 300 residual blocks. It is found that, in this setting, the
average scaled perturbation magnitude is roughly inversely proportional to
increasing the number of residual blocks, and from this it follows that for
sufficiently large residual networks, they are learning a perturbation from
identity.

  Models",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Expectation-Maximization (EM) is a prominent approach for parameter
estimation of hidden (aka latent) variable models. Given the full batch of
data, EM forms an upper-bound of the negative log-likelihood of the model at
each iteration and updates to the minimizer of this upper-bound. We first
provide a ""model level"" interpretation of the EM upper-bound as sum of relative
entropy divergences to a set of singleton models, induced by the set of
observations. Our alternative motivation unifies the ""observation level"" and
the ""model level"" view of the EM. As a result, we formulate an online version
of the EM algorithm by adding an analogous inertia term which corresponds to
the relative entropy divergence to the old model. Our motivation is more widely
applicable than the previous approaches and leads to simple online updates for
mixture of exponential distributions, hidden Markov models, and the first known
online update for Kalman filters. Additionally, the finite sample form of the
inertia term lets us derive online updates when there is no closed-form
solution. Finally, we extend the analysis to the distributed setting where we
motivate a systematic way of combining multiple hidden variable models.
Experimentally, we validate the results on synthetic as well as real-world

about information-flow security policies. In this paper, we investigate the
problem of statistical model checking (SMC) for hyperproperties. Unlike
exhaustive model checking, SMC works based on drawing samples from the system
at hand and evaluate the specification with statistical confidence. The main
benefit of applying SMC over exhaustive techniques is its efficiency and
scalability. To reason about probabilistic hyperproperties, we first propose
the temporal logic HyperPCLT* that extends PCTL* and HyperPCTL. We show that
HyperPCLT* can express important probabilistic information-flow security
policies that cannot be expressed with HyperPCTL. Then, we introduce SMC
algorithms for verifying HyperPCLT* formulas on discrete-time Markov chains,
based on sequential probability ratio tests (SPRT) with a new notion of
multi-dimensional indifference region. Our SMC algorithms can handle both
non-nested and nested probability operators for any desired significance level.
To show the effectiveness of our technique, we evaluate our SMC algorithms on
four case studies focused on information security: timing side-channel
vulnerability in encryption, probabilistic anonymity in dining cryptographers,
probabilistic noninterference of parallel programs, and the performance of a
randomized cache replacement policy that acts as a countermeasure against cache
flush attacks.

of correlators that alleviate these issues. Each such Bell inequality is
associated with a unique coordination game. In the simplest case, Alice and
Bob, each having two random variables, attempt to maximize the area of a
rectangle and the rectangle's area is represented by a certain parameter. This
parameter, which is a function of the correlations between their random
variables, is shown to be a Bell parameter, i.e. the achievable bound using
only classical correlations is strictly smaller than the achievable bound using
non-local quantum correlations We continue by generalizing to the case in which
Alice and Bob, each having now n random variables, wish to maximize a certain
volume in n-dimensional space. We term this parameter a multiplicative Bell
parameter and prove its Tsirelson bound. Finally, we investigate the case of
local hidden variables and show that for any deterministic strategy of one of
the players the Bell parameter is a harmonic function whose maximum approaches
the Tsirelson bound as the number of measurement devices increases. Some
theoretical and experimental implications of these results are discussed.

pressing an ionic liquid (IL) based polymer electrolyte membrane between two
CNT fiber sheet electrodes at room temperature, and laminating with ordinary
plastic film. This fabrication method is demonstrated by assembling large area
devices of up to 100 cm2 with electrodes fabricated in-house, as well as with
commercial CNT fiber sheets. Free-standing flexible devices operating at 3.5 V
exhibited 28 F g-1 of specific capacitance, 11.4 Wh kg-1 of energy density and
46 kW kg-1 of power density. These values are nearly identical to control
samples with pure ionic liquid. The solid EDLC could be repeatedly bent and
folded 180{\deg} without degradation of their properties, with a reversible 25%
increase in energy density in the bent state. Devices produced using CNT fiber
electrodes with a higher degree of orientation and therefore better mechanical
properties showed similar electrochemical properties combined with composite
specific strength and modulus of 39 MPa/SG and 577 MPa/SG for a fiber mass
fraction of 11 wt.%, similar to a structural thermoplastic and with higher
specific strength than copper.

triggers at an acceptable level these triggers have to be highly selective,

curves. The muon systems of the LHC experiments and experiments at future
colliders like FCC-hh will use two muon chamber systems for the muon trigger,
fast trigger chambers like RPCs with coarse spatial resolution and much slower
precision chambers like drift-tube chambers with high spatial resolution. The
data of the trigger chambers are used to identify the bunch crossing in which
the muon was created and for a rough momentum measurement while the precise
measurements of the muon trajectory by the precision chambers are ideal for an
accurate muon momentum measurement. A compact muon track finding algorithm is

highly oversamples the video signal (as compared with the pixel rate) to
reconstruct pixel values for different CDS timings using identical raw video

that exploits the fact that an RDF Knowledge Base (KB), is a graph (or
equivalently a set of triples), and thus it has not a unique serialization (as
it happens with text). If we want to keep stored several versions we actually
want to store multiple sets of triples. CPOI is a data structure for storing
such sets aiming at reducing the storage space since this is important not only
for reducing storage costs, but also for reducing the various communication
costs and enabling hosting in main memory (and thus processing efficiently)
large quantities of data. CPOI is based on a partial order structure over sets
of triple identifiers, where the triple identifiers are represented in a gapped
form using variable length encoding schemes. For this index we evaluate
analytically and experimentally various identifier assignment techniques and
their space savings. The results show significant storage savings,
specifically, the storage space of the compressed sets in large and realistic
synthetic datasets is about the 8% of the size of the uncompressed sets.

  the Efficiency of Attribute Guided Facial Image Retrieval","To be published in Proc. IEEE Global SIP 2018",,,,"cs.CV cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With benefits of fast query speed and low storage cost, hashing-based image
retrieval approaches have garnered considerable attention from the research
community. In this paper, we propose a novel Error-Corrected Deep Cross Modal
Hashing (CMH-ECC) method which uses a bitmap specifying the presence of certain
facial attributes as an input query to retrieve relevant face images from the
database. In this architecture, we generate compact hash codes using an
end-to-end deep learning module, which effectively captures the inherent
relationships between the face and attribute modality. We also integrate our
deep learning module with forward error correction codes to further reduce the
distance between different modalities of the same subject. Specifically, the
properties of deep hashing and forward error correction codes are exploited to
design a cross modal hashing framework with high retrieval performance.
Experimental results using two standard datasets with facial attributes-image
modalities indicate that our CMH-ECC face image retrieval model outperforms
most of the current attribute-based face image retrieval approaches.

the growth of both traffic volumes and the number of flows. Also, swiftness of

accurate working set of active flows (WSAF) from massive volumes of packet
influxes at line rates is a key challenge. WSAF is usually located in a very
fast but expensive memory, such as TCAM or SRAM, and thus the number of entries
to be stored is quite limited. To cope with the scalability issue of WSAF, we
propose to use In-DRAM WSAF with scales, and put a compact data structure
called FlowRegulator in front of WSAF to compensate for DRAM's slow access time
by substantially reducing massive influxes to WSAF without compromising
measurement accuracy. We prototype and evaluated our system in a large scale

we specifically explore the potential of generative modeling, using Generative

analytic pipeline which first generates synthetic retinal images from clinical

merge GANs (DCGANs and WGANs architectures) and style transferring for the
image generation, whereas the verified step controls the accuracy of the
generated images. We find that the generated images contain sufficient
pathological details to facilitate ophthalmologists' task of disease
classification and in discovery of disease relevant features. In particular,
our system predicts the drusen and geographic atrophy sub-classes of AMD.
Furthermore, the performance using CFP images for GANs outperforms the
classification based on using only the original clinical dataset. Our results
are evaluated using existing classifier of retinal diseases and class activated

inflated radii, which has been attributed to poorly understood magnetic
activity effects. Despite a long history of magnetic activity studies of this

present a comprehensive characterisation of the surface magnetic field in both

help of a tomographic inversion technique applied to high-resolution

positive entropy subshifts satisfying the assertion of Sarnak's conjecture.
More precisely, it is proved that if $y=(y_n)_{n\ge 1}$ is a bounded sequence
with zero average along every infinite arithmetic progression (the M\""obius
function is an example of such a \sq\ $y$) then for every $N\ge 2$ there exists
a subshift $\Sigma$ over $N$ symbols, with entropy arbitrarily close to $\log
N$, uncorrelated to $y$.
  In the present note, we improve the result of (DS). First of all, we observe
that the uncorrelation obtained in (DS) is \emph{uniform}, i.e., for any
continuous function $f:\Sigma\to {\mathbb R}$ and every $\epsilon>0$ there
exists $n_0$ such that for any $n\ge n_0$ and any $x\in\Sigma$ we have $$
\left|\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(T^ix)\,y_i\right|<\epsilon. $$ More importantly,
by a fine-tuned modification of the construction from (DS) we create a
\emph{strictly ergodic} subshift, with all the desired properties of the
example in (DS) (uniformly uncorrelated to $y$ and with entropy arbitrarily
close to $\log N$).
  The question about these two additional properties (uniformity of
uncorrelation and strict ergodicity) has been posed by Mariusz Lemanczyk in the
context of the so-called strong MOMO (M\""obius Orthogonality on Moving Orbits)
property. Our result shows, among other things, that strong MOMO is essentially
stronger than uniform uncorrelation, even for strictly ergodic systems.

1200 days. The host galaxy is a quiescent early type galaxy at $z$ = 0.0899
with a blackhole mass of $2\times10^7M_\odot$. The transient underwent a 2.5
magnitude brightening over $\sim120$ days, reaching a peak $V$-band luminosity
(extinction corrected) of $-20.9$ magnitude, then fading 0.5 magnitude over 200
days, settling into a plateau of $>600$ days. Following the optical brightening
are the significant mid-IR flares at $3.4$ and $4.5\mu$m, with a peak time
delay of $\sim180$ days. The mid-IR LCs are explained as the echo of UV photons
by a dust medium with a radius of $5\times10^{17}$ cm, consistent with $\rm
E(B-V)$ of 0.58 inferred from the spectra. This event is very energetic with an
extinction corrected $L_{bol} \sim 4\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical
spectra over 400 days in the plateau phase revealed newly formed broad
H$\alpha, \beta$ emission with a FWHM of $\sim3750$ km s$^{-1}$ and narrow
coronal lines such as [Fe VII], [Ne V]. This flare also has a steeply rising UV
continuum, detected by multi-epoch $Swift$ data at $+700$ to $+900$ days post
optical peak. The broad Balmer lines and the UV continuum do not show
significant temporal variations. The slow evolving LCs over 1200 days, the
constant Balmer lines and UV continuum at late-times rule out TDE and SN IIn as
the physical model for this event. We propose that this event is a `turn-on'
AGN, transitioning from a quiescent state to a type 1 AGN with a sub-Eddington
accretion rate of $0.017M_\odot$/yr. This change occurred on a very short time
scale of $\sim 120- 200$ days. The discovery of such a rapid `turn-on' AGN

mass ratio of the sample, M_BH/M_h = 6 x 10^{-4}, means that 0.4% of the

amount to ~ 10% of the SFRs, or ~ 1% of the mean baryon accretion rates, of the
hosting galaxies. A large fraction of the hosting galaxies are consistent with
average galaxies in terms of SFR and perhaps of stellar mass and size. Our
study indicates that the growth of SMBHs (M_BH ~ 10^{8-10} Msun) in luminous z
~ 6 QSOs greatly precedes that of hosting halos owing to efficient gas
accretion even under normal star formation activities, although we cannot rule
out the possibility that undetected SMBHs have local M_BH/M_h ratios. This
preceding growth is in contrast to much milder evolution of the stellar-to-halo
mass ratio.

whether it is worthwhile to carry on with the learning process or to terminate
it. In many such situations, stochastic elements are often present which govern
the occurrence of rewards, with the sequential occurrences of positive rewards
randomly interleaved with negative rewards. For most practical learners, the
learning is considered useful if the number of positive rewards always exceeds
the negative ones. A situation that often calls for learning termination is
when the number of negative rewards exceeds the number of positive rewards.
However, while this seems reasonable, the error of premature termination,
whereby termination is enacted along with the conclusion of learning failure
despite the positive rewards eventually far outnumber the negative ones, can be
significant. In this paper, using combinatorial analysis we study the error
probability in wrongly terminating a reinforcement learning activity which
undermines the effectiveness of an optimal policy, and we show that the
resultant error can be quite high. Whilst we demonstrate mathematically that
such errors can never be eliminated, we propose some practical mechanisms that
can effectively reduce such errors. Simulation experiments have been carried
out, the results of which are in close agreement with our theoretical findings.

observations acquired over a 3-year period during the decline of Carrington
Cycle 24 to test models of RV variation of Sun-like stars. A purpose-built
solar telescope at the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the
Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) provides disk-integrated solar spectra, from
which we extract RVs and $\log{R'_{\rm HK}}$. The Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) provides disk-resolved images of magnetic activity. The Solar Radiation
and Climate Experiment (SORCE) provides near-continuous solar photometry,
analogous to a Kepler light curve. We verify that the SORCE photometry and
HARPS-N $\log{R'_{\rm HK}}$ correlate strongly with the SDO-derived magnetic
filling factor, while the HARPS-N RV variations do not. To explain this
discrepancy, we test existing models of RV variations. We estimate the
contributions of the suppression of convective blueshift and the rotational
imbalance due to brightness inhomogeneities to the observed HARPS-N RVs. We
investigate the time variation of these contributions over several rotation
periods, and how these contributions depend on the area of active regions. We
find that magnetic active regions smaller than $60 \ \rm Mm^2$ do not
significantly suppress convective blueshift. Our area-dependent model reduces
the amplitude of activity-induced RV variations by a factor of two. The present
study highlights the need to identify a proxy that correlates specifically with
large, bright magnetic regions on the surfaces of exoplanet-hosting stars.

estimated to have a scale height of $\sim 3000~{\rm km}$, yet recent
observations revealed completely flat transmission spectra for Kepler 51b and

outflowing ($\dot{M}\gtrsim 10^{-10}~M_\oplus~{\rm yr}^{-1}$) atmospheres that
carry very small dust grains ($\sim 10~{\rm A}$ in size, $\sim 10^{-2}$ in mass

cloud elevation and production of photochemical haze at such high altitudes. We
propose to test this scenario by extending the wavelength coverage of
transmission spectra. If true, dusty atmospheric outflows may affect many young

networked system described by linear time-invariant dynamics. We assume that
the topology of the underlying network is fixed and that the set of feasible
edge weights is a given polytope. In this setting, we first consider a
feasibility problem consisting of tuning the edge weights such that certain
controllability properties are satisfied. The particular controllability
properties under consideration are (i) a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue
of the controllability Gramian, which is related to the worst-case energy
needed to control the system, and (ii) an upper bound on the trace of the
Gramian inverse, which is related to the average control energy. In both cases,
the edge-tuning problem can be stated as a feasibility problem involving
bilinear matrix equalities, which we approach using a sequence of convex
relaxations. Furthermore, we also address a design problem consisting of
finding edge weights able to satisfy the aforementioned controllability
constraints while seeking to minimize a cost function of the edge weights,
which we assume to be convex. In particular, we consider a sparsity-promoting

\cite{Ledoux18}. We give two alternative proofs to this fact. In particular, we
achieve a smaller $C_V$ than before, which equals the double of Poincar\'e
constant. Applying the same argument leads to more characterizations of the
Poincar\'e inequality. Our method also yields a by-product as the equivalence
between the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and strict contraction of heat flow
in Wasserstein space provided that the Bakry-\'Emery curvature has a lower
bound (here the control constants may depend on the curvature bound).
  Next, we present a comparison inequality between $W_2^2(f\mu,\mu)$ and its

\mu(\sqrt{f})|^2}{\mathrm{Var}_\mu (\sqrt{f})}$, which may be viewed as some
special counterpart of the Rothaus' lemma for relative entropy. Then it yields
some new bound of $W_2^2(f\mu,\mu)$ associated to the variance of $\sqrt{f}$
rather than $f$. As a by-product, we have another proof to derive the quadratic
transportation-information inequality from Lyapunov condition, avoiding the
Bobkov-G\""otze's characterization of the Talagrand's inequality.

in the fields of environmental and nutritional epidemiology. Various strategies
have arisen to answer questions about mixtures, including methods such as
weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression that estimate a joint effect of the
mixture components.We demonstrate a new approach to estimating the joint
effects of a mixture: quantile g-computation. This approach combines the
inferential simplicity of WQS regression with the flexibility of g-computation,
a method of causal effect estimation. We use simulations to examine whether
quantile g-computation and WQS regression can accurately and precisely estimate
effects of mixtures in common scenarios. We examine the bias, confidence
interval coverage, and bias-variance tradeoff of quantile g-computation and WQS
regression, and how these quantities are impacted by the presence of non-causal
exposures, exposure correlation, unmeasured confounding, and non-linear
effects. Quantile g-computation, unlike WQS regression allows inference on
mixture effects that is unbiased with appropriate confidence interval coverage
at sample sizes typically encountered in epidemiologic studies and when the
assumptions of WQS regression are not met. Further, WQS regression can magnify
bias from unmeasured confounding that might occur if important components of
the mixture are omitted. Unlike inferential approaches that examine effects of
individual exposures, methods like quantile g-computation that can estimate the
effect of a mixture are essential for understanding effects of potential public
health actions that act on exposure sources. Our approach may serve to help
bridge gaps between epidemiologic analysis and interventions such as
regulations on industrial emissions or mining processes, dietary changes, or
consumer behavioral changes that act on multiple exposures simultaneously.

attribute transfer model to map non-identity related facial attributes to the
face of donors, who are a small number (usually 2 to 3) of consented subjects.
Using the donors' faces ensures that the natural appearance of the synthesized

original faces to diversify the appearance of the synthesized faces.
Experimental results on several sets of images and videos demonstrate the

magnetoelectric effect in metals, referred to as the Edelstein effect or the
inverse spin galvanic effect, our mechanism relies on virtual interband
transitions between the valence and conduction bands and therefore immune to
disorder or impurity scattering. By calculating electric field-induced
magnetization by the linear response theory, we reveal that the magnetoelectric
effect shows up without specific parameter choices. The magnetoelectric effect
qualitatively varies by changing the direction of the magnetic moment in the
ferromagnet: the response is diagonal for the out-of-plane moment, whereas it
is off-diagonal for the inplane moment. We also find out that in optical
frequencies, the magnetoelectric signal can be drastically enhanced via
interband resonant excitations. Finally, we estimate the magnitude of the
magnetoelectric effect for a hybrid halide perovskite semiconductor as an
example of the band insulator and compare it with other magnetoelectric
materials. We underscore that our mechanism is quite general and widely
expectable, only requiring the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange
coupling. Our result could potentially offer a promising method of Joule

state-of-the-art methods in VG operate in a two-stage manner, wherein the first
stage an object detector is adopted to generate a set of object proposals from

matching problem that finds the best match between the language query and all

proposals produced in the first stage that need to be compared in the second
stage, not to mention this strategy performs inaccurately. In this paper, we

long-standing challenge because the mirror velocity needs to approach the speed

mechanical DCE in an optomechanical system. It employs a detuned, parametric
driving to squeeze a cavity mode, so that the mechanical mode, with a typical
resonance frequency, can parametrically and resonantly couple to the squeezed
cavity mode, thus leading to a resonantly amplified DCE in the squeezed frame.
The DCE process can be interpreted as {\it mechanically-induced two-photon
hyper-Raman scattering} in the laboratory frame. Specifically, {\it a photon
pair} of the parametric driving absorbs a single phonon and then is scattered
into an anti-Stokes sideband. We also find that the squeezing, which
additionally induces and amplifies the DCE, can be extremely small. Our method
requires neither an ultra-high mechanical-oscillation frequency (i.e., a mirror
moving at nearly the speed of light) nor an ultrastrong single-photon
optomechanical coupling and, thus, could be implemented in a wide range of

the elimination of excessive relay switching rate and the feedback reduction
avoiding the requirement of having full channel state information at the source
node. For a homogeneous Poisson point process of candidate relays, we first
derive the distribution for the distance of the relay (relative to the source

policy. This result is independent of the functional form of the path-loss
function as long as it is a non-increasing function of the transmitter-receiver

then obtain analytical expressions for the average rate and outage probability
by considering the power-law decaying path-loss function for the no-fading and
Rayleigh fading communication scenarios. It is observed that the optimum relay

entities between different information networks, which has become a
prerequisite step for effective fusion of multiple information networks. In
this paper, we will study the network alignment problem to fuse online social
networks specifically. Social network alignment is extremely challenging to
address due to several reasons, i.e., lack of training data, network
heterogeneity and one-to-one constraint. Existing network alignment works
usually require a large number of training data, but such a demand can hardly
be met in applications, as manual anchor link labeling is extremely expensive.
Significantly different from other homogeneous network alignment works,
information in online social networks is usually of heterogeneous categories,
the incorporation of which in model building is not an easy task. Furthermore,
the one-to-one cardinality constraint on anchor links renders their inference
process intertwistingly correlated. To resolve these three challenges, a novel
network alignment model, namely ActiveIter, is introduced in this paper.
ActiveIter defines a set of inter-network meta diagrams for anchor link feature
extraction, adopts active learning for effective label query and uses greedy
link selection for anchor link cardinality filtering. Extensive experiments are
conducted on real-world aligned networks datasets, and the experimental results
have demonstrated the effectiveness of ActiveIter compared with other

solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE). Its application
comprises two steps: (1) replacement of the original PDE with an extended
system separating the large scales from the small, and (2) reduction of the
extended system to its slow manifold. In the context of variational fluid
theories with particle relabeling symmetry, nonlinear WKB in the mean Eulerian
frame is known to possess a variational structure. This much has been
demonstrated using, for instance, the theoretical apparatus known as the
generalized Lagrangian mean. On the other hand, the variational structure of
nonlinear WKB in the conventional Eulerian frame remains mysterious. By
exhibiting a variational principle for the extended equations from step (1)
above, we demonstrate that nonlinear WKB in the Eulerian frame is in fact
variational. Remarkably, the variational principle for the extended system
admits loops of relabeling transformations as a symmetry group. Noether's
theorem therefore implies that the extended Eulerian equations possess a family
of circulation invariants parameterized by $S^1$. As an illustrative example,
we use our results to systematically deduce a variational model of
high-frequency acoustic waves interacting with a larger-scale compressible
isothermal flow.

to depend on the null time coordinate (a la Vaidya). The spacetime metric is \[
ds^{2}=-\left(1-\frac{2m(w)}{\sqrt{r^{2}+a^{2}}}\right)dw^{2}-(\pm 2 \,dw \,dr)
+\left(r^{2}+a^{2}\right)\left(d\theta^{2}+\sin^{2}\theta \;d\phi^{2}\right).
\] Here $w=\{u,v\}$ denotes the $\{outgoing,ingoing\}$ null time coordinate;
representing $\{retarded,advanced\}$ time. This spacetime is still simple
enough to be tractable, and neatly interpolates between Vaidya spacetime, a
black-bounce, and a traversable wormhole. We show how this metric can be used
to describe several physical situations of particular interest, including a
growing black-bounce, a wormhole to black-bounce transition, and the opposite
black-bounce to wormhole transition.

fairness. It predicts that responders should accept any nonzero offer and
proposers should offer the smallest possible amount according to orthodox game
theory. However, the prediction strongly contradicts with experimental findings
where responders usually reject low offers below $20\%$ and proposers usually
make higher offers than expected. To explain the evolution of such fair
behaviors, we here introduce empathy in group-structured populations by
allowing a proportion $\alpha$ of the population to play empathetic strategies.
Interestingly, we find that for high mutation probabilities, the mean offer
decreases with $\alpha$ and the mean demand increases, implying empathy
inhibits the evolution of fairness. For low mutation probabilities, the mean
offer and demand approach to the fair ones with increasing $\alpha$, implying
empathy promotes the evolution of fairness. Furthermore, under both weak and
strong intensities of natural selection, we analytically calculate the mean
offer and demand for different levels of $\alpha$. Counterintuitively, we
demonstrate that although a higher mutation probability leads to a higher level
of fairness under weak selection, an intermediate mutation probability
corresponds to the lowest level of fairness under strong selection. Our study
provides systematic insights into the evolutionary origin of fairness in
group-structured populations with empathetic strategies.

the task of extracting the respiration signal from a given input PPG as opposed
to extracting respiration rate. The proposed network was trained and tested on
two different datasets utilizing different modalities of reference respiration

fully absorbed into the ferromagnet. However, in the state-of-art multilayer

longitudinal velocity of the electrons during their collision, leading to
considerable non-linear broadening in the scattered radiation spectra. The
effects of such ponderomotive broadening are so deleterious that most inverse
Compton sources either remain at low laser intensities or pay a steep price to
operate at a small fraction of the physically possible peak spectral output.
This ponderomotive broadening can be reduced by a suitable frequency modulation

additional challenge. The quantity of interest is average finite population

is assisted by using the three-parameter generalized gamma distribution,
thereby robustifying our procedure against a possible model failure. Using
conditional predictive ordinates, we show that the model, which accommodates
length bias, performs better than the model that does not. In the Bayesian
computation, we overcome a technical problem associated with Gibbs sampling by

among multiple clusters, while communities for which the resolution parameter
is smaller than their background inter-community edge density will be merged
into one large component. Therefore, no suitable resolution parameter exits

propose a progressive agglomerative heuristic algorithm to detect practically
significant communities at multiple scales.

This kind of technique is widely used for motion capturing of humans, and to

use such systems, large and precise datasets are required for the machine
learning (ML) procedure. This can be especially difficult for extreme/wild
motions such as acrobatic movements or motions in specific sports, which are
difficult to estimate in typically provided training models. In addition,
training may take a long duration, and will require a high-grade GPU for
sufficient speed. To address these issues, we propose a method to improve the

Analogous to TS, which, at each decision epoch pulls an arm that is best with

is given a data sequence in an online fashion and asked to predict a

to choose when to make the prediction as well as the length of the prediction

without any distributional assumption on the input data stream, a large family
of statistics can be estimated to non-trivial accuracy. To give one concrete
example, suppose that we are given access to an arbitrary binary sequence $x_1,
\ldots, x_n$ of length $n$. Our goal is to accurately predict the average
observation, and we are allowed to choose the window over which the prediction
is made: for some $t < n$ and $m \le n - t$, after seeing $t$ observations we
predict the average of $x_{t+1}, \ldots, x_{t+m}$. This particular problem was
first studied in Drucker (2013) and referred to as the ""density prediction
game"". We show that the expected squared error of our prediction can be bounded
by $O(\frac{1}{\log n})$ and prove a matching lower bound, which resolves an
open question raised in Drucker (2013). This result holds for any sequence
(that is not adaptive to when the prediction is made, or the predicted value),
and the expectation of the error is with respect to the randomness of the

surprisingly, the anomalous phase shift is non-trivial and is inherited from
the non-trivial Berry's phase of the linear Dirac band due to strong
filling-enforced constraints between the linear and quadratic band Fermi
surfaces. Given that many topological materials contain multiple bands, our
work indicates how additional bands, which are thought to obscure the analysis,

robust even in the presence of bulk states and, therefore, they validate the

introduce new out-of-plane field configurations, which cannot be accounted for

used to simulate core-collapse supernova explosions in spherical symmetry (1D)
more consistently than with traditional approaches for parameterised 1D models.
However, a closer analysis of the proposed schemes reveals important
consistency problems. Most notably, they systematically violate energy
conservation as they do not balance buoyant energy generation with terms that
reduce potential energy, thus failing to account for the physical source of
energy that buoyant convection feeds on. We also point out other non-trivial
consistency requirements for viable turbulence models. The model of Kuhfuss
(1986) proves more consistent than the newly proposed approaches for
supernovae, but still cannot account naturally for all the relevant physics for
predicting explosion properties. We perform numerical simulations for a $20
M_\odot$ progenitor to further illustrate problems of 1D turbulence models. If
the buoyant driving term is formulated in a conservative manner, the explosion
energy of $\mathord{\sim}2\times 10^{51}\, \mathrm{erg}$ for the corresponding
non-conservative turbulence model is reduced to $<10^{48}\,\mathrm{erg}$ even
though the shock expands continuously. This demonstrates that the conservation
problem cannot be ignored. Although plausible energies can be reached using an
energy-conserving model when turbulent viscosity is included, it is doubtful
whether the energy budget of the explosion is regulated by the same mechanism
as in multi-dimensional models. We conclude that 1D turbulence models based on
a spherical Reynolds decomposition cannot provide a more consistent approach to
supernova explosion and remnant properties than other phenomenological
approaches before some fundamental problems are addressed.

apply this method to examine in detail two sets of examples, $3+1$-dimensional

as a power $\sim 1/L^4$. We explain that dependence in terms of a double-trace
deformation in a one-dimensional defect theory. For a confining theory, the
decay is exponential $\sim e^{-ML}$, with $M$ a scale of the order of the

One way of mending these structural inadequacies is through patching, whereby
the outermost layers of 1D models are replaced by the mean stratifications from
3D simulations. In order to viably implement this approach in asteroseismic
analysis, interpolation throughout precomputed 3D envelopes is required. We
present a method that interpolates throughout precomputed 3D envelopes as a
function of effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. We conduct
a series of validation tests that demonstrate that the scheme reliably and
accurately reproduces the structures of stellar envelopes and apply our method
to the Sun as well as two stars observed by Kepler. We parameterize the
frequency shift that results from patching and show that the functional forms
are evolutionary dependent. In addition we find that neglecting modal effects,
such as non-adiabatic energetics, introduces systematic errors in
asteroseimically obtained stellar parameters. Both these results suggest that a
cautious approach is necessary when utilizing empirical surface corrections in

i.e., twin beams, generated by a coherent atomic medium to surpass the
shot-noise limit (SNL) of the displacement measurement of a membrane in an
optical cavity. The sensitivity of 200 $am/\sqrt {Hz}$ is achieved, which is
more than two orders of magnitude better than a standard Michelson
interferometer. An improvement of 3 $dB$ in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
beyond the SNL is realized at an equivalent optical power, by using quantum
correlated light with noise squeezed 7 $dB$ below the vacuum level. Moreover,
the frequency correlation of twin beams is directly measured by using optical
cavities, and this relation is utilized to reduce the excess classical noise.
Additionally, the displacement measurement sensitivity is further substantially
enhanced by the cavity mediated dispersion and the SNR is increased by one
order of magnitude compared to the free space case. These results provide a

evolution community, even more since the recent asteroseismic surveys. All
published studies on rotation using asteroseismic observations show a
discrepancy between the observed and calculated rotation rates, indicating
there is an undetermined process of angular momentum transport active in these
stars. We aim to constrain the efficiency of this process by investigating
rotation rates of 2.5 M$_{\odot}$ stars. First, we investigated whether the
Tayler-Spruit dynamo could be responsible for the extra transport of angular
momentum for stars with an initial mass of 2.5 M$_{\odot}$. Then, by computing
rotating models including a constant additional artificial viscosity, we
determined the efficiency of the missing process of angular momentum transport
by comparing the models to the asteroseismic observations of core helium
burning stars. Parameter studies were performed to investigate the effect of
the stellar evolution code used, initial mass, and evolutionary stage. We
evolved our models into the white dwarf phase, and provide a comparison to
white dwarf rotation rates. The Tayler-Spruit dynamo is unable to provide
enough transport of angular momentum to reach the observed values of the core
helium burning stars investigated in this paper. We find that a value for the
additional artificial viscosity $\nu_{\rm{add}}$ around 10$^7$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$
provides enough transport of angular momentum. However, the rotational period
of these models is too high in the white dwarf phase to match the white dwarf
observations. From this comparison we infer that the efficiency of the missing
process must decrease during the core helium burning phase. When excluding the
$\nu_{\rm{add}}$ during core helium burning phase, we can match the rotational
periods of both the core helium burning stars and white dwarfs.

ion finite Larmor radius corrections, parallel magnetic field fluctuations and
electron inertia, is used to study turbulent cascades from the MHD to the
sub-ion scales. Special attention is paid to the case of imbalance between
waves propagating along or opposite to the ambient magnetic field. For weak
turbulence in the absence of electron inertia, kinetic equations for the
spectral density of the conserved quantities (total energy and generalized
cross-helicity) are obtained. They provide a global description, matching
between the regimes of reduced MHD at large scales and electron reduced MHD at
small scales, previously considered in the literature. In the limit of
ultra-local interactions, Leith-type nonlinear diffusion equations in the
Fourier space are derived and heuristically extended to the strong turbulence
regime by modifying the transfer time appropriately. Relations with existing
phenomenological models for imbalanced MHD and balanced sub-ion turbulence are
discussed. It turns out that in the presence of dispersive effects, the
dynamics is sensitive on the way turbulence is maintained in a steady state.
Furthermore, the total energy spectrum at sub-ion scales becomes steeper as the
generalized cross-helicity flux is increased.

genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genetic markers, known as
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), are used in GWAS. This raises privacy and
security concerns as these genetic markers can be used to identify individuals
uniquely. This problem is further exacerbated by a large number of SNPs needed,
which produce reliable results at a higher risk of compromising the privacy of
participants.
  We describe a method using homomorphic encryption (HE) to perform GWAS in a
secure and private setting. This work is based on a proposed algorithm. Our
solution mainly involves homomorphically encrypted matrix operations and
suitable approximations that adapts the semi-parallel GWAS algorithm for HE. We
leverage the complex space of the CKKS encryption scheme to increase the number
of SNPs that can be packed within a ciphertext. We have also developed a cache
module that manages ciphertexts, reducing the memory footprint.
  We have implemented our solution over two HE open source libraries, HEAAN and
SEAL. Our best implementation took $24.70$ minutes for a dataset with $245$
samples, over $4$ covariates and $10643$ SNPs.

HBB while the total Ca in these stars could be affected by neutron captures.
The Li abundances were previously studied with hydrostatic models, while the Ca
abundances have been determined for the first time. We use a modified version
of Turbospectrum and consider the presence of a gaseous circumstellar envelope
and radial wind. The new Li abundances derived with the pseudo-dynamical models
are very similar to those obtained from hydrostatic models (the average
difference is 0.18 dex), with no difference for Ca. The Li and Ca content in
these stars is only slightly affected by the presence of a circumstellar
envelope. We also found that the Li I and Ca I line profiles are not very
sensitive to variations of the model wind parameters. The new Li abundances
confirm the Li-rich nature of the sample stars, supporting the activation of
HBB in massive Galactic AGB stars. This is in good agreement with the
theoretical predictions for solar metallicity AGB models from ATON, Monash, and
NuGrid/MESA but is at odds with the FRUITY database, which predicts no HBB
leading to the production of Li. Most sample stars display nearly solar Ca
abundances that are consistent with the available s-process nucleosynthesis
models for solar metallicity massive AGB stars, which predict overproduction of
46Ca relatively to the other Ca isotope and the creation of the radiactive
isotope 41Ca but no change in the total Ca abundance. A minority of the stars

  Perception: Higher Peak SNR Does Not Mean Better Semantic Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The high amount of sensors required for autonomous driving poses enormous
challenges on the capacity of automotive bus systems. There is a need to
understand tradeoffs between bitrate and perception performance. In this paper,
we compare the image compression standards JPEG, JPEG2000, and WebP to a modern
encoder/decoder image compression approach based on generative adversarial
networks (GANs). We evaluate both the pure compression performance using
typical metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural
similarity (SSIM) and others, but also the performance of a subsequent
perception function, namely a semantic segmentation (characterized by the mean
intersection over union (mIoU) measure). Not surprisingly, for all investigated
compression methods, a higher bitrate means better results in all investigated
quality metrics. Interestingly, however, we show that the semantic segmentation
mIoU of the GAN autoencoder in the highly relevant low-bitrate regime (at
0.0625 bit/pixel) is better by 3.9% absolute than JPEG2000, although the latter
still is considerably better in terms of PSNR (5.91 dB difference). This effect
can greatly be enlarged by training the semantic segmentation model with images
originating from the decoder, so that the mIoU using the segmentation model
trained by GAN reconstructions exceeds the use of the model trained with
original images by almost 20% absolute. We conclude that distributed perception
in future autonomous driving will most probably not provide a solution to the
automotive bus capacity bottleneck by using standard compression schemes such
as JPEG2000, but requires modern coding approaches, with the GAN
encoder/decoder method being a promising candidate.

reconstructed form of the function $F(X)$. This reconstruction has been
performed for different varying dark energy models at best-fit values of

$k-$essence model, we also investigate the variation of adiabatic sound speed
squared, $c_s^2(z)$, and obtained the domains in ($w_a, w_b$) parameter space
corresponding to the physical bound $ c_s^2>0$ implying stability of density

chemical potential of a metallic system when the carrier density increases.
This effect has often been invoked in the past to explain the enhancement of
the capacitance beyond the classical limits in capacitors with two-dimensional
electron gases as electrodes. Based on experiments on strongly confined
semiconductor quantum wells (QWs), it has been traditionally ascribed to the
electron exchange energy as the main driving force. Recent research, however,
has revealed that analogous effects can occur in other classes of materials
systems, such as polar oxide interfaces, whose characteristics drastically
depart from those of the previously considered cases. To rationalize these new
results, it is necessary to revisit the established theory of confined electron
gases, and test whether its conclusions are valid beyond the specifics of
semiconductor-based QWs. Here we find, based on first-principles calculations
of jellium slabs, that one must indeed be very careful when extrapolating
existing results to other realistic physical systems. In particular, we
identify a number of additional, previously overlooked mechanisms (e.g.,
related to the displacement of the electronic cloud and to the multiband
structure of the delocalized gas), that enter into play and become new sources
of negative capacitance in the weak-confinement regime. Our detailed analysis
of these emerging contributions, supported by analytic models and multiple test
cases, will provide a useful guidance in the ongoing quest for nanometric
capacitors with enhanced performance.

shear flow on heat flux. By simulating a simple fluid in a channel bounded by
tethered atoms, the heat flux is computed for two systems: a temperature driven
one with no flow and a wall driven, Couette flow system. The results for the
temperature driven system give the Fourier's law thermal conductivity, which is
shown to agree well with experiments. Through comparison of the two systems, we
quantify the additional components of the heat flux parallel and normal to the
walls due to shear flow. To compute the heat flux in the flow direction, the
Irving-Kirkwood equations are integrated over a volume, giving the so-called
volume average form, and they are also manipulated to get expressions for the
surface averaged and method of planes forms. The method of planes and volume
average forms are shown to give equivalent results for the heat flux when using
small volumes. The heat flux in the flow direction is obtained consistently
over a range of simulations, and it is shown to vary linearly with strain rate,
as predicted by theory. The additional strain rate dependent component of the
heat flux normal to the wall is obtained by fitting the strain rate dependence
of the heat flux to the expected form. As a result, the additional terms in the
thermal conductivity tensor quantified in this work should be experimentally
testable.

approximate envy-freeness in settings with indivisible goods. Among them, the
concept of envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) is arguably the closest to
envy-freeness. Unfortunately, EFX allocations are not known to exist except in
a few special cases. We make significant progress in this direction. We show
that for every instance with additive valuations, there is an EFX allocation of
a subset of items with a Nash welfare that is at least half of the maximum
possible Nash welfare for the original set of items. That is, after donating
some items to a charity, one can distribute the remaining items in a fair way
with high efficiency. This bound is proved to be best possible. Our proof is
constructive and highlights the importance of maximum Nash welfare allocation.
Starting with such an allocation, our algorithm decides which items to donate
and redistributes the initial bundles to the agents, eventually obtaining an
allocation with the claimed efficiency guarantee. The application of our
algorithm to large markets, where the valuations of an agent for every item is
relatively small, yields EFX with almost optimal Nash welfare. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first use of large market assumptions in the fair
division literature. We also show that our algorithm can be modified to
compute, in polynomial-time, EFX allocations that approximate optimal Nash
welfare within a factor of at most $2\rho$, using a $\rho$-approximate
allocation on input instead of the maximum Nash welfare one.

Al foils deformed in uniaxial tension by means of the analysis of the slip

misorientations were measured on both surfaces of the sample using electron
back-scattered diffraction mapping. It was found that most of the grains were
within 15{\deg} of a cube orientation and approximately half of the grains
percolated through the specimen thickness. The Luster-Morris m' parameter (that
can be computed from the surface grain orientation) was used to assess the
likelihood of slip transfer across boundaries. It was found that transfer
across grain boundaries was rare in near-cube oriented grains, and convincing
evidence was only found when m' > 0.97, which corresponds to low-angle
boundaries with <15{\deg} misorientation. This behavior was explained by the
presence of many active slip slips in near-cube oriented grains that favor
self-accommodation of the grain shape to the evolving boundary conditions
imposed by neighboring grains instead of promoting slip transfer across the
boundary. These results indicate that the alignment between slip planes and
slip directions across the boundary is not the only important metric to
determine the threshold for slip transfer, as the particular details of

accompanied by a corona consisting of multitudinous streamers perturbing the
air in its vicinity and leaving residual charge behind. We explore the relative
importance of air perturbations and preionization on the production of
energetic run-away electrons by 2.5D cylindrical Monte Carlo particle
simulations of streamers in ambient fields of 16 kV cm$^{-1}$ and 50 kV
cm$^{-1}$ at ground pressure. We explore preionization levels between $10^{10}$
m$^{-3}$ and $10^{13}$ m$^{-3}$, channel widths between 0.5 and 1.5 times the
original streamer widths and air perturbation levels between 0\% and 50\% of
ambient air. We observe that streamers in preionized and perturbed air
accelerate more efficiently than in non-ionized and uniform air with air
perturbation dominating the streamer acceleration. We find that in unperturbed
air preionization levels of $10^{11}$ m$^{-3}$ are sufficient to explain
run-away electron rates measured in conjunction with terrestrial gamma-ray
flashes. In perturbed air, the production rate of runaway electrons varies from
$10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$ to $10^{17}$ s$^{-1}$ with maximum electron energies from
some hundreds of eV up to some hundreds of keV in fields above and below the
breakdown strength. In the presented simulations the number of runaway
electrons matches with the number of energetic electrons measured in alignment
with the observations of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. Conclusively, the
complexity of the streamer zone ahead of leader tips allows explaining the
emission of energetic electrons and photons from streamer discharges.

inspired by fault trees, a well-known formalism used in safety engineering. In
this paper we define and implement the translation of attack-fault trees (AFTs)
to a new extension of timed automata, called parametric weighted timed
automata. This allows us to parametrize constants such as time and discrete
costs in an AFT and then, using the model-checker IMITATOR, to compute the set
of parameter values such that a successful attack is possible. Using the
different sets of parameter values computed, different attack and fault
scenarios can be deduced depending on the budget, time or computation power of
the attacker, providing helpful data to select the most efficient
counter-measure.

introduce Apollo, a universal assembly polishing algorithm that scales well to

computing, an emerging computing paradigm which allows anytime & anywhere
computing possible. In such a ubiquitous computing environment, customers
release different computing or sensing tasks, and people, also known as data
processors, participate in these tasks and get paid for providing their idle
computing and communication resources. Thus, how to select an appropriate and
reliable customer while not disclosing processors' privacy has become an
interesting problem. In this article, we present a trust-based and
privacy-preserving customer selection scheme in ubiquitous computing, called
TPCS, to enable potential processors select the customers with good reputation.
The basic concept of TPCS is that each data processor holds a trust value, and
the reputation score of the customer is calculated based on processors' trust
values and feedbacks via a truth discovery process. To preserve processors'
privacy, pseudonyms and Paillier cryptosystem are applied to conceal each
processor's real identity. In addition, three authentication protocols are
designed to ensure that only the valid data processors (i.e., the processors
registering in the system, holding the truthful trust values, and joining the
computing tasks) can pass the authentication. A comprehensive security analysis
is conducted to prove that our proposed TPCS scheme is secure and can defend
against several sophisticated attacks. Moreover, extensive simulations are
conducted to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.

and by use of evolutionary algorithms, neural network structures optimally
adapted to a given task can be explored. Guiding such neuroevolution with
additional objectives related to network structure has been shown to improve
performance in some cases, especially when modular neural networks are
beneficial. However, apart from objectives aiming to make networks more
modular, such structural objectives have not been widely explored. We propose
two new structural objectives and test their ability to guide evolving neural
networks on two problems which can benefit from decomposition into subtasks.
The first structural objective guides evolution to align neural networks with a
user-recommended decomposition pattern. Intuitively, this should be a powerful
guiding target for problems where human users can easily identify a structure.
The second structural objective guides evolution towards a population with a
high diversity in decomposition patterns. This results in exploration of many
different ways to decompose a problem, allowing evolution to find good
decompositions faster. Tests on our target problems reveal that both methods
perform well on a problem with a very clear and decomposable structure.
However, on a problem where the optimal decomposition is less obvious, the
structural diversity objective is found to outcompete other structural
objectives -- and this technique can even increase performance on problems
without any decomposable structure at all.

bond-operator formalism at the harmonic level and show that, for both dimerized
Heisenberg models, the entanglement entropies of the corresponding VBS ground
states obey an area law as expected for gapped phases. For both columnar-dimer
and staggered-dimer models, we also show that the entanglement entropies
increase but do not diverge as the dimerization decreases and the system
approaches the N\'eel--VBS quantum phase transition. Finally, the entanglement
spectra associated with the VBS ground states are presented.

a way that each region of which involves a semantic concept. In a weakly
supervised manner, since only image-level labels are available, discriminating
objects from the background is challenging, and in some cases, much more
difficult. More specifically, some objects which are commonly seen in one
specific scene (e.g. 'train' typically is seen on 'railroad track') are much
more likely to be confused. In this paper, we propose a method to add the
target-specific scenes in order to overcome the aforementioned problem.
Actually, we propose a scene recommender which suggests to add some specific
scene contexts to the target dataset in order to train the model more
accurately. It is notable that this idea could be a complementary part of the
baselines of many other methods. The experiments validate the effectiveness of
the proposed method for the objects for which the scene context is added.

paradigm that migrates computing from mobile devices to remote servers, can now
use the power of edge computing by offloading computation to cloudlets in
edge-clouds. However, the task scheduling of computation offloading in
edge-clouds faces a two-fold challenge. First, as cloudlets are geographically

research labs (above 23%), there is a need of experimental procedures that
allow their fabrication at ambient conditions, which would decrease
substantially manufacturing costs. However, under ambient conditions, a
delicate control of the moisture level in the atmosphere has to be enforced to
achieve efficient and highly stable devices. In this work, we show that it is
the absolute content of water measured in the form of partial water vapour
pressure (WVP) the only determining control parameter that needs to be
considered during preparation. Following this perspective, MAPbI3 perovskite
films were deposited under different WVP by changing the relative humidity (RH)
and the lab temperature. We found that efficient and reproducible devices can
be obtained at given values of WVP. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that small
temperature changes, at the same value of the RH, result in huge changes in
performance, due to the non-linear dependence of the WVP on temperature. We
have extended the procedure to accomplish high-efficient FA0.83MA0.17PbI3
devices at ambient conditions by adjusting DMSO proportion in precursor
solution as a function of WVP only. As an example of the relevance of this
paramater, a WVP value of around of 1.6 kPa appears to be an upper limit for
safe fabrication of high efficiency devices at ambient conditions, regardless
the RH and lab temperature.

random sequential adsorption in one dimension with point source and steric
interactions. Particles enter sequentially an initially empty row of $L$ sites
and adsorb irreversibly at randomly chosen places. If two particles occupy
adjacent sites, they prevent further particles from passing them. A jammed
configuration without available empty sites is eventually reached. More
generally, we investigate the class of models parametrized by $b$, the number
of consecutive particles needed to form a blockage. We show analytically that
the occupations of different sites in jammed configurations exhibit long-range
correlations obeying scaling laws, for all integers $b\ge2$, so that the total
number of particles grows as a subextensive power of $L$, with exponent
$(b-1)/b$, and keeps fluctuating even for very large systems. The exactly known
relative number variance measuring this lack of self-averaging is maximal for
the theater model {\it stricto sensu} ($b=2$). In the special case where $b=1$,
so that each adsorbed particle is a blockage, the model can be mapped onto the
statistics of records in sequences of random variables and of cycles in random
permutations. A two-sided variant of the model is also considered. In both
situations the number of particles grows only logarithmically with $L$, and it
is self-averaging.

high-dimensional problems: Additionally exploiting low-rank structures allows
us to consider parameter spaces of high dimensions. The core of our method is
to express the tensorized interpolation in tensor train (TT) format and to
develop an efficient way, based on tensor completion, to approximate the
interpolation coefficients. We apply the new method to two model problems:
American option pricing in the Heston model and European basket option pricing
in the multi-dimensional Black-Scholes model. In these examples we treat
parameter spaces of dimensions up to 25. The numerical results confirm the
low-rank structure of these problems and the effectiveness of our method

equilibrate locally and are expected to evolve towards a locally thermal
description despite their unitary time evolution. Systems in which disorder
competes with interactions and transport can violate this expectation by
exhibiting many-body localization. The strength of the disorder with respect to
the other two parameters drives a transition from a thermalizing system towards
a non-thermalizing one. The existence of this transition is well established
both in experimental and numerical studies for finite systems. However, the
stability of many-body localization in the thermodynamic limit is largely
unclear. With increasing system size, a generic disordered system will contain
with high probability areas of low disorder variation. If large and frequent
enough, those areas constitute ergodic grains which can hybridize and thus
compete with localization. While the details of this process are not yet
settled, it is conceivable that if such regions appear sufficiently often, they
might be powerful enough to restore thermalization. We set out to shed light on
this problem by constructing potential landscapes with low disorder regions and
numerically investigating their localization behavior in the Heisenberg model.
Our findings suggest that many-body localization may be much more stable than
anticipated in other recent theoretical works.

multi-level resistance states using a half doped CE-type charge ordered
insulating bulk manganite, $Sm_{0.5}Ca_{0.25}Sr_{0.25}MnO_3$ (SCSMO). By
introducing electronic phase coexistence in a controllable manner in SCSMO, we
show that the system can be stabilized into several metastable states, against
thermal cycling, up to 62 K. As a result the magnetization (and the
resistivity) remains unaltered during the thermal cycling. Monte Carlo
calculations using two-band double exchange model, including super-exchange,
electron-phonon coupling, and quenched disorder, show that the system freezes
into a phase coexistence metastable state during the thermal cycling due to the
chemical disorder in SCSMO. Using the obtained insights we outline a pathway by
utilizing four reversible metastable resistance states to design a prototype
multi-bit memory device.

the source of light and scene configurations. Hence, the human visual system
has evolved to be more sensitive to contrast than absolute luminance. This
feature is equally desired for machine vision: the ability to recognise
patterns even when aspects of them are transformed due to variation in local
and global contrast. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the impact of
image contrast on prominent deep convolutional networks, both during the
training and testing phase. The results of conducted experiments testify to an
evident deterioration in the accuracy of all state-of-the-art networks at
low-contrast images. We demonstrate that ""contrast-augmentation"" is a
sufficient condition to endow a network with invariance to contrast. This
practice shows no negative side effects, quite the contrary, it might allow a
model to refrain from other illuminance related over-fittings. This ability can
also be achieved by a short fine-tuning procedure, which opens new lines of
investigation on mechanisms involved in two networks whose weights are over
99.9% correlated, yet astonishingly produce utterly different outcomes. Our
further analysis suggests that the optimisation algorithm is an influential
factor, however with a significantly lower effect; and while the choice of an
architecture manifests a negligible impact on this phenomenon, the first layers
appear to be more critical.

range, battery life, and deployment cost. In LoRa networks, several
transmission parameters can be allocated to ensure efficient and reliable
communication. For example, the configuration of the spreading factor allows
tuning the data rate and the transmission distance. However, how to dynamically
adjust the setting that minimizes the collision probability while meeting the
required communication performance is an open challenge. This paper proposes a
novel Data Rate and Channel Control (DRCC) scheme for LoRa networks so as to
improve wireless resource utilization and support a massive number of LoRa
nodes. The scheme estimates channel conditions based on the short-term Data
Extraction Rate (DER), and opportunistically adjusts the spreading factor to
adapt the variation of channel conditions. Furthermore, the channel control is
carried out to balance the link load of all available channels with the global
information of the channel usage, which is able to lower the access collisions
under dense deployments. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRCC
performs well on improving the reliability and capacity compared with other
spreading factor allocation schemes in dense deployment scenarios.

the cross section for monopole pair production. Using the worldline instanton
method, we work to all orders in the magnetic charge, and hence are not

spacetime inhomogeneity through a single dimensionless parameter, the Keldysh
parameter, which is independent of collision energy for a given monopole mass.
For realistic heavy-ion collisions, the computational cost of the calculation
becomes prohibitive and the finite size of the monopoles needs to be taken into

Nonetheless, our results show that the spacetime dependence enhances the

investigate the new controller on a virtual robot in simulations and do
preliminary testing on a real-world robot. We show that having variable
complexity allows us to adapt to different optimization budgets. With a high
evaluation budget in simulation, a complex controller performs best. Moreover,
real-world evolution with a limited evaluation budget indicates that a lower
gait complexity is preferable for a relatively simple environment.

to process large-scale datasets which may contain private and sensitive

online services rely on cloud computing to store and process the sensitive

paramount concern since the customers need to trust the thirdparty cloud

past. To overcome the potential security risks in the cloud, we answer the
following research question: how to enable secure executions of machine
learning computations in the untrusted infrastructure? To achieve this goal, we
propose a hardware-assisted approach based on Trusted Execution Environments
(TEEs), specifically Intel SGX, to enable secure execution of the machine
learning computations over the private and sensitive datasets. More
specifically, we propose a generic and secure machine learning framework based
on Tensorflow, which enables secure execution of existing applications on the
commodity untrusted infrastructure. In particular, we have built our system
called TensorSCONE from ground-up by integrating TensorFlow with SCONE, a
shielded execution framework based on Intel SGX. The main challenge of this
work is to overcome the architectural limitations of Intel SGX in the context
of building a secure TensorFlow system. Our evaluation shows that we achieve
reasonable performance overheads while providing strong security properties

charge-changing processes in situ. To understand the role of these reactions in
the evolution of the solar wind plasma, and interpret the complex in-situ
measurements made by Rosetta, numerical or analytical models are necessary. We
use an extended analytical formalism describing solar wind charge-changing
processes at comets along solar wind streamlines. The model is driven by solar
wind ion measurements from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium-Ion Composition
Analyzer (RPC-ICA) and neutral density observations from the Rosetta
Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis-Comet Pressure Sensor (ROSINA-COPS),
as well as charge-changing cross sections of hydrogen and helium particles in a
water gas. A mission-wide overview of charge-changing efficiencies at comet 67P
is presented. Electron capture cross sections dominate and favor the production
of He and H energetic neutral atoms, with fluxes expected to rival those of H+
and He2+ ions. Neutral outgassing rates are retrieved from local RPC-ICA flux
measurements, and match ROSINA's estimates very well. From the model, we find
that solar wind charge exchange is unable to fully explain the magnitude of the
sharp drop of solar wind ion fluxes observed by Rosetta for heliocentric
distances below 2.5 AU. This is likely because the model does not take into
account the relative ion dynamics and, to a lesser extent, ignore the formation
of bow shock-like structures upstream of the nucleus. This work also shows that
the ionization by solar EUV radiation and energetic electrons dominates the
source of cometary ions, although solar wind contributions may be significant
during isolated events.

The reliability of

a special constraint. Each codeword of the DNA code has a specific property
that any two consecutive sub-strings of the DNA codeword will not be the same
(a generalization of homo-polymers constraint). This is in addition to the
usual constraints such as Hamming, reverse, reverse-complement and
$GC$-content. We believe that the new constraint will help further in reducing
the errors during reading and writing data into the synthetic DNA strings. We
also present a construction (based on a variant of stochastic local search
algorithm) to calculate the size of the DNA codes with all the above
constraints, which improves the lower bounds from the existing literature, for
some specific cases. Moreover, a recursive isometric map between binary vectors
and DNA strings is proposed. Using the map and the well known binary codes we
obtain few classes of DNA codes with all the constraints including the property
that the constructed DNA codewords are free from the hairpin-like secondary

that impulses acting on the boundary might lead to a trapping of these waves on
the dayside by the ionosphere, resulting in a standing wave or eigenmode of the
magnetopause surface. No direct observational evidence of this has been found
to date and searches for indirect evidence have proved inconclusive, leading to
speculation that this mechanism might not occur. By using fortuitous multipoint
spacecraft observations during a rare isolated fast plasma jet impinging on the

between this NDS and descriptor systems about their
observability/controllability. A necessary and sufficient condition is
established with the associated matrices depending affinely on subsystem
parameters/connections. An attractive property of this condition is that all
the required calculations are performed independently on each individual
subsystem. Except well-posedness, not any other conditions are asked for
subsystem parameters/connections. This is in sharp contrast to recent results
on structural observability/controllability which is proven to be NP hard. Some
characteristics are established for a subsystem which are helpful in
constructing an observable/controllable NDS. It has been made clear that
subsystems with an input matrix of full column rank are helpful in constructing
an observable NDS, while subsystems with an output matrix of full row rank are
helpful in constructing a controllable NDS. These results are extended to an
NDS with descriptor form subsystems. As a byproduct, the full normal rank
condition of previous works on network observability/controllability has been
completely removed. On the other hand, satisfaction of this condition is shown
to be appreciative in building an observable/controllability NDS.

extensive attention and continues to grow in tandem with the economy. Although
the real-time air quality report can be utilized to update our knowledge on air
quality, questions about how pollutants evolve across time and how pollutants
are spatially correlated still remain a puzzle. In view of this point, we adopt
the PMFG network method to analyze the six pollutants' hourly data in 350
Chinese cities in an attempt to find out how these pollutants are correlated
temporally and spatially. In terms of time dimension, the results indicate
that, except for O$_3$, the pollutants have a common feature of the strong
intraday patterns of which the daily variations are composed of two contraction
periods and two expansion periods. Besides, all the time series of the six
pollutants possess strong long-term correlations, and this temporal memory
effect helps to explain why smoggy days are always followed by one after
another. In terms of space dimension, the correlation structure shows that
O$_3$ is characterized by the highest spatial connections. The PMFGs reveal the
relationship between this spatial correlation and provincial administrative
divisions by filtering the hierarchical structure in the correlation matrix and
refining the cliques as the tinny spatial clusters. Finally, we check the
stability of the correlation structure and conclude that, except for PM$_{10}$
and O$_3$, the other pollutants have an overall stable correlation, and all
pollutants have a slight trend to become more divergent in space. These results
not only enhance our understanding of the air pollutants' evolutionary process,
but also shed lights on the application of complex network methods into
geographic issues.

to address the drawbacks of the conventional cooperative WBAN, a QoS-aware

that avoids assumptions about the intent and motivation of any exo-civilization

advancing settlement via probes of finite velocity and range to determine if
the galaxy can become inhabited with space-faring civilizations on timescales
shorter than its age. We also include the effect of stellar motions on the long
term behavior of the settlement front which adds a diffusive component to its
advance. The results of these models demonstrate that the Milky Way can be
readily 'filled-in' with settled stellar systems under conservative assumptions
about interstellar spacecraft velocities and launch rates. We then consider the
question of the galactic steady-state achieved in terms of the fraction of
settled planets. We do this by considering the effect of finite settlement
civilization lifetimes on the steady states. We find a range of parameters for
which the galaxy supports a population of interstellar space-faring
civilizations even though some settleable systems are uninhabited. Both results
point to ways in which Earth might remain unvisited in the midst of an
inhabited galaxy. Finally we consider how our results can be combined with the
finite horizon for evidence of previous settlements in Earth's geologic record.
Our steady-state model can constrain the probabilities for an Earth visit by a
settling civilization before a given time horizon. These results break the link
between Hart's famous ""Fact A"" (no interstellar visitors on Earth now) and the
conclusion that humans must, therefore, be the only technological civilization

internal structure of the neutral atoms. Therefore the components of a mixture
composed of two atomic gases can exhibit a different response to an artificial
magnetic field. Such a mixture can be interpreted as a mixture of two atomic
gases, carrying different synthetic charges. In this article, we consider such
mixtures of two superfluids with unequal synthetic charges in a ring trap
subject to a uniform artificial magnetic field. The charge imbalance in such a
mixture changes the distribution of excited particles over angular momentum
states compared to that of an equally charged mixture. This microscopic
difference exhibits macroscopic consequences; such as the occurrence of an
angular momentum transfer between two unequally charged components. Due to the
inter-fluid atomic interactions in a ring, the angular momentum transfer can
create a counter flowing persistent current in the weakly charged superfluid.
Even in the limiting case of a charged and an uncharged superfluid mixture, a
persistent current can be induced in the uncharged superfluid, despite the fact
that it is not directly coupled to the magnetic field. The stability analysis
shows that the induction depends on the interplay between inter-fluid
interaction and the applied magnetic field. We obtain instability boundaries of
the system and construct phase diagrams as a function of the inter-fluid
interaction and the magnetic field. We investigate these properties employing
the Bogoliubov approximation.

large number of iterations, which may render TOuU computationally expensive, if
not infeasible. To tackle this difficulty, we here propose an optimization
approach that generates a stochastic approximation of the objective,
constraints, and their gradients via a small number of adjoint (and/or forward)
solves, per iteration. A statistically independent (stochastic) approximation
of these quantities is generated at each optimization iteration. The total cost
of this approach is only a small factor larger than that of the corresponding
deterministic TO problem. We incorporate the stochastic approximation of
objective, constraints and their design sensitivities into two classes of
optimization algorithms. First, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) method and a number of its variants, which have been successfully applied
to large-scale optimization problems for machine learning. Second, we study the
use of the proposed stochastic approximation approach within conventional
nonlinear programming methods, focusing on the Globally Convergent Method of
Moving Asymptotes (GCMMA). The performance of these algorithms is investigated
with structural design optimization problems utilizing a Solid Isotropic
Material with Penalization (SIMP), as well as an explicit level set method.

that throughput can be increased by orders of magnitude, but assumed a Zipf
distribution for modeling the popularity distribution, which was based on
observations in {\em wired} networks. Thus the question whether cache-aided D2D
video distribution can provide in practice the benefits promised by existing
theoretical literature remains open. To answer this question, we provide new
results specifically for popularity distributions of video requests of mobile
users. Based on an extensive real-world dataset, we adopt a generalized
distribution, known as Mandelbrot-Zipf (MZipf) distribution. We first show that
this popularity distribution can fit the practical data well. Using this
distribution, we analyze the throughput--outage tradeoff of the cache-aided D2D
network and show that the scaling law is identical to the case of Zipf
popularity distribution when the MZipf distribution is sufficiently skewed,
implying that the benefits previously promised in the literature could indeed
be realized in practice. To support the theory, practical evaluations using
numerical experiments are provided, and show that the cache-aided D2D can
outperform the conventional unicasting from base stations.

postulate that the initial wave function started in a particular
macrostate--the special low-entropy macrostate selected by the Past Hypothesis.
Moreover, there is an additional postulate about statistical mechanical
probabilities according to which the initial wave function is a ""typical""
choice in the macrostate (the Statistical Postulate). Together, they support a
probabilistic version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics: typical initial wave
functions will increase in entropy. Hence, there are two sources of randomness
in such a universe: the quantum-mechanical probabilities of the Born rule and
the statistical mechanical probabilities of the Statistical Postulate. I
propose a new way to understand time's arrow in a quantum universe. It is based
on what I call the Thermodynamic Theories of Quantum Mechanics. According to
this perspective, there is a natural choice for the initial quantum state of
the universe, which is given by not a wave function but by a density matrix.
The initial density matrix of the universe is exactly the (normalized)
projection operator onto the Past Hypothesis subspace (of the Hilbert space of
the universe). Thus, given an initial subspace, we obtain a unique choice of
the initial density matrix. I call this property ""the conditional uniqueness""
of the initial quantum state. The conditional uniqueness provides a new and
general strategy to eliminate statistical mechanical probabilities in the
fundamental physical theories, by which we can reduce the two sources of
randomness to only the quantum mechanical one. I also explore the idea of an
""absolutely unique"" initial quantum state, in a way that might realize
Penrose's idea (1989) of a strongly deterministic universe.

In both cases the transition may be described by an an activated process, with
an activation barrier that increases as the metastable state is suppressed, as

take into account the time and energy cost of acquiring channel state

choose among three possible actions: i) deferring the transmission to save its
energy for future use, ii) transmitting without sensing, and iii) sensing the
channel before transmission. At each time slot, the transmitter chooses one of
the three possible actions to maximize the total expected discounted number of
bits transmitted over an infinite time horizon. This problem can be formulated
as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) which is then
converted to an ordinary MDP by introducing a belief on the channel state, and
the optimal policy is shown to exhibit a threshold behavior on the belief
state, with battery-dependent threshold values. Optimal threshold values and
corresponding optimal performance are characterized through numerical
simulations, and it is shown that having the sensing action and intelligently
using it to track the channel state improves the achievable long-term

For the first antenna selection scheme (AS1), where the user-antenna is

the average SER is also derived for the special case when $N_R = 1$, which is
valid for any modulation order. We show that in this case the system fails to
achieve transmit diversity in the MA phase, as the system diversity order drops
to $1$ irrespective of the number of transmit antennas at the user nodes.
Additionally, we propose a Euclidean distance (ED) based user-antenna selection
scheme (AS2) which outperforms the first scheme in terms of error performance.
Moreover, by deriving upper and lower bounds on the diversity order for the

we utilize the modified TOV equation in Einstein-$\Lambda $ gravity. Then we
drive the mass-radius relation for different values of the cosmological
constant. Our results show that for small values of the cosmological constant
($\Lambda $), especially for the cosmological constant from the cosmological
perspective $(\Lambda =10^{-52}$ $m^{-2})$, $\Lambda $ has no significant
effect on the structure of hybrid neutron stars. But for higher values, for
example, by considering $\Lambda >10^{-14}$ $m^{-2}$, this quantity affects the
maximum mass and radius of these stars. We find an upper limit for the
cosmological constant as $\Lambda <9\times 10^{-13}m^{-2}$, based on the fact
that the gravitational redshift cannot be more than $1$ for stars. The maximum
mass and radius of these stars decrease by increasing the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$. Also, by determining and analyzing radius, the compactness,
Kretschmann scalar, and gravitational red shift of the hybrid neutron stars

First, we approximate the pulse by an iterative spectral algorithm. Then, the

systems, but the right products should also be recommended at the right time to
meet the demands of users, so as to maximize their values. Users' demands,
implying strong purchase intents, can be the most useful way to promote
products sales if well utilized. Previous recommendation models mainly focused
on user's general interests to find the right products. However, the aspect of
meeting users' demands at the right time has been much less explored. To
address this problem, we propose a novel Long-Short Demands-aware Model (LSDM),
in which both user's interests towards items and user's demands over time are
incorporated. We summarize two aspects: termed as long-time demands (e.g.,
purchasing the same product repetitively showing a long-time persistent
interest) and short-time demands (e.g., co-purchase like buying paintbrushes
after pigments). To utilize such long-short demands of users, we create
different clusters to group the successive product purchases together according
to different time spans, and use recurrent neural networks to model each
sequence of clusters at a time scale. The long-short purchase demands with
multi-time scales are finally aggregated by joint learning strategies.
Experimental results on three real-world commerce datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model for next-item recommendation, showing the usefulness
of modeling users' long-short purchase demands of items with multi-time scales.

silver-silver chloride (Ag-AgCl) reference electrode with dramatically high
stability, useful in biomedical precise measurements. Low noise level and high
stability are the most important features when evaluating reference electrode
for example when used as a half-cell at electrochemical cells. The noise was
measured for bare Ag-AgCl electrode pairs in a saline electrolyte without any
junction. The noise spectral density for such measurements increases at low
frequencies due to flicker (1/f) noise. Thermal noise from the real part of the
electrode impedance is always lower than 1/f noise and is shown as offset
voltage in noise spectrum. Electrode noise is highly correlated to its offset
voltage. Moreover, the variance of the potential difference in our measurements
is correlated to the noise level of electrodes. In this paper, offset voltage
spectrum and the variance of data while doing measurements are proposed for
identification of noise in our electrodes. The results presented suggest a new
