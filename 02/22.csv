with the aim of obtaining fission observables, such as neutron and gamma
multiplicities and product yields. Key points in these calculations, which are
handled differently by the various codes, are the sharing of the total
excitation energy between the fragments and the generation of angular momenta.
After the initial states of the fragments is set, the de-excitation through the
emission of neutrons and photons can be model. However, many models also
include tunable parameters that are used to make the calculations conform with
literature data. As a result, it could be possible to obtain good agreement
with experimental results even with questionable assumptions on the initial
conditions. To test the assumptions made by different fission models the code
DE$\ell$FIN has been developed. DE$\ell$FIN starts with the fission fragments
as generated by the models and calculates the average neutron emission as a
function of mass in a transparent and coherent way using the nuclear reaction
code TALYS. Hence, the probabilities of neutron emission in competition with
$\gamma$ de-excitation comes from parameters of the TALYS code that have not
been optimised. The results are then compared looking at general trends and at
the difference to what is obtained with the stand-alone versions of the codes.
In this study, the output of DE$\ell$FIN for five of the most commonly used
fission codes is compared to the results of the stand-alone versions, and to
experimental data, for the reactions $^{235}$U(n$_{\mathrm{th}}$,f),
$^{239}$Pu(n$_{\mathrm{th}}$,f) and $^{252}$Cf(sf).

implementations of BLAS- and LAPACK-like routines for use in embedded
optimization and other applications targeting relatively small matrices.
BLASFEO defines an API which uses a packed matrix format as its native format.
This format is analogous to the internal memory buffers of optimized BLAS, but
it is exposed to the user and it removes the packing cost from the routine
call. For matrices fitting in cache, BLASFEO outperforms optimized BLAS
implementations, both open-source and proprietary. This paper investigates the
addition of a standard BLAS API to the BLASFEO framework, and proposes an
implementation switching between two or more algorithms optimized for different
matrix sizes. Thanks to the modular assembly framework in BLASFEO, tailored
linear algebra kernels with mixed column- and panel-major arguments are easily
developed. This BLAS API has lower performance than the BLASFEO API, but it
nonetheless outperforms optimized BLAS and especially LAPACK libraries for
matrices fitting in cache. Therefore, it can boost a wide range of
applications, where standard BLAS and LAPACK libraries are employed and the
matrix size is moderate. In particular, this paper investigates the benefits in
scientific programming languages such as Octave, SciPy and Julia.

conditions, producing large intra-class variations and a significant
performance drop if heterogeneous images are compared for person recognition.
However, as biometrics is deployed, it is common to replace damaged or obsolete
hardware, or to exchange information between heterogeneous applications.
Variations in spectral bands can also occur. For example, surveillance face
images (typically acquired in the visible spectrum, VIS) may need to be
compared against a legacy iris database (typically acquired in near-infrared,
NIR). Here, we propose a multialgorithmic approach to cope with periocular
images from different sensors. With face masks in the front line against
COVID-19, periocular recognition is regaining popularity since it is the only
face region that remains visible. We integrate different comparators with a
fusion scheme based on linear logistic regression, in which scores are
represented by log-likelihood ratios. This allows easy interpretation of scores
and the use of Bayes thresholds for optimal decision-making since scores from
different comparators are in the same probabilistic range. We evaluate our
approach in the context of the Cross-Eyed Competition, whose aim was to compare
recognition approaches when NIR and VIS periocular images are matched. Our
approach achieves EER=0.2% and FRR of just 0.47% at FAR=0.01%, representing the
best overall approach of the competition. Experiments are also reported with a
database of VIS images from different smartphones. We also discuss the impact
of template size and computation times, with the most computationally heavy
comparator playing an important role in the results. Lastly, the proposed
method is shown to outperform other popular fusion approaches, such as the
average of scores, SVMs or Random Forest.

test are commonly used to infer genomic positions affected by selection from
temporal changes in allele frequency. However, the null model associated with
these tests does not match the null hypothesis of actual interest. Indeed due
to genetic drift and possibly other additional noise components such as pool
sequencing, the null variance in the data can be substantially larger than
accounted forby these common test statistics. This leads to p-values that are
systematically too small and therefore a huge number of false positive results.
Even, if the ranking rather than the actual p-values is of interest, a naive
application of the mentioned tests will give misleading results, as the amount
of over-dispersion varies from locus to locus. We therefore propose adjusted
statistics that take the over-dispersion into account while keeping the
formulas simple. This is particularly useful in genome-wide applications, where
millions of SNPs can be handled with little computational effort. We then apply
the adapted test statistics to real data fromDrosophila, and investigate how

provides useful information for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.
However, automated prostate segmentation from 3D MR images still faces several
challenges. For instance, a lack of clear edge between the prostate and other
anatomical structures makes it challenging to accurately extract the
boundaries. The complex background texture and large variation in size, shape
and intensity distribution of the prostate itself make segmentation even
further complicated. With deep learning, especially convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), emerging as commonly used methods for medical image
segmentation, the difficulty in obtaining large number of annotated medical
images for training CNNs has become much more pronounced that ever before.
Since large-scale dataset is one of the critical components for the success of
deep learning, lack of sufficient training data makes it difficult to fully
train complex CNNs. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a
boundary-weighted domain adaptive neural network (BOWDA-Net). To make the
network more sensitive to the boundaries during segmentation, a
boundary-weighted segmentation loss (BWL) is proposed. Furthermore, an advanced
boundary-weighted transfer leaning approach is introduced to address the
problem of small medical imaging datasets. We evaluate our proposed model on

by tuning the initial weight variances or by adjusting the nonlinear activation
function. Indeed, batch normalization itself is the cause of gradient
explosion. As a result, vanilla batch-normalized networks without skip
connections are not trainable at large depths for common initialization
schemes, a prediction that we verify with a variety of empirical simulations.
While gradient explosion cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced by tuning the
network close to the linear regime, which improves the trainability of deep
batch-normalized networks without residual connections. Finally, we investigate
the learning dynamics of batch-normalized networks and observe that after a
single step of optimization the networks achieve a relatively stable

discriminator, playing a mini-max game. However, even if the players converge
to an equilibrium, the generator may only recover a part of the target data
distribution, in a situation commonly referred to as mode collapse. In this
work, we present the Domain Partitioning Network (DoPaNet), a new approach to
deal with mode collapse in generative adversarial learning. We employ multiple
discriminators, each encouraging the generator to cover a different part of the
target distribution. To ensure these parts do not overlap and collapse into the
same mode, we add a classifier as a third agent in the game. The classifier
decides which discriminator the generator is trained against for each sample.
Through experiments on toy examples and real images, we show the merits of
DoPaNet in covering the real distribution and its superiority with respect to
the competing methods. Besides, we also show that we can control the modes from

stars (nucleonic, hyperonic, and hybrid), using three state-of-the-art
relativistic mean field models for the microscopic description of matter, which
are in agreement with experimental and observational data. The structure of
stars is described by the general relativistic solution of both Einstein's
field equations assuming a spherical symmetry, and Einstein-Maxwell's field
equations assuming an axi-symmetric deformation. We find a limiting magnetic
moment of the order of $2\times 10^{31}$Am$^2$, which corresponds to magnetic
fields of the order of 10$^{16}$ G at the surface, and $ \sim 10^{17}$ G at the
centre of the star, above which the deformation due to the magnetic field is
not negligible. We show that the intensity of the magnetic field developed in
the star depends on the EoS, and, for a given baryonic mass and fixed magnetic
moment, larger fields are attained with softer EoS. We also show that the
appearance of exotic degrees of freedom, such as hyperons or a quark core, is
disfavored in the presence of a very strong magnetic field. As a consequence, a
highly magnetized nucleonic star may suffer an internal conversion due to the
decay of the magnetic field, which could be accompanied by a sudden cooling of
the star or a gamma ray burst.

and space advantages over high precision alternatives, but need to overcome the
challenge of maintaining high accuracy as precision decreases. Here, we present
a method for training such networks, Learned Step Size Quantization, that
achieves the highest accuracy to date on the ImageNet dataset when using
models, from a variety of architectures, with weights and activations quantized
to 2-, 3- or 4-bits of precision, and that can train 3-bit models that reach
full precision baseline accuracy. Our approach builds upon existing methods for
learning weights in quantized networks by improving how the quantizer itself is
configured. Specifically, we introduce a novel means to estimate and scale the
task loss gradient at each weight and activation layer's quantizer step size,
such that it can be learned in conjunction with other network parameters. This
approach works using different levels of precision as needed for a given system
and requires only a simple modification of existing training code.

quantum chemistry specially designed for wave function methods. Its main goal
is the development of determinant-driven selected configuration interaction
(sCI) methods and multi-reference second-order perturbation theory (PT2). The
determinant-driven framework allows the programmer to include any arbitrary set
of determinants in the reference space, hence providing greater methodological
freedoms. The sCI method implemented in \textsc{Quantum Package} is based on
the CIPSI (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made
Iteratively) algorithm which complements the variational sCI energy with a PT2
correction. Additional external plugins have been recently added to perform
calculations with multireference coupled cluster theory and range-separated
density-functional theory. All the programs are developed with the IRPF90 code
generator, which simplifies collaborative work and the development of new
features. \textsc{Quantum Package} strives to allow easy implementation and
experimentation of new methods, while making parallel computation as simple and
efficient as possible on modern supercomputer architectures. Currently, the
code enables, routinely, to realize runs on roughly 2\,000 CPU cores, with tens
of millions of determinants in the reference space. Moreover, we have been able
to push up to 12\,288 cores in order to test its parallel efficiency. In the
present manuscript, we also introduce some key new developments: i) a
renormalized second-order perturbative correction for efficient extrapolation
to the full CI limit, and ii) a stochastic version of the CIPSI selection
performed simultaneously to the PT2 calculation at no extra cost.

the location area of the CS candidate (CSc-1), which was declared in a previous
work by CMB analysis. Using photometric and geometric criteria, we identified
pairs of candidates of lensed galaxies (LGCs) in the ""string field"" (SF), which
were then compared with the average density of background galaxy pairs in a set
of ""control fields"" (CFs). We found an excess of $22\%$ (per sq. deg.) of the
LGCs in SF, which exceeds the estimated cosmic dispersion. We also found that
the number of LGCs is in excess of $29.2\%$ in the angular separation bin
$[8'', 9'']$. Finally, we analysed the possibility of a preferred orientation
of the line connecting the centres of the LGCs. The orientation is
statistically significant for an angular separation bin $[4'',6'']$. Therefore,
we found two ""windows"" for the preferred angular separation for LGCs along the
possible CS. However, the confirmation of the gravitational lensing origin of
our LGCs requires spectroscopic observations which seem to be justified by the
present results. We plan to acquire their spectra as well as to continue the
study of the spectral and morphological features of the LGCs in the CSc-1 field

expressed as a power series in terms of a small expansion parameter. For
non-perturbative systems, for instance nuclear physics, this requires the
non-perturbative treatment of at least a part of the interaction (or the
potential, if we are dealing with a non-relativistic system). This is not
entirely trivial and as a consequence different interpretations on how to treat
these systems have appeared. A practical approach is to expand the effective
potential, where this potential is later fully iterated in the Schr\""odinger
equation for obtaining amplitudes and observables. The expectation is that this
will lead to observables that will have an implicit power counting expansion.
Here we explicitly check whether the amplitudes are actually following the same
power counting as the potential. It happens that reality does not necessarily
conform to expectations and the amplitudes will often violate the power
counting with which the potential has been expanded. A more formal approach is
to formulate the expansion directly in terms of amplitudes and observables,
which is the original aim of the effective field theory idea. Yet this second
approach is technically complicated. We explore here the possibility of
constructing potentials that when fully iterated will make sure that amplitudes

consider the entanglement breaking index, that is, the number of times a
quantum channel has to be composed with itself before it becomes entanglement
breaking. The PPT-square conjecture is that every PPT quantum channel has an
entanglement breaking index of at most 2; we prove that every faithful PPT
quantum channel has a finite entanglement breaking index, and more generally,
any faithful PPT CP map whose Hilbert-Schmidt adjoint is also faithful is
eventually entanglement breaking. We also provide a method to obtain concrete
bounds on this index for any faithful quantum channel. To obtain these
estimates, we use a notion of robustness of separability to obtain bounds on
the radius of the largest separable ball around faithful product states. We
also extend the framework of Poincar\'e inequalities for nonprimitive
semigroups to the discrete setting to quantify the convergence of quantum
semigroups in discrete time, which is of independent interest.

equations, the mean-field level, and a perturbative solution to the
Fokker-Planck equation that works particularly well for small oscillation
amplitudes. We provide consistent derivations of the laws of thermodynamics for
this model system at each of these levels. At the mean-field level, an abrupt
transition to self-oscillation arises from a Hopf bifurcation of the
deterministic equations of motion. At the stochastic level, this transition is
smeared out by noise, but vestiges of the bifurcation remain visible in the
stationary probability density. At all levels of description, the transition
towards self-oscillation is reflected in thermodynamic quantities such as heat
flow, work and entropy production rate. Our analysis provides a comprehensive
picture of a nano-scale self-oscillating system, with stochastic and

properties of classical or rate-independent hysteresis models are known, this
is not the case for dynamic models where current approaches lack a proper
functional analytic framework which is essential to formulate optimization
problems and develop stable numerics, both being crucial in practice. This
paper deals with the description and mathematical analysis of the dynamic
Preisach hysteresis model. Toward that end, we complete a widely accepted
definition of the dynamic model commonly used to describe the constitutive
relation between the magnetic field H and the magnetic induction B, in which,
the values of B not only depends on the present values of H but also on the
past history and its velocity. We first analyze mathematically some important
properties of the model and compare them with known results for the static
Preisach model. Then, we consider a parabolic problem with dynamic hysteresis
motivated by electromagnetic field equations. Under suitable assumptions, we
show the well posedness of a weak formulation of the problem and solve it
numerically.
  Finally, we report a numerical test in order to assess the order of
convergence and to illustrate the behavior of the numerical solution for
different configurations of the dynamic Preisach model

problem derives from applications in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and
optimization where, rather than obtaining all the observations at once, one
constantly acquires new data, and must continuously update the distribution.
Our main result is an algorithm that generates roughly independent samples from
$\pi_t$ for every epoch $t$ and, under mild assumptions, makes
$\mathrm{polylog}(T)$ gradient evaluations per epoch. All previous results
imply a bound on the number of gradient or function evaluations which is at
least linear in $T$. Motivated by real-world applications, we assume that
functions are smooth, their associated distributions have a bounded second
moment, and their minimizer drifts in a bounded manner, but do not assume they
are strongly convex. In particular, our assumptions hold for online Bayesian
logistic regression, when the data satisfy natural regularity properties,
giving a sampling algorithm with updates that are poly-logarithmic in $T$. In
simulations, our algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to an algorithm
specialized to logistic regression. Key to our algorithm is a novel stochastic
gradient Langevin dynamics Markov chain with a carefully designed variance
reduction step and constant batch size. Technically, lack of strong convexity
is a significant barrier to analysis and, here, our main contribution is a
martingale exit time argument that shows our Markov chain remains in a ball of
radius roughly poly-logarithmic in $T$ for enough time to reach within
$\varepsilon$ of $\pi_t$.

by GWs can easily cause the event horizon to form out of a static ECO ---
leaving no echo signals towards spatial infinity. To show this, we use the
ingoing Vaidya spacetime and take into account the back reaction due to
incoming GWs. Demanding that an ECO does not collapse into a black hole puts an
upper bound on the compactness of the ECO, at the cost of less distinct echo
signals for smaller compactness. The trade-off between echoes' detectability
and distinguishability leads to a fine tuning of ECO parameters for LIGO to
find distinct echoes. We also show that an extremely compact ECO that can
survive the gravitational collapse and give rise to GW echoes might have to
expand its surface in a non-causal way.

study how distinct allocation policies affect the performance of a group of
agents whose task is to find the global maxima of NK fitness landscapes. Agents
cooperate by broadcasting messages informing on their fitness and use this
information to imitate the fittest agent in their influence neighborhoods. The
larger the influence neighborhood of an agent, the more links, and hence
information, the agent receives. We find that the elitist policy in which
agents with above-average fitness have their influence neighborhoods amplified,
whereas agents with below-average fitness have theirs deflated, is optimal for
smooth landscapes, provided the group size is not too small. For rugged
landscapes, however, the elitist policy can perform very poorly for certain
group sizes. In addition, we find that the egalitarian policy, in which the
size of the influence neighborhood is the same for all agents, is optimal for
both smooth and rugged landscapes in the case of small groups. The welfarist
policy, in which the actions of the elitist policy are reversed, is always
suboptimal, i.e., depending on the group size it is outperformed by either the
elitist or the egalitarian policies.

how the addition of a single theory-motivated constraint removes an oscillation

includes 7 objects that are catalogued as dynamically evolved open clusters. We
used photometric data from the 2MASS, astrometric data from the GAIA DR2 and a
decontamination algorithm that was applied to the three-dimensional astrometric
space of proper motions and parallaxes for stars in the objects' areas. The
luminosity and mass functions and total masses for most open cluster remnants
are derived here for the first time. Our analysis used predictions of N-body
simulations to estimate the initial number of stars of the remnants from their
dissolution timescales. The investigated open cluster remnants present masses
and velocity dispersions within well-defined ranges: M between ~10-40M_Sun and
sigma_v between ~1-7km/s. Some objects in the remnant sample have a limiting
radius R_lim<~2pc, which means that they are more compact than the investigated
open clusters; other remnants have R_lim between ~2-7pc, which is comparable to
the open clusters. We suggest that the open cluster NGC2180 is entering a
remnant evolutionary stage. In general, our clusters show signals of depletion
of low-mass stars. This confirms their dynamically evolved states. We conclude
that the open cluster remnants we studied are in fact remnants of initially
very populous open clusters (No~10^3-10^4 stars). The outcome of the long-term
evolution is to bring the final residues of the open clusters to dynamical
states that are similar to each other, thus masking out the memory of the
initial formation conditions of star clusters.

locating the global minimum of some cost function. Optimization is
traditionally automated with digital or quantum computers, each having their
limitations and none guaranteeing an optimal solution. Here, we conceive a
principle behind optimization based on delay-induced bifurcations, which is
potentially implementable in non-quantum analog devices. Often, optimization
techniques are interpreted via a particle moving in multi-well energy landscape
and to prevent confinement to a non-global minima they should incorporate
mechanisms to overcome barriers between the minima. Particularly, simulated
annealing digitally emulates pushing a fictitious particle over a barrier by
random noise, whereas quantum computers utilize tunneling through barriers. In
our principle, the barriers are effectively destroyed by delay-induced
bifurcations. Although bifurcation scenarios in nonlinear delay-differential
equations can be very complex and are notoriously difficult to predict, we
hypothesize, verify, and utilize the finding that they become considerably more
predictable in dynamical systems, where the right-hand side depends only on the
delayed variable and represents a gradient of some potential energy function.
By tuning the delay introduced into the gradient descent setting, thanks to
global bifurcations destroying local attractors, one could force the system to
spontaneously wander around all minima. This would be similar to noise-induced
behavior in simulated annealing but achieved deterministically. Ideally, a slow
increase and then decrease of the delay should automatically push the system
toward the global minimum. We explore the possibility of this scenario and
formulate some prerequisites.

asymptotically-flat in the sense of Ashtekar and Hansen. Using a cylindrical
3-manifold of both null and spatial directions of approach towards spatial
infinity, we impose appropriate regularity conditions on the Weyl tensor near
spatial infinity along null directions. The asymptotic Einstein equations on
this 3-manifold and the regularity conditions imply that the relevant Weyl
tensor components on past null infinity are antipodally matched to those on
future null infinity. The subalgebra of totally fluxless supertranslations near
spatial infinity provides a natural isomorphism between the
BMS-supertranslations on past and future null infinity. This proves that the
flux of the supermomenta is conserved from past to future null infinity in a
classical gravitational scattering process provided additional suitable
conditions are satisfied at the timelike infinities.

history. Grouping stars based on their similar chemistry can establish details
of the star formation and merger history of the Milky Way. With precise
measurements of stellar chemistry, chemical tagging may be able to group
together stars born from the same gas cloud, regardless of their current
positions and kinematics. Successfully tagging these birth clusters requires
high quality chemical space information and a good cluster-finding algorithm.
To test the feasibility of chemical tagging on data from current and upcoming
spectroscopic surveys, we construct a realistic set of synthetic clusters,
creating both observed spectra and derived chemical abundances for each star.
We use Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to
group stars based on their spectra or abundances; these groups are matched to
input clusters and are found to be highly homogeneous and complete. The
percentage of clusters with more than 10 members recovered is 40% when tagging
on abundances with uncertainties achievable with current techniques. Based on
our fiducial model for the Milky Way, we predict recovering over 600 clusters
with at least 10 observed members and 70% membership homogeneity in a sample
similar to the APOGEE survey. Tagging larger surveys like the GALAH survey and
the future Milky Way Mapper in SDSS V could recover tens of thousands of
clusters at high homogeneity. Access to so many unique co-eval clusters will
transform how we understand the star formation history and chemical evolution
of our Galaxy.

gravitational forces in a tidal disruption event (TDE). The flares produced by
TDEs are unique tracers of otherwise quiescent supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
located at the centre of most galaxies. In particular, the appearance of such
flares and the subsequent decay of the light curve are both sensitive to
whether the star is partially or totally destroyed by the tidal field. However,
the physics of the disruption and the fall-back of the debris are still poorly
understood. We are here modelling the hydrodynamical evolution of realistic
stars as they approach a SMBH on parabolic orbits, using for the first time the
moving-mesh code AREPO, which is particularly well adapted to the problem
through its combination of quasi-Lagrangian behaviour, low advection errors,
and high accuracy typical of mesh-based techniques. We examine a suite of
simulations with different impact parameters, allowing us to determine the
critical distance at which the star is totally disrupted, the energy
distribution and the fallback rate of the debris, as well as the hydrodynamical
evolution of the stellar remnant in the case of a partial disruption.
Interestingly, we find that the internal evolution of the remnant's core is
strongly influenced by persistent vortices excited in the tidal interaction.
These should be sites of strong magnetic field amplification, and the
associated mixing may profoundly alter the subsequent evolution of the tidally
pruned star.

identified a new source class -- TeV halos -- powered by the interactions of
high-energy electrons and positrons that have escaped from the PWN, but which
remain trapped in a larger region where diffusion is inhibited compared to the
interstellar medium. Many theoretical properties of TeV halos remain
mysterious, but empirical arguments suggest that they are ubiquitous. The key
to progress is finding more halos. We outline prospects for new discoveries and
calculate their expectations and uncertainties. We predict, using models
normalized to current data, that future HAWC and CTA observations will detect
in total $\sim$50--240 TeV halos, though we note that multiple systematic
uncertainties still exist. Further, the existing HESS source catalog could
contain $\sim$10--50 TeV halos that are presently classified as unidentified

new probes of the evolution of TeV halos, pulsar properties, and the sources of
high-energy gamma rays and cosmic rays.

similar mass dwarf galaxies. In the COS sample, eight GPs show Ly$\alpha$
absorption components, six of which also have Ly$\alpha$ emission. The HI
column densities derived from Ly$\alpha$ absorption are high, $\log

low-ionization absorption lines, we measure covering fractions

anti-correlates with Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction. Low covering fractions may
facilitate Ly$\alpha$ and LyC escape through dense neutral regions. GPs with

$f_{\mbox{cov}}=0.2-0.6$ have a larger range of velocities. Conventional

whereas other processes may be important for GPs with low velocities. Finally,

photon escape likely depends on a combination of neutral gas geometry and

electron distribution is solved from a generalized transport equation that
contains the terms describing first-order and secondary-order \emph{Fermi}

advection process tends to harden the particle distribution, which enhances the
high energy components of resulting synchrotron and synchrotron self-Comptom

stability of autonomous dynamical systems in classical mechanics, using
symplectic geometry. We then discuss what the phase space and the Hamiltonian
of general relativity are, what constitutes a dynamical system, and
subsequently draw a formal analogy between the notions of stability in these
two theories. Our approach here is pedagogical and geometric, and considerably
simplifies a formal understanding of the statements regarding the stability of
stationary solutions of general relativity. In particular, the governing
equations of motion of a Hamiltonian dynamical system are simply the flow
equations of the associated symplectic Hamiltonian vector field, defined on
phase space, and the non-linear stability analysis of its critical points have
simply to do with the divergence of its flow there. Further, the linear
stability of a critical point is related to the properties of the tangent flow
of the Hamiltonian vector field. Further, we posit that a study of the
genericity of a particular black hole or naked singularity spacetime forming as
an endstate of gravitational collapse is equivalent to an inquiry of how
sensitive the orbits of the symplectic Hamiltonian vector field of general
relativity are to changes in initial data. We demonstrate this by conducting a
restricted non-linear stability analysis of the formation of a Schwarzschild
black hole, working in the usual initial value formulation of general
relativity.

Asteroseismic measurements of red giant stars reveal that their cores rotate

cores. Motivated by this, we investigate the magnetic Tayler instability and
argue that it saturates when turbulent dissipation of the perturbed magnetic

larger magnetic field amplitudes, more efficient AM transport, and smaller
shears than predicted by the classic Tayler-Spruit dynamo. We provide
prescriptions for the effective AM diffusivity and incorporate them into
numerical stellar models, finding they largely reproduce (1) the nearly rigid
rotation of the Sun and main sequence stars, (2) the core rotation rates of

solutions to these limitations. Our methods are based on the distribution of
the effect sizes of the population of trials of interest. The estimation of
this distribution is practically feasible as clinicaltrials.gov provides a

  Temperature",,,"10.1002/qj.3587",,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We use a simple, semi-analytic, column model to better understand the
meridional structure of the tropopause height and the future changes in its
height and temperature associated with global warming. The model allows us to
separate the effects of tropospheric lapse rate (TLR), optical depth, outgoing
longwave radiation (OLR) and stratospheric cooling on the tropopause height.
When applied locally at each latitudinal band the model predicts the overall
meridional structure of the tropopause height, with a tropical tropopause
substantially higher than that in higher latitudes and a sharp transition at
the edge of the extratropics. The large optical depth of the tropics, due
mainly to the large water vapour path (WVP), is the dominant tropospheric
effect producing the higher tropical tropopause, whereas the larger tropical
lapse rate acts to lower the tropopause height. The dynamical cooling induced
by the stratospheric circulation further lifts the thermal tropopause in the
tropics resulting in it being significantly cooler and higher than in mid- and
high latitudes. The model quantifies the causes of the tropopause height
increase with global warming that is robustly found in climate integrations
from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The large spread
in the increase rate of tropopause height in the CMIP5 models is captured by
the simple model, which attributes the dominant contributions to changes in WVP
and TLR, with changes in CO2 concentration and OLR having much smaller effects.
The CMIP5 models also show a small but robust increase in the tropopause
temperature in low latitudes, with a much smaller increase in higher latitudes.
We suggest that the tropical increase may in part be caused by non-grey effects
in the radiative transfer associated with the higher levels of water vapour in
the tropics, with near constant tropopause temperatures predicted otherwise.

largely inspired applying SOT to \emph{multi-object tracking} (MOT) to improve
the robustness as well as relieving dependency on external detector. However,
SOT algorithms are generally designed for distinguishing a target from its
environment, and hence meet problems when a target is spatially mixed with
similar objects as observed frequently in MOT. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose an instance-aware tracker to integrate SOT techniques for MOT
by encoding awareness both within and between target models. In particular, we
construct each target model by fusing information for distinguishing target
both from background and other instances (tracking targets). To conserve
uniqueness of all target models, our instance-aware tracker considers response
maps from all target models and assigns spatial locations exclusively to
optimize the overall accuracy. Another contribution we make is a dynamic model
refreshing strategy learned by a convolutional neural network. This strategy
helps to eliminate initialization noise as well as to adapt to the variation of
target size and appearance. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
it is evaluated on the popular MOT15 and MOT16 challenge benchmarks. On both
benchmarks, our approach achieves the best overall performances in comparison

Our interest lies in understanding the accumulation of particles including the

hydrodynamic effects: the tortuous paths of the porous medium generate regions
of dominating strain/vorticity, which favour the accumulation/dispersion of the
inertial particles. Numerical simulations show that essentially two
accumulation regimes are identified: for low and for high flow velocities. When
particles accumulate in high-velocity regions, at the entrance of a pore
throat, a clog is formed. The formation of a clog significantly modifies the
flow, as the partial blockage of the pore causes a local redistribution of
pressure. This redistribution can divert the upstream water flow into
neighbouring pores. Moreover, we show that accumulation in high velocity
regions occurs in heterogeneous media, but not in homogeneous media, where we
refer to homogeneity with respect to the distribution of the pore throat
diameters.

The same remains true in more general constraint satisfaction problems with

carefully choosing the cost function to be minimized, the region of criticality
extends to occupy a whole region of the jammed phase. As a working example, we

important. In addition to improved RFI identification, we must also take into

precisely reflect the underlying patient across the course of the condition's
progression holds a unique value, like facilitating a range of clinical
decision-making opportunities. This is particularly important for monitoring
degenerative condition such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), where the condition of
the patient will decay over time. Detecting early symptoms and progression
sign, and continuous severity evaluation, are all essential for disease
management. While a few methods have been developed in the literature,
uncertainty quantification of those health index models has been largely
neglected. To ensure the continuity of the care, we should be more explicit
about the level of confidence in model outputs. Ideally, decision-makers should
be provided with recommendations that are robust in the face of substantial
uncertainty about future outcomes. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by
developing an uncertainty quantification based contemporaneous longitudinal
index, named UQ-CHI, with a particular focus on continuous patient monitoring
of degenerative conditions. Our method is to combine convex optimization and
Bayesian learning using the maximum entropy learning (MEL) framework,
integrating uncertainty on labels as well. Our methodology also provides
closed-form solutions in some important decision making tasks, e.g., such as
predicting the label of a new sample. Numerical studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of the propose UQ-CHI method in prediction accuracy, monitoring
efficacy, and unique advantages if uncertainty quantification is enabled
practice.

an ambient fluid accounting for heat and mass transfer with the aim of studying
in a meteorological context the case of falling graupel in humid air. The study
is motivated by the fact that falling graupels in clouds are heated by the
latent heat released during the accretion of liquid water droplets. They may
therefore be considerably warmer than their surrounding and evaporate water
vapor, which mixes with the surrounding air in the wake of the graupel, thereby
creating transient zones of supersaturation there. The problem of a falling
graupel is modeled as that of a heated sphere falling in a quiescent ambient
fluid under the action of gravity. The coupling between the temperature and
velocity fields is accounted for by the Boussinesq approximation. This problem
can be parameterized by four parameters: the particle/fluid density ratio, the
Galileo number, the Prandtl number, and the Richardson number. A separate
scalar transport equation accounts for the vapor transport. Typical cloud
conditions involve small temperature differences between the sphere and the
surrounding, yielding relatively small Richardson numbers for both heat and
mass transport. We give a special emphasis to the Galileo numbers 150, 170, 200
and 300 in order to analyze the specificities of each settling regime. The
questions addressed in this study are mainly methodological and concern the
influence of the settling regime and the mobility of the sphere on the
structure of the scalar fields, the possible influence of modest Richardson
numbers on the structure of the wake, and the possible application of this
simulation framework to the investigation of the saturation in the wake of a
falling graupel.

from MD and BTE show an apparent, satisfactory agreement; however such an
agreement is the result of error cancellations. We also show that the primary
effect of statistics on thermal conductivity is via the scattering rate

specific problems, but there is no straight-forward way to combine pretrained
models for new problems. Here, we explore improving modularity by learning a
post-hoc interface between two existing models to solve a new task.
Specifically, we take inspiration from neural machine translation, and cast the
challenging problem of cross-modal domain transfer as unsupervised translation
between the latent spaces of pretrained deep generative models. By abstracting
away the data representation, we demonstrate that it is possible to transfer
across different modalities (e.g., image-to-audio) and even different types of
generative models (e.g., VAE-to-GAN). We compare to state-of-the-art techniques
and find that a straight-forward variational autoencoder is able to best bridge
the two generative models through learning a shared latent space. We can
further impose supervised alignment of attributes in both domains with a
classifier in the shared latent space. Through qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that locality and semantic alignment are preserved
through the transfer process, as indicated by high transfer accuracies and
smooth interpolations within a class. Finally, we show this modular structure
speeds up training of new interface models by several orders of magnitude by
decoupling it from expensive retraining of base generative models.

the map properties and the allowed neighbourhood where a solution can start to

the pairwise distances in the input graph up to a small multiplicative stretch.
The common objective in the computation of spanners is to achieve the
best-known existential size-stretch trade-off efficiently.
  Classical models and algorithmic analysis of graph spanners essentially
assume that the algorithm can read the input graph, construct the desired
spanner, and write the answer to the output tape. However, when considering
massive graphs containing millions or even billions of nodes not only the input
graph, but also the output spanner might be too large for a single processor to
store.
  To tackle this challenge, we initiate the study of local computation
algorithms (LCAs) for graph spanners in general graphs, where the algorithm
should locally decide whether a given edge $(u,v) \in E$ belongs to the output
spanner. Such LCAs give the user the `illusion' that a specific sparse spanner
for the graph is maintained, without ever fully computing it. We present the
following results:
  -For general $n$-vertex graphs and $r \in \{2,3\}$, there exists an LCA for
$(2r-1)$-spanners with $\widetilde{O}(n^{1+1/r})$ edges and sublinear probe
complexity of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/2r})$. These size/stretch tradeoffs are
best possible (up to polylogarithmic factors).
  -For every $k \geq 1$ and $n$-vertex graph with maximum degree $\Delta$,
there exists an LCA for $O(k^2)$ spanners with $\widetilde{O}(n^{1+1/k})$
edges, probe complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\Delta^4 n^{2/3})$, and random seed
of size $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$. This improves upon, and extends the work of
[Lenzen-Levi, 2018].
  We also complement our results by providing a polynomial lower bound on the
probe complexity of LCAs for graph spanners that holds even for the simpler
task of computing a sparse connected subgraph with $o(m)$ edges.

Microwave Background are two important handles on the gas content of the
Universe. The cross-correlation between these effects eliminates noise bias and
reduces observational systematic effects. Using analytic models for the cluster
profile, we develop a halo model formalism to study this cross-correlation and
apply it to forecast the signal-to-noise of upcoming measurements from eROSITA
and the Simons Observatory. In the soft X-ray band (0.5--2 keV), we forecast a
signal-to-noise of 174 for the cross-power spectrum. Over a wide range of the
scales, the X-rays will be signal-dominated, and so sample variance is
important. In particular, non-Gaussian (4-point) contributions to the errors
highlight the utility of masking massive clusters. Masking clusters down to
$10^{14}\ M_\odot$ increases the signal-to-noise of the cross-spectrum to 201.
We perform a Fisher Analysis on the fitting coefficients of the Battaglia et
al. gas profiles and on cosmological parameters. We find that the cross
spectrum is most sensitive to the overall scale of the profiles of pressure and
electron density, as well as cosmological parameters $\sigma_8$ and $H_0$, but
that the large number of parameters form a degenerate set, which makes
extracting the information more challenging. Our modeling framework is
flexible, and in the future, we can easily extend it to forecast the spatial
cross-correlations of surveys of X-ray lines available to
high-energy-resolution microcalorimetry, to studies of the Warm-Hot
Intergalactic Medium, and other effects.

such as the stress annihilation at some points along the boundary of elliptical

sufficient conditions to construct flat outputs as a set of independent first

namely in a neighborhood of a point where the $n-1$ control vector fields are
independent, and the second one at a degenerate point where $p-1$ control

Depending on their brightness, the properties of the plasmas heated by the SNR

precede that of galaxies. However, some of the most intriguing candidate active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in small galaxies have such low luminosities that the
sample is vulnerable to contamination by other sources, such as supernova
remnants. We re-analysed Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of candidate
AGN in Henize 2-10 and NGC 4178, considering the potential signals of emission
lines in the minimally-binned X-ray spectra. We find that hot plasma models,
which are typical of supernova remnants, explain the observed spectra much
better than simple power-law models, which are appropriate for AGN. We identify
clear signals of X-ray lines in the faint X-ray source identified with the
radio source in Henize 2-10 by Reines et al. 2016. Combining our work with the
MUSE measurement of the ionization parameter in this region by Cresci et al.
2017 indicates that this radio and X-ray source is more likely a supernova
remnant than an AGN. A similar analysis of the low-count X-ray spectrum of a
candidate AGN in NGC 4178 shows that a hot plasma model is about seventeen
times more probable than a simple power-law model. Our results indicate that
investigation of X-ray spectra, even in a low-count regime, can be a crucial

simultaneously. This class of problems can be used to formulate a wide range of
signal processing and communication (SPCOM) problems. Despite its popularity,
most existing theory for this class has been mainly developed for problems with
certain special convex-concave structure. Therefore, it cannot be used to guide
the algorithm design for many interesting problems in SPCOM, where various
kinds of non-convexity arise.
  In this work, we consider a block-wise one-sided non-convex min-max problem,
in which the minimization problem consists of multiple blocks and is
non-convex, while the maximization problem is (strongly) concave. We propose a

show that HiBSA converges to some properly defined first-order stationary
solutions with quantifiable global rates. To validate the efficiency of the

deals in determine whether regularity of the initial data on the right hand

This property was found originally in solutions of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)
equation and it has been also verified in other dispersive equations as the
Benjamin-Ono (BO) equation.
  Recently, it has been shown that the solutions of the dispersive generalized

also satisfy the propagation of regularity phenomena. This is achieved by
introducing a commutator decomposition to handle the dispersive part in the

multi-step gradient descent-ascent algorithm finds an \varepsilon--first order

reduction methods for parameterized partial differential equations. The key
concept of localized model order reduction is to construct local reduced spaces
that have only support on part of the domain and compute a global approximation
by a suitable coupling of the local spaces. In detail, we show how optimal
local approximation spaces can be constructed and approximated by random
sampling. An overview of possible conforming and non-conforming couplings of
the local spaces is provided and corresponding localized a posteriori error

includes a discussion of adaptivity. Implementational aspects of localized
model reduction methods are addressed. Finally, we illustrate the presented
concepts for multiscale, linear elasticity and fluid-flow problems, providing
several numerical experiments.

TESS mission, the runaway star PHL 346 = HN Aqr. The star, previously known as
a singly-periodic pulsator, has at least 34 oscillation modes excited, 12 of
those in the g-mode domain and 22 p modes. Analysis of archival data implies
that the amplitude and frequency of the dominant mode and the stellar radial
velocity were variable over time. A binary nature would be inconsistent with
the inferred ejection velocity from the Galactic disc of 420 km/s, which is too
large to be survivable by a runaway binary system. A kinematic analysis of the
star results in an age constraint (23 +- 1 Myr) that can be imposed on
asteroseismic modelling and that can be used to remove degeneracies in the
modelling process. Our attempts to match the excitation of the observed
frequency spectrum resulted in pulsation models that were too young. Hence,
asteroseismic studies of runaway pulsators can become vital not only in tracing
the evolutionary history of such objects, but to understand the interior
structure of massive stars in general. TESS is now opening up these stars for
detailed asteroseismic investigation.

The question raised generalizes the classical Schrodinger Bridge Problem (SBP)
which seeks to interpolate two specified end-point marginal distributions of
overdamped particles driven by stochastic excitation. While we restrict our
analysis to second-order dynamics for the particles, the data represents
partial (i.e., only positional) information on the flow at {\em multiple}
time-points. The solution sought, as in SBP, represents a probability law on
the space of paths this closest to a uniform prior while consistent with the
given marginals. We approach this problem as an optimal control problem to
minimize an action integral a la Benamou-Brenier, and derive a time-symmetric
formulation that includes a Fisher information term on the velocity field. We
underscore the relation of our problem to recent measure-valued splines in
Wasserstein space, which is akin to that between SBP and Optimal Mass Transport
(OMT). The connection between the two provides a Sinkhorn-like approach to
computing measure-valued splines. We envision that interpolation between

predicting a wide variety of processes. One of the difficulties with modeling
spatial processes that change in time is the complexity of the dependence
structures that must describe how such a process varies, and the presence of
high-dimensional complex data sets and large prediction domains. It is
particularly challenging to specify parameterizations for nonlinear dynamic
spatio-temporal models (DSTMs) that are simultaneously useful scientifically
and efficient computationally. Statisticians have developed deep hierarchical
models that can accommodate process complexity as well as the uncertainties in
the predictions and inference. However, these models can be expensive and are
typically application specific. On the other hand, the machine learning
community has developed alternative ""deep learning"" approaches for nonlinear
spatio-temporal modeling. These models are flexible yet are typically not
implemented in a probabilistic framework. The two paradigms have many things in
common and suggest hybrid approaches that can benefit from elements of each
framework. This overview paper presents a brief introduction to the deep
hierarchical DSTM (DH-DSTM) framework, and deep models in machine learning,
culminating with the deep neural DSTM (DN-DSTM). Recent approaches that combine
elements from DH-DSTMs and echo state network DN-DSTMs are presented as

The spiral arms are regions of actively forming new stars dominated by young
stars, dust and gas. Dust and gas are primary materials for the formation of
new stars. This dust is also responsible for the reddish appearance of the
stars since it absorbs more blue light than red. Besides the disk, there are
numerous older stars, which appear white in color according to the picture by

exhibit a ratio of optical depth of H2O ice to silicate dust (tau3.0/tau9.7)
that is lower than that in the Taurus dark cloud. This implies that ULIRGs
cannot be described as an ensemble of low-mass star-forming regions and that a
significant amount of high-mass star-forming regions contribute to star-forming
clouds in local ULIRGs. The results also show that the ratios of optical depth
of aliphatic carbon to silicate dust, tau3.4/tau9.7, exhibit diverse values. We
investigate two effects that can affect this ratio: the geometric temperature
gradient (which increases the ratio) and the intense UV environment (which
decreases it). The geometric temperature gradient is typically considered as a
sign of active galactic nuclei (AGN). ULIRGs with AGN signs (optical
classification, NIR color, and a PAH emission strength of 3.3 um) indeed tend
to exhibit a large tau3.4/tau9.7 ratio. However, we find that the presence of
buried AGN is not the only cause of the geometric temperature gradient, because
the enhancement of the ratio is also evident in pure starburst-like ULIRGs
without these AGN signs. Regarding the intense UV environment in star-forming
regions, the correlation between the aliphatic carbon ratio and the ratio of
the [C II] 158 um line luminosity to the far-infrared luminosity (L[CII]/LFIR),
which represents the UV environment in photodissociation regions, implies that
the intense UV environment causes the decrease of the aliphatic carbon ratio.
We find that an intense UV environment (G/nH > 3) in star-forming regions is
needed for the aliphatic carbon ratio to be suppressed.

always evolve over time with the occurrence and vanishing of nodes and links.
Dynamic network link prediction thus has been attracting more and more
attention since it can better capture the evolution nature of networks, but
still most algorithms fail to achieve satisfied prediction accuracy. Motivated
by the excellent performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in processing
time series, in this paper, we propose a novel Encoder-LSTM-Decoder (E-LSTM-D)
deep learning model to predict dynamic links end to end. It could handle long
term prediction problems, and suits the networks of different scales with
fine-tuned structure. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that
LSTM, together with an encoder-decoder architecture, is applied to link
prediction in dynamic networks. This new model is able to automatically learn
structural and temporal features in a unified framework, which can predict the
links that never appear in the network before. The extensive experiments show
that our E-LSTM-D model significantly outperforms newly proposed dynamic
network link prediction methods and obtain the state-of-the-art results.

fraction of accretion material converted to radiative energy for accretion onto
massive black holes (MBHs). With the simplest So{\l}tan argument, the radiative
efficiency of MBHs can be estimated by matching the mass density of MBHs in the
local universe to the accreted mass density by MBHs during AGN/QSO phases. In
this paper, we estimate the local MBH mass density through a combination of
various determinations of the correlations between the masses of MBHs and the
properties of MBH host galaxies, with the distribution functions of those
galaxy properties. We also estimate the total energy density radiated by AGNs
and QSOs by using various AGN/QSO X-ray luminosity functions in the literature.
We then obtain several hundred estimates of the mean radiative efficiency of
AGNs/QSOs. Under the assumption that those estimates are independent of each
other and free of systematic effects, we apply the median statistics as
described by Gott et al.\cite{got01} and find the mean radiative efficiency of
AGNs/QSOs is $\epsilon=0.105^{+0.006}_{-0.008}$, which is consistent with the
canonical value $\sim0.1$. Considering that about $20\%$ Compton-thick objects
may be missed from current available X-ray surveys, the true mean radiative

literature largely focused on understanding and mitigating the vulnerability of

the most popular robust training method in the literature, adversarial
training: Adversarial robustness, unlike clean accuracy, is sensitive to the
input data distribution. Even a semantics-preserving transformations on the
input data distribution can cause a significantly different robustness for the
adversarial trained model that is both trained and evaluated on the new
distribution. Our discovery of such sensitivity on data distribution is based
on a study which disentangles the behaviors of clean accuracy and robust
accuracy of the Bayes classifier. Empirical investigations further confirm our
finding. We construct semantically-identical variants for MNIST and CIFAR10
respectively, and show that standardly trained models achieve comparable clean
accuracies on them, but adversarially trained models achieve significantly
different robustness accuracies. This counter-intuitive phenomenon indicates
that input data distribution alone can affect the adversarial robustness of
trained neural networks, not necessarily the tasks themselves. Lastly, we
discuss the practical implications on evaluating adversarial robustness, and
make initial attempts to understand this complex phenomenon.

mediators and the SM particles can be naturally suppressed if one employs a

in a finite width `fat' brane, similar to models of Universal Extra Dimensions
(UED), while DM, in turn, is confined to a thin brane at the opposite end of
the ED interval. Including brane localized kinetic terms on the fat brane for
the mediator fields, the resulting coupling between the SM and these light
mediators can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding
ones between the mediators and DM which we assume to be a typical gauge
coupling. We investigate the implications of this scenario for both vector
(i.e., dark photon, DP) and scalar mediator fields in the 5-D bulk. In this
setup kinetic mixing, which is usually employed to suppress light mediator
couplings, is not required. Here we assume that the SM particles couple to the
DP via their $B-L$ charges while the DP couples to the DM via a dark charge.
Both the vector DP couplings and the corresponding Higgs portal couplings with
the SM are shown to be natural small in magnitude with a size dependent on
ratio of the 5-D compactification radius, $R^{-1} \sim 0.1-1$ GeV, and the SM
brane thickness, $L^{-1} \sim 2-10$ TeV, a range chosen to avoid LHC and other
experimental constraints. In this framework one can obtain the observed value
of the DM relic abundance for a wide range of parameter choices, while the
constrains due to direct DM detection and the invisible width of the Higgs do
not impose significant challenges to the model. Finally, this mechanism can
lead to distinct signatures in both present and upcoming experiments as it
combines some common features of UED and DP models in a single ED setup.

the correctness of the new $\alpha$-equivalence axiomatisation. This gives rise
to a new notion of nominal unification, where solutions for unification
problems are pairs of a fixed-point context and a substitution. Although it may
seem less natural than the standard notion of nominal unifier based on

behaves better when equational theories are considered: for example, nominal
unification remains finitary in the presence of commutativity, whereas it
becomes infinitary when unifiers are expressed using freshness contexts. We
provide a definition of $\alpha$-equivalence modulo equational theories that
take into account A, C and AC theories. Based on this notion of equivalence, we
show that C-unification is finitary and we provide a sound and complete

simulations, motivated by porous dust aggregation model of planetesimal
formation. We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations using a monomer
interaction model with periodic boundary condition. We stretch out a dust
aggregate with a various initial volume filling factor between $10^{-2}$ and
0.5. We find that the tensile stress takes the maximum value at the time when
the volume filling factor decreases to about a half of the initial value. The
maximum stress is defined to be the tensile strength. We take an average of the
results with 10 different initial shapes to smooth out the effects of initial
shapes of aggregates. Finally, we numerically obtain the relation between the
tensile strength and the initial volume filling factor of dust aggregates. We
also use a simple semi-analytical model and successfully reproduce the
numerical results, which enables us to apply to a wide parameter range and
different materials. The obtained relation is consistent with previous
experiments and numerical simulations about silicate dust aggregates. We
estimate that the monomer radius of comet 67P has to be about 3.3--220

20-26 visibility gap, contemporaneous with its reactivation as a radio pulsar,
first observed on December 8. On December 13 the Nuclear Spectroscopic
Telescope Array (NUSTAR) detected X-ray emission up to at least 30 keV, with a
spectrum well-characterized by a blackbody plus power-law model with
temperature kT = 0.74+/-0.02 keV and photon index Gamma = 4.4+/-0.2 or by a
two-blackbody model with kT = 0.59+/-0.04 keV and kT = 1.0+/-0.1 keV, both
including an additional power-law component to account for emission above 10
keV, with Gamma_h = -0.2+/-1.5 and Gamma_h = 1.5+/-0.5, respectively. The
latter index is consistent with hard X-ray flux reported for the non-transient
magnetars. In the 2-10 keV bandpass, the absorbed flux is 2E-10 erg/s/cm^2, a
factor of 2 greater than the maximum flux extrapolated for the 2003 outburst.
The peak of the sinusoidal X-ray pulse lags the radio pulse by approx. 0.13
cycles, consistent with their phase relationship during the 2003 outburst. This
suggests a stable geometry in which radio emission originates on magnetic field
lines containing currents that heat a spot on the neutron star surface.
However, a measured energy-dependent phase shift of the pulsed X-rays suggests
that all X-ray emitting regions are not precisely co-aligned.

Since most ground-based optical observatories aimed at following-up GW sources
have a telescope with a small field-of-view (FOV) as compared to the GW sky
error region, we focus on a search strategy that involves dividing the GW patch
into tiles of the same area as the telescope FOV to strategically image the
entire patch. We present an improvement over the optimal telescope-scheduling
algorithm outlined in Rana et al. (2016), by combining the tiling and
galaxy-targeted search strategies, and factoring the effects of the source
airmass and telescope slew, along with setting constraints, into the scheduling
algorithm in order to increase the chances of identifying the GW counterpart.
We propose two separate algorithms: the airmass-weighted algorithm, a specific
solution to the Hungarian algorithm that maximizes probability acquired, while
minimizing the image airmass, and the slew-optimization algorithm that
minimizes the overall slew angle covered between images for the given
probability acquired by the optimal telescope-scheduling algorithm in Rana et
al. (2016). Using the observatory site of the GROWTH-India telescope as an
example, we generate 100s of skymaps to test the performance of our algorithms.
Our results indicate that slew-optimization can reduce the cumulative slew
angle in the observing schedule by 100s of degrees, saving several of minutes
of observing time without the loss of tiles and probability. Further, we
demonstrate that as compared to the greedy algorithm, the airmass-weighted
algorithm can acquire up to 20 % more probability and 30 sq. deg. more in areal

First, we obtain a necessary and sufficient norm condition for the reference

$P$ in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, and each point is given a supply of
$\mu(p)$ units of mass, where $\mu(p)$ could be a positive or a negative
integer, and the total sum of the supplies is $0$. The goal is to find a flow
(called a transportation map) that transports $\mu(p)$ units from any point $p$
with $\mu(p) > 0$, and transports $-\mu(p)$ units into any point $p$ with
$\mu(p) < 0$. Moreover, the flow should minimize the total distance traveled by
the transported mass. The optimal value is known as the transportation cost, or
the Earth Mover's Distance (from the points with positive supply to those with
negative supply). This problem has been widely studied in many fields of
computer science: from theoretical work in computational geometry, to
applications in computer vision, graphics, and machine learning.
  In this work we study approximation algorithms for the geometric
transportation problem. We give an algorithm which, for any fixed dimension
$d$, finds a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate transportation map in time
nearly-linear in $n$, and polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and in the logarithm
of the total supply. This is the first approximation scheme for the problem
whose running time depends on $n$ as $n\cdot \mathrm{polylog}(n)$. Our
techniques combine the generalized preconditioning framework of Sherman, which
is grounded in continuous optimization, with simple geometric arguments to
first reduce the problem to a minimum cost flow problem on a sparse graph, and
then to design a good preconditioner for this latter problem.

either (i) locate the first error bit, or (ii) undo a previous `wrong' flip. In
each SC attempt, the sequence of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) derived in the
previous SC attempt is exploited to decide which action to take. Accordingly, a
two-stage training method of the LSTM network is proposed, i.e., learn to
locate first error bits in the first stage, and then to undo `wrong' flips in
the second stage. Simulation results show that the proposed approach identifies
error bits more accurately and achieves better performance than the
state-of-the-art SC flip algorithms.

self-organised. We added mortality of individual honey bees to an existing
model of thermoregulation to account for elevated losses of bees that are
reported worldwide. The aim of analysis is to obtain a better fundamental
understanding of the consequences of individual mortality during winter. This
model resembles the well-known Keller-Segel model. In contrast to the often
studied Keller-Segel models, our model includes a chemotactic coefficient of
which the sign can change as honey bees have a preferred temperature: when the
local temperature is too low, they move towards higher temperatures, whereas
the opposite is true for too high temperatures. Our study shows that we can
distinguish two states of the colony: one in which the colony size is above a
certain critical number of bees in which the bees can keep the core temperature
of the colony above the threshold temperature, and one in which the core
temperature drops below the critical threshold and the mortality of the bees
increases dramatically, leading to a sudden death of the colony. This model
behaviour may explain the globally observed honey bee colony losses during
winter.

  A significant difficulty in this task arises when attempting to apply
established classification algorithms due to the requirement for fixed size
matrix or tensor representations of the graphs which may vary greatly in their
numbers of nodes and edges. Building on prior work combining explicit tensor
representations with a standard image-based classifier, we propose a model to
perform graph classification by extracting fixed size tensorial information

classification.

introduces PhysNet, a DNN architecture designed for predicting energies, forces

are generated in order to probe the performance of ML models for describing
chemical reactions, long-range interactions, and condensed phase systems. It is
shown that explicitly including electrostatics in energy predictions is crucial
for a qualitatively correct description of the asymptotic regions of a
potential energy surface (PES). PhysNet models trained on a systematically
constructed set of small peptide fragments (at most eight heavy atoms) are able
to generalize to considerably larger proteins like deca-alanine (Ala$_{10}$):
The optimized geometry of helical Ala$_{10}$ predicted by PhysNet is virtually
identical to ab initio results (RMSD = 0.21 \r{A}). By running unbiased
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ala$_{10}$ on the PhysNet-PES in gas

wreath-shaped configuration, which is more stable than the helical form by 0.46
kcal mol$^{-1}$ according to the reference ab initio calculations.

different spatial extents of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan

behind these designs is to take advantage of very-high surface-to-volume ratios
to reduce SEE and ion erosion by internal trapping and redeposition. This has
resulted in renewed interest to study electron-electron processes in relevant
thruster wall materials. In this work, we present calculations of SEE yields in
micro-porous hexagonal BN surfaces using stochastic simulations of
electron-material interactions in discretized surface geometries. Our model
consists of two complementary parts. First we study SEE as a function of
primary electron energy and incidence angle in flat surfaces using Monte Carlo
simulations of electron multi-scattering processes. The results are then used
to represent the response function of discrete surface elements to individual
electron rays generated using a ray-tracing Monte Carlo model. We find that
micro-porous surfaces result in SEE yield reductions of over 50% in the energy
range experienced in Hall thrusters. This points to the suitability of these
micro-architected surface concepts to mitigate SEE-related issues in compact

Markov jump processes on a finite state-space. In this paper, we analyse the
dynamical large deviations of such models, starting from their microscopic
version, the chemical master equation. By taking a large-volume limit, we show
that those systems can be described by a path integral formalism over a
Lagrangian functional of concentrations and chemical fluxes. This Lagrangian is
dual to a Hamiltonian, whose trajectories correspond to the most likely
evolution of the system given its boundary conditions. The same can be done for
a system biased on time-averaged concentrations and currents, yielding a biased
Hamiltonian whose trajectories are optimal paths conditioned on those
observables. The appropriate boundary conditions turn out to be mixed, so that,
in the long time limit, those trajectories converge to well-defined attractors.
We are then able to identify the largest value that the Hamiltonian takes over
those attractors with the scaled cumulant generating function of our
observables, providing a non-linear equivalent to the well-known
Donsker-Varadhan formula for jump processes. On that basis, we prove that
chemical reaction networks that are deterministically multistable generically
undergo first-order dynamical phase transitions in the vicinity of zero bias.
We illustrate that fact through a simple bistable model called the Schl\""ogl
model, as well as multistable and unstable generalisations of it, and we make a
few surprising observations regarding the stability of deterministic fixed
points, and the breaking of ergodicity in the large-volume limit.

collisions. The cross section for the $g g \to \chi_{c J_1} \chi_{c J_2}$ is
considerably smaller (especially for $\chi_{c 1} \chi_{c 1}$ final state) than
that obtained recently in the $k_T$-factorization approach. We calculate
therefore next-to-leading order contributions with $\chi_c$ pair and one extra
associated (mini-)jet. We find these contributions to be much larger than those
for the $2 \to 2$ contribution. Especially the emission of a leading gluon
(carrying a large momentum fraction of one of the incoming gluons) are
important. These emissions in the $k_T$-factorization approach are absorbed
into the initial state unintegrated gluon distributions. A smaller contribution
to the cross section comes from the production of central gluons emitted with
rapidities between the $\chi_c$-mesons. They do lead, however, to an
enhancement of the $\chi_c$-pair production at large rapidity distance between
the mesons. Our present study explains the size of the cross section for the
$\chi_c$ pair production obtained previously in the $k_T$-factorization
approach. Several differential distributions are presented.

preferences with the Mallows rank model, and its finite mixture extension, in a
Bayesian probabilistic framework.
  The Mallows model is a well-known model, grounded on the idea that the
probability density of an observed ranking decreases exponentially fast as its
distance to the location parameter increases. Despite the model being quite
popular, this is the first Bayesian implementation that allows a wide choice of
distances, and that works well with a large amount of items to be ranked.
BayesMallows supports footrule, Spearman, Kendall, Cayley, Hamming and Ulam
distances, allowing full use of the rich expressiveness of the Mallows model.
This is possible thanks to the implementation of fast algorithms for
approximating the partition function of the model under various distances.
Although developed for being used in computing the posterior distribution of
the model, these algorithms may be of interest in their own right.
  BayesMallows handles non-standard data: partial rankings and pairwise
comparisons, even in cases including non-transitive preference patterns. The
advantage of the Bayesian paradigm in this context comes from its ability to
coherently quantify posterior uncertainties of estimates of any quantity of
interest. These posteriors are fully available to the user, and the package
comes with convienient tools for summarizing and visualizing the posterior
distributions.

includes the study of the preceding confined C2.4 flare that occurred on the

consequence of two distinct triggering events well separated in time. The first
triggering episode occurred as early as ~20 minutes before the onset of the
M9.0 flare, evidenced by the destabilization and rise of a pre-existing
filament to a new position of equilibrium at a higher coronal altitude during
the decay phase of the C2.4 flare. This brought the system to a magnetic
configuration where the establishment of the second triggering event was
favorable. The second triggering episode occurred ~17 minutes later, during the
early phase of the M9.0 flare, evidenced by the further rise of the filament
and successful ejection. The second trigger is followed by a flare precursor
phase, characterized by non-thermal emission and the sequential formation of a
hot channel as shown by the SDO/AIA DEM (differential emission measure) maps,
the RHESSI X-ray images and spectra. These observations are suggestive of
magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration that can explain the precursor
phase and can be directly related to the formation of the hot channel. We
discuss on the triggering mechanisms, their implications during the early and

build upon previous experiences to speed up and enhance learning of new tasks.
Two distinct research paradigms have studied this question. Meta-learning views
this problem as learning a prior over model parameters that is amenable for
fast adaptation on a new task, but typically assumes the set of tasks are
available together as a batch. In contrast, online (regret based) learning
considers a sequential setting in which problems are revealed one after the
other, but conventionally train only a single model without any task-specific
adaptation. This work introduces an online meta-learning setting, which merges
ideas from both the aforementioned paradigms to better capture the spirit and
practice of continual lifelong learning. We propose the follow the meta leader
algorithm which extends the MAML algorithm to this setting. Theoretically, this
work provides an $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret guarantee with only one
additional higher order smoothness assumption in comparison to the standard
online setting. Our experimental evaluation on three different large-scale
tasks suggest that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms
alternatives based on traditional online learning approaches.

matter model, backreaction arises in terms of the deviation of the averaged
spatial scalar curvature from a constant-curvature model on some averaging
domain $D$, $W_D$, and the kinematical backreaction $Q_D$. These backreaction
variables can be modeled as an effective scalar field, called the `morphon
field'. The general cosmological equations still need a closure condition to be
solved. A simple example is the class of scaling solutions where $W_D$ and
$Q_D$ are assumed to follow a power law of the volume scale factor $a_D$. But
while they can describe models of quintessence, these and other models still
assume the existence of dark matter in addition to the known sources. Going
beyond scaling solutions by using a model for structure formation that we argue
is reasonably generic, we investigate the correspondence between the morphon
field and fundamental scalar field dark matter models, in order to describe
dark matter as an effective phenomenon arising from kinematical backreaction
and the averaged spatial curvature of the inhomogeneous Universe. While we find
significant differences with those fundamental models, our main result is that
the energy budget on typical collapsing domains is provided by curvature and
matter in equal parts already around the turn-around time, leading to curvature
dominance thereafter and increasing to a curvature contribution of $3/4$ of the
energy budget at the onset of virialization. Kinematical backreaction is
subdominant at early stages, but its importance rises quickly after turn-around
and dominates the curvature contribution in the final phase of the collapse. We
conclude that backreaction can indeed mimic dark matter (in the energy budget)
during the collapse phase of megaparsec-scale structures.

axis, are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves. The most
sensitive searches for these sources are based on accurate matched filtering
techniques, that assume the continuous wave to be phase-locked with the pulsar
beamed emission. While matched filtering maximizes the search sensitivity, a
significant signal-to-noise ratio loss will happen in case of a mismatch
between the assumed and the true signal phase evolution. Narrow-band algorithms
allow for a small mismatch in the frequency and spin-down values of the pulsar
while integrating coherently the entire data set. In this paper we describe a
narrow-band search using LIGO O2 data for the continuous wave emission of 33
pulsars. No evidence for a continuous wave signal has been found and
upper-limits on the gravitational wave amplitude, over the analyzed frequency
and spin-down volume, have been computed for each of the targets. In this
search we have surpassed the spin-down limit for some of the pulsars already
present in the O1 LIGO narrow-band search, such as J1400\textminus6325
J1813\textminus1246, J1833\textminus1034, J1952+3252, and for new targets such
as J0940\textminus5428 and J1747\textminus2809. For J1400\textminus6325,
J1833\textminus1034 and J1747\textminus2809 this is the first time the
spin-down limit is surpassed.

1000-fold by 2020, compared to 2010. This is mainly because of the rapid
increase in the number of wireless devices and data hungry applications
per-device. This creates a formidable bandwidth crisis. Milimeter-wave (mmWave)
systems with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) operation are two
complementary concepts poised to meet this exploding demand, as verified by the
wealth of investigations by both industry and academia. Nevertheless, existing
MIMO processing techniques, requiring a dedicated radio-frequency (RF)
up/down-conversion chain per antenna, results in prohibitively high complexity
and cost of the mmWave prototypes. The primary objective of this paper is to
present a complete feasibility study on alternative beamforming techniques
targeted to reduce the system complexity without drastically compromising its
performance. More precisely, at 28 GHz, we investigate the end-to-end
performance of two different lens-based beamforming topologies. Our study is an
amalgam of theoretical modelling, electromagnetic design, and prototype
manufacturing, yielding a comprehensive mmWave, massive MIMO performance
evaluation.

ferromagnetic phases (FM1 and FM2) coexisting with spin-triplet

model, is extended to the situation with applied Zeeman field. The model
provides and rationalizes in a semiquantitative manner the principal features
of the phase diagram observed for $\mathrm{UGe_2}$ in the field absence [cf.
Phys. Rev. B $\mathbf{97}$, 224519 (2018)]. As spin-dependent effects play a
crucial role for both the ferromagnetic and SC states, the role of the Zeeman
field is to single out different stable spin-triplet SC phases. This analysis
should thus be helpful in testing the proposed real-space pairing mechanism,
which may be regarded as complementary to spin-fluctuation theory suitable for
$\mathrm{^3He}$. Specifically, we demonstrate that the presence of the two
distinct phases, FM1 and FM2, and associated field-driven metamagnetic
transition between them, induce respective metasuperconducting phase
transformation. At the end, we discuss briefly how the spin fluctuations might
be incorporated as a next step into the considered here renormalized
quasiparticle picture.

alternative method was proposed long time ago, which does not require the

transversity distributions from the SIDIS data alone. The method utilizes the
ratio of the difference of the Collins asymmetries of positively and negatively

We have applied this method to the COMPASS proton and deuteron data, and
extracted the ratio $h_1^d/h_1^u$. The results are compared to those obtained

requires the adoption of detector architectures which are intrinsically
difficult to attack. In this paper, we do so, by exploiting a recently proposed
multiple-classifier architecture combining the improved security of 1-Class
(1C) classification and the good performance ensured by conventional 2-Class
(2C) classification in the absence of attacks. The architecture, also known as
1.5-Class (1.5C) classifier, consists of one 2C classifier and two 1C
classifiers run in parallel followed by a final 1C classifier. In our system,
the first three classifiers are implemented by means of Support Vector Machines
(SVM) fed with SPAM features. The outputs of such classifiers are then
processed by a final 1C SVM in charge of making the final decision. Particular
care is taken to design a proper strategy to train the SVMs the 1.5C classifier
relies on. This is a crucial task, due to the difficulty of training the two 1C

from distributions in challenging high-dimensional and non-convex statistics
and machine learning applications. Despite this, current bounds for the
Langevin algorithms are slower than those of competing algorithms in many
important situations, for instance when sampling from weakly log-concave
distributions, or when sampling or optimizing non-convex log-densities. In this
paper, we obtain improved bounds in many of these situations, showing that the
Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) is faster than the best bounds
for its competitor algorithms when the target distribution satisfies weak
third- and fourth- order regularity properties associated with the input data.
In many settings, our regularity conditions are weaker than the usual Euclidean
operator norm regularity properties, allowing us to show faster bounds for a
much larger class of distributions than would be possible with the usual
Euclidean operator norm approach, including in statistics and machine learning
applications where the data satisfy a certain incoherence condition. In
particular, we show that using our regularity conditions one can obtain faster
bounds for applications which include sampling problems in Bayesian logistic
regression with weakly convex priors, and the nonconvex optimization problem of
learning linear classifiers with zero-one loss functions.
  Our main technical contribution in this paper is our analysis of the
Metropolis acceptance probability of MALA in terms of its ""energy-conservation
error,"" and our bound for this error in terms of third- and fourth- order
regularity conditions. Our combination of this higher-order analysis of the
energy conservation error with the conductance method is key to obtaining
bounds which have a sub-linear dependence on the dimension $d$ in the
non-strongly logconcave setting.

millions of new domains are created on a daily basis. While the vast majority

carry out nefarious purposes, such as scams, phishing, or other types of
attacks. In this paper, we present insights on the global utilization of DNS
through a measurement study examining exclusively newly observed hostnames via
passive DNS data analysis. We analyzed more than two billion such hostnames
collected over a period of two months. Surprisingly, we find that only three
second-level domains are responsible for more than half of all newly observed
hostnames every day. More specifically, we found that Google's Accelerated
Mobile Pages (AMP) project, the music streaming service Spotify, and a DNS
tunnel provider generate the majority of new domains on the Internet. DNS
tunneling is a covert channel technique to transfer arbitrary information over
DNS via DNS queries and answers. This technique is often (ab)used by attackers
to transfer data in a stealthy way, bypassing traditional network security
systems. We find that potential DNS tunnels cause a significant fraction of the
global DNS requests for new hostnames: our analysis reveals that nearly all
resource record type NULL requests and more than a third of all TXT requests
can be attributed to DNS tunnels.
  Motivated by these empirical measurement results, we propose and implement a
method to identify DNS tunnels via a step-wise filtering approach that relies
on general characteristics of such tunnels (e.g., number of subdomains or
resource record type). Using our approach on empirical data, we successfully
identified 273 suspicious domains related to DNS tunnels, including two known

implies a postshock electron temperature of 0.84\pm0.20 keV which is consistent
with the estimate of 0.68\pm0.05 keV based on the X-ray spectral analysis. We

generate a grid of one-dimensional models for a range of ejecta masses (2-6
\msol) to constrain the explosion energy, age, circumstellar density, swept-up
mass, and unshocked-ejecta mass. We find acceptable solutions for a constant
density ambient medium and for an r^{-2} power-law profile (appropriate for a
constant progenitor stellar wind). For the constant density case, we find an
age of \sim 1700 yr, explosion energies 0.87-2.61\times10^{51} erg, ambient
densities 0.85-2.54 amu cm^{-3}, swept-up masses 22-66 \msol, and

was 0.5-1.5\times10^{51} erg, ejecta masses 2-3.5 \msol are favored for the

for understanding the mathematics of blocking events. Analysing error growth
rates along a very long model trajectory, we show that blockings are associated
with conditions of anomalously high instability of the atmosphere.
Additionally, the lifetime of a blocking is positively correlated with the
intensity of such an anomaly, against intuition. In the case of Atlantic
blockings, predictability is especially reduced at the onset and decay of the
blocking, while a relative increase of predictability is found in the mature
phase, while the opposite holds for Pacific blockings, for which predictability
is lowest in the mature phase. We associate blockings to a specific class of
unstable periodic orbits (UPOs), natural modes of variability that cover the
attractor of the system. The UPOs differ substantially in terms of instability,
which explains the diversity of the atmosphere in terms predictability. The
UPOs associated to blockings are indeed anomalously unstable, which leads to
them being rarely visited. The onset of a blocking takes place when the
trajectory of the system hops into the neighbourhood of one of these special
UPOs. The decay takes place when the trajectory hops back to the neighbourhood
of usual, less unstable UPOs associated with zonal flow. This justifies the
classical Markov chains-based analysis of transitions between weather regimes.
The existence of UPOs differing in the dimensionality of their unstable
manifold indicates a very strong violation of hyperbolicity in the model, which
leads to a lack of structural stability. We propose that this is could be a
generic feature of atmospheric models and might be a fundamental cause behind
difficulties in representing blockings for the current climate and
uncertainties in predicting how their statistics will change as a result of
climate change.

the circumnuclear torus surrounding the supermassive black hole. From the

the size of the molecular gas region in the torus is at least 1~pc. The broad

power in the last decades has had on turbulence research. It is argued that it
can be divided into three stages. In the earliest (`heroic') one, simulations
were expensive and could at most be considered as substitutes for experiments.
Later, as computers grew faster and some meaningful simulations could be
performed overnight, it became practical to use them as (`routine') as tools to
provide answers to specific theoretical questions. More recently, some
turbulence simulations have become trivial, able to run in minutes, and it is
possible to think of computers as `Monte Carlo' theory machines, which can be
used to systematically pose a wide range of `random' theoretical questions,
only to later evaluate which of them are interesting or useful. Although
apparently wasteful, it is argued that this procedure has the advantage of
being reasonably independence of received wisdom, and thus more able than human
researchers to scape established paradigms. The rate of growth of computer
power ensures that the interval between consecutive stages is about fifteen
years. Rather than offering conclusions, the purpose of the paper is to
stimulate discussion on whether machine- and human-generated theories can be
considered comparable concepts, and on how the challenges and opportunities
created by our new computer `colleagues' can be made to fit into the
traditional research process.

with non-i.i.d. structure. However, when the dimension $p$ is large relative to
sample size $n$ and where either or both of means and covariances/graphical
models may differ between the latent groups, mixture models face statistical
and computational difficulties and currently available methods cannot
realistically go beyond $p \! \sim \! 10^4$ or so. We propose an approach
called Model-based Clustering via Adaptive Projections (MCAP). Instead of
estimating mixtures in the original space, we work with a low-dimensional
representation obtained by linear projection. The projection dimension itself
plays an important role and governs a type of bias-variance tradeoff with
respect to recovery of the relevant signals. MCAP sets the projection dimension
automatically in a data-adaptive manner, using a proxy for the assignment risk.
Combining a full covariance formulation with the adaptive projection allows
detection of both mean and covariance signals in very high dimensional
problems. We show real-data examples in which covariance signals are reliably
detected in problems with $p \! \sim \! 10^4$ or more, and simulations going up
to $p = 10^6$. In some examples, MCAP performs well even when the mean signal
is entirely removed, leaving differential covariance structure in the
high-dimensional space as the only signal. Across a number of regimes, MCAP
performs as well or better than a range of existing methods, including a
recently-proposed $\ell_1$-penalized approach; and performance remains broadly
stable with increasing dimension. MCAP can be run ""out of the box"" and is fast
enough for interactive use on large-$p$ problems using standard desktop
computing resources.

average harvested power at the user is derived while considering the nonlinear
RF EH model and a tight analytical approximation for it is also presented by
exploring the practical limits on the API. Using these developments, the
jointly global optimal transmit power and time allocation for channel
estimation (CE) and EBF phases, that maximizes the average energy stored at the

the astronomical community with sky regions covering mostly over hundreds of
square degrees. Among them, 6 have been finally confirmed as real astrophysical
events. Since 2013, a new set of ground-based robotic telescopes called GWAC
and its pathfinder mini-GWAC have been developed to contribute to the various
challenges of themulti-messenger and time domain astronomy. The GWAC system is
built up in the framework of the ground-segment system of the SVOM mission that
will be devoted to the study of the multi-wavelength transient sky in the next
decade. During O2, only the mini-GWAC telescopenetwork was fully operational.
Due to the wide field of view and fast automatic follow-up capabilities of the
mini-GWAC telescopes, they were well adapted to efficiently cover the sky
localization areas of the gravitational wave event candidates. In this paper,
we present the mini-GWAC pipeline we have set up to respond to the GW alerts
and we report our optical follow-up observations of 8 GW alerts detected during
the O2 run. Our observations provided the largest coverage of the GW
localization areas in a short latency made by any optical facility. We found
tens of optical transient candidates in our images, but none of those could be
securely associated with any confirmed black hole-black hole merger event.
Based on this first experience and the near future technical improvements of
our network system, we will be more competitive to detect the optical
counterparts from some gravitational wave events that will be detected during
the upcoming O3 run, especially those emerging from binary neutron star
mergers.

secondary buckling, we conclude that a classical bulge along with the gas
central concentration may be the main culprits for the rarity of bars with
ongoing buckling in the local Universe.

environmental epidemiology. An accurate estimation of air-pollution effects
requires spatio-temporally resolved datasets of air-pollution, especially, Fine
Particulate Matter (PM). Satellite-based technology has greatly enhanced the
ability to provide PM assessments in locations where direct measurement is
impossible.
  Indirect PM measurement is a statistical prediction problem. The
spatio-temporal statistical literature offer various predictive models:
Gaussian Random Fields (GRF) and Linear Mixed Models (LMM), in particular. GRF
emphasize the spatio-temporal structure in the data, but are computationally
demanding to fit. LMMs are computationally easier to fit, but require some
tampering to deal with space and time.
  Recent advances in the spatio-temporal statistical literature propose to
alleviate the computation burden of GRFs by approximating them with Gaussian
Markov Random Fields (GMRFs). Since LMMs and GMRFs are both computationally
feasible, the question arises: which is statistically better? We show that
despite the great popularity of LMMs in environmental monitoring and pollution
assessment, LMMs are statistically inferior to GMRF for measuring PM in the
Northeastern USA.

this method, a modified leap-frog scheme is applied for time discretization and
a Galerkin finite element method is applied for spatial discretization. We
prove that the proposed method keeps the energy conservation in the given
discrete norm. Comparing with non-conservative schemes, our algorithm keeps
higher stability. Meanwhile, an optimal error estimate for the proposed scheme
is given by an error splitting technique. That is, we split the error into two
parts, one from temporal discretization and the other from spatial
discretization. First, by introducing a time-discrete system, we prove the
uniform boundedness for the solution of this time-discrete system in some
strong norms and obtain error estimates in temporal direction. With the help of
the preliminary temporal estimates, we then prove the pointwise uniform
boundedness of the finite element solution, and obtain the optimal $L^2$-norm
error estimates in the sense that the time step size is not related to spatial
mesh size. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the
convergence-order, unconditional stability and energy conservation.

such correlated quantum system in recent years for a wide range of
applications. In this work, we continue the development of the MPS approach to
study ultrafast electron dynamics in quantum chemical systems. The method
combines time evolution schemes, such as fourth-order Runge-Kutta and Krylov
space time evolution, with MPS, in order to solve the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation efficiently. This allows for describing electron
dynamics in molecules on a full configurational interaction (CI) level for a
few femtoseconds after excitation. As a benchmark, we compare MPS based
calculations to full CI calculations for a chain of hydrogen atoms and for the
water molecule. Krylov space time evolution is in particular suited for the MPS
approach, as it provides a wide range of opportunities to be adjusted to the
reduced MPS dimension case. Finally, we apply the MPS approach to describe

by the emission of progeny droplets as a crucial pathway of the Rayleigh
fission process. In spite of considerable theoretical progress, a quantitative
understanding of this breakup pathway through mathematical models has largely
remained inconclusive. This limitation has mainly been due to the fact that the
generally applied electrostatic boundary condition of the equipotential surface
may not be valid near conical ends that experience a singularly fast dynamics
near the point of fission. Considering this, we address the problem by invoking
the surface charge dynamics within the framework of an axisymmetric boundary
element method (BEM), in the viscous limit. The abandonment of the
equipotential assumption gives rise to weak tangential electric stresses which
turn out to be key the contributors to the emergence of a jet followed by
formation of a progeny droplet. The simulations further predict that the size
of the progeny droplet follows an inverse power-law scaling relationship with
the conductivity of the liquid drop and the smaller sized progenies carry a
charge close to its Rayleigh limit.

frequencies $\gtrsim 10$ Hz. We use advanced LIGO data from its first and
second observing runs spanning 2015-2017, which provides the
highest-sensitivity gravitational-wave data so far obtained. In this search we
target emission from both the $l = m = 2$ mass quadrupole mode, with a
frequency at twice that of the pulsar's rotation, and from the $l = 2$, $m = 1$
mode, with a frequency at the pulsar rotation frequency. The search finds no
evidence for gravitational-wave emission from any pulsar at either frequency.
For the $l = m = 2$ mode search, we provide updated upper limits on the
gravitational-wave amplitude, mass quadrupole moment, and fiducial ellipticity
for 167 pulsars, and the first such limits for a further 55. For 20 young
pulsars these results give limits that are below those inferred from the
pulsars' spin-down. For the Crab and Vela pulsars our results constrain
gravitational-wave emission to account for less than 0.017% and 0.18% of the
spin-down luminosity, respectively. For the recycled millisecond pulsar
J0711-6830 our limits are only a factor of 1.3 above the spin-down limit,
assuming the canonical value of $10^{38}$ kg m$^2$ for the star's moment of
inertia, and imply a gravitational-wave-derived upper limit on the star's
ellipticity of $1.2\!\times\!10^{-8}$. We also place new limits on the emission
amplitude at the rotation frequency of the pulsars.

events in searches for new phenomena is described. The alternative is based on
probability density functions used in the evaluation of the `significance' of
an observation, rather than the typical ratio of signal to background. The
method is also applicable to searches that use unbinned data, for which the
concept of signal to background can be ambiguous. In the case of simple
searches using binned data, this method reproduces the familiar quantity
$\log(s/b)$ , when the signal to background ratio is small.

the optical emission of dot-in-a-nanowire heterostructures in III-V material
systems. Under direct optical excitation, the excitonic energy levels in
III-nitride dot-in-a-nanowire heterostructures oscillate at the acoustic
frequency, producing a characteristic splitting of the emission lines in the
time-integrated photoluminescence spectra. This acoustically induced periodic
tuning of the excitonic transition energies is combined with spectral detection
filtering and employed as a tool to regulate the temporal output of
anti-bunched photons emitted from these nanowire quantum dots. In addition, the
acoustic transport of electrons and holes along a III-arsenide nanowire injects
the electric charges into an ensemble of quantum dot-like recombination centers
that are spatially separated from the optical excitation area. The acoustic
population and depopulation mechanism determines the number of carrier
recombination events taking place simultaneously in the ensemble, thus allowing
a control of the anti-bunching degree of the emitted photons. The present
results are relevant for the dynamic control of single photon emission in III-V
semiconductor heterostructures.

neighbourhood of a smooth curve in a surface. This paper is devoted to describe
some properties of coherent sheaves on such a curve and their Simpson moduli
space. In particular we give necessary and sufficent conditions for the
existence of semistable quasi locally free sheaves (in the sense of Dr\'ezet)
of a fixed complete type and we compute the dimension of the Zariski closure in
the moduli space of the locus of semistable quasi locally free sheaves of a
fixed complete type. We also show when vector bundles on the reduced subcurve
deform to sheaves supported on the ribbon. We find a special kind of non quasi
locally free sheaves which, as generalized line bundles, are direct images of
quasi locally free sheaves on an appropriate blow up of the ribbon. Finally, we
give a conjectural description of the irreducible components of the Simpson
moduli space, explaining precisely which parts have already been proved and
what lacks for the complete result.

  accessibility","7 pages, 0 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Standard neuroimaging techniques provide non-invasive access not only to
human brain anatomy but also to its physiology. The activity recorded with
these techniques is generally called functional imaging, but what is observed
per se is an instance of dynamics, from which functional brain activity should
be extracted. Distinguishing between bare dynamics and genuine function is a
highly non-trivial task, but a crucially important one when comparing
experimental observations and interpreting their significance. Here we
illustrate how the ability of neuroimaging to extract genuine functional brain
activity is bounded by the structure of functional representations. To do so,
we first provide a simple definition of functional brain activity from a
system-level brain imaging perspective. We then review how the properties of
the space on which brain activity is represented allow defining relations
ranging from distinguishability to accessibility of observed imaging data. We
show how these properties result from the structure defined on dynamical data
and dynamics-to-function projections, and consider some implications that the
way and extent to which these are defined have for the interpretation of
experimental data from standard system-level brain recording techniques.

metastable states, which arise from cooling or heating across the equilibrium
phase boundaries. A return to the equilibrium configuration can be achieved by
inducing vortex motion. Here we report on small-angle neutron scattering
studies of MgB2, focusing on the structural properties of the vortex lattice as
it is gradually driven from metastable to equilibrium states by an AC magnetic
field. Measurements were performed using initial metastable states obtained
either by cooling or heating across the equilibrium phase transition. In all
cases, the longitudinal correlation length remains constant and comparable to
the sample thickness. Correspondingly, the vortex lattice may be considered as
a system of straight rods, where the formation and growth of equilibrium state
domains only occurs in the two-dimensional plane perpendicular to the applied
field direction. Spatially resolved raster scans of the sample were performed
with apertures as small as 80 microns, corresponding to only 1.2*10^6 vortices
for an applied field of 0.5 T. These revealed spatial variations in the
metastable and equilibrium vortex lattice populations, but individual domains
were not directly resolved. A statistical analysis of the data indicates an
upper limit on the average domain size of approximately 50 microns.

composition, which diffuse at very different rates. This leads to various
instabilities, bearing the name of double-diffusive convection. We investigate
rotating double-diffusive convection (RDDC) in fluid spheres. We use the
Boussinesq approximation with homogeneous internal thermal and compositional
source terms. We focus on the finger regime, in which the thermal gradient is
stabilising whereas the compositional one is destabilising. First, we perform a
global linear stability analysis in spheres. The critical Rayleigh numbers
drastically drop for stably stratified fluids, yielding large-scale convective
motions where local analyses predict stability. We evidence the inviscid nature
of this large-scale double-diffusive instability, enabling the determination of
the marginal stability curve at realistic planetary regimes. In particular, we
show that in stably stratified spheres, the Rayleigh numbers $Ra$ at the onset
evolve like $Ra \sim Ek^{-1}$, where $Ek$ is the Ekman number. This differs
from rotating convection in unstably stratified spheres, for which $Ra \sim
Ek^{-4/3}$. The domain of existence of inviscid convection thus increases as
$Ek^{-1/3}$. Second, we perform nonlinear simulations. We find a transition
between two regimes of RDDC, controlled by the strength of the stratification.
Furthermore, far from the RDDC onset, we find a dominating equatorially
anti-symmetric, large-scale zonal flow slightly above the associated linear
onset. Unexpectedly, a purely linear mechanism can explain this phenomenon,
even far from the instability onset, yielding a symmetry breaking of the
nonlinear flow at saturation. For even stronger stable stratification, the flow
becomes mainly equatorially-symmetric and intense zonal jets develop. Finally,
we apply our results to the early Earth core. Double diffusion can reduce the
critical Rayleigh number by four decades for realistic core conditions. We
suggest that the early Earth core was prone to turbulent RDDC, with large-scale
zonal flows.

emulsion structure and stability. This could have significant consequences for
using particle stabilisation in industrial applications where increased
stability is generally desirable. It is therefore important to characterise the
behaviour and stability of these composites under the influence of freeze-thaw
cycles. Water-in-oil Pickering emulsions stabilised by poly(methyl
methacrylate) particles were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles of the continuous
phase under two different conditions - uniform and non-uniform freezing.
Confocal microscopy was used to study the emulsion behaviour and structure
during these processes. The effect of droplet size and cooling rate on
uniformly frozen emulsions was also considered. The final structure of the
emulsion after a single freeze-thaw cycle is strongly dependent on the freezing
method. Uniformly frozen emulsions show crumpled droplet structures, while
non-uniformly frozen emulsions have a non-uniform structure containing
foam-like regions not observed in uniform freezing. Droplet size has little
effect on the final structure of uniformly frozen emulsions, which we attribute
to the Laplace pressure in the droplets being orders of magnitude smaller than
the pressure exerted on the droplets by the growing oil crystals. Cooling rate
also has little effect as droplets become surrounded and trapped by oil
crystals rapidly after samples reach the oil freezing temperature, irrespective
of the speed at which they reached that temperature. When compared to
surfactant-stabilised emulsions undergoing the same process, we find emulsion

gravity recently proposed by Chamseddine and Mukhanov. This is a novel theory
of ghost-free massive gravity which additionally contains a mimetic dark matter
component. In an echo of other modified gravity theories, there are
self-accelerating solutions which contain a ghost instability. In the
ghost-free region of parameter space, the effect of the graviton mass on the
cosmic expansion history amounts to an effective negative cosmological
constant, a radiation component, and a negative curvature term. This allows us
to place constraints on the model parameters---the graviton mass and the
St\""uckelberg vacuum expectation value---by insisting that the effective
radiation and curvature terms be within observational bounds. The late-time
acceleration must be accounted for by a separate positive cosmological constant
or other dark energy sector. We impose further constraints at the level of
perturbations by demanding linear stability. We comment on the possibility of
distinguishing this theory from $\Lambda$CDM with current and future
large-scale structure surveys.

Siamese and Triplet-Loss, based on the AlexNet, VGG-19, DenseNet201,

techniques are widely used to estimate such difficult-to-measure process

datasets including the information of various states such as operation modes,
but the fault dataset with the target variable is insufficient as the training

the training dataset. To incorporate the incomplete dataset, we consider the
properties of processes at transition points between operation modes in the
system. The regression coefficients of the operation modes are estimated under
constraint conditions obtained from the information on the mode transitions. In
a case study, this constrained soft sensor modeling was used to predict
refrigerant leaks in air-conditioning systems with heating and cooling
operation modes. The results show that this modeling method is promising for
soft sensors in a system with multiple operation modes.

achieved by solving a non-convex optimization problem using a grid-based search

multiple steerable beams with a larger number of users in the network and
propose an algorithm to cluster users and serve each cluster with a separate

Finally, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme for the beam

the users. The simulation results show that the proposed beam steering method
can efficiently serve a high number of users, and with power optimization, a

Translation (NAT) has attracted attention recently due to its high efficiency
in inference. However, the high efficiency has come at the cost of not
capturing the sequential dependency on the target side of translation, which
causes NAT to suffer from two kinds of translation errors: 1) repeated
translations (due to indistinguishable adjacent decoder hidden states), and 2)
incomplete translations (due to incomplete transfer of source side information
via the decoder hidden states).
  In this paper, we propose to address these two problems by improving the
quality of decoder hidden representations via two auxiliary regularization
terms in the training process of an NAT model. First, to make the hidden states
more distinguishable, we regularize the similarity between consecutive hidden
states based on the corresponding target tokens. Second, to force the hidden
states to contain all the information in the source sentence, we leverage the
dual nature of translation tasks (e.g., English to German and German to
English) and minimize a backward reconstruction error to ensure that the hidden
states of the NAT decoder are able to recover the source side sentence.
Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets show that both
regularization strategies are effective and can alleviate the issues of
repeated translations and incomplete translations in NAT models. The accuracy
of NAT models is therefore improved significantly over the state-of-the-art NAT
models with even better efficiency for inference.

and tested on supernovae (SNe) Ia observations. The model predicts a cyclic
expansion/contraction evolution of the Universe within a limited range of scale
factors. The maximum scale factor is controlled by the overcritical density of
the Universe, the minimum scale factor depends on global stellar and dust
masses in the Universe. During contraction due to gravitational forces, the
extragalactic background light (EBL) and intergalactic opacity increase with
time because of a smaller proper volume of the Universe. The radiation pressure
produced by absorption of the EBL by dust steeply rises and counterbalances the
gravitational forces. The maximum redshift, at which the radiation pressure is
capable to stop the contraction and start a new expansion, is between 15 and
45. The model avoids the Big Bang and concepts of the non-baryonic dark matter
and dark energy. The model successfully explains the existence of very old
mature galaxies at high redshifts and observed dimming of the luminosity of SNe
Ia with redshift. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is interpreted as
thermal radiation of intergalactic dust and its temperature is predicted with
accuracy higher than 2%. The CMB temperature anisotropies are caused by the EBL
fluctuations related to large-scale structures in the Universe. A strong
decline of the luminosity density at z > 4 is explained by high opacity of the
Universe rather than by its darkness due to a missing stellar mass at high
redshifts.
