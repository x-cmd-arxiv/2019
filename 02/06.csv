produce nonlocal effects in quantum mechanics. It is generally believed that
such a nonlocal behavior of the magnetic field is not possible in classical
physics and that this represents a clear difference between classical and
quantum mechanics. Contrary to these beliefs, we argue that the classical
counterpart of the Aharonov-Bohm phase, which is identified here with the
electromagnetic angular momentum of the configuration formed by an electric
charge moving around an infinitely-long solenoid enclosing a uniform magnetic
flux, shows that the magnetic field may produce nonlocal effects in classical
mechanics. We discuss this momentum in detail by putting special emphasis on
its topological and nonlocal features. The momentum is topological because it
depends on the number of windings the electric charge carries out around the
solenoid and is nonlocal because the magnetic flux has no local consequences at
any point on the charge trajectory. The topological feature allows us to
introduce the concept of accumulated electromagnetic angular momentum and the
nonlocal feature allows us to speak of a dynamical nonlocality attributable to
the equations of classical electrodynamics.

suggests that thermally-driven disruption may be an important process in the
removal of rocky bodies in the Solar System. Here we report our study of how
the debris streams arise from possible thermally-driven disruptions in the
near-Sun region. We calculate that a small body with a diameter $\gtrsim0.5$ km
can produce a sufficient amount of material to allow the detection of the
debris at the Earth as meteor showers, and that bodies at such sizes thermally
disrupt every $\sim2$ kyrs. We also find that objects from the inner parts of
the asteroid belt are more likely to become Sun-approacher than those from the
outer parts. We simulate the formation and evolution of the debris streams
produced from a set of synthetic disrupting asteroids drawn from Granvik et al.
(2016)'s near-Earth object population model, and find that they evolve 10--70
times faster than streams produced at ordinary solar distances. We compare the
simulation results to a catalog of known meteor showers on Sun-approaching
orbits. We show that there is a clear overabundance of Sun-approaching meteor
showers, which is best explained by a combining effect of comet contamination
and an extended disintegration phase that lasts up to a few kyrs. We suggest
that a few asteroid-like Sun-approaching objects that brighten significantly at
their perihelion passages could, in fact, be disrupting asteroids. An extended
period of thermal disruption may also explain the widespread detection of
transiting debris in exoplanetary systems. Data and codes that generate the

unstretched C3N sheet is higher in p-doping and its maximum value is obtained

X-ray galaxy clusters can be understood if we assume that the X-ray emission,
results from thermal bremsstrahlung from a hot diffuse intracluster gas with
temperatures about $10^8$ K. A fraction of it would not be bound to the cluster
and would escape as a wind. This hot wind can warm the local environment, the
thermal bath where the cluster is immersed. This mechanism can put all the
galaxy clusters within thermal baths, with almost the same effective
temperature, independent of the cluster redshift and it can be effective for

provide a unique opportunity for follow-up observations that enhance our

Attaining more burst spectra could lead to a better understanding of the origin
of these bright, millisecond-duration radio pulses. We therefore performed
$\sim$20 hr of simultaneous observations on FRB 121102 with the Effelsberg
100-m radio telescope and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to constrain the
spectral behaviour of bursts from FRB 121102 at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz. This
campaign resulted in the detection of nine new bursts at 1.4 GHz but no
simultaneous detections with LOFAR. Assuming that the ratio of the fluence at
two frequencies scales as a power law, we placed a lower limit of $\alpha$ >
-1.2 $\pm$ 0.4 on the spectral index for the fluence of the instantaneous broad
band emission of FRB 121102. For the derivation of this limit, a realistic
fluence detection threshold for LOFAR was determined empirically assuming a
burst would be scattered as predicted by the NE2001 model. A significant
variation was observed in the burst repeat rate R at L-band. During
observations in September 2016, nine bursts were detected, giving R = 1.1 $\pm$
0.4 hr$^{-1}$, while in November no bursts were detected, yielding R < 0.3
hr$^{-1}$ (95% confidence limit). This variation is consistent with earlier
seen episodic emission of FRB 121102. In a blind and targeted search, no bursts
were found with LOFAR at 150 MHz, resulting in a repeat rate limit of R < 0.16
hr$^{-1}$ (95% confidence limit). Burst repeat rate ratios of FRB 121102 at 3,
2, 1.4, and 0.15 GHz are consistent within the uncertainties with a flattening

acquiring signal from a macroscopic ensemble of molecules to gain information
about molecular structure and dynamics. Transferring this technique to
nanoscale sample sizes would enable molecular analysis without the effects of
averaging over spatial and temporal inhomogeneities and without the need for
macroscopic volumes of analyte, both inherent to large ensemble measurements.
Nanoscale NMR based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers inside bulk diamond chips
achieves single nuclear spin sensitivity and the resolution required to
determine chemical structure, but their detection volume is limited to a few
nanometers above the diamond surface for the most sensitive devices. This
precludes them from use for nuclear spin sensing with nanoscale resolution
inside thicker structures, such as cells. Here, we demonstrate the detection of
NMR signals from multiple nuclear species in a (19 nm)3 volume using versatile
NV-NMR devices inside nanodiamonds that have a typical 30 nm diameter. The
devices detect a signal generated by a small number of analyte molecules on the
order of 1000. To use these devices in situ, the detected signal must be
corrected for the unknown geometry of each nanodiamond device. We show that
such a calibration could be performed by exploiting the signal from a thin
layer of nuclei on the diamond surface. These results, combined with the low
toxicity of nanodiamonds and their amenability to surface functionalization,
indicate that nanodiamond NV-NMR devices could become a useful tool for
nanoscale NMR-based sensing inside living cells.

the form $Ax\leq 0$ on neural network activations. The proposed method allows a
data-driven training approach to be combined with modeling prior knowledge
about the task. One way to achieve this task is by means of a projection step
at test time after unconstrained training. However, this is an expensive
operation. By directly incorporating the constraints into the architecture, we
can significantly speed-up inference at test time; for instance, our
experiments show a speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude over a projection
method. Our algorithm computes a suitable parameterization of the feasible set
at initialization and uses standard variants of stochastic gradient descent to
find solutions to the constrained network. Thus, the modeling constraints are
always satisfied during training. Crucially, our approach avoids to solve an
optimization problem at each training step or to manually trade-off data and
constraint fidelity with additional hyperparameters. We consider constrained
generative modeling as an important application domain and experimentally
demonstrate the proposed method by constraining a variational autoencoder.

Trajectory Design (RTD) is a provably safe, real-time algorithm for trajectory

online part, where the FRS is used to map obstacles to constraints for
trajectory optimization in a provably-safe way. In the literature, RTD has only
been applied to small mobile robots. The contribution of this work is applying
RTD to a passenger vehicle in CarSim, with a full powertrain model, chassis and
tire dynamics. RTD produces safe trajectory plans with the vehicle traveling up
to 15 m/s on a two-lane road, with randomly-placed obstacles only known to the
vehicle when detected within its sensor horizon. RTD is compared with a

pp. 275--279]. We give simple testable criteria for the occurrence of
nonautonomous tipping from the herbivore-dominating equilibrium to the
plant-only equilibrium using global properties of the autonomous frozen system
with fixed-in-time parameters. To begin with, we use classical autonomous
bifurcation analysis to identify a codimension-three degenerate Bogdanov-Takens
bifurcation: the source of a dangerous subcritical Hopf bifurcation and the
organizing center for bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping). Then, we
introduce the concept of basin instability for equilibria to identify parameter
paths along which genuine nonautonomous rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs
without crossing any classical autonomous bifurcations. We explain
nonautonomous R-tipping in terms of maximal canard trajectories and produce
nonautonomous tipping diagrams in the plane of the magnitude and rate of a
parameter shift to uncover intriguing R-tipping tongues and wiggling
tipping-tracking bifurcation curves. Discussion of nontrivial dynamics arising
from the interaction between B-tipping and R-tipping identifies ""points of no
return"" where tipping cannot be prevented by the parameter trend reversal and
""points of return tipping"" where tipping is inadvertently induced by the
parameter trend reversal. Our results give new insight into the sensitivity of
ecosystems to the magnitudes and rates of environmental change. Finally, a
comparison between ""tilted"" saddle-node and subcritical Hopf normal forms
reveals some universal tipping properties due to basin instability, a generic
dangerous bifurcation, or the combination of both.

this suggestion numerically. Due to the complexity of the process direct
numerical simulations of the multiscale-multiphase problem are not possible.
Hence, we develop a numerical framework for a growing fiber in turbulent air

employ an asymptotic viscoelastic model for the fiber. The turbulent effects
are taken into account by a stochastic aerodynamic force model where the
underlying velocity fluctuations are reconstructed from a $k$-$\epsilon$

M-ary amplitude shift keying (MASK) modulation over Rician fading channels.
More specifically, we derive the optimum, near-optimum and a suboptimum AC
detectors and compare their SER to the coherent, noncoherent and the heuristic
AC detectors. Moreover, the analytical SER of the heuristic detector is derived
using two different approaches for single and multiple receiving antennas. One
of the derived expressions is expressed in terms of a single integral that can
be evaluated numerically, while the second approach gives a closed-form
analytical expression for the SER, which is also used to derive a simple
formula for the asymptotic SER at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The
obtained analytical and simulation results show that the SER of the AC and
coherent MASK detectors are comparable, particularly for high values of the
Rician K-factor, and small number of receiving antennas. Moreover, the obtained
results show that the SER of the optimal AC detector is equivalent to that of
the coherent detector. However, the optimal AC detector complexity is
prohibitively high, particularly at high SNRs. In most of the scenarios, the
heuristic AC detector significantly outperforms the optimum noncoherent
detector, except for the binary ASK case at low SNRs. Moreover, the obtained

value problems that uses a number of degrees of freedom which is as small as
for a low-order method. Standard isogeometric discretizations require a global
parameterization of the computational domain. In non-trivial cases, the domain
is decomposed into patches having separate parameterizations and separate
discretization spaces. If the discretization spaces agree on the interfaces
between the patches, the coupling can be done in a conforming way. Otherwise,
non-conforming discretizations (utilizing discontinuous Galerkin approaches)
are required. The author and his coworkers have previously introduced multigrid
solvers for Isogeometric Analysis for the conforming case. In the present
paper, these results are extended to the non-conforming case. Moreover, it is
shown that the multigrid solves get even more powerful if the proposed smoother
is combined with a (standard) Gauss-Seidel smoother.

matrices that exploit the low rank structure of matrix blocks at different
levels of granularity. The hierarchically low rank block partitioning produces
representations that can be stored and operated on in near-linear complexity
instead of the usual polynomial complexity of dense matrices. In this paper, we
present high performance implementations of matrix vector multiplication and
compression operations for the $\mathcal{H}^2$ variant of hierarchical matrices
on GPUs. This variant exploits, in addition to the hierarchical block
partitioning, hierarchical bases for the block representations and results in a
scheme that requires only $O(n)$ storage and $O(n)$ complexity for the mat-vec
and compression kernels. These two operations are at the core of algebraic
operations for hierarchical matrices, the mat-vec being a ubiquitous operation
in numerical algorithms while compression/recompression represents a key
building block for other algebraic operations, which require periodic
recompression during execution. The difficulties in developing efficient GPU
algorithms come primarily from the irregular tree data structures that underlie
the hierarchical representations, and the key to performance is to recast the
computations on flattened trees in ways that allow batched linear algebra
operations to be performed. This requires marshaling the irregularly laid out
data in a way that allows them to be used by the batched routines. Marshaling
operations only involve pointer arithmetic with no data movement and as a
result have minimal overhead. Our numerical results on covariance matrices from

Euclid, will soon exceed that available from the CMB. Higher order correlation
functions, like the bispectrum, will be indispensable for realising this
potential. The interpretation of this data faces many challenges because
gravitational collapse of matter is a complex non-linear process, typically
modelled by computationally expensive N-body simulations. Proposed alternatives
using fast dark matter codes (e.g. 2LPT or particle-mesh) are primarily
evaluated on their ability to reproduce clustering statistics linked to the
matter power spectrum. The accuracy of these codes can be tested in more detail
by looking at higher-order statistics, and in this paper we will present an
efficient and optimal methodology (MODAL-LSS) to reconstruct the full
bispectrum of any 3D density field. We make quantitative comparisons between a
number of fast dark matter codes and Gadget at redshift $z=0.5$. This will
serve as an important diagnostic tool for dark matter/halo mock catalogues and
lays the foundation for realistic high precision analysis with the galaxy
bispectrum. In particular, we show that the lack of small-scale power in the
bispectrum of fast codes can be ameliorated by a simple `boosting' technique
for the power spectrum. We also investigate the covariance of the MODAL-LSS
bispectrum estimator, demonstrating the plateauing of non-Gaussian errors in
contrast to simple Gaussian extrapolations. This has important consequences for
the extraction of information from the bispectrum and hence parameter
estimation. Finally we make quantitative comparisons of simulation bispectra
with theoretical models, discussing the initial parameters required to create
mock catalogues with accurate bispectra.

problem has applications in computational social science, viral marketing, and
people recommendation.
  In this paper we study the problem of inferring the strength of social ties
in a given network. Our work is motivated by a recent approach [27], which
leverages the strong triadic closure (STC) principle, a hypothesis rooted in
social psychology [13]. To guide our inference process, in addition to the
network structure, we also consider as input a collection of tight communities.
Those are sets of vertices that we expect to be connected via strong ties. Such
communities appear in different situations, e.g., when being part of a
community implies a strong connection to one of the existing members.
  We consider two related problem formalizations that reflect the assumptions
of our setting: small number of STC violations and strong-tie connectivity in
the input communities. We show that both problem formulations are NP-hard. We
also show that one problem formulation is hard to approximate, while for the
second we develop an algorithm with approximation guarantee. We validate the
proposed method on real-world datasets by comparing with baselines that
optimize STC violations and community connectivity separately.

successfully used to give new insights in statistical physics. Specifically, we
consider 3D lattice dimer model, which consists of sites forming a lattice and
bonds connecting the neighboring sites, in such a way that every bond can be
either empty or filled with a dimer, and the total number of dimers ending at
one site is fixed to be one. Dimer configurations can be viewed as equivalent
if they are connected through a series of local flips, i.e. simultaneous
'rotation' of a pair of parallel neighboring dimers. It turns out that the
whole set of dimer configurations on a given 3D lattice can be split into
distinct topological classes, such that dimer configurations belonging to
different classes are not equivalent. In this paper we identify these classes
by using neural networks. More specifically, we train the neural networks to
distinguish dimer configurations from two known topological classes, and after
it, we test them on dimer configurations from unknown topological classes. We
demonstrate that 3D lattice dimer model on a bipartite lattice can be described
by an integer topological invariant ('Hopf number'), whereas lattice dimer
model on a non-bipartite lattice is described by $Z_2$ invariant. Thus, we
demonstrate that neural networks can be successfully used to identify new

optimization algorithms (such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics and

other contexts, including PAC-Bayesian theory, and sampling mechanisms. In this
work we study the excess risk suffered by a Gibbs-ERM learner that uses
non-convex, regularized empirical risk with the goal to understand the
interplay between the data-generating distribution and learning in large
hypothesis spaces. Our main results are distribution-dependent upper bounds on
several notions of excess risk. We show that, in all cases, the
distribution-dependent excess risk is essentially controlled by the effective
dimension $\mathrm{tr}\left(\boldsymbol{H}^{\star} (\boldsymbol{H}^{\star} +
\lambda \boldsymbol{I})^{-1}\right)$ of the problem, where
$\boldsymbol{H}^{\star}$ is the Hessian matrix of the risk at a local minimum.
This is a well-established notion of effective dimension appearing in several
previous works, including the analyses of SGD and ridge regression, but ours is
the first work that brings this dimension to the analysis of learning using
Gibbs densities. The distribution-dependent view we advocate here improves upon
earlier results of Raginsky et al. (2017), and can yield much tighter bounds
depending on the interplay between the data-generating distribution and the
loss function. The first part of our analysis focuses on the localized excess
risk in the vicinity of a fixed local minimizer. This result is then extended
to bounds on the global excess risk, by characterizing probabilities of local
minima (and their complement) under Gibbs densities, a results which might be
of independent interest.

diffusive Seebeck coefficient Sdiff(T) with the Boltzmann equation resolved in
relaxation time approximation, taking into account the scattering with phonons
and impurities, the effect of renormalization and the effect doping in a rigid
band approximation. We show that selective disorder has a sizeable effect on
the Sdiff magnitude, as it tunes the relative contributions of sigma and pi
bands. Disorder also affects the Sdiff temperature dependences, eventually
yielding a linear Sdiff(T) behavior in the dirty limit. We also show that band
filling has opposite effects on S, depending on which band dominates transport.
In parallel, we carry out Seebeck effect measurements on neutron-irradiated
Mg11B2, and on two series of doped samples Mg1-xAlxB2 and Mg(B1-xCx)2. From
comparison of calculated Sdiff(T) and experimental S(T) curves, we demonstrate
that diffusive and phonon drag terms give comparable contributions in clean
samples, but the phonon drag term is progressively suppressed with increasing
disorder. In C and Al doped samples we observe very different experimental
behaviors in terms of sign, magnitude and temperature dependence. Indeed,
notwithstanding the similar electron doping introduced by both substitutions, C
or Al doping yields disorder which mainly affects either sigma or pi bands,
respectively. With the help of our ab-initio approach, we are able to
disentangle the several effects and prove that Seebeck coefficient is a very
sensitive probe of the kind of disorder.

vessels. For some time now, devices called stents have been used to re-open the

this treatment has disadvantages like developing intra-stent restenosis and
progression of the atherosclerosis, clogging the blood vessel again. For these
reasons it is necessary to develop new materials and strategies focused on the
prevention and correction of this pathology and its subsequent complications.
In the present work, a reduction and in situ nitrogen doping method in graphene
oxide (N-rGO) was studied. By means of XPS a 9.57% at of nitrogen doping was
demonstrated and was found that the pyrrole type nitrogen is predominant. Due
to nitrogen doping and pyrrolic sites, the N-rGO surface reached high levels of
negative electric charge, which was verified by Electrostatic Force Microscopy
(EFM) and wettability tests between the LDL at different oxidation levels and
the synthesized N-rGO; contact angles between 95.7{\deg} and 130.4{\deg} were
obtained which indicates repulsion between both materials. The N-rGO was also
characterized by SEM and TEM where a wrinkled morphology typical of this type
of material was observed and the hexagonal atomic arrangement of GO is

which can be solved exactly. In the quantum dimer model, the electric field
line is mapped onto a two-leg spin 1/2 ladder, which we study using numerical
exact diagonalization. Our findings are consistent with the existence of three
distinct phases including a Luttinger liquid phase, the one-dimensional
precursor to the two-dimensional plaquette valence bond solid. The uncanny
resemblance of our quasi-one-dimensional electric field line problem to the
full two-dimensional problem suggests that much of the behavior of the latter
might be understood by thinking of it as a closely packed array of field lines
which themselves are undergoing non-trivial phase transitions.

clouds orbiting on the 100-pc stream of the Central Molecular Zone (the central
$\sim500$ pc of the Galaxy) and characterise their morphological and kinematic
evolution in response to the background potential and eccentric orbital motion.
We find that the clouds are shaped by strong shear and torques, by tidal and
geometric deformation, and by their passage through the orbital pericentre.
Within our simulations, these mechanisms control cloud sizes, aspect ratios,
position angles, filamentary structure, column densities, velocity dispersions,
line-of-sight velocity gradients, spin angular momenta, and kinematic
complexity. By comparing these predictions to observations of clouds on the
Galactic Centre 'dust ridge', we find that our simulations naturally reproduce
a broad range of key observed morphological and kinematic features, which can
be explained in terms of well-understood physical mechanisms. We argue that the
accretion of gas clouds onto the central regions of galaxies, where the
rotation curve turns over and the tidal field is fully compressive, is
accompanied by transformative dynamical changes to the clouds, leading to
collapse and star formation. This can generate an evolutionary progression of
cloud collapse with a common starting point, which either marks the time of
accretion onto the tidally-compressive region or of the most recent pericentre
passage. Together, these processes may naturally produce the synchronised
starbursts observed in numerous (extra)galactic nuclei.

function with typical parameters. Starting on ~4 s post-trigger, we find an
additional nonthermal component, which can be fit by a power law. This
component rises and decays quickly. The 10 keV -- 40 MeV flux of the power-law

of the peak coincides with the emission peak detected by the Large Area

spectral energy distribution seems to be consistent with a single component.
This suggests that the LAT emission and the power-law component that we find in

to the afterglow of the burst. The onset time allows us to estimate the initial
jet bulk Lorentz factor Gamma_0 is about 500, depending on the assumed

property needed to place a RSG on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, due to the
stars' cool temperatures and resulting large bolometric corrections. Several
recent papers have examined the potential utility of atomic line equivalent
widths in cool supergiant spectra for determining $T_{\rm eff}$ and other
physical properties (dorda2016b, dorda2016a) and found strong correlations
between Ti I and Fe I spectral features and $T_{\rm eff}$ in earlier-type cool
supergiants (G and early K) but poor correlations in M-type stars, a spectral
subtype that makes up a significant fraction of RSGs. We have extended this
work by measuring the equivalent widths of Ti, Fe, and Ca lines in late K- and
M-type RSGs in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, and Small Magellanic

atmosphere models. Our analyses show a poor correlation between $T_{\rm eff}$
and the Fe I and Ti I lines in our observations (at odds with strong

significant correlations between $T_{\rm eff}$ and the Ca II triplet (CaT)
features of Milky Way RSGs, suggesting that this could be a potential
diagnostic tool for determining $T_{\rm eff}$ in M type supergiants. We also
examine correlations between these spectral features and other physical
properties of RSGs (including metallicity, surface gravity, and bolometric
magnitude), and consider the underlying physics driving the evolution of atomic

very few sources. A promising way to study the significance of cold accretion

present ALMA CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) observations of the Hydra-A brightest cluster
galaxy (z=0.054) which reveal the existence of cold, molecular gas clouds along
the line-of-sight to the galaxy's extremely bright and compact mm-continuum

hole of between -43 and -4 km s$^{-1}$ and are most likely moving along stable,
low ellipticity orbits. The identified clouds form part of a $\sim$$10^{9}$

ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks, such as produced by flare ejecta from
young magnetars. We combine PIC simulation results for the synchrotron maser
with the dynamics of self-similar shock deceleration, as commonly applied to
GRBs, to explore the implications for FRB emission. We assume the upstream
environment into which the ultra-relativistic ejecta collides is a mildly
relativistic baryon-loaded shell released following a previous flare, motivated
by the high electron-ion injection rate Mdot ~ 1e19-1e21 g/s needed on larger
scales to power the persistent radio nebula coincident with the repeating
burster FRB 121102 and its high inferred rotation measure. The observed radio
fluence peaks once the optical depth ahead of the shock to induced Compton
scattering decreases to <~ few, a condition which places a GHz observer on the
high frequency tail of the maser SED. Given intervals between ion shell
ejection events ~1e5 s similar to the occurrence rate of the most powerful
bursts from FRB 121102, we demonstrate the production of FRBs of frequency ~
0.1-10 GHz, isotropic radiated energies ~1e37-1e40 erg and durations ~0.1-10 ms
for flares of energy ~1e43-1e45 erg. Deceleration of the blast wave, and
increasing transparency of the upstream medium, generates a temporal decay of
the peak frequency, similar to the downward drift seen in the sub-bursts of FRB
121102 and FRB 180814.J0422+73. The delay >~ 1e5 s between major ion-injection
events needed to clear sufficiently low densities around the engine for FRB
emission could explain prolonged ""dark"" periods and clustered burst arrival
times, and lead to stochastic variation in the dispersion measure. Thermal

enhanced amplitude of density fluctuations caused by the fifth force present in

below their free-streaming length. Both effects take place on comparable
scales, and uncertainty in the neutrino mass leads to a degeneracy with
modified gravity parameters for probes that are measuring the amplitude of the
matter power spectrum. We explore the possibility to break the degeneracy
between modified gravity and neutrino effects in the growth of structures by
considering kinematic information related to either the growth rate on large
scales or the virial velocities inside of collapsed structures. In order to
study the degeneracy up to fully non-linear scales, we employ a suite of
$N$-body simulations including both $f(R)$ modified gravity and massive
neutrinos. Our results indicate that velocity information provides an excellent
tool to distinguish massive neutrinos from modified gravity. Models with
different values of neutrino masses and modified gravity parameters possessing
a comparable matter power spectrum at a given time have different growth rates.
This leaves imprints in the velocity divergence, which is therefore better
suited than the amplitude of density fluctuations to tell the models apart. In
such models with a power spectrum comparable to $\Lambda$CDM today, the growth
rate is strictly enhanced. We also find the velocity dispersion of virialised
clusters to be well suited to constrain deviations from general relativity

detected by SPHERE at around 100 au from its host. Explaining the presence of
super-Jovian planets at large separations, as revealed by direct imaging, is
currently an open question.
  We want to derive statistical constraints on the mass and initial entropy of
HIP65426b and to explore possible formation pathways of directly imaged objects
within the core-accretion paradigm, focusing on HIP65426b.
  Constraints on the planet's mass and post-formation entropy are derived from
its age and luminosity combined with cooling models. For the first time, the
results of population synthesis are also used to inform the results. Then, a
formation model that includes N-body dynamics with several embryos per disc is
used to study possible formation histories and the properties of possible
additional companions. Finally, the outcomes of two- and three-planet
scattering in the post-disc phase are analysed, taking tides into account.
  The mass of HIP65426b is found to be Mp = 9.9 +1.1 -1.8 MJ using the hot
population and Mp = 10.9 +1.4 -2.0 MJ with the cold-nominal population. Core
formation at small separations from the star followed by outward scattering and
runaway accretion at a few hundred AU succeeds in reproducing the mass and
separation of HIP65426b. Alternatively, systems having two or more giant
planets close enough to be on an unstable orbit at disc dispersal are likely to
end up with one planet on a wide HIP65426b-like orbit with a relatively high
eccentricity (>~ 0.5).
  If this scattering scenario explains its formation, HIP65426b is predicted to
have a high eccentricity and to be accompanied by one or several roughly
Jovian-mass planets at smaller semi-major axes, which also could have a high
eccentricity. This could be tested by further direct-imaging as well as
radial-velocity observations.

allow sectors with sensitive data to utilize the cloud and securely deploy
their models for remote inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However,
this application faces several obstacles due to the limitations of LHE. One of
the main problems is the incompatibility of commonly used nonlinear functions
in DNN with the operations supported by LHE, i.e. addition and multiplication.
As common in LHE approaches, we train a model with a nonlinear function, and
replace it with a low-degree polynomial approximation at inference time on
private data. While this typically leads to approximation errors and loss in
prediction accuracy, we propose a method that reduces this loss to small values
or eliminates it entirely, depending on simple hyper-parameters. This is
achieved by the introduction of a novel and elegantly simple Min-Max
normalization scheme, which scales inputs to nonlinear functions into ranges
with low approximation error. While being intuitive in its concept and trivial
to implement, we empirically show that it offers a stable and effective
approximation solution to nonlinear functions in DNN. In return, this can
enable deeper networks with LHE, and facilitate the development of security-
and privacy-aware analytics applications.

currently in progress using the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt Telescope. ZTF uses a
47 square degree field with a 600 megapixel camera to scan the entire northern
visible sky at rates of ~3760 square degrees/hour to median depths of g ~ 20.8
and r ~ 20.6 mag (AB, 5sigma in 30 sec). We describe the Science Data System
that is housed at IPAC, Caltech. This comprises the data-processing pipelines,
alert production system, data archive, and user interfaces for accessing and
analyzing the products. The realtime pipeline employs a novel
image-differencing algorithm, optimized for the detection of point source
transient events. These events are vetted for reliability using a
machine-learned classifier and combined with contextual information to generate
data-rich alert packets. The packets become available for distribution
typically within 13 minutes (95th percentile) of observation. Detected events
are also linked to generate candidate moving-object tracks using a novel
algorithm. Objects that move fast enough to streak in the individual exposures
are also extracted and vetted. The reconstructed astrometric accuracy per
science image with respect to Gaia is typically 45 to 85 milliarcsec. This is
the RMS per axis on the sky for sources extracted with photometric S/N >= 10.
The derived photometric precision (repeatability) at bright unsaturated fluxes
varies between 8 and 25 millimag. Photometric calibration accuracy with respect
to Pan-STARRS1 is generally better than 2%. The products support a broad range
of scientific applications: fast and young supernovae, rare flux transients,
variable stars, eclipsing binaries, variability from active galactic nuclei,
counterparts to gravitational wave sources, a more complete census of Type Ia
supernovae, and Solar System objects.

by a hierarchy between the participants. Discovering hierarchy from a given
directed network can be formulated as follows: partition vertices into levels
such that, ideally, there are only forward edges, that is, edges from upper
levels to lower levels. In practice, the ideal case is impossible, so instead
we minimize some penalty function on the backward edges. One practical option
for such a penalty is agony, where the penalty depends on the severity of the
violation. In this paper we extend the definition of agony to temporal
networks. In this setup we are given a directed network with time stamped
edges, and we allow the rank assignment to vary over time. We propose 2
strategies for controlling the variation of individual ranks. In our first
variant, we penalize the fluctuation of the rankings over time by adding a
penalty directly to the optimization function. In our second variant we allow
the rank change at most once. We show that the first variant can be solved
exactly in polynomial time while the second variant is NP-hard, and in fact
inapproximable. However, we develop an iterative method, where we first fix the
change point and optimize the ranks, and then fix the ranks and optimize the
change points, and reiterate until convergence. We show empirically that the
algorithms are reasonably fast in practice, and that the obtained rankings are
sensible.

dithering of the deformable mirrors to increase phase diversity. A scheme based

maintaining the dark hole during the integration phase. For the post-processing

the planetary signals. We tested different methods for mitigating the stellar
activity contribution to the radial velocity time variations and measuring the
planet masses with good precision. We found that K2-36 is likely a $\sim$1 Gyr

desirable to optimize for the undiscounted return - in settings like Atari, for
instance, the goal is to collect the most points while staying alive in the
long run. Yet, it may be difficult (or even intractable) mathematically to
learn with this target. As such, temporal discounting is often applied to
optimize over a shorter effective planning horizon. This comes at the risk of
potentially biasing the optimization target away from the undiscounted goal. In
settings where this bias is unacceptable - where the system must optimize for
longer horizons at higher discounts - the target of the value function
approximator may increase in variance leading to difficulties in learning. We
present an extension of temporal difference (TD) learning, which we call
TD($\Delta$), that breaks down a value function into a series of components
based on the differences between value functions with smaller discount factors.
The separation of a longer horizon value function into these components has
useful properties in scalability and performance. We discuss these properties

the point source limit and for given shape of the disturbance quantified by the
Froude number $F$. We show that within linear theory effect of arbitrary
disturbance on the wake pattern can be mimicked by an effective pressure
distribution. Further, resulting wake patterns are qualitatively different
depending on whether water-piercing is present or not (""sharp"" vs ""smooth""
disturbances). For smooth pressure sources, we generalize Kelvin's stationary
phase argument to encompass finite size effects and classify resulting wake
patterns. Specifically, we show that there exist two characteristic Froude
numbers, $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}>F_{1}$, such as the wake is only present if
$F\gtrsim F_{1}$. For $F_{1}\lesssim F \lesssim F_{2}$, the wake consists of
the transverse wavefronts confined within a sector of an angle that may be
smaller than Kelvin's. An additional $39^{\circ}$ wake made of both the
transverse and diverging wavefronts is found for $F\gtrsim F_{2}$. If the
pressure source has sharp boundary, the wake is always present and features
additional interference effects. Specifically, for a constant pressure line
segment source mimicking slender ship the wake pattern can be understood as due
to two opposing effect wakes resembling (but not identical to) Kelvin's and
originating at segment's ends.

mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials. Not as well-known is how
different GBs interact with dislocations to influence dislocation movement.
This work presents a molecular dynamics study of 33 different FCC Ni
bicrystals, each subjected to four different strain states to induce incident
dislocation-GB interactions for 132 unique configurations. The resulting
simulations are analyzed to determine properties of the interaction that affect
the likelihood of transmission of the dislocation through the GB in an effort
to better inform mesoscale models of dislocation movement within polycrystals.
It is found that the ability to predict the slip system of a transmitted
dislocation using common geometric criteria is confirmed. Furthermore, machine
learning processes are implemented revealing that geometric properties, such as
the minimum potential residual Burgers vector (RBV) and the disorientation
between the two grains, are stronger indicators of whether or not a dislocation
would transmit than other properties, such as the resolved shear stress.

carbon in the ejecta, a method that cannot be readily compared against model
predictions because it requires assumed opacities and temperatures. Here, we
instead use tomographic techniques to investigate the amount of carbon in the
inner layers of SN~2011fe, starting from the previously published tomographic
analysis of Mazzali et al. From the presence of the carbon feature in the

coding for joint error correction and cooperative network coding on non-binary

channel coded messages received each in a time slot from all sources before
applying network coding (NC) by the use of bit-level exclusive OR (XOR)
operation. The network coded resulting message is then channel encoded before
its transmission to the next relay or to the destination according to the
network configuration. This scenario shows superior performance in comparison
with the case where the relay does not perform channel coding/decoding. For
different orders of PSK modulation and different wireless configurations,
simulation results demonstrate the improvements resulting from the use of RS

modal instability of the streamwise mean cross-flow $U(y,z,t)$, non-modal
transient growth, and non-modal transient growth supported by parametric
instability. We have designed three numerical experiments of plane turbulent
channel flow with additional forcing terms aiming to neutralize one or various
linear mechanisms for energy extraction. From our preliminary experiments, only
cases with mean cross-flows capable of supporting modal instabilities were
found to sustain turbulence. However, the question whether such a new
turbulence complies with the same physical mechanisms as those occurring in
actual (unforced) turbulence remains unanswered. On the other hand, cases
exclusively supported by transient growth decayed until laminarization.

U(theta_n) and D(theta_n), characterized by perovskite tilts where one of the

possible maps in the well-known mathematical four-color theorem. Both the
periodic striped puddles and random structures can be represented by using
$planar$ graphs with a chromatic number. To observe the colors in mapping
experiments, it is necessary to recover variously oriented tilting effects from
the replica. It is established that there is an interplay between the
annihilation/creation of new stripes and ordering/disordering tilts in relation
to the theta _n angle in the CuO2 plane, where the characteristic shape of the
stripes coincides with the tilting-ordered regions. By their origin, the
boundaries between the stripes should be atomically sharp.

In this paper, we exploit an oft-overlooked degree of freedom in most networks
- for a given layer, individual output channels can be scaled by any factor
provided that the corresponding weights of the next layer are inversely scaled.
Therefore, a given network has many factorizations which change the weights of
the network without changing its function. We present a conceptually simple and
easy to implement method that uses this property and show that proper
factorizations significantly decrease the degradation caused by quantization.
We show improvement on a wide variety of networks and achieve state-of-the-art
degradation results for MobileNets. While our focus is on quantization, this
type of factorization is applicable to other domains such as network-pruning,
neural nets regularization and network interpretability.

of nanoparticles due to suprathermal rotation of grains in stationary C-shocks,
which is termed rotational disruption. In this paper, we extend our previous
study for non-stationary shocks driven by outflows and young supernovae
remnants that have dynamical ages shorter than the time required to establish a
stationary C-shock, which is composed of a C-shock and a J-shock tail (referred
as CJ-shock). For the C-shock component, we find that smallest nanoparticles
(size $\lesssim 1$ nm) of weak materials (i.e., tensile strength $S_{\rm max}
\lesssim 10^{9}\ \rm erg\ cm^{-3}$) can be rotationally disrupted due to
suprathermal rotation induced by supersonic neutral drift. For the J-shock
component, although nanoparticles are rotating thermally, the smallest ones can
still be disrupted because the gas is heated to higher temperatures by
J-shocks. We then model microwave emission from rapidly spinning nanoparticles
where the grain size distribution has the lower cutoff determined by rotational
disruption for the different shock models. We also calculate the spectral flux
of microwave emission from a shocked region at distance of 100 pc from the
observer for the different gas density, shock age, and shock velocities. We
suggest that microwave emission from spinning dust can be used to trace
nanoparticles and shock velocities in dense molecular outflows. Finally, we
discuss a new way that can release molecules from the nanoparticle surface into
the gas in the shocked regions, which we name rotational desorption.

attain channel capacity with infinite codeword lengths. Finite length polar
codes have been adopted into the 5th Generation 3GPP standard for New Radio,
though their native length is limited to powers of 2. Utilizing multiple
polarizing matrices increases the length flexibility of polar codes at the
expense of a more complicated decoding process. Successive cancellation (SC) is
the standard polar decoder and has time complexity $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ due
to its sequential nature. However, some patterns in the frozen set mirror
simple linear codes with low latency decoders, which allows for a significant
reduction in SC latency by pruning the decoding schedule. Such fast decoding
techniques have only previously been used for traditional Arikan polar codes,
causing multi-kernel polar codes to be an impractical length-compatibility
technique with no fast decoders available. We propose fast simplified
successive cancellation decoding node patterns, which are compatible with polar
codes constructed with both the Arikan and ternary kernels, and generalization
techniques. We outline efficient implementations, made possible by imposing
constraints on ternary node parameters. We show that fast decoding of
multi-kernel polar codes has at least 72% reduced latency compared with an SC
decoder in all cases considered where codeword lengths are (96, 432, 768,

the smallest sized gold clusters was studied using ultrafast transient
absorption spectroscopy and theoretical modeling. The electron dynamics in
Au279, Au329, and Au329 passivated with TBBT, SC2Ph and SC6, respectively, were
investigated. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements were also carried out
on Au~1400 (SC6) and Au~2000 (SC6) to understand the influence of the size on
electron-phonon relaxation with the same passivating ligand. The study has
revealed interesting aspects on the role of ligand on electron-phonon
relaxation dynamics wherein the aromatic passivating ligands, SC2Ph and TBBT,
have shown smaller power dependence and higher plasmon bleach indicating
dampened plasmon resonance while the cluster with aliphatic passivating ligand
has behaved similarly to regular plasmonic gold nanoparticles. To model the
effect of the ligand on the plasmonic properties of the investigated samples ,
free electron density correction factor of each one was calculated using
three-layered Mie theory, and the results show that SC6 inter-acts least with
core-gold while TBBT and SC2Ph have a greater effect on the surface electronic
conductivity that is attributed to pi-interaction of the ligand with gold. The
results also shed light on unusual electron-phonon relaxation and smaller slope
observed for Au329 (SC2Ph) that is ascribed to surface gold-pi interaction
creating a hybrid state. In contrast, extended pi-interaction is probably the
reason for plasmonic nature observed in Au279 (TBBT) even though its size is
smaller when compared to Au329. In addition, the results also have shown that
the electron-phonon coupling has increased with an increase in the size of the
cluster and theoretical modeling has shown higher electron conductivity for
larger plasmonic gold clusters.

superconductivity of the surface sheath. We here report a high-pressure study,
$p \leq 2.5$ GPa, of the superconducting phase diagram extracted from
ac-susceptibility and transport measurements on single crystalline samples.
$T_c (p)$ shows a pronounced non-monotonous variation with a maximum $T_c =
$1.91 K around 0.91 GPa, followed by a gradual decrease to 1.27 K at 2.5 GPa.
The critical field of bulk superconductivity in the limit $T \rightarrow 0$,
$H_c(0,p)$, follows a similar trend and consequently the $H_c(T,p)$-curves
under pressure collapse on a single curve: $H_c(T,p)=H_c(0,p)[1-(T/T_c(p))^2]$.
Surface superconductivity is robust under pressure as demonstrated by the large
superconducting screening signal that persists for applied dc-fields $H_a >
H_c$. Surprisingly, for $p \geq 1.41$ GPa the superconducting transition
temperature at the surface $T_c^S$ is larger than $T_c$ of the bulk. Therefore
surface superconductivity may possibly have a non-trivial nature and is
connected to the topological surface states detected by ARPES. We compare the
measured pressure variation of $T_c$ with recent results from band structure

location of microbubbles in flow by using acoustic radiation force. Targeted
drug delivery methods are expected to benefit from the use of the ultrasonic
trap, since trapping will increase the MB concentration at a desired location

  The ultrasonic trap was generated by using an ultrasound research system UARP
II and a linear array transducer. The trap was designed asymmetrically to
produces a weaker radiation force at the inlet of the trap to further
facilitate microbubble entrance. A pulse sequence was generated that can switch
between a long duration trapping waveform and short duration imaging waveform.
High frame rate plane wave imaging was chosen for monitoring trapped
microbubbles at 1 kHz. The working principle of the ultrasonic trap was
explained and demonstrated in an ultrasound phantom by injecting SonoVue

Burrows-Wheeler transformation have been introduced. Some of these index
structures far more complex than a single string, as was originally done with
the FM-index [Ferragina and Manzini, J. ACM 2005]. As such, there has been an
effort to better understand under which conditions such an indexing scheme is
possible. This led to the introduction of Wheeler graphs [Gagie it et al.,
Theor. Comput. Sci., 2017]. A Wheeler graph is a directed graph with edge
labels which satisfies two simple axioms. Wheeler graphs can be indexed in a
way which is space efficient and allows for fast traversal. Gagie et al. showed
that de Bruijn graphs, generalized compressed suffix arrays, and several other
BWT related structures can be represented as Wheeler graphs. Here we answer the
open question of whether or not there exists an efficient algorithm for
recognizing if a graph is a Wheeler graph. We demonstrate:(i) Recognizing if a
graph is a Wheeler graph is NP-complete for any edge label alphabet of size
$\sigma \geq 2$, even for DAGs. It can be solved in linear time for $\sigma
=1$; (ii) An optimization variant called Wheeler Graph Violation (WGV) which
aims to remove the minimum number of edges needed to obtain a Wheeler graph is
APX-hard, even for DAGs. Hence, unless P = NP, there exists constant $C > 1$
such that there is no $C$-approximation algorithm. We show conditioned on the
Unique Games Conjecture, for every constant $C \geq 1$, it is NP-hard to find a
$C$-approximation to WGV; (iii) The Wheeler Subgraph problem (WS) which aims to
find the largest Wheeler subgraph is in APX for $\sigma=O(1)$; (iv) For the
above problems there exist efficient exponential time exact algorithms, relying
on graph isomorphism being computed in strictly sub-exponential time; (v) A
class of graphs where the recognition problem is polynomial time solvable.

monolayers, while it has the minimum average atomic mass, which is in contrast
with the common assumption that lower mass systems exhibit higher thermal

anharmonic phonon properties in determining the variation of the thermal
conductivity among \b{eta}-NX (X=P, As, Sb) monolayers. The higher

use data assimilation, a nonlinear regression that projects data onto a

sparse, non-stationary clinical data. However, physiological models are often
nonlinear and can have many parameters, leading to potential problems with
parameter identifiability, or the ability to find a unique set of parameters
that minimize forecasting error. The identifiability problems can be minimized
or eliminated by reducing the number of parameters estimated, but reducing the
number of estimated parameters also reduces the flexibility of the model and
hence increases forecasting error. We propose a method, the parameter Houlihan,
that combines traditional machine learning techniques with data assimilation,
to select the right set of model parameters to minimize forecasting error while
reducing identifiability problems. The method worked well: the data
assimilation-based glucose forecasts and estimates for our cohort using the
Houlihan-selected parameter sets generally also minimize forecasting errors
compared to other parameter selection methods such as by-hand parameter
selection. Nevertheless, the forecast with the lowest forecast error does not
always accurately represent physiology, but further advancements of the
algorithm provide a path for improving physiologic fidelity as well. Our hope
is that this methodology represents a first step toward combining machine
learning with data assimilation and provides a lower-threshold entry point for
using data assimilation with clinical data by helping select the right
parameters to estimate.

public health, are prompting urban and transportation planners to turn to land
use and urban design to rein in automobile use. One of the implicit beliefs in
this effort is that the right land-use policies will, in fact, help to reduce
automobile use and increase the use of alternative modes of transportation.
Thus, planners and transport engineers are increasingly viewing land use
policies and lifestyle patterns as a way to manage transportation demand. While
a substantial body of work has looked at the relationship between the built
environment and travel behaviour, as well as the influence of lifestyles and
lifestyle-related decisions on using different travel modes and activity
behaviours, limited work has been done in capturing these effects
simultaneously and also in exploring the effect of intra-household interaction
on individual attitudes and beliefs towards travel and activity behavior, and
their subsequent influence on lifestyles and modality styles. Therefore, for
this study we proposed a framework that captures the concurrent influence of
lifestyles and modality styles on both household-level decisions, such as
neighbourhood location, and individual-level decisions, such as travel mode
choices using a hierarchical Latent Class Choice Model.

parameters such as the number of clusters, a scaling parameter for the affinity

automating the process of spectral clustering, the task of grouping data in
multi-scale and higher dimensional spaces is yet to be explored. This study
presents a spectral clustering heuristic algorithm that obviates the need for
an input by estimating the parameters from the data itself. Specifically, it
introduces the heuristic of iterative eigengap search with (1) global scaling
and (2) local scaling. These approaches estimate the scaling parameter and
implement iterative eigengap quantification along a search tree to reveal
dissimilarities at different scales of a feature space and identify clusters.
The performance of these approaches has been tested on various real-world
datasets of power variation with multi-scale nature and gene expression. Our
findings show that iterative eigengap search with a PCA-based global scaling
scheme can discover different patterns with an accuracy of higher than 90% in
most cases without asking for a priori input information.

Bond number Bo $\ll$ 1 is studied both experimentally and numerically. First,
we measure the flow fields near the substrate by micro-PIV for both sessile and
pendant droplets during the evaporation process, which surprisingly show
opposite radial flow directions -- inward and outward, respectively. This
observation clearly reveals that in spite of the small droplet size,
gravitational effects play a crucial role in controlling the flow fields in the
evaporating droplets. We theoretically analyze that this gravity-driven effect
is triggered by the lower volatility of glycerol which leads to a preferential
evaporation of water then the local concentration difference of the two
components leads to a density gradient that drives the convective flow. We show
that the Archimedes number Ar is the nondimensional control parameter for the
occurrence of the gravitational effects. We confirm our hypothesis by
experimentally comparing two evaporating microdroplet systems, namely a
glycerol-water droplet and a 1,2-propanediol-water droplet. We obtain different
Ar, larger or smaller than a unit by varying a series of droplet heights, which
corresponds to cases with or without gravitational effects, respectively.
Finally, we simulate the process numerically, finding good agreement with the
experimental results and again confirming our interpretation.

robust layers to their initial values does not result in adverse decline in
performance. In many cases, robust layers hardly change throughout training. In

the network with test error essentially dropping to random guesses. Our study
provides further evidence that mere parameter counting or norm calculations are
too coarse in studying generalization of deep models, and ""flatness"" and

Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.3847/2041-8213/ab22bb",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.EP astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Protostellar flares are rapid magnetic energy release events associated with
formation of hot plasma in protostars. In the previous models of protostellar
flares, the interaction between a protostellar magnetosphere with the
surrounding disk plays crucial roles in building-up and releasing the magnetic
energy. However, it remains unclear if protostars indeed have magnetospheres
because vigorous disk accretion and strong disk magnetic fields in the
protostellar phase may destroy the magnetosphere. Considering this possibility,
we investigate the energy accumulation and release processes in the absence of
a magnetosphere using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation. Our
simulation reveals that protostellar flares are repeatedly produced even in
such a case. Unlike in the magnetospheric models, the protostar accumulates
magnetic energy by acquiring large-scale magnetic fields from the disk by
accretion. Protostellar flares occur when a portion of the large-scale magnetic
fields are removed from the protostar as a result of magnetic reconnection.
Protostellar flares in the simulation are consistent with observations; the
released magnetic energy (up to $\sim 3\times 10^{38}$ erg) is large enough to
drive observed flares, and the flares produce hot ejecta. The expelled magnetic
fields enhance accretion, and the energy build-up and release processes are
repeated as a result. The magnetic flux removal via reconnection leads to
redistribution of magnetic fields in the inner disk. We therefore consider that
protostellar flares will play an important role in the evolution of the disk
magnetic fields in the vicinity of protostars.

progress is limited. Significant recent progress toward average versions of the
$\ell$-torsion conjecture has crucially relied on counts for number fields,
raising interest in how these two types of question relate. In this paper we
make explicit the quantitative relationships between the $\ell$-torsion
conjecture and other well-known conjectures: the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics,
counts for number fields of fixed discriminant, counts for number fields of
bounded discriminant (or related invariants), and counts for elliptic curves
with fixed conductor. All of these considerations reinforce that we expect the
$\ell$-torsion conjecture is true, despite limited progress toward it. Our
perspective focuses on the relation between pointwise bounds, averages, and
higher moments, and demonstrates the broad utility of the ""method of moments.""

estimation (DSSE), full observability and redundant measurements are difficult
to achieve without using the pseudo measurements. The matrix completion state
estimation (MCSE) combines the matrix completion and power system model to
estimate voltage by exploring the low-rank characteristics of the matrix. This
paper proposes a robust matrix completion state estimation (RMCSE) to estimate
the voltage in a distribution system under a low-observability condition.
Tradition state estimation weighted least squares (WLS) method requires full
observability to calculate the states and needs redundant measurements to
proceed a bad data detection. The proposed method improves the robustness of
the MCSE to bad data by minimizing the rank of the matrix and measurements
residual with different weights. It can estimate the system state in a
low-observability system and has robust estimates without the bad data
detection process in the face of multiple bad data. The method is numerically
evaluated on the IEEE 33-node radial distribution system. The estimation
performance and robustness of RMCSE are compared with the WLS with the largest
normalized residual bad data identification (WLS-LNR), and the MCSE.

sports. We provide the first comprehensive study of pace within the sport of
hockey, focusing on how teams and players impact pace in different regions of
the ice, and the resultant effect on other aspects of the game.
  First we examined how pace of play varies across the surface of the rink,
across different periods, at different manpower situations, between different
professional leagues, and through time between seasons. Our analysis of pace by
zone helps to explain some of the counter-intuitive results reported in prior
studies. For instance, we show that the negative correlation between attacking
speed and shots/goals is likely due to a large decline in attacking speed in
the OZ.
  We also studied how pace impacts the outcomes of various events. We found
that pace is positively-correlated with both high-danger zone entries (e.g.
odd-man rushes) and higher shot quality. However, we find that passes with
failed receptions occur at higher speeds than successful receptions. These
findings suggest that increased pace is beneficial, but perhaps only up to a
certain extent. Higher pace can create breakdowns in defensive structure and
lead to better scoring chances but can also lead to more turnovers.
  Finally, we analyzed team and player-level pace in the NHL, highlighting the
considerable variability in how teams and players attack and defend against
pace. Taken together, our results demonstrate that measures of team-level pace
derived from spatio-temporal data are informative metrics in hockey and should
prove useful in other team sports.

real-time, reliable and secure communication services for such applications. A
key challenge in RTWN management is how to ensure real-time Quality of Services
(QoS) especially in the presence of unexpected disturbances and lossy wireless
links. Most prior work takes centralized approaches for handling disturbances,
which are slow and subject to single-point failure, and do not scale. To
overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a fully distributed packet
scheduling framework called FD-PaS. FD-PaS aims to provide guaranteed fast
response to unexpected disturbances while achieving minimum performance
degradation for meeting the timing and reliability requirements of all critical
tasks. To combat the scalability challenge, FD-PaS incorporates several key
advances in both algorithm design and data link layer protocol design to enable
individual nodes to make on-line decisions locally without any centralized
control. Our extensive simulation and testbed results have validated the
correctness of the FD-PaS design and demonstrated its effectiveness in
providing fast response for handling disturbances while ensuring the designated
QoS requirements.

for the incompressible Hall- and electron-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations
without resistivity. These PDEs are fluid descriptions of plasmas, where the
effect of collisions is neglected (no resistivity), while the motion of the
electrons relative to the ions (Hall current term) is taken into account. The
Hall current term endows the magnetic field equation with a quasilinear
dispersive character, which is key to our mechanism for illposedness. Perhaps
the most striking conclusion of this article is that the Cauchy problems for
the Hall-MHD (either viscous or inviscid) and the electron-MHD equations, under
one translational symmetry, are ill-posed near the trivial solution in any
sufficiently high regularity Sobolev space and even in Gevrey spaces. This
result holds despite obvious wellposedness of the linearized equations near the
trivial solution, as well as conservation of the nonlinear energy, by which the
$L^{2}$ norm (energy) of the solution stays constant in time. The core
illposedness mechanism is degeneration of certain high frequency wave packet
solutions to the linearization around a class of linearly degenerate stationary
solutions of these equations, which are essentially dispersive equations with
degenerate principal symbols. The method developed in this work is sharp and
robust, in that we also prove nonlinear $H^{s}$-illposedness in the presence of
fractional dissipation of any order less than 1, matching known wellposedness
results. The results in this article are complemented by a companion work,
where we provide geometric conditions on the initial magnetic field that ensure
wellposedness(!) of the Cauchy problem. In particular, in stark contrast to the
results here, it is shown in the companion work that the nonlinear Cauchy
problems are well-posed near any nonzero constant magnetic field.

in the Navier-Stokes equations is treated as an intrinsic forcing of the linear
resolvent operator, to educe the structure of fluctuations in the range of
scales (wavenumbers) where linear mechanisms are not active. In this region,
the absence of dominant linear mechanisms is reflected in the lack of low-rank
characteristics of the resolvent and in the disagreement between the structure
of resolvent modes and actual flow features. To demonstrate the procedure, we
choose low Reynolds number cylinder flow and the Couette equilibrium solution
EQ1, which are representative of very low-rank flows dominated by one linear
mechanism. The former is evolving in time, allowing us to compare resolvent
modes with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) modes at the first and second
harmonics of the shedding frequency. There is a match between the modes at the
first harmonic but not at the second harmonic where there is no separation of
the resolvent operator's singular values. We compute the self-interaction of
the resolvent mode at the shedding frequency and illustrate its similarity to
the nonlinear forcing of the second harmonic. When it is run through the
resolvent operator, the `forced' resolvent mode shows better agreement with the
DMD mode. A similar phenomenon is observed for the fundamental streamwise
wavenumber of the EQ1 solution and its second harmonic. The importance of
parasitic modes, labeled as such since they are driven by the amplified
frequencies, is their contribution to the nonlinear forcing of the main
amplification mechanisms as shown for the shedding mode, which has subtle
discrepancies with its DMD counterpart.

Furthermore, we extend BIN to composite BIN (CBIN), which involves the

Some of our conclusions are not surprising while others are more subtle. We
find that: (i) Values of the final orbital separation derived from common
envelope simulations must at this time be considered upper limits. Simulations
that include recombination energy do not seem to have systematically different
final separations; these and other simulations imply $\alpha_{\rm CE} <
0.6-1.0$. At least one simulation, {applicable to double-degenerate systems},
implies $\alpha_{\rm CE} < 0.2$. (ii) Despite large reconstruction errors, the
post-RGB observations reconstructed parameters are in agreement with some of
the simulations. The post-AGB observations behave instead as if they had a
systematically lower value of $\alpha_{\rm CE}$. The lack of common envelope
simulations with low mass AGB stars leaves us with no insight as to why this is
the case. (iii) The smallest mass companion that survives the common envelope
with intermediate mass giants is 0.05-0.1~\ms. (iv) Observations of binaries
with separations larger than $\sim$10~\rs, tend to have high $M_2/M_1$ mass
ratios and may go through a relatively long phase of unstable Roche lobe mass
transfer followed by a weakened common envelope (or with no common envelope at
all). (v) The effect of the spatial resolution and of the softening length on
simulation results remains poorly quantified.

galaxies in our Universe. We present a sample of 21 hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations of dwarf galaxies and 20 simulations of satellite-host galaxy
interaction that we performed both in a Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark
Matter (WDM) scenario. In the WDM simulations, we observe a higher critical
mass for the onset of star formation. Structure growth is delayed in WDM, as a
result WDM haloes have a stellar population on average two Gyrs younger than
their CDM counterparts. Nevertheless, despite this delayed star formation, CDM
and WDM galaxies are both able to reproduce the observed scaling relations for
velocity dispersion, stellar mass, size, and metallicity at $z=0$. WDM
satellite haloes in a Milky Way mass host are more susceptible to tidal
stripping due to their lower concentrations, but their galaxies can even
survive longer than the CDM counterparts if they live in a dark matter halo
with a steeper central slope. In agreement with our previous CDM satellite
study we observe a steepening of the WDM satellites' central dark matter
density slope due to stripping. The difference in the average stellar age for
satellite galaxies, between CDM and WDM, could be used in the future for
disentangling these two models.

from two-dimensional (2D) granular crystals containing two types of grains with
the same size, but different masses. We tune the mass contrast and arrangement
of the grains to maximize the width of the frequency band gap in the device.
The input signal is applied to a single grain on one side of the device, and
the output signal is measured from another grain on the other side of the
device. Changing the size of one or many grains tunes the pressure, which
controls the vibrational response of the device. Switching between the on and
off states is achieved using two mechanisms: 1) pressure-induced switching
where the interparticle contact network is the same in the on and off states,
and 2) switching through contact breaking. In general, the performance of the
acoustic switch, as captured by the gain ratio and switching time between the
on and off states, is better for pressure-induced switching. We show that in
these acoustic switches the gain ratio between the on and off states can be
larger than $10^4$ and the switching time (multiplied by the driving frequency)
is comparable to that obtained recently for sonic crystals and less than that
for photonic transistor-like switches. Since the self-assembly of grains with
different masses into 2D granular crystals is challenging, we describe
simulations of circular grains with small circular knobs placed symmetrically
around the perimeter mixed with circular grains without knobs. Using umbrella
sampling techniques, we show that devices with grains with $3$ knobs most
efficiently form the hexagonal crystals that yield the largest band gap.

advantages of deep neural networks with sigmoid-type activations (called deep
sigmoid nets) over their rectified linear unit (ReLU) counterparts (called deep
ReLU nets) in terms of approximation. In particular, we prove that the
approximation capability of deep sigmoid nets is not worse than that of deep

deep sigmoid nets with two hidden layers and finitely many free parameters but
not vice-verse. We also establish the global convergence of the proposed ADMM

from arbitrary initial points to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point at a rate of
order ${\cal O}(1/k)$. Besides sigmoid activation, such a convergence theorem
holds for a general class of smooth activations. Compared with the widely used

the Dirac cones open a gap, and that the Chern number for the lowest band has a

  Adversarial Examples",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper demonstrates that Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is commonly
used in Object Detection (OD) tasks to filter redundant detection results, is
no longer secure. Considering that NMS has been an integral part of OD systems,
thwarting the functionality of NMS can result in unexpected or even lethal
consequences for such systems. In this paper, an adversarial example attack
which triggers malfunctioning of NMS in end-to-end OD models is proposed. The
attack, namely \texttt{Daedalus}, compresses the dimensions of detection boxes
to evade NMS. As a result, the final detection output contains extremely dense
false positives. This can be fatal for many OD applications such as autonomous
vehicles and surveillance systems. The attack can be generalised to different
end-to-end OD models, such that the attack cripples various OD applications.
Furthermore, a way to craft robust adversarial examples is developed by using
an ensemble of popular detection models as the substitutes. Considering the
pervasive nature of model reusing in real-world OD scenarios, Daedalus examples
crafted based on an \textit{ensemble of substitutes} can launch attacks without
knowing the parameters of the victim models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the attack effectively stops NMS from filtering redundant bounding boxes.
As the evaluation results suggest, Daedalus increases the false positive rate
in detection results to $99.9\%$ and reduces the mean average precision scores
to $0$, while maintaining a low cost of distortion on the original inputs. It
is also demonstrated that the attack can be practically launched against
real-world OD systems via printed posters.

formation. However, their characteristics are heavily debated, and the exact
processes that lead to their formation and fragmentation into dense cores still
remain to be fully understood. We aim at characterising the mass, kinematics,
and stability against gravitational collapse of a statistically significant
sample of filaments in the Orion B molecular cloud, which is renown for its
very low star formation efficiency. We characterise the gas column densities
and kinematics over a field of 1.9 deg$^2$, using C$^{18}$O(J=1-0) data from
the IRAM-30m large programme ORION-B. Using two different Hessian-based
filters, we extract and compare two filamentary networks, each containing over
100 filaments. Independent of the extraction method, the filaments have widths
of 0.12$\pm$0.04 pc, and show a wide range of linear (1 - 100
$M_{\odot}$pc$^{-1}$) and volume densities (2.10$^3$ - 2.10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$).
Compared to previous studies, the filament population is dominated by
low-density, thermally sub-critical structures, suggesting that most of the
identified filaments are not collapsing to form stars. In fact, only ~1% of the
Orion B cloud mass covered by our observations can be found in super-critical,
star-forming filaments, explaining the low star formation efficiency of the
region. The velocity profiles observed across the filaments show quiescence in
the centre, and coherency in the plane of the sky, despite being mostly
supersonic. The filaments in Orion B apparently belong to a continuum which
contains a few elements comparable to already studied star-forming filaments as
well as many lower-density, gravitationally unbound structures. This
comprehensive study of the Orion B filaments shows that the mass fraction in
super-critical filaments is a key factor in determining star formation
efficiency.

retrieval and natural language processing tasks due to their ability to capture
lexical semantics. However, while many such tasks involve or even rely on named
entities as central components, popular word embedding models have so far
failed to include entities as first-class citizens. While it seems intuitive
that annotating named entities in the training corpus should result in more
intelligent word features for downstream tasks, performance issues arise when
popular embedding approaches are naively applied to entity annotated corpora.
Not only are the resulting entity embeddings less useful than expected, but one
also finds that the performance of the non-entity word embeddings degrades in
comparison to those trained on the raw, unannotated corpus. In this paper, we
investigate approaches to jointly train word and entity embeddings on a large
corpus with automatically annotated and linked entities. We discuss two
distinct approaches to the generation of such embeddings, namely the training
of state-of-the-art embeddings on raw-text and annotated versions of the
corpus, as well as node embeddings of a co-occurrence graph representation of
the annotated corpus. We compare the performance of annotated embeddings and
classical word embeddings on a variety of word similarity, analogy, and
clustering evaluation tasks, and investigate their performance in
entity-specific tasks. Our findings show that it takes more than training
popular word embedding models on an annotated corpus to create entity
embeddings with acceptable performance on common test cases. Based on these
results, we discuss how and when node embeddings of the co-occurrence graph
representation of the text can restore the performance.

surfaces of small bodies contain unpredictable and interesting features such as
craters, dust, and granular matter, which need to be observed carefully before
a lander mission is even considered. This presents the need for a surveillance
spacecraft to observe the surface of small bodies where these features exist.
While traditionally, the small body exploration has been performed by a large
monolithic spacecraft, a group of small, low-cost spacecraft can enhance the
observational value of the mission. Such a spacecraft swarm has the advantage
of providing longer observation time and is also tolerant to single point
failures. In order to optimize a space-craft swarm mission design, we proposed
the Integrated Design Engineering & Automation of Swarms (IDEAS) software which
will serve as an end-to-end tool for theoretical swarm mission design. The
current work will focus on developing the Automated Swarm Designer module of
the IDEAS software by extending its capabilities for exploring surface features
on small bodies while focusing on the attitude behaviors of the spacecraft in
the swarm. We begin by classifying space-craft swarms into 5 classes based on
the level of coordination. In the current work, we design Class 2 swarms, whose
spacecraft operate in a decentralized fashion but coordinate for communication.
We demonstrate the Class 2 swarm in 2 different configurations, based on the

Fiedorowicz and Sidorowicz as another variation of the domination game. The
rules are essentially the same, except that the set of played vertices must be
connected at all stages of the game. We answer a problem from their paper
regarding the relation between the number of moves in a game where
Dominator/Staller starts the game. In this paper we also study the relation to
the diameter and present graphs with small connected game domination number. We
determine the values on the lexicographic product graphs, and consider the
effect of predomination of a vertex on the connected game domination number.

acquiring these results in the first place necessitates what the same theory
considers to be an interaction? In this note, we assume that theories account
for interactions so that they are empirically traceable, and that observations
necessarily go with such an interaction with the observed system. We
investigate consequences of this assumption: The unfolding language game,
inspired by ""quantum logic,"" leads to a class of contextual and probabilistic
theories. Contextuality becomes a means to render interactions, thus also
measurements, empirically tangible. The measurement ""problem"" arises in all
such theories, not only quantum mechanics: It is a consequence of the need for
empirical evidence of interactions. And a consequence of the converse need for
an interaction when obtaining that empirical evidence.

parametrized by weight $\theta$ and phase $\phi$ parameters, in the presence of
the Unruh effect experienced by a mode of a free Dirac field. We investigate
the effects of the partial measurement (PM) and partial measurement reversal
(PMR) on the quantum resources (QRs) and quantum Fisher information (QFI) of
the teleported states. In particular, we discuss the optimal behavior of the
QFI, quantum coherence (QC) as well as fidelity with respect to the PM and PMR
strength and examine the effect of the Unruh noise on optimal estimation. It is
found that in the single-qubit scenario, the PM (PMR) strength at which the
optimal estimation of the phase parameter occurs, is the same as the PM (PMR)
strength with which the teleportation fidelity and the QC of the teleported
single-qubit state reaches to its maximum value. On the other hand,
generalizing the results to two-qubit teleportation, we find that the encoded
information in the weight parameter is better protected against the Unruh noise
in two-qubit teleportation than the one-qubit scenario. However, extraction of
information encoded in the phase parameter is more efficient in single-qubit
teleportation than the two-qubit one.

  Power Allocation in Nonorthogonal Multiple Access","30 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a massive number of devices, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has
been recognized as a promising technology for improving the spectral efficiency
compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA). However, it is difficult for a
base station (BS) to provide all of the information about NOMA signals via a
high layer owing to signaling overhead concerns. This paper studies blind
signal classification, which determines whether or not the received NOMA signal
requires successive interference cancellation (SIC) without a priori signal
information. In this paper, two types of blind signal classification errors are
analyzed: 1) the signal is classified as one that does not require SIC on the
SIC user side and 2) the signal is classified as one for which SIC is necessary
on the non-SIC user side. In addition, we formulate the joint optimization
problem for user scheduling and power allocation, which maximizes the sum-rate
gain of NOMA over OMA with constraints on the maximum classification error
probability and minimum data rate. The proposed algorithm iteratively finds
solutions for user scheduling and power allocation. Simulation results show
that the proposed scheme outperforms existing user scheduling methods.

notoriously limited by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension
with system size. A common and well-known practice to reduce this increasing
computational effort is to take advantage of the translational symmetry $C_N$
in periodic systems. This represents a rather simple yet elegant application of
the group theoretical symmetry projection operator technique. For isotropic
exchange interactions, the spin-rotational symmetry SU(2) can be used, where
the Hamiltonian matrix is block-structured according to the total spin- and
magnetization quantum numbers. Rewriting the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in terms of
irreducible tensor operators allows for an efficient and highly parallelizable
implementation to calculate its matrix elements recursively in the
spin-coupling basis. When combining both $C_N$ and SU(2), mathematically, the
symmetry projection technique leads to ready-to-use formulas. However, the
evaluation of these formulas is very demanding in both computation time and
memory consumption, problems which are said to outweigh the benefits of the
symmetry reduced matrix shape. We show a way to minimize the computational
effort for selected systems and present the largest numerically accessible
cases.

concerns the $g$-dimensional Hausdorff measure ($\HH^g$-measure) of the set of
$\Psi$-approximable points on nondegenerate manifolds. The problem relates the
`size' of the set of $\Psi$-approximable points with the convergence or
divergence of a certain series. In the dual approximation setting, the
divergence case has been established by Beresnevich-Dickinson-Velani (2006) for
any nondegenerate manifold. The convergence case, however, represents a major
challenging open problem and progress thus far has been effectuated in limited
cases only. In this paper, we discuss and prove several results on the
$\HH^g$-measure on Veronese curves in any dimension $n$. As a consequence of
one of our results, we generalize recent results of Pezzoni [Acta Arith. 193
(2020), no. 3, 269-281] regarding $n=3$. This improvement evolves from a deeper
investigation on general irreducibility considerations applicable in arbitrary
dimensions. We further investigate the $\HH^g$-measure for convergence on
planar curves. We show that the monotonicity assumption on a multivariable
approximating function cannot be removed for planar curves.

significant increase in the threat of satellite collisions. Spacecraft must
undertake collision avoidance maneuvers to mitigate the risk. According to

operators on the Earth. The manual maneuver planning requires qualified
personnel and will be impractical for constellations of thousands satellites.
In this paper we propose a new modular autonomous collision avoidance system

Significant correlations (p<0.001) were found in all regions (between 0.94 and
0.97) for calibrated bone density between radiographs with minimal and clinical
post-processing. Correlations varied between 0.51 and 0.97 (p<0.001) for FD_Ver

latent variable models have received renewed attention as powerful generative
models. However, their performance in terms of test likelihood and quality of
generated samples has been surpassed by autoregressive models without
stochastic units. Furthermore, flow-based models have recently been shown to be
an attractive alternative that scales well to high-dimensional data. In this
paper we close the performance gap by constructing VAE models that can
effectively utilize a deep hierarchy of stochastic variables and model complex
covariance structures. We introduce the Bidirectional-Inference Variational
Autoencoder (BIVA), characterized by a skip-connected generative model and an
inference network formed by a bidirectional stochastic inference path. We show
that BIVA reaches state-of-the-art test likelihoods, generates sharp and
coherent natural images, and uses the hierarchy of latent variables to capture
different aspects of the data distribution. We observe that BIVA, in contrast
to recent results, can be used for anomaly detection. We attribute this to the
hierarchy of latent variables which is able to extract high-level semantic
features. Finally, we extend BIVA to semi-supervised classification tasks and
show that it performs comparably to state-of-the-art results by generative
adversarial networks.

effect on the permanent night sides of 1 to 1 tidally locked terrestrial
exoplanets with Earth-like atmospheres and oceans in the middle of the
habitable zone. However, the impact of ocean dynamics on the habitable zone's
boundaries (inner edge and outer edge) is still unknown and represents a major
gap in our understanding of this type of planets. Here we use a coupled
atmosphere-ocean global climate model to show that planetary heat transport
from the day to night side is dominated by the ocean at lower stellar fluxes
and by the atmosphere near the inner edge of the habitable zone. This decrease
in oceanic heat transport (OHT) at high stellar fluxes is mainly due to
weakening of surface wind stress and a decrease in surface shortwave energy
deposition. We further show that ocean dynamics have almost no effect on the
observational thermal phase curves of planets near the inner edge of the
habitable zone. For planets in the habitable zone's middle range, ocean
dynamics moves the hottest spot on the surface eastward from the substellar
point. These results suggest that future studies of the inner edge may devote
computational resources to atmosphere-only processes such as clouds and
radiation. For studies of the middle range and outer edge of the habitable
zone, however, fully coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling will be necessary. Note
that due to computational resource limitations, only one rotation period (60
Earth days) has been systematically examined in this study; future work varying
rotation period as well as other parameters such as atmospheric mass and

fault is equivalent to factoring the mechanical moment at the fault as done in
structural engineering with the applied loads, by the most currently used
structural engineering standards (e.g. Eurocodes). A special safety factor is
introduced and related to the partial factor acting on the mechanical moment
representing the fault. A comparison is then made between the hazard maps
obtained for Italy with the Neo Deterministic Seismic Hazard Assessment (NDSHA)
technique, using two approaches for the definition of the seismic sources
considered for the computation of the synthetic seismograms. The first one is
based on the magnitude of the events listed in the earthquake catalogue, and
located within the active seismogenic zones. This is the standard approach,
used in most of the NDSHA computations performed up to now. It is adequate for
countries, like Italy, where the catalogue can be reasonably considered
complete for events of M=5 and above. When the catalogue completeness is barely
adequate, another approach can be adopted for the definition of the earthquake
sources. It uses the seismogenic nodes identified by means of pattern
recognition techniques applied to morphostructural seismic zonation (MSZ), and
increases the reference magnitude by a constant variation tuned thanks to the
safety factor. The two approaches have been compared for Italy using the safety
factor 2.0: they mostly produce comparable hazard maps. As the two sets are
fully independent and the catalogue is very long, this implies a validation of
the seismogenic nodes method and a tuning of the safety factor at about 2.
Notable exception is seen in the Central Alps, where nodes tend to overestimate
the ""observed"" hazard, and in southeastern Sicily, where the nodes
underestimation is only apparent and can be negligible within experimental
errors.

oblate nematic LCs incorporating particles with the same infinite-dilution
translational or rotational diffusion coefficients. Under these conditions,
which are benchmarked against the standard case of identical aspect ratios, we
observe that prolate particles display faster dynamics than oblate particles at
short and long timescales. Nevertheless, when compared at identical
infinite-dilution translational diffusion coefficients, oblate particles are
faster than their prolate counterparts at short-to-intermediate timescales,
which extend over almost three time decades. Both oblate and prolate particles
exhibit an anisotropic diffusion with respect to the orientation of the nematic
director. More specifically, prolate particles show a fast diffusion in the
direction parallel to the nematic director, while their diffusion in the
direction perpendicular to it is slower. By contrast, the diffusion of oblate
particles is faster in the plane perpendicular to the nematic director.
Finally, in the light of our recent study on the long-time Gaussian and Fickian
diffusion in nematic LCs, we map the decay of the autocorrelation functions and
their fluctuations over the timescales of our simulations to ponder the
existence of mobile clusters of particles and the occurrence of collective

topological order, the holographic AdS/CFT duality, and tensor networks, we
initiate the study of approximate quantum error-detecting codes in matrix
product states (MPS). We first show that using open-boundary MPS to define
boundary to bulk encoding maps yields at most constant distance error-detecting
codes. These are degenerate ground spaces of gapped local Hamiltonians. To get
around this no-go result, we consider excited states, i.e., we use the
excitation ansatz to construct encoding maps: these yield error-detecting codes
with distance $\Omega(n^{1-\nu})$ for any $\nu\in (0,1)$ and $\Omega(\log n)$
encoded qubits. This shows that gapped systems contain $-$ within isolated
energy bands $-$ error-detecting codes spanned by momentum eigenstates. We also
consider the gapless Heisenberg-XXX model, whose energy eigenstates can be
described via Bethe ansatz tensor networks. We show that it contains $-$ within
its low-energy eigenspace $-$ an error-detecting code with the same parameter
scaling. All these codes detect arbitrary $d$-local (not necessarily
geometrically local) errors even though they are not permutation-invariant.
This suggests that a wide range of naturally occurring many-body systems
possess intrinsic error-detecting features.

the crustal lattice and only electrons are mobile, and magnetic-field evolution
is thus directly related to the electron velocity. The evolution, however,
builds magnetic stresses that can become sufficiently large for the crust to
exceed its elastic limit, and to flow plastically. We consider the nature of
this plastic flow and the back-reaction on the crustal magnetic field
evolution. We formulate a plane-parallel model for the local failure, showing
that surface motions are inevitable once the crust yields, in the absence of
extra dissipative mechanisms. We perform numerical evolutions of the crustal
magnetic field under the joint effect of Hall drift and Ohmic decay, tracking
the build-up of magnetic stresses, and diagnosing crustal failure with the von
Mises criterion. Beyond this point we solve for the coupled evolution of the
plastic velocity and magnetic field. Our results suggest that to have a
coexistence of a magnetar corona with small-scale magnetic features, the
viscosity of the plastic flow must be roughly $10^{36}-10^{37}\ \textrm{g

produced by different nucleosynthesis processes behave with stellar age and
provide empirical relations to derive stellar ages from chemical abundances. We
derive different sets of ages using Gaia parallaxes for a sample of more than
1000 FGK dwarf stars for which he have spectra from the HARPS-GTO program. We
analyze the temporal evolution of different abundance ratios to find the best
chemical clocks. We find that [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio (average of Mg, Si and Ti),
[O/Fe] and [Zn/Fe] are good age proxies with a lower dispersion than the
age-metallicity dispersion. Several abundance ratios present a significant
correlation with age for chemically separated thin disk stars (i.e.
low-$\alpha$) but in the case of the chemically defined thick disk stars (i.e.
high-$\alpha$) only the elements Mg, Si, Ca and TiII show a clear correlation
with age. We find that the thick disk stars are more enriched in light-s
elements than thin disk stars of similar age. The maximum enrichment of
s-process elements in the thin disk occurs in the youngest stars which in turn
have solar metallicity. The slopes of the [X/Fe]-age relations are quite
constant for O, Mg, Si, Ti, Zn, Sr and Eu regardless of the metallicity.
However, this is not the case for Al, Ca, Cu and most of the s-process
elements, which display very different trends depending on the metallicity.
This demonstrates the limitations of using simple linear relations based on
certain abundance ratios to obtain ages for stars of different metallicities.
Finally, we show that by using 3D relations with a chemical clock and two
stellar parameters (either Teff, [Fe/H] or stellar mass) we can explain up to
89% of age variance in a star. A similar result is obtained when using 2D
relations with a chemical clock and one stellar parameter, being up to a 87% of
the variance explained.

simplectic structure, and the so-called Generalized Uncertainty Principle. We
show how the difference in the sign of the fundamental Poisson bracket is
reflected in a sign of the modified source term in the Friedmann equation,
responsible for the removal of the initial singularity in the polymer case and
for the survival of a singular point in the Universe past, when the Generalized
Uncertainty Principle is concerned.
  Then, we study the regularization of the vacuum energy of a free massless
scalar field, by implementing a second quantization formalism in the context of
Polymer Quantum Mechanics. We show that, from this reformulation, naturally
emerges a Cosmological Constant term for the isotropic Universe, whose value
depends directly on the polymer parameter of the regularization.
  Finally, we investigate the behaviour of gravitational waves on the
background of a modified dynamics, according to the semiclassical Friedmann
equation. We demonstrate that the presence of a Bounce in the Universe past,
naturally removes the divergence of the gravitational wave amplitude and they
can, in principle, propagate across the minimum volume turning point. This
result offers the intriguing perspective for the detection of gravitational
signals coming from the pre-Big Bounce collapsing Universe.

invariable. To represent free energy of the subsystem of mobile charges in the

the screening effects, the results of the collective variables method are used.
A system of integral equations for the potentials of mean forces is obtained

calculations are made in the lattice approximation. The correlation component
distinguished in the expression for the binary distribution function makes it
possible to calculate the correlated and uncorrelated parts of the electric
potential using the Poisson equation. In the case of sufficiently small
electric fields, a linear expansion of the chemical potential in terms of
deviation of the charge concentration from the homogeneous distribution is
considered. In final calculations the correlation between particles is taken

the potential and charge concentration distribution is described by a linear
differential equation of the fourth order. The results of its analytical
solution and subsequent numerical calculations for the characteristics of solid

set of claimed tokens and on the number of customers in the system. Our first
main result shows that, provided the assignment rule and the service rates

We show that our model subsumes known families of models that have product-form

magnetite bulk and low-index (001) surface with newly proposed parameters for

studying the vibrational properties of bulk and low-dimensional materials.
Raman spectra can be simulated using first-principles methods, but due to the
high computational cost calculations are usually limited only to fairly small
unit cells, which makes it difficult to carry out simulations for alloys and
defects. Here, we develop an efficient method for simulating Raman spectra of
alloys, benchmark it against full density-functional theory calculations, and
apply it to several alloys of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.
In this method, the Raman tensor for the supercell mode is constructed by
summing up the Raman tensors of the pristine system weighted by the projections
of the supercell vibrational modes to those of the pristine system. This
approach is not limited to 2D materials and should be applicable to any
crystalline solids with defects and impurities. To efficiently evaluate
vibrational modes of very large supercells, we adopt mass approximation,
although it is limited to chemically and structurally similar atomic
substitutions. To benchmark our method, we first apply it to
Mo$_x$W$_{(1-x)}$S$_2$ monolayer in the H-phase, where several experimental
reports are available for comparison. Second, we consider
Mo$_x$W$_{(1-x)}$Te$_2$ in the T'-phase, which has been proposed to be 2D
topological insulator, but where experimental results for the monolayer alloy
are still missing. We show that the projection scheme also provides a powerful
tool for analyzing the origin of the alloy Raman-active modes in terms of the

super-resolution method using progressive generative adversarial networks

used for more accurate detection of landmarks and pathology. Our primary
contribution is in proposing a multistage model where the output image quality
of one stage is progressively improved in the next stage by using a triplet
loss function. The triplet loss enables stepwise image quality improvement by
using the output of the previous stage as the baseline. This facilitates
generation of super resolved images of high scaling factor while maintaining
good image quality. Experimental results for image super-resolution show that
our proposed multistage P-GAN outperforms competing methods and baseline GAN.

lines. An analysis of the spectral energy distribution has also been performed.
Emissions from 12 molecular species (not counting isotopologues) have been

0.6"". Four circumstellar components are identified: i) a central compact source
of size 0.15"", ii) an expanding equatorial density enhancement (a flattened
density distribution in the plane of the orbit) of size 3"", iii) a bipolar
high-velocity outflow (150 km/s), and iv) an hourglass structure. The outflow
is directed almost along the line of sight. There is evidence of a second
bipolar outflow. The mass of the circumstellar gas is 0.5[D/1 kpc]^2 Msun,
about half of it lies in the equatorial density enhancement. The dust mass is
0.01[D/1 kpc]^2 Msun, and a substantial fraction of this is in the form of
large-sized, up to 1 mm, grains. The estimated kinetic age of the outflow is
770[D/1 kpc] yr. The kinetic energy and the scalar momentum of the accelerated
gas are estimated to be 7x10^(45)[D/1 kpc]^2 erg and 10^(39)[D/1 kpc]^2 g cm/s,
respectively. We provide good evidence that the binary system HD101584 is in a
post-common-envelope-evolution phase, that ended before a stellar merger.
Isotope ratios combined with stellar mass estimates suggest that the primary
star's evolution was terminated already on the first red giant branch (RGB).
Most of the energy required to drive the outflowing gas was probably released
when material fell towards the companion.

the discrete genealogies of Cannings models with fixed population size, when
time is rescaled and population size $N\to\infty$. As established for Kingman's
$n$-coalescent, moderate population size fluctuations in the discrete
population model should be reflected by a time-change of the limit coalescent.
For $\Lambda$-$n$-coalescents, this has been explicitly shown for only a
limited subclass of $\Lambda$-$n$-coalescents and exponentially growing
populations. This article gives a general construction of time-changed
$\Lambda$-$n$-coalescents as limits of specific Cannings models with rather
arbitrary time changes.

of executing one or more programs, simultaneously, by multiple processors. In
general, we have two ways to perform a parallel calculation. The first is to
cut the program into several calculation tasks then, run all these parallel

that each part of the data is assigned to a different processor. Then, all the

when the problem scales up. The reinforcement learning algorithms can also
adaptively reduce the complexity of the control sequences, shortening the

devices), operate as nonlinear magnetic metamaterials in microwaves. Such {\em
SQUID metamaterials} are paradigmatic systems that serve as a test-bed for
simulating several nonlinear dynamics phenomena. SQUIDs are highly nonlinear
oscillators which are coupled together through magnetic dipole-dipole forces
due to their mutual inductance; that coupling falls-off approximately as the
inverse cube of their distance, i.~e., it is non-local. However, it can be
approximated by a local (nearest-neighbor) coupling which in many cases
suffices for capturing the essentials of the dynamics of SQUID metamaterials.
For either type of coupling, it is numerically demonstrated that chimera states
as well as other spatially non-uniform states can be generated in SQUID
metamaterials under time-dependent applied magnetic flux for appropriately
chosen initial conditions. The mechanism for the emergence of these states is
discussed in terms of the multistability property of the individual SQUIDs
around their resonance frequency and the attractor crowding effect in systems
of coupled nonlinear oscillators. Interestingly, generation and control of
chimera states in SQUID metamaterials can be achieved in the presence of a
constant (dc) flux gradient with the SQUID metamaterial initially at rest.

through a graph while a player chooses which vertices to protect in order to
contain it. In this paper, we focus on the case of trees and we consider as
well the Fractional Firefighter game where the amount of protection allocated
to a vertex lies between 0 and 1. While most of the work in this area deals
with a constant amount of firefighters available at each turn, we consider
three research questions which arise when including the sequence of
firefighters as part of the instance. We first introduce the online version of
both Firefighter and Fractional Firefighter, in which the number of
firefighters available at each turn is revealed over time. We show that a
greedy algorithm on finite trees is 1/2-competitive for both online versions,
which generalises a result previously known for special cases of Firefighter.
We also show that the optimal competitive ratio of online Firefighter ranges
between 1/2 and the inverse of the golden ratio. Next, given two firefighter
sequences, we discuss sufficient conditions for the existence of an infinite
tree that separates them, in the sense that the fire can be contained with one
sequence but not with the other. To this aim, we study a new purely numerical
game called targeting game. Finally, we give sufficient conditions for the fire
to be contained, expressed as the asymptotic comparison of the number of
firefighters and the size of the tree levels.

chromospheric emission from Sun-like stars with the variability seen in their
eigenmode frequencies, it is possible to relate the changes observed at the
surfaces of these stars to the changes taking place in the interior. By further
comparing this variability to changes in the relative flux from the stars, one
can obtain an expression for how these activity indicators relate to the energy
output from the stars. Such studies become very pertinent when the variability
can be related to stellar cycles as they can then be used to improve our
understanding of the solar cycle and its effect on the energy output from the
Sun.
  Here we present observations of chromospheric emission in 20 Sun-like stars
obtained over the course of the nominal 4-year Kepler mission. Even though 4
years is too short to detect stellar equivalents of the 11-year solar cycle,
observations from the Kepler mission can still be used to analyse the
variability of the different activity indicators thereby obtaining information
of the physical mechanism generating the variability. The analysis reveals no
strong correlation between the different activity indicators, except in very
few cases. We suggest that this is due to the sparse sampling of our
ground-based observations on the one hand and that we are likely not tracing
cyclic variability on the other hand. We also discuss how to improve the

Blockchain is an append-only data structure. Thus, to operate Full Nodes, the
required storage capacity would grow too large for resource-constrained
devices. Due to the limitation, the existing lightweight node scheme is that a
node relies on other Full Nodes. In this thesis, to reduce storage capacity
with keeping the independence of each node, we propose a storage load balancing
scheme ""KARAKASA"" using Distributed Hash Table (DHT). In KARAKASA, nodes
distributedly keep the whole blockchain among DHT networked nodes. We evaluated
KARAKASA from the view of storage capacity and independence. As a result, a
node in a cluster does not need to trust other nodes. We concluded that nodes
in a DHT cluster can behave like Full Nodes without holding the whole

Hubble Space Telescope photometry to investigate MPs in NGC 2419, which is one
of the most-massive and distant GCs of the Galaxy, almost isolated from its
tidal influence. We find that the 1G hosts the ~37% of the analyzed stars, and
identified three populations of 2G stars, namely 2GA, 2GB, and 2GC, which
comprise the ~20%, ~31% and ~12% of stars, respectively. We compare the
observed colors of these four populations with the colors derived from
appropriate synthetic spectra to infer the relative helium abundances. We find
that 2GA, 2GB, and 2GC stars are enhanced in helium mass fraction by deltaY
~0.01, 0.06, and 0.19 with respectto 1G stars that have primordial helium
(Y=0.246). The high He enrichment of 2GC stars is hardly reconcilable with most
of the current scenarios for MPs. Furthermore, the relatively larger fraction
of 1G stars (~37%) compared to other massive GCs is noticeable. By exploiting
literature results, we find that the fractions of 1G stars of GCs with large
perigalactic distance are typically higher than in the other GCs with similar

from the far-ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths. It also follows the
chemical evolution of their stars, gas and dust.
  For a given scenario (a set of parameters defining the history of mass
assembly, the star formation law, the initial mass function...), P\'egase.3
consistently computes the following:
  * the star formation, infall, outflow and supernova rates from 0 to 20 Gyr;
  * the stellar metallicity, the abundances of main elements in the gas and the
composition of dust;
  * the unattenuated stellar spectral energy distribution (SED);
  * the nebular SED, using nebular continua and emission lines precomputed with
code Cloudy (Ferland et al. 2017);
  * the attenuation in star-forming clouds and the diffuse interstellar medium,
by absorption and scattering on dust grains, of the stellar and nebular SEDs.
For this, the code uses grids of the transmittance for spiral and spheroidal
galaxies. We precomputed these grids through Monte Carlo simulations of
radiative transfer based on the method of virtual interactions;
  * the re-emission by grains of the light they absorbed, taking into account
stochastic heating.
  The main innovation compared to P\'egase.2 is the modeling of dust emission
and its evolution. The computation of nebular emission has also been entirely
upgraded to take into account metallicity effects and infrared lines.
  Other major differences are that complex scenarios of evolution (derived for
instance from cosmological simulations), with several episodes of star
formation, infall or outflow, may now be implemented, and that the detailed
evolution of the most important elements -- not only the overall metallicity --
is followed.

nanophotonic waveguides are a powerful platform for fundamental research in
quantum optics as well as for applications in quantum communication and quantum
information processing. Ever since the first realization of such a hybrid
quantum nanophotonic, heating rates of the atomic motion observed in various
experimental settings have typically been exceeding those in comparable
free-space optical microtraps by about three orders of magnitude. This
excessive heating is a roadblock for the implementation of certain protocols
and devices. Its origin has so far remained elusive and, at the typical
atom-surface separations of less than an optical wavelength encountered in
nanophotonic traps, numerous effects may potentially contribute to atom
heating. Here, we theoretically describe the effect of mechanical vibrations of
waveguides on guided light fields and provide a general theory of
particle-phonon interaction in nanophotonic traps. We test our theory by
applying it to the case of laser-cooled cesium atoms in nanofiber-based
two-color optical traps. We find excellent quantitative agreement between the
predicted heating rates and experimentally measured values. Our theory predicts
that, in this setting, the dominant heating process stems from the
optomechanical coupling of the optically trapped atoms to the continuum of
thermally occupied flexural mechanical modes of the waveguide structure. Beyond
unraveling the long-standing riddle of excessive heating in nanofiber-based
atom traps, we also study the dependence of the heating rates on the relevant
system parameters. Our findings allow us to propose several strategies for
minimizing the heating. Finally, our findings are also highly relevant for
optomechanics experiments with dielectric nanoparticles that are optically

\mathbb{Q}_{\geq 0}\cup\{+\infty\}$, in the minimum cost homomorphism problem,
MinHOM(H), goal is finding a homomorphism $f:V(G)\to V(H)$ (a.k.a H-coloring)
that minimizes $\sum\limits_{v\in V(G)}c(v,f(v))$. The complexity of exact
minimization of this problem is well understood [34], and the class of digraphs
H, for which the MinHOM(H) is polynomial time solvable is a small subset of all
digraphs.
  In this paper, we consider the approximation of MinHOM within a constant
factor. For digraphs, MinHOM(H) is not approximable if H contains a digraph
asteroidal triple (DAT). We take a major step toward a dichotomy classification
of approximable cases. We give a dichotomy classification for approximating the
MinHOM(H) when H is a graph. For digraphs, we provide constant factor
approximation algorithms for two important classes of digraphs, namely bi-arc
digraphs (digraphs with a conservative semi-lattice polymorphism or
min-ordering), and k-arc digraphs (digraphs with an extended min-ordering).
Specifically, we show that:
  1. Dichotomy for Graphs: MinHOM(H) has a $2|V(H)|$-approximation algorithm if
graph H admits a conservative majority polymorphims (i.e. H is a bi-arc graph),
otherwise, it is inapproximable;
  2. MinHOM(H) has a $|V(H)|^2$-approximation algorithm if H is a bi-arc
digraph;
  3. MinHOM(H) has a $|V(H)|^2$-approximation algorithm if H is a k-arc
digraph.
  In conclusion, we show the importance of these results and provide insights
for achieving a dichotomy classification of approximable cases. Our constant
factors depend on the size of H. However, the implementation of our algorithms
provides a much better approximation ratio. It leaves open to investigate a
classification of digraphs H, where MinHOM(H) admits a constant factor
approximation algorithm that is independent of H.

two-dimensional (2D) reformations, rather than three-dimensional (3D) data to
locate and identify vertebrae.
  Methods: We improved the Btrfly Net (described by Sekuboyina et al) that
works on sagittal and coronal maximum intensity projections (MIP) and augmented
it with two additional components: spine-localization and adversarial a
priori-learning. Furthermore, we explored two variants of adversarial training
schemes that incorporated the anatomical a priori knowledge into the Btrfly
Net. We investigated the superiority of the proposed approach for labelling
vertebrae on three datasets: a public benchmarking dataset of 302 CT scans and
two in-house datasets with a total of 238 CT scans. We employed Wilcoxon
signed-rank test to compute the statistical significance of the improvement in
performance observed due to various architectural components in our approach.
  Results: On the public dataset, our approach using the described
Btrfly(pe-eb) network performed on par with current state-of-the-art methods
achieving a statistically significant (p < .001) vertebrae identification rate
of 88.5+/-0.2 % and localization distances of less than 7-mm. On the in-house
datasets that had a higher inter-scan data variability, we obtained an
identification rate of 85.1+/-1.2%.
  Conclusion: An identification performance comparable to existing 3D
approaches was achieved when labelling vertebrae on 2D MIPs. The performance
was further improved using the proposed adversarial training regime that
effectively enforced local spine a priori knowledge during training. Lastly,
spine-localization increased the generalizability of our approach by
homogenizing the content in the MIPs.

Despite its outstanding performance, the applicability of kernel null-space
method is limited due to its susceptibility to possible training data
corruptions and inability to rank training observations according to their
conformity with the model. This work addresses these shortcomings by studying
the effect of regularising the solution of the null-space kernel Fisher
methodology in the context of its regression-based formulation (OC-KSR). In
this respect, first, the effect of a Tikhonov regularisation in the Hilbert
space is analysed where the one-class learning problem in presence of
contaminations in the training set is posed as a sensitivity analysis problem.
Next, driven by the success of the sparse representation methodology, the
effect of a sparsity regularisation on the solution is studied. For both
alternative regularisation schemes, iterative algorithms are proposed which
recursively update label confidences and rank training observations based on
their fit with the model. Through extensive experiments conducted on different
data sets, the proposed methodology is found to enhance robustness against
contamination in the training set as compared with the baseline kernel
null-space technique as well as other existing approaches in a one-class

spatio-temporal evolution of a maze pattern over long times in a large Al-Al2Cu
eutectic grain with known crystal orientation of the Al and Al2Cu phases, hence
known crystal orientation relationship (OR). The corresponding phase boundary
energy anisotropy ($\gamma$-plot) was also known, as being previously estimated
from molecular-dynamics computations. The experimental observations reveal the
time-scale of the maze-to-lamellar transition and shed light on the processes
involved in the gradual alignment of the phase boundaries to one distinct
energy minimum which nearly corresponds to one distinct plane from the family
$\{120\}^{\rm{Al}} //\{110\}^{\rm{Al2Cu}}$. This particular plane is selected
due to a crystallographic bias induced by a small disorientation of the
crystals relative to the perfect OR. The symmetry of the OR is thus slightly
broken, which promotes lamellar alignment. Finally, the maze-to-lamellar
transition leaves behind a network of fault lines inherited from the phase
boundary alignment process. In the maze pattern, the fault lines align along
the corners of the Wulff shape, thus allowing us to propose a link between the
pattern defects and missing orientations in the Wulff shape

Methods. The study of HESS J1825-137 was carried out on the basis of new radio
observations centred at the position of PSR J1826-1334 performed with the Karl
G. Jansky Very Large Array at 1.4 GHz in configurations B and C. To investigate
the nature of HESS J1826-130, we reprocessed unpublished archival data obtained
with XMM-Newton.\\ Results. The new radio continuum image towards PSR
J1826-1334 reveals a bright radio source, with the pulsar located in its
centre, which suggests that this feature could be the radio counterpart of the
compact component of the PWN detected at high energy. The new 1.4 GHz radio
data do not reveal emission with an extension comparable with that observed in
$\gamma$-rays for the HESS J1825-137 source. On the other hand, the XMM-Newton
study of the region including PSR J1826-1256 reveals an elongated non-thermal
X-ray emitting nebula with the pulsar located in the northern border and a tail
towards the peak of the very high energy source. The spectrum is characterized
by a power law with a photon index going from 1.6 around the pulsar to 2.7 in
the borders of the nebula, a behaviour consistent with synchrotron cooling of
electrons. From our X-ray analysis we propose that HESS J1826-130 is likely
produced by the PWN powered by PSR J1826-1256 via the inverse Compton
mechanism.

quark evolution inside the QGP, in which heavy quarks first undergo a
rare-scattering multiple-emission evolution at momenta large compared to their

then evolve through a single-scattering induced emission (Gunion-Bertsch) stage
at momenta comparable to their mass [sensitive to not only $\hat{q}$, but also
the longitudinal drag $\hat{e}$ and diffusion $\hat{e}_2$ coefficients]. This
multi-stage approach is coupled to a (2+1)-D viscous hydrodynamic model for a
quantitative investigation of charm vs. beauty quark energy loss inside the

considerable impact on the energy loss of intermediate $p_T$ massive beauty

in this paper we show that open-loop minimum-energy controls can be learned
exactly from experimental data, with a finite number of control experiments

indispensable scientific task. Modern stochastic approaches to searching for
these configurations depend on the optimisation of structures to nearby local
minima in the energy landscape. In many cases these local minima are relatively
high in energy, and inspection reveals that they are trapped, tangled, or
otherwise frustrated in their descent to a lower energy configuration.
Strategies have been developed which attempt to overcome these traps, such as
classical and quantum annealing, basin/minima hopping, evolutionary algorithms
and swarm based methods. Random structure search makes no attempt to avoid the
local minima, and benefits from a broad and uncorrelated sampling of
configuration space. It has been particularly successful in the first
principles prediction of unexpected new phases of dense matter. Here it is
demonstrated that by starting the structural optimisations in a higher
dimensional space, or hyperspace, many of the traps can be avoided, and that
the probability of reaching low energy configurations is much enhanced.
Excursions into the extra dimensions are progressively eliminated through the
application of a growing energetic penalty. This approach is tested on hard
cases for random search - clusters, compounds, and covalently bonded networks.
The improvements observed are most dramatic for the most difficult ones. Random
structure search is shown to be typically accelerated by two orders of
magnitude, and more for particularly challenging systems. This increase in
performance is expected to benefit all approaches to structure prediction that
rely on the local optimisation of stochastically generated structures.

smooth enough, SARSA has been shown to converge asymptotically
\cite{perkins2003convergent,melo2008analysis}. However, its non-asymptotic

the fact that the behavior policy changes dynamically with time. In this paper,
we develop a novel technique to explicitly characterize the stochastic bias of
a type of stochastic approximation procedures with time-varying Markov

this type of stochastic approximation algorithms, which may be of independent

travel industry. Yet, conventional pricing strategies are based on business
rules that are poorly optimized and do not respond to changing market
conditions. This paper describes the dynamic pricing model developed by Deepair
solutions, an AI technology provider for travel suppliers. We present a pricing
model that provides dynamic pricing recommendations specific to each customer
interaction and optimizes expected revenue per customer. The unique nature of
personalized pricing provides the opportunity to search over the market space
to find the optimal price-point of each ancillary for each customer, without
violating customer privacy. In this paper, we present and compare three
approaches for dynamic pricing of ancillaries, with increasing levels of
sophistication: (1) a two-stage forecasting and optimization model using a
logistic mapping function; (2) a two-stage model that uses a deep neural
network for forecasting, coupled with a revenue maximization technique using
discrete exhaustive search; (3) a single-stage end-to-end deep neural network
that recommends the optimal price. We describe the performance of these models
based on both offline and online evaluations. We also measure the real-world
business impact of these approaches by deploying them in an A/B test on an
airline's internet booking website. We show that traditional machine learning
techniques outperform human rule-based approaches in an online setting by
improving conversion by 36% and revenue per offer by 10%. We also provide
results for our offline experiments which show that deep learning algorithms
outperform traditional machine learning techniques for this problem. Our
end-to-end deep learning model is currently being deployed by the airline in

Using the correspondence with the XX spin chain, we obtain an exact closed-form
expression for $\mathcal F_d$ and compute the leading terms in its $1/N$
asymptotic expansion as a function of $x = N_A/N$, where $N$ is the lattice
width at the top of the pants and $N_A$ is the width of the leg where the

  We compute a second instance $\mathcal {\tilde F}_2$ of the bipartite
fidelity for $d=2$ by imposing a different rule for the connection of the
defects. In the conformal setting, this choice corresponds to inserting two
boundary condition changing fields of weight $\Delta = 0$ that are logarithmic
instead of primary. We compute the asymptotic expansion in this case as well

$-2\log((1+x)/(2\sqrt{x}))$. We confirm this lattice result with a CFT
derivation and find that this correction term is identical for all logarithmic
theories, independently of $c$ and $\Delta$.

zero Lyapunov exponent their classical and quantum properties are involved due
to scattering on singular vertices. It is demonstrated that in the
semiclassical limit multiple singular scattering on such vertices when optical
boundaries of many scatters overlap leads to vanishing of quantum wave
functions along straight lines built by these scatters. This phenomenon has an
especially important consequence for polygonal billiards where periodic orbits
(when they exist) form pencils of parallel rays restricted from the both sides
by singular vertices. Due to singular scattering on boundary vertices, waves
propagated inside periodic orbit pencils in the semiclassical limit tend to
zero along pencil boundaries thus forming weakly interacting quasi-modes.
Contrary to scars in chaotic systems the discussed quasi-modes in polygonal
billiards become almost exact for high-excited states and for brevity they are
designated as superscars. Many pictures of eigenfunctions for a triangular
billiard and a barrier billiard which have clear superscar structures are
presented in the paper. Special attention is given to the development of
quantitative methods of detecting and analysing such superscars. In particular,
it is demonstrated that the overlap between superscar waves associated with a
fixed periodic orbit and eigenfunctions of a barrier billiard is distributed
according to the Breit-Wigner distribution typical for weakly interacting
quasi-modes (or doorway states). For special sub-class of rational polygonal
billiards called Veech polygons where all periodic orbits can be calculated
analytically it is argued and checked numerically that their eigenfunctions are
fractal in the Fourier space.

regarded as too young to comprehend the concept of online privacy. Limited
research studies have focused on children of this age group. In the summer of
2018, we conducted 12 focus group studies with 29 children aged 6-10 from
Oxfordshire primary schools. Our research has shown that children have a good
understanding of certain privacy risks, such as information oversharing or
avoiding revealing real identities online. They could use a range of
descriptions to articulate the risks and describe their risk coping strategies.
However, at the same time, we identified that children had less awareness
concerning other risks, such as online tracking or game promotions.
  Inspired by Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), this study has
identified critical knowledge gaps in children's understanding of online
privacy, and several directions for future education and technology
development. We call for attention to the needs of raising children's awareness
and understanding of risks related to online recommendations and data tracking,
which are becoming ever more prevalent in the games and content children
encounter. We also call for attention to children's use of language to describe
risks, which may be appropriate but not necessarily indicate a full

of gravity in which the entire cosmic background evolution is due to a complex
scalar field evolving in Minkowski spacetime, such that its (dimensional)
modulus is conformally coupled, and the (dimensionless) phase is only minimally
coupled to gravitation. The former regulates the dynamics of masses;
cosmological redshift reflects the growth of particle masses over cosmological
time scales, not space expansion. An interplay between the energy density of
radiation and that of the kinetic energy associated with the phase (which are
of opposite relative signs) results in a non-singular cosmological model that
encompasses the observed redshifting phase preceded by a turnaround that
follows a blushifting phase. The model is essentially free of any horizon,
flatness or anisotropy problems. Quantum excitations of the phase during the
matter dominated blueshifting era generate a flat spectrum of adiabatic
gaussian scalar perturbations on cosmological scales. No detectable primordial
tensor modes are generated in this scenario, and cold dark matter must be

time and labor loss for the institutions. Statistical or heuristic methods are
used to remove or at least minimize these losses. In this study, an artificial

using artificial neural networks for businesses. The data are obtained from a
refectory database of a private institution with a capacity of 110 people

crowd flows throughout a city based on coarse-grained observations. This task
is challenging due to two reasons: the spatial correlations between coarse- and
fine-grained urban flows, and the complexities of external impacts. To tackle
these issues, we develop a method entitled UrbanFM based on deep neural
networks. Our model consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to
generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs by using a
feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a
general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the
influences of different external factors. Extensive experiments on two

significant variations in the dataset (e.g. class interval, image completion,

predict kernels which are convolved with a set of successively taken images

approach called Multi-Kernel Prediction Networks (MKPN) for burst image
denoising. MKPN predicts kernels of not just one size but of varying sizes and
performs fusion of these different kernels resulting in one kernel per pixel.
The advantages of our method are two fold: (a) the different sized kernels help
in extracting different information from the image which results in better
reconstruction and (b) kernel fusion assures retaining of the extracted
information while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results
reveal that MKPN outperforms state-of-the-art on our synthetic datasets with

possibly complex constant value to this normally null-mean signal has a
non-trivial warping effect. Among other consequences, this introduces a level
of sensitivity to the amplitude fluctuations and average relative phase. By
means of simulations of Roessler systems and experiments on single-transistor

an empirical value in improving the inference of the structural couplings from
the dynamics. When tentatively applied to the electroencephalogram recorded

Multi-layered Mie theory and discrete dipole approximation (DDA) were used to

per unit refractive index is defined as the sensitivity, and interesting

theory of Green and Naghdi of type-III (GN-III) to account for the interactions
between the elastic, thermal as well as magnetic fields. A general dispersion
relation for coupled waves is deduced to ascertain the nature of waves
propagating through the medium. Perturbation technique has been employed to
obtain the solution of dispersion relation for small thermo-elastic coupling
parameter and identify three different types of waves. We specially analyze the
nature of important wave components like, phase velocity, specific loss and
penetration depth of all three modes of waves. We attempt to compute these wave
components numerically to observe their variations with frequency. The effect
of presence of magnetic field is analyzed. Comparative results under theories
of type GN-I, II and III have been presented numerically in which we have found
that the coupled thermoelastic waves are un-attenuated and nondispersive in
case of Green-Naghdi-II model which is completely in contrast with the theories
of type-I and type-III. Furthermore, the thermal mode wave is observed to
propagate with finite phase velocity in case of GN-II model, whereas the phase
velocity of thermal mode wave is found to be an increasing function of
frequency in other two cases. We achieve significant variations among the
results predicted by all three theories.
