$O(T^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. In contrast, first-order
methods can be used to achieve a $O(T^{-1})$ dependence on iterations, yet
these methods have been less successful in practice. In this work we present
the first CFR variant that breaks the square-root dependence on iterations. By
combining and extending recent advances on predictive and stable regret
minimizers for the matrix-game setting we show that it is possible to leverage
""optimistic"" regret minimizers to achieve a $O(T^{-3/4})$ convergence rate

stable-predictivity, and by setting the stability of each counterfactual regret
minimizer relative to its location in the decision tree. Experiments show that
this method is faster than the original CFR algorithm, although not as fast as
newer variants, in spite of their worst-case $O(T^{-1/2})$ dependence on

definition, is a crucial element towards the deployment of effective and
accurate intelligent systems. This thesis will focus on a family of transfer
learning methods applied to the task of visual object recognition, specifically
image classification. Transfer learning is a general term, and specific
settings have been given specific names: when the learner has only access to
unlabeled data from the a target domain and labeled data from a different
domain (the source), the problem is known as that of ""unsupervised domain

camera. Unfortunately, the depth modality is rarely used for visual recognition
due to the lack of pretrained models from which to transfer and little data to
train one on from scratch. Two methods for dealing with this scenario will be

The prediction of the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to a panel of drugs is a
multivariate regression problem with high-dimensional heterogeneous multi-omics
data as input data and with potentially strong correlations between the outcome
variables which represent the sensitivity to the different drugs. We propose a
joint penalized regression approach with structured penalty terms which allow
us to utilize the correlation structure between drugs with group-lasso-type
penalties and at the same time address the heterogeneity between omics data
sources by introducing data-source-specific penalty factors to penalize
different data sources differently. By combining integrative penalty factors
(IPF) with tree-guided group lasso, we create the IPF-tree-lasso method. We
present a unified framework to transform more general IPF-type methods to the

parameters, we demonstrate how the interval-search Efficient Parameter
Selection via Global Optimization (EPSGO) algorithm can be used to optimize
multiple penalty parameters efficiently. Simulation studies show that
IPF-tree-lasso can improve the prediction performance compared to other

sampling. Moreover, today's pulsed lidar scanners suffer from high cost, power
consumption, large form-factors, and they fail in the presence of strong
backscatter. We depart from point scanning and demonstrate that it is possible
to turn a low-cost CMOS gated imager into a dense depth camera with at least
80m range - by learning depth from three gated images. The proposed
architecture exploits semantic context across gated slices, and is trained on a
synthetic discriminator loss without the need of dense depth labels. The
proposed replacement for scanning lidar systems is real-time, handles
back-scatter and provides dense depth at long ranges. We validate our approach
in simulation and on real-world data acquired over 4,000km driving in northern
Europe. Data and code are available at https://github.com/gruberto/Gated2Depth.

Allen-Cahn equation by replacing the Laplacian with a parameterized nonlocal
diffusion operator, and satisfies the maximum principle as its local
counterpart. In this paper, we develop and analyze first and second order
exponential time differencing (ETD) schemes for solving the NAC equation, which
unconditionally preserve the discrete maximum principle. The fully discrete
numerical schemes are obtained by applying the stabilized ETD approximations
for time integration with the quadrature-based finite difference discretization
in space. We derive their respective optimal maximum-norm error estimates and
further show that the proposed schemes are asymptotically compatible, i.e., the
approximate solutions always converge to the classic Allen-Cahn solution when
the horizon, the spatial mesh size and the time step size go to zero. We also
prove that the schemes are energy stable in the discrete sense. Various
experiments are performed to verify these theoretical results and to
investigate numerically the relation between the discontinuities and the

evidence for a thick, diffuse molecular disk that is distinct from the thin

found here suggests that M33 has a marginal thick molecular disk. From

dynamics and the gamma-ray emission produced when the bubbles formed by red
giant winds penetrate the jet of a blazar in an elliptical galaxy. First, we
characterized the masses and penetration rates of the red giant wind bubbles
that enter the jet. Then, the dynamical evolution of these bubbles under the
jet impact was analysed analytically and numerically, and the radiation losses
of the particles accelerated in the interaction were characterised. Finally,
the synchrotron and the inverse Compton contributions above 100 MeV were
estimated under different jet magnetic fields, powers, and Lorentz factors. We
find that an analytical dynamical model is a reasonable approximation for the
red giant wind bubble-jet interaction. The radiation produced by these wind
bubbles interacting with a jet can have a duty cycle of up to 1. For realistic
magnetic fields, gamma rays could be detectable from sources within the local
universe, preferentially from those with high Lorentz factors (of about 10),
and this could be a relatively common phenomenon for these sources. For
magnetic fields in equipartition with the jet power, and high acceleration
rates, synchrotron gamma rays may be detectable even for modest Lorentz factors
(of about 3), but with a much lower duty cycle.

derivatives is said to be quasianalytic if the boundary value of a non-zero
function from the class can not have a zero of infinite multiplicity. Such
classes were described in the 1950-s and 1960-s by Carleson, Rodrigues-Salinas
and Korenblum. A non-zero function from a quasianalytic space of analytic
functions can only have a finite number of zeros in the closed disc. Recently,
Borichev, Frank, and Volberg proved an explicit estimate on the number of
zeros, for the case of quasianalytic Gevrey classes. Here, an estimate of
similar form for general analytic quasianalytic classes is proved using a
reduction to the classical quasianalyticity problem.

considered as a model to determine the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients.
The influence of the interstitial gas on solid particles is modeled by a
viscous drag force term plus a stochastic Langevin-like term. The suspension
model is solved by means of the Chapman--Enskog method conveniently adapted to
dissipative dynamics. The momentum and heat fluxes as well as the cooling rate
are obtained to first order in the deviations of the hydrodynamic field
gradients from their values in the homogeneous steady state. Since the cooling
terms (arising from collisional dissipation and viscous friction) cannot be
compensated for by the energy gained by grains due to collisions with the
interstitial gas, the reference distribution (zeroth-order approximation of the
Chapman--Enskog solution) depends on time through its dependence on
temperature. On the other hand, to simplify the analysis and given that we are
interested in computing transport properties in the first order of deviations
from the reference state, the steady-state conditions are considered. This
simplification allows us to get explicit expressions for the Navier--Stokes
transport coefficients. As expected, the results show that the dependence of
the transport coefficients on both inelasticity and density is clearly
different from that found in its granular counterpart (no gas phase). Finally,
a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations with respect to the
homogeneous steady state is performed. In contrast to the granular case (no
gas-phase), no instabilities are found and hence, the homogeneous steady state
is (linearly) stable.

mainly by fitting multiplicities data for SIDIS, where the intrinsic motion in
the initial parton distributions and in the hadronisation process are strongly
correlated and difficult to estimate separately without ambiguities. In this
contribution we discuss the consequences of this correlation effects on the
predictions for the Sivers and Collins asymmetries measured in SIDIS and
$e^+e^-$ annihilations, and under active investigation for Drell-Yan processes

aspects of TMDs, like the evolution properties of the Sivers and Collins
functions and the expected process dependence of the Sivers function.

the full short-range Fock exchange and a fraction of the long-range Fock
exchange that equals the inverse of the dielectric constant, both DD-RSH-CAM

($m_t$) determination, issue which persists in being highly controversial. In
the first part of the thesis, we investigate the presence of linear renormalons
in observables that can be employed to determine the top mass. We considered a
simplified toy model to describe $W^{*} \rightarrow t \bar{b} \to Wb \bar{b}$.
The computation is carried out in the limit of a large number of flavours
($n_f$), using a new method that allows to easily evaluate any infrared safe
observable at order $\alpha_s(\alpha_s n_f)^n$ for any $n$. The second part of
the thesis is devoted to the comparison of several NLO generators for top-pair
production, implemented in the POWHEG BOX framework, that differ by the level
of accuracy employed to describe the top decay. The impact of the shower Monte
Carlo programs, used to complete the NLO events generated by POWHEG BOX, is
also studied. In particular, we discuss the two most widely used shower Monte
Carlo programs, i.e. Pythia 8.2 and Herwig 7.1, and we present a method to
interface them with processes that contain decayed emitting resonances.

to severely limit any change in total linewidth. Here we show that the
transverse coherence of exciton emission in the monolayer two-dimensional (2D)
material MoSe${}_2$ removes many of the fundamental physical limitations
present in previous experiments. The coherent interaction between excitons and
a photonic mode localized between the MoSe${}_2$ and a nearby planar mirror
depends interferometrically on mirror position, enabling full control over the
radiative coupling rate from near-zero to 1.8 meV and a corresponding change in
exciton total linewidth from 0.9 to 2.3 meV. The highly radiatively broadened
exciton resonance (a ratio of up to $3:1$ in our samples) necessary to observe
this modulation is made possible by recent advances in 2D materials sample
fabrication. Our method of mirror translation is free of any coupling to strain
or DC electric field in the monolayer, which allows a fundamental study of this
photonic effect. The weak coherent driving field in our experiments yields a
mean excitation occupation number of ${\sim} 10^{-3}$ such that our experiments
correspond to probing radiative reaction in the regime of perturbative quantum
electrodynamics. This system will serve as a testbed for exploring new

calculated Maxwellian-averaged cross sections and fitted them with bivariate
polynomials for solar wind temperatures ranging from $10^5$ to $10^6$ K
($12-130$ eV). Single- and double-electron captures by He$^{2+}$ dominate at
typical solar wind speeds. Correspondingly, single-electron capture by H$^+$
and single-electron loss by H$^-$ dominate at these speeds, resulting in the
production of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). Ionization cross sections all
peak at energies above $20$ keV and are expected to play a moderate role in the
total ion production. The effect of solar wind Maxwellian temperatures is found
to be maximum for cross sections peaking at higher energies, suggesting that
local heating at shock structures in cometary and planetary environments may
favor processes previously thought to be negligible.

control. Numerical simulations of the nonlinear transitional regime in a
Blasius boundary layer are performed where streaks are excited in the boundary
layer via a high level of free-stream turbulence (FST). The occurring
disturbances are measured via localized wall sensors and damped via near-wall
actuators resembling plasma actuators. The time-varying amplitude of the signal
of each actuator is computed by processing signals from the sensors. This
processing is the result of two control laws: the Linear Quadratic Gaussian
regulator (LQG) and the Inverse Feed-Forward Control technique (IFFC). The use
of the first, LQG, requires a state-space representation of the system
dynamics, so the flow is described via an operator that captures only the most
relevant information of the dynamics and results in a reduced order model
(ROM). The ROM is computed via the eigensystem realization algorithm, based on
the impulse responses of the real system. Collecting such impulse responses may
be unfeasible when considering FST because of the high dimensionality of the
input forcing needed for a precise description of such a phenomenon. Here, a
new method to identify the relevant system dynamics and generate the needed
impulse responses is proposed, in a data-driven approach that would be
realizable in experiments. Finally, the effectiveness of the technique in
delaying bypass transition is shown. The work (i) presents a systematic way to
deal with high dimensional disturbances to build ROMs for a control technique,
and (ii) shows that even when considering constraints such as the type and size
of actuators and sensors, it is possible to achieve at least as large delay of
bypass transition as that obtained in more idealized cases found in literature.

propagate origin-destination information (and any vehicle-specific

are computed in the Eulerian representation, and are used to calculate the
speed of vehicles crossing the boundary. Simple examples are included that show
the convergence of the model and its agreements with the available analytical
solutions. We find that (i) when origins and destinations are uniformly
distributed in a region, the distribution of the travel times can be
approximated analytically, (ii) the magnitude of the detours from the optimal
free-flow route due to congestion increase linearly with the inflow and
decreases with the square of the speed, and (iii) the total delay of vehicles

dark photon exhibiting exclusively visible or invisible decays. In this work,
we revisit this idea and consider a model where $A^{\prime}$ couples
inelastically to dark matter and an excited dark sector state, leading to a
more exotic decay topology we refer to as a semi-visible decay. We show that
for large mass splittings between the dark sector states this decay mode is
enhanced, weakening the previous invisibly decaying dark photon bounds. As a
consequence, $A^{\prime}$ resolves the $g_{\mu} - 2$ anomaly in a region of
parameter space the thermal dark matter component of the Universe is readily
explained. Interestingly, it is possible that the semi-visible events we
discuss may have been vetoed by experiments searching for invisible dark photon
decays. A re-analysis of the data and future searches may be crucial in
uncovering this exotic decay mode or closing the window on the dark photon

technical simplification over the BH scalarisation that has been conjectured to
occur in extended Scalar-Tensor Gauss-Bonnet (eSTGB) models. It is then natural
to ask: 1) how universal are the conclusions extracted from the EMS model? And
2) how much do these conclusions depend on the choice of the non-minimal
coupling function? Here we perform a comparative analysis of different forms
for the coupling function including: exponential, hyperbolic, power-law and a
rational function (fraction) couplings. In all of them we obtain and study the
domain of existence of fundamental, spherically symmetric, scalarised BHs and
compute, in particular, their entropy. The latter shows that scalarised EMS BHs
are always entropically preferred over the RN BHs with the same total charge to
mass ratio $q$. This contrasts with the case of eSTGB, where for the same
power-law coupling the spherical, fundamental scalarised BHs are not
entropically preferred over Schwarzschild. Also, while the scalarised solutions
in the EMS model for the exponential, hyperbolic and power-law coupling are
very similar, the rational function coupling leads to a transition in the
domain of existence. Furthermore, fully non-linear dynamical evolutions of
unstable RN BHs with different values of $q$ are presented. These show: 1) for
sufficiently small $q$, scalarised solutions with (approximately) the same $q$
form dynamically; 2) for large $q$, spontaneous scalarisation visibly decreases
$q$; thus evolutions are non-conservative; 3) despite the existence of
non-spherical, static scalarised solutions, the evolution of unstable RN BHs
under non-spherical perturbations leads to a spherical scalarised BH.

a class of causal set theories, called energetic causal sets (ECS). These are
discrete sets of events, connected by causal relations. They have three orders:
(1) a birth order, which is the order in which events are generated; this is a
total order which is the true causal order, (2) a dynamical partial order,
which prescribes the flows of energy and momentum amongst events, (3) an
emergent causal order, which is defined by the geometry of an emergent
Minkowski spacetime, in which the events of the causal sets are embedded.
However, the embedding of the events in the emergent Minkowski spacetime may
preserve neither the true causal order in (1), nor correspond completely with
the microscopic partial order in (2). We call this disordered causality, and we
here demonstrate its occurrence in specific ECS models. This is the second in a
series of papers centered around the question: Should we accept violations of
causality as a lesser price to pay in order to keep realist formulations of
quantum theory? We begin to address this in the first paper [1] and continue

nanowires of lengths larger than a few nanometers, even at very low temperature

disorder, that quantum uncertainty of microscopic electric current density
around their (classical) macroscopic values is suppressed, exponentially fast
with respect to the volume of the region of the lattice where an external
electric field is applied. This is in accordance with the above experimental
observation. Disorder is modeled by a random external potential along with
random, complex-valued, hopping amplitudes. The celebrated tight-binding

on the application of fractional calculus to problems of anomalous transport.
In these analyses, the anomalous transport (of charge, tracers, fluid, etc.) is
presumed attributable to long-range correlations of material properties within
an inherently complex, and in some cases self-similar, conducting medium.
Rather than considering an exquisitely discretized (and computationally
intractable) representation of the medium, the complex and spatially correlated
heterogeneity is represented through reformulation of the PDE governing the
relevant transport physics such that its coefficients are, instead, smooth but
paired with fractional-order space derivatives. Here we apply these concepts to
the scalar Helmholtz equation and its use in electromagnetic interrogation of
Earth's interior through the magnetotelluric method. We outline a practical
algorithm for solving the Helmholtz equation using spectral methods coupled
with finite element discretization. Execution of this algorithm for the
magnetotelluric problem reveals several interesting features observable in
field data: long--range correlation of the predicted electromagnetic fields; a
power-law relationship between the squared impedance amplitude and squared
wavenumber whose slope is a function of the fractional exponent within the
governing Helmholtz equation; and, a non-constant apparent resistivity spectrum
whose variability arises solely from the fractional exponent. In geologic
settings characterized by self--similarity (e.g. fracture systems; thick and
richly-textured sedimentary sequences, etc.) we posit that diagnostics are
useful for geologic characterization of features far below the typical
resolution limit of electromagnetic methods in geophysics.

We identify the water emission arising from the CND, the Western Streamer, and

K for the CND, and the lower X$_{\rm H_2O}$ of 4$\times$10$^{-8}$ and V$_t$ of

effects are responsible for the water excitation in the southwest lobe of the
CND and the 20 km s$^{-1}$ cloud, whereas only collisions can account for the
water excitation in the northeast lobe of the CND. We propose that the water
vapor in the CND is caused by grain sputtering by shocks of 10-20 km s$^{-1}$,
with some contribution of high temperature and cosmic-ray chemistries plus a
PDR chemistry. The low X$_{\rm H_2O}$ derived for the 20 km s$^{-1}$ cloud

energies 5 orders of magnitude lower than optical photons, and are therefore
ineffective at triggering measurable phenomena at macroscopic scales. Here, we
report the observation of a new type of interaction between a single two level
system (qubit) and a microwave resonator. These two quantum systems do not
interact coherently, instead, they share a common dissipative mechanism to a
cold bath: the qubit irreversibly switches to its excited state if and only if
a photon enters the resonator. We have used this highly correlated dissipation
mechanism to detect itinerant photons impinging on the resonator. This scheme
does not require any prior knowledge of the photon waveform nor its arrival
time, and dominant decoherence mechanisms do not trigger spurious detection
events (dark counts). We demonstrate a detection efficiency of 58% and a record
low dark count rate of 1.4 per ms. This work establishes engineered non-linear
dissipation as a key-enabling resource for a new class of low-noise non-linear
microwave detectors.

last to be given up when seeking a better interpretation of quantum mechanics.
We examine the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory as a well developed example of
a realistic theory. We present three challenges to a naive reading of
pilot-wave theory, each based on a system of several entangled particles. With
the help of a coarse graining of pilot wave theory into a discrete system, we
show how these challenges can be answered. However this comes with a cost. In
the description of individual systems, particles appear to scatter off empty
branches of the wave function as if they were particles, and conversely travel
through particles as if they were waves. More generally, the ""particles"" of
pilot wave theory are led by the guidance equation to move in ways no classical
particle would, involving apparent violations of the principles of inertia and
momentum conservation.We next argue that the aforementioned cost can be avoided
within a retrocausal model. In the proposed version of the pilot wave theory,
the particle is guided by a combination of advanced and retarded waves. The
resulting account for quantum physics seems to have greater heuristic power, it
demands less damage to intuition, and moreover provides some general hints
regarding spacetime and causality. This is the first of two papers. In the
second [1] we show that, in the context of an explicit model, retrocausality,
with respect to an effective, emergent spacetime metric, can coexist with a
strict irreversibility of causal processes.

scattering frequency of the BEC atoms as well as the spring coefficient of the
cavity moving end-mirror (the mechanical oscillator) are parametrically
modulated. It is shown that in the red-detuned regime and under the so-called
impedance-matching condition, the mechanical response of the system to the
input signal is enhanced substantially, which leads to the amplification of the
weak input signal while the added noises of measurement (backaction noises) can
be suppressed and lowered much below the standard quantum limit (SQL). In this

long-range interactions of wave sources embedded in 3-D layered media. The
layered media Green's function for the Helmholtz equation, which satisfies the
transmission conditions at material interfaces, is decomposed into a free space
component and four types of reaction field components arising from wave
reflections and transmissions through the layered media. The proposed algorithm
is a combination of the classic FMM for the free space component and FMMs
specifically designed for the four types reaction components, made possible by
new multipole expansions (MEs) and local expansions (LEs) as well as the
multipole-to-local translation (M2L) operators for the reaction field
components. { Moreover, equivalent polarization source can be defined for each
reaction component based on the convergence analysis of its ME. The FMMs for
the reaction components, implemented with the target particles and equivalent
polarization sources, are found to be much more efficient than the classic FMM
for the free space component due to the fact that the equivalent polarization
sources and the target particles are always separated by a material interface.}
As a result, the FMM algorithm developed for layered media has a similar
computational cost as that for the free space. Numerical results validate the
fast convergence of the MEs and the $O(N)$ complexity of the FMM for
interactions of low-frequency wave sources in 3-D layered media.

virtual-machine-introspection-based security monitors to protect virtual
machines in cloud computing, such as monitoring dentry objects to intercept
file operations, etc. However, most of the current virtual machine monitors,
such as KVM and Xen, only support page-level monitoring, because the Intel EPT
technology can only monitor page privilege. If the out-of-virtual-machine
security tools want to monitor some kernel objects, they need to intercept the
operation of the whole memory page. Since there are some other objects stored
in the monitored pages, the modification of them will also trigger the monitor.
Therefore, page-level memory monitor usually introduces overhead to related
kernel services of the target virtual machine. In this paper, we propose a
low-overhead kernel object monitoring approach to reduce the overhead caused by
page-level monitor. The core idea is to migrate the target kernel objects to a
protected memory area and then to monitor the corresponding new memory pages.
Since the new pages only contain the kernel objects to be monitored, other
kernel objects will not trigger our monitor. Therefore, our monitor will not
introduce runtime overhead to the related kernel service. The experimental
results show that our system can monitor target kernel objects effectively only
with very low overhead.

is particularly strong for untangled (i.e. non-concatenated and unknotted)

using a computationally efficient multi-scale approach, where we combine
massive simulations on the fiber level with the explicit construction of
untangled ring melt configurations based on theoretical ideas for their large
scale structure. We find (i) that topological constraints may be neglected on
scales below the standard entanglement length, $L_e$, (ii) that rings with a
size $1 \le L_r/L_e \le 30$ exhibit nearly ideal lattice tree behavior
characterized by primitive paths which are randomly branched on the
entanglement scale, and (iii) that larger rings are compact with gyration radii
$\langle R_g^2(L_r) \rangle \propto L_r^{2/3}$. The detailed comparison between
equilibrated and constructed ensembles allows us to perform a `Feynman test' of
our understanding of untangled rings: can we convert ideas for the large-scale
ring structure into algorithms for constructing (nearly) equilibrated ring melt
samples? We show that most structural observables are quantitatively reproduced
by two different construction schemes: hierarchical crumpling and ring melts
derived from the analogy to interacting branched polymers. However, the latter
fail the `Feynman test' with respect to the magnetic radius, $R_m$, which we
have defined based on an analogy to magnetostatics. While $R_m$ is expected to
vanish for double-folded structures, the observed values of $\langle R_m^2(L_r)

alpha=1.51+/-0.10 (90% confidence level).
  The NuSTAR counts in the 8-24 keV band present a steeper slope with alpha =

chandra counts.
  Next, we compare the derived number counts in the different bands using our
X-ray AGN population synthesis models.
  The comparison between the Chandra and the Swift/BAT number counts shows a
very good agreement for the 'standard' AGN spectrum with a power-law slope
Gamma=1.9, a high energy cut-off at ~130 keV and a 2-10 keV reflection

classic functional MRI approaches. However, it remains unclear whether dfMRI
measures result from changes in the intra-/extracellular environment, perfusion
and/or T2 values. We designed an acquisition/quantification scheme to
disentangle such effects in the motor cortex during a finger tapping paradigm.
dfMRI was acquired at specific diffusion weightings to selectively suppress
perfusion and free-water diffusion, then times series of the apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC-fMRI) and of the perfusion signal fraction (IVIM-fMRI) were
derived. ADC-fMRI provided ADC estimates sensitive to changes in perfusion and
free-water volume, but not to T2/T2* values. With IVIM-fMRI we isolated the
perfusion contribution to ADC, while suppressing T2 effects. Compared to
conventional gradient-echo BOLD fMRI, activation maps obtained with dfMRI and
ADC-fMRI had smaller clusters, and the spatial overlap between the three
techniques was below 50%. Increases of perfusion fractions were observed during
task in both dfMRI and ADC-fMRI activations. Perfusion effects were more
prominent with ADC-fMRI than with dfMRI but were significant in less than 25%
of activation ROIs. Taken together, our results suggest that the sensitivity to
task of dfMRI derives from a decrease of hindered diffusion and an increase of
the pseudo-diffusion signal fraction, leading to different, more confined
spatial activation patterns compared to classic functional MRI.

possible connection to planet formation is currently subject to intense

the gas and dust mass reservoir in the outer disk, while lower mass planets
lead to shallow gaps which are manifested mainly on the dust component. We used
the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the star
HD169142, host to a prominent disk with deep wide gaps that sever the disk into
inner and outer regions. The new ALMA high resolution images allow for the
outer ring to be resolved as three narrow rings. The HD169142 disk thus hosts
both the wide gaps trait of transition disks and a narrow ring system similar
to those observed in the TW Hya and HL Tau systems. The mass reservoir beyond a
deep gap can thus host ring systems. The observed rings are narrow in radial
extent (width/radius of 1.5/57.3, 1.8/64.2 and 3.4/76.0, in au) and have
asymmetric mutual separations: the first and middle ring are separated by 7 au
while the middle and outermost ring are distanced by ~12 au. Using
hydrodynamical modeling we found that a simple explanation, involving a single
migrating low mass planet (10 M$_\oplus$), entirely accounts for such an
apparently complex phenomenon. Inward migration of the planet naturally
explains the ring's asymmetric mutual separation. The isolation of HD169142's
outer rings thus allows a proof of concept to interpret the detailed
architecture of the outer region of protoplanetary disks with low mass planet
formation of mini-Neptune's size, i.e. as in the protosolar nebula.

single set of aligned, vertical cracks in the subsurface. We relax this
assumption and demonstrate the feasibility of seismic characterization of
multiple fracture sets. Our technique relies on recent numerical findings,
indicating that multiple, differently oriented, possibly intersecting planar
cracks embedded in an otherwise isotropic host rock result in a nearly
orthorhombic (or orthotropic) effective medium. Here, the governing parameters
of crack-induced orthotropy are estimated from 3D, wide-azimuth, multicomponent
seismic reflection data acquired over the tight-gas Rulison Field in Colorado,
USA.
  We translate strong azimuthal variations of the normal-moveout velocities
into interval crack densities, fracture orientations, type of fluid infill, and
velocities of the P- and S-waves in an unfractured rock. Our inversion
procedure identifies a set of cracks aligned in approximately WNW-ESE direction
in the western part of the study area and multiple, likely intersecting
fractures in its eastern part. We validate both our underlying theoretical
model and the obtained estimates by two independent measurements: (i) the
estimated fluid-infill parameter indicates dry cracks as expected for the
gas-producing sandstones at Rulison; and (ii) the obtained crack orientations
are supported by measurements in a well. As a by-product of fracture
characterization, we build an anisotropic velocity model of the Rulison
reservoir that, we believe, is the first orthorhombic velocity field
constructed from surface seismic data.

bilayer graphene (tBLG) has sparked tremendous interest, though many aspects of
the system are under intense debate. Here we report observation of both
superconductivity and the Mott-like insulating state in a tBLG device with a
twist angle of approximately 0.93, which is smaller than the magic angle by
15%. At an electron concentration of +/-5 electrons per moire unit cell, we
observe a narrow resistance peak with an activation energy gap of approximately
0.1 meV, indicating the existence of an additional correlated insulating state.
This is consistent with theory predicting the presence of a high-energy band
with an energetically flat dispersion. At a doping of +/-12 electrons per moire
unit cell we observe a resistance peak due to the presence of Dirac points in
the spectrum. Our results reveal that the magic range of tBLG is in fact larger
than what is previously expected, and provide a wealth of new information to
help decipher the strongly correlated phenomena observed in tBLG.

near-linear computational complexity for certain classes of linear systems,
Ax=b. Broadening the scope of problems that AMG can effectively solve requires
the development of improved interpolation operators. Such development is often
based on AMG convergence theory. However, convergence theory in AMG tends to
have a disconnect with AMG in practice due to the practical constraints of (i)
maintaining matrix sparsity in transfer and coarse-grid operators, and (ii)
retaining linear complexity in the setup and solve phase. This paper presents a
review of fundamental results in AMG convergence theory, followed by a
discussion on how these results can be used to motivate interpolation operators
in practice. A general weighted energy minimization functional is then proposed
to form interpolation operators, and a novel `diagonal' preconditioner for
Sylvester- or Lyapunov-type equations developed simultaneously. Although
results based on the weighted energy minimization typically underperform
compared to a fully constrained energy minimization, numerical results provide
new insight into the role of energy minimization and constraint vectors in AMG

of atomistic modeling since the early days, addressing the need of linking the
behavior of individual atoms and the collective properties that are usually the
final quantity of interest. Methods such as clustering and dimensionality
reduction have been used to provide a simplified, coarse-grained representation
of the structure and dynamics of complex systems, from proteins to
nanoparticles. In recent years, the rise of machine learning has led to an even
more widespread use of these algorithms in atomistic modeling, and to consider
different classification and inference techniques as part of a coherent toolbox
of data-driven approaches.
  This perspective briefly reviews some of the unsupervised machine-learning
methods -- that are geared towards classification and coarse-graining of
molecular simulations -- seen in relation to the fundamental mathematical
concepts that underlie all machine-learning techniques. It discusses the
importance of using concise yet complete representations of atomic structures
as the starting point of the analyses, and highlights the risk of introducing
preconceived biases when using machine learning to rationalize and understand
structure-property relations. Supervised machine-learning techniques, that
explicitly attempt to predict the properties of a material given its structure,
are less susceptible to such biases. Current developments in the field suggest
that using these two classes of approaches side-by-side and in a fully
integrated mode, while keeping in mind the relations between the data analysis
framework and the fundamental physical principles, will be key for realizing
the full potential of machine learning to help understanding the behavior of

for many $(N\gg 1)$ interacting agents in which the agent states are
$D$-dimensional unit vectors. It was previously shown that, for even $D$,
similar to the original Kuramoto model ($D=2$), there exists a continuous
dynamical phase transition from incoherence to coherence of the time asymptotic
attracting state as the coupling parameter $K$ increases through a critical
value $K_c^{(+)}>0$. We consider this transition from the point of view of the
stability of an incoherent state, i.e., where the $N\to\infty$ distribution
function is time-independent and the macroscopic order parameter is zero. In
contrast with $D=2$, for even $D>2$ there is an infinity of possible incoherent
equilibria, each of which becomes unstable with increasing $K$ at a different
point $K=K_c$. We show that there are incoherent equilibria for all $K_c$
within the range $(K_c^{(+)}/2)\leq K_c \leq K_c^{(+)}$. How can the possible
instability of incoherent states arising at $K=K_c<K_c^{(+)}$ be reconciled
with the previous finding that, at large time, the state is always incoherent
unless $K>K_c^{(+)}$? We find, for a given incoherent equilibrium, that, if $K$
is rapidly increased from $K<K_c$ to $K_c<K<K_c^{(+)}$, due to the instability,
a short, macroscopic burst of coherence is observed, which initially grows
exponentially, but then reaches a maximum, past which it decays back into
incoherence. After this decay, we observe that the equilibrium has been reset
to one whose $K_c$ value exceeds that of the increased $K$. Thus this process,
which we call `Instability-Mediated Resetting,' leads to an increase in the
effective $K_c$ with continuously increasing $K$, until the equilibrium has
been effectively set to one for which for which $K_c\approx K_c^{(+)}$, leading
to a unique critical point of the time asymptotic state.

(Cellular Neural Network). We first show that there is the similarity between
the dynamics of memristors and neurons. That is, some kind of flux-controlled
memristors can not respond to the sinusoidal voltage source quickly, namely,
they can not switch `on' rapidly. Furthermore, these memristors have refractory
period after switch `on', which means that it can not respond to further
sinusoidal inputs until the flux is decreased. We next show that the
memristor-coupled two-cell CNN can exhibit chaotic behavior. In this system,
the memristors switch `off' and `on' at irregular intervals, and the two cells
are connected when either or both of the memristors switches `on'. We then
propose the modified CNN model, which can hold a binary output image, even if
all cells are disconnected and no signal is supplied to the cell after a
certain point of time. However, the modified CNN requires power to maintain the
output image, that is, it is volatile. We next propose a new memristor CNN
model. It can also hold a binary output state (image), even if all cells are
disconnected, and no signal is supplied to the cell, by memristor's switching
behavior. Furthermore, even if we turn off the power of the system during the
computation, it can resume from the previous average output state, since the
memristor CNN has functions of both short-term (volatile) memory and long-term
(non-volatile) memory. The above suspend and resume feature are useful when we
want to save the current state, and continue work later from the previous
state. Finally, we show that the memristor CNN can exhibit interesting
two-dimensional waves, if an inductor is connected to each memristor CNN cell.

leads to small but measurable ultra-fast polarization state fluctuations at the
fiber output. We provide a phenomenological approach and a theory that
qualitatively corroborates our experimental results. One of our major findings
suggests that the applicability of the often used Manakov equation needs to be
scrutinized for highly accurate studies of nonlinear polarization state
evolutions in noisy environments. The described phenomenon leads to a
qualitatively different microscopic understanding of nonlinear light
propagation in fiber and can contribute towards an explanation for todays
commonly perceived gap between simulated and experimentally obtained system
performance in optical data transmission.

objectives. For these multi-objective tasks, it is oftentimes hard to design a
single control policy that fulfills all the objectives simultaneously. In this
paper, we focus on multi-objective tasks that can be decomposed into a set of
simple subtasks. Controllers for these subtasks are individually designed and
then combined into a control policy for the entire team. One significant
feature of our work is that the subtask controllers are designed along with
their underlying manifolds. When a controller is combined with other
controllers, their associated manifolds are also taken into account. This
formulation yields a policy generation framework for multi-robot systems that
can combine controllers for a variety of objectives while implicitly handling
the interaction among robots and subtasks. To describe controllers on
manifolds, we adopt Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs), and propose a collection
of RMPs for common multi-robot subtasks. Centralized and decentralized
algorithms are designed to combine these RMPs into a final control policy.
Theoretical analysis shows that the system under the control policy is stable.
Moreover, we prove that many existing multi-robot controllers can be closely
approximated by the framework. The proposed algorithms are validated through
both simulated tasks and robotic implementations.

through micro-architectural side-channels which we show are not mere bugs, but
in fact lie at the foundation of optimization. We identify three open problems,
(1) finding side-channels, (2) understanding speculative vulnerabilities, and
(3) mitigating them. For (1) we introduce a mathematical meta-model that
clarifies the source of side-channels in simulations and CPUs. For (2) we
introduce an architectural model with speculative semantics to study
recently-discovered vulnerabilities. For (3) we explore and evaluate software
mitigations and prove one correct for this model. Our analysis is informed by
extensive offensive research and defensive implementation work for V8, the

for effective, efficient mitigation. As a result of our work, we now believe
that speculative vulnerabilities on today's hardware defeat all

e.g., inter-rater agreement, assay validation, a mapping between the two
metrics is missing, till date. While minimisation of $L_p$ norm of the errors
or of its positive powers (e.g., $MSE$) is aimed at $\rho_c$ maximisation, we
reason the often-witnessed ineffectiveness of this popular loss function with
graphical illustrations. The discovered formula uncovers not only the
counterintuitive revelation that `$MSE_1<MSE_2$' does not imply
`$\rho_{c_1}>\rho_{c_2}$', but also provides the precise range for the $\rho_c$

for a given $MSE$; and as a logical next step, for a given set of errors. We
generalise and discover the conditions for any given $L_p$ norm, for an even p.
We present newly discovered, albeit apparent, mathematical paradoxes. The study
inspires and anticipates a growing use of $\rho_c$-inspired loss functions

management is investigated for a wireless VR network in which VR contents are
sent by a cloud to cellular small base stations (SBSs). The SBSs will collect
tracking data from the VR users, over the uplink, in order to generate the VR
content and transmit it to the end-users using downlink cellular links. For
this model, the data requested or transmitted by the users can exhibit
correlation, since the VR users may engage in the same immersive virtual
environment with different locations and orientations. As such, the proposed
resource management framework can factor in such spatial data correlation, to
better manage uplink and downlink traffic. This potential spatial data
correlation can be factored into the resource allocation problem to reduce the
traffic load in both uplink and downlink. In the downlink, the cloud can
transmit 360 contents or specific visible contents that are extracted from the
original 360 contents to the users according to the users' data correlation to
reduce the backhaul traffic load. For uplink, each SBS can associate with the
users that have similar tracking information so as to reduce the tracking data
size. This data correlation-aware resource management problem is formulated as
an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' successful
transmission probability, defined as the probability that the content
transmission delay of each user satisfies an instantaneous VR delay target. To
solve this problem, an echo state networks (ESNs) based transfer learning is
introduced. By smartly transferring information on the SBS's utility, the
proposed transfer-based ESN algorithm can quickly cope with changes in the
wireless networking environment.

challenging research field. The cutting procedure requires a robot to
concurrently manipulate a scissor and a gripper to cut through a predefined
contour trajectory on the deformable sheet. The gripper ensures the cutting
accuracy by nailing a point on the sheet and continuously tensioning the pinch
point to different directions while the scissor is in action. The goal is to
find a pinch point and a corresponding tensioning policy to minimize damage to
the material and increase cutting accuracy measured by the symmetric difference
between the predefined contour and the cut contour. Previous study considers
finding one fixed pinch point during the course of cutting, which is inaccurate
and unsafe when the contour trajectory is complex. In this paper, we examine
the soft tissue cutting task by using multiple pinch points, which imitates
human operations while cutting. This approach, however, does not require the
use of a multi-gripper robot. We use a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to
find an optimal tensioning policy of a pinch point. Simulation results show

was proposed for its elimination [D.H. Dowell, F. Zhou, and J. Schmerge, PRAB
21, 010101 (2018)]. This aberration arises when the beam acquires an asymmetric
distribution that is then rotated with respect to the transverse reference axis
thus introducing a correlation in the vertical and horizontal planes. The
asymmetry is introduced by a weak quadrupole field in the rf gun or emittance
compensation solenoid and the rotation is caused by the solenoid. This Letter
presents an experimental study of the coupled transverse dynamics aberration in
an rf photoinjector and demonstrates its elimination by a quadrupole corrector
consisting of a normal and a skew quadrupole. The experimental results agree
well with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. The study also
demonstrates the emittance of a low charge beam can be preserved during
transportation at its thermal value, which was 1.05 mm mrad/mm, for the cesium

science goals. However, spectroscopic data will be available for only a small
fraction of these sources, and in most cases even the optical and infrared
photometry will be of limited quality. Furthermore, radio sources tend to be at
higher redshift than most optical sources and so a significant fraction of
radio sources hosts differ from those for which most photometric redshift
templates are designed. We therefore need to develop new techniques for
estimating the redshifts of radio sources. As a starting point in this process,
we evaluate a number of machine-learning techniques for estimating redshift,
together with a conventional template-fitting technique. We pay special
attention to how the performance is affected by the incompleteness of the
training sample and by sparseness of the parameter space or by limited
availability of ancillary multi-wavelength data. As expected, we find that the
quality of the photometric-redshift degrades as the quality of the photometry
decreases, but that even with the limited quality of photometry available for
all sky-surveys, useful redshift information is available for the majority of
sources, particularly at low redshift. We find that a template-fitting
technique performs best with high-quality and almost complete multi-band
photometry, especially if radio sources that are also X-ray emitting are
treated separately. When we reduced the quality of photometry to match that
available for the EMU all-sky radio survey, the quality of the template-fitting
degraded and became comparable to some of the machine learning methods. Machine
learning techniques currently perform better at low redshift than at high
redshift, because of incompleteness of the currently available training data at
high redshifts.

multiplicative linear logic (MLL) proof nets. We show that, provided we impose
a constraint on some paths, we can bound the size of all the nets satisfying
this constraint and reducing to a fixed resultant net. This result gives a
sufficient condition for an infinite weighted sum of nets to reduce into
another sum of nets, while keeping coefficients finite. We moreover show that
our constraints are stable under reduction.
  Our approach is motivated by the quantitative semantics of linear logic: many
models have been proposed, whose structure reflect the Taylor expansion of
multiplicative exponential linear logic (MELL) proof nets into infinite sums of
differential nets. In order to simulate one cut elimination step in MELL, it is
necessary to reduce an arbitrary number of cuts in the differential nets of its
Taylor expansion. It turns out our results apply to differential nets, because
their cut elimination is essentially multiplicative. We moreover show that the
set of differential nets that occur in the Taylor expansion of an MELL net
automatically satisfies our constraints.
  Interestingly, our nets are untyped: we only rely on the sequentiality of
linear logic nets and the dynamics of cut elimination. The paths on which we
impose bounds are the switching paths involved in the Danos--Regnier criterion
for sequentiality. In order to accommodate multiplicative units and weakenings,
our nets come equipped with jumps: each weakening node is connected to some
other node. Our constraint can then be summed up as a bound on both the length
of switching paths, and the number of weakenings that jump to a common node.

intelligently engineered neural-based models, especially those injecting
categorical metadata as additional information, e.g., using user/product

modify parts of the model (e.g., word embeddings, attention mechanisms) such
that results can be customized according to the metadata. We observe that
current representation methods for categorical metadata, which are devised for
human consumption, are not as effective as claimed in popular classification
methods, outperformed even by simple concatenation of categorical features in
the final layer of the sentence encoder. We conjecture that categorical
features are harder to represent for machine use, as available context only
indirectly describes the category, and even such context is often scarce (for
tail category). To this end, we propose to use basis vectors to effectively
incorporate categorical metadata on various parts of a neural-based model. This
additionally decreases the number of parameters dramatically, especially when
the number of categorical features is large. Extensive experiments on various
datasets with different properties are performed and show that through our
method, we can represent categorical metadata more effectively to customize
parts of the model, including unexplored ones, and increase the performance of
the model greatly.

conditioning of linear time-delayed models of non-linear dynamics on an
attractor. While this approach has been well-studied in the asymptotic sense
(e.g. for infinite number of delays), the non-asymptotic setting is not
well-understood. First, we show that the minimal time-delays required for
perfect signal recovery are solely determined by the sparsity in the Fourier
spectrum for scalar systems. For the vector case, we provide a rank test and a
geometric interpretation for the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of an accurate linear time delayed model. Further, we prove that the
output controllability index of a linear system induced by the Fourier spectrum
serves as a tight upper bound on the minimal number of time delays required. An
explicit expression for the exact linear model in the spectral domain is also
provided. From a numerical perspective, the effect of the sampling rate and the
number of time delays on numerical conditioning is examined. An upper bound on
the condition number is derived, with the implication that conditioning can be
improved with additional time delays and/or decreasing sampling rates.
Moreover, it is explicitly shown that the underlying dynamics can be accurately
recovered using only a partial period of the attractor. Our analysis is first
validated in simple periodic and quasi-periodic systems, and sensitivity to
noise is also investigated. Finally, issues and practical strategies of
choosing time delays in large-scale chaotic systems are discussed and
demonstrated on 3D turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection.

engineering and computational sciences. The stochasticity arises as a
consequence of uncertainty in input parameters, constitutive relations,
initial/boundary conditions, etc. Because of these functional uncertainties,
the stochastic parameter space is often high-dimensional, requiring hundreds,
or even thousands, of parameters to describe it. This poses an insurmountable
challenge to response surface modeling since the number of forward model
evaluations needed to construct an accurate surrogate grows exponentially with
the dimension of the uncertain parameter space; a phenomenon referred to as the
\textit{curse of dimensionality}. State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional
uncertainty propagation seek to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by
performing dimensionality reduction in the uncertain parameter space. However,
one still needs to perform forward model evaluations that potentially carry a
very high computational burden. We propose a novel methodology for
high-dimensional uncertainty propagation of elliptic SPDEs which lifts the
requirement for a deterministic forward solver. Our approach is as follows. We
parameterize the solution of the elliptic SPDE using a deep residual network
(ResNet). In a departure from the traditional squared residual (SR) based loss
function for training the ResNet, we introduce a novel physics-informed loss
function derived from variational principles. Specifically, our loss function
is the expectation of the energy functional of the PDE over the stochastic
variables. We demonstrate our solver-free approach through various examples
where the elliptic SPDE is subjected to different types of high-dimensional
input uncertainties. Also, we solve high-dimensional uncertainty propagation
and inverse problems.

accreted by the NS. To match the observed FRB rate, the debris belt would have
to be at least three orders of magnitude more dense than the Kuiper belt. We
also consider the rate of collisions on to the central object but find that the
density of the debris belt must be at least four orders of magnitude more dense

introduces a Kuiper-belt like comet belt rather than an asteroid belt and

kicks; and (3) the NS orbit is coplanar to the debris belt, which provides the

quite important for such safety-critical applications. But since PLC code does
not include an analytic model of the system plant, their verification is
limited to discrete properties. In this paper, we, thus, start the other way
around with hybrid programs that include continuous plant models in addition to
discrete control algorithms. Even deep correctness properties of hybrid
programs can be formally verified in the theorem prover KeYmaera X that
implements differential dynamic logic, dL, for hybrid programs. After verifying
the hybrid program, we now present an approach for translating hybrid programs
into PLC code. The new tool, HyPLC, implements this translation of discrete
control code of verified hybrid program models to PLC controller code and, vice
versa, the translation of existing PLC code into the discrete control actions
for a hybrid program given an additional input of the continuous dynamics of
the system to be verified. This approach allows for the generation of real
controller code while preserving, by compilation, the correctness of a valid
and verified hybrid program. PLCs are common cyber-physical interfaces for
safety-critical industrial control applications, and HyPLC serves as a
pragmatic tool for bridging formal verification of complex cyber-physical
systems at the algorithmic level of hybrid programs with the execution layer of
concrete PLC implementations.

argued; however, the interrelations between neuroscience and the built
environment, and the degree to which the built environment contributes to
increased human restorativeness has not been completely understood yet.
Understanding the interrelations between neuroscience and the built environment
is critical as 90% of time in a typical day is spent indoors and architectural
features impact the productivity, health and comfort of occupants. The goal of
this study is to bring a structured understanding of architecture and
neuroscience interactions in designed facilities and quantification of the
impact of design on human experience. The authors first built two virtual
environments (i.e., restorative and non-restorative) using the architectural
designs features related to human restorativeness identified by previous
research efforts. Next, user experiments were conducted in the two built
virtual environments including 22 people. The subjects were asked to conduct
navigational tasks while their bodily responses recorded by body area sensors
(e.g., EEG, GSR, and Eye-tracking). The result showed that human responses in
restorative and non-restorative environment had statistically significant
difference. This study serves as the first step of understanding human
responses in the virtual environment, and designing spaces that maximize human
experience.

degrees of freedom called scalaron is identified as inflaton. Scalaron linearly
couples to matter via the trace of energy-momentum tensor. We study scenarios
with a sequestered matter sector, where the trace of energy-momentum tensor
predominantly determines the scalaron coupling to matter. In a sequestered
setup, heavy degrees of freedom are expected to decouple from low-energy
dynamics. On the other hand, it is non-trivial to see the decoupling since
scalaron couples to a mass term of heavy degrees of freedom. Actually, when
heavy degrees of freedom carry some gauge charge, the amplitude of scalaron
decay to two gauge bosons does not vanish in the heavy mass limit. Here the
quantum contribution to the trace of energy-momentum tensor plays an essential
role. This quantum contribution is known as trace anomaly or Weyl anomaly. The
trace anomaly contribution from heavy degrees of freedom cancels with the
contribution from the ${\it classical}$ scalaron coupling to a mass term of
heavy degrees of freedom. We see how trace anomaly appears both in the Fujikawa
method and in dimensional renormalization. In dimensional renormalization, one
can evaluate the scalaron decay amplitude in principle at all orders, while it
is unclear how to process it beyond the one-loop level in the Fujikawa method.
We consider scalaron decay to two gauge bosons via the trace of energy-momentum
tensor in quantum electrodynamics with scalars and fermions. We evaluate the
decay amplitude at the leading order to demonstrate the decoupling of heavy
degrees of freedom.

represented by the transformed form $\mathcal{P}_0\left(\varphi_p(t)\right)$ of
the survival probability at rest $\mathcal{P}_0(t)$. The transformation of the
intermediate times, which is induced by the change of reference frame, is
obtained by evaluating the function $\varphi_p(t)$. Under determined
conditions, this function grows linearly and the survival probability
transforms, approximately, according to a scaling law over an estimated time

consults auxiliary classifier when it is uncertain. Based on the source of the

framework of reinforcement learning, the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), in the
context of infinite-horizon discounted cost Markov Decision Process (MDP).
While MCTS is believed to provide an approximate value function for a given
state with enough simulations, the claimed proof in the seminal works is
incomplete. This is due to the fact that the variant, the Upper Confidence
Bound for Trees (UCT), analyzed in prior works utilizes ""logarithmic"" bonus
term for balancing exploration and exploitation within the tree-based search,
following the insights from stochastic multi-arm bandit (MAB) literature. In
effect, such an approach assumes that the regret of the underlying recursively
dependent non-stationary MABs concentrates around their mean exponentially in
the number of steps, which is unlikely to hold as pointed out in literature,
even for stationary MABs. As the key contribution of this work, we establish
polynomial concentration property of regret for a class of non-stationary MAB.
This in turn establishes that the MCTS with appropriate polynomial rather than
logarithmic bonus term in UCB has the claimed property. Using this as a
building block, we argue that MCTS, combined with nearest neighbor supervised
learning, acts as a ""policy improvement"" operator: it iteratively improves
value function approximation for all states, due to combining with supervised
learning, despite evaluating at only finitely many states. In effect, we
establish that to learn an $\varepsilon$ approximation of the value function
with respect to $\ell_\infty$ norm, MCTS combined with nearest neighbor
requires a sample size scaling as
$\widetilde{O}\big(\varepsilon^{-(d+4)}\big)$, where $d$ is the dimension of
the state space. This is nearly optimal due to a minimax lower bound of
$\widetilde{\Omega}\big(\varepsilon^{-(d+2)}\big)$.

Like equilibrium free energies, relative rate constants can be estimated by
importance sampling. An extension to transition path sampling is proposed that

this estimate. We show that rate constants can also be decomposed into
different contributions, including relative changes in stability, barrier
height and flux. This decomposition provides a means of interpretation and
insight into rare processes in complex environments. We verify these ideas with
a simple model of diffusion with spatially varying diffusivity and illustrate

transmission spectra that show an upward slope towards shorter wavelengths and
weak molecular features. While previous studies have only considered spherical
haze particles, photochemical hazes composed of hydrocarbon aggregate particles
are common throughout the solar system. We use an aerosol microphysics model to
investigate the effect of aggregate photochemical haze particles on
transmission spectra of warm exoplanets. We find that the wavelength dependence
of the optical depth of aggregate particle hazes is flatter than for spheres
since aggregates grow to larger radii. As a result, while spherical haze
opacity displays a scattering slope towards shorter wavelengths, aggregate haze
opacity can be gray in the optical and NIR, similar to those assumed for
condensate cloud decks. We further find that haze opacity increases with
increasing production rate, decreasing eddy diffusivity, and increasing monomer
size, though the magnitude of the latter effect is dependent on production rate
and the atmospheric pressure levels probed. We generate synthetic exoplanet
transmission spectra to investigate the effect of these hazes on spectral
features. For high haze opacity cases, aggregate hazes lead to flat, nearly
featureless spectra, while spherical hazes produce sloped spectra with clear
spectral features at long wavelengths. Finally, we generate synthetic
transmission spectra of GJ 1214b for aggregate and spherical hazes and compare
them to space-based observations. We find that aggregate hazes can reproduce
the data significantly better than spherical hazes, assuming a production rate
limited by delivery of methane to the upper atmosphere.

consists of a head particle and a spherical phantom region of fluid where the
flagellum of a microswimmer takes effect. The orientation of the active
particle is governed by a stochastic dynamics, with the orientational
persistence time determined by the rotational diffusivity. To hydrodynamically
drive the active particle as a pusher, a pair of active forces are exerted on
the head particle and the phantom fluid region respectively. The active
velocity measured along the particle orientation is proportional to the
magnitude of the active force. The effective diffusion coefficient of the
active particle is first measured in free space, showing semi-quantitative
agreement with the analytical result predicted by a minimal model for ABPs. We
then turn to the probability distribution of the active particle in confinement
potential. We find that the stationary particle distribution undergoes an
evolution from the Boltzmann-type to non-Boltzmann distribution as the
orientational persistence time is increased relative to the relaxation time in
the potential well. From the stationary distribution in confinement potential,
the active part of the diffusion coefficient is measured and compared to that
obtained in free space, showing a good semi-quantitative agreement while the
orientational persistence time varies greatly relative to the relaxation time.

small upflow velocities ranging from (-1 to +1) km/s in the Mg\,{\sc ii} k line

velocities from (-10 to -20) km/s in Si\,{\sc iv}. Thus, the transition of the

always remains red-shifted indicating downflowing plasma. The multi-spectral
line analysis in the present paper provides a detailed scenario of the plasma
flows inversions in cool loop systems leading to the mass transport and their

the form of well known Aubry-Andr\'{e} or Harper (AAH) model, a classic example

moment which is responsible for spin separation, and, in presence of finite
bias an electric field is generated along the chain which essentially makes the
asymmetric band structures under forward and reverse biased conditions,
yielding finite rectification. Rectification is observed in two forms: (i)
positive and (ii) negative, depending on the sign of currents in two bias
polarities. These two forms can only be observed in the case of spin current
rectification, while charge current shows conventional rectification operation.
Moreover, we discuss how rectification ratio and especially its direction can

([Fe/H] $<$ -1.5) outer stellar halo (d $>$ 15 kpc) of the Milky Way using data
from Gaia, LAMOST and SDSS. Our method is built using an unsupervised learning
algorithm, a self-organizing map, which trains a 2-D neural network to learn
the topological structures of a data set from an n-D input space. Using a 4-D
space of angular momentum and orbital energy, we identify three distinct groups
corresponding to the Sagittarius, Orphan, and Cetus Streams. For the first time
we are able to discover a northern counterpart to the Cetus stream. We test the
robustness of this new detection using mock data and find that the significance
is more than 5-sigma. We also find that the existing southern counterpart
bifurcates into two clumps with different radial velocities. By exploiting the
visualization power of StarGO, we attach MW globular clusters to the same
trained neural network. The Sagittarius stream is found to have five related
clusters, confirming recent literature studies, and the Cetus stream has one
associated cluster, NGC 5824. This latter association has previously been
postulated, but can only now be truly confirmed thanks to the high-precision
Gaia proper motions and large numbers of stellar spectra from LAMOST. The large
metallicity dispersion of the stream indicates that the progenitor cannot be a
globular cluster. Given the mean metallicity of the stream, we propose that the
stream is the result of a merger of a low-mass dwarf galaxy that hosted a large
nuclear star cluster (NGC 5824).

an interface in a homogeneous turbulent shear flow at a shear Reynolds number
equal to 15200. The viscosity and density of the two fluids are equal, and
various surface tensions and initial droplet diameters are considered in the
present study. We show that the two-phase flow reaches a statistically
stationary turbulent state sustained by a non-zero mean turbulent production
rate due to the presence of the mean shear. Compared to single-phase flow, we
find that the resulting steady state conditions exhibit reduced Taylor
microscale Reynolds numbers owing to the presence of the dispersed phase, which
acts as a sink of turbulent kinetic energy for the carrier fluid. At steady
state, the mean power of surface tension is zero and the turbulent production
rate is in balance with the turbulent dissipation rate, with their values being
larger than in the reference single-phase case. The interface modifies the
energy spectrum by introducing energy at small-scales, with the difference from
the single-phase case reducing as the Weber number increases. This is caused by
both the number of droplets in the domain and the total surface area increasing
monotonically with the Weber number. This reflects also in the droplets size
distribution which changes with the Weber number, with the peak of the
distribution moving to smaller sizes as the Weber number increases. We show
that the Hinze estimate for the maximum droplet size, obtained considering
breakup in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, provides an excellent estimate
notwithstanding the action of significant coalescence and the presence of a
mean shear.

challenge of blockchain. Participants directly make payments through a network
of payment channels without the overhead of committing onchain transactions.
Routing is critical to the performance of offchain networks. Existing solutions
use either static routing with poor performance or dynamic routing with high
overhead to obtain the dynamic channel balance information. In this paper, we
propose Flash, a new dynamic routing solution that leverages the unique
characteristics of transactions in offchain networks to strike a better
tradeoff between path optimality and probing overhead. By studying the traces
of real offchain networks, we find that the payment sizes are heavy-tailed, and
most payments are highly recurrent. Flash thus differentiates the treatment of
elephant payments from mice payments. It uses a modified max-flow algorithm for
elephant payments to find paths with sufficient capacity, and strategically
routes the payment across paths to minimize the transaction fees. Mice payments
are directly sent by looking up a routing table with a few precomputed paths to
reduce probing overhead. Testbed experiments and data-driven simulations show
that Flash improves the success volume of payments by up to 2.3x compared to
the state-of-the-art routing algorithm.

analyzing the microscopic origin of ultrafast dynamics induced by localized
optical excitation in metal-insulator heterostructures. Using [Fe/MgO]$_n$ as a
model system, we perform ultraviolet pump/soft X-ray probe experiments, which
are sensitive to all constituents of these heterostructures, to probe both
electronic and lattice excitations. Complementary ultrafast electron
diffraction experiments independently analyze the lattice dynamics of the Fe
constituent, and together with ab initio calculations yield comprehensive
insight into the microscopic processes leading to local relaxation within a
single constituent or non-local relaxation between two constituents. Besides
electronic excitations in Fe, which are monitored at the Fe L$_3$ absorption
edge and relax within 1 ps by electron-phonon coupling, soft X-ray analysis
identifies a change at the oxygen K absorption edge of the MgO layers which
occurs within 0.5 ps. This ultrafast energy transfer across the Fe-MgO
interface is mediated by high-frequency, interface vibrational modes, which are
excited by hot electrons in Fe and couple to vibrations in MgO in a
mode-selective, non-thermal manner. A second, slower timescale is identified at
the oxygen K pre-edge and the Fe L$_3$ edge. The slower process represents
energy transfer by acoustic phonons and contributes to thermalization of the
entire heterostructure. We thus find that the interfacial energy transfer is
associated with non-equilibrium behavior in the phonon system. Because our
experiments lack signatures of charge transfer across the interface, we
conclude that phonon-mediated processes dominate the competition of electronic
and lattice excitations in these non-local, non-equilibrium dynamics.

tile, while the uniformity of the tile response turned out to be very good.
Then, a detection layer composed of 144 tiles of $60\times60~\mathrm{mm^2}$ was
constructed. The detection layer was added to the large technological prototype
of AHCAL composed of 38 detection layers with $30\times30~\mathrm{mm^2}$ tiles.
The detection layer was successfully tested in test beam experiments at CERN

potential of the Galaxy, and hence of its dark matter distribution. In
particular, the shape of the dark halo (e.g. spherical, oblate, or prolate)
determines velocity correlations, and different halo geometries are expected to
result in measurable differences. Here we explore and interpret the
correlations in the $(v_R, v_z)$-velocity distribution as a function of
position in the Milky Way. We selected a high-quality sample of stars from the
Gaia DR2 catalogue and characterised the orientation of the velocity
distribution or tilt angle over a radial distance range of $[4-13]~$kpc and up
to $3.5~$kpc away from the Galactic plane while taking into account the effects
of the measurement errors. We find that the tilt angles change from spherical
alignment in the inner Galaxy ($R\sim4~$kpc) towards more cylindrical
alignments in the outer Galaxy ($R\sim11~$kpc) when using distances that take a
global zero-point offset in the parallax of $-29~\mu$as. However, if the
amplitude of this offset is underestimated, then the inferred tilt angles in
the outer Galaxy only appear shallower and are intrinsically more consistent
with spherical alignment for an offset as large as $-54~\mu$as. We further find
that the tilt angles do not seem to strongly vary with Galactic azimuth and
that different stellar populations depict similar tilt angles. Therefore we
introduce a simple analytic function that describes the trends found over the
full radial range. Since the systematic parallax errors in Gaia DR2 depend on
celestial position, magnitude, and colour in complex ways, it is not possible
to fully correct for them. Therefore it will be particularly important for
dynamical modelling of the Milky Way to thoroughly characterise the systematics
in astrometry in future Gaia data releases.

calculating the first variation to the total surface energy functional. The
speed method shares more advantages than the traditional use of parameterized

(related with Cahn-Hoffman $\boldsymbol{\xi}$-vector) is clearer and more
direct. By making use of the first variation, necessary conditions for the
equilibrium shape of the solid-state dewetting problem is given, and a kinetic
sharp-interface model which includes the surface energy anisotropy is also
proposed. This sharp-interface model describes the interface evolution in 3D

the proposed model, we perform lots of numerical simulations to investigate the
evolution of patterned films, e.g., the evolution of a short cuboid and
pinch-off of a long cuboid. Numerical simulations in 3D demonstrate the
accuracy and efficacy of the sharp-interface approach to capture many of the

code called galaxy Support Vector Machine (galSVM) and HST/ACS data as well as
WFP2 master catalogue to automatically classify all cluster members up to 1
Mpc. galSVM analyses galaxy morphologies through Support Vector Machine (SVM).
From the 231 cluster galaxies, we classified 97 as early-types (ET) and 83 as
late-types (LT). The remaining 51 stayed unclassified (or undecided, UD). By
cross-matching our results with the existing visual classification, we found an

classifications, 121 of our galaxies were classified for the first time in this
work. In addition, we tested the location of classified galaxies on the
standard morphological diagrams, colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams.
Out of all cluster members, $\sim$20% are emission line galaxies (ELG), taking
into account previous GLACE results. We have verified that the ET fraction is
slightly higher near the cluster core and decreases with the clustercentric
distance, while the opposite trend has been observed for LT galaxies. We found
higher fraction of ET (54%) than LT (46%) throughout the analysed central
region, as expected. In addition, we analysed the correlation between the five
morphological parameters (Abraham concentration, Bershady-Concelice
concentration, Asymmetry, Gini and M20 moment of light) and clustercentric
distance, without finding a clear trend. Finally, as a result of our work, the

from hybrid functional calculations show that intermediate bands (IB) are
formed in Ti4+ substituted MgH2 which could improve the solar cell efficiencies
due to multiple photon absorption from valence band to conduction band via IBs

ago. More recently emerged the interest of ice as a model material to study
some fundamental aspects of crystalline plasticity. An example is the nature of
plastic fluctuations and collective dislocation dynamics. 20 years ago,
acoustic emission measurements performed during the deformation of ice single
crystals revealed that plastic flow proceeds through intermittent dislocation
avalanches, power law distributed in size and energy. This means that most of
ice plasticity takes place through few, very large avalanches, thus qualifying
associated plastic fluctuations as wild. This launched an intense research
activity on plastic intermittency in the Material Science community. The
interest of ice in this debate is reviewed, from a comparison with other
crystalline materials. In this context, ice appears as an extreme case of
plastic intermittency, characterized by scale-free fluctuations, complex space
and time correlations as well as avalanche triggering. In other words, ice can
be considered as the paradigm of wild plasticity.

overcomes the hyperparameter setting problem occurred during the training phase

of generating accurate detection results using small-size input images, leading
to improvement of computational efficiency for real-time autonomous driving

predict, on the basis of various recorded solar activity indices, the complete
evolution of future solar cycles, due to highly complex dynamical and
stochastic processes involved, mainly related to interaction of different
components of internal magnetic fields. There are two main distinct classes of
solar cycle prediction methods: the precursor-like ones and the

non-precursor methods use different mathematical and/or numerical properties of
the known temporal evolution of solar activity indices to extract useful

with angular resolution of 2'' x 1.6'' (linear resolution 270 au x 216 au).
Within the primary beam, a compact region of 0.1 Msun, which we call a
""kernel"", has been unveiled. The kernel is elongated, with a central flat zone
with radius Rker ~ 10'' (~ 1400 au). The average number density within Rker is
~1 x 10^6 cm^{-3}, with possible local density enhancements. The region within
Rker appears to have fragmented, but detailed analysis shows that similar
substructure can be reproduced by synthetic interferometric observations of a
smooth centrally concentrated dense core with a similar central flat zone. The
presence of a smooth kernel within a dense core is in agreement with non-ideal
magneto-hydro-dynamical simulations of a contracting cloud core with a peak
number density of 1 x 10^7 cm^{-3}. Dense cores with lower central densities
are completely filtered out when simulated 12m-array observations are carried
out. These observations demonstrate that the kernel of dynamically evolved

periodic processes. Importantly, their functionality depends on the emerging
collective dynamics of the network. Synchrony of oscillations is one of the
most prominent examples of such collective behavior and has been associated
both with function and dysfunction. Understanding how network structure and
interactions, as well as the microscopic properties of individual units, shape
the emerging collective dynamics is critical to find factors that lead to
malfunction. However, many biological systems such as the brain consist of a
large number of dynamical units. Hence, their analysis has either relied on
simplified heuristic models on a coarse scale, or the analysis comes at a huge
computational cost. Here we review recently introduced approaches, known as the
Ott-Antonsen and Watanabe-Strogatz reductions, allowing one to simplify the
analysis by bridging small and large scales. Thus, reduced model equations are
obtained that exactly describe the collective dynamics for each subpopulation
in the oscillator network via few collective variables only. The resulting
equations are next-generation models: Rather than being heuristic, they exactly
link microscopic and macroscopic descriptions and therefore accurately capture
microscopic properties of the underlying system. At the same time, they are
sufficiently simple to analyze without great computational effort. In the last
decade, these reduction methods have become instrumental in understanding how
network structure and interactions shape the collective dynamics and the
emergence of synchrony. We review this progress based on concrete examples and
outline possible limitations. Finally, we discuss how linking the reduced

momentum and internal degrees of freedom such as spin implicit in the band

effective field and the resultant Berry phase has greatly advanced our
understanding of diverse phenomena including various Hall effects and has lead
to the discovery of new states of matter exemplified by topological insulators.
While experimental studies on topological systems have focused on the gapless
states that emerge at the surfaces or edges, the underlying nontrivial topology
in the bulk has not been manifested. Here we report the observation of Berry's
phase in magneto-oscillations and quantum Hall effects of a coupled
electron-hole system hosted in quantum wells with inverted bands. In contrast
to massless Dirac fermions in graphene, for which the Berry phase $\Gamma$ is
quantized at $\pi$, we observe that $\Gamma$ varies with the Fermi level
$E_\mathrm{F}$, passing through $\pi$ as $E_\mathrm{F}$ traverses the energy
gap that opens due to electron-hole hybridization. We show that the evolution
of $\Gamma$ is a manifestation of the pseudospin texture that encodes the
momentum-dependent electron-hole coupling and is therefore a bulk signature of
the nontrivial band topology.

concurrency is to manually introduce explicit concurrency constructs such as
multi-threading. In multi-threaded programs, managing synchronization between
threads is a complicated and challenging task for the programmers due to thread
interleaving and heap interference that leads to problems such as deadlocks,
data races. With these considerations in mind, access permission-based
dependencies have been investigated as an alternative approach to verify the
correctness of multi-threaded programs and to exploit the implicit concurrency
present in sequential programs without using explicit concurrency constraints.
However, significant annotation overhead can arise from manually adding
permission-based specifications in a source program, diminishing the
effectiveness of existing permission-based approaches. In this paper,we present
a framework, Sip4J, to automatically extract access permission-based implicit

static analysis of the source code. Moreover, we integrate and extend an
existing permission-based verification tool, Pulse, to automatically verify

obtain a split of the energy cascade in which one fraction of the input goes to
small scales generating the three-dimensional direct cascade. The remaining
energy flows to large scales producing the inverse cascade which eventually
causes the formation of a quasi two-dimensional condensed state at the largest
horizontal scale. Our results shows that the connection between the two actors
of the split energy cascade in thin layers is tighter than what was established
before: the small scale three-dimensional turbulence acts as an effective
viscosity and dissipates the large-scale energy thus providing a
viscosity-independent mechanism for arresting the growth of the condensate.
This scenario is supported by quantitative predictions of the saturation energy

many CNN-based image quality assessment (IQA) models have been studied.
However, previous CNN-based IQA models likely have yet to utilize the
characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) fully for IQA problems when
they simply entrust everything to the CNN, expecting it to learn from a
training dataset. However, in this paper, we propose a novel saliency-channel
attention residual network based on the just-noticeable-difference (JND)
concept for full-reference image quality assessments (FR-IQA). It is referred
to as JND-SalCAR and shows significant improvements in large IQA datasets with
various types of distortion. The proposed JND-SalCAR effectively learns how to
incorporate human psychophysical characteristics, such as visual saliency and
JND, into image quality predictions. In the proposed network, a SalCAR block is
devised so that perceptually important features can be extracted with the help
of saliency-based spatial attention and channel attention schemes. In addition,
a saliency map serves as a guideline for predicting a patch weight map in order
to afford stable training of end-to-end optimization for the JND-SalCAR. To the
best of our knowledge, our work presents the first HVS-inspired trainable
FR-IQA network that considers both visual saliency and the JND characteristics
of the HVS. When the visual saliency map and the JND probability map are
explicitly given as priors, they can be usefully combined to predict IQA scores
rated by humans more precisely, eventually leading to performance improvements
and faster convergence. The experimental results show that the proposed
JND-SalCAR significantly outperforms all recent state-of-the-art FR-IQA methods
on large IQA datasets in terms of the Spearman rank order coefficient (SRCC)
and the Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC).

this phenomenon, with over 50 cluster members detected in historical X-ray
observations. In the decade since these data were obtained, significant new
multi-epoch observations of the cluster have been made, allowing a fundamental
reappraisal of the nature of both X-ray bright and dark stars. A total of 45
X-ray sources within Wd1 now have precise spectral classifications. These
observations identify 16 candidate and confirmed massive binaries; by
comparison 22 stars have X-ray properties that imply a contribution from a wind
collision zone. X-ray emission appears confined to O9-B0.5 supergiants,
Wolf-Rayets and a small group of highly luminous interacting/post-interaction
binaries. Despite their presence in large numbers, no emission is seen from
earlier, less evolved O stars or later, cooler B super-/hypergiants. We suppose
that the lack of X-ray emission from O giants is due to their comparatively low
bolometric luminosities if, as expected, they follow the canonical L_X/L_bol
relation for hot stars. The transition away from X-ray emission for OB
supergiants occurs at the location of the bistability jump; we speculate that
below this limit, stellar wind velocities are insufficient for internal, X-ray
emitting shocks to form. Our results are consistent with recent findings that
massive binaries are not uniformly brighter than single stars of comparable
luminosity and spectral type, although it is noteworthy that the brightest and
hardest stellar X-ray sources within Wd1 are all either confirmed or candidate
massive, interacting/post-interaction binaries (Abridged).

  error rates",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Experimental treatments pass through various stages of
development. If a treatment passes through early phase experiments, the
investigators may want to assess it in a late phase randomised controlled
trial. An efficient way to do this is adding it as a new research arm to an
ongoing trial. This allows to add the new treatment while the existing arms
continue. The familywise type I error rate (FWER) is often a key quantity of
interest in any multi-arm trial. We set out to clarify how it should be
calculated when new arms are added to a trial some time after it has started.
  Methods: We show how the FWER, any-pair and all-pairs powers can be
calculated when a new arm is added to a platform trial. We extend the Dunnett
probability and derive analytical formulae for the correlation between the test
statistics of the existing pairwise comparison and that of the newly added arm.
We also verify our analytical derivation via simulations.
  Results: Our results indicate that the FWER depends on the shared control arm
information (i.e. individuals in continuous and binary outcomes and primary
outcome events in time-to-event outcomes) from the common control arm patients
and the allocation ratio. The FWER is driven more by the number of pairwise
comparisons and the corresponding (pairwise) Type I error rates than by the
timing of the addition of the new arms. The FWER can be estimated using
\v{S}id\'{a}k's correction if the correlation between the test statistics of
pairwise comparisons is less than 0:30.
  Conclusions: The findings we present in this article can be used to design
trials with pre-planned deferred arms or to design new pairwise comparisons
within an ongoing platform trial where control of the pairwise error rate
(PWER) or FWER (for a subset of pairwise comparisons) is required.

mimics GW effects. This GGN is expected to become dominant in the infrasound
domain and must be tackled for the future realization of observatories
exploring GWs at low frequency. GGN will be studied with the MIGA experiment, a
demonstrator for low frequency GW detection based on atom interferometry - now
in construction at the low noise underground laboratory LSBB in France. MIGA
will provide precise measurements of local gravity, probed by a network of
three free-falling atom test masses separated up to 150~m. We model the effect
of GGN for MIGA and use seismic and atmospheric data recorded at LSBB to
characterize their impact on the future measurements. We show that the antenna

proposed image capturing device contacts the surface of the phantom, and
surface deformation will occur due to applied force at the time of scanning. A
novel force based surface rectification system is used to reconstruct a

full surface from rectified images, advanced affine scale-invariant feature
transform (A-SIFT) is proposed to reduce the affine effect in time when data
capturing. Camera position based image stitching approach is applied to
construct the final original non-rigid surface. The proposed model is validated
in theoretical models and real scenarios, to demonstrate its advantages with

equipped with a compliant element has contributed not only to advances in human
interacting robots but also to a wide range of improvements in the robotics
area. Nevertheless, there are still limitations in its performance; the elastic
spring that is adopted to provide compliance is considered to limit the
actuator performance thus lowering the frequency bandwidth of force/torque
generation, and the bandwidth decreases even more when it is supposed to
provide large torque.
  This weakness is in turn owing to the limitations of motor and motor drives
such as torque and velocity limits. In this paper, mathematical tools to
analyze the impact of these limitations on the performance of SEA as a
transmission system are provided. A novel criterion called Maximum Torque
Transmissibility (MTT)is defined to assess the ability of SEA to fully utilize
maximum continuous motor torque. Moreover, an original frequency bandwidth
concept, maximum torque frequency bandwidth, which can indicate the maximum
frequency up to which the SEA can generate the maximum torque, is proposed
based on the proposed MTT. The proposed MTT can be utilized as a unique
criterion of the performance, and thus various design parameters including the
load condition, mechanical design parameters, and controller parameters of a
SEA can be evaluated with its use. Experimental results under various
conditions verify that MTT can precisely indicate the limitation of the
performance of SEA, and that it can be utilized to accurately analyze the

known as $f$-divergences or the Csisz\'ar--Morimoto divergences. These Lyapunov
functions are universal in the following sense: they depend only on the state

  Despite many years of research, no such wide family of universal Lyapunov
functions has been found for nonlinear reaction networks. For general
non-linear networks with detailed or complex balance, the classical
thermodynamics potentials remain the only universal Lyapunov functions.
  We constructed a rich family of new universal Lyapunov functions for {\em any

are parameterised by compact subsets of the projective space. They are
universal in the same sense: they depend only on the state of equilibrium and

spherically symmetric radiation-hydrodynamical code DARWIN. To explore the
metallicity-dependence of mass loss we calculate model grids at three different
chemical abundances. Since carbon may be dredged up during the thermal pulses
as AGB stars evolve, we keep the carbon abundance as a free parameter. The
models in these three different grids all have a current mass of one solar
mass; effective temperatures of 2600K, 2800K, 3000K, or 3200K; and stellar
luminosities equal to log(L/Lsun)=3.70, 3.85, or 4.00.
  The models show that mass loss in carbon stars is facilitated by high
luminosities, low effective temperatures, and a high carbon excess (C-O) at
both solar and subsolar metallicities. Similar combinations of effective
temperature, luminosity, and carbon excess produce outflows at both solar and
subsolar metallicities. There are no large systematic differences in the
mass-loss rates and wind velocities produced by these wind models with respect
to metallicity, nor any systematic difference concerning the distribution of
grain sizes or how much carbon is condensed into dust. DARWIN models at
subsolar metallicity have approximately 15% lower mass-loss rates compared to
DARWIN models at solar metallicity with the same stellar parameters and carbon
excess. For both solar and subsolar environments typical grain sizes range
between 0.1 and 0.5 micron, the degree of condensed carbon varies between 5%
and 40%, and the gas-to-dust ratios between 500 and 10000. Furthermore, stellar
evolution models can use the mass-loss rates calculated from DARWIN models at
solar metallicity when modeling the AGB phase at subsolar metallicities if
carbon excess is used as the critical abundance parameter instead of the C/O
ratio.

(SAT)-based attacks that can potentially decrypt obfuscated circuits, called
deobfuscation. Deobfuscation runtime could have a large span ranging from few
milliseconds to thousands of years or more, depending on the number and layouts

the first machine-learning framework that predicts the deobfuscation runtime

underlying the algorithm, termed SBL-DF, is the incorporation of a signal
prediction generated from a dynamics model and estimates of previous time steps
into the hyperpriors of the SBL probability model. The proposed algorithm is
robust to imperfect dynamics models (due to the propagation of dynamics
information through higher-order statistics), robust to certain undesirable
dictionary properties such as coherence (due to properties of the SBL
framework), allows the use of arbitrary dynamics models, and requires the
tuning of fewer parameters than many other dynamic filtering algorithms do. We
also extend the fast marginal likelihood SBL inference procedure to the
informative hyperprior setting to create a particularly efficient version of
the SBL-DF algorithm. Numerical simulations show that SBL-DF converges much
faster and to more accurate solutions than standard SBL and other dynamical
filtering algorithms. In particular, we show that SBL-DF outperforms state of
the art algorithms when the dictionary contains challenging structure such as
coherence and column scaling, as is found in many practical applications.

for ETI (OSETI) has looked for enhanced brightness in the form of either
narrow-band spectral emission or time correlated photons from laser pulses. In
this paper it is proposed to look for coherence properties of incoming light in
a manner that can distinguish against atomic emission lines. The use of photon
sensitive detectors and a modulating asymmetric interferometer has been
modelled. The results suggest that the sensitivity of detection for continuous
laser sources would be better than current spectroscopic approaches, with
detection thresholds of $<$1 photon s$^{-1}$m$^{-2}$ against a background with
a spectral bandwidth of 0.1nm over an observation time of 750s.

counters for high-energy-physics experiments because of their optical
transparency and intermediate refractive indices between those of gases and
liquids or solids. Cherenkov counters that employ silica aerogels as radiators
and photodetectors are often used to identify subatomic charged particles
(e.g., electrons, protons, and pions) with momenta on the order of sub-GeV/$c$
to GeV/$c$; they are also used to measure particle velocities in
accelerator-based particle- and nuclear-physics experiments and in space- and
balloon-borne experiments in the field of cosmic-ray physics. Recent studies
have demonstrated that it is important for the design of Cherenkov counters
that the transparent silica-aerogel tiles comprise solid material with recently
improved transparency and a refractive index that can be controlled between
1.003 and 1.26 by varying the bulk density in the range of 0.01$-$1.0 g/cm$^3$.
Additionally, a technique for fabricating large-area silica-aerogel tiles
without cracking has been developed. In this chapter, we describe advances in
the technologies for producing silica aerogels with high optical performances
to be used in scientific instruments. We further discuss the principles
underlying the operation of detectors based on the Cherenkov effect. We also
review applications of silica aerogels in specific high-energy-physics
experiments.

planet formation, and is especially relevant to the formation of compact,
resonant terrestrial planetary systems. Pebbles initially form in the inner
protoplanetary disc, sweeping outwards in a radially expanding front,
potentially forming planetesimals and planetary cores via migration and the
streaming instability. This pebble front appears at early times, in what is
typically assumed to be a low mass disc. We argue this picture is in conflict
with the reality of young circumstellar discs, which are massive and
self-gravitating. We apply standard pebble accretion and streaming instability
formulae to self-gravitating protostellar disc models. Fragments will open a
gap in the pebble disc, but they will likely fail to open a gap in the gas, and
continue rapid inward migration. If this does not strongly perturb the pebble
disc, our results show that disc fragments will accrete pebbles efficiently. We
find that in general the pebble-to-gas-density ratio fails to exceed 0.01,
suggesting that the streaming instability will struggle to operate. It may be
possible to activate the instability if 10 cm grains are available, and spiral
structures can effectively concentrate them in regions of low
gravito-turbulence. If this occurs, lunar mass cores might be assembled on
timescales of a few thousand years, **but this is likely to be rare, and is far
from proven**. In any case, this work highlights the need for study of how
self-gravitating protostellar discs define the distribution and properties of
solid bodies, for future planet formation by core accretion.

to be the hyperk\""ahler quotient of $T^*(G/H)\times (G\times S)$ by a maximal

elementary cases (e.g. when $S$ is regular and

optimal among point configurations in Euclidean spaces of dimensions $8$ and
$24$, respectively. In other words, they minimize energy for every potential
function that is a completely monotonic function of squared distance (for
example, inverse power laws or Gaussians), which is a strong form of robustness
not previously known for any configuration in more than one dimension. This
theorem implies their recently shown optimality as sphere packings, and broadly
generalizes it to allow for long-range interactions.
  The proof uses sharp linear programming bounds for energy. To construct the
optimal auxiliary functions used to attain these bounds, we prove a new
interpolation theorem, which is of independent interest. It reconstructs a
radial Schwartz function $f$ from the values and radial derivatives of $f$ and
its Fourier transform $\widehat{f}$ at the radii $\sqrt{2n}$ for integers
$n\ge1$ in $\mathbb{R}^8$ and $n \ge 2$ in $\mathbb{R}^{24}$. To prove this
theorem, we construct an interpolation basis using integral transforms of
quasimodular forms, generalizing Viazovska's work on sphere packing and placing
it in the context of a more conceptual theory.

numerically the banding of emulsions, i.e. the formation of regions of high and
low volume fraction, alternated in the vorticity direction and aligned with the
flow (shear bands). These bands are associated with a decrease of the effective
viscosity of the system. To understand the mechanism of banding experimentally
observed we have performed interface resolved simulations of the two-fluid
system. The experiments were perfomed starting with a random distribution of
droplets which, under the applied shear, evolves in time resulting in a phase
separation. To numerically reproduce this process, the banded structures are
initialized in a narrow channel confined by two walls moving in opposite
direction. We find that the initial banded distribution is stable when droplets
are free to merge and unstable when coalescence is prevented. In this case,
additionally, the effective viscosity of the system increases, resembling the
rheological behavior of suspensions of deformable particles. Droplets
coalescence, on the other hand, allows emulsions to reduce the total surface of
the system and hence the energy dissipation associated to the deformation,
which in turn reduces the effective viscosity.

Here by using computer simulation, we systematically investigate the

parallel hard walls, and we find that the confinement can stabilize multi-layer
NaCl-like (simple cubic) open crystals. The maximal layers of stable NaCl-like
crystal increases with decreasing the inverse screening length. More
interestingly, at finite low temperature, the large vibrational entropy can
stabilize some multi-layer NaCl-like crystals against the most energetically
favoured close-packed crystals. In the parameter range studied, we find upto
4-layer NaCl-like crystal to be stable in confinement. Our photonic calculation
shows that the inverse 4-layer NaCl-like crystal can already reproduce the
large photonic band gaps of the bulk simple cubic crystal, which open at low
frequency range with low dielectric contrast. This suggests new possibilities
of using confined colloidal systems to fabricate open crystalline materials

radiological protection of river water in the vicinity of nuclear power plants.
The European Council Directive 2013/51/Euratom requires that the maximum level
of tritium in water for human consumption to be lower than 100 Bq/L. Tritium
levels in the cooling water of nuclear power plants in normal operation are
much higher than the levels caused by the natural and cosmogenic components,
and may easily surmount the limit required by the Directive. The current
liquid-scintillation measuring systems in environmental radioactivity
laboratories are sensitive to such low levels, but they are not suitable for
real-time monitoring. Moreover, there is no currently available device with
enough sensitivity and monitoring capabilities that could be used for
surveillance of the cooling water of nuclear power plants. A detector system
based on scintillation fibers read out by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) or
silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays is under development for in-water tritium
measurement. This detector will be installed in the vicinity of Almaraz nuclear
power plant (Spain) in Spring 2019. An overview of the project development and

We performed near-infrared imaging and K-band spectroscopy of the massive stars

colour-colour diagrams and compared the properties of the spectroscopically
identified stars with stellar evolution models. We derived the ages of the
different sub-clusters in W51 and, based on our spectroscopy derived an age for

lines of code and references to many external libraries. Redundant operations
are a common performance limiter in these code bases. Missed compiler
optimization opportunities, inappropriate data structure and algorithm choices,
and developers' inattention to performance are some common reasons for the
existence of redundant operations. Developers mainly depend on compilers to
eliminate redundant operations. However, compilers' static analysis often
misses optimization opportunities due to ambiguities and limited analysis
scope; automatic optimizations to algorithmic and data structural problems are
out of scope.
  We develop LoadSpy, a whole-program profiler to pinpoint redundant memory
load operations, which are often a symptom of many redundant operations. The
strength of LoadSpy exists in identifying and quantifying redundant load
operations in programs and associating the redundancies with program execution
contexts and scopes to focus developers' attention on problematic code. LoadSpy
works on fully optimized binaries, adopts various optimization techniques to
reduce its overhead, and provides a rich graphic user interface, which make it
a complete developer tool. Applying LoadSpy showed that a large fraction of
redundant loads is common in modern software packages despite highest levels of
automatic compiler optimizations. Guided by LoadSpy, we optimize several
well-known benchmarks and real-world applications, yielding significant
speedups.

  Entropy and Effective Environment Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new policy iteration theory as an important extension of soft
policy iteration and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), one of the most efficient model
free algorithms for deep reinforcement learning. Supported by the new theory,
arbitrary entropy measures that generalize Shannon entropy, such as Tsallis
entropy and Renyi entropy, can be utilized to properly randomize action
selection while fulfilling the goal of maximizing expected long-term rewards.
Our theory gives birth to two new algorithms, i.e., Tsallis entropy
Actor-Critic (TAC) and Renyi entropy Actor-Critic (RAC). Theoretical analysis
shows that these algorithms can be more effective than SAC. Moreover, they pave
the way for us to develop a new Ensemble Actor-Critic (EAC) algorithm in this
paper that features the use of a bootstrap mechanism for deep environment
exploration as well as a new value-function based mechanism for high-level
action selection. Empirically we show that TAC, RAC and EAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmark control tasks,
outperforming SAC and several cutting-edge learning algorithms in terms of both
sample efficiency and effectiveness.

  Semidefinite Matrix Spaces","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1809.09155",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal in this paper is to develop first-order methods equipped with
convergence rates for multi-agent optimization problems on semidefinite matrix
spaces. These problems include cooperative optimization problems and
non-cooperative Nash games. Accordingly, first we consider a multi-agent system
where the agents cooperatively minimize the summation of their local convex
objectives, and second, we consider Cartesian stochastic variational inequality
(CSVI) problems with monotone mappings for addressing stochastic Nash games on
semidefinite matrix spaces. Despite the recent advancements in first-order
methods addressing problems over vector spaces, there seems to be a major gap
in the theory of the first-order methods for optimization problems and
equilibriums on semidefinite matrix spaces. In particular, to the best of our
knowledge, there exists no method with provable convergence rate for solving
the two classes of problems under mild assumptions. Most existing methods
either rely on strong assumptions, or require a two-loop framework where at
each iteration a semidefinite optimization problem needs to be solved.
Motivated by this gap, in the first part of the paper, we develop a mirror
descent incremental subgradient method for minimizing a finite-sum function. We
show that the iterates generated by the algorithm converge asymptotically to an
optimal solution and derive a non-asymptotic convergence rate. In the second
part, we consider semidefinite CSVI problems. We develop a stochastic mirror
descent method that only requires monotonicity of the mapping. We show that the
iterates generated by the algorithm converge to a solution of the CSVI almost
surely. Using a suitably defined gap function, we derive a convergence rate
statement. This work appears to be the first that provides a convergence speed
guarantee for monotone CSVIs on semidefinite matrix spaces.

demonstrate coherent manipulation of the operating states of partially

laser into the resonator operating with parametric instability state, and
observe significant depression/enhancement of the sidebands when the coherent

depression of partially mode-locked fiber laser is achieved. The experimental
results reveal that the coherent population oscillation in reduced graphene

the induced phase variation is highly asymmetrical. The discovery of coherent

effectively model crack propagation compared with numerical methods based on
discrete crack model, especially for complex crack patterns. Due to the
involvement of \phased field"", phase-field method can be essentially treated a
multifield problem even for pure mechanical problem. Therefore, it is supposed
that the implementation of PFM based on a software developer that especially
supports the solution of multifield problems should be more effective, simpler
and more efficient than PFM implemented on a general finite element software.
In this work, the authors aim to devise a simple and efficient implementation
of phase-field model for the modelling of quasi-static and dynamic fracture in
the general purpose commercial software developer, COMSOL Multiphysics. Notably
only the tensile stress induced crack is accounted for crack evolution by using
the decomposition of elastic strain energy. The width of the diffusive crack is
controlled by a length-scale parameter. Equations that govern body motion and
phase-field evolution are written into different modules in COMSOL, which are
then coupled to a whole system to be solved. A staggered scheme is adopted to
solve the coupled system and each module is solved sequentially during one time
step. A number of 2D and 3D examples are tested to investigate the performance
of the present implementation. Our simulations show good agreement with
previous works, indicating the feasibility and validity of the COMSOL
implementation of PFM.

ambulances and mountain rescue services are often confronted with logistics
challenges and adverse weather conditions that extend the response times
required to provide life-saving support. Among other medical emergencies,
sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the most time-sensitive event that requires the
quick provision of medical treatment including cardiopulmonary resuscitation
and electric shocks by automated external defibrillators (AED). An emerging
technology called unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) is regarded to support
mountain rescuers in overcoming the time criticality of these emergencies by
reducing the time span between SCA and early defibrillation. A drone that is
equipped with a portable AED can fly from a base station to the patient's site
where a bystander receives it and starts treatment. This paper considers such a
response system and proposes an integer linear program to determine the optimal
allocation of drone base stations in a given geographical region. In detail,
the developed model follows the objectives to minimize the number of used
drones and to minimize the average travel times of defibrillator drones
responding to SCA patients. In an example of application, under consideration
of historical helicopter response times, the authors test the developed model
and demonstrate the capability of drones to speed up the delivery of AEDs to
SCA patients. Results indicate that time spans between SCA and early
defibrillation can be reduced by the optimal allocation of drone base stations
in a given geographical region, thus increasing the survival rate of SCA

Investigating the learned representations and features, we find that some of

This framework for WENO weights is new and completely different from the

took an initial step towards that direction. In particular, we choose to focus
on proteins as the linguistic features of protein are the most prominent as
compared with other macromolecules such as DNA or RNA. Concretely, we treat
each protein as a sentence and its constituent domains as words. The meaning of
a word or the sentence is just its biological function, and the arrangement of
domains in a protein corresponds to the syntax. Putting all those into the
DisCoCat framework, we can ""compute"" the function of a protein based on the
functions of its domains with the grammar rules that combine them together.
Since the functions of both the protein and its domains are represented in
vector spaces, we provide a novel way to formalize the functional
representation of proteins.

painting style of a given artist is applied on a real world photograph. We
train our neural networks in adversarial setting via recently introduced
quadratic potential divergence for stable learning process. To further improve
the quality of generated artist stylized images we also integrate some of the
recently introduced deep learning techniques in our method. To our best
knowledge this is the first attempt towards artist style transfer via quadratic
potential divergence. We provide some stylized image samples in the
supplementary material. The source code for experimentation was written in
PyTorch and is available online in my GitHub repository.

"1902.11109","Xuan Liang","Xuan Liang, Yida Xu","Actions Generation from Captions",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sequence transduction models have been widely explored in many natural
language processing tasks. However, the target sequence usually consists of
discrete tokens which represent word indices in a given vocabulary. We barely
see the case where target sequence is composed of continuous vectors, where
each vector is an element of a time series taken successively in a temporal
domain. In this work, we introduce a new data set, named Action Generation Data
Set (AGDS) which is specifically designed to carry out the task of
caption-to-action generation. This data set contains caption-action pairs. The
caption is comprised of a sequence of words describing the interactive movement
between two people, and the action is a captured sequence of poses representing
the movement. This data set is introduced to study the ability of generating
continuous sequences through sequence transduction models. We also propose a
model to innovatively combine Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) together. In our model, we have one generator to
generate actions from captions and three discriminators where each of them is
designed to carry out a unique functionality: caption-action consistency
discriminator, pose discriminator and pose transition discriminator. This novel
design allowed us to achieve plausible generation performance which is
demonstrated in the experiments.

that is informative to policy-makers requires expensive and logistically

poverty stricken regions are also the ones which have a high probability of
being a war zone, have poor infrastructure and sometimes have governments that
do not cooperate with internationally funded development efforts. We train a
CNN on free and publicly available daytime satellite images of the African
continent from Landsat 7 to build a model for predicting local economic
livelihoods. Only 5% of the satellite images can be associated with labels
(which are obtained from DHS Surveys) and thus a semi-supervised approach using
a GAN (similar to the approach of Salimans, et al. (2016)), albeit with a more
stable-to-train flavor of GANs called the Wasserstein GAN regularized with
gradient penalty(Gulrajani, et al. (2017)) is used. The method of multitask
learning is employed to regularize the network and also create an end-to-end
model for the prediction of multiple poverty metrics.

constantly seeing new areas of application, especially in the age of Industry
4.0. This paper introduces a new method, which is suitable for applications in
the healthcare sector, especially for monitoring a health-characteristic of a
patient. We adapt a Markov chain-based approach and develop a method in which
not only the shift size (i.e. the degradation of the patient's health) can be
random, but the effect of the repair (i.e. treatment) and time between
samplings (i.e. visits) too. This means that we do not use many often-present
assumptions which are usually not applicable for medical treatments. The
average cost of the protocol, which is determined by the time between samplings
and the control limit, can be estimated using the stationary distribution of
the Markov chain.
  Furthermore, we incorporate the standard deviation of the cost into the
optimisation procedure, which is often very important from a process control
viewpoint. The sensitivity of the optimal parameters and the resulting average
cost and cost standard deviation on different parameter values is investigated.
We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for real-life data of patients
treated in Hungary: namely the monitoring of cholesterol level of patients with
cardiovascular event risk. The results showed that the optimal parameters from
our approach can be somewhat different from the original medical parameters.

  electronic health records",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large scale electronic health records (EHRs) present an opportunity to
quickly identify suitable individuals in order to directly invite them to
participate in an observational study. EHRs can contain data from millions of
individuals, raising the question of how to optimally select a cohort of size n
from a larger pool of size N. In this paper we propose a simple selective
recruitment protocol that selects a cohort in which covariates of interest tend
to have a uniform distribution. We show that selectively recruited cohorts
potentially offer greater statistical power and more accurate parameter
estimates than randomly selected cohorts. Our protocol can be applied to
studies with multiple categorical and continuous covariates. We apply our
protocol to a numerically simulated prospective observational study using an
EHR database of stable acute coronary disease patients from 82,089 individuals
in the U.K. Selective recruitment designs require a smaller sample size,
leading to more efficient and cost-effective studies.
