behavioral analysis of Darwin when aligning proteins, we propose an algorithmic
improvement to Darwins alignment algorithm, GACT, in the form of a multi-pass

metric such that the action of the covering group $\pi_1(X)$ on $\tilde{X}$ is
of the first kind-i.e., the surface $X$ is equal to its convex core. We first
prove that any geodesic lamination on $X$ is nowhere dense. Given a fixed
geodesic pants decomposition of $X$ we define a family of train tracks on $X$
such that any geodesic lamination of $X$ is weakly carried by at least one
train track. Then we parametrize all measured laminations on $X$ carried by a
train track by the corresponding edge weight systems on the train track.
Furthermore, we show that the weak* topology on the measured laminations weakly
carried by a train track corresponds to a pointwise (weak) convergence of the
edge weight systems.
  When one considers the Teichm\""uller space $T(X)$ of the Riemann surface $X$,
it is natural to restrict the attention to the space $ML_b(X)$ of bounded
measured laminations. When $X$ has a bounded geometry, we prove that a measured
lamination weakly carried by a train track is bounded if and only if the
corresponding edge weight system has a finite supremum norm. The Teichm\""uller
space considerations lead to a natural uniform weak* topology on the space of
bounded measured laminations on $X$. We prove that the correspondence between
bounded measured laminations weakly carried by a train track and their edge
weight systems is a homeomorphism when $ML_b(X)$ is equipped with the uniform
weak* topology and the edge weight system is equipped with the topology induced
by the supremum norm.

problem. One way to alleviate this is through network policy enforcement.
Unfortunately, WiFi lacks protocol support for configuring policies for its
usage, and since network-wide coordination cannot generally be ensured,
enforcing policy is challenging. However, as we have shown in previous work, an
access point can influence the behaviour of connected devices by changing its
scheduling of transmission opportunities, which can be used to achieve airtime
fairness. In this work, we show that this mechanism can be extended to
successfully enforce airtime usage policies in WiFi networks. We implement this
as an extension our previous airtime fairness work, and present PoliFi, the
resulting policy enforcement system. Our evaluation shows that PoliFi makes it
possible to express a range of useful policies. These include prioritisation of
specific devices; balancing groups of devices for sharing between different
logical networks or network slices; and limiting groups of devices to implement
guest networks or other low-priority services. We also show how these can be
used to improve the performance of a real-world DASH video streaming

parameters. We show by theoretical arguments and by means of a simulation study
that the new test controls its level and achieves a reasonable power. Moreover,
it is demonstrated that under the assumption of common parameters a
considerable more powerful test can be constructed compared to the test which
does not use this assumption. Finally, we illustrate potential applications of
the new methodology by a clinical trial example.

Obizhaeva by empirically investigating a large dataset of bets, or metaorders,
provided by ANcerno. The hypothesis predicts that the quantity
$I:=\ri/N^{3/2}$, where $\ri$ is the exchanged risk (volatility $\times$ volume
$\times$ price) and $N$ is the number of bets, is invariant. We find that the
$3/2$ scaling between $\ri$ and $N$ works well and is robust against changes of
year, market capitalisation and economic sector. However our analysis clearly
shows that $I$ is not invariant. We find a very high correlation $R^2>0.8$
between $I$ and the total trading cost (spread and market impact) of the bet.
We propose new invariants defined as a ratio of $I$ and costs and find a large
decrease in variance. We show that the small dispersion of the new invariants
is mainly driven by (i) the scaling of the spread with the volatility per
transaction, (ii) the near invariance of the distribution of metaorder size and
of the volume and number fractions of bets across stocks.

can expect that jet-driven iPTF14hls may last no more than approximately 3,000

the double-peak light curves in some SNe might be explained by the outflow

Although strong coupling, namely having the single-photon Rabi frequency be the
fastest rate in the system, is often assumed essential, this gate (similarly to
the Duan-Kimble C-phase gate) requires only Purcell enhancement, i.e. high
single-atom cooperativity. Accordingly, it does not require small mode volume
cavities, which are challenging to incorporate with ions due to the difficulty
of trapping them close to dielectric surfaces. Instead, larger cavities,
potentially more compatible with the trap apparatus, are sufficient, as long as
their numerical aperture is high enough to maintain small mode area at the
ion's position. We define the optimal parameters for the gate's operation and
simulate the expected fidelities and efficiencies, demonstrating that efficient
photon-ion qubit exchange, a valuable building block for scalable quantum
computation, is practically attainable with current experimental capabilities.

system dynamics are described by a nonlinear partial differential equation for
the film thickness that is nonlocally coupled to the full substrate heat
equation. Perturbing about a steady quiescent state, we find that its stability
is described by a non-self adjoint eigenvalue problem. We show that, under
appropriate model parameters, the linearized eigenvalue problem admits complex

notable progress on one-shot classification, but researchers have adopted new

verification and synthesis of infinite-state (hybrid) systems, etc. As
deterministic finite-state systems, logical control networks (LCNs) consist of
a finite number of nodes which can be in a finite number of states and update
their states. In this paper, we investigate the synthesis problem for
observability of LCNs based on state feedback with exogenous input by using the
semitensor product proposed by Daizhan Cheng and the notion of observability
graph (previously called weighted pair graph) proposed by us. We show that
state feedback with exogenous input can either enforce or weaken observability
of an LCN. We prove that for an LCN $\Sigma$ and another closed-loop LCN
$\Sigma_{\mathcal{C}}$ obtained by feeding a state-feedback controller
$\mathcal{C}$ with exogenous input into $\Sigma$, (1) if $\Sigma$ is
observable, then $\Sigma_{\mathcal{C}}$ can be either observable or not; (2) if
$\Sigma$ is not observable, $\Sigma_{\mathcal{C}}$ can also be observable or
not. We also prove that if an unobservable LCN can be made observable by state
feedback with exogenous input, then it can also be made observable by state
feedback (without exogenous input, equivalent to state feedback with constant
input). Furthermore, we give an upper bound on the number of state-feedback
controllers that are needed to be tested in order to verify whether an
unobservable LCN can be made observable by state feedback, and based on the
procedure of obtaining the upper bound, we design an observability synthesis
algorithm, by additionally combining the ideas of a greedy algorithm and
dynamic programming. These results open the study of observability synthesis in
LCNs.

nuclei as well as in X-ray binaries. The compactness of the source implies a
strong radial dependence in the illumination of the accretion disc. This will,
for any reasonable radial profile of the density, lead to a radial profile of
the disc ionisation. Svoboda et al. (2012) showed on a single example that
assuming a radially-structured ionisation profile of the disc can cause an
artificial increase of the radial-emissivity parameter. We further investigate
how the X-ray spectra are modified and quantify this effect for a wide range of
parameters. Computations are carried out with the current state-of-the-art
models for relativistic reflection. We simulated spectra using the response
files of the micro-calorimeter X-IFU, which is planned to be on board of
Athena. We assumed typical parameters for X-ray bright Seyfert-1 galaxies and
considered two scenarios for the disc ionisation: 1) a radial profile for the
disc ionisation, 2) a constant disc ionisation. We found that steep emissivity
profiles can be indeed achieved due to the radial profile of the disc
ionisation, which becomes more important for the cases where the corona is
located at low heights above the black hole and this effect may be even more
prominent than the geometrical effects. We also found that the cases with high
inner disc ionisation, rapidly decreasing with radius, may result in an
inaccurate black hole spin measurements.

novel approach for validating Huff gravity market share model, using a

in the context of competitive facility location and demand allocation, this
paper is the first in validating the Huff model with a real dataset. Our
approach helps to easily apply the model in different regions and with
different merchant categories. Experimental results show that the Huff model
fits well when modeling customer shopping behavior for a number of shopping
categories including grocery stores, clothing stores, gas stations, and
restaurants. We also conduct regression analysis to show that certain features
such as gender diversity and marital status diversity lead to stronger
validation of the Huff model. We believe we provide strong evidence, with the

tuning the fault detection algorithms to avoid event misclassification, causes
them to miss the majority of actual faults. In addition to exposing the tension

novel fault detection mechanisms which incorporate knowledge of the underlying

hydrogen molecule within Kohn Sham (KS) local spin density function theory with
Dirac exchange (the XLDA model). This simplified model shows behavior related
to that of the (KS) spin density functional theory (SDFT) predictions in
condensed and molecular systems. The Kohn Sham solutions to the constrained
SDFT variation problem undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking as the relative
strength of the non-convex exchange term increases. This results in the change
of the molecular ground state from a paramagnetic state to an antiferromagnetic
ground states and a stationary symmetric delocalized 1st excited state. We
further characterize the limiting behavior of the minimizer when the strength
of the exchange term goes to infinity. This leads to further bifurcations and
highly localized states with varying character. The stability of the various
solution classes is demonstrated by Hessian analysis. Finite element numerical
results provide support for the formal conjectures.

accountability via model interpretability. But what does it mean for a machine
learning model to be interpretable by humans, and how can this be assessed? We
focus on two definitions of interpretability that have been introduced in the
machine learning literature: simulatability (a user's ability to run a model on
a given input) and ""what if"" local explainability (a user's ability to
correctly determine a model's prediction under local changes to the input,
given knowledge of the model's original prediction). Through a user study with
1,000 participants, we test whether humans perform well on tasks that mimic the
definitions of simulatability and ""what if"" local explainability on models that
are typically considered locally interpretable. To track the relative
interpretability of models, we employ a simple metric, the runtime operation
count on the simulatability task. We find evidence that as the number of
operations increases, participant accuracy on the local interpretability tasks
decreases. In addition, this evidence is consistent with the common intuition
that decision trees and logistic regression models are interpretable and are
more interpretable than neural networks.

intricate spiking networks. Due to the inherent complexity of neural models,
relating the spiking activity of a network to its structure requires
simplifying assumptions, such as considering models in the thermodynamic
mean-field limit. In the thermodynamic mean-field limit, an infinite number of
neurons interact via vanishingly small interactions, thereby erasing the finite
size of interactions. To better capture the finite-size effects of
interactions, we propose to analyze the activity of neural networks in the
replica-mean-field limit. Replica-mean-field models are made of infinitely many
replicas which interact according to the same basic structure as that of the
finite network of interest. Here, we analytically characterize the stationary
dynamics of an intensity-based neural network with spiking reset and
heterogeneous excitatory synapses in the replica-mean-field limit.
Specifically, we functionally characterize the stationary dynamics of these
limit networks via ordinary differential equations derived from the Poisson
Hypothesis of queuing theory. We then reduce this functional characterization
to a system of self-consistency equations specifying the stationary neuronal
firing rates. Of general applicability, our approach combines rate-conservation
principles from point-process theory and analytical considerations from
generating-function methods. We validate our approach by demonstrating
numerically that replica-mean-field models better capture the dynamics of
neural networks with large, sparse connections than their thermodynamic
counterparts. Finally, we explain that improved performance by analyzing the
neuronal rate-transfer functions, which saturate due to finite-size effects in
the replica-mean-field limit.

analyzing the cyber-physical security of time-critical UAV applications. A
general UAV security network interdiction game is formulated to model
interactions between a UAV operator and an interdictor, each of which can be
benign or malicious. In this game, the interdictor chooses the optimal
location(s) from which to target the drone system by interdicting the potential
paths of the UAVs. Meanwhile, the UAV operator responds by finding an optimal
path selection policy that enables its UAVs to evade attacks and minimize their
mission completion time. New notions from cumulative prospect theory (PT) are
incorporated into the game to capture the operator's and interdictor's
subjective valuations of mission completion times and perceptions of the risk
levels facing the UAVs. The equilibrium of the game, with and without PT, is
then analytically characterized and studied. Novel algorithms are then proposed
to reach the game's equilibria under both PT and classical game theory.
Simulation results show the properties of the equilibrium for both the rational
and PT cases. The results show that the operator's and interdictor's bounded
rationality is more likely to be disadvantageous to the UAV operator.

reduces population growth rates and, thereby, can increase extinction risk. In
contrast, the SAS-CFF model demonstrates that environmental stochasticity can
promote genetic diversity. Extending the SAS-CFF to account for demography, I
examine the simultaneous effects of environmental stochasticity on genetic
diversity and population persistence. Consistent with Gillespie's analysis, if
the log-fitness function is concave and allelic responses to the environment
are not perfectly correlated, then per-capita growth rates of rare alleles are
positive and genetic diversity is maintained in the sense of stochastic
persistence i.e. allelic frequencies tend to stay away from zero almost-surely
and in probability. Alternatively, if the log-fitness function is convex, then
per-capita growth rates of rare alleles are negative and an allele
asymptotically fixates with probability one. If the population's low-density,
per-capita growth rate is positive, then the population persists in the sense
of stochastic persistence, else it goes asymptotically extinct with probability
one. In contrast to per-capita growth rates of rare alleles, the population's
per-capita growth rate is a decreasing function of the concavity of the
log-fitness function. Moreover, when the log-fitness function is concave,
allelic diversity increases the population's per-capita growth rate while
decreasing the per-capita growth rate of rare alleles, and environmental
stochasticity increases the per-capita growth rate of rare alleles but
decreases the population's per-capita growth rate. Collectively, these results
(i) highlight how mechanisms promoting population persistence may be at odds
with mechanisms promoting genetic diversity, and (ii) provide conditions under
which population persistence relies on existing standing genetic variation.

maximal Lyapunov exponent. On that basis, an interpretation of the energy

analyzed, and a proper bifurcation analysis of the closed von

from developed turbulence toward the non--chaotic regimes, leading to an
estimate of the critical Taylor scale Reynolds number. A proper statistical
decomposition based on extended distribution functions and on the

a significant portion of application performance bottlenecks and power budget
demands inside the computing ecosystem. To alleviate the problems of storage
density and power constraints associated with DRAM, system architects are
investigating alternative non-volatile memory technologies such as Phase Change
Memory (PCM) to either replace or be used alongside DRAM memory. While such
alternative memory types offer many promises to overcome the DRAM-related
issues, they present a significant security threat to the users due to
persistence of memory data even after power down.
  In this paper, we investigate smart mechanisms to obscure the data left in
non-volatile memory after power down. In particular, we analyze the effect of
using a single encryption algorithm versus differentiated encryption based on
the security needs of the application phases. We also explore the effect of
encryption on a hybrid main memory that has a DRAM buffer cache plus PCM main
memory. Our mechanism takes into account the limited write endurance problem
associated with several non-volatile memory technologies including PCM, and
avoids any additional writes beyond those originally issued by the
applications. We evaluate using Gem5 simulator and SPEC 2006 applications, and
show the performance and power overheads of our proposed design.

  In the fair variant of $k$-median, the points are colored, and the goal is to

  Chierichetti et al. proposed a two-phase algorithm for fair $k$-clustering.
In the first step, the pointset is partitioned into subsets called fairlets
that satisfy the fairness requirement and approximately preserve the $k$-median

the existing $k$-median algorithms. The running time of this algorithm is
dominated by the first step, which takes super-quadratic time.
  In this paper, we present a practical approximate fairlet decomposition

for finer control over the balance of resulting clusters than the original

Utilization (ISRU) in the course of human or robotic space exploration that

highlighted by many in the space community as a credible solution for
affordable/sustainable exploration. Water can be extracted from the Moon,
C-class Near Earth Objects (NEOs), surface of Mars and Martian Moons Pho-bos
and Deimos and from the surface of icy, rugged terrains of Ocean Worlds.
However, use of water for propulsion faces some important techno-logical
barriers. A technique to use water as a propellant is to electrolyze it into
hydrogen and oxygen that is then pulse-detonated. High-efficiency elec-trolysis
requires use of platinum-catalyst based fuel cells. Even trace ele-ments of
sulfur and carbon monoxide found on planetary bodies can poison these cells
making them unusable. In this work, we develop steam-based propulsion that
avoids the technological barriers of electrolyzing impure water as propellant.
Using a solar concentrator, heat is used to extract the water which is then
condensed as a liquid and stored. Steam is then formed using the solar thermal
reflectors to concentrate the light into a nanoparticle-water mix. This solar
thermal heating (STH) process converts 80 to 99% of the in-coming light into

crucial step in various applications. In this paper, we first propose a simple
method for sure screening interactions (SSI). Although its computation
complexity is $O(p^2n)$, SSI works well for problems of moderate dimensionality
(e.g., $p=10^3\sim10^4$), without the heredity assumption. To ultra-high
dimensional problems (e.g., $p = 10^6$), motivated by discretization associated
Boolean representation and operations and the contingency table for discrete
variables, we propose a fast algorithm, named ""BOLT-SSI"". The statistical
theory has been established for SSI and BOLT-SSI, guaranteeing their sure
screening property. The performance of SSI and BOLT-SSI are evaluated by
comprehensive simulation and real case studies. Numerical results demonstrate
that SSI and BOLT-SSI can often outperform their competitors in terms of
computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. The proposed method can be
applied for fully detecting interactions with more than 300,000 predictors.
Based on this study, we believe that there is a great need to rethink the
relationship between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. We have
shown that the computational performance of a statistical method can often be
greatly improved by exploring the advantages of computational architecture with
a tolerable loss of statistical accuracy.

the global motion patterns of bio-molecular assemblies. However, it is not
clear exactly how shape determines the motion patterns. What about the local
interactions that hold a structure together to a certain shape? The
contributions of global shape and local interactions usually mix together and
are difficult to tease part. In this work, we use symmetry to elucidate the
distinct roles of global shape and local interactions in protein dynamics.
Symmetric complexes provide an ideal platform for this task since in them the
effects of local interactions and global shape are separable, allowing their
distinct roles to be identified. Our key findings based on symmetric assemblies
are: (i) the motion patterns of each subunit are determined primarily by
intra-subunit interactions (IRSi), and secondarily by inter-subunit
interactions (IESi); (ii) the motion patterns of the whole assembly are fully
dictated by the global symmetry/shape and have nothing to do with local iESi or
IRSi. This is followed by a discussion on how the findings may be generalized
to complexes in any shape, with or without symmetry.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis in children. We
search for motor activity features that could allow further investigation into

  Method The study involved $n=29$ (48 eligible) male participants aged
$9.89\pm0.92$ years (8 controls, and 7 in each group: ADHD combined subtype,
ADHD hyperactive-impulsive subtype, and autism spectrum disorder, ASD) wearing
a wristwatch actigraph continuously for a week ($9\%$ losses in daily records)
in two acquisition modes. We analyzed 47 quantities: from sleep duration or
movement intensity to theory-driven scaling exponents or non-linear prediction
errors of both diurnal and nocturnal activity. We used them in supervised
classification to obtain cross-validated diagnostic performance.
  Results We report the best performing measures, including a nearest neighbors
4-feature classifier providing $69.4\pm1.6\%$ accuracy, $78.0\pm2.2\%$
sensitivity and $60.8\pm2.6\%$ specificity in a binary ADHD vs control

$61.8\pm1.4\%$ sensitivity and $79.30 \pm0.43\%$ specificity in 4-class task
(two ADHD subtypes, ASD, and control). The most informative feature is skewness
of the shape of Zero Crossing Mode (ZCM) activity. Mean and standard deviation
of nocturnal activity are among the least informative.
  Conclusion Actigraphy causes only minor discomfort to the subjects and is
inexpensive. The range of existing mathematical and machine learning tools also
allow it to be a useful add-on test for ADHD or differential diagnosis between
ADHD subtypes. The study was limited to a small, male sample without the
inattentive ADHD subtype.

algorithms. Given access to a collection of $m$ sets over $n$ elements in the
query model, we show that sub-linear algorithms derived from existing
techniques have almost tight query complexities.
  On one hand, first we show an adaptation of the streaming algorithm presented
in Har-Peled et al. [2016] to the sub-linear query model, that returns an
$\alpha$-approximate cover using $\tilde{O}(m(n/k)^{1/(\alpha-1)} + nk)$
queries to the input, where $k$ denotes the value of a minimum set cover. We
then complement this upper bound by proving that for lower values of $k$, the
required number of queries is $\tilde{\Omega}(m(n/k)^{1/(2\alpha)})$, even for
estimating the optimal cover size. Moreover, we prove that even checking
whether a given collection of sets covers all the elements would require
$\Omega(nk)$ queries. These two lower bounds provide strong evidence that the
upper bound is almost tight for certain values of the parameter $k$.
  On the other hand, we show that this bound is not optimal for larger values
of the parameter $k$, as there exists a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm with $\tilde{O}(mn/k\varepsilon^2)$ queries. We show that this bound
is essentially tight for sufficiently small constant $\varepsilon$, by

access (NOMA) over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in uplink single-cell
systems. In both single-antenna and multi-antenna scenarios, the performance
gain of NOMA over OMA in terms of asymptotic ergodic sum-rate is analyzed for a
sufficiently large number of users. In particular, in single-antenna systems,
we identify two types of near-far gains brought by NOMA: 1) the large-scale
near-far gain via exploiting the large-scale fading increases with the cell
size; 2) the small-scale near-far gain via exploiting the small-scale fading is
a constant given by $\gamma = 0.57721$ nat/s/Hz in Rayleigh fading channels.
Furthermore, we have analyzed that the performance gain achieved by
single-antenna NOMA can be amplified via increasing the number of antennas
equipped at the base station due to the extra spatial degrees of freedom. The
numerical results confirm the accuracy of the derived analyses and unveil the
performance gains of NOMA over OMA in different scenarios.

considerably faster under the excitation of cubic azimuthal mode. The gyration

received a lot of attention. Recently, an interesting connection between the
age of information and remote estimation error was found in a sampling problem
of Wiener processes: If the sampler has no knowledge of the signal being
sampled, the optimal sampling strategy is to minimize the age of information;
however, by exploiting causal knowledge of the signal values, it is possible to
achieve a smaller estimation error. In this paper, we extend a previous study
by investigating a problem of sampling a stationary Gauss-Markov process,
namely the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The optimal sampling problem is
formulated as a constrained continuous-time Markov decision process (MDP) with
an uncountable state space. We provide an exact solution to this MDP: The
optimal sampling policy is a threshold policy on instantaneous estimation error
and the threshold is found. Further, if the sampler has no knowledge of the OU
process, the optimal sampling problem reduces to an MDP for minimizing a
nonlinear age of information metric. The age-optimal sampling policy is a
threshold policy on expected estimation error and the threshold is found. These
results hold for (i) general service time distributions of the queueing server
and (ii) sampling problems both with and without a sampling rate constraint.
Numerical results are provided to compare different sampling policies.

reduce the temperature gradient in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs similarly to
moist convection in Earth atmosphere thus possibly explaining the reddening in
brown-dwarf spectra. By using idealized two-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations in the Ledoux unstable regime, we show that compositional source
terms can indeed provoke a reduction of the temperature gradient. The L/T
transition could be explained by a bifurcation between the adiabatic and
diabatic convective transports and could be seen as a giant cooling crisis: an
analog of the boiling crisis in liquid/steam-water convective flows. This
mechanism with other chemical transitions could be present in many giant and
earth-like exoplanets. The study of the impact of different parameters

$\sim$ 4.1 much larger than the predicted maximum value. Besides, the elastic
creep in the vortex phase diagram of Li$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$OHFeSe is found to
reside only in an extremely small region. Such a large value of $\mu$ and the
small elastic creep region may be originated from the weakening of coupling
between the vortices in neighbouring layers by elongating the layer distance.
It may indicate that the vortex structure of Li$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$OHFeSe is in
the crossover regime between elastic Abrikosov vortices to stacks of pancake
vortices. Our study also suggests that the intercalated FeSe is a promising
candidate for searching intrinsic Josephson phenomena.

a graph $G=(V,E)$ that spell the same string as the given pattern $P[1..m]$.
This basic problem can be found at the heart of more complex operations on
variation graphs in computational biology, query operations in graph databases,
and analysis of heterogeneous networks, where the nodes of some paths must
match a sequence of labels or types. In our recent work we described a
conditional lower bound stating that the exact pattern matching problem in
labeled graphs cannot be solved in less than quadratic time, namely, $O(|E|^{1
- \epsilon} \, m)$ time or $O(|E| \, m^{1 - \epsilon})$ time for any constant
$\epsilon>0$, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false.
The result holds even if node labels and pattern $P$ are drawn from a binary
alphabet, and $G$ is restricted to undirected graphs of maximum degree three or
directed acyclic graphs of maximum sum of indegree and outdegree three. It was
left open what happens on undirected graphs of maximum degree two, i.e., when
the pattern can have a zig-zag match in a (cyclic) bidirectional string. Also,
the reduction created a non-determistic directed acyclic graph, and it was left
open if determinism would make the problem easier. In this work, we show
through the Orthogonal Vectors hypothesis (OV) that the same conditional lower
bound holds even for these restricted cases.

terms of Majorana operators can be decoupled into independent subspaces
represented by different number of Majorana fermions. The relaxation is
characterized by multiply time scales, and in the long-time limit it is
determined by the single particle relaxation process in a typical time scale
$T^*$. For the bulk bands, we find $T^* \propto N^3/\gamma n^2 $ in the weak
dissipation limit; and $T^* \propto \gamma N^3/ n^2$ in the strong dissipation
limit, where $N$ is the chain length, $\gamma$ is the dissipation rate and $n$
is the band index. For the edge modes $T^* \propto 1/\gamma$, indicating of
most vulnerable to dissipation in the long chain limit. These results are
counter-intuitive because it means any weak dissipation can induce relaxation,
while strong dissipation can induce weak relaxation. We find that these two
limits correspond to two different physics, which are explained based on the
first and second-order perturbation theory in an equivalent non-Hermitian

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Near infrared-visible (NIR-VIS) heterogeneous face recognition refers to the
process of matching NIR to VIS face images. Current heterogeneous methods try
to extend VIS face recognition methods to the NIR spectrum by synthesizing VIS
images from NIR images. However, due to self-occlusion and sensing gap, NIR
face images lose some visible lighting contents so that they are always
incomplete compared to VIS face images. This paper models high resolution
heterogeneous face synthesis as a complementary combination of two components,
a texture inpainting component and pose correction component. The inpainting
component synthesizes and inpaints VIS image textures from NIR image textures.
The correction component maps any pose in NIR images to a frontal pose in VIS
images, resulting in paired NIR and VIS textures. A warping procedure is
developed to integrate the two components into an end-to-end deep network. A
fine-grained discriminator and a wavelet-based discriminator are designed to
supervise intra-class variance and visual quality respectively. One UV loss,
two adversarial losses and one pixel loss are imposed to ensure synthesis
results. We demonstrate that by attaching the correction component, we can
simplify heterogeneous face synthesis from one-to-many unpaired image
translation to one-to-one paired image translation, and minimize spectral and
pose discrepancy during heterogeneous recognition. Extensive experimental
results show that our network not only generates high-resolution VIS face
images and but also facilitates the accuracy improvement of heterogeneous face
recognition.

Greenland Ice Sheet can vary on the time scale of years to hours. Such flow
speed variations can be explained as the reaction to changes in terminus
geometry with help of a 3D full-Stokes ice flow model. Starting from an initial
steady state geometry, parts of an initially 7 km long floating terminus are
removed. Flow velocity increases everywhere up to 4 km upstream of the
grounding line, and complete removal of the floating terminus leads to a
doubling of flow speed. The model results conclusively show that the observed
velocity variations of outlet glaciers is dominated by the terminus geometry.
Since terminus geometry is mainly controlled by calving processes and melting
under the floating portion, changing ocean conditions most probably have
triggered the recent geometry and velocity variations of Greenland outlet
glaciers.

In this paper, we provide an alternate point of view. In driven-dissipative
nonequilibrium systems forced at large scale, the energy flows from large
scales to dissipative scales. This generic and multiscale process breaks time
reversal symmetry and principle of detailed balance, thus can yield an arrow of
time. In this paper we propose that conversion of large-scale coherence to
small-scales incoherence could be treated as a dissipation mechanism for
generic physical systems. We illustrate the above processes using turbulence as

was based on the fact that steel density determined by the method of liquid
displacement is less than that of steel in both initial condition and after
fracture under the cyclic loads exceeding tensile yield stress values. In the
latter case steel hardness increases, whereas the steels fractured under the
cyclic stresses less than their tensile yield stress values show no change in
hardness. It means that in such a case metal fractures without strain
hardening, i.e. undergoes brittle fracturing developing by vacancy mechanism
rather than by dislocation one. As a result such steel obtains the structure

The learning problem for this agent is made difficult by the fact that

actions by best responding with respect to probabilistic beliefs maintained

lower variance of return than baselines, including a Q-learning agent and a

Dirac operator satisfying the axioms of a real spectral triple. This paper
addreses the question of how to extract information about these geometries from
the spectrum of the Dirac operator. Since the Dirac operator is a
finite-dimensional matrix, the usual asymptotics of the eigenvalues makes no
sense and is replaced by measurements of the spectrum at a finite energy scale.
The spectral dimension of the square of the Dirac operator is improved to
provide a new spectral measure of the dimension of a space called the spectral
variance. Similarly, the volume of a space can be computed from the spectrum
once the dimension is known. Two methods of doing this are investigated: the
well-known Dixmier trace and a recent improvement due to Abel Stern. Finally,
the distance between two geometries is investigated by comparing the spectral
zeta functions using the method of Cornelissen and Kontogeorgis. All of these
techniques are tested on the explicit examples of the fuzzy spheres and fuzzy
tori, which can be regarded as approximations of the usual Riemannian sphere
and flat tori. Then they are applied to characterise some random fuzzy spaces

This allows us to use the existing techniques for parabolic control problems in

the neutrinos are produced in three-particle weak decays of nuclei and detected
in the charged-current interaction with nuclei or in the charged- and
neutral-current interactions with electrons. Particular examples are considered
and it is shown that the momentum spread of the produced neutrinos and the
energy dependence of the differential cross section of the detection process
result in the suppression of neutrino oscillation, which is characterized by a
coherence length specific for a pair of production and detection processes.
This coherence length turns out to be much less than the coherence length in
the standard quantum-mechanical approach defined by the quantum uncertainty of
neutrino momentum.

constraint, the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger (NLS) equation on the star graph can
be transformed to the NLS equation on a real line. Such balanced star graphs
have appeared in the context of reflectionless transmission of solitary waves.
Steady states on such balanced star graphs can be translated along the edges
with a translational parameter and are referred to as the shifted states. When
the star graph has exactly one incoming edge and several outgoing edges, the
steady states are spectrally stable if their monotonic tails are located on the
outgoing edges. These spectrally stable states are degenerate minimizers of the
action functional with the degeneracy due to the translational symmetry.
Nonlinear stability of these spectrally stable states has been an open problem
up to now. In this paper, we prove that these spectrally stable states are
nonlinearly unstable because of the irreversible drift along the incoming edge
towards the vertex of the star graph. When the shifted states reach the vertex
as a result of the drift, they become saddle points of the action functional,
in which case the nonlinear instability leads to their destruction. In addition
to rigorous mathematical results, we use numerical simulations to illustrate
the drift instability and destruction of the shifted states on the balanced

types of astrophysical transients. The detection of such phenomena, whose
characteristics are presently poorly constrained, will hinge on the ability to
perform blind searches. We present a new algorithm for this purpose, based on
deep learning. We incorporate two approaches, utilising anomaly detection and
classification techniques. The first is model-independent, avoiding the use of
background modelling and instrument simulations. The second method enables
targeted searches, relying on generic spectral and temporal patterns as input.
We compare our methodology with the existing approach to serendipitous
detection of gamma-ray transients. The algorithm is shown to be more robust,
especially for non-trivial spectral features. We use our framework to derive
the detection prospects of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts with the upcoming
Cherenkov Telescope Array. Our method is an unbiased, completely data-driven
approach for multiwavelength and multi-messenger transient detection.

for the Einstein field equations; and we also assume a time-independent
gravitational metric implied by a static picture of the particles' motion. The
resulting formula will allow serious modelling to test the idea that cosmic

gravitational effects now ascribed to some mysterious Dark Matter.

field of view camera (PAUCam) has been designed, built, commissioned and is now
operated at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). With the current WHT Prime
Focus corrector, the camera covers ~1-degree diameter Field of View (FoV), of
which, only the inner ~40 arcmin diameter are unvignetted. The focal plane
consists of a mosaic of 18 2k$x4k Hamamatsu fully depleted CCDs, with high
quantum efficiency up to 1 micrometers in wavelength. To maximize the detector
coverage within the FoV, filters are placed in front of the CCDs inside the
camera cryostat (made out of carbon fiber) using a challenging movable tray
system. The camera uses a set of 40 narrow band filters ranging from ~4500 to
~8500 Angstroms complemented with six standard broad-band filters, ugrizY. The
PAU Survey aims to cover roughly 100 square degrees over fields with existing
deep photometry and galaxy shapes to obtain accurate photometric redshifts for
galaxies down to i_AB~22.5, detecting also galaxies down to i_AB~24 with less
precision in redshift. With this data set we will be able to measure intrinsic
alignments, galaxy clustering and perform galaxy evolution studies in a new
range of densities and redshifts. Here, we describe the PAU camera, its first
commissioning results and performance.

build reliable and secure cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in a systematic manner.
In this methodology, a designer first constructs a model, with mathematically
precise semantics, of the system under design, and performs extensive analysis
with respect to correctness requirements before generating the implementation
from the model. However, as new vulnerabilities are discovered, requirements
evolve aimed at ensuring resiliency. There is currently a shortage of an
inexpensive, automated mechanism that can effectively repair the initial
design, and a model-based system developer regularly needs to redesign and
reimplement the system from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new
methodology along with a Matlab toolkit called REAFFIRM to facilitate the
model-based repair for improving the resiliency of CPSs. REAFFIRM takes the
inputs including 1) an original hybrid system modeled as a Simulink/Stateflow
diagram, 2) a given resiliency pattern specified as a model transformation
script, and 3) a safety requirement expressed as a Signal Temporal Logic
formula, and then outputs a repaired model which satisfies the requirement. The
overall structure of REAFFIRM contains two main modules, a model
transformation, and a model synthesizer built on top of the falsification tool
Breach. We introduce a new model transformation language for hybrid systems,
which we call HATL to allow a designer to specify resiliency patterns. To
evaluate the proposed approach, we use REAFFIRM to automatically synthesize
repaired models for an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system under a GPS sensor
spoofing attack, for a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system under a
sliding-mode switching attack, and for a missile guidance system under
gyroscopes sensor attack.

dissipation in quantum systems. Several existing nonlinear equations are then
derived and discussed in this context leading to a continuity equation with an
extra source/sink term which violates Ehrenfest theorem. An extension to
describe stochastic dynamics is also carried out by including thermal
fluctuations or noise of the environment. These two generalized nonlinear
equations are analyzed within the Bohmian mechanics framework to describe the
corresponding dissipative and stochastic dynamics in terms of quantum
trajectories. Several applications of this second generalized equation which
can be considered as a generalized Kostin equation have been carried out. The
first application consists of the study of the position-momentum uncertainty
principle in a dissiaptive dynamics. After, the so-called Brownian-Bohmian
motion is investigated by calculating classical and quantum diffusion
coefficients. And as a third example, transmission through a transient (time
dependent) parabolic repeller is studied where the interesting phenomenon of
early arrival is observed even in the stochastic dynamics although the
magnitude of early arrival is reduced by friction.

self-gravity so small that it virtually guarantees dynamical stability for
millions of years of evolution to come. Compared to HL Tau, the scale length

around the globe due to their low cost, easy access and rapid dissemination.
This however comes at the cost of dubious trustworthiness and significant risk
of exposure to 'fake news', intentionally written to mislead the readers.
Automatically detecting fake news poses challenges that defy existing
content-based analysis approaches. One of the main reasons is that often the
interpretation of the news requires the knowledge of political or social
context or 'common sense', which current NLP algorithms are still missing.
Recent studies have shown that fake and real news spread differently on social
media, forming propagation patterns that could be harnessed for the automatic
fake news detection. Propagation-based approaches have multiple advantages
compared to their content-based counterparts, among which is language
independence and better resilience to adversarial attacks. In this paper we
show a novel automatic fake news detection model based on geometric deep
learning. The underlying core algorithms are a generalization of classical CNNs
to graphs, allowing the fusion of heterogeneous data such as content, user
profile and activity, social graph, and news propagation. Our model was trained
and tested on news stories, verified by professional fact-checking
organizations, that were spread on Twitter. Our experiments indicate that
social network structure and propagation are important features allowing highly
accurate (92.7% ROC AUC) fake news detection. Second, we observe that fake news
can be reliably detected at an early stage, after just a few hours of
propagation. Third, we test the aging of our model on training and testing data
separated in time. Our results point to the promise of propagation-based
approaches for fake news detection as an alternative or complementary strategy
to content-based approaches.

  Neutrino Mass for Inverted Ordering Spectrum","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1505.00978 by other authors","Advances in High Energy Physics, vol. 2019,","10.1155/2019/4863620",,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Inspired by the experimental anomalies in neutrino physics and recent
oscillation data from short baseline and another neutrino experiment, the
realization of one extra neutrino flavor seem to be favoring. This extra flavor
may change the observable, $|m_{\beta\beta}|$ of currently data taking and
next-generation $(\beta\beta)_{0\nu}$-decay experiments aim to probe and
possibly look the Inverted Ordering region($|m_{\beta\beta}| \simeq 10^{-2}$eV)
of parameter space. This observation would allow establishing physics beyond
the standard model and phenomena like lepton number violation and Majorana
nature of neutrino. The range of this observable ($|m_{\beta\beta}|$) is not
very well defined for both the ordering of mass spectrum(Normal Ordering and
Inverted Ordering). Several attempts have been made for defining exactly the
range for three active neutrino states. For contrasting this range, I have
worked with an extra mass states, $\nu_{4}$ and its effect on the observable
with various combination of CP violation Majorana phases by taking into account
the updated data on the neutrino oscillation parameters for IO case. Based on
the Monte Carlo technique, a parameter region is obtained using the fourth
Majorana-Dirac phase of sterile parameters that lead to an effective mass below
0.01 eV or .05 eV for inverted mass ordering case which is planned to be
observed in the near future experiment.

information, most of which is partially redundant. Redundancy is eliminated by
dimensionality reduction, but contemporary digital processing techniques face
harsh fundamental tradeoffs when implementing this class of functions. These
tradeoffs can be broken in the analog domain, in which the performance of
optical technologies greatly exceeds that of electronic counterparts. Here, we
present concepts, methods, and a first demonstration of multivariate photonics:
a combination of integrated photonic hardware, analog dimensionality reduction,
and blind algorithmic techniques. We experimentally demonstrate 2-channel, 1.0
GHz principal component analysis in a photonic weight bank using recently
proposed algorithms for synthesizing the multivariate properties of signals to
which the receiver is blind. Novel methods are introduced for controlling
blindness conditions in a laboratory context. This work provides a foundation
for further research in multivariate photonic information processing, which is
poised to play a role in future generations of wireless technology.
