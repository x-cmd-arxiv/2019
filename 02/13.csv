deliver contents to end users. In order to minimize the experienced
communication cost, it is necessary to send the end user's requests to the
nearest servers. However, it is shown that this naive method causes some
servers to get overloaded. Similarly, when distributing the requests to avoid
overloading, the communication cost increases. This is a well-known trade-off
between communication cost and load balancing in CDNs.
  In this work, by introducing a new meta-heuristic algorithm, we try to
optimize this trade-off, that is, to have less-loaded servers at lower
experienced communication cost. This trade-off is even better managed when we
optimize the way servers update their information of each others' load. The
proposed scheme, which is based on Honeybee algorithm, is an implementation of
bees algorithm which is known for solving continuous optimization problems. Our
proposed version for CDNs is a combination of a request redirecting method and
a server information update algorithm.
  To evaluate the suggested method in a large-scale network, we leveraged our
newly developed CDN simulator which takes into account all the important
network parameters in the scope of our problem. The simulation results show
that our proposed scheme achieves a better trade-off between the communication
cost and load balancing in CDNs, compared to previously proposed schemes.

of beyond-Standard-Model physics is often claimed to be unnatural. Sometimes,
the apparent disparity between the measured Higgs mass and the size of the
typical loop corrections encountered within such schemes is even interpretted
as a profound indication that one should expect a remedy just behind the
corner, probably in form of a new physics such as low-scale supersymmetry, new
strong dynamics etc. In reality, all such potentially large corrections in the
one- and two-point Green's functions cancel with each other in the physical
Higgs mass $m_{H}$ which eventually turns out to be driven only by the
electroweak VEV $v$. This, naively, may look like a miracle, the more that the
standard perturbative approach often makes it irresistible to discuss the
magnitudes of those corrections as if, individually, they were physically
relevant. To shed some more light on this conundrum we advocate a method based
on the symmetry properties of the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential which
not only makes it very clear why $m_H\propto v$ to all orders in the
perturbative expansion but, at the same time, it does not require any
inspection of the explicit form of the tadpole equations whatsoever. Besides
simplifying the calculations considerably it makes the ""internal composition""
of the VEV in terms of the high-scale parameters essentially irrelevant. We
exemplify these findings on an extended series of specific simplified models in
which the role of the heavy dynamics is played by all ""reasonable"" types of
fields (barring gravity), i.e., by a heavy scalar, a heavy (Majorana) fermion
and a heavy vector, respectively. We show that the dependence of $m_{H}$ on the
heavy scale follows the expectation based on dynamical arguments such as the
decoupling theorem.

$$S_1\to\mu^++\tau^-,\qquad S_1\to\mu^-+\tau^+$$ where $S_1$ is an analog of
the standard model Higgs boson, are considered. The widths of this decays are
found in the third order of the perturbation theory. Since the main
contribution to the decay widths is caused by the diagram with the light and
heavy neutrinos in the virtual state then investigation of this decays could
shed light upon the neutrino sector structure. The obtained decay widths
critically depend on the charged gauge bosons mixing angle $\xi$ and the
heavy-light neutrinos mixing angle $\varphi$. The LRM predicts the values of
these angles as functions of the vacuum expectation values $v_L$ and $v_R$.
Using the results of the existing experiments, on looking for the additional
charged gauge boson $W_2$ and on measuring the electroweak $\rho$ parameter,
gives $$\sin\xi\leq5\times10^{-4},\qquad\sin\varphi\leq2.3\times10^{-2}. $$
However, even using the upper bounds on $\sin\xi$ and $\sin\varphi$ one does
not manage to get the upper experimental bound on the branching ratio
$\mbox{BR}(S_1\to\tau\mu)_{exp}$ being equal to $0.25\times10^{-2}$. The
theoretical expression proves to be on two orders of magnitude less than
$\mbox{BR}(S_1\to\tau\mu)_{exp}$.

the phase transition in Pb$_2$CoOsO$_6$ is driven by a long-range collinear

gas. The collection of star-forming knots presents a metallicity gradient
steadily decreasing from the centre of the galaxy outwards, and the ages of the
stars across the galaxy show that the tails formed <10^9 yr ago. This result is
consistent with an estimate of the stripping timescale (1 Gyr), obtained from a
toy orbital model. Overall, our results independently and consistently support
a scenario in which a recent or ongoing event of intense ram-pressure stripping
acting from the outer disk inwards, causes removal and compression of gas, thus
altering the AGN and star-formation activity within and around the galaxy.

focused on the dichotomy between Value at Risk (VaR) -- a quantile -- and
Expected Shortfall (ES) -- a tail expectation. Range Value at Risk (RVaR) is a
natural interpolation between these two prominent risk measures, which
constitutes a tradeoff between the sensitivity of the latter and the robustness
of the former, turning it into a practically relevant risk measure on its own.
As such, there is a need to statistically validate RVaR forecasts and to
compare and rank the performance of different RVaR models, tasks subsumed under
the term 'backtesting' in finance. The predictive performance is best evaluated
and compared in terms of strictly consistent loss or scoring functions. That
is, functions which are minimised in expectation by the correct RVaR forecast.
Much like ES, it has been shown recently that RVaR does not admit strictly
consistent scoring functions, i.e., it is not elicitable. Mitigating this
negative result, this paper shows that a triplet of RVaR with two VaR
components at different levels is elicitable. We characterise the class of
strictly consistent scoring functions for this triplet. Additional properties
of these scoring functions are examined, including the diagnostic tool of
Murphy diagrams. The results are illustrated with a simulation study, and we

literature review about the role of metallicity on the formation of exoplanets,
I also revisited most of the planet -- metallicity related correlations
reported in the literature using a large and homogeneous data provided by the
SWEET-Cat catalog. This study lead to several new results and conclusions, two
of which I believe deserve to be highlighted in the abstract: i) The hosts of
sub-Jupiter mass planets ($\sim$0.6 -- 0.9~M$_{\jupiter}$) are systematically
less metallic than the hosts of Jupiter-mass planets. This result might be
related to the longer disk lifetime and higher amount of planet building
materials available at high metallicities, which allow a formation of more
massive Jupiter-like planets. ii) Contrary to the previous claims, our data and
results do not support the existence of a breakpoint planetary mass at
4~M$_{\jupiter}$ above and below which planet formation channels are different.
However, the results also suggest that planets of the same (high) mass can be
formed through different channels depending on the (disk) stellar mass i.e.
environmental conditions.

A primary focus is to establish minimax optimality for statistical estimation
with the $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy constraint. To this end,
we find that classical lower bound arguments fail to yield sharp results, and
new technical tools are called for.
  By refining the ""tracing adversary"" technique for lower bounds in the

argument for minimax risks with differential privacy constraints, and apply
this argument to high-dimensional mean estimation and linear regression
problems. We also design computationally efficient algorithms that attain the
minimax lower bounds up to a logarithmic factor. In particular, for the
high-dimensional linear regression, a novel private iterative hard thresholding
pursuit algorithm is proposed, based on a privately truncated version of
stochastic gradient descent. The numerical performance of these algorithms is
demonstrated by simulation studies and applications to real data containing
sensitive information, for which privacy-preserving statistical methods are

  Jump Processes",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a new jump process modeling which involves a
particular kind of non-Gaussian stochastic processes with random jumps at
random time points. The main goal of this study is to provide an accurate
tracking technique based on non-linear non-stationary heteroscedasticity (NNH)
time series. It is, in fact, difficult to track jump processes regarding the
fact that non-Gaussianity is an inherent feature in these processes. The
proposed NNH model is conditionally Gaussian whose conditional variance is
time-varying. Therefore, we use Kalman filter for state tracking. We show
analytically that the proposed NNH model is superior to the traditional
methods. Furthermore, to validate the findings, simulations are performed.
Finally, the comparison between the proposed method and other alternatives
techniques has been made.

made of non-dispersive material, which not only singles out ""waveguide
dispersion"" but also motivates search of new materials to achieve guidance at
unconventional wavelengths. Performances of gold or silver chain waveguides are
then evaluated; a concise comparison of these two types of chain waveguides has
been previously missing. Beyond these singly-plasmonic chain waveguides, we
examine a hetero-plasmonic chain system with interlacing gold and silver
particles, inspired by a recent proposal; the claimed enhanced energy transfer
between gold particles appears to be a one-sided view of its hybridized
waveguiding behavior --- energy transfer between silver particles worsens.
Enabled by the versatile numerical method, we also discuss effects of
inter-particle spacing, background medium, and presence of a substrate. Our
extensive analyses show that the general route for reducing propagation loss of
e.g. a gold chain waveguide is to lower chain-mode frequency with a proper
geometry (e.g. smaller particle spacing) and background material setting (e.g.
high-permittivity background or even foreign nanoparticles). In addition, the
possibility of building mid-infrared chain waveguides using doped silicon is
commented based on numerical simulation.

the unintegrated gluon distribution (UGD), which describes the gluon emission
probability, with a given longitudinal momentum fraction and transverse

communication event is instantaneous and activates an undirected subgraph
spanning over a set of equally participating nodes. We present a probabilistic
framework to model and assess the communication volume observed at any single
node. Specifically, we employ non-parametric regression to learn the
probability that a node takes part in a certain event knowing the set of other
nodes that are involved. On the top of that, we present a concentration
inequality around the estimated volume of events in which a node could
participate, which in turn allows us to build an efficient and interpretable
anomaly scoring function. Finally, the superior performance of the proposed
approach is empirically demonstrated in real-world sensor network data, as well
as using synthetic communication activity that is in accordance with that
latter setting.

correlated materials that exhibit a metal-insulator transition. While the phase
transitions in these materials have been studied extensively, there is a
limited understanding of how the properties of these materials are affected by
the presence of defects and doping. In this study we investigate the impact of
native point defects in the form of Frenkel defects on the structural, magnetic
and electronic properties of VO$_2$ and V$_2$O$_3$, using first-principles
calculations. In VO$_2$ the vanadium Frenkel pairs lead to a non-trivial
insulating state. The unpaired vanadium interstitial bonds to a single dimer,
which leads to a trimer that has one singlet state and one localized
single-electron $S=1/2$ state. The unpaired broken dimer created by the
vanadium vacancy also has a localized $S=1/2$ state. Thus, the insulating state
is created by the singlet dimers, the trimer and the two localized $S=1/2$
states. Oxygen Frenkel pairs, on the other hand, lead to a metallic state in
VO$_2$, but are expected to be present in much lower concentrations. In
contrast, the Frenkel defects in V$_2$O$_3$ do not directly suppress the
insulating character of the material. However, the disorder created by defects
in V$_2$O$_3$ alters the local magnetic moments and in turn reduces the energy
cost of a transition between the insulating and conducting phases of the
material. We also find self-trapped small polarons in V$_2$O$_3$, which has
implications for transport properties in the insulating phase.

strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to
categorize relationships. Here we propose a set of dimensions that capture
major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic
literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. We first
review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting
dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. Next,
we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced
experiments. Ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be
used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support,
identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. These ten
dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing
models. Indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a
social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link
embeddedness method. We also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built
to collect data about how social media users perceive their online
relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. Overall, by
proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both

time-averaged flow behind a bluff body. This energy redistribution takes place
both in the vortex formation region and in the developed vortex wake. The
present paper focuses on studying the effect of the structure of a vortex
street on the intensity of energy redistribution. Two approaches are used. The
first one is direct numerical simulation of the flow behind a transversely
oscillating cylinder, which is known for a variety of vortex patterns in the
wake. The simulations are based on a finite element solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible perfect viscous gas. The second
approach is based on simplified point vortex models for infinite periodic
vortex streets, which contain a finite number of vortex chains in equilibrium.
It turns out that these simple models make it possible to obtain satisfactory
qualitative results, particularly if a more precise approximation of velocity
fields in the vortex cores (Rankine vortices) is implemented. It is shown that
the effect of energy redistribution significantly depends on the vortex
structure, namely the mutual arrangement of the vortices and their intensities.
The estimates of the energy separation efficiency in the time-averaged flow are
obtained for the general case of an arbitrary number of chains. A more detailed
analysis is performed for vortex streets with 2, 3, and 4 vortex chains.

partial expected accumulated weights, where paths not leading to a goal state

non-negative weights. Our main results are as follows. There are
polynomial-time algorithms to check the finiteness of the supremum of the
partial or conditional expectations in MDPs with arbitrary integer weights. If
finite, then optimal weight-based deterministic schedulers exist. In contrast
to the setting of non-negative weights, optimal schedulers can need infinite
memory and their value can be irrational. However, the optimal value can be
approximated up to an absolute error of $\epsilon$ in time exponential in the

on the pupil center. The boundary of the pupil is fitted with an ellipse and
the euclidean center of the ellipse in the image is taken as the center of the
pupil. However, the center of the pupil is generally not mapped to the center
of the ellipse by the projective camera transformation. This error resulting
from using a point that is not the true center of the pupil directly affects
eye tracking accuracy. We investigate the underlying geometric problem of
determining the center of a circular object based on its projective image. The
main idea is to exploit two concentric circles -- in the application scenario
these are the pupil and the iris. We show that it is possible to computed the
center and the ratio of the radii from the mapped concentric circles with a
direct method that is fast and robust in practice. We evaluate our method on
synthetically generated data and find that it improves systematically over
using the center of the fitted ellipse. Apart from applications of eye tracking
we estimate that our approach will be useful in other tracking applications.

in a theory surpassing classical general relativity are puzzling questions that
have generated a great deal of interest among various quantum gravity
approaches. In the context of loop quantum gravity (LQG), one of the major
candidates for a non-perturbative background-independent quantisation of
general relativity, considerable effort has been devoted to construct effective
models in which these questions can be studied. In these models, classical
singularities are replaced by a ""bounce"" induced by quantum geometry
corrections. Undesirable features may arise however depending on the details of
the model. In this paper, we focus on Schwarzschild black holes and propose a
new effective quantum theory based on polymerisation of new canonical phase
space variables inspired by those successful in loop quantum cosmology. The
quantum corrected spacetime resulting from the solutions of the effective
dynamics is characterised by infinitely many pairs of trapped and anti-trapped
regions connected via a space-like transition surface replacing the central
singularity. Quantum effects become relevant at a unique mass independent
curvature scale, while they become negligible in the low curvature region near
the horizon. The effective quantum metric describes also the exterior regions
and asymptotically classical Schwarzschild geometry is recovered. We however
find that physically acceptable solutions require us to select a certain subset
of initial conditions, corresponding to a specific mass (de-)amplification
after the bounce. We also sketch the corresponding quantum theory and
explicitly compute the kernel of the Hamiltonian constraint operator.

mixture of perfect fluids permeating the spacetime and studied the propagation

simulations that the timing residual of local pulsars should present a
distinguishable peak depending on the local value of the Hubble constant. As a
consequence, when assuming the standard LCDM model, our result predicts that
the region of maximum timing residual is determined by the redshift of the

is contemplated. Compared to the original conjecture, the modified condition
admits a broader class of low-energy effective theories such as those with
local maxima and/or false de Sitter vacua with some restrictions, as long as
there is an anti-de Sitter vacuum. The observed accelerating expansion of the
universe might therefore be attributed to a quintessence or a metastable
vacuum. The former solution can be simplified and thus better compatible with
phenomenological constraints thanks to the convexity of the effective
potential. Among the latter class of solutions is found the enthralling
possibility that the modified condition is in fact behind the experimentally

confirming and extending the result of Kawata et al. (2018a) thanks to the
greater reach of our spectro-photometric distance scale. However at l=118deg
the circular velocity rises outwards from R_G=10.5 kpc and there is a more
pronounced gradient in radial motion than is seen at l=178deg. Furthermore, the
A star radial motion differs from the F stars by ~10 km/s. We discuss our

evolution of high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs). No strong evolution
has been found out to z~6, implying that the type 1a supernova activity has
been already occurred in early universe. However, the trend of no evolution can
be caused by the sample selection bias since the previous studies have utilized
mostly very luminous AGNs, which may be already chemically matured at the
observed redshift. As motivated by the previously reported correlation between
AGN luminosity and metallicity, we investigate the FeII/MgII flux ratio over a
large dynamic range of luminosity, by adding a new sample of 12 quasars at z~3,
of which the lower luminosity limit is more than 1 dex smaller than that of the
previously studied high-z quasars. Based on the Gemini/GNIRS observations, we
find that the seven low-luminosity quasars with a mean bolometric luminosity
log L_bol~46.5 \pm 0.2 has an average FeII/MgII ratio of 0.68 \pm 0.11 dex.
This ratio is comparable to that of high-luminosity quasars (log L_bol~47.3 \pm

scenario is that the low-luminosity quasars in our sample are still relatively
luminous and already chemically matured. To search for chemically-young AGNs,

it is required to investigate much lower-luminosity AGNs.

hinted at a rich population of low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSBGs) fainter
than these limits, their formation remains poorly understood. We use
Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study how LSBGs, and
in particular the population of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs; mu > 24.5 mag
arcsec^-2), form and evolve over time. For M* > 10^8 MSun, LSBGs contribute 47,
7 and 6 per cent of the local number, mass and luminosity densities
respectively (~85/11/10 per cent for M* > 10^7 MSun). Today's LSBGs have
similar dark-matter fractions and angular momenta to high-surface-brightness
galaxies (HSBGs; mu < 23 mag arcsec^-2), but larger effective radii (x2.5 for
UDGs) and lower fractions of dense, star-forming gas (more than x6 less in UDGs
than HSBGs). LSBGs originate from the same progenitors as HSBGs at z > 2.
However, LSBG progenitors form stars more rapidly at early epochs. The higher
resultant rate of supernova-energy injection flattens their gas-density
profiles, which, in turn, creates shallower stellar profiles that are more
susceptible to tidal processes. After z ~ 1, tidal perturbations broaden LSBG
stellar distributions and heat their cold gas, creating the diffuse, largely
gas-poor LSBGs seen today. In clusters, ram-pressure stripping provides an
additional mechanism that assists in gas removal in LSBG progenitors. Our
results offer insights into the formation of a galaxy population that is
central to a complete understanding of galaxy evolution, and which will be a
key topic of research using new and forthcoming deep-wide surveys.

kicks may trigger EMRIs in galactic nuclei by scattering newborn stellar black
holes and neutron stars on extremely eccentric orbits; as a consequence, the
time-scale over which these compact objects are expected to inspiral onto the
central SMBH via GW emission may become shorter than the time-scale for other
orbital perturbations to occur. By applying this argument to the Galactic
Centre, we show that the S-cluster and the clockwise disc are optimal regions
for the generation of such events: one SN out of about 10 000 (100 000)
occurring in the S-cluster (clockwise disc) is expected to induce an EMRI. If
we assume that the natal kicks affecting stellar black holes are significantly
slower than those experienced by neutron stars, we find that most SN-driven
EMRIs involve neutron stars. We further estimate the time spanning from the SN
to the final plunge onto the SMBH to be of the order of few Myr. Finally, we
extrapolate the rate of SN-driven EMRIs per Milky Way to be up to 10^-8/yr,
thus we expect that LISA will detect up to a few tens of SN-driven EMRIs every
year.

for testing theories of gravity. Nevertheless, in spite of their growing
popularity as cosmological probes, a gap of knowledge between cosmic void
observations and theory still persists. In particular, the void size function
models proposed in literature have been proven unsuccessful in reproducing the
results obtained from cosmological simulations in which cosmic voids are
detected from biased tracers of the density field, undermining the possibility
of using them as cosmological probes. The goal of this work is to cover this

have improved the void selection procedure, presenting an algorithm that
redefines the void ridges and, consequently, their radius. By applying this
algorithm, we validate the volume conserving model of the void size function on
a set of unbiased simulated density field tracers. We highlight the difference
in the internal structure between voids selected in this way and those
identified by the popular VIDE void finder. We also extend the validation of
the model to the case of biased tracers. We find that a relation exists between
the tracer used to sample the underlying dark matter density field and its
unbiased counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate that, as long as this relation
is accounted for, the size function is a viable approach for studying cosmology
with cosmic voids.

of stellar neighbours can have a strong influence on a protoplanetary disc
(PPD) population. In particular, far ultraviolet (FUV) flux from massive stars
drives thermal winds from the outer edge of PPDs, accelerating disc
destruction. In this work, we present a novel technique for constraining the
dynamical history of a star forming environment using PPD properties in a
strongly FUV irradiated environment. Applying recent models for FUV induced
mass loss rates to the PPD population of Cygnus OB2, we constrain how long ago
primordial gas was expelled from the region; $ 0.5$ Myr ago if the Shakura &
Sunyaev $\alpha$-viscosity parameter is $\alpha = 10^{-2}$ (corresponding to a
viscous timescale of $\tau_\mathrm{visc} \approx 0.5$ Myr for a disc of scale
radius $40$ au around a $1\, M_\odot$ star). This value of $\alpha$ is
effectively an upper limit, since it assumes efficient extinction of FUV
photons throughout the embedded phase. With this gas expulsion timescale we are
able to produce a full dynamical model that fits kinematic and morphological
data as well as disc fractions. We suggest Cygnus OB2 was originally composed
of distinct massive clumps or filaments, each with a stellar mass $\sim 10^4 \,
M_\odot$. Finally we predict that in regions of efficient FUV induced mass
loss, disc mass $M_\mathrm{disc}$ as a function of stellar host mass
$m_\mathrm{star}$ follows a power law with $M_\mathrm{disc} \propto
m_\mathrm{star}^\beta$, where $\beta \gtrsim 2.7$ (depending on disc initial
conditions and FUV exposure). This is steeper than observed correlations in
regions of moderate FUV flux ($1 < \beta <1.9$), and offers a promising
diagnostic to establish the influence of external photoevaporation in a given
region.

galaxies often show lower star-formation efficiency (SFE) in their bar region
compared to the spiral arms. In this paper, we examine the relation between the
SFEs and the volume densities of molecular gas $n(\rm{H}_2)$ in the eight
different regions within the galactic disk with CO data combined with archival
far-ultraviolet and 24 $\mu$m data. We confirmed that SFE in the bar region is
lower by 39% than that in the spiral arms. Moreover, velocity-alignment
stacking analysis was performed for the spectra in the individual regions. The
integrated intensity ratios of $^{12}$CO to $^{13}$CO ($R_{12/13}$) range from
10 to 17 as the results of stacking. Fixing a kinetic temperature of molecular
gas, $n(\rm{H}_2)$ was derived from $R_{12/13}$ via non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (non-LTE) analysis. The density $n(\rm{H}_2)$ in the bar is lower
by 31-37% than that in the arms and there is a rather tight positive
correlation between SFEs and $n(\rm{H}_2)$, with a correlation coefficient of
$\sim 0.8$. Furthermore, we found a dependence of $n(\rm{H}_2)$ on the velocity
dispersion of inter-molecular clouds ($\Delta V/ \sin i$). Specifically,
$n(\rm{H}_2)$ increases as $\Delta V/ \sin i$ increases when $\Delta V/ \sin i
< 100$ km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, $n(\rm{H}_2)$ decreases as $\Delta V/
\sin i$ increases when $\Delta V/ \sin i > 100$ km s$^{-1}$. These relations
indicate that the variations of SFE could be caused by the volume densities of
molecular gas, and the volume densities could be governed by the dynamical
influence such as cloud-cloud collisions, shear and enhanced inner-cloud
turbulence.

Fermi energy $E_F$ and the bound state energy for two fermions in a vacuum,
$E_0$. BCS and BEC limits correspond to $E_F \gg E_0$ and $E_F \ll E_0$,
respectively. The chemical potential $\mu = E_F-E_0$ changes the sign between
the two regimes. We develop an approach to derive the leading terms in the
expansion of the effective action in the spatial and time derivative of the
slowly varying superconducting order parameter $\Delta (r, \tau)$, and express
the action in terms of derivatives of the phase $\phi (r,\tau)$ of $\Delta (r,
\tau) = \Delta e^{i\phi (r, \tau)}$. In the long wavelength limit the second
gradients $(\nabla \phi)^2$ and ${\dot \phi}^2$, describe Bogoliubov-Anderson
mode, which, as we find, does not change through BCS-BEC crossover. The
effective action also contains first order gradient term, $i \pi A {\dot
\phi}$, which is meaningful only if $\phi$ contains topological defects, such
as vortices. We apply our approach to evaluate coefficient $A$ for a moving
vortex. We find that $A_{vort}$ has two contributions, $A_{vort}= A_{vort,1} -
A_{vort,2}$. One comes from the states away from the vortex core and has
$A_{vort,1} = n/2$, where $n$ is the fermion density. The other comes from
electronic states inside the vortex core and has $A_{vort,2} = -n_0/2$, where
$n_0$ is the fermion density at the vortex core. We interpret this term as the
reaction force of normal electrons to the vortex displacement in the limit when
the spacing between energy levels is set to zero. The difference $(n-n_0)/2$
changes through the BEC-BCS crossover as $n_0$ nearly compensates $n$ in the
BCS regime, but vanishes in the BEC regime.

to be caused by random fluctuation. We show that Fornax 6 is a star cluster
with a peculiarly low surface brightness and irregular shape, which may
indicate a strong tidal influence from its host galaxy. The Hess diagram of
Fornax 6 is largely consistent with that of Fornax field stars, but it appears
to be slightly bluer. However, it is still likely more metal-rich than most of
the globular clusters in the system. Faint clusters like Fornax 6 that orbit
and potentially get disrupted in the centers of dwarf galaxies can prove
crucial for constraining the dark matter distribution in Milky Way satellites.

critical point in two dimensions are of both theoretical and experimental
interest. In this work, we derive a kinetic equation valid in a broad regime
near the quantum critical point using the memory matrix approach. The formalism
is applied to study the effect of the critical fluctuations on the dc
resistivity through different scattering mechanisms, including umklapp,
impurity scattering, and electron-hole scattering in a compensated metal. We
show that electrical transport in the quantum critical regime exhibits a rich
behavior that depends sensitively on the scattering mechanism and the band
structure. In the case of a single large Fermi surface, the resistivity due to
umklapp scattering crosses over from $\rho\sim T^2$ at low temperature to
sublinear at high temperature. The crossover temperature scales as $q_0^3$,
where $q_0$ is the minimal wavevector for umklapp scattering. Impurity
scattering leads to $\rho-\rho_0\sim T^\alpha$ ($\rho_0$ being the residual
resistivity), where $\alpha$ is either larger than 2 if there is only a single
Fermi sheet present, or 4/3 in the case of multiple Fermi sheets. Finally, in a
perfectly compensated metal with an equal density of electrons and holes, the
low temperature behavior depends strongly on the structure of ""cold spots"" on
the Fermi surface, where the coupling between the quasiparticles and order
parameter fluctuations vanishes by symmetry. In particular, for a system where
cold spots are present on some (but not all) Fermi sheets, $\rho\sim T^{5/3}$.
At higher temperatures there is a broad crossover regime where $\rho$ either
saturates or $\rho\sim T$, depending on microscopic details. We discuss these
results in the context of recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a metallic
Ising nematic critical point, and experiments in certain iron-based
superconductors.

giant planets within the lifetime of the protoplanetary disc gas-phase. The
core grows via this process until the protoplanet reaches its pebble isolation
mass and starts to accrete gas. During the growth, the protoplanet undergoes a
rapid, large-scale, inward migration due to the interactions with the gaseous
protoplanetary disc. In our work, we investigate how this early migration would
have affected the minor body populations in our solar system. In particular, we
focus on the Jupiter Trojans and the Hildas asteroids. We found that a massive
and eccentric Hilda group is captured during the migration from a region
between 5 and 8 au and subsequently depleted during the late instability of the
giant planets. Our simulations also show that inward migration of the giant
planets always produces a Jupiter Trojans' leading swarm more populated than
the trailing one, with a ratio comparable to the current observed Trojan
asymmetry ratio. The in situ formation of Jupiter, on the other hand, produces
symmetric leading/trailing swarms. The reason for the asymmetry is the relative
drift between the migrating planet and the particles in the coorbital
resonance. The capture happens during the growth of Jupiter's core and Trojan
asteroids are afterwards carried along during the giant planet's migration to
their final orbits. The asymmetry and eccentricity of the captured Trojans
correspond well to observations, but their inclinations are near zero and their
total mass is 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than the current population.
Future modelling will be needed to understand whether the dynamical evolution
of the Trojans over billions of years will raise the inclinations and deplete
the masses to observed values.

their provable gains in reducing the cost of data delivery in wireless
networks. These gains, however, have only been demonstrated under the
assumption of a free placement phase. This unrealistic assumption poses a
significant limitation, especially in cases where aggressive placement
strategies can lead to a significant transmission cost that may even be higher
than the corresponding cost of the delivery phase. In this paper, we relax this
assumption and propose a general caching framework that captures the
transmission cost of the two phases, and hence, results in minimizing the
overall rate of the caching network. We model the dynamic nature of the network
through a cost structure that allows for varying the network architecture and
cost per transmission, across the placement and delivery phases. We start with
the scenario where the individual users have no limit on the available caching
memory and characterize the jointly optimal solution as a function of the
different parameters in our cost structure. Then, we characterize the effect of
memory constraints on the optimal solution in certain special cases.
Interestingly, our results identify regions where the uncoded caching scheme
outperforms its coded counterpart. Further, coded caching is shown to offer
performance gains only when the network architecture during the placement phase
is different from that during the delivery phase.

latent structure in a single dataset. In many applications, however, we are
interested in modeling latent structure and variation that are enriched in a
target dataset compared to some background---e.g. enriched in patients compared
to the general population. Contrastive learning is a principled framework to
capture such enriched variation between the target and background, but
state-of-the-art contrastive methods are limited to linear models. In this
paper, we introduce the contrastive variational autoencoder (cVAE), which
combines the benefits of contrastive learning with the power of deep generative
models. The cVAE is designed to identify and enhance salient latent features.
The cVAE is trained on two related but unpaired datasets, one of which has
minimal contribution from the salient latent features. The cVAE explicitly
models latent features that are shared between the datasets, as well as those
that are enriched in one dataset relative to the other, which allows the
algorithm to isolate and enhance the salient latent features. The algorithm is
straightforward to implement, has a similar run-time to the standard VAE, and
is robust to noise and dataset purity. We conduct experiments across diverse
types of data, including gene expression and facial images, showing that the
cVAE effectively uncovers latent structure that is salient in a particular
analysis.

detonation waves were obtained at the macro-scale, with cellular structures
characterized by reactive transverse waves. For all the mixtures studied, the
dependence of the mean detonation speed was found to be in excellent agreement
with first principles predictions of quasi-1D detonation dynamics with lateral
strain rate predicted from detailed chemical kinetic models. This excellent
agreement departs from the earlier experiments of Radulescu and Borzou (2018)

longer reaction zone lengths of argon diluted hydrogen-oxygen detonations at
low pressures, as compared with the characteristic induction zone lengths.
While the cellular instability modifies the detonation induction zone, the
detonation dynamics at the macro-scale are arguably controlled by its
hydrodynamic thickness. Near the limit, minor discrepancy is observed, with the
experimental detonations typically continuing to propagate to slightly higher

for the mass loss in a wind leads to an increase of the magnetospheric radius.
Our model may be applied to a large variety of magnetized neutron stars
accreting close to or above their Eddington limits: ultra-luminous X-ray
pulsars, Be/X-ray binaries in outbursts, and other systems. In the context of
our model we discuss the observational properties of NGC 5907~X-1, the
brightest ultra-luminous pulsar known so far, and NGC 300~ULX-1 which is
apparently a Be/X-ray binary experiencing a very bright super-Eddington

  Applications",,,,,"cs.DC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GPU computing is becoming increasingly more popular with the proliferation of
deep learning (DL) applications. However, unlike traditional resources such as
CPU or the network, modern GPUs do not natively support fine-grained sharing
primitives. Consequently, implementing common policies such as time sharing and
preemption are expensive. Worse, when a DL application cannot completely use a
GPU's resources, the GPU cannot be efficiently shared between multiple
applications, leading to GPU underutilization.
  We present Salus to enable two GPU sharing primitives: fast job switching and
memory sharing, in order to achieve fine-grained GPU sharing among multiple DL
applications. Salus implements an efficient, consolidated execution service
that exposes the GPU to different DL applications, and enforces fine-grained
sharing by performing iteration scheduling and addressing associated memory
management issues. We show that these primitives can then be used to implement
flexible sharing policies such as fairness, prioritization, and packing for
various use cases. Our integration of Salus with TensorFlow and evaluation on
popular DL jobs show that Salus can improve the average completion time of DL
training jobs by $3.19\times$, GPU utilization for hyper-parameter tuning by
$2.38\times$, and GPU utilization of DL inference applications by $42\times$
over not sharing the GPU and $7\times$ over NVIDIA MPS with small overhead.

The mechanisms governing the opening of cavities in transition disks
are not fully understood. Several processes have been proposed but their
occurrence rate is still unknown. Aims. We present spatially resolved
observations of two transition disks and aim at constraining their vertical and
radial structure using multiwavelength observations. Methods. We have obtained
near-IR scattered light observations with VLT/SPHERE of the transition disks
J1608 and J1852. We complement our datasets with ALMA observations and with
unresolved photometric observations covering a wide range of wavelengths. We
performed radiative transfer modeling to analyze the morphology of the disks
and compare the results with a sample of 20 other transition disks observed
with both SPHERE and ALMA. Results. The scattered light image of J1608 reveals
a very inclined disk, with two bright lobes and a large cavity. J1852 shows an
inner ring extending beyond the coronagraphic radius up to 15au, a gap and a
second ring at 42au. Our radiative transfer model of J1608 indicates that the
millimeter-sized grains are less extended vertically and radially than the
micron-sized grains, indicating advanced settling and radial drift. We find
good agreement with the observations of J1852 with a similar model, but due to
the low inclination of the system, the model remains partly degenerate. The
analysis of 22 transition disks shows that, in general, the cavities observed
in scattered light are smaller than the ones detected at millimeter
wavelengths. Conclusions. The analysis of a sample of transition disks
indicates that the small grains can flow inward of the region where millimeter
grains are trapped. While 15 out of the 22 cavities in our sample could be
explained by a planet of less than 13 Jupiter masses, the others either require
the presence of a more massive companion or of several low-mass planets.

the crust does have an effect on the inferred radius. We predict the systematic

the prediction to results from full parameter estimation runs. For GW170817,
this systematic error affects the radius estimate by 0.3 km, approximately

control problems -- such as locomotion and manipulation -- often results in
policies which rely on high-amplitude, high-frequency control signals, known
colloquially as bang-bang control. Although such solutions may indeed maximize
task reward, they can be unsuitable for real world systems. Bang-bang control
may lead to increased wear and tear or energy consumption, and tends to excite
undesired second-order dynamics. To counteract this issue, multi-objective
optimization can be used to simultaneously optimize both the reward and some
auxiliary cost that discourages undesired (e.g. high-amplitude) control. In
principle, such an approach can yield the sought after, smooth, control
policies. It can, however, be hard to find the correct trade-off between cost
and return that results in the desired behavior. In this paper we propose a new
constraint-based reinforcement learning approach that ensures task success
while minimizing one or more auxiliary costs (such as control effort). We
employ Lagrangian relaxation to learn both (a) the parameters of a control
policy that satisfies the desired constraints and (b) the Lagrangian
multipliers for the optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate that we can satisfy
constraints either in expectation or in a per-step fashion, and can even learn
a single policy that is able to dynamically trade-off between return and cost.

target-machines equipped with the latest release of a software control system.
When testing industrial robots, it is common that the target machines need to
share some common resources, e.g., costly hardware devices, and so there is a
need to schedule test case execution on the target machines, accounting for
these shared resources. With a large number of such tests executed on a regular
basis, this scheduling becomes difficult to manage manually. In fact, with
manual test execution planning and scheduling, some robots may remain
unoccupied for long periods of time and some test cases may not be executed.
This paper introduces TC-Sched, a time-aware method for automated test case
execution scheduling. TC-Sched uses Constraint Programming to schedule tests to
run on multiple machines constrained by the tests' access to shared resources,
such as measurement or networking devices. The CP model is written in SICStus
Prolog and uses the Cumulatives global constraint. Given a set of test cases, a
set of machines, and a set of shared resources, TC-Sched produces an execution
schedule where each test is executed once with minimal time between when a
source code change is committed and the test results are reported to the
developer. Experiments reveal that TC-Sched can schedule 500 test cases over
100 machines in less than 4 minutes for 99.5% of the instances. In addition,
TC-Sched largely outperforms simpler methods based on a greedy algorithm and is
suitable for deployment on industrial robot testing.

employed, which include the size effect by Bikerman model and solvation energy
by Born model. The selectivity of KcsA for various ions (K$^+$, Na$^+$, Cl$^-$,
Ca$^{2+}$ and Ba$^{2+}$) is studied analytically, and the profiles of
concentrations and electric potential are provided. The selectivity is mainly
influenced by permanent negative charges in filter of channel and the ion
sizes. K$^+$ is always selected compared with Na$^+$ (or Cl$^-$), as smaller
ion size of Na$^+$ causes larger solvation energy. There is a transition for
selectivity among K$^+$ and divalent ions (Ca$^{2+}$ and Ba$^{2+}$), when
negative charge in filter exceeds a critical value determined by ion size. This
explains why divalent ions can block the KcsA channel. The profiles and IV
relations are studied by analytical, numerical and hybrid methods, and are
cross-validated. The results show the selectivity of the channel and also the
saturation of IV curve. A simple strategy is given to compute IV relations
analytically, as first approximation. The numerical method deals with general

simulation are also pointed out. The hybrid method provides IV relations most

research. In the optical, scattered moonlight dominates the sky background,

Cerro Paranal uses an extrapolated aerosol extinction curve. With a set of
X-Shooter sky observations, we have tested the current model as well as
determined the aerosol extinction from the ultra-violet to near-infrared. To
our knowledge, this is the first time that a scattered moonlight model has been
used for this purpose. These observations were taken of blank sky, during three
different lunar phases, and at six different angular distances from the moon
for each night/lunar phase. Overall, the current model does reproduce the
observations for average conditions decently well. Using a set of sky
background models with varying aerosol distributions to compare with the
observations, we found the most likely aerosol extinction curves, phase
functions, and volume densities for the three nights of observations and
compare them with the current model. While there were some degeneracies in the
aerosol scattering properties, the extinction curves tend to flatten towards
redder wavelengths and are overall less steep compared to the extrapolated
curve used in the current model. Also, the current model had significantly less
coarse particles compared to the favored volume densities from the X-Shooter
data. For the three nights of sky observations, the aerosol size distributions
differed, most likely reflecting the changes in atmospheric conditions and
aerosol content. In short, the current sky background model is in fair
agreement with the observations, and we have determined better aerosol
extinction curves and phase functions for Cerro Paranal.

  The lack of dense memory technology restricts the use of superconducting
technology in the near term to application domains that have high compute

the energy efficiency to 12.2X. We also investigate solutions to make the
accelerator tolerant of new fault modes and show how this fault-tolerant design
can be leveraged to reduce the operating current, thereby increasing the
overall energy-efficiency to 46X compared to CMOS. Our paper also develops a
workflow for evaluating area, performance, and power for accelerators built in

Algebraic effects represent impure behaviour in a functional programming
language, such as input and output, exceptions, nondeterminism etc. all treated
in a generic way. Program equivalence aims to identify which programs can be
considered equal in some sense. This question has been studied for a long time
but has only recently been extended to languages with algebraic effects, which
are a newer development. Much work remains to be done in order to understand
program equivalence in the presence of algebraic effects. In particular, there
is no characterisation of contextual equivalence using a logic. We define a
logic whose formulas express properties of higher-order programs with algebraic
effects. We then investigate three notions of program equivalence for algebraic
effects: logical equivalence induced by the aforementioned logic, applicative
bisimilarity and contextual equivalence. For the programming language used in
this dissertation, we prove that they all coincide. Therefore, the main novel
contribution of the dissertation is defining the first logic for algebraic
effects whose induced program equivalence coincides with contextual
equivalence.

intervals. In this work, we propose a new family of MSMs to address these two

a weighted tensor completion problem as our estimation procedure, and show that
the solution to this problem converges to the true model in an appropriate

order parameters with imprinted phases are utilized to generate different
initial arrays of solitons, for which the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation is numerically solved. Given that the soliton velocity is conserved
due to the lack of dissipation, we are able to apply a simple quasiparticle
description of the soliton dynamics. In fact, the trajectory equations are
written in terms of the velocities and the angular shifts produced at each
collision, in analogy to the infinite one-dimensional system. To calculate the
angular shifts, we directly extract them from the trajectories given by the
Gross-Pitaevskii simulations and, on the other hand, we show that accurate
values can be analytically obtained by adapting a formula valid for the
infinite one-dimensional system that involves the healing length, which in our
inhomogeneous system must be evaluated in terms of the sound velocity along the
azimuthal direction. We further show that very good estimates of such a sound
velocity can be directly determined by using the ground state density profile

key importance to a range of topics. To describe these phenomena, the two-layer
shallow-water equations is commonly employed. When one layer is significantly
deeper than the other, it is common to approximate the system with the much
simpler one-layer shallow water equations. So far, it has been assumed that
this approximation is invalid near shocks, and one has applied additional front
conditions for the shock speed. In this paper, we prove mathematically that an
effective one-layer model can be derived from the two-layer equations that
correctly captures the behaviour of shocks and contact discontinuities without
any additional closure relations. The proof yields a novel formulation of an
effective one-layer shallow water model. The result shows that simplification
to an effective one-layer model is well justified mathematically and can be
made without additional knowledge of the shock behaviour. The shock speed in
the proposed model is consistent with empirical models and identical to the
front conditions that have been found theoretically by e.g. von K\'arm\'an and
by Benjamin. This suggests that the breakdown of the shallow-water equations in
the vicinity of shocks is less severe than previously thought. We further
investigate the applicability of the shallow water framework to shocks by
studying shocks in one-dimensional lock-exchange/lock-release. We derive
expressions for the Froude number that are in good agreement with the widely
employed expression by Benjamin. We then solve the equations numerically to
illustrate how quickly the proposed model converges to solutions of the full
two-layer shallow-water equations. We also compare numerical results using our

communication purposes, has recently emerged as either an alternative or a
support system for radio frequency (RF) communication. VLC channel inside a
room is highly variable since it is pretty much depends on optical line of
sight (LOS) and field of view (FOV) and it causes the received signal to vary
dramatically. Therefore, to achieve spectral efficient communication, using
rate adaptation methods are essential. In this study, we propose a rateless
codes based rate adaptation method which adjusts transmission rate at receiver
side and does not require channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter
side. Spectral efficiency of proposed method is analyzed and compared with
adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) rate adaptation method widely used in
literature. For simulation work, we consider a realistic communication system
model by using commercially available LEDs and also fulfilling illumination
requirements. To overcome multi-path effects, optical orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is used. Simulation results indicate
that proposed rate adaptive method can achieve seamless rate adaptation and has
higher spectral efficiency compared to AMC in presence of significant signal
quality variations caused by mobility in a model room.

associated to these three distances are all different, but they are all
attained by the sample average. Furthermore, we show that the latter is
adaptive to the possible sparsity of the unknown vector. Some numerical

their host galaxies are correlated through scaling relations. While
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations have begun to account for the
co-evolution of BHs and galaxies, they typically have neglected the BH spin,
even though it may play an important role in modulating the growth and feedback
of BHs. Here we introduce a new sub-grid model for the BH spin evolution in the
moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} in order to improve the physical faithfulness
of the BH modelling in galaxy formation simulations. We account for several
different channels of spin evolution, in particular gas accretion through a
Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$-disc, chaotic accretion, and BH mergers. For BH
feedback, we extend the IllustrisTNG model, which considers two different BH
feedback modes, a thermal quasar mode for high accretion states and a kinetic
mode for low Eddington ratios, with a self-consistent accounting of
spin-dependent radiative efficiencies and thus feedback strength. We find that
BHs with mass $M_{\rm{bh}}\lesssim 10^{8}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ reach high spin
values as they typically evolve in the coherent gas accretion regime. On the
other hand, BHs with mass $M_{\rm{bh}}\gtrsim 10^{8}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ have
lower spins as BH mergers become more frequent, and their accretion discs
fragment due to self-gravity, inducing chaotic accretion. We also explore the
hypothesis that the transition between the quasar and kinetic feedback modes is
mediated by the accretion mode of the BH disc itself, i.e.~the kinetic feedback
mode is activated when the disc enters the self-gravity regime. We find
excellent agreement between the galaxy and BH populations for this approach and
the fiducial TNG model with no spin evolution. Furthermore, our new approach
alleviates a tension in the galaxy morphology -- colour relation of the
original TNG model.

estimation is based on the internal model principle leading to an overall
observer system consisting of parallelized mSOGIs. The observer is tuned by
pole placement. For a constant fundamental frequency, the observer is capable
of estimating all harmonic components with prescribed settling time by choosing
the observer poles appropriately. For time-varying fundamental frequencies, the
harmonic estimation is combined with a modified Frequency Locked Loop (mFLL)
with gain normalization, sign-correct anti-windup and rate limitation. The
estimation performances of the proposed parallelized mSOGIs with and without

Here, we address the need for high repetition rate targets and optics through

flow channels that harbor the chromospheric inverse Evershed effect (IEF) near
their downflow points (DFPs) in the sunspot's penumbra. The azimuth and
inclination of the IEF channels to the line of sight (LOS) were derived from
spatial maps of the LOS velocity and line-core intensity of the \ion{Ca}{ii} IR
line and a thermal inversion of the \ion{Ca}{ii} IR spectra to obtain
temperature cubes. We find that the flow direction of the IEF near the DFPs is
aligned with the photospheric magnetic field to within about $\pm$\,15\,deg.
The IEF flow fibrils make an angle of 30--90\,deg to the local vertical with an
average value of about 65\,deg. The average field strength at the DFPs is about
1.3\,kG. Our findings suggest that the IEF in the lower chromosphere is a
field-aligned siphon flow, where the larger field strength at the inner
footpoints together with the lower temperature in the penumbra causes the
necessary gas pressure difference relative to the outer footpoints in the
hotter quiet Sun with lower magnetic field strength. The IEF connects to
magnetic field lines that are not horizontal like for the regular photospheric
Evershed flow, but which continue upwards into the chromosphere indicating an

to systems whose Hamiltonian is separable into a kinetic and potential terms.
Here, we describe several implicit geometric integrators applicable to both
separable and non-separable Hamiltonians, and, in particular, to the
nonadiabatic molecular Hamiltonian in the adiabatic representation. These
integrators combine the dynamic Fourier method with recursive symmetric
composition of the trapezoidal rule or implicit midpoint method, which results
in an arbitrary order of accuracy in the time step. Moreover, these integrators
are exactly unitary, symplectic, symmetric, time-reversible, and stable, and,
in contrast to the split-operator algorithm, conserve energy exactly,
regardless of the accuracy of the solution. The order of convergence and
conservation of geometric properties are proven analytically and demonstrated
numerically on a two-surface NaI model in the adiabatic representation.
Although each step of the higher order integrators is more costly, these
algorithms become the most efficient ones if higher accuracy is desired; a
thousand-fold speedup compared to the second-order trapezoidal rule (the
Crank-Nicolson method) was observed for wavefunction convergence error of

were based on considering stationary flows in periodic channels. Here, we take
an alternative approach and consider non-steady state single particle diffusion
in an open periodic channel. The approach allows us to express $D(x)$ as a
series of terms of increasing powers of $\epsilon$ - a parameter associated
with the aspect ratio of the channel. When the expansion is truncated at the
leading term, we recover the expression suggested by Zwanzig [J. Phys. Chem.
{\bf 96}, 3926 (1992)] for $D(x)$. Furthermore, comparison of the first few
terms in our expansion for $D(x)$ with the one proposed by Kalinay and Percus
[Phys. Rev. E {\bf 74}, 041203 (2006)] shows that they are consistent with each
other. In the limit of long wavelength channels ($\epsilon\ll 1$), the
expansion converges rapidly and the leading approximation provides a very
accurate description of the two-dimensional dynamics. For short wavelength
channels, the expansion does not converge and the validity of the effective
one-dimensional description is questionable.

entropy production, respectively. The routine receives as inputs energy fluxes
at surface and at the Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA), for the computation of energy
budgets at Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA), at the surface, and in the atmosphere as a
residual. Meridional enthalpy transports are also computed from the divergence
of the zonal mean energy budget fluxes; location and intensity of peaks in the
two hemispheres are then provided as outputs. Rainfall, snowfall and latent
heat fluxes are received as inputs for computing the water mass and latent
energy budgets. If a land-sea mask is provided, the required quantities are
separately computed over continents and oceans. The diagnostic tool also
computes the Lorenz Energy Cycle (LEC) and its storage/conversion terms as
annual mean global and hemispheric values. In order to achieve this, one needs
to provide as input three-dimensional daily fields of horizontal wind velocity
and temperature in the troposphere. Two methods have been implemented for the
computation of the material entropy production, one relying on the convergence
of radiative heat fluxes in the atmosphere (indirect method), one combining the
irreversible processes occurring in the climate system, particularly heat
fluxes in the boundary layer, the hydrological cycle and the kinetic energy
dissipation as retrieved from the residuals of the LEC. A version of the

acceleration level which do not cover all the possible acceleration
quintessence. In contrast, the multiple model (MM) algorithms that take care of
some IE's shortcomings, are sensitive to the transition probability matrices.
In this paper, an innovative model is proposed to overcome these drawbacks by
using a new generalized dynamic modeling of acceleration and a Bayesian filter.
We utilize SDE to model Markovian jump acceleration of a maneuvering target
through GARCH process as the SDE volatility. In the proposed scheme, the
original state and stochastic volatility (SV) are estimated simultaneously by a
bootstrap particle filter (PF). We introduce the bootstrap resampling to obtain
the statistical properties of a GARCH density. Due to the heavy-tailed nature
of the GARCH distribution, the bootstrap PF is more effective in the presence
of large errors that can occur in the state equation. We show analytically that
the target tracking performance is improved by considering GARCH acceleration

  Minimax Perspective",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Biased stochastic estimators, such as finite-differences for noisy gradient
estimation, often contain parameters that need to be properly chosen to balance
impacts from the bias and the variance. While the optimal order of these
parameters in terms of the simulation budget can be readily established, the
precise best values depend on model characteristics that are typically unknown
in advance. We introduce a framework to construct new classes of estimators,
based on judicious combinations of simulation runs on sequences of tuning
parameter values, such that the estimators consistently outperform a given
tuning parameter choice in the conventional approach, regardless of the unknown
model characteristics. We argue the outperformance via what we call the
asymptotic minimax risk ratio, obtained by minimizing the worst-case asymptotic
ratio between the mean square errors of our estimators and the conventional
one, where the worst case is over any possible values of the model unknowns. In
particular, when the minimax ratio is less than 1, the calibrated estimator is
guaranteed to perform better asymptotically. We identify this minimax ratio for
general classes of weighted estimators, and the regimes where this ratio is
less than 1. Moreover, we show that the best weighting scheme is characterized
by a sum of two components with distinct decay rates. We explain how this
arises from bias-variance balancing that combats the adversarial selection of
the model constants, which can be analyzed via a tractable reformulation of a
non-convex optimization problem.

regime where the parameters of the model exceed the size of the training
dataset. Sufficiently overparameterized neural network architectures in
principle have the capacity to fit any set of labels including random noise.
However, given the highly nonconvex nature of the training landscape it is not
clear what level and kind of overparameterization is required for first order
methods to converge to a global optima that perfectly interpolate any labels. A
number of recent theoretical works have shown that for very wide neural
networks where the number of hidden units is polynomially large in the size of
the training data gradient descent starting from a random initialization does
indeed converge to a global optima. However, in practice much more moderate
levels of overparameterization seems to be sufficient and in many cases
overparameterized models seem to perfectly interpolate the training data as
soon as the number of parameters exceed the size of the training data by a
constant factor. Thus there is a huge gap between the existing theoretical
literature and practical experiments. In this paper we take a step towards
closing this gap. Focusing on shallow neural nets and smooth activations, we
show that (stochastic) gradient descent when initialized at random converges at
a geometric rate to a nearby global optima as soon as the square-root of the
number of network parameters exceeds the size of the training data. Our results
also benefit from a fast convergence rate and continue to hold for
non-differentiable activations such as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs).

architecture with dynamic subarrays, where each radio frequency (RF) chain is
connected to a dynamic subset of antennas. We consider the design of analog and
digital precoders utilizing statistical and/or mixed channel state information
(CSI), which involve solving an extremely difficult problem in theory: First,
designing the optimal partition of antennas over RF chains is a combinatorial
optimization problem, whose optimal solution requires an exhaustive search over
all antenna partitioning solutions; Second, the average mutual information
under mmWave MIMO channels lacks closed-form expression and involves
prohibitive computational burden; Third, the hybrid precoding problem with
given partition of antennas is nonconvex with respect to the analog and digital
precoders. To address these issues, this study first presents a simple
criterion and the corresponding low complexity algorithm to design the optimal
partition of antennas using statistical CSI. Then it derives the lower bound
and its approximation for the average mutual information, in which the
computational complexity is greatly reduced compared to calculating the average
mutual information directly. In addition, it also shows that the lower bound
with a constant shift offers a very accurate approximation to the average
mutual information. This paper further proposes utilizing the lower bound

superpositions of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. Revealing this quantized
structure is only possible with an apparatus that measures the mechanical
energy with a precision greater than the energy of a single phonon,
$\hbar\omega_\text{m}$. One way to achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a
strong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator and an atom. In a
system with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to
distinguish different phonon number states by resolvable differences in the
atom's transition frequency. Such dispersive measurements have been studied in
cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics where experiments using real and
artificial atoms have resolved the photon number states of cavities. Here, we
report an experiment where an artificial atom senses the motional energy of a
driven nanomechanical oscillator with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the
quantization of its energy. To realize this, we build a hybrid platform that
integrates nanomechanical piezoelectric resonators with a microwave
superconducting qubit on the same chip. We excite phonons with resonant pulses
of varying amplitude and probe the resulting excitation spectrum of the qubit
to observe phonon-number-dependent frequency shifts $\approx 5$ times larger

with three jets identified as initiated by bottom quarks and corresponds to
$5.4~\text{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. In each event, the invariant

forensic similarity, which determines whether two image patches contain the
same forensic trace or different forensic traces. One benefit of this approach
is that prior knowledge, e.g. training samples, of a forensic trace are not
required to make a forensic similarity decision on it in the future. To do
this, we propose a two part deep-learning system composed of a CNN-based
feature extractor and a three-layer neural network, called the similarity
network. This system maps pairs of image patches to a score indicating whether
they contain the same or different forensic traces. We evaluated system
accuracy of determining whether two image patches were 1) captured by the same
or different camera model, 2) manipulated by the same or different editing
operation, and 3) manipulated by the same or different manipulation parameter,
given a particular editing operation. Experiments demonstrate applicability to
a variety of forensic traces, and importantly show efficacy on ""unknown""
forensic traces that were not used to train the system. Experiments also show
that the proposed system significantly improves upon prior art, reducing error
rates by more than half. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of the
forensic similarity approach in two practical applications: forgery detection
and localization, and database consistency verification.

finding $\epsilon$-stationary points ($\| \nabla F(x) \| \leq\epsilon$) in

both the local stochastic oracle model and the global oracle (or, statistical
learning) model. This allows us to decompose the complexity of finding
near-stationary points into optimization complexity and sample complexity, and
reveals some surprising differences between the complexity of stochastic
optimization versus learning. Notably, we show that in the global
oracle/statistical learning model, only logarithmic dependence on smoothness is
required to find a near-stationary point, whereas polynomial dependence on
smoothness is necessary in the local stochastic oracle model. In other words,
the separation in complexity between the two models can be exponential, and
that the folklore understanding that smoothness is required to find stationary
points is only weakly true for statistical learning.
  Our upper bounds are based on extensions of a recent ""recursive
regularization"" technique proposed by Allen-Zhu (2018). We show how to extend
the technique to achieve near-optimal rates, and in particular show how to
leverage the extra information available in the global oracle model. Our
algorithm for the global model can be implemented efficiently through finite

possible way of fulfilling the machine learning task while preserving user
privacy is to train the model on a transformed, noisy version of the data,
which does not reveal the data itself directly to the training procedure. In
this work, we analyze the privacy-utility trade-off of two such schemes for the
problem of linear regression: additive noise, and random projections. In
contrast to previous work, we consider a recently proposed notion of
differential privacy that is based on conditional mutual information (MI-DP),
which is stronger than the conventional $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential
privacy, and use relative objective error as the utility metric. We find that
projecting the data to a lower-dimensional subspace before adding noise attains
a better trade-off in general. We also make a connection between privacy

Based on an overlapping dual partition, the one-sided flux is approximated by

with vertex-centered unknowns is obtained by a new two-point flux technique,
which avoids the convex decomposition of co-normals and the introduction of
intermediate unknowns. The existence of a solution is proved for this nonlinear
system by applying the Brouwer's theorem. Numerical results show that the
proposed positivity-preserving scheme is effective on distorted quadrilateral

The
conventional wisdom to this end is by reducing through training a statistical
distance (such as $f$-divergence) between the generated distribution and
provided data distribution. But this is more of a heuristic than a guarantee.
The statistical distance measures a $\textit{global}$, but not
$\textit{local}$, similarity between two distributions. Even if it is small, it
does not imply a plausible mode coverage. Rethinking this problem from a
game-theoretic perspective, we show that a complete mode coverage is firmly
attainable. If a generative model can approximate a data distribution
moderately well under a global statistical distance measure, then we will be
able to find a mixture of generators that collectively covers $\textit{every}$
data point and thus $\textit{every}$ mode, with a lower-bounded generation
probability. Constructing the generator mixture has a connection to the
multiplicative weights update rule, upon which we propose our algorithm. We
prove that our algorithm guarantees complete mode coverage. And our experiments

the identity function reliably from 60k examples. Deeper CNNs often fail, but
nonetheless do astonishing work to memorize the training output: because CNN

error and a difference of description lengths of the training data; we call
this difference differential description length (DDL). This allows prediction
of generalization error from the training data alone by performing encoding of
the training data. DDL can then be used for model selection by choosing the

network sampling models, where the probability of sampling a link in the

that the nodal attributes are independently drawn from an arbitrary
distribution $\rho(h)$ and that the sampling probability $r(h_i , h_j)$ for a

exact analytic expressions of the sampled network for such network
characteristics as the degree distribution, degree correlation, and clustering
spectrum. The properties of the sampled network turn out to be sums of
quantities for the original network topology weighted by the factors stemming
from the sampling. Based on our analysis, we find that the sampled network may
have sampling-induced network properties that are absent in the original
network, which implies the potential risk of a naive generalization of the

quantum annealer via experiments and numerical simulations. Our investigation
adopts a recently proposed technique that interpolates between pure quantum
dynamics and pure thermodynamics. Experiments were conducted on a quantum
annealer with an anneal pause function, which inserts a thermal relaxation
period into the annealing schedule by pausing the transverse field, which is a
source of quantum fluctuation. After investigating the special Hamiltonian that
characterizes the quantum thermodynamics of the system, we then observed
enhancement of thermodynamic signature depending on the anneal pause parameter.
The time development of the state vector, observed in the open quantum
simulation, provides rich information for investigating phenomena beyond
energy-gap analysis. We identified a special eigenstate bridges ground states
far-separated in Hilbert space and the transfer probabilities from one ground
state to another. This finding can improve the sampling uniformity by reducing
the sampling bias in finding the classical ground states in the quantum
annealer. Our study does not only characterize the open quantum phenomenon of
the specific Hamiltonian but also demonstrates the usefulness of the method in
investigating noisy quantum devices.

functions, which explain existing HERMES $b_1$ data, at $Q^2=2.5$ GeV$^2$ to
the $Q^2$ range of the Fermilab Drell-Yan measurements. Then, we predicted that
the asymmetry is of the order of a few percent. The Drell-Yan experiment has an

fundamental for the automated detection / analysis of glaucoma. Traditional
segmentation approaches depend heavily upon hand-crafted features and a priori

clinical environment. Recently, deep learning methods based on fully
convolutional networks (FCNs) have been successful in resolving segmentation
problems. However, the reliance on large annotated training data is problematic
when dealing with medical images. If a sufficient amount of annotated training
data to cover all possible variations is not available, FCNs do not provide
accurate segmentation. In addition, FCNs have a large receptive field in the
convolutional layers, and hence produce coarse outputs of boundaries. Hence, we
propose a new fully automated method that we refer to as a dual-stage fully
convolutional networks (DSFCN). Our approach leverages deep residual
architectures and FCNs and learns and infers the location of the optic cup and
disk in a step-wise manner with fine-grained details. During training, our
approach learns from the training data and the estimated results derived from
the previous iteration. The ability to learn from the previous iteration
optimizes the learning of the optic cup and the disk boundaries. During testing
(prediction), DSFCN uses test (input) images and the estimated probability map
derived from previous iterations to gradually improve the segmentation
accuracy. Our method achieved an average Dice co-efficient of 0.8488 and 0.9441

angular and spectral profiles are identified. Several saturation effects due to
the beam energy, size and foil density are found for the CTR energy, and the
dependences vary for different spectral components such as in the Terahertz
(THz) and optical range. The detailed substructure of the beam also affects
greatly the radiation generation, leading to distinctive high harmonic
components. Electrons with kinetic energy from sub MeV to tens of GeV are
explored. For few MeV electron beams, the effects of the foil plasma on the
beam dynamics and associated CTR generation, resembles closely the CTR from hot
electrons produced in intense laser-plasma interactions. These results may find
important applications in beam diagnostics either in laser-plasma based

fluctuations with respect to the direction of the magnetic field $B$ in
Ni-doped CeCoIn$_5$ by measuring the magnetization $M$ and specific heat $C$.
The results show that $M/B$ at $B=0.1\ {\rm T}$ for both the tetragonal $c$ and
$a$ directions exhibits $T^{-\eta}$ dependencies, and that $C/T$ at $B=0$
follows a $-\ln T$ function, which are the characteristics of non-Fermi-liquid
(NFL) behaviors. For $B\,||\,c$, both the $M/B\propto T^{-\eta}$ and $C/T
\propto -\ln T$ dependencies change into nearly temperature-constant behaviors
by increasing $B$, indicating a crossover from the NFL state to the
Fermi-liquid state. For $B\,||\,a$, however, the NFL behavior in $C/T$ persists
up to $B=7\ {\rm T}$, whereas $M/B$ exhibits temperature-independent behavior
for $B\ge 1\ {\rm T}$. These contrasting characteristics in $M/B$ and $C/T$
reflect the anisotropic nature of quantum critical fluctuations; the $c$-axis
spin component significantly contributes to the quantum critical fluctuations.
We compare this anisotropic behavior of the spin fluctuations to
superconducting properties in pure CeCoIn$_5$, especially to the anisotropy in
the upper critical field and the Ising-like characteristics in the spin
resonance excitation, and suggest a close relationship between them.

acceleration. However, the details of the cosmic-ray acceleration are still not
well understood. Gamma ray observation is a promising method to study
cosmic-ray acceleration in the SNRs, because a hadronic gamma ray can trace
high energy cosmic-rays above ~GeV energy. Conventional theory predicts that
the hadronic gamma ray shows a flat vFv spectrum from the pion-creation
threshold energy to the maximum energy of diffusive shock acceleration. In this
paper, by employing numerical simulations that solve a hybrid system of the
magnetohydrodynamics of a molecular cloud and diffusive propagation of
cosmic-rays, we demonstrate that the hadronic gamma ray spectrum can be harder
than the conventional one and that the modulated spectrum becomes consistent
with observations. The modification mechanism is explained as follows: The
cosmic-rays accelerated at the supernova blast wave shock propagate into a
clump of a molecular cloud. The cosmic-ray streaming in the cloud induces the
so-called Bell instability that induces Alfven waves in the cloud. The induced
magnetic field fluctuations prevent further cosmic-ray incursion by diminishing
the diffusion coefficient for the cosmic-rays below ~1 TeV energy. This
mechanism reinforces recent claims of a similar spectral modification by
magnetic field amplification around a molecular cloud by Inoue et al.(2012) and
Celli et al.(2018).

atmosphere is required to maintain clement temperatures for most of the HZ,
with several bars required at the outer edge. However, most complex aerobic
life on Earth is limited by CO2 concentrations of just fractions of a bar. At
the same time, most exoplanets in the traditional HZ reside in proximity to M

promote greater abundances of gases that can be toxic in the atmospheres of
orbiting planets, such as carbon monoxide (CO). Here we show that the HZ for
complex aerobic life is likely limited relative to that for microbial life. We
use a 1D radiative-convective climate and photochemical models to circumscribe
a Habitable Zone for Complex Life (HZCL) based on known toxicity limits for a

Such a definition fails to incorporate information of the actual path the

which we term the winding distance, we demonstrate that for Brownian particles,
confinement to a network can induce a transition in the mean squared
displacement from diffusive to ballistic behaviour, $\langle x^2(t) \rangle
\propto t^2$ for long times. A multiple scales approach is used to derive a
macroscopic evolution equation for the displacement of a particle and uncover a
topological condition for whether this transition in the mean squared
displacement will occur. Furthermore, for networks satisfying this topological
condition, we identify a prediction of the timescale upon which the
displacement transitions to long-time behaviour. Finally, we extend the
investigation of displacement on networks to a class of anomalously diffusive
transport processes, where we find that the mean squared displacement at long

process.

Prediction in projection2 discusses how much smaller embeddings can provide
useful prediction even though they may not be able to resolve the dynamics of

when the assignment must have Hamming weight in some congruence class modulo M,
for various choices of the modulus M. Due to the known classification of
tractable Boolean CSPs, this mainly reduces to the study of three cases: 2-SAT,
HORN-SAT, and LIN-2 (linear equations mod 2). We classify the moduli M for
which these respective problems are polynomial time solvable, and when they are
not (assuming the ETH). Our study reveals that this modular constraint lends a
surprising richness to these classic, well-studied problems, with interesting
broader connections to complexity theory and coding theory. The HORN-SAT case
is connected to the covering complexity of polynomials representing the NAND
function mod M. The LIN-2 case is tied to the sparsity of polynomials
representing the OR function mod M, which in turn has connections to modular
weight distribution properties of linear codes and locally decodable codes. In
both cases, the analysis of our algorithm as well as the hardness reduction
rely on these polynomial representations, highlighting an interesting algebraic
common ground between hard cases for our algorithms and the gadgets which show
hardness. These new complexity measures of polynomial representations merit
further study.
  The inspiration for our study comes from a recent work by N\""agele, Sudakov,
and Zenklusen on submodular minimization with a global congruence constraint.
Our algorithm for HORN-SAT has strong similarities to their algorithm, and in
particular identical kind of set systems arise in both cases. Our connection to
polynomial representations leads to a simpler analysis of such set systems, and
also sheds light on (but does not resolve) the complexity of submodular
minimization with a congruency requirement modulo a composite M.

Guided by our observations, we then present examples of overparameterized

uniform convergence provably cannot ""explain generalization"" -- even if we take
into account the implicit bias of GD {\em to the fullest extent possible}. More
precisely, even if we consider only the set of classifiers output by GD, which
have test errors less than some small $\epsilon$ in our settings, we show that
applying (two-sided) uniform convergence on this set of classifiers will yield
only a vacuous generalization guarantee larger than $1-\epsilon$. Through these
findings, we cast doubt on the power of uniform convergence-based
generalization bounds to provide a complete picture of why overparameterized

could be observed in both density fluctuation and radial electric field
fluctuation, and the bicoherence analyses showed significant couplings between

Unlike existing switch-based interfaces that can only un-intuitively generate

foot movements with dynamic force & position feedbacks. An experiment with ten
naive subjects was conducted to test the system. In view of the significant

opportunity to control the common but much desired property of thermal
expansion, which is valuable not only in scientific interests but also in
practical applications. However, most of the available NTE materials are
limited to a narrow temperature range, and the NTE effect is generally weakened
by means of various modifications. Here, we report an enhanced NTE effect that
occurs over a wide temperature range (\alpha V = -5.24 * 10-5 {\deg}C^-1,
25-575 {\deg} C), and this NTE effect is accompanied by an abnormal enhanced
tetragonality, a large spontaneous polarization, and a G-type antiferromagnetic
ordering in the present perovskite-type ferroelectric of (1-x)PbTiO3-xBiCoO3.
Specifically, for the composition of 0.5PbTiO3-0.5BiCoO3, an extensive
volumetric contraction of ~4.8 % has been observed near the Curie temperature
of 700 {\deg}C, which represents the highest level in PbTiO3-based
ferroelectrics. According to our experimental and theoretical results, the
giant NTE originates from a synergistic effect of the ferroelectrostriction and
spin-crossover of cobalt on the crystal lattice. The actual NTE mechanism is
contrasted with previous functional NTE materials, in which the NTE is simply
coupled with one ordering such as electronic, magnetic, or ferroelectric
ordering. The present study sheds light on the understanding of NTE mechanisms

fruitful to study wide random neural networks. Central to these approaches are
certain scaling limits of such networks. We unify these results by introducing
a notion of a straightline \emph{tensor program} that can express most neural
network computations, and we characterize its scaling limit when its tensors
are large and randomized. From our framework follows (1) the convergence of
random neural networks to Gaussian processes for architectures such as
recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, residual networks,
attention, and any combination thereof, with or without batch normalization;
(2) conditions under which the \emph{gradient independence assumption} -- that
weights in backpropagation can be assumed to be independent from weights in the
forward pass -- leads to correct computation of gradient dynamics, and
corrections when it does not; (3) the convergence of the Neural Tangent Kernel,
a recently proposed kernel used to predict training dynamics of neural networks
under gradient descent, at initialization for all architectures in (1) without
batch normalization. Mathematically, our framework is general enough to
rederive classical random matrix results such as the semicircle and the
Marchenko-Pastur laws, as well as recent results in neural network Jacobian
singular values. We hope our work opens a way toward design of even stronger
Gaussian Processes, initialization schemes to avoid gradient
explosion/vanishing, and deeper understanding of SGD dynamics in modern

their locations are considered in two different manners. In case one, force is
applied to all beads of the filament, which is termed as homogeneous
self-propulsion. Here, we obtain a monotonic decrease in the flexibility of the
filament with P\'eclet number. Hence, radius of gyration also displays the same
trend. Moreover, the radius of gyration of the filament shows universal
dependence for various bending rigidities with flexure number. The effective
diffusivity of the filament shows enhancement with the active force and it
increases linearly with force and bending rigidity. In case two,
self-propulsion force is applied only to few bond vectors. The location of
active forces is chosen in a periodic manner starting from the tail of the
filament and leaving the front end without force. In this case, filament
acquires various structures such as rod-like, helical, circular, and folded

a promising solution to achieve large-scale wireless traffic prediction in a
cost-efficient manner. Our contribution is three-fold. First, to the best of
our knowledge, this paper is the first to empower GP regression with the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for parallel hyper-parameter
optimization in the training phase, where such a scalable training framework
well balances the local estimation in baseband units (BBUs) and information
consensus among BBUs in a principled way for large-scale executions. Second, in
the prediction phase, we fuse local predictions obtained from the BBUs via a
cross-validation based optimal strategy, which demonstrates itself to be
reliable and robust for general regression tasks. Moreover, such a
cross-validation based optimal fusion strategy is built upon a well
acknowledged probabilistic model to retain the valuable closed-form GP
inference properties. Third, we propose a C-RAN based scalable wireless
prediction architecture, where the prediction accuracy and the time consumption
can be balanced by tuning the number of the BBUs according to the real-time
system demands. Experimental results show that our proposed scalable GP model
can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches considerably, in terms of

observations of 3C 320 FR II radio galaxy, located at the centre of a cluster
of galaxies at a redshift $z=0.342$. A pair of X-ray cavities have been
detected at an average distance of $\sim$38 kpc along the East and West
directions with the cavity energy, age and total power equal to
$\sim$7.7$\times$10$^{59}$ erg, $\sim$7$\times$10$^7$ yr and
$\sim$3.5$\times$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. The cooling luminosity
within the cooling radius of $\sim$100 kpc was found to be $L_{cool}
\sim8.5\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Comparison of these two estimates implies
that the cavity power is sufficiently high to balance the radiative loss. A
pair of weak shocks have also been evidenced at distances of $\sim$47 kpc and
$\sim$76 kpc surrounding the radio bubbles. Using the observed density jumps of
$\sim$1.8 and $\sim$2.1 at shock locations along the East and West directions,
we estimate the Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$) to be $\sim$1.6 and $\sim$1.8,
respectively. A sharp surface brightness edge was also detected at relatively
larger radius ($\sim$80 kpc) along the South direction. Density jump at this
surface brightness edge was estimated to be $\sim$1.6 and is probably due to
the presence of a cold front in this cluster. The far-infrared luminosity
yielded the star formation rate of 51 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and is 1/4$^{th}$
of the cooling rate ($\dot{M}$ $\sim$ 192 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$).

$\widetilde{O}(K/\epsilon^2(1-\gamma)^3)$ sample transitions for arbitrarily

  Approach to Fairness for Machine Learning",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fairness for Machine Learning has received considerable attention, recently.
Various mathematical formulations of fairness have been proposed, and it has
been shown that it is impossible to satisfy all of them simultaneously. The
literature so far has dealt with these impossibility results by quantifying the
tradeoffs between different formulations of fairness. Our work takes a
different perspective on this issue. Rather than requiring all notions of
fairness to (partially) hold at the same time, we ask which one of them is the
most appropriate given the societal domain in which the decision-making model
is to be deployed. We take a descriptive approach and set out to identify the
notion of fairness that best captures \emph{lay people's perception of
fairness}. We run adaptive experiments designed to pinpoint the most compatible
notion of fairness with each participant's choices through a small number of
tests. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the most simplistic mathematical
definition of fairness---namely, demographic parity---most closely matches
people's idea of fairness in two distinct application scenarios. This
conclusion remains intact even when we explicitly tell the participants about
the alternative, more complicated definitions of fairness, and we reduce the
cognitive burden of evaluating those notions for them. Our findings have
important implications for the Fair ML literature and the discourse on
formalizing algorithmic fairness.

In bioinformatics, it corresponds to computing words that are absent from a

sensitivity on the time derivative of GW amplitude was estimated to be
$10^{-19}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ independent of the direction, polarization and

a model of 3-dimensional pulsar distribution in our Galaxy and take the pulsar

that a low amount of iron content has a similar effect as of applying
compressive strain. Due to high oxidation state of Fe4+ at the active site, the
Fe-O bond is shorter than in pure FeOOH, which is beneficial for extracting
electrons from states delocalized on Fe and Ni atoms. At 33% of Fe content the
efficiency is even better since Fe3+ is at the active site and can easily
change oxidation state during the reaction. However, the efficiency drops at
higher iron percentages since the surface is unstable and may form FeOOH
aggregates. We find that the best performance is obtained at 33% iron content
and 5% expansion. Therefore, in addition to changing iron content, strain can
also be used as a control handle for improving water splitting catalysis.

wave propagation models in the medium, such as the variable coefficient
Helmholtz equation, include a faraway decay radiation condition (RC). It is
desirable to develop algorithms that incorporate the full physics of the
heterogeneous and unbounded medium wave propagation model, and avoid an
approximation of the RC. In this work we first present and analyze an
overlapping decomposition framework that is equivalent to the full-space
heterogeneous-homogenous continuous model, governed by the Helmholtz equation
with a spatially dependent refractive index and the RC. Our novel overlapping
framework allows the user to choose two free boundaries, and gain the advantage
of applying established high-order finite and boundary element methods (FEM and
BEM) to simulate an equivalent coupled model.
  The coupled model comprises auxiliary interior bounded heterogeneous and
exterior unbounded homogeneous Helmholtz problems. A smooth boundary can be
chosen for simulating the exterior problem using a spectrally accurate BEM, and
a simple boundary can be used to setup a high-order FEM for the interior
problem. Thanks to the spectral accuracy of the exterior computational model,
the resulting coupled system in the overlapping region is relatively very
small. Using the decomposed equivalent framework, we develop a novel
overlapping FEM-BEM algorithm for simulating the acoustic or electromagnetic
wave propagation in two dimensions. Our FEM-BEM algorithm for the full-space
model incorporates the RC exactly. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
efficiency of the FEM-BEM approach for simulating smooth and non-smooth wave
fields, with the latter induced by a complex heterogeneous medium and a

for field in the $a$-$b$ plane, and evidence for the SDW disappears as the
applied field is rotated toward the tetragonal $c$ axis. It is important to
understand the interplay between the SDW and a possible FFLO state in
$\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$, as the mere existence of an SDW does not necessary exclude
an FFLO state. Here, based on a model constructed on the basis of available
experiments, we show that an FFLO state competes with an SDW phase. The SDW
state in $\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$ is stabilized when the field is directed close to
the $a$-$b$ plane. When the field is rotated toward the $c$ axis, the FFLO
state emerges, and the SDW phase disappears. In the FFLO state, the nodal
planes with extra quasiparticles (where the superconducting order parameter is
zero) are perpendicular to the field, and in the SDW phase, the quasiparticle
density of states is reduced. We test this model prediction by measuring heat
transported by normal quasiparticles in the superconducting state. As a
function of field, we observe a reduction of thermal conductivity for field
close to the $a$-$b$ plane and an enhancement of thermal conductivity when
field is close to the $c$ axis, consistent with theoretical expectations. Our
modeling and experiments, therefore, indicate the existence of the FFLO state
when field is parallel to the $c$ axis.

networks, the main bottleneck lies in the acquisition of a large number of
manually-annotated images for efficient learning. This is especially true in
surgical context, where patient-to-patient differences impede the overall
generalizability. In order to cope with this lack of annotated data, we propose
a self-supervised approach in a robot-assisted context. To our knowledge, the
proposed approach is the first to make use of the kinematic model of the robot
in order to generate training labels. The core contribution of the paper is to
propose an optimization method to obtain good labels for training despite an
unknown hand-eye calibration and an imprecise kinematic model. The labels can
subsequently be used for fine-tuning a fully-convolutional neural network for
pixel-wise classification. As a result, the tool can be segmented in the

analyses is polynomial. For modern machine learning, where the dimension can be
in the millions, such dependence would be catastrophic. We analyze perturbed

non-invasive modalities that measure the weak electromagnetic fields generated
by neural activity. Inferring the location of the current sources that
generated these magnetic fields is an ill-posed inverse problem known as source
imaging. When considering a group study, a baseline approach consists in
carrying out the estimation of these sources independently for each subject.
The ill-posedness of each problem is typically addressed using sparsity
promoting regularizations. A straightforward way to define a common pattern for
these sources is then to average them. A more advanced alternative relies on a
joint localization of sources for all subjects taken together, by enforcing
some similarity across all estimated sources. An important advantage of this
approach is that it consists in a single estimation in which all measurements
are pooled together, making the inverse problem better posed. Such a joint
estimation poses however a few challenges, notably the selection of a valid
regularizer that can quantify such spatial similarities. We propose in this
work a new procedure that can do so while taking into account the geometrical
structure of the cortex. We call this procedure Minimum Wasserstein Estimates
(MWE). The benefits of this model are twofold. First, joint inference allows to
pool together the data of different brain geometries, accumulating more spatial
information. Second, MWE are defined through Optimal Transport (OT) metrics
which provide a tool to model spatial proximity between cortical sources of
different subjects, hence not enforcing identical source location in the group.
These benefits allow MWE to be more accurate than standard MEG source
localization techniques. To support these claims, we perform source
localization on realistic MEG simulations based on forward operators derived
from MRI scans. On a visual task dataset, we demonstrate how MWE infer neural
patterns similar to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) maps.

constrained problems), one looks for solution that have few nonzero components.
In this paper, we consider problems where sparsity is exactly measured either
by the nonconvex l0 pseudonorm (and not by substitute penalty terms) or by the
belonging of the solution to a finite union of subsets. Due to the
combinatorial nature of the sparsity constraint, such problems do not generally
display convexity properties, even if the criterion to minimize is convex. In
the most common approach to tackle them, one replaces the sparsity constraint
by a convex penalty term, supposed to induce sparsity. Thus doing, one loses
the original exact sparse optimization problem, but gains convexity. However,
by doing so, it is not clear that one obtains a lower bound of the original
exact sparse optimization problem. In this paper, we propose another approach,
where we lose convexity but where we gain at keeping the original exact sparse
optimization formulation, by displaying lower bound convex minimization
programs. For this purpose , we introduce suitable conjugacies, induced by a
novel class of one-sided linear couplings. Thus equipped, we present a

inexact, the obtained solution is not AC-feasible. The quality of the obtained
solution is essential for several practical applications of AC-OPF, but
detailed analyses are lacking in existing literature. This paper aims to cover
this gap. We provide an in-depth investigation of the solution characteristics

metrics that lead to a better understanding of the quality of the identified

optimality gap of less than 1%, several test cases still exhibit substantial
distances to both AC feasibility and local optimality and the newly proposed

recover an AC-feasible solution in 15 out of 45 cases, and using the proposed
metrics, we show that most failed test instances exhibit substantial distances

intensive and to date there have been no such visualizations of urban digital

supercomputer software architecture for visualization; a photo-realistic
terapixel 3D visualization of urban IoT data supporting daily updates; a
rigorous evaluation of cloud supercomputing for our application. Method: we
migrated the Blender Cycles path tracer to the public cloud within a new
software framework designed to scale to petaFLOP performance. Results: we
demonstrate we can compute a terapixel visualization in under one hour, the
system scaling at 98% efficiency to use 1024 public cloud GPU nodes delivering
14 petaFLOPS. The resulting terapixel image supports interactive browsing of
the city and its data at a wide range of sensing scales. Conclusion: The GPU
compute resource available in the cloud is greater than anything available on
our national supercomputers providing access to globally competitive resources.
The direct financial cost of access, compared to procuring and running these
systems, was low. The indirect cost, in overcoming teething issues with cloud
software development, should reduce significantly over time.

deals with a rigorous mathematical proof of convergence between solutions of
two problems : we start from a microscopic description of adhesions using a
delayed and constrained vector valued equation with spacial diffusion and show
the convergence towards the corresponding friction limit. The convergence is
performed with respect to the bond characteristic lifetime $\varepsilon$ whose
inverse is also proportional to the stifness of the bonds. The originality of
this work is the extension of gradient flow techniques to our setting. Namely,
the discrete finite difference term in the gradient flow energy is here
replaced by a delay term which complicates greatly the mathematical analysis.
Contrarily to the standard approach [Oelz SeMa 2011], compactness in time is
not provided by the energy minimization process~: a series of past times are
taken into account in our discrete energy. A supplementary equation on the time
derivative is obtained requiring uniform estimate with respect to $\varepsilon$
of the Lagrange multiplier and provides compactness. Due to the non-linearity
induced by the constraint, a specific stability estimate useful in our previous
works, is not at hand here. Numerical simulations even showed that this
estimate does not hold. Nevertheless, transposing our delay operator, we
succeed in proving convergence under slightly weaker hypotheses. The result
relies on a careful initial layer analysis, extending [Milisic Esaim Proc 2018]
to the space dependent setting.

infrared excess, emission-line spectra, and flare activity. Our photometric
monitoring (2008--2018) detects (1)~an $\sim$3.43~day period, likely arising
from rotational modulation by surface starspots, (2)~sporadic brightening on
time scales of days due to accretion, (3)~irregular minor flux drops due to
circumstellar dust extinction, and (4)~major flux drops, each lasting for a
couple of months with a recurrence time, though not exactly periodic, of about
two years. The star experiences normal reddening by large grains, i.e., redder
when dimmer, but exhibits an unusual ""blueing"" phenomenon in that the star
turns blue near brightness minima. The maximum extinction during relatively
short (lasting $\leq 50$~days) events, is proportional to the duration, a
consequence of varying clump sizes. For longer events, the extinction is
independent of duration, suggestive of a transverse string distribution of
clumps. Polarization monitoring indicates an optical polarization varying
$\sim3\%$--8$\%$, with the level anticorrelated with the slow brightness
change. Temporal variation of the unpolarized and polarized light sets
constraints on the size and orbital distance of the circumstellar clumps in the
interplay with the young star and scattering envelope. These transiting clumps
are edge-on manifestations of the ring- or spiral-like structures found
recently in young stars with imaging in infrared of scattered light, or in

poorly understood. The relationship between sizes at division and birth in
single cells is used as a metric to categorize the basis of size homeostasis
[1-3]. Cells dividing at a fixed size regardless of birth size (sizer) are
expected to show a division-birth slope of 0, whereas cells dividing after
growing for a fixed size increment (adder) have an expected slope of +1 [4].
These two theoretical values are, however, rarely experimentally observed. For
example, rod-shaped fission yeast $\it{Schizosaccharomyces}$ $\it{pombe}$
cells, which divide at a fixed surface area [5, 6], exhibit a division-birth
slope for cell lengths of 0.25$\pm$0.02, significantly different from the
expected sizer value of zero. Here we investigate possible reasons for this
discrepancy by developing a mathematical model of sizer control including the
relevant sources of variation. Our results support $\it{pure}$ sizer control
and show that deviation from zero slope is exaggerated by measurement of an
inappropriate geometrical quantity (e.g., length instead of area), combined
with cell-to-cell radius variability. The model predicts that mutants with
greater errors in size sensing or septum positioning paradoxically appear to
behave as better sizers. Furthermore, accounting for cell width variability, we
show that pure sizer control can in some circumstances reproduce the apparent
adder behaviour observed in $\it{E. coli}$. These findings demonstrate that
analysis of geometric variation can lead to new insights into cell size
control.

applications involving complex models, and sometimes calculating the likelihood
itself is difficult. Synthetic likelihood is one approach for carrying out
inference when the likelihood is intractable, but it is straightforward to
simulate from the model. The method constructs an approximate likelihood by
taking a vector summary statistic as being multivariate normal, with the
unknown mean and covariance matrix estimated by simulation for any given
parameter value. Our article makes three contributions. The first shows that if
the summary statistic satisfies a central limit theorem, then the synthetic
likelihood posterior is asymptotically normal and yields credible sets with the
correct level of frequentist coverage. This result is similar to that obtained
by approximate Bayesian computation. The second contribution compares the
computational efficiency of Bayesian synthetic likelihood and approximate
Bayesian computation using the acceptance probability for rejection and
importance sampling algorithms with a ""good"" proposal distribution. We show
that Bayesian synthetic likelihood is computationally more efficient than
approximate Bayesian computation, and behaves similarly to regression-adjusted
approximate Bayesian computation. Based on the asymptotic results, the third
contribution proposes using adjusted inference methods when a possibly
misspecified form is assumed for the covariance matrix of the synthetic
likelihood, such as diagonal or a factor model, to speed up the computation.
The methodology is illustrated with some simulated and real examples.

duration outburst in 2003 after more than two and a half decades of inactivity.
The 2003 event was extensively studied in multi-wavelength bands by many
groups. The striking feature is that the total energy released is extremely
high as compared to that in tens of outbursts which followed. In this paper, we
look at this event and study both the spectral and temporal properties of the
source using two component advective flow (TCAF) paradigm. We extract accretion
flow parameters for each observation from spectral properties of the decay
phase and determine the mass of the black hole. We computed the energy released
during all the known outbursts since 2003 and showed that on an average, the
energy release in an outburst is proportional to the duration of the quiescent
state just prior to it, with the exception of the 2004 outburst. A constant
rate of supply of matter from the companion cannot explain the energy release
in 2004 outburst. However, if the energy release of 2003 is incomplete and the
leftover is released in 2004, then the companion's rate of matter supply can be
constant since 1977 till date. We believe that erratic behaviour of viscosity
at the accumulation radius $X_p$ of matter as well as location the $X_p$
itself, rather than the random variation of mass transfer rate from the
companion, could be responsible for non-uniformity in outburst pattern. We
discuss several factors on which the waiting time and duration of the next

point methods. The non-diagonal aspect of this regularization is implicit,
since all the off-diagonal elements of the regularization matrices are
cancelled out by those elements present in the Newton system, which do not
contribute important information in the computation of the Newton direction.
Such a regularization has multiple goals. The obvious one is to improve the
spectral properties of the Newton system solved at each iteration of the
interior point method. On the other hand, the regularization matrices introduce
sparsity to the aforementioned linear system, allowing for more efficient
factorizations. We also propose a rule for tuning the regularization
dynamically based on the properties of the problem, such that sufficiently
large eigenvalues of the non-regularized system are perturbed insignificantly.
This alleviates the need of finding specific regularization values through
experimentation, which is the most common approach in literature. We provide
perturbation bounds for the eigenvalues of the non-regularized system matrix
and then discuss the spectral properties of the regularized matrix. Finally, we
demonstrate the efficiency of the method applied to solve standard small and

patterns in the Stern layer can be considered as a general feature of ionic
liquids at electrochemical interfaces, the transition between patterns being
controlled by the net balance of charge in the innermost layer of adsorbed
molecules. This explains previously reported experimental and computational
results and, for the first time, why these pattern changes are triggered by any
perturbation of the charge density at the innermost layer of the electric
double layer (voltage and composition changes, and vacancies at the electrode

a simple two-dimensional lattice model with only nearest-neighbour
interactions, governed by highly screened ionic interactions and short-range
and excluded volume interactions. We also show that the results of our

wave-structure interaction problem which can be reduced to a transmission
problem for a Boussinesq system. Initial boundary value problems and
transmission problems in dimension d= 1 for $2\times2$ hyperbolic systems are
well understood. However, for many applications, and especially for the
description of surface water waves, dispersive perturbations of hyperbolic
systems must be considered. We consider here a configuration where the motion
of the waves is governed by a Boussinesq system (a dispersive perturbation of
the hyperbolic nonlinear shallow water equations), and in the presence of a
fixed partially immersed obstacle. We shall insist on the differences and
similarities with respect to the standard hyperbolic case, and focus our
attention on a new phenomenon, namely, the apparition of a dispersive boundary
layer. In order to obtain existence and uniform bounds on the solutions over
the relevant time scale, a control of this dispersive boundary layer and of the
oscillations in time it generates is necessary. This analysis leads to a new
notion of compatibility condition that is shown to coincide with the standard
hyperbolic compatibility conditions when the dispersive parameter is set to
zero. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that these phenomena
(likely to play a central role in the analysis of initial boundary value
problems for dispersive perturbations of hyperbolic systems) are exhibited.

to describe analytically and computationally the dynamics of microscopic
particles driven by the motion of surface-attached bacteria undergoing
run-and-tumble motion. We compute analytical expressions for the rotational
diffusion coefficient, the swimming speed and the effective diffusion
coefficient. At short times, the mean squared displacement (MSD) is
proportional to the square of the swimming speed, which is independent of the
particle size (for fixed density of attached bacteria) and scales linearly with
the number of attached bacteria; in contrast, at long times the MSD scales
quadratically with the size of the swimmer and is independent of the number of
bacteria. We then extend our result to the situation where the surface-attached
bacteria undergo chemotaxis within the linear response regime. We demonstrate
that bacteria-driven particles are capable of performing artificial chemotaxis,
with a chemotactic drift velocity linear in the chemical concentration gradient
and independent of the size of the particle. Our results are validated against
numerical simulations in the Brownian dynamics limit and will be relevant to
the optimal design of micro-swimmers for biomedical applications.

atmosphere into multiple fluids. For example, the atmosphere could be divided
into buoyant updrafts and stable regions. The fluids interact through a common
pressure, drag and mass transfers (entrainment and detrainment). Little is
known about the numerical properties of mass transfer terms between the fluids.
We derive mass transfer terms which relabel the fluids and derive numerical

different time instants induced by a single acoustic radiation force (ARF) with
100% or 50% of the energy in conventional use. The SHEAR-net consists of a
localizer called the S-net to first localize the lesion location and then uses
recurrent layers to extract temporal correlations from wave patterns using
different time frames, and finally, with an estimator, it reconstructs the
shear modulus image from the concatenated outputs of S-net and recurrent
layers. The network is trained with 800 simulation and a limited number of CIRS
tissue mimicking phantom data and is optimized using a multi-task learning loss
function where the tasks are: inclusion localization and modulus estimation.
The efficacy of the proposed SHEAR-net is extensively evaluated both
qualitatively and quantitatively on 125 test set of motion data obtained from
simulation and CIRS phantoms. We show that the proposed approach consistently
outperforms the current state-of-the-art method and achieves overall 4-5 dB
improvement in PSNR and SNR. In addition, an average gain of 0.15 in DSC and
SSIM values indicate that the SHEAR-net has a better inclusion coverage area

learning based technique can accurately estimate shear modulus for a minimum
tissue displacement of 0.5$\mu$m and image multiple inclusions with a single

could be diluted throughout a large fraction of its gaseous envelope, providing
a stabilising compositional gradient over an extended region of the planet.
This could trigger layered semi-convection, which, in the context of giant
planets more generally, may explain Saturn's luminosity excess and play a role
in causing the abnormally large radii of some hot Jupiters. In giant planet
interiors, it could take the form of density staircases, which are convective
layers separated by thin stably stratified interfaces. In addition, the
efficiency of tidal dissipation is known to depend strongly on the planetary
internal structure. We aim to study the resulting tidal dissipation when
internal waves are excited in a region of layered semi-convection by tidal
gravitational forcing due to other bodies (such as moons in giant planet
systems, or stars in hot Jupiter systems). We adopt a local Cartesian model
with a background layered density profile subjected to an imposed tidal
forcing, and we compute the viscous and thermal dissipation rates numerically.
We find that the rates of tidal dissipation can be enhanced in a region of
layered semi-convection compared to a uniformly convective medium, where the
latter corresponds with the usual assumption adopted in giant planet interior
models. In particular, a region of layered semi-convection possesses a richer
set of resonances, allowing enhanced dissipation for a wider range of tidal
frequencies. The details of these results significantly depend on the
structural properties of the layered semi-convective regions. Layered
semi-convection could contribute towards explaining the high tidal dissipation
rates observed in Jupiter and Saturn, which have not yet been fully explained
by theory. Further work is required to explore the efficiency of this mechanism
in global models.

and hypertrophic signalling in ventricular cardiomyocytes. L-type Ca2+ channels
trigger release of Ca2+ from ryanodine receptors (RyRs) for cellular
contraction, while signalling downstream of Gq coupled receptors stimulates
Ca2+ release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), engaging
hypertrophic signalling pathways. Modulation of the amplitude, duration, and
duty cycle of the cytosolic Ca2+ contraction signal, and spatial localisation,
have all been proposed to encode this hypertrophic signal. Given current
knowledge of IP3Rs, we develop a model describing the effect of functional
interaction (cross-talk) between RyR and IP3R channels on the Ca2+ transient,
and examine the sensitivity of the Ca2+ transient shape to properties of IP3R
activation. A key result of our study is that IP3R activation increases Ca2+
transient duration for a broad range of IP3R properties, but the effect of IP3R
activation on Ca2+ transient amplitude is dependent on IP3 concentration.
Furthermore we demonstrate that IP3-mediated Ca2+ release in the cytosol
increases the duty cycle of the Ca2+ transient, the fraction of the cycle for
which [Ca2+] is elevated, across a broad range of parameter values and IP3
concentrations. When coupled to a model of downstream transcription factor
(NFAT) activation, we demonstrate that there is a high correspondence between
the Ca transient duty cycle and the proportion of activated NFAT in the
nucleus. These findings suggest increased cytosolic Ca2+ duty cycle as a
plausible mechanism for IP3-dependent hypertrophic signalling via
Ca2+-sensitive transcription factors such as NFAT in ventricular
cardiomyocytes.

functional theory calculations are performed to complement the reference data
on the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio at small but finite

energy deviates remarkably from the simple quadratic dependence already at
elongations of several percent. Nevertheless, LCBOP provides the results
consistent with the reference data and thus realistically describes in-plane
deformations of graphene. Reasonable agreement is also observed for the

(referred to as tubes) of moving persons and apply a multi-stage processing to
match a given query tube with a gallery of stored tubes recorded through other
cameras. Initially, we apply a binary classifier to remove noisy images from
the input query tube. In the next step, we use a key-pose detection-based query
minimization. This reduces the length of the query tube by removing redundant
frames. Finally, a 3-stage hierarchical re-identification framework is used to
rank the output tubes as per the matching scores. Experiments with publicly
available video re-identification datasets reveal that our framework is better
than state-of-the-art methods. It ranks the tubes with an increased CMC
accuracy of 6-8% across multiple datasets. Also, our method significantly
reduces the number of false positives. A new video re-identification dataset,
named Tube-based Reidentification Video Dataset (TRiViD), has been prepared
with an aim to help the re-identification research community

prerogatives, such as language processing, have witnessed remarkable
improvements in state of the art models. One advantage of this technological
boost is to facilitate comparison between different neural networks and human
performance, in order to deepen our understanding of human cognition. Here, we
investigate which neural network architecture (feed-forward vs. recurrent)
matches human behavior in artificial grammar learning, a crucial aspect of
language acquisition. Prior experimental studies proved that artificial
grammars can be learnt by human subjects after little exposure and often
without explicit knowledge of the underlying rules. We tested four grammars
with different complexity levels both in humans and in feedforward and
recurrent networks. Our results show that both architectures can 'learn' (via
error back-propagation) the grammars after the same number of training
sequences as humans do, but recurrent networks perform closer to humans than
feedforward ones, irrespective of the grammar complexity level. Moreover,
similar to visual processing, in which feedforward and recurrent architectures
have been related to unconscious and conscious processes, our results suggest
that explicit learning is best modeled by recurrent architectures, whereas
feedforward networks better capture the dynamics involved in implicit learning.

word, a random element sampled by the $w$-measure is given by the commutator
$\left[g,h\right]$ of two independent, Haar-random elements of $G$. Back in
1896, Frobenius showed that if $G$ is a finite group and $\psi$ an irreducible

$\frac{1}{\psi\left(e\right)}$. This is true for any compact group, and

analogous result holds with the commutator word replaced by any surface word.

induced by the materials characteristic low-temperature brittleness and high
susceptibility to oxidation. Powder metallurgy is typically the manufacturing
process of choice. Recently, Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing has proven
capable to produce fully-dense large-scale metal parts at relatively low cost,
by using high-quality wire as feedstock. In this study, this technique has been
used for the production of large-scale tungsten linear structures. The
orientation of the wire feeding has been studied and optimised to obtain
defect-free tungsten deposits. In particular, front wire feeding eliminated the
occurrence of pores and micro-cracks, when compared to side wire feeding. The
microstructure, the occurrence of defects and their relationship with the
deposition process have also been discussed. Despite the repetitive thermal
cycles and the inherent brittleness of the material, the as-deposited
structures were free from internal cracks and the layer dimensions were stable
during the entire deposition process. This enabled the production of a
relatively large-scale component, with the dimension of 210 x 75 x 12 mm. This
study has demonstrated that Wire + Arc Additive Manufacture can be used to
produce large-scale parts in unalloyed tungsten by complete fusion, presenting
a potential alternative to the powder metallurgy manufacturing route.

mass transfer through, for example, stellar wind, Roche-lobe overflow, and

K-type subgiant central star of the planetary nebula Hen 2-39 based on
high-resolution optical spectra obtained with the Ultraviolet and Visual
Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope using LTE model atmospheres.
We confirm the effective temperature of $T_\mathrm{eff} = 4350 \pm 150$ K for
the central star of the planetary nebula Hen 2-39. It has a photospheric carbon
enrichment of $[\mathrm{C/H}]= 0.36 \pm 0.08$ and a barium overabundance of

iron-group elements (calcium to iron) and establish an upper abundance limit
for technetium ($\log \epsilon_\mathrm{Tc} < 2.5$). The quality of the
available optical spectra is not sufficient to measure abundances of all
s-process elements accurately. Despite large uncertainties on the abundances as
well as on the model yields, the derived abundances are most consistent with a
progenitor mass in the range 1.75-3.00 $M_\odot$ and a metallicity of
$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]= -0.3 \pm 1.0$. This result leads to the conclusion that the
formation of such systems requires a relatively large mass transfer that is

slightly better approximation ratio can be achieved with a randomized algorithm

unsatisfactory resolutions due to various constraints such as physical,
technological and economic considerations. Super-resolution techniques can
obtain high-resolution MRI images. The traditional methods obtained the
resolution enhancement of brain MRI by interpolations, affecting the accuracy
of the following diagnose process. The requirement for brain image quality is
fast increasing. In this paper, we propose an image super-resolution (SR)
method based on overcomplete dictionaries and inherent similarity of an image
to recover the high-resolution (HR) image from a single low-resolution (LR)
image. We explore the nonlocal similarity of the image to tentatively search
for similar blocks in the whole image and present a joint reconstruction method
based on compressive sensing (CS) and similarity constraints. The sparsity and
self-similarity of the image blocks are taken as the constraints. The proposed
method is summarized in the following steps. First, a dictionary classification
method based on the measurement domain is presented. The image blocks are
classified into smooth, texture and edge parts by analyzing their features in
the measurement domain. Then, the corresponding dictionaries are trained using
the classified image blocks. Equally important, in the reconstruction part, we
use the CS reconstruction method to recover the HR brain MRI image, considering
both nonlocal similarity and the sparsity of an image as the constraints. This

propose an end-to-end neural model which employs a novel knowledge selection

appropriate selection of knowledge during the training process. Meanwhile, a
prior distribution, which is inferred from utterances only, is used to
approximate the posterior distribution so that appropriate knowledge can be
selected even without responses during the inference process. Compared with the

predicted by both a crack tip asymptotic analysis and a finite element

an outer elastic K field, an intermediate elasto-plastic field, and an inner

exhibits two interesting features, including a break around 0.9 TeV and a sharp
resonance near 1.4 TeV. In this analysis, we propose a dark matter explanation
to both exotic features seen by DAMPE. In our model, dark matter annihilates in
the galaxy via two different channels that lead to both a narrow resonance
spectrum near 1.4 TeV and electron excess events over an extended energy range
thus generating the break structure around TeV. The two annihilation channels
are mediated by two gauge bosons that interact both with dark matter and with
the standard model fermions. Dark matter annihilations through the s-channel
process mediated by the heavier boson produce monoenergetic electron-positron
pairs leading to the resonance excess. The lighter boson has a mass smaller
than the dark matter such that they can be on-shell produced in dark matter
annihilations in the galaxy; the lighter bosons in the final state subsequently
decay to generate the extended excess events due to the smeared electron energy
spectrum in this process. We further analyze constraints from various
experiments, including HESS, Fermi, AMS, and LHC, to the parameter space of the
model where both excess events can be accounted for. In order to interpret the
two new features in the DAMPE data, dark matter annihilation cross sections in
the current galaxy are typically much larger than the canonical thermal cross
section needed for the correct dark matter relic abundance. This discrepancy,
however, is remedied by the nonperturbative Sommerfeld enhancement because of
the existence of a lighter mediator in the model.

considering a co-dimension 2 pitchfork bifurcation of this system. This

at their center, as opposed to those with central high Notch levels. We show
that outside this range of parameters, in particular for low cis-coupling, a
novel kind of pattern is produced, where high Delta cells have high Notch as
well. It also suggests that the biological system is only weakly first order,
so that an additional mechanism is required to generate the observed
defect-free patterns. We construct a simple strategy for producing such

free-stream turbulence in a zero-pressure gradient, transitional boundary
layer, by means of localized sensors and actuators. A linear quadratic gaussian
regulator is considered along with a system identification technique to build
reduced-order models for control. Three actuators are developed with different
spatial supports, corresponding to a baseline shape with only vertical forcing,
and to two other shapes obtained by different optimization procedures. A
computationally efficient method is derived to obtain an actuator which aims to
induce the exact structures which are inside the boundary layer, given in terms
of their first spectral proper orthogonal decomposition mode, and an actuator
that maximizes the energy of induced downstream structures. Two free-stream
turbulence levels were evaluated, corresponding to 3.0% and 3.5%, and
closed-loop control is applied in large-eddy simulations of transitional
boundary layers. All three actuators lead to significant delays in the
transition to turbulence and were shown to be robust to mild variations in the
free-stream turbulence levels. Differences are understood in terms of the SPOD
of actuation and FST-induced fields along with the causality of the control
scheme. The actuator optimized to generate the leading downstream SPOD mode,
representing the streaks in the open-loop flow, leads to the highest transition
delay, which can be understood due to its capability of closely cancelling
structures in the boundary layer. However, it is shown that even with the
actuator located downstream of the input measurement it may become impossible
to cancel incoming disturbances in a causal way, depending on the wall-normal
position of the output and on the actuator considered, which limits sensor and
actuator placement capable of good closed-loop performance.

mathematical formalisms for geometric moving interface problems, as well as the
current state-of-the-art of numerical approximations of various phase field

reference closure relationship in order to assess its uncertainty. Even though
this method has been implemented with success in numerous physical scenarios,
it can still suffer from substantial limitations such as the linearity
assumption and the difficulty of properly taking into account the inherent
statistical uncertainty. In the paper, we will extend the CIRCE method in two
aspects. On the one hand, we adopt the Bayesian setting putting prior
probability distributions on the parameters of the (log)-Gaussian distribution.
The posterior distribution of the parameters is then computed with respect to
an experimental database by means of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms. On the other hand, we tackle the more general setting where the
simulations do not move linearly against the multiplicative factor(s). MCMC
algorithms then become time-prohibitive when the thermal-hydraulic simulations
exceed a few minutes. This handicap is overcome by using Gaussian process (GP)
emulators which can yield both reliable and fast predictions of the
simulations. The GP-based MCMC algorithms will be applied to quantify the

Previous studies have demonstrated that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible

addressing the question of the feasibility of a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua in 2024
and beyond. Using the OITS trajectory simulation tool, various scenarios are
analyzed, including a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, a
Jupiter powered flyby, and more complex flyby schemes including a Mars and
Venus flyby. With a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, we
identify a trajectory to 1I/'Oumuamua with a launch date in 2033, a total
velocity increment of 18.2 km/s, and arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2048. With an
additional deep space maneuver before the powered Jupiter flyby, a trajectory
with a launch date in 2030, a total velocity increment of 15.3 km/s, and an
arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2052 were identified. Both launch dates would
provide over a decade for spacecraft development, in contrast to the previously
identified 2020-2021 launch dates. Furthermore, the distance from the Sun at
the Oberth burn is at 5 Solar radii. This results in heat flux values, which
are of the same order of magnitude as for the Parker Solar Probe. We conclude
that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible, using existing and near-term

Airline Network (WAN) is global and has a peculiar construction, the

barely global in its reach. To understand the impact of global distances on
local flows, we map the flow of tourists around the world onto a complex
network and study its topological and dynamical balance. We find that although
the WAN serves as infrastructural support for the ITN, the flow of tourism does
not correlate strongly with the extent of flight connections worldwide.
Instead, unidirectional flows appear locally forming communities that shed
light on global travelling behaviour inasmuch as there is only a 15%
probability of finding bidirectional tourism between a pair of countries. We
conjecture that this is a consequence of one-way cyclic tourism by analyzing
the triangles that are formed by the network of flows in the ITN. Finally, we
find that most tourists travel to neighbouring countries and mainly cover
larger distances when there is a direct flight, irrespective of the time it

characterizing tear film dynamics using non-invasive high speed
videokeratoscopy in assessing the loss of homeostasis of tear film. Methods:
Thirty subjects, from a retrospective study, of which 11 were classified as dry
eye and 19 as normal, were included. High speed videokeratoscopy measurements
were performed using E300 videokeratoscope (Medmont Pty., Ltd, Melbourne,
Australia). Raw data was analyzed using a recently proposed method to estimate
the dynamics of the tear film, based on a fractal dimension approach. This
method provides three time-varying indicators related to the regularity of the
reflected rings: Tear Film Surface Quality (TFSQ) indicator, Breaks Feature
Indicator (BFI) and Distortions Feature Indicator (DFI). From each indicator
five parameters were extracted and analyzed, including non-invasive break up
time, mean value of the indicator in the stability phase, mean value of the
indicator in the whole inter blink interval, mean value of the indicator in the
levelling phase and the general trend of the time series. Receiver Operating
Characteristic were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each
parameter in dry eye detection. Results: The best discrimination performance
between dry eye and normal subjects was achieved with the BFI non-invasive
break up time parameter, with an area under the curve of 0.85. For a cut off
value of 10 s the sensitivity was 100% and the specificity 84%. Conclusions:
The analyzed method improves the assessment of tear film homeostasis in
comparison to previous high speed videokeratoscopy methods showing higher
potential in assisting dry eye diagnosis.

properties of SrMnSb$_2$ single crystals grown by the self-flux method.
Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
transition at $T_{\rm N} = 295(3)$ K. Above $T_{\rm N}$, the susceptibility
slightly increases and forms a broad peak at $T \sim 420$ K, which is a typical
feature of two-dimensional magnetic systems. Neutron diffraction measurements
on single crystals confirm the previously reported C-type AFM structure below
$T_{\rm N}$. Both de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effects
are observed in SrMnSb$_2$ single crystals. Analysis of the oscillatory
component by a Fourier transform shows that the prominent frequencies obtained
by the two different techniques are practically the same within error
regardless of sample size or saturated magnetic moment. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) reveals the existence of stacking faults in the crystals,
which result from a horizontal shift of Sb atomic layers suggesting possible
ordering of Sb vacancies in the crystals. Increase of temperature in
susceptibility measurements leads to the formation of a strong peak at $T \sim
{570}$ K that upon cooling under magnetic field the susceptibility shows a
ferromagnetic transition at $T_{\rm C} \sim 580$ K. Neutron powder diffraction
on crushed single-crystals does not support an FM phase above $T_{\rm N}$.
Furthermore, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements of a single
crystal at the $L_{2,3}$ edge of Mn shows a signal due to induced canting of
AFM moments by the applied magnetic field. All evidence strongly suggests that
a chemical transformation at the surface of single crystals occurs above 500 K
concurrently producing a minute amount of ferromagnetic impurity phase.

situation is deteriorated when $d$ is comparably as large as the number of data

subsampling useless. This paper theoretically justifies the effectiveness of
subsampled Newton methods on high dimensional data. Specifically, we prove only
$\widetilde{\Theta}(d^\gamma_{\rm eff})$ samples are needed in the

$\gamma$-ridge leverage and can be much smaller than $d$ as long as $n\gamma

denotes a healthy P2P market and provides investors more confidence in a

studies that focus on modeling the default rate at the individual level, in
this paper, we are the first to comprehensively explore the monthly trend of
the default rate at the aggregative level for the P2P data from October 2007 to
January 2016 in the US. We use the long short term memory (LSTM) approach to
sequentially predict the default risk of the borrowers in Lending Club, which
is the largest P2P lending platform in the US. Although being first applied in

by outperforming traditionally utilized time series models in our experiments.
Furthermore, incorporating the macroeconomic feature \textit{unemp\_rate}

on both the training and the testing datasets. Our study can broaden the
applications of the LSTM algorithm by using it on the sequential P2P data and

hierarchies are built through the same construction process: start from an
initial class of languages and build new levels using two generic operations.
Concatenation hierarchies have gathered a lot of interest since the 70s, thanks
to an alternate logical definition: each concatenation hierarchy is the
quantification alternation hierarchy within a variant of first-order logic over
words.
  Our goal is to understand such hierarchies. We look at two decision problems:
membership and separation. For a class of languages C, C-separation takes two
regular languages as input and asks whether there exists a third one in C
including the first one and disjoint from the second one. Settling whether
separation is decidable for the levels within a given concatenation hierarchy
is among the most fundamental and challenging questions in formal language
theory. In all prominent cases, it is open, or answered positively for low
levels only. Recently, a breakthrough was made using a generic approach for a
specific kind of hierarchy: those with a finite basis. In this case, separation
is always decidable for levels 1/2, 1 and 3/2.
  Our main theorem is similar but independent: we consider hierarchies with
possibly infinite bases, but that may only contain group languages. An example
is the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic with modular
predicates: its basis consists of languages counting the length of words modulo
some number. Using a generic approach, we show that for any such hierarchy, if
separation is decidable for the basis, then it is decidable for levels up to
3/2. This complements the aforementioned result nicely: all bases considered in
the literature are either finite or made of group languages. Thus, one may
handle the lower levels of any prominent hierarchy in a generic way.

in the problem's parameterized and data complexity, where the query is
considered to be small or fixed, and the database is considered to be large. We
identify two structural parameters for conjunctive queries that capture their
inherent complexity: The dominating star size and the linked matching number.
If the dominating star size of a conjunctive query is large, then we show that
counting solution tuples to the query is at least as hard as counting
dominating sets, which yields a fine-grained complexity lower bound under the
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis as well as a #W[2]-hardness result.
Moreover, if the linked matching number of a conjunctive query is large, then
we show that the structure of the query is so rich that arbitrary queries up to
a certain size can be encoded into it; this essentially establishes
#A[2]-completeness. Using ideas stemming from Lov\'asz, we lift complexity
results from the class of conjunctive queries to arbitrary existential or
universal formulas that might contain inequalities and negations on constraints
over the free variables. As a consequence, we obtain a complexity
classification that generalizes previous results of Chen, Durand, and Mengel

the selection event, whereas the non-selective $p$-value controls it
unconditionally. The selective and non-selective approximately unbiased
$p$-values are computed from two geometric quantities called signed distance
and mean curvature of the region representing tree or edge of interest in the
space of probability distributions. These two geometric quantities are
estimated by fitting a model of scaling-law to the non-parametric multiscale
bootstrap probabilities. Our general method is applicable to a wider class of
problems; phylogenetic tree selection is an example of model selection, and it
is interpreted as the variable selection of multiple regression, where each
edge corresponds to each predictor. Our method is illustrated in a previously
controversial phylogenetic analysis of human, rabbit and mouse.

via a modulational instability (MI) that either saturates monotonically or
leads to oscillations of the ZF energy at the nonlinear stage. This dynamics is
often attributed as the predator--prey oscillations induced by ZF collisional
damping; however, similar dynamics is also observed in collisionless ZFs, in
which case a different mechanism must be involved. Here, we propose a
semi-analytic theory that explains the transition between the oscillations and
saturation of collisionless ZFs within the quasilinear Hasegawa--Mima model. By
analyzing phase-space trajectories of DW quanta (driftons) within the
geometrical-optics (GO) approximation, we argue that the parameter that
controls this transition is $N\sim\gamma_{{\rm MI}}/\omega_{{\rm DW}}$, where
$\gamma_{{\rm MI}}$ is the MI growth rate and $\omega_{{\rm DW}}$ is the linear
DW frequency. We argue that at $N\ll1$, ZFs oscillate due to the presence of
so-called passing drifton trajectories, and we derive an approximate formula
for the ZF amplitude as a function of time in this regime. We also show that at
$N\gtrsim1$, the passing trajectories vanish and ZFs saturate monotonically,
which can be attributed to phase mixing of higher-order sidebands. A
modification of $N$ that accounts for effects beyond the GO limit is also
proposed. These analytic results are tested against both quasilinear and
fully-nonlinear simulations. They also explain the earlier numerical results by

recover an $n \times q$ matrix $X^*$ of rank $r$ from a different and

LRPR with $m \ll n$? A reliable solution can enable fast and low-cost phaseless

solving this LRPR problem. Our proposed algorithm, Alternating Minimization for
Low-Rank Phase Retrieval (AltMinLowRaP), is an AltMin based solution and hence
is also provably fast (converges geometrically). Our guarantee shows that
AltMinLowRaP solves LRPR to $\epsilon$ accuracy, with high probability, as long

standard Gaussian entries, and the right singular vectors of $X^*$ satisfy the
incoherence assumption from matrix completion literature. Here $C$ is a
numerical constant that only depends on the condition number of $X^*$ and on
its incoherence parameter. Its time complexity is only $ C mq nr
\log^2(1/\epsilon)$. Since even the linear (with phase) version of the above
problem is not fully solved, the above result is also the first complete
solution and guarantee for the linear case. Finally, we also develop a simple
extension of our results for the dynamic LRPR setting.

accurate identification of lncRNAs in RNA-seq datasets is crucial for exploring
their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential
computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify them in transcriptomic
data. Well-known CPC tools such as CPC2, lncScore, CPAT are primarily designed

PLIT implements a feature selection method based on L1 regularization and
iterative Random Forests (iRF) classification for selection of optimal

often need to be trained without seeing the test distributions. In this paper
we propose possibly the first framework for addressing distribution change in

basic operations of any digital processor. For adding two integers of N bits
each, the serial adder takes as many clock ticks. For achieving higher speeds,
parallel circuits are discussed in the literature, and these circuits usually
operate in two levels. At the lower level, integers represented by blocks of
smaller number of bits are added, and in a cascade of stages in the next level,
the carries produced in previous addition operations are summed to the augends.
In this paper, we describe a fast method and an improvement of it. The first
attempt resembles the operation method of the merge sort algorithm, from which
some important properties of carries produced in each stage are analysed and
assimilated, resulting in a parallel adder that runs in time comparable to the
existing methods. After that, the crucial insights are brought to fruition in
an improved design, which takes 2 clock ticks to perform the addition operation
requiring only O(square(N)) space. The number of bits N is chosen usually to be
a positive integer power of 2. The speedup is achieved by special purpose
circuits for increment operations by i-th power of 2 , for i = 0, 1, ..., N-1,
each operation taking only a single clock tick to complete. The usefulness of
this adder for multiplication operation is discussed. The standard
multiplication method utilizes quantizer and 3-bit to 2-bit consolidation
circuits to produce an integer that represents in binary the number of 1s in a
column corresponding to a place (weighted coefficient) of nonnegative integer
power of 2. The last two consolidated integers are added by an adder in the

For most of the non-Gaussian statistical models, it is infeasible to find an
analytically tractable solution to estimate the posterior distributions of the
parameters. Recently, an improved framework, namely the extended variational
inference (EVI), has been introduced and applied to derive analytically
tractable solution by employing lower-bound approximation to the variational
objective function. Two conditions required for EVI implementation, namely the
weak condition and the strong condition, are discussed and compared in this
paper. In practical implementation, the convergence of the EVI depends on the
selection of the lower-bound approximation, no matter with the weak condition
or the strong condition. In general, two approximation strategies, the single
lower-bound (SLB) approximation and the multiple lower-bounds (MLB)
approximation, can be applied to carry out the lower-bound approximation. To
clarify the differences between the SLB and the MLB, we will also discuss the
convergence properties of the aforementioned two approximations. Extensive
comparisons are made based on some existing EVI-based non-Gaussian statistical
models. Theoretical analysis are conducted to demonstrate the differences
between the weak and the strong conditions. Qualitative and quantitative
experimental results are presented to show the advantages of the SLB
approximation.

systems. Deep learning models based on the Convolutional and the Recurrent
layers are state-of-the-art in many such tasks. In this paper, we approach
audio classification tasks using capsule networks trained by recently proposed
dynamic routing-by-agreement mechanism. We propose an architecture for capsule
networks fit for audio classification tasks and study the impact of various
parameters on classification accuracy. Further, we suggest modifications for
regularization and multi-label classification. We also develop insights into
the data using capsule outputs and show the utility of the learned network for
transfer learning. We perform experiments on 7 datasets of different domains
and sizes and show significant improvements in performance compared to strong
baseline models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed study
about the application of capsule networks in the audio domain.

observing fluorescein decay rate over time and to understand the relationship
between the newly defined tear fluorescein washout rate (TFWR)and other
measures of the tear film behaviour. Methods: Forty subjects (24F/16M) aged
(mean +/- standard deviation) 31.8 +/- 14.2 years volunteered for the study. It
consisted of the review of medical history, McMonnies questionnaire (McMQ),
slit lamp examination, and TFWR using a newly-developed fluorescein
profilometry. The repeatability of TFWR measurements was assessed. TFWR
estimates were contrasted against patient age, McMQ score, daytime, fluorescein
tear film breakup time (FTBUT), tear meniscus height (TMH) and blink frequency.
Results: Mean repeatability of the method was 28.13 +/- 9.59%. The group mean
TFWR was 39 +/- 23% at 30-s mark after the beginning of measurements, ranging
from 1.4% to 83%. This indicates that TFWR is highly subject-dependent.
Statistically significant correlations were found between the percentage TFWR

No statistically significant correlations were found between TFWR and age,

clinicians to follow dynamic changes in the tear film on the entire ocular
surface and may be used for qualitative assessment of the tear film dynamics.

determining tear film stability can be addressed by estimating the fractal
dimension of the reflected pattern. The method is tested on 39 normal subjects.
The results of the fractal dimension approach are compared with those obtained
using previously proposed automated method, based on a gray level co-occurrence
matrix approach, and with subjective results obtained by two operators which
were assessing the video recordings in ideal conditions. Results: fractal
dimension method was less affected by eye movements and changes in the
videokeratoscopic image background than gray level co-occurrence matrix method.
Median difference of the non-invasive break-up time between manual and
automated methods was 0.03 s (IQR = 4.47 s.) and 0.0 s (IQR = 2.22 s.) for gray
level co-occurrence matrix and fractal dimension approaches, respectively.
Correlation coefficient with manual non-invasive break-up time was r2 = 0.86 (p
< 0.001) for gray level co-occurrence matrix approach, and r2 = 0.82 (p <
0.001) for fractal dimension approach. Significant statistical difference was
found between non-invasive break-up measurements of manual and gray level

the potential to characterize tear film dynamics in more detail compared to

for achieving better system intelligence. This paper considers the design and
implementation of a practical privacy-preserving collaborative learning scheme,
in which a curious learning coordinator trains a better machine learning model
based on the data samples contributed by a number of IoT objects, while the
confidentiality of the raw forms of the training data is protected against the
coordinator. Existing distributed machine learning and data encryption
approaches incur significant computation and communication overhead, rendering
them ill-suited for resource-constrained IoT objects. We study an approach that
applies independent Gaussian random projection at each IoT object to obfuscate
data and trains a deep neural network at the coordinator based on the projected
data from the IoT objects. This approach introduces light computation overhead
to the IoT objects and moves most workload to the coordinator that can have
sufficient computing resources. Although the independent projections performed
by the IoT objects address the potential collusion between the curious
coordinator and some compromised IoT objects, they significantly increase the
complexity of the projected data. In this paper, we leverage the superior
learning capability of deep learning in capturing sophisticated patterns to
maintain good learning performance. Extensive comparative evaluation shows that
this approach outperforms other lightweight approaches that apply additive
noisification for differential privacy and/or support vector machines for
learning in the applications with light data pattern complexities.

risk factor for CVD events is the amount of coronary artery calcium (CAC). To
meet demands of the increasing interest in quantification of CAC, i.e. coronary
calcium scoring, especially as an unrequested finding for screening and
research, automatic methods have been proposed. Current automatic calcium
scoring methods are relatively computationally expensive and only provide
scores for one type of CT. To address this, we propose a computationally
efficient method that employs two ConvNets: the first performs registration to
align the fields of view of input CTs and the second performs direct regression
of the calcium score, thereby circumventing time-consuming intermediate CAC
segmentation. Optional decision feedback provides insight in the regions that
contributed to the calcium score. Experiments were performed using 903 cardiac
CT and 1,687 chest CT scans. The method predicted calcium scores in less than
0.3 s. Intra-class correlation coefficient between predicted and manual calcium
scores was 0.98 for both cardiac and chest CT. The method showed almost perfect
agreement between automatic and manual CVD risk categorization in both
datasets, with a linearly weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.95 in cardiac CT and 0.93
in chest CT. Performance is similar to that of state-of-the-art methods, but
the proposed method is hundreds of times faster. By providing visual feedback,
insight is given in the decision process, making it readily implementable in

question, how significantly the area selection could impact the mitotic count,
which has a known high inter-rater disagreement. On a data set of 32 whole
slide images of H&E-stained canine cutaneous mast cell tumor, fully annotated

board-certified, three in training) to select a field of interest for the
mitotic count. To assess the potential difference on the mitotic count, we
compared the mitotic count of the selected regions to the overall distribution
on the slide.Additionally, we evaluated three deep learning-based methods for
the assessment of highest mitotic density: In one approach, the model would
directly try to predict the mitotic count for the presented image patches as a
regression task. The second method aims at deriving a segmentation mask for
mitotic figures, which is then used to obtain a mitotic density. Finally, we
evaluated a two-stage object-detection pipeline based on state-of-the-art
architectures to identify individual mitotic figures. We found that the
predictions by all models were, on average, better than those of the experts.
The two-stage object detector performed best and outperformed most of the human
pathologists on the majority of tumor cases. The correlation between the
predicted and the ground truth mitotic count was also best for this approach
(0.963 to 0.979). Further, we found considerable differences in position
selection between pathologists, which could partially explain the high variance

field-free electrostatic potential delivered by a spherical shell causes a
force upon a moving electrical charge in the center of that shell. This force
can be interpreted as a result of the change in inertial mass of the charge. In
order to prove this theory, Mikhailov published two type of experimental
setups: One using vacuum cathode tube and another using glow-discharge-lamps to
generate oscillating and accelerating electrons. Whereas the glow-discharge
experiment was already evaluated by several groups, here we are focusing on
replicating the vacuum tube configuration. Under right circumstances, electrons
inside a vacuum tube start to oscillate around a grid electrode, which is
called Barkhausen-Kurz oscillations. However, we found that Mikhailov's setup
does not produce these kind of oscillations and therefore the theory that he
applied in the interpretation of his measurements is not correct. We succeeded
in generating Barkhausen-Kurz oscillations with a different vacuum tube and
found no frequency shifts below an order of magnitude of Assis's prediction by
operating the tube inside a charged spherical shell that would indicate a
change in the electron's mass. However, since both the mass as well as the
geometry factor of the electron cloud contribute to the oscillator frequency,
we believe that this setup is not suitable to investigate Weber-type
electrodynamic effects.

with the stacked electron gas density profile corrected for clumpiness. The
first analysis gives results in good agreement with those reported in
Ghirardini et al. (2018): a modest presence of the nonthermal support and an
entropy profile that follows at distances beyond r500 the predicted power law
increase with slope 1.1. On the contrary, the results of the second analysis
are consistent with the findings obtained by the Suzaku observations, steep
temperature and flat entropy profiles, with a higher level of the nonthermal

tasks. Most real-time data streams vary dynamically with time and incremental
quantile estimators document state-of-the art performance to track quantiles of
such data streams. However, most are not able to make joint estimates of
multiple quantiles in a consistent manner, and estimates may violate the
monotone property of quantiles. In this paper we propose the general concept of
*conditional quantiles* that can extend incremental estimators to jointly track
multiple quantiles. We apply the concept to propose two new estimators.
Extensive experimental results, on both synthetic and real-life data, show that
the new estimators clearly outperform legacy state-of-the-art joint quantile

the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of speech is maximized for one microphone

is fed into an ASR system. For ASR, we use a system developed by our group and
compare its performance with and without the support from SSL. We test our SSL

in recommendation systems, therefore the proportion of unstructured multimodal
data like text, image and video is increasing. However, due to the
representation gap between different modalities, it is intractable to
effectively use unstructured multimodal data to improve the efficiency of
recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Multimodal
Interest-Related Item Similarity model (Multimodal IRIS) to provide
recommendations based on multimodal data source. Specifically, the Multimodal
IRIS model consists of three modules, i.e., multimodal feature learning module,
the Interest-Related Network (IRN) module and item similarity recommendation
module. The multimodal feature learning module adds knowledge sharing unit
among different modalities. Then IRN learn the interest relevance between
target item and different historical items respectively. At last, the
multimodal data feature learning, IRN and item similarity recommendation
modules are unified into an integrated system to achieve performance
enhancements and to accommodate the addition or absence of different modal
data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, by dealing with
the multimodal data which people may pay more attention to when selecting
items, the proposed Multimodal IRIS significantly improves accuracy and
interpretability on top-N recommendation task over the state-of-the-art
methods.

mechanism has been widely used in the recommender system, especially on the
mobile Apps. The feed streaming setting provides users the interactive manner
of recommendation in never-ending feeds. In such an interactive manner, a good
recommender system should pay more attention to user stickiness, which is far
beyond classical instant metrics, and typically measured by {\bf long-term user
engagement}. Directly optimizing the long-term user engagement is a non-trivial
problem, as the learning target is usually not available for conventional
supervised learning methods. Though reinforcement learning~(RL) naturally fits
the problem of maximizing the long term rewards, applying RL to optimize
long-term user engagement is still facing challenges: user behaviors are
versatile and difficult to model, which typically consists of both instant
feedback~(e.g. clicks, ordering) and delayed feedback~(e.g. dwell time,
revisit); in addition, performing effective off-policy learning is still
immature, especially when combining bootstrapping and function approximation.
  To address these issues, in this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning
framework --- FeedRec to optimize the long-term user engagement. FeedRec
includes two components: 1)~a Q-Network which designed in hierarchical LSTM
takes charge of modeling complex user behaviors, and 2)~an S-Network, which
simulates the environment, assists the Q-Network and voids the instability of
convergence in policy learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a
real-world large scale data show that FeedRec effectively optimizes the
long-term user engagement and outperforms state-of-the-arts.

according to the frequency of word occurrences, establishing a power-law decay
for the frequency vs rank relation. This law is a robust statistical property
observed even in ancient untranslated languages. Interestingly, this law seems
to be also manifested in music records when several metrics---functioning as
words in written texts---are used. Even though music can be regarded as a
language, finding an accurate equivalent of the concept of words in music is
difficult because it lacks a functional semantic. This raises the question of
which is the appropriate choice of Zipfian units in music, which is extensive
to other contexts where this law can emerge. In particular, this is still an
open question in written texts, where several alternatives have been proposed
as Zipfian units besides the canonical use of words. Seeking to validate a
natural election of Zipfian units in music, in this work we find that Zipf's
law emerges when a combination of chords and notes are chosen as Zipfian units.
Our results are grounded on a consistent analysis of the statistical properties
of music and texts, complemented with theoretical considerations that combine
different reference models, including a simple model inspired in the Lempel-Ziv
compression algorithm that we have devised to explain the emergence of Zipf's
law as the consequence of languages evolving into more efficient forms of

visualize datasets having many characteristics of multilayer graphs. This
report provides a state of the art and a structured analysis of contemporary
multilayer network visualization, not only for researchers in visualization,
but also for those who aim to visualize multilayer networks in the domain of
complex systems, as well as those developing systems across application
domains. We have explored the visualization literature to survey visualization
techniques suitable for multilayer graph visualization, as well as tools,
tasks, and analytic techniques from within application domains. This report
also identifies the outstanding challenges for multilayer graph visualization
and suggests future research directions for addressing them.

In this paper, we firstly establish a new sentence compression model based on
the probability model and the parse tree model. Our sentence compression model
is equivalent to an integer linear program (ILP) which can both guarantee the
syntax correctness of the compression and save the main meaning. We propose
using a DC (Difference of convex) programming approach (DCA) for finding local
optimal solution of our model. Combing DCA with a parallel-branch-and-bound

the good quality of our sentence compression model and the excellent

compression and normal stress in a material, by measuring how a compression
wave evolves as it propagates through different thicknesses of the sample
material. The compression wave is generally measured by Doppler velocimetry
from a surface that can be observed with optical or near-optical photons. For
high-pressure ramp loading, the reflectivity of a free surface often decreases
as it is accelerated by the ramp wave, and window materials transparent to the
probing photons are used to keep the surface flatter and preserve its
reflectivity. We previously described a method of analyzing ramp-wave data
measured at the free surface which did not require numerical iteration.
However, this method breaks down when the pressure at the surface changes and
hence cannot be used for data taken with a finite-impedance window. We have now
generalized this non-iterative analysis method to apply to measurements taken
through a window. Free surfaces can be treated seamlessly, and the need for
sampling at uniform intervals of velocity has been removed. These calculations
require interpolation of partially-released states using the
partially-constructed stress-compression relation, making them slower than the
previous free-surface scheme, but they are still much more robust and fast than
iterative analysis.

experimental techniques able to provide sub-nanometer scale information on
interfaces buried between millimeters of materials. Yet, a strong interest
exists improving the modeling of contact mechanics of materials in order to
adjust their interface properties (e.g. thermal transport, friction). We show
here that the essential features of the residual gap between contacting
surfaces can be measured using high energy X-ray synchrotron reflectivity. The
presence of this nano-gap is general to the contact of solids. In some special
case however, it can be removed when attractive forces take over repulsive
contributions, depending on both height and wavelength of asperity
distributions (roughness). A criterion for this instability is established in
the standard case of van der Waals attractive forces and elastic asperity
compression repulsive forces (Hertz model). This collapse instability is
confirmed experimentally in the case of silicon direct bonding, using
high-energy X-ray synchrotron reflectivity and adhesion energy measurements.
The possibility to achieve fully closed interfaces at room temperature opens
interesting perspectives to build stronger assemblies with smaller thermal
budgets.

images from damaged buildings to obtain lessons and gain knowledge from the
event. Images of damaged buildings and components provide valuable evidence to
understand the consequences on our structures. However, in many cases, images
of damaged buildings are often captured without sufficient spatial context.
Also, they may be hard to recognize in cases with severe damage. Incorporating
past images showing a pre-disaster condition of such buildings is helpful to
accurately evaluate possible circumstances related to a building's failure. One
of the best resources to observe the pre-disaster condition of the buildings is
Google Street View. A sequence of 360 panorama images which are captured along
streets enables all-around views at each location on the street. Once a user
knows the GPS information near the building, all external views of the building
can be made available. In this study, we develop an automated technique to
extract past building images from 360 panorama images serviced by Google Street
View. Users only need to provide a geo-tagged image, collected near the target
building, and the rest of the process is fully automated. High-quality and
undistorted building images are extracted from past panoramas. Since the
panoramas are collected from various locations near the building along the
street, the user can identify its pre-disaster conditions from the full set of
external views.

  poisoning",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Backdoor attacks against CNNs represent a new threat against deep learning
systems, due to the possibility of corrupting the training set so to induce an
incorrect behaviour at test time. To avoid that the trainer recognises the
presence of the corrupted samples, the corruption of the training set must be
as stealthy as possible. Previous works have focused on the stealthiness of the
perturbation injected into the training samples, however they all assume that
the labels of the corrupted samples are also poisoned. This greatly reduces the
stealthiness of the attack, since samples whose content does not agree with the
label can be identified by visual inspection of the training set or by running
a pre-classification step. In this paper we present a new backdoor attack
without label poisoning Since the attack works by corrupting only samples of
the target class, it has the additional advantage that it does not need to
identify beforehand the class of the samples to be attacked at test time.
Results obtained on the MNIST digits recognition task and the traffic signs
classification task show that backdoor attacks without label poisoning are
indeed possible, thus raising a new alarm regarding the use of deep learning in
security-critical applications.

silver for instance, in soil using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).
The major concern is the matrix effect. Although it affects the accuracy of
LIBS measurements in a general way, the effect appears accentuated for soil
because of large variation of chemical and physical properties among different
soils. The purpose is to reduce its influence in such way an accurate and
soil-independent calibration model can be constructed. At the same time, the
developed model should efficiently reduce experimental fluctuations affecting
measurement precision. A univariate model first reveals obvious influence of
matrix effect and important experimental fluctuation. A multivariate model has
been then developed. A key point is the introduction of generalized spectrum
where variables representing the soil type are explicitly included. Machine
learning has been used to develop the model. After a necessary pretreatment
where a feature selection process reduces the dimension of raw spectrum
accordingly to the number of available spectra, the data have been fed in to a
back-propagation neuronal networks (BPNN) to train and validate the model. The
resulted soilindependent calibration model allows average relative error of
calibration (REC) and average relative error of prediction (REP) within the
range of 5-6%.
