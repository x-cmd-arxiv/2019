all-normal-dispersion (ANDi) fiber is predicted to offer completely coherent
broadening mechanisms, potentially allowing for substantially reduced noise
levels in comparison to those obtained when operating in the anomalous
dispersion regime. However, previous studies of SC noise typically treat only
the quantum noise, typically in the form of one-photon-per-mode noise, and do
not consider other technical noise contributions, such as the stability of the
pump laser, which become important when the broadening mechanism itself is
coherent. In this work, we discuss the influence of the amplitude and pulse
length noise of the pump laser, both added separately and combined. We show
that for a typical mode-locked laser, in which the peak power and pulse
duration are anticorrelated, their combined impact on the SC noise is generally
smaller than in isolation. This means that the supercontinuum noise is smaller
than the noise of the mode-locked pump laser itself, a fact that was recently
observed in experiments but not explained. Our detailed numerical analysis
shows that the coherence of ANDi SC generation is considerably reduced on the
spectral edges when realistic pump laser noise levels are taken into account.

transitions to sustain atypical fluctuations of dynamical observables such as
the current or the activity. This leads in some cases to symmetry-broken
space-time trajectories which enhance the probability of such events due to the
emergence of ordered structures. Despite their conceptual and practical
importance, these dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) at the trajectory level
are difficult to characterize due to the low probability of their occurrence.
However, during the last decade advanced computational techniques have been
developed to measure rare events in simulations of many-particle systems that
allow for the first time the direct observation and characterization of these
DPTs. Here we review the application of a particular rare-event simulation
technique, based on cloning Monte Carlo methods, to characterize DPTs in
paradigmatic stochastic lattice gases. In particular, we describe in detail
some tricks and tips of the trade, paying special attention to the measurement
of order parameters capturing the physics of the different DPTs, as well as to
the finite-size effects (both in the system size and number of clones) that
affect the measurements. Overall, we provide a consistent picture of the

small bodies in situ, leading to major advances in our understanding of their
geological and geophysical properties. These missions, however, have had a
limited number of targets. Among them, the NASA Dawn mission has characterised
in detail the topography and albedo variegation across the surface of asteroid
(4) Vesta down to a spatial resolution of approximately 20 m/pixel scale.
  Aims. Here our aim was to determine how much topographic and albedo
information can be retrieved from the ground with VLT/SPHERE in the case of
Vesta, having a former space mission (Dawn) providing us with the ground truth
that can be used as a benchmark.
  Methods. We observed Vesta with VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL as part of our ESO large
programme (ID 199.C-0074) at six different epochs, and deconvolved the
collected images with a parametric point spread function (PSF). We then
compared our images with synthetic views of Vesta generated from the 3D shape
model of the Dawn mission, on which we projected Vesta's albedo information.
  Results. We show that the deconvolution of the VLT/SPHERE images with a
parametric PSF allows the retrieval of the main topographic and albedo features
present across the surface of Vesta down to a spatial resolution of
approximately 20-30 km. Contour extraction shows an accuracy of approximately 1
pixel (3.6 mas). The present study provides the very first quantitative
estimate of the accuracy of ground-based adaptive-optics imaging observations
of asteroid surfaces.
  Conclusions. In the case of Vesta, the upcoming generation of 30-40m
telescopes (ELT, TMT, GMT) should in principle be able to resolve all of the
main features present across its surface, including the troughs and the
north-south crater dichotomy, provided that they operate at the diffraction
limit.

perform a successful attack by either reducing her distance to the receiver, or

Lorentz-invariant formulation of quantum theory. The idea is to postulate a
final boundary condition: in effect, a late-time distribution of mass-energy
recording how photons scattered off macroscopic objects. Nature selects this
final boundary condition with the orthodox late-time Born probability; and this
defines the probability space of events, to give a realist quantum theory. We
emphasize two topics. First, we consider this formulation's verdicts about
traditional locality conditions, such as Outcome Independence and Parameter
Independence. Second, we discuss a possible amendment to Kent's proposal that,
roughly speaking, allows for the emergence of a quasiclassical history even
when mass-energy is shielded or delayed from appearing in the final boundary
condition.

${}^1S_0$ and ${}^3S_1$, we present the neutron-proton scattering phase shifts

effects stemming from the lattice artifacts partially cancel those caused by
the nonlocal smearing parameter. Due to this cancellation, the Galilean
invariance breaking effect is small, and the Galilean invariance can be
restored by introducing Galilean invariance restoration operators.

understand their ability to grow via accretion and to pair in close binaries
during galactic mergers. To properly follow the dynamics of black holes we
develop a physically motivated model to capture unresolved dynamical friction
from stars, dark matter and gas. We first validate the model and then we use it
to investigate the dynamics of seed black holes born at $z\sim9$ in dwarf
proto-galaxies. We perform a suite of zoom cosmological simulations with
spatial resolution as high as 10 pc and with a stellar and dark matter mass
resolution of $2\times10^3 \, \textrm{M}_\odot$ and $2\times10^5 \,
\textrm{M}_\odot$ respectively. We first explore the dynamics of a seed black
hole in the galaxy where it is born and show that it is highly erratic if the
seed mass is less than $10^5\, \textrm{M}_\odot$. The dynamics is dominated by
the stellar component, whose distribution is irregular and patchy, thus
inducing stochasticity in the orbits: the black hole may be anywhere in the
proto-galaxy. When this dwarf merges into a larger galaxy, it is paramount to
simulate the process with very high spatial and mass resolution in order to
correctly account for the stripping of the stellar envelope of the satellite
black hole. The outcome of the encounter could be either a tight binary or, at
least temporary, a wandering black hole, leading to multiple black holes in a
galaxy, each inherited from a different merger.

pressure differences, a meteorological parameter distinct from temperature and

assumption is uncertain. We find lower bounds on the characteristic time scale
of change of the sea level pressure variance and its differences between
consecutive days. Depending on assumptions about the uncertainties of the mean

lower bounds on the time scales of change of the variances range from $\sim
100$ to several thousand years. Trends in the variance of day-to-day pressure

large amounts of manually annotated data for supervised training. Few-shot
learning aims to address this shortcoming by learning a new class from a few
annotated support examples. We introduce, a novel few-shot framework, for the
segmentation of volumetric medical images with only a few annotated slices.
Compared to other related works in computer vision, the major challenges are
the absence of pre-trained networks and the volumetric nature of medical scans.
We address these challenges by proposing a new architecture for few-shot
segmentation that incorporates 'squeeze & excite' blocks. Our two-armed
architecture consists of a conditioner arm, which processes the annotated
support input and generates a task-specific representation. This representation
is passed on to the segmenter arm that uses this information to segment the new
query image. To facilitate efficient interaction between the conditioner and
the segmenter arm, we propose to use 'channel squeeze & spatial excitation'
blocks - a light-weight computational module - that enables heavy interaction
between both the arms with negligible increase in model complexity. This
contribution allows us to perform image segmentation without relying on a
pre-trained model, which generally is unavailable for medical scans.
Furthermore, we propose an efficient strategy for volumetric segmentation by
optimally pairing a few slices of the support volume to all the slices of the
query volume. We perform experiments for organ segmentation on whole-body
contrast-enhanced CT scans from the Visceral Dataset. Our proposed model
outperforms multiple baselines and existing approaches with respect to the
segmentation accuracy by a significant margin. The source code is available at

radius less than 3 Earth radii ($R_\oplus$) range from low-density sub-Neptunes
containing volatile elements to higher density rocky planets with Earth-like or
iron-rich (Mercury-like) compositions. Such astonishing diversity in observed
small exoplanet compositions may be the product of different initial conditions
of the planet-formation process and/or different evolutionary paths that
altered the planetary properties after formation. Planet evolution may be
especially affected by either photoevaporative mass loss induced by high
stellar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux or giant impacts. Although
there is some evidence for the former, there are no unambiguous findings so far
about the occurrence of giant impacts in an exoplanet system. Here, we
characterize the two innermost planets of the compact and near-resonant system
Kepler-107. We show that they have nearly identical radii (about
$1.5-1.6~R_\oplus$), but the outer planet Kepler-107c is more than twice as
dense (about $12.6~\rm g\,cm^{-3}$) as the innermost Kepler-107b (about
$5.3~\rm g\,cm^{-3}$). In consequence, Kepler-107c must have a larger iron core
fraction than Kepler-107b. This imbalance cannot be explained by the stellar
XUV irradiation, which would conversely make the more-irradiated and
less-massive planet Kepler-107b denser than Kepler-107c. Instead, the
dissimilar densities are consistent with a giant impact event on Kepler-107c
that would have stripped off part of its silicate mantle. This hypothesis is
supported by theoretical predictions from collisional mantle stripping, which
match the mass and radius of Kepler-107c.

We discuss how using multi-wavelength millimeter measurements can refine plasma
analysis through knowledge of the absorption mechanisms. Here we use sub-band
observations from the publicly available science verification (SV) data, whilst
our methodology will also be applicable to regular ALMA data. The spectral
resolving capacity of ALMA SV data is tested using the enhancement coincident
with an X-ray Bright Point (XBP) and from a plasmoid ejection event near active
region NOAA12470 observed in Band 3 (84-116 GHz) on 17/12/2015. We compute the
interferometric brightness temperature light-curve for both features at each of
the four constituent sub-bands to find the logarithmic millimetre spectrum. We
compared the observed logarithmic spectral gradient with the derived
relationship with optical thickness for an isothermal plasma to estimate the
structure's optical thicknesses. We conclude, within 90% confidence, that the
stationary enhancement has an optical thickness between $0.02 \leq \tau \leq
2.78$, and that the moving enhancement has $0.11 \leq \tau \leq 2.78$, thus
both lie near to the transition between optically thin and thick plasma at 100

brightness temperatures would be expected to have electron temperatures of
$\sim 7370 - 15300$ K for the stationary enhancement and between $\sim 7440 -

largely dyadic. To capture the normative qualities of interaction more

Convening important insights in existing HRI work around topics like touch,

expectations that can shape how a robot acts in social space. By sorting
various kinds of consent through social and legal doctrine, we delineate
empirical and technical questions to meet consent challenges faced in major

computing capacity in periods when their need arises. An approach is to provide
both on-demand and spot services on shared servers. The former allows users to
access servers on demand at a fixed price and users occupy different periods of
servers. The latter allows users to bid for the remaining unoccupied periods
via dynamic pricing; however, without appropriate design, such periods may be
arbitrarily small since on-demand users arrive randomly. This is also the
current service model adopted by Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute. In this paper,
we provide the first integral framework for sharing the time of servers between
on-demand and spot services while optimally pricing spot instances. It
guarantees that on-demand users can get served quickly while spot users can
stably utilize servers for a properly long period once accepted, which is a key
feature to make both on-demand and spot services accessible. Simulation results
show that, by complementing the on-demand market with a spot market, a cloud
provider can improve revenue by up to 464.7%. The framework is designed under
assumptions which are met in real environments. It is a new tool that cloud
operators can use to quantify the advantage of a hybrid spot and on-demand
service, eventually making the case for operating such service model in their
own infrastructures.

answer this question through an observational study of usage and citation data
collected about the multidisciplinary, open access mega-journal Scientific
Reports. This observational study answers these questions using the following
methods: an overlap analysis of most read and top-cited articles; Spearman
correlation tests between total citation counts over two years and usage over
various timeframes; a comparison of first months of citation for most read and
all articles; a Wilcoxon test on the distribution of total citations of early
cited articles and the distribution of total citations of all other articles.
All analyses were performed using the programming language R. As Scientific
Reports is a multidisciplinary journal covering all natural and clinical
sciences, we also looked at the differences across subjects. We found a
moderate correlation between usage in the first year and citations in the first
two years since publication, and that articles with high usage in the first 6
months are more likely to have their first citation earlier (Wilcoxon=1811500,
p < 0.0001), which is also related to higher citations in the first two years
(Wilcoxon=8071200, p < 0.0001). As this final assertion is inferred based on
the results of the other elements of this paper, it requires further analysis.
Moreover, our choice of a 2 year window for our analysis did not consider the
articles' citation half-life, and our use of Scientific Reports (a journal that
is atypical compared to most academic journals) as the source of the articles
analysed has likely played a role in our findings, and so analysing a longer
timeframe and carrying out similar analysis on a different journal (or group of

  driving scenarios",,,"10.1016/j.physa.2019.123393",,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been considerable interest in the active maneuvers made by a small
number of vehicles to improve macroscopic traffic flows. Jam-absorption driving
(JAD) is a single vehicle's maneuvers to remove a wide moving jam and consists
of two actions. First, a vehicle upstream of the jam slows down and maintains a
low velocity. Because it cuts off the supply of vehicles to the jam, the jam
shrinks and finally disappears. Second, it returns to following the vehicle
ahead of it. One of the critical problems of JAD is the occurrence of secondary
jams. The perturbations caused by JAD actions may grow into secondary jams due
to the instability of traffic flows. The occurrence of secondary jams was
investigated by numerical simulations in non-periodic systems where only
human-driven vehicles are placed upstream of the vehicle performing JAD.
However, no theoretical condition has been proposed to restrict secondary jams
in these systems. This paper presents a theoretical condition restricting
secondary jams in a semi-infinite system composed of a vehicle performing JAD
and the other human-driven vehicles obeying a car-following model on a
non-periodic and single-lane road. In constructing this condition, we apply the
linear string stability to a macroscopic spatiotemporal structure of JAD.
Numerical simulations show that a finite version of this condition restricts
secondary jams. Moreover, under this condition, we demonstrate that it is
possible to restrict secondary jams in the semi-infinite system under wide
ranges of the parameters of the system. Furthermore, we construct the
conditions suppressing secondary jams in other semi-infinite systems with
inflows from other lanes or a bottleneck, and demonstrate that JAD can restrict
secondary jams in these systems. Thus, our method theoretically guarantees that
a single vehicle can improve macroscopic traffic flows.

the dynamical structure factor, $D({\bf q}, \omega)$, from the displacement
field $x({\bf r}, t)$. We observe four regimes with increasing temperature,
$T$, classified in relation to the charge ordering temperature, $T_c$, and the
`polaron formation' temperature $T_P$, with $ T_c \ll T_P$. For $T \ll T_c$ the
oscillations are harmonic, leading to dispersive phonons, with increasing $T$
bringing in anharmonic, momentum dependent, corrections. For $T \sim T_c$,
thermal tunneling events of the $x({\bf r})$ field occur, with a propagating
`domain' pattern at wavevector ${\bf q} \sim (\pi, \pi)$ and low energy weight
in $D({\bf q}, \omega)$. When $T_c < T < T_P$, the disordered polaron regime,
domain structures vanish, the dispersion narrows, and low energy weight is
lost. For $T \gtrsim T_P$ we essentially have uncorrelated local oscillations.

three-dimensional with instabilities, convection, and turbulence playing
crucial roles in aiding neutrino-driven explosions. Simulations of CCNSe
including accurate treatments of neutrino transport and sufficient resolution
to capture key instabilities remain amongst the most expensive numerical
simulations in astrophysics, prohibiting large parameter studies in 2D and 3D.
Studies spanning a large swath of the incredibly varied initial conditions of
CCSNe are possible in 1D, though such simulations must be artificially driven
to explode. We present a new method for including the most important effects of
convection and turbulence in 1D simulations of neutrino-driven CCSNe, called
Supernova Turbulence In Reduced-dimensionality, or STIR. Our new approach
includes crucial terms resulting from the turbulent and convective motions of
the flow. We estimate the strength of convection and turbulence using a
modified mixing length theory (MLT) approach introducing a few free parameters
to the model which are fit to the results of 3D simulations. For sufficiently
large values of the mixing length parameter, turbulence-aided neutrino-driven
explosions are obtained. We compare the results of STIR to high-fidelity 3D
simulations and perform a parameter study of CCSN explosion using 200
solar-metallicity progenitor models from 9 to 120 $M_\odot$. We find that STIR
is a better predictor of which models will explode in multidimensional
simulations than other methods of driving explosions in 1D. We also present a
preliminary investigation of predicted observable characteristics of the CCSN
population from STIR, such as the distributions of explosion energies and
remnant masses.

complex photometric and spectroscopic behaviours. They exhibit mass-loss
variations and experience different types of oscillation modes, and there is
growing evidence that variable stellar winds and photospheric pulsations are
closely related. To discuss the wind properties and variability of evolved
B-type stars, we derive new stellar and wind parameters for a sample of 19
Galactic BSGs by fitting theoretical line profiles of H, He, and Si to the
observed ones and compare them with previous determinations. The mass-loss rate
of three stars has been obtained for the first time. All stars follow the known
empirical wind momentum-luminosity relationships, and the late BSGs show the
trend of the mid BSGs. We find an empirical relationship that associates the
amplitude of mass-loss variations with photometric/spectroscopic variability on
timescales of tens of days. We find that stars located on the cool side of the
bi-stability jump show a decrease in the terminal and escape velocities ratio,
while their corresponding mass-loss rates are similar to or lower than the
values found for stars on the hot side. Particularly, for those variable stars
a decrease in the terminal and escape velocities ratio is accompanied by a
decrease in the mass-loss rate. Our results also suggest that radial pulsation
modes with periods longer than 6 days might be responsible for the wind
variability in the mid/late-type BSGs. These radial modes might be identified
with strange modes, which are known to facilitate (enhanced) mass loss. On the
other hand, we propose that the wind behaviour of stars on the cool side of the
bi-stability jump could fit with predictions of the delta-slow hydrodynamics
solution for radiation-driven winds with highly variable ionization.

parameters, which fully absorb the information about the background cluster
potential and the binary's orbit within it: a dimensional parameter $A$ setting
the secular timescale, and a dimensionless parameter $\Gamma$ which determines
the phase portrait of the binary's inner orbital evolution. We examine the
dependence of $A$ and $\Gamma$ on cluster potential (both spherical and
axisymmetric) and on the binary orbit within the cluster. Our theory reproduces
known secular results - such as Lidov-Kozai evolution and the effect of the
Galactic tide on Oort Cloud comets - in appropriate limits, but is more

because the dynamics are qualitatively changed by bifurcations at $\Gamma =

period of the binary around the cluster by $\gtrsim 10-10^2$ (depending on the

  IEEE, 2019","10.1109/SP.2019.00073",,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of measuring how much a system reveals about its
secret inputs. We work under the black-box setting: we assume no prior
knowledge of the system's internals, and we run the system for choices of
secrets and measure its leakage from the respective outputs. Our goal is to
estimate the Bayes risk, from which one can derive some of the most popular
leakage measures (e.g., min-entropy, additive, and multiplicative leakage). The
state-of-the-art method for estimating these leakage measures is the
frequentist paradigm, which approximates the system's internals by looking at
the frequencies of its inputs and outputs. Unfortunately, this does not scale
for systems with large output spaces, where it would require too many
input-output examples. Consequently, it also cannot be applied to systems with
continuous outputs (e.g., time side channels, network traffic). In this paper,
we exploit an analogy between Machine Learning (ML) and black-box leakage
estimation to show that the Bayes risk of a system can be estimated by using a
class of ML methods: the universally consistent learning rules; these rules can
exploit patterns in the input-output examples to improve the estimates'
convergence, while retaining formal optimality guarantees. We focus on a set of
them, the nearest neighbor rules; we show that they significantly reduce the
number of black-box queries required for a precise estimation whenever nearby
outputs tend to be produced by the same secret; furthermore, some of them can
tackle systems with continuous outputs. We illustrate the applicability of
these techniques on both synthetic and real-world data, and we compare them
with the state-of-the-art tool, leakiEst, which is based on the frequentist
approach.

the defects supporting the zero-energy modes. With numerical simulations, we
demonstrate that the gate is robust against hopping disorder but is corrupted
by disorder in the on-site energy. Then we show that this robustness is
topological protection, and that it arises as a joint consequence of chiral
symmetry, time-reversal symmetry and the spatial separation of the zero-energy
modes bound to the defects. This setup will most likely not lead to a practical
quantum computer, nevertheless it does provide valuable insight to aspects of
topological quantum computing as an elementary minimal model. Since this model
is non-interacting and non-superconducting, its dynamics can be studied
experimentally, e.g., using coupled optical waveguides.

SNe that occur in preexisting bubbles destroy less dust as the destruction is

times longer than the estimate based on results from a single SN explosion. We
investigate the evolution of the dust-to-gas mass ratio (DGR), and find that a
spatial inhomogeneity of $\sim$ 14\% develops for scales below 10 pc. It
locally correlates positively with gas density but negatively with gas
temperature even in the exterior of the bubbles due to incomplete gas mixing.

in diamond suspension and subsequently overgrown with a diamond film by
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. With dip-seeding only, the seeding
density declines towards the tip apex due to seed migration during solvent
evaporation. The migration of seeds can be counteracted by nitrogen gas flow
towards the apex, which makes coating of the apex with nanometer-thin diamond
possible. At moderate gas flow, diamond grows homogeneously at shaft and apex

ideal absorber materials in photovoltaic applications are also beneficial in
photon upconversion devices. In this contribution, we investigate the
rubrene-triplet sensitization by perovskite thin films based on methylammonium
formamidinium lead triiodide (MAFA). To elucidate the role of trap states which
affect the free carrier lifetimes, we fabricate MAFA perovskite thin films with
three different thicknesses. By measuring the change in the photoluminescence
properties under different excitation fluences, we find that the prevalent
recombination mechanism shifts from monomolecular for thinner films to
bimolecular recombination for thicker MAFA films, indicating a reduction in
shallow trap-assisted recombination. The addition of rubrene shows a
passivating effect on the MAFA surface, but adds an additional quenching
pathway due to charge transfer to the triplet state of rubrene. We observe that
the threshold for efficient triplet-triplet annihilation shifts to lower
incident powers with increasing MAFA thickness, which suggests that the charge
transfer to the triplet state competes with non-radiative trap filling. Hence,
injection of free electrons and holes into the upconverting organic
semiconductor can provide a new avenue for sensitization of rubrene, and may
allow us to move away from the necessity of efficient excitonic
singlet-to-triplet converters.

Vignette's compression technique uses a neural network to predict saliency

perceptual information into the video storage system to support a perceptual
compression feedback loop. Vignette's saliency-based optimizations reduce

vision. Existing methods towards this problem mainly include handcrafted priors
based methods that rely on the use of the atmospheric degradation model and
learning based approaches that require paired fog-fogfree training example
images. In practice, however, prior-based methods are prone to failure due to
their own limitations and paired training data are extremely difficult to
acquire. Inspired by the principle of CycleGAN network, we have developed an
end-to-end learning system that uses unpaired fog and fogfree training images,
adversarial discriminators and cycle consistency losses to automatically
construct a fog removal system. Similar to CycleGAN, our system has two
transformation paths; one maps fog images to a fogfree image domain and the
other maps fogfree images to a fog image domain. Instead of one stage mapping,
our system uses a two stage mapping strategy in each transformation path to
enhance the effectiveness of fog removal. Furthermore, we make explicit use of
prior knowledge in the networks by embedding the atmospheric degradation
principle and a sky prior for mapping fogfree images to the fog images domain.
In addition, we also contribute the first real world nature fog-fogfree image
dataset for defogging research. Our multiple real fog images dataset (MRFID)
contains images of 200 natural outdoor scenes. For each scene, there are one
clear image and corresponding four foggy images of different fog densities
manually selected from a sequence of images taken by a fixed camera over the

state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real world images demonstrate
that our approach is effective and performs favorably for recovering a clear

longer-lived than spicules, and visible mostly in transition-region spectral
lines. They show a broad variation in properties, which pose substantial
difficulties for their identification, modelling, and the understanding of
their role in the mass and energy balance of the solar atmosphere. In this
study, we focused on a sub-population of these jets that undergo parabolic
trajectories when observed in the He II 304 {\AA} line using high-cadence
observations of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to accumulate a statistically significant sample,
which included 330 such events. We found these jets to be typically narrow (3-6
Mm), collimated flows of plasma, which reach heights of about 25 Mm, thus being
among the smallest jets observed in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Combined
with the rise velocities of 70-140 km/s and lifetimes of around 15 min, this
makes them plausible candidates for the EUV counterpart of type II spicules.
Moreover, we have found their dynamics to be inconsistent with a purely
ballistic motion; instead, there is a strong correlation between the initial
velocities and decelerations of the jets, which indicates that they may be
driven by magneto-acoustic shocks with a dominant period of 10${\pm}$2 min.
This makes these EUV jets similar in their dynamics to the conventional, or
type I spicules, thus justifying the name of macro-spicules in this case, while
a substantial difference in the shock periods (1-2 min for the chromospheric
jets) suggests a dissimilarity in the formation conditions.

re-examine the roles of latent variables in stochastic recurrent models for
speech density estimation. Our analysis reveals that under the restriction of
fully factorized output distribution in previous evaluations, the stochastic
models were implicitly leveraging intra-step correlation but the standard
recurrent baselines were prohibited to do so, resulting in an unfair
comparison. To correct the unfairness, we remove such restriction in our
re-examination, where all the models can explicitly leverage intra-step
correlation with an auto-regressive structure. Over a diverse set of sequential
data, including human speech, MIDI music, handwriting trajectory and
frame-permuted speech, our results show that stochastic recurrent models fail
to exhibit any practical advantage despite the claimed theoretical superiority.
In contrast, standard recurrent models equipped with an auto-regressive output
distribution consistently perform better, significantly advancing the
state-of-the-art results on three speech datasets.

of the brain's white matter structures through tractography. Analyzing dMRI
measures along the trajectory of white matter bundles can provide a more
specific investigation than considering a region of interest or tract-averaged
measurements. However, performing group analyses with this along-tract strategy
requires correspondence between points of tract pathways across subjects. This
is usually achieved by creating a new common space where the representative
streamlines from every subject are resampled to the same number of points. If
the underlying anatomy of some subjects was altered due to, e.g. disease or
developmental changes, such information might be lost by resampling to a fixed
number of points. In this work, we propose to address the issue of possible
misalignment, which might be present even after resampling, by realigning the
representative streamline of each subject in this 1D space with a new method,
coined diffusion profile realignment (DPR). Experiments on synthetic datasets
show that DPR reduces the coefficient of variation for the mean diffusivity,
fractional anisotropy and apparent fiber density when compared to the unaligned
case. Using 100 in vivo datasets from the HCP, we simulated changes in mean
diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and apparent fiber density. Pairwise
Student's t-tests between these altered subjects and the original subjects
indicate that regional changes are identified after realignment with the DPR
algorithm, while preserving differences previously detected in the unaligned
case. This new correction strategy contributes to revealing effects of interest
which might be hidden by misalignment and has the potential to improve the
specificity in longitudinal population studies beyond the traditional region of
interest based analysis and along-tract analysis workflows.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation codes and finds many applications in
astrophysics. The classic linear theory considers a discontinuity in density
and velocity at the interface of two fluids. However, for numerical simulations
of the KHI such initial conditions do not yield converged results even at the
linear stage of the instability. Instead, smooth profiles of velocity and
density are required for convergence. This renders analytical theory to be only
approximately valid and hinders quantitative comparisons between the classical
theory and simulations. In this paper we derive a linear theory for the KHI
with smooth profiles and illustrate code testing with the MHD code Athena. We
provide the linear solution for the KHI with smooth initial conditions in three
different limits: inviscid hydrodynamics, ideal MHD and Braginskii-MHD. These
linear solutions are obtained numerically with the framework Psecas
(Pseudo-Spectral Eigenvalue Calculator with an Automated Solver), which
generates and solves numerical eigenvalue problems using an equation-parser and
pseudo-spectral methods. The Athena simulations are carried out on a periodic,
Cartesian domain which is useful for code testing purposes. Using Psecas and
analytic theory, we outline the differences between this artificial numerical
setup and the KHI on an infinite Cartesian domain and the KHI in cylindrical
geometry. We discuss several astrophysical applications, such as cold flows in
galaxy formation and cold fronts in galaxy cluster mergers. Psecas, and the
linear solutions used for code testing, are publicly available and can be

impurities and acoustic gauge phonons. Charged impurities still dominate at low
temperature and densities because of the inability of Dirac fermions to screen
long-range Coulomb potentials at charge neutrality; however, the gauge phonons
dominate for most of the experimental regime because although they couple to
current, they do not induce charge and are therefore unscreened by the large
density of states close to magic angle. We show that the resistivity has a
strong monotonically decreasing carrier density dependence at low temperature
due to charged impurity scattering, and weak density dependence at high
temperature due to gauge phonons. Away from charge neutrality, the resistivity
increases with temperature, while it does the opposite close to the Dirac
point. A non-monotonic temperature dependence observed only at low temperature

velocity field, and are not three-dimensional density structures in the ISM. We
test this hypothesis by stacking probes of the density field -- broadband far
infrared (FIR) emission and the integrated HI column density (NHI) -- at the
locations of linear HI intensity structures. We find that the HI intensity
features are real density structures and not velocity caustics. We generalize
the investigation to all small-scale structure in HI channel maps, and analyze
this correlation as a function of velocity channel width, finding no measurable
contribution from velocity caustics to the HI channel map emission. Further, we
find that small-scale HI channel maps structures have elevated FIR/NHI,
implying that this emission originates from a colder, denser phase of the ISM
than the surrounding material. The data are consistent with a multi-phase
diffuse ISM in which small-scale structures in narrow HI channel maps are
preferentially cold neutral medium (CNM) that is anisotropically distributed
and aligned with the local magnetic field. The shallow spatial power spectrum
(SPS) of narrow HI channels is often attributed to velocity caustics. We
conjecture instead that the small-scale structure and narrow linewidths typical
of CNM explain the observed relationship between the SPS and channel width.

from string theory, such as the KKLT proposal, involve the interplay of gaugino
condensation on a D7-brane stack and an uplift by a positive tension object.
These constructions have recently been challenged using arguments that rely on
the trace-reversed and integrated 10d Einstein equation. We give a critical
assessment of such concerns. We first relate an integrated 10d Einstein
equation to the extremization condition for a 10d-derived 4d effective
potential. Then we argue how to obtain the latter from a 10d action which
incorporates gaugino condensation in a (recently proposed) manifestly finite,
perfect-square form. This effective potential is consistent with 4d
supergravity and does not present obstacles for an uplifted minimum. Moreover,
within standard approximations, we understand the uplift explicitly in one of
the popular versions of the integrated 10d equation. Our conclusion is that de
Sitter constructions of the KKLT type cannot be dismissed simply based on the
integrated 10d equations considered so far.

the P1 stars, with an estimated mean difference of Delta Y = 0.05, but the P2
stars exhibit a significant spread in He content and some may reach Delta Y =
0.13. A smaller He spread may be present also for the P1 stars. Additionally,
stars with spectroscopically determined low [Mg/Fe] ratios ([Mg/Fe]<0) are
generally associated with P2. We find the P2 stars to be slightly more
centrally concentrated in NGC 2419 with a projected half-number radius of about
10% less than for the P1 stars, but the difference is not highly significant
(p=0.05). We find evidence of rotation for the P1 stars, whereas the results
are inconclusive for the P2 stars, which are consistent with no rotation as
well as the same average rotation found for the P1 stars. Because of the long
relaxation time scale of NGC 2419, the radial trends and kinematic properties
of the populations are expected to be relatively unaffected by dynamical
evolution. Hence, they provide constraints on formation scenarios for multiple
populations, which must account not only for the presence of He spreads within
sub-populations identified via CNO variations, but also for the relatively
modest differences in the spatial distributions and kinematics of the

show that interpreting trends in relations, such as the radial and vertical
chemical abundance gradients, the age-metallicity relation, and the
metallicity-rotational velocity relation (MVR), can lead to conflicting
conclusions about the Galaxy past if analyses marginalize over stellar age
and/or birth radius. It is demonstrated that the MVR in RAVE giants is
consistent with being always strongly negative, when narrow bins of [Mg/Fe] are
considered. This is directly related to the negative radial metallicity
gradients of stars grouped by common age (mono-age populations) due to the
inside out disk formation. The effect of the asymmetric drift can then give
rise to a positive MVR trend in high-[alpha/Fe] stars, with a slope dependent
on a given survey's selection function and observational uncertainties. We also
study the variation of lithium abundance, A(Li), with [Fe/H] of AMBRE:HARPS
dwarfs. A strong reversal in the positive A(Li)-[Fe/H] trend of the total
sample is found for mono-age populations, flattening for younger groups of
stars. Dissecting by birth radius shows strengthening in the positive

of spatial curvature on the phase space is radical, since it destabilizes all
the stable de Sitter vacua of the flat spacetime vacuum $f(R)$ gravity phase
space, making the phase space having non-trivial unstable submanifolds. This
instability occurs regardless if the spacetime has elliptic or hyperbolic
spatial sections, and it is also robust towards the choice of initial
conditions. We investigate the source of the instability in the system, and
also we discuss the stability of the matter and radiation domination vacua,

defenses for recognizing and isolating attacks on cyber-physical systems. We
consider attackers who perform integrity attacks on a set of sensors and
actuators in a control system. In such cases, a model aware adversary can
carefully design attack vectors to bypass bad data detection and identification
filters while causing damage to the control system. To counter such an
attacker, we propose the moving target defense which introduces stochastic,
time-varying parameters in the control system. The underlying random dynamics
of the system limit an attacker's model knowledge and inhibits his/her ability
to construct stealthy attack sequences. Moreover, the time-varying nature of
the dynamics thwarts adaptive adversaries. We explore three main designs.
First, we consider a hybrid system where parameters within the existing plant
are switched among multiple modes. We demonstrate how such an approach can
enable both the detection and identification of malicious nodes. Next, we
investigate the addition of an extended system with dynamics that are coupled
to the original plant but do not affect system performance. An attack on the
original system will affect the authenticating subsystem and in turn be
revealed by a set of sensors measuring the extended plant. Lastly, we propose
the use of sensor nonlinearities to enhance the effectiveness of the moving
target defense. The nonlinear dynamics act to conceal normal operational
behavior from an attacker who has tampered with the system state, further
hindering an attacker's ability to glean information about the time-varying

``future-included'', we study a harmonic oscillator model defined with a
non-normal Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$, in which a mass $m$ and an angular frequency
$\omega$ are taken to be complex numbers. In order for the model to be sensible
some restrictions on $m$ and $\omega$ are required. We draw a phase diagram in
the plane of the arguments of $m$ and $\omega$, according to which the model is
classified into several types. In addition, we formulate two pairs of
annihilation and creation operators, two series of eigenstates of the
Hamiltonians $\hat{H}$ and $\hat{H}^\dag$, and coherent states. They are
normalized in a modified inner product $I_Q$, with respect to which the
Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ becomes normal. Furthermore, applying to the model the
maximization principle that we previously proposed, we obtain an effective
theory described by a Hamiltonian that is $Q$-Hermitian, i.e. Hermitian with
respect to the modified inner product $I_Q$. The generic solution to the model
is found to be the ``ground'' state. Finally we discuss what the solution
implies.

to the challenging operating conditions, rapid technology development and large
number of aging wind turbines. In particular, predictive maintenance planning
requires the early detection of faults with few false positives. Achieving this
type of detection is a challenging problem due to the complex and weak
signatures of some faults, particularly the faults that occur in some of the
drivetrain bearings. Here, we investigate recently proposed condition
monitoring methods based on unsupervised dictionary learning using vibration
data recorded over 46 months under typical industrial operations. Thus, we
contribute novel test results and real world data that are made publicly
available. The results of former studies addressing condition monitoring tasks
using dictionary learning indicate that unsupervised feature learning is useful
for diagnosis and anomaly detection purposes. However, these studies are based
on small sets of labeled data from test rigs operating under controlled
conditions that focus on classification tasks, which are useful for
quantitative method comparisons but gives little insight into how useful these
approaches are in practice. In this study, dictionaries are learned from
gearbox vibrations in six different turbines, and the dictionaries are
subsequently propagated over a few years of monitoring data when faults are
known to occur. We perform the experiment using two different sparse coding
algorithms to investigate if the algorithm selected affects the features of
abnormal conditions. We calculate the dictionary distance between the initial
and propagated dictionaries and find the time periods of abnormal dictionary
adaptation starting six months before a drivetrain bearing replacement and one
year before the resulting gearbox replacement.

cosmological $N$-body simulations. We adopt a two component model that consists
of the infall component, which corresponds to galaxies that are now falling

galaxies that are on their first (or more) orbit after falling into galaxy
clusters. We find that we can reproduce the distribution of the line-of-sight

red-spiral galaxies reside predominantly in the infall component, regardless of

site of the supernova. We use a Bayesian method to estimate the star formation
history and mass weighted age of a supernova's environment by matching observed
spectral energy distributions to a synthesized stellar population. Applying
this age estimator to both the photometrically and spectroscopically classified
Sloan Digital Sky Survey II supernovae (N=103) we find a $0.114 \pm 0.039~{\rm

8~\text{Gyr}$; it is nearly twice the size of the currently popular mass step.
We then apply a principal component analysis on the SALT2 parameters, host
stellar mass, and local environment age. We find that a new parameter, PC$_1$,
consisting of a linear combination of stretch, host stellar mass, and local
age, shows a very significant ($4.7\sigma$) correlation with Hubble residuals.
There is a much broader range of PC$_1$ values found in the Hubble flow sample
when compared with the Cepheid calibration galaxies. These samples have mildly
statistically different average PC$_1$ values, at $\sim 2.5\sigma$, resulting
in at most a 1.3% reduction in the evaluation of H$_0$. Despite accounting for
the highly significant trend in SNIa Hubble residuals, there remains a 9%
discrepancy between the most recent precision estimates of H$_0$ using SNIa and
the CMB.

catalogues by using Gaussian components to form a model of the emission. This
may not be well suited to complicated jet structures and extended emission,
particularly in the era of interferometers with a high density of short
baselines, that are sensitive to extended emission. In this paper, we
investigate how the optically-motivated source detection package ProFound
(Robotham et al. 2018) may be used to model radio emission of both complicated
and point-like radio sources. We use a combination of observations and
simulations to investigate how ProFound compares to other source extractor
packages used for radio surveys. We find that ProFound can accurately recover
both the flux densities of simulated Gaussian sources as well as extended radio
galaxies. ProFound can create models that trace the complicated nature of these
extended galaxies, which we show is not necessarily the case with other source
extraction software. Our work suggests that our knowledge of the emission from
extended radio objects may be both over or under-estimated using traditional
software. We suggest that ProFound offers a useful alternative to the fitting
of Gaussian components for generating catalogues from current and future radio
surveys. Furthermore, ProFound's multi-wavelength capabilities will be useful
in investigating radio sources in combination with multiwavelength data.

(iid) is standard in many areas of statistics and machine learning.
Nevertheless, in some settings, such as social networks, infectious disease
modeling, and reasoning with spatial and temporal data, this assumption is
false. An extensive literature exists on making causal inferences under the iid
assumption [18, 12, 28, 22], even when unobserved confounding bias may be
present. But, as pointed out in [20], causal inference in non-iid contexts is
challenging due to the presence of both unobserved confounding and data
dependence. In this paper we develop a general theory describing when causal
inferences are possible in such scenarios. We use segregated graphs [21], a
generalization of latent projection mixed graphs [30], to represent causal
models of this type and provide a complete algorithm for non-parametric
identification in these models. We then demonstrate how statistical inference
may be performed on causal parameters identified by this algorithm. In
particular, we consider cases where only a single sample is available for parts
of the model due to full interference, i.e., all units are pathwise dependent
and neighbors' treatments affect each others' outcomes [26]. We apply these
techniques to a synthetic data set which considers users sharing fake news
articles given the structure of their social network, user activity levels, and
baseline demographics and socioeconomic covariates.

conservation for the energy constrained network. Choosing a cluster head can
appropriately balance the load in the network thereby reducing energy

basis of security for RSA public-key cryptography, which specifically relies on
products of two large primes or semi-primes. The best-known factoring
algorithms for classical computers run in sub-exponential time. Since integer
factorization is in NP, one can reduce this problem to any NP-hard problem,
such as Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). While reducing factoring to SAT has
proved to be useful for studying SAT solvers, attempting to factor large
integers via such a reduction has not been found to be successful.
  Shor's quantum factoring algorithm factors any integer in polynomial time,
although large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of implementing
Shor's algorithm are not yet available, so relevant benchmarking experiments
for factoring via Shor's algorithm are not yet possible. In recent years,
however, several authors have attempted factorizations with the help of quantum
processors via reductions to NP-hard problems. While this approach may shed
some light on some algorithmic approaches for quantum solutions to NP-hard
problems, in this paper we study and question the practical effectiveness of
this approach for factoring large numbers. We find no evidence that this is a
viable path toward factoring large numbers, even for scalable fault-tolerant
quantum computers, as well as for various quantum annealing or other special
purpose quantum hardware.

This provides a stable dark matter candidate as well as radiatively generating
a neutrino mass. Within this framework we will then construct an entirely new

neutrino mass hierarchies, (ii) the effect of cosmological redshift on e.g. the
number density of cosmic neutrino background neutrinos, and, (iii) the

Kelly and Machado (2018), where the authors placed new constraints on
neutrinophilic and axion dark matter models. At low mediator masses, we find an
improvement of an order of magnitude on current constraints from kaon decays.
The constraint is complimentary (and slightly weaker) than current constraints
from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background. We explore
how future higher energy events could improve this bound.

temperatures show a reasonable agreement with the temperatures derived from
SEDs within their uncertainties. A new census of the OVI $\lambda$6830

approximating the distribution of the shocks with a Gaussian and tails mixture
sieve. The asymptotic framework provides consistency, rate of convergence and

in a random graph. To find whether an edge $e$ exists, we need to perform an
expensive test, in which case the edge $e$ appears independently with a
\emph{known} probability $p_e$. Given a budget on the total cost of the tests,
our goal is to find a testing strategy that maximizes the expected maximum
matching size.
  The above application is an example of the stochastic probing problem. In
general the optimal stochastic probing strategy is difficult to find because it
is \emph{adaptive}---decides on the next edge to probe based on the outcomes of
the probed edges. An alternate approach is to show the \emph{adaptivity gap} is
small, i.e., the best \emph{non-adaptive} strategy always has a value close to
the best adaptive strategy. This allows us to focus on designing non-adaptive
strategies that are much simpler. Previous works, however, have focused on
Bernoulli random variables that can only capture whether an edge appears or
not. In this work we introduce a multi-value stochastic probing problem, which
can also model situations where the weight of an edge has a probability
distribution over multiple values.
  Our main technical contribution is to obtain (near) optimal bounds for the
(worst-case) adaptivity gaps for multi-value stochastic probing over
prefix-closed constraints. For a monotone submodular function, we show the
adaptivity gap is at most $2$ and provide a matching lower bound. For a
weighted rank function of a $k$-extendible system (a generalization of
intersection of $k$ matroids), we show the adaptivity gap is between $O(k\log
k)$ and $k$. None of these results were known even in the Bernoulli case where
both our upper and lower bounds also apply, thereby resolving an open question
of Gupta et al.

applications in quantum computing possible in the near future. Existing quantum
programming languages and compilers use a quantum assembly language composed of
1- and 2-qubit (quantum bit) gates. Quantum compiler frameworks translate this
quantum assembly to electric signals (called control pulses) that implement the
specified computation on specific physical devices. However, there is a
mismatch between the operations defined by the 1- and 2-qubit logical ISA and
their underlying physical implementation, so the current practice of directly
translating logical instructions into control pulses results in inefficient,
high-latency programs. To address this inefficiency, we propose a universal
quantum compilation methodology that aggregates multiple logical operations
into larger units that manipulate up to 10 qubits at a time. Our methodology
then optimizes these aggregates by (1) finding commutative intermediate
operations that result in more efficient schedules and (2) creating custom
control pulses optimized for the aggregate (instead of individual 1- and
2-qubit operations). Compared to the standard gate-based compilation, the
proposed approach realizes a deeper vertical integration of high-level quantum
software and low-level, physical quantum hardware. We evaluate our approach on
important near-term quantum applications on simulations of superconducting
quantum architectures. Our proposed approach provides a mean speedup of
$5\times$, with a maximum of $10\times$. Because latency directly affects the
feasibility of quantum computation, our results not only improve performance
but also have the potential to enable quantum computation sooner than otherwise

Consequently, in many real-world directed social networks vertices do not play
equal role. Instead, vertices form a hierarchy such that the edges appear
mainly from upper levels to lower levels. Discovering hierarchies from such
graphs is a challenging problem that has gained attention. Formally, given a
directed graph, we want to partition vertices into levels such that ideally
there are only edges from upper levels to lower levels. From computational
point of view, the ideal case is when the underlying directed graph is acyclic.
In such case, we can partition the vertices into a hierarchy such that there
are only edges from upper levels to lower edges. In practice, graphs are rarely
acyclic, hence we need to penalize the edges that violate the hierarchy. One
practical approach is agony, where each violating edge is penalized based on
the severity of the violation. The fastest algorithm for computing agony
requires $O(nm^2)$ time. In the paper we present an algorithm for computing
agony that has better theoretical bound, namely $O(m^2)$. We also show that in
practice the obtained bound is pessimistic and that we can use our algorithm to
compute agony for large datasets. Moreover, our algorithm can be used as
any-time algorithm.

linear registration-derived spatial priors are used to incorporate additional

random elastic deformations is also used to regularize the networks, allowing
for excellent performance even in cases where only limited labelled training

population (mean Dice coefficient = 92.1%) and sub-cortical segmentation in a
healthy adult population (mean Dice coefficient = 89.5%), we demonstrate new
state-of-the-art accuracies and a high robustness to outliers with the same

scan-rescan dataset demonstrates accuracy (mean Dice coefficient = 86.6%)
similar to the scan-rescan reliability of expert manual segmentations (mean
Dice coefficient = 86.9%), and improved reliability compared to both expert
manual segmentations and automated segmentations using FIRST. Furthermore, our
method maintains a highly competitive runtime performance (e.g. requiring only
10 seconds for left/right hippocampal segmentation in 1x1x1 MNI stereotaxic

the presence of homoclinic bifurcations that result in the sudden loss of the
stable oscillations of the cell-substrate adhesion towards weaker adhesion and
high expression levels of the gene encoding Tubulin beta-3 chain, thus

selecting a single community turns out to be a fairly ill-posed problem, as the
optimization criterion has to make a difficult choice between selecting a tight
but small community or a more inclusive but sparser community.
  In order to avoid the problem of selecting only a single community we propose
discovering a sequence of nested communities. More formally, given a graph and
a starting set, our goal is to discover a sequence of communities all
containing the starting set, and each community forming a denser subgraph than
the next. Discovering an optimal sequence of communities is a complex
optimization problem, and hence we divide it into two subproblems: 1) discover
the optimal sequence for a fixed order of graph vertices, a subproblem that we
can solve efficiently, and 2) find a good order. We employ a simple heuristic
for discovering an order and we provide empirical and theoretical evidence that
our order is good.

  with Negative Lipschitz Constants",,,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses Lipschitzian stability issues that play an important
role in both theoretical and numerical aspects of variational analysis,
optimization, and their applications. We particularly concentrate on the
so-called relaxed one-sided Lipschitz property of set-valued mappings with
negative Lipschitz constants. This property has been much less investigated
than more conventional Lipschitzian behavior while being well recognized in a
variety of applications. Recent work has revealed that set-valued mappings
satisfying the relaxed one-sided Lipschitz condition with negative Lipschitz
constant possess a localization property that is stronger than uniform metric
regularity. The present paper complements this fact by providing a
characterization not only of one specific single point of a preimage, but of
entire preimages of such mappings. Developing a geometric approach, we derive
an explicit formula to calculate preimages of relaxed one-sided Lipschitz
mappings between finite-dimensional spaces and obtain a further specification
of this formula via extreme points of image sets.

  Gaussian Copula",,,,,"cs.CR cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a generic mechanism to efficiently release differentially private
synthetic versions of high-dimensional datasets with high utility. The core
technique in our mechanism is the use of copulas. Specifically, we use the
Gaussian copula to define dependencies of attributes in the input dataset,
whose rows are modelled as samples from an unknown multivariate distribution,
and then sample synthetic records through this copula. Despite the inherently
numerical nature of Gaussian correlations we construct a method that is
applicable to both numerical and categorical attributes alike. Our mechanism is
efficient in that it only takes time proportional to the square of the number
of attributes in the dataset. We propose a differentially private way of
constructing the Gaussian copula without compromising computational efficiency.
Through experiments on three real-world datasets, we show that we can obtain
highly accurate answers to the set of all one-way marginal, and two-and
three-way positive conjunction queries, with 99\% of the query answers having
absolute (fractional) error rates between 0.01 to 3\%. Furthermore, for a
majority of two-way and three-way queries, we outperform independent noise
addition through the well-known Laplace mechanism. In terms of computational
time we demonstrate that our mechanism can output synthetic datasets in around
6 minutes 47 seconds on average with an input dataset of about 200 binary
attributes and more than 32,000 rows, and about 2 hours 30 mins to execute a
much larger dataset of about 700 binary attributes and more than 5 million
rows. To further demonstrate scalability, we ran the mechanism on larger
(artificial) datasets with 1,000 and 2,000 binary attributes (and 5 million
rows) obtaining synthetic outputs in approximately 6 and 19 hours,
respectively.

with sub-exponential noise, a strictly more general problem than the standard
OCO. In this setting, the learner receives a subgradient of the loss functions
corrupted by sub-exponential noise and strives to achieve optimal regret
guarantee, without knowledge of the competitor norm, i.e., in a parameter-free
way. Recently, Cutkosky and Boahen (COLT 2017) proved that, given unbounded
subgradients, it is impossible to guarantee a sublinear regret due to an
exponential penalty. This paper shows that it is possible to go around the
lower bound by allowing the observed subgradients to be unbounded via
stochastic noise. However, the presence of unbounded noise in unconstrained OCO
is challenging; existing algorithms do not provide near-optimal regret bounds
or fail to have a guarantee. So, we design a novel parameter-free OCO algorithm
for Banach space, which we call BANCO, via a reduction to betting on noisy
coins. We show that BANCO achieves the optimal regret rate in our problem.
Finally, we show the application of our results to obtain a parameter-free
locally private stochastic subgradient descent algorithm, and the connection to
the law of iterated logarithms.

surrounding hot ring, known as the Cold Spot. Inoue & Silk (2006) proposed that
this feature could be explained by postulating a supervoid: if such a large
underdense region exists, then the growth of matter perturbing around the spot
might differ from the average value in the Universe and the differences might
affect weak lensing analysis of peak statistics. To investigate environmental
effects on halo number count and peak statistics, we used a publicly available
ray-tracing simulation for a box size of 2250$h^{-1}$Mpc on a side (Takahashi
et al. 2017). We found that the number counts for massive haloes toward the
largest underdense region in the simulation decreases and the corresponding
significance of the difference, based on a cosmic average, is $\geq3\sigma$. On
the basis of the results of peak statistics analysis, the number of high peaks
decreases with the decrement of massive haloes, but the number of low peaks
increases with the lack of matter in the line of sight. The highest
significance of the decrement in peak counts in large underdense regions is
$5\sigma$ in the total signal-to-noise ratio. Our result implies that
environmental effects on halo abundance and weak lensing peak statistic can be
used to probe the presence and properties of supervoids.

determination of the hadronic vacuum polarisation (HVP) contribution to better
than 0.5%, a level of precision that demands the inclusion of QCD + QED effects
to properly understand how the behaviour of quarks are modified when their
electric charges are turned on. The QCDSF collaboration has generated an
ensemble of configurations with dynamical QCD and QED fields with the specific
aim of studying flavour breaking effects arising from differences in the quark
masses and charges in physical quantities. Here we study these effects in a
calculation of HVP around the SU(3) symmetric point. Furthermore, by performing
partially-quenched simulations we are able to cover a larger range of quark
masses and charges on these configurations and then fit the results to an SU(3)
flavour breaking expansion. Subsequently, this allows for an extrapolation to
the physical point.

expected, the gas-phase abundances of all three elements exhibit negative

significant positive partial correlations with log $f({\rm H}_2)$ and $\log

decisions in a world that is in flux. Here we examine the characteristics of
ideal and near-ideal observers in a task of this type. We ask when and how
performance depends on task parameters and design, and, in turn, what observer
performance tells us about their decision-making process. In the dynamic clicks
task subjects hear two streams (left and right) of Poisson clicks with
different rates. Subjects are rewarded when they correctly identify the side
with the higher rate, as this side switches unpredictably. We show that a
reduced set of task parameters defines regions in parameter space in which
optimal, but not near-optimal observers, maintain constant response accuracy.
We also show that for a range of task parameters an approximate normative model
must be finely tuned to reach near-optimal performance, illustrating a
potential way to distinguish between normative models and their approximations.
In addition, we show that using the negative log-likelihood and the 0/1-loss
functions to fit these types of models is not equivalent: the 0/1-loss leads to
a bias in parameter recovery that increases with sensory noise. These findings
suggest ways to tease apart models that are hard to distinguish when tuned
exactly, and point to general pitfalls in experimental design, model fitting,
and interpretation of the resulting data.

the merger of supermassive black holes. Contrary to stellar-mass black hole
mergers, such events are expected to be rich X-ray sources due to the accretion
of material from the circumbinary disks onto the black holes. The orbital
dynamics before merger is also expected to modulate the resulting X-ray
emission via Doppler boosting in a quasi-periodic way, and in a simple phase
relation with the gravitational wave from the inspiral of the black holes.
Detecting the X-ray source would enable a precise and early localization of the
binary, thus allowing many telescopes to observe the very moment of the merger.
Although identifying the correct X-ray source in the relatively large LISA sky
localization will be challenging due to the presence of many confounding point
sources, the quasi-periodic modulation may aid in the identification. We
explore the practical feasibility of such idea. We simulate populations of
merging supermassive black holes, their detection with LISA and their X-ray
lightcurves using a simple model. Taking the parameters of the X-ray Telescope
on the proposed NASA Transient Astrophysics Probe, we then design and simulate
an observation campaign that searches for the modulated X-ray source while LISA
is still observing the inspiral of the black holes. Assuming a fiducial LISA
detection rate of $10$ mergers per year at redshift closer than $3.5$, we
expect a few detections of modulated X-ray counterparts over the nominal
duration of the LISA mission.

dilemma since non-vaccinators can benefit from the herd immunity created by the
vaccinators. Thus the optimum vaccination level is not reached via voluntary
vaccination at times. Intensive studies incorporate social networks to study
vaccination behavior, and it is shown that vaccination can be promoted on some
networks. The underlying network, however, is often assumed to be static,
neglecting the dynamical nature of social networks. We investigate the
vaccination behavior on dynamical social networks using both simulations and
mean-field approximations. We find that the more robust the
vaccinator-infected-non-vaccinator links are or the more fragile the
vaccinator-healthy-non-vaccinator links are, the higher the final vaccination
level is. This result is true for arbitrary rationality. Furthermore, we show
that, under strong selection, the vaccination level can be higher than that in
the well-mixed population. In addition, we show that vaccination on evolving
social network is equivalent to the vaccination in well mixed population with a
rescaled basic reproductive ratio. Our results highlight the dynamical nature
of social network on the vaccination behavior, and can be insightful for the
epidemic control.

performing variable selection under the so-called strong hierarchy constraint:
an interaction is non-zero only if its associated main features are non-zero.
Existing convex optimization based algorithms face difficulties in handling
problems where the number of main features $p \sim 10^3$ (with total number of
features $\sim p^2$). In this paper, we study a convex relaxation which
enforces strong hierarchy and develop a highly scalable algorithm based on
proximal gradient descent. We introduce novel screening rules that allow for
solving the complicated proximal problem in parallel. In addition, we introduce
a specialized active-set strategy with gradient screening for avoiding costly
gradient computations. The framework can handle problems having dense design
matrices, with $p = 50,000$ ($\sim 10^9$ interactions)---instances that are

degree that a single machine is not capable of efficiently processing large
graphs. Thereby, efficient graph partitioning is necessary for those large
graph applications. Traditional graph partitioning generally loads the whole
graph data into the memory before performing partitioning; this is not only a
time consuming task but it also creates memory bottlenecks. These issues of
memory limitation and enormous time complexity can be resolved using
stream-based graph partitioning. A streaming graph partitioning algorithm reads
vertices once and assigns that vertex to a partition accordingly. This is also
called an one-pass algorithm. This paper proposes an efficient window-based
streaming graph partitioning algorithm called WStream. The WStream algorithm is
an edge-cut partitioning algorithm, which distributes a vertex among the
partitions. Our results suggest that the WStream algorithm is able to partition
large graph data efficiently while keeping the load balanced across different
partitions, and communication to a minimum. Evaluation results with real
workloads also prove the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, and it
achieves a significant reduction in load imbalance and edge-cut with different

recognition and SLAM systems. Contemporary research has primarily focused on
improving accuracy and precision-recall type metrics, with relatively little
attention paid to a system's absolute storage scaling characteristics, its
flexibility to adapt to available computational resources, and its longevity
with respect to easily incorporating newly learned or hand-crafted image
descriptors. Most significantly, improvement in one of these aspects typically
comes at the cost of others: for example, a snapshot-based system that achieves
sub-linear storage cost typically provides no metric pose estimation, or, a
highly accurate pose estimation technique is often ossified in adapting to
recent advances in appearance-invariant features. In this paper, we present a
novel 6-DOF localization system that for the first time simultaneously achieves
all the three characteristics: significantly sub-linear storage growth,
agnosticism to image descriptors, and customizability to available storage and
computational resources. The key features of our method are developed based on
a novel adaptation of multiple-label learning, together with effective
dimensional reduction and learning techniques that enable simple and efficient
optimization. We evaluate our system on several large benchmarking datasets and
provide detailed comparisons to state-of-the-art systems. The proposed method
demonstrates competitive accuracy with existing pose estimation methods while
achieving better sub-linear storage scaling, significantly reduced absolute
storage requirements, and faster training and deployment speeds.

be understood in terms of the valence of atoms. Ideally, this rationale would
extend to quantum dots, often termed artificial atoms, and quantum computation
could be performed by merely controlling the outer-shell electrons of dot-based

scale, disrupt this analogy between atoms and quantum dots, so that real
devices seldom display such a systematic many-electron arrangement. We
demonstrate here an electrostatically-defined quantum dot that is robust to
disorder, revealing a well defined shell structure. We observe four shells (31
electrons) with multiplicities given by spin and valley degrees of freedom. We
explore various fillings consisting of a single valence electron -- namely 1,
5, 13 and 25 electrons -- as potential qubits, and we identify fillings that
yield a total spin-1 on the dot. An integrated micromagnet allows us to perform
electrically-driven spin resonance (EDSR). Higher shell states are shown to be
more susceptible to the driving field, leading to faster Rabi rotations of the
qubit. We investigate the impact of orbital excitations of the p- and d-shell
electrons on single qubits as a function of the dot deformation. This allows us
to tune the dot excitation spectrum and exploit it for faster qubit control.
Furthermore, hotspots arising from this tunable energy level structure provide
a pathway towards fast spin initialisation. The observation of spin-1 states
may be exploited in the future to study symmetry-protected topological states
in antiferromagnetic spin chains and their application to quantum computing.

embedding sub-algebras coupled cluster (SES-CC) formalism to the unitary CC
formalism. In analogy to the standard single-reference SES-CC formalism, its
unitary CC extension allows one to include the dynamical (outside the active
space) correlation effects in an SES induced complete active space (CAS)
effective Hamiltonian. In contrast to the standard single-reference SES-CC
theory, the unitary CC approach results in a Hermitian form of the effective
Hamiltonian. Additionally, for the double unitary CC formalis (DUCC) the
corresponding CAS eigenvalue problem provides a rigorous separation of external
cluster amplitudes that describe dynamical correlation effects - used to define
the effective Hamiltonian - from those corresponding to the internal (inside
the active space) excitations that define the components of eigenvectors
associated with the energy of the entire system. The proposed formalism can be
viewed as an efficient way of downfolding many-electron Hamiltonian to the
low-energy model represented by a particular choice of CAS. In principle, this
technique can be extended to any type of complete active space representing an
arbitrary energy window of a quantum system. The Hermitian character of
low-dimensional effective Hamiltonians makes them an ideal target for several
types of full configuration interaction (FCI) type eigensolvers. As an example,
we also discuss the algebraic form of the perturbative expansions of the
effective DUCC Hamiltonians corresponding to composite unitary CC theories and
discuss possible algorithms for hybrid classical and quantum computing.

sequential decisions under the agents' interaction, where well-coordinated
actions among the agents are crucial to achieve the target goal better at these
tasks. One way to accelerate the coordination effect is to enable multiple
agents to communicate with each other in a distributed manner and behave as a
group. In this paper, we study a practical scenario when (i) the communication
bandwidth is limited and (ii) the agents share the communication medium so that
only a restricted number of agents are able to simultaneously use the medium,
as in the state-of-the-art wireless networking standards. This calls for a
certain form of communication scheduling. In that regard, we propose a
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework, called SchedNet, in which
agents learn how to schedule themselves, how to encode the messages, and how to
select actions based on received messages. SchedNet is capable of deciding
which agents should be entitled to broadcasting their (encoded) messages, by
learning the importance of each agent's partially observed information. We
evaluate SchedNet against multiple baselines under two different applications,
namely, cooperative communication and navigation, and predator-prey. Our
experiments show a non-negligible performance gap between SchedNet and other
mechanisms such as the ones without communication and with vanilla scheduling
methods, e.g., round robin, ranging from 32% to 43%.

dynamical model, is surveyed by using WKB approximation. The exact form of the
modified Toomre criterion is derived for both types of systems and it is shown
that the new model is, in all situations, more locally stable than Newtonian
model. In addition, it has been proved that the central surface density of the
galaxies plays an important role in the local stability in the sense that LSB
galaxies are more stable than HSBs. Furthermore, the growth rate in the new
model is found to be lower than the Newtonian one. We found that, according to
this model, the local instability is related to the ratio of surface density of
the disc to a critical surface density $\Sigma^{crit}$. We provide
observational evidence to support this result based on star formation rate in
HSBs and LSBs.

Pavlov","Hidden Fermi surface in K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$: LDA+DMFT study","4 pages, 4 figures","JETP Letters 108(9), 623 (2018)","10.1134/S0021364018210038",,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we provide theoretical LDA+DMFT support of recent ARPES
experimental observation of the so called hidden hole like band and
corresponding hidden Fermi surface sheet near $\Gamma$-point in the
K$_{0.62}$Fe$_{1.7}$Se$_2$ compound. To some extent this is a solution to the
long-standing riddle of Fermi surface absence around $\Gamma$-point in the
K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ class of iron chalcogenide superconductors. In accordance
with the experimental data Fermi surface was found near the $\Gamma$-point
within LDA+DMFT calculations. Based on the LDA+DMFT analysis in this paper it
is shown that the largest of the experimental Fermi surface sheets is actually
formed by a hybrid Fe-3d($xy,xz,yz$) quasiparticle band. It is also shown that
the Fermi surface is not a simple circle as DFT-LDA predicts, but has
(according to the LDA+DMFT) a more complicated `propeller'-like structure due
to correlations and multiorbital nature of the K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ materials.
While the smallest experimental Fermi surface around $\Gamma$-point is in some
sense fictitious, since it is formed by the summation of the intensities of the
spectral function associated with `propeller' loupes and is not connected to
any of quasiparticle bands.

gravitational-wave signals from four magnetar bursts in Advanced LIGO's second
observing run. We find no evidence of a signal and set upper bounds on the root
sum squared of the total dimensionless strain ($h_{\text{rss}}$) from incoming
intermediate-duration gravitational waves ranging from $1.1 \times 10^{-22}$ at
150 Hz to $4.4 \times 10^{-22}$ at 1550 Hz at 50% detection efficiency. From
the known distance to the magnetar SGR 1806-20 (8.7 kpc) we can place upper

design several strategies for reducing the false positive rate. The design
leverages the context information from the deeper layers in order to increase
recall rate while maintaining a low false positive rate. In addition, we reduce
the detection time by an improved inference procedure for decoding outputs
faster. The inference time of a VGA ($640{\times}480$) image was only
approximately 26 ms with a Titan X GPU. The effectiveness of our proposed

DREAMR is a difficult problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty

hybrid planning framework to solve the DREAMR problem that exploits its
structural decomposability. Our framework consists of a global open-loop
planning layer that invokes and monitors a local closed-loop execution layer.
Additional abstractions allow efficient and seamless interleaving of planning
and execution. We create a large-scale simulation for DREAMR problems, with
each scenario having hundreds of transportation routes and thousands of
connection points. Our algorithmic framework significantly outperforms a
receding horizon control baseline, in terms of elapsed time to reach the
destination and energy expended by the agent.

describe the resulting luminosity dependence of the best-fit HOD parameters. To
minimise systematic halo modelling effects, we use theoretical halo 2-point

constrain the satellite galaxy red fraction in a model-independent manner which

accuracy values of 91.07%, 96.12%, and 94.34%, respectively, with an area under

using optical trapping of a set of microscopic particles at the interface,
particularly when the vertical thickness of the droplet reduces to less than 50
$\mu$m. We find that at the later stages of the droplet evaporation,
particularly when the convection currents become large, the top air-water
interface starts to spontaneously oscillate vertically as a function of time in
consistency with predictions. We also detect travelling wave trains moving in
the azimuthal direction of the drop surface which are consistent with
hydrothermal waves at a different combination of Reynolds, Prandtl and
Evaporation than previously observed. This is the first time that wave-trains
have been observed in water, being extremely challenging to detect both
interferometrically and with infra-red cameras. We also find that such waves
apply a force parallel to the interface along the propagation direction.

inclined to be served over mmW band. The allocation problem over mmW band can
be solved by a greedy algorithm. Over $\mu$W band, we propose an

estimated to initialize the allocation. Then, we keep altering RB's ownership

space plasmas, such as solar flares and geomagnetic substorms, but there has
been much confusion regarding reconnection onset responsible for the explosive
events. The main theme of the present paper is to propose a new physical
concept on reconnection onset and to clarify physical mechanism responsible for
flares and substorms. Reconnection rate can be defined as inductive electric
field along X neutral line, so it is proposed that large-scale reconnection can
occur when ambient reconnection (inductive) electric fields effectively
penetrate into X line. In the solar corona or geomagnetic tail without
effective Coulomb collision, reconnection electric fields are shielded (cut
off) around X line, so reconnection cannot occur and magnetic energy can be
stored in the form of current sheets. It is demonstrated that when plasmas
become effectively collisional and dissipative around X line, shielding of
reconnection electric fields around X line is violated, and reconnection
drastically grows to eventually cause the (Petschek-like) fast reconnection
mechanism responsible for flares and substorms.

and reanalyse the available parity-violating electron scattering data, up to
$Q^2$ $\sim$ 1 GeV$^2$. Our analysis considers systematic expansions of the

provide an update to the determination of strangeness over a range of $Q^2$

emergence of non-zero strangeness is revealed in the vicinity of $Q^2$ $\sim$

filtering to increase spectral purity always means lowering the rate at which

multi-photon noise. In this paper, we present a scheme, called extended
heralding, which aims to mitigate the reduction of single-photon generation
rate under spectral filtering by removing cases where we detect light in the

allows for higher single-photon generation rates with lower multi-photon noise

perform a modified Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), where only
adjacent clusters (according to the ordering of positions within a chromosome)
are allowed to be merged. A major practical drawback of this method is its
quadratic time and space complexity in the number of loci, which is typically
of the order of 10^4 to 10^5 for each chromosome. Results: By assuming that the
similarity between physically distant objects is negligible, we propose an
implementation of this adjacency-constrained HAC with quasi-linear complexity.

assumption, and show that this method highlights biologically meaningful
signals. Thanks to its small time and memory footprint, the method can be run

thus gives the stochastic framework of particle tracking for heavy-tailed

solution to such SDE itself is a stable process and can be derived easily by
least square parameter fitting from the observed flow concentration data.
However, in a more generalized scenario, a closed form for the solution to a
stable SDE may not exist. We propose a numerical method for solving/generating
a stable SDE in a general set-up. The method incorporates a discretized finite
volume scheme with the characteristic line to solve the fADE or the forward
equation for the Markov process that solves the stable SDE. Then we use a
numerical scheme to generate the solution to the governing SDE using the fADE
solution. Also, often the functional form of the advection or dispersion
coefficients are not known for a given plume concentration data to start with.

dimensional space. A classical approach is to project data on a low dimensional
space and classify by minimizing an appropriate quadratic cost. A strict
control on sparsity is moreover obtained by adding an $\ell_1$ constraint, here
on the matrix of weights used for projecting the data. Tuning the sparsity
bound results in selecting the relevant features for supervised classification.
It is well known that using a quadratic cost is not robust to outliers. We cope
with this problem by using an $\ell_1$ norm both for the constraint and for the
loss function. In this case, the criterion is convex but not gradient Lipschitz
anymore. Another second issue is that we optimize simultaneously the projection
matrix and the centers used for classification. In this paper, we provide a
novel tailored constrained primal-dual method to compute jointly selected
features and classifiers. Extending our primal-dual method to other criteria is
easy provided that efficient projection (on the dual ball for the loss data
term) and prox (for the regularization term) algorithms are available. We
illustrate such an extension in the case of a Frobenius norm for the loss term.
We provide a convergence proof of our primal-dual method, and demonstrate its
effectiveness on three datasets (one synthetic, two from biological data) on
which we compare $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ costs.

address both those issues by means of a novel computational technique, i.e.
computational stigmergy. By using computational stigmergy each sample position
is associated with a digital pheromone deposit, which aggregates with other
deposits according to their spatiotemporal proximity. By processing
transactions data with computational stigmergy, it is possible to identify
high-density areas (hotspots) occurring in different time and days, as well as,
analyze their consistency over time. Indeed, a hotspot can be permanent, i.e.
present throughout the period of observation, or intermittent, i.e. present
only in certain time and days due to community level occurrences (e.g.
nightlife). Such difference is not only spatial (where the hotspot occurs) and
temporal (when the hotspot occurs) but affects also which people visit the
hotspot. The proposed approach is tested on a real-world dataset containing the
credit card transaction of 60k users between 2014 and 2015.

broad spectral range with a number of discrete, equally spaced and highly
coherent frequency components, fully controlled through only two parameters:
the frequency separation between adjacent modes and the carrier offset
frequency. Providing a phase-coherent link between the optical and the
microwave/radio-frequency regions [2], FCs have become groundbreaking tools for
precision measurements[3,4].
  Despite these inherent advantages, developing miniaturized comb sources
across the whole infrared (IR), with an independent and simultaneous control of
the two comb degrees of freedom at a metrological level, has not been possible,
so far. Recently, promising results have been obtained with compact sources,
namely diode-laser-pumped microresonators [5,6] and quantum cascade lasers
(QCL-combs) [7,8]. While both these sources rely on four-wave mixing (FWM) to
generate comb frequency patterns, QCL-combs benefit from a mm-scale
miniaturized footprint, combined with an ad-hoc tailoring of the spectral
emission in the 3-250 {\mu}m range, by quantum engineering [9].
  Here, we demonstrate full stabilization and control of the two key parameters
of a QCL-comb against the primary frequency standard. Our technique, here
applied to a far-IR emitter and open ended to other spectral windows, enables
Hz-level narrowing of the individual comb modes, and metrological-grade tuning
of their individual frequencies, which are simultaneously measured with an
accuracy of 2x10^-12, limited by the frequency reference used. These
fully-controlled, frequency-scalable, ultra-compact comb emitters promise to
pervade an increasing number of mid- and far-IR applications, including quantum
technologies, due to the quantum nature of the gain media [10].

helping differentiate between MHD waves propagating parallel or anti-parallel
to the main magnetic field. While for pure Alfv\'en waves in a homogeneous
plasma the method is strictly valid, we show that compressible, magnetoacoustic
waves are in general described by both Els\""{a}sser variables. Furthermore, in
a compressible and inhomogeneous plasma, the pure MHD waves (Alfv\'en, fast and
slow) are no longer normal modes, but waves become linearly coupled or display
mixed properties of Alfv\'en and magnetoacoustic nature. These waves are
necessarily described by both Els\""{a}sser variables and therefore the
Els\""{a}sser formalism cannot be used to strictly separate parallel and
anti-parallel propagating waves. Nevertheless, even in an inhomogeneous plasma,
for a highly Alfv\'enic wave the Els\""{a}sser variable corresponding to the
propagation direction appears still dominating. We suggest that for Alfv\'enic
waves, the relative amplitude of Els\""{a}sser variables depends on the local
degree of inhomogeneity and other plasma and wave properties. This finding has
implications for turbulence studies in inhomogeneous and compressible plasmas,
such as the solar corona and solar wind.

the EasyLabel tool for easily acquiring high quality ground truth annotation of

change to extract precise object masks at each step. We use this tool to
generate the Object Cluttered Indoor Dataset (OCID) that captures diverse
settings of objects, background, context, sensor to scene distance, viewpoint
angle and lighting conditions. OCID is used to perform a systematic comparison
of existing object segmentation methods. The baseline comparison supports the
need for pixel- and object-wise annotation to progress robot vision towards
realistic applications. This insight reveals the usefulness of EasyLabel and
OCID to better understand the challenges that robots face in the real-world.

gaps in the rings where the surface density abruptly drops to zero. This is
despite of the fact that the range over which a moon transfers angular momentum
onto the ring material is much larger. Recent UVIS-scans of the edges of the
Encke and Keeler gap show that this drop occurs over a range approximately
equal to the rings' thickness. Borderies et al. (1982, 1989) show that this
striking feature is likely related to the local reversal of the usually outward
directed viscous transport of angular momentum in strongly perturbed regions.
In this article we revise the Borderies et al. (1989) model using a granular
flow model to define the shear and bulk viscosities and incorporate the angular
momentum flux reversal effect into the axisymmetric diffusion model we
developed for gaps in dense planetary rings (Gr\""atz et al. 2018). Finally, we
apply our model to the Encke and Keeler division in order to estimate the shear
and bulk viscosities in the vicinity of both gaps.

Belt source of asteroids that belongs to the spectroscopic X-complex and has

We argue that the most probable source is one or more collisional asteroid
families that escaped discovery up to now. We apply a novel method to search
for asteroid families in the inner Main Belt population of asteroids belonging
to the X-complex with moderate albedo. Instead of searching for asteroid
clusters in orbital elements space, which could be severely dispersed when
older than some billions of years, our method looks for correlations between
the orbital semimajor axis and the inverse size of asteroids. This correlation
is the signature of members of collisional families, which drifted from a
common centre under the effect of the Yarkovsky thermal effect. We identify two
previously unknown families in the inner Main Belt among the moderate-albedo
X-complex asteroids. One of them, whose lowest numbered asteroid is (161)
Author, is ~3 Gyrs-old, whereas the second one, whose lowest numbered object is
(689) Zita, can be as old as the Solar System. Members of this latter family
have orbital eccentricities and inclinations that spread them over the entire
inner Main Belt, which is an indication that this family could be primordial,
i.e. it formed before the giant planet orbital instability. The vast majority
of moderate-albedo X-complex asteroids of the inner-Main Belt are genetically
related, as they can be included into few asteroid families. Only nine
X-complex asteroids with moderate albedo of the inner Main Belt cannot be
included in asteroid families. We suggest that these bodies formed by direct
accretion of the solids in the protoplanetary disk, and are thus surviving
planetesimals.

science they arise in symmetric (generalized) eigenvalue problems, in nonlinear
eigenvalue problems, and in electronic structures computations, to name a few
problems. In statistics and machine learning, they arise, for example, in
various dimensionality reduction techniques such as canonical correlation
analysis. In deep learning, regularization and improved stability can be
obtained by constraining some layers to have parameter matrices that belong to
the Stiefel manifold. Solving problems on the generalized Stiefel manifold can
be approached via the tools of Riemannian optimization. However, using the
standard geometric components for the generalized Stiefel manifold has two
possible shortcomings: computing some of the geometric components can be too
expensive and convergence can be rather slow in certain cases. Both
shortcomings can be addressed using a technique called Riemannian
preconditioning, which amounts to using geometric components derived by a
precoditioner that defines a Riemannian metric on the constraint manifold. In
this paper we develop the geometric components required to perform Riemannian
optimization on the generalized Stiefel manifold equipped with a non-standard
metric, and illustrate theoretically and numerically the use of those
components and the effect of Riemannian preconditioning for solving
optimization problems on the generalized Stiefel manifold.

infinite scattering length and supporting no two-body bound states. To lowest
order in effective field theory, these conditions lead to non-interacting

identically in this limit. Since any realistic pairwise interaction is not a
mere delta function, the non-interacting picture is an idealisation indicating
that the effect of interactions is weaker than in the case of off-resonant

when treated using the lowest-order contact interaction, where the scattering
amplitude exhibits an unphysical Landau pole. The avoidance of this state in
the three-boson problem proceeds in a way that parallels the two-dimensional
case. These results pave the way for the experimental realisation of
one-dimensional Bose gases with pure three-body interactions using ultracold

  Projections for Smooth Convex Minimization over Trace-Norm Balls and Related
  Problems","Accepted to SIAM Journal on Optimization (SIOPT)",,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Smooth convex minimization over the unit trace-norm ball is an important
optimization problem in machine learning, signal processing, statistics and
other fields, that underlies many tasks in which one wishes to recover a
low-rank matrix given certain measurements. While first-order methods for
convex optimization enjoy optimal convergence rates, they require in worst-case
to compute a full-rank SVD on each iteration, in order to compute the
projection onto the trace-norm ball. These full-rank SVD computations however
prohibit the application of such methods to large problems. A simple and
natural heuristic to reduce the computational cost is to approximate the
projection using only a low-rank SVD. This raises the question if, and under
what conditions, this simple heuristic can indeed result in provable
convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper we show that any optimal
solution is a center of a Euclid. ball inside-which the projected-gradient
mapping admits rank that is at most the multiplicity of the largest singular
value of the gradient vector. Moreover, the radius of the ball scales with the
spectral gap of this gradient vector. We show how this readily implies the
local convergence (i.e., from a ""warm-start"" initialization) of standard
first-order methods, using only low-rank SVD computations. We also quantify the
effect of ""over-parameterization"", i.e., using SVD computations with higher
rank, on the radius of this ball, showing it can increase dramatically with
moderately larger rank. We extend our results also to the setting of
optimization with trace-norm regularization and optimization over bounded-trace
positive semidefinite matrices. Our theoretical investigation is supported by
concrete empirical evidence that demonstrates the \textit{correct} convergence
of first-order methods with low-rank projections on real-world datasets.

properties of Fe-Cr alloys, we explore the temperature dependence of
magnetisation, susceptibility, Curie temperature and spin-spin correlations

correlated with the microstructure of Fe-Cr, where magnetisation and
susceptibility are determined by the size of Cr precipitates at nominal Cr
concentrations. The Curie temperature is always maximised when the solute
concentration of Cr in the $\alpha$ phase is close to 5 to 6 at.\%, and the
susceptibility of Fe atoms is always enhanced at the boundary between a
precipitate and solid solution. Interaction between Cr and Fe stimulates
magnetic disorder, lowering the effective Curie temperature. Dynamic simulation
of evolution of magnetic correlations shows that the spin-spin relaxation time
in Fe-Cr alloys is in the 20 to 40 ps range.

risk-sensitive based formulation to allocate resources to the incoming URLLC
traffic while minimizing the risk of the eMBB transmission (i.e., protecting
the eMBB users with low data rate) and ensuring URLLC reliability.
Specifically, the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is introduced as a risk
measure for eMBB transmission. Moreover, the reliability constraint of URLLC is
formulated as a chance constraint and relaxed based on Markov's inequality. We
decompose the formulated problem into two subproblems in order to transform it
into a convex form and then alternatively solve them until convergence.
Simulation results show that the proposed approach allocates resources to the
incoming URLLC traffic efficiently while satisfying the reliability of both
eMBB and URLLC.

Fe I 6173 {\AA} spectropolarimetric observations of a decaying active region
obtained from the SST. These data were inverted to retrieve the photospheric
magnetic field underlying the plage as identified in the EUV emission maps
obtained from the SDO/AIA. To obtain better insight into the evolution of
plages, we performed 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
magnetoconvection using the MURaM code. The observations show transient
magnetic flux emergence and cancellation events within the plage on timescales
of a few 100 s and on spatial scales comparable to granules. These transient
events occur at the footpoints of active region plage loops. In one case the
coronal response at the footpoints of these loops is clearly associated with
the underlying transient. The simulations also reveal similar magnetic flux
emergence and cancellation events that extend to even smaller spatial and
temporal scales. Individual simulated transient events transfer an energy flux
in excess of 1 MW m$^{-2}$ through the photosphere. We suggest that the
magnetic transients could play an important role in the energetics of active
region plage. Both in observations and simulations, the opposite-polarity
magnetic field brought up by transient flux emergence cancels with the
surrounding plage field. Magnetic reconnection associated with such transient
events likely conduits magnetic energy to power the overlying chromosphere and
coronal loops.

higher than those selected from radio catalogues). Remarkably, 80% of the
sample shows signs of restarting radio activity. The X-ray properties are
consistent with this scenario, the sources being in a high-accretion,
high-luminosity state with respect to the previous activity responsible for the
radio lobes.

mortality, morbidity, and health costs. Its management is highly time-sensitive
since each hour of delayed treatment increases mortality due to irreversible
organ damage. Meanwhile, despite decades of clinical research, robust
biomarkers for sepsis are missing. Therefore, detecting sepsis early by
utilizing the affluence of high-resolution intensive care records has become a
challenging machine learning problem. Recent advances in deep learning and data
mining promise to deliver a powerful set of tools to efficiently address this
task. This empirical study proposes two novel approaches for the early
detection of sepsis: a deep learning model and a lazy learner based on time
series distances. Our deep learning model employs a temporal convolutional
network that is embedded in a Multi-task Gaussian Process Adapter framework,
making it directly applicable to irregularly-spaced time series data. Our lazy
learner, by contrast, is an ensemble approach that employs dynamic time
warping. We frame the timely detection of sepsis as a supervised time series
classification task. For this, we derive the most recent sepsis definition in
an hourly resolution to provide the first fully accessible early sepsis
detection environment. Seven hours before sepsis onset, our methods improve
area under the precision--recall curve from 0.25 to 0.35/0.40 over the state of
the art. This demonstrates that they are well-suited for detecting sepsis in
the crucial earlier stages when management is most effective.

observed in high resolution spectroscopic surveys can be explained by the
interplay of mixed populations, coming from the inner regions of the Milky Way
disc. The lower lithium content of these stars is a consequence of inside-out
disc formation, plus radial migration. In this framework, local stars with
super-solar metallicities would have migrated to the solar vicinity and
depleted their original lithium during their travel time. To arrive to such a
result, we took advantage of the AMBRE catalog of lithium abundances combined
with chemical evolution models which take into account the contribution to the
lithium enrichment by different nucleosynthetic sources. A large proportion of
migrated stars can explain the observed lower lithium abundance at super-solar
metallicities. We stress that nowadays, there is no stellar model able to
predict Li-depletion for such super-solar metallicity stars, and the Solar
Li-depletion has to be assumed. In addition, it currently exists no solid
quantitative estimate of the proportion of migrated stars in the Solar
neighborhood and their travel time. Our results illustrate how important it is
to properly include radial migration when comparing chemical evolution models
to observations, and that in this case, the lithium decrease at larger
metallicities does not necessarily imply that stellar yields have to be
modified, contrary to previous claims in literature.

during its advanced evolutionary stage as a giant and envelops its companion,
ejecting the hydrogen envelope and tightening its orbit. Such a common envelope
phase is required to tighten the binary orbit in the formation of many of the
observed X-ray binaries and merging compact binary systems. In the formation
scenario for neutron star binaries, the system might pass through a phase where
a neutron star spirals into the envelope of its giant star companion. These
phases lead to mass accretion onto the neutron star. Accretion onto these
common-envelope-phase neutron stars can eject matter that has undergone burning
near to the neutron star surface. This paper presents nucleosynthetic yields of
this ejected matter, using population synthesis models to study the importance
of these nucleosynthetic yields in a galactic chemical evolution context.
Depending on the extreme conditions in temperature and density found in the
accreted material, both proton-rich and neutron-rich nucleosynthesis can be
obtained, with efficient production of neutron rich isotopes of low Z material
at the most extreme conditions, and proton rich isotopes, again at low Z, in
lower density models. Final yields are found to be extremely sensitive to the
physical modeling of the accretion phase. We show that neutron stars accreting
in binary common envelopes might be a new relevant site for galactic chemical
evolution, and therefore more comprehensive studies are needed to better
constrain nucleosynthesis in these objects.

All these extensions increase the expressive power to the class of predicates

that an agent atomically receives messages from all other agents in a

centralized network view provided by the controller to remotely orchestrate the
network switches. To avoid the controller being a single point of failure,
traditional fault-tolerance techniques are employed to guarantee availability,
a fundamental requirement in production environments. Unfortunately, these
techniques fall short of ensuring correct network behaviour under controller
failures. The problem of these techniques is that they deal with only part of
the problem: guaranteeing that application and controller state remains
consistent between replicas. However, in an SDN the switches maintain hard
state that must also be handled consistently. Fault-tolerant SDN must therefore
include switch state into the problem. A recently proposed fault-tolerant
controller platform, Ravana, solves this problem by extending fault-tolerant
SDN control with mechanisms that guarantee control messages to be processed
transactionally and exactly once, at both the controllers and the switches.
These guarantees are given even in the face of controller and switch crashes.
The elegance of this solution comes at a cost. Ravana requires switches to be
modified and OpenFlow to be extended with hitherto unforeseen additions to the
protocol. In face of this challenge we propose Rama, a fault-tolerant SDN
controller platform that offers the same strong guarantees as Ravana without
requiring modifications to switches or to the OpenFlow protocol. Experiments
with our prototype implementation show the additional overhead to be modest,
making Rama the first fault-tolerant SDN solution that can be immediately
deployable.

finance, such as an equity price or foreign exchange rate. This can be related
to the conventional Ito calculus-based framework through the time integral of a
price's squared volatility, or `cumulative variance'. In the new framework,
corresponding processes are strictly increasing, solve random ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), and are composed with geometric Brownian motion.
The new framework has no dependence on stochastic calculus, so processes can be
studied on a pathwise basis using probability-free ODE techniques and
functional analysis.
  The ODEs considered depend on continuous driving functions which are
`spatially irregular', meaning they need not have any spatial regularity
properties such as Holder continuity. They are however strictly increasing in
time, thus temporally asymmetric. When sensible initial values are chosen,
initial value problem (IVP) solutions are also strictly increasing, and the
solution set of such IVPs is shown to contain all differentiable bijections on
the non-negative reals. This enables the modelling of any non-negative
volatility path which is not zero over intervals, via the time derivative of
solutions. Despite this generality, new well-posedness results establish the
uniqueness of solutions going forwards in time.
  Motivation to explore this framework comes from its connection with a
time-changed Heston volatility model. The framework shows how Heston price
processes can converge to a generalisation of the NIG Levy process, and reveals
a deeper relationship between integrated CIR processes and the IG process.
Within this framework, a `Riemann-Liouville-Heston' martingale model is defined
which generalises these relationships to fractional counterparts. This model's
implied volatilities are simulated, and exhibit features characteristic of
leading volatility models.

field following the CoRoT and Kepler space missions. The latter is now yielding
the first measurements of latitudinal differential rotation obtained directly
from oscillation frequencies. Differential rotation is a fundamental mechanism
of the stellar dynamo effect. Our goal is to measure the amount of differential
rotation in the solar analogues 16 Cyg A and B, which are the components of a
binary system. These stars are the brightest observed by Kepler and have
therefore been extensively observed, with exquisite precision on their
oscillation frequencies. We modelled the acoustic power spectrum of 16 Cyg A
and B using a model that takes into account the contribution of differential
rotation to the rotational frequency splitting. The estimation was carried out
in a Bayesian setting. We then inverted these results to obtain the rotation
profile of both stars under the assumption of a solar-like functional form. We
observe that the magnitude of latitudinal differential rotation has a strong
chance of being solar-like for both stars, their rotation rates being higher at
the equator than at the pole. The measured latitudinal differential rotation,
defined as the difference of rotation rate between the equator and the pole, is
$320\pm269$ nHz and $440^{+363}_{-383}$ nHz for 16 Cyg A and B, respectively,
confirming that the rotation rates of these stars are almost solar-like. Their
equatorial rotation rates are $535\pm75$ nHz and $565_{-129}^{+150}$ nHz. Our
results are in good agreement with measurements obtained from
spectropolarimetry, spectroscopy, and photometry. We present the first
conclusive measurement of latitudinal differential rotation for solar
analogues. Their rotational profiles are very close to those of the Sun. These
results depend weakly on the uncertainties of the stellar parameters.

kinematics and stellar density maps of the Galactic bulge with unprecedented
accuracy. However, the still missing key ingredient is the distribution of
stellar ages across the bulge. To overcome this limitation, we aim to age-date
the stellar population in several bulge fields with the ultimate goal of
deriving an age map of the Bulge. This paper presents the methodology and the
first results obtained for a field along the Bulge minor axis, at $b=-6^\circ$.
We use a new PSF-fitting photometry of the VISTA Variables in the V\'{i}a
L\'{a}ctea (VVV) survey data to construct deep color-magnitude diagrams of the
bulge stellar population down to $\sim$ 2 mag below the Main Sequence turnoff.
We find the bulk of the bulge stellar population in the observed field along
the minor axis to be at least older than $\sim$ 7.5 Gyr. In particular, when
the metallicity distribution function spectroscopically derived by GIBS is
used, the best fit to the data is obtained with a combination of synthetic
populations with ages in between $\sim$ 7.5 Gyr and 11 Gyr. However, the
fraction of stars younger than $\sim$ 10 Gyr strongly depends upon the number
of Blue Straggler Stars present in the bulge. Simulations show that the
observed color-magnitude diagram of the bulge in the field along the minor axis
is incompatible with the presence of a conspicuous population of
intermediate-age/young (i.e. $\lesssim 5$ Gyr) stars.

Whether the central object is a black hole or not can be probed by observing
the phasing of these waves, which carry information about its mass and spin
multipole moments. We go beyond the phase terms found by Ryan, which were
obtained in the quadrupolar approximation of the point-particle limit, and
derive terms up to the fifth post-Newtonian (PN) order. Since corrections due
to horizon absorption (i.e., if the central object is a black hole) and tidal
heating appear by that order, at 2.5PN and 5PN, respectively, we include them
here. Corrections due to the motion of the central object, which was addressed
only partially by Ryan, are included as well. Additionally, we obtain the
contribution of the higher order radiative multipole moments. For the tidal
interaction, our results have been derived in the approximation of the
Newtonian tidal field. Therefore, in the potential for tidal field only the
contribution due to the mass of the central object has been included as well.
Using these results we argue that it might be possible for LISA to probe if the
central object in an EMRI has a horizon or not. We also discuss how our results
can be used to test the No-hair theorem from the inspiral phase of such
systems.

where events occur at abnormally high rate. In this paper we revisit
Kleinberg's seminal work, where bursts are discovered by using exponential
distribution with a varying rate parameter: the regions where it is more
advantageous to set the rate higher are deemed bursty. The model depends on two
parameters, the initial rate and the change rate. The initial rate, that is,
the rate that is used when there are no burstiness was set to the average rate
over the whole sequence. The change rate is provided by the user.
  We argue that these choices are suboptimal: it leads to worse likelihood, and
may lead to missing some existing bursts. We propose an alternative problem
setting, where the model parameters are selected by optimizing the likelihood
of the model. While this tweak is trivial from the problem definition point of
view, this changes the optimization problem greatly. To solve the problem in
practice, we propose efficient ($1 + \epsilon$) approximation schemes. Finally,
we demonstrate empirically that with this setting we are able to discover
bursts that would have otherwise be undetected.

algorithm via Online Feature Selection (\textit{RoOFS}) that concurrently
addresses all the above challenges. Specifically, the algorithm iteratively
updates the regression coefficients and the uncorrupted set via a robust online
feature substitution method. We also prove that our algorithm has a restricted

in both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrated that the effectiveness
of our new method is superior to that of existing methods in the recovery of
both feature selection and regression coefficients, with very competitive
efficiency.

a well-known intrinsic property of a chiral nanostructure. It is a
long-standing controversial debate, however, whether a chiral object can also
sense the vorticity, or the orbital angular momentum (OAM), of a light field.
Since OAM is a non-local property, it seems rather counter-intuitive that a
point-like chiral object could be able to distinguish the sense of the
wave-front of light carrying OAM. Here, we show that a dipolar chiral
nanostructure is indeed capable of distinguishing the sign of the phase vortex
of the incoming light beam. To this end, we take advantage of the conversion of
the sign of OAM, carried by a linearly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian beam, into
the sign of optical chirality upon tight focusing. Our study provides for a
deeper insight into the discussion of chiral light-matter interactions and the
respective role of OAM.

organized w.r.t table schemas consisting of columns. In turn each column, may
contain instance values that point to other Wikipedia articles or primitive
values (e.g. numbers, strings etc.).
  In this work, we focus on the problem of interlinking Wikipedia tables for
two types of table relations: equivalent and subPartOf. Through such relations,
we can further harness semantically related information by accessing related
tables or facts therein. Determining the relation type of a table pair is not
trivial, as it is dependent on the schemas, the values therein, and the
semantic overlap of the cell values in the corresponding tables.
  We propose TableNet, an approach that constructs a knowledge graph of
interlinked tables with subPartOf and equivalent relations. TableNet consists
of two main steps: (i) for any source table we provide an efficient algorithm
to find all candidate related tables with high coverage, and (ii) a neural
based approach, which takes into account the table schemas, and the
corresponding table data, we determine with high accuracy the table relation
for a table pair.
  We perform an extensive experimental evaluation on the entire Wikipedia with
more than 3.2 million tables. We show that with more than 88\% we retain
relevant candidate tables pairs for alignment. Consequentially, with an
accuracy of 90% we are able to align tables with subPartOf or equivalent
relations. Comparisons with existing competitors show that TableNet has
superior performance in terms of coverage and alignment accuracy.

we present the Radboud PIpeline for the Calibration of high Angular Resolution
Data (rPICARD), which is an open-source VLBI calibration and imaging pipeline
built on top of the CASA framework. The pipeline is capable of reducing data
from different VLBI arrays. It can be run non-interactively after only a few
non-default input parameters are set and delivers high-quality calibrated data.
CPU scalability based on a message-passing interface (MPI) implementation
ensures that large bandwidth data from future arrays can be processed within
reasonable computing times. Phase calibration is done with a Schwab-Cotton
fringe fit algorithm. For the calibration of residual atmospheric effects,
optimal solution intervals are determined based on the signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N) of the data for each scan. Different solution intervals can be set for
different antennas in the same scan to increase the number of detections in the
low S/N regime. These novel techniques allow rPICARD to calibrate data from
different arrays, including high-frequency and low-sensitivity arrays. The
amplitude calibration is based on standard telescope metadata, and a robust
algorithm can solve for atmospheric opacity attenuation in the high-frequency
regime. Standard CASA tasks are used for CLEAN imaging and self-calibration. In
this work we demonstrate the capabilities of rPICARD by calibrating and imaging
7 mm VLBA data of the central radio source in the M87 galaxy. The reconstructed
jet image reveals a complex collimation profile and edge-brightened structure.
A potential counter-jet is detected that has 10 % of the brightness of the
approaching jet. This constrains jet speeds close to the radio core to about
half the speed of light for small inclination angles.

governed by the liquid-phase surface diffusion. Furthermore, the surface
reduction during the coalescence accelerates its kinetics. It is found that for

particular, we present quantitative research on the presence and impact of
these three `Ps' in online Twitter debates in two contexts: (i) the run up to

comparing tweets by half a million `leave' and `remain' supporters. Next,
online propaganda strategies are examined, specifically left- and right-wing
troll accounts. Lastly, we study the impact of misleading claims made by the
political leaders of the leave and remain campaigns. This is then compared to
the impact of the Russia-backed partisan media and propaganda accounts during
the referendum. In particular, just two of the many misleading claims made by
politicians during the referendum were found to be cited in 4.6 times more

this problem has motivated researchers to propose different schemes, such as
cross validation, generalized cross validation, and Bootstrap. The theoretical
properties of such estimates have been extensively studied in the
low-dimensional settings, where the number of predictors $p$ is much smaller
than the number of observations $n$. However, a unifying methodology
accompanied with a rigorous theory is lacking in high-dimensional settings.
This paper studies the problem of risk estimation under the moderately
high-dimensional asymptotic setting $n,p \rightarrow \infty$ and $n/p
\rightarrow \delta>1$ ($\delta$ is a fixed number), and proves the consistency
of three risk estimates that have been successful in numerical studies, i.e.,
leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), approximate leave-one-out (ALO), and
approximate message passing (AMP)-based techniques. A corner stone of our
analysis is a bound that we obtain on the discrepancy of the `residuals'
obtained from AMP and LOOCV. This connection not only enables us to obtain a
more refined information on the estimates of AMP, ALO, and LOOCV, but also
offers an upper bound on the convergence rate of each estimate.

systems. More specifically, we look at limit cycles of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) with Markovian switching, in which the process switches at
random times among different systems of SDEs, when the switching is fast and
the diffusion (white noise) term is small. The system is modeled by $$
dX^{\epsilon,\delta}(t)=f(X^{\epsilon,\delta}(t),
\alpha^\epsilon(t))dt+\sqrt{\delta}\sigma(X^{\epsilon,\delta}(t),
\alpha^\epsilon(t))dW(t) , \ X^\epsilon(0)=x, $$ where $\alpha^\epsilon(t)$ is
a finite state space Markov chain with irreducible generator $Q=(q_{ij})$. The
relative changing rates of the switching and the diffusion are highlighted by
the two small parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$. We associate to the system
the averaged ODE \[ d\bar X(t)=\bar f(\bar X(t))dt, \ X(0)=x, \] where $\bar
f(\cdot)=\sum_{i=1}^{m_0}f(\cdot, i)\nu_i$ and $(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_{m_0})$ is the
unique invariant probability measure of the Markov chain with generator $Q$.
Suppose that for each pair $(\epsilon,\delta)$ of parameters, the process has
an invariant probability measure $\mu^{\epsilon,\delta}$, and that the averaged
ODE has a limit cycle in which there is an averaged occupation measure $\mu^0$
for the averaged equation. We are able to prove that if $\bar f$ has finitely
many unstable or hyperbolic fixed points, then $\mu^{\epsilon,\delta}$
converges weakly to $\mu^0$ as $\epsilon\to 0$ and $\delta \to 0$. Our results
generalize to the setting of state-dependent switching \[
\mathbb{P}\{\alpha^\epsilon(t+\Delta)=j~|~\alpha^\epsilon=i,
X^{\epsilon,\delta}(s),\alpha^\epsilon(s), s\leq
t\}=q_{ij}(X^{\epsilon,\delta}(t))\Delta+o(\Delta),~~ i\neq j \] as long as the
generator $Q(\cdot)=(q_{ij}(\cdot))$ is bounded, Lipschitz, and irreducible for
all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$. We conclude our analysis by studying a predator-prey
model.

mechanism of conversion of orbital-to-spin angular momentum of light upon
scattering of a linearly polarized vortex beam by a spherical silicon

of first order ($\ell = \pm 1$) exhibit an $\ell$-dependent spatial
distribution of helicity density in the focal volume. By using a dipolar
scatterer the helicity density can be manipulated locally, while influencing
globally the spin and orbital angular momentum of the beam. Specifically, the
scattered light can be purely circularly polarized with the handedness
depending on the orbital angular momentum of the incident beam. We corroborate
our findings with theoretical calculations and an experimental demonstration.

attention in machine learning. However, developing efficient methods for the
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems with certain performance
guarantee remains a challenge. Proximal coordinate descent (PCD) has been
widely used for solving optimization problems, but the knowledge of PCD methods
in the nonconvex setting is very limited. On the other hand, the asynchronous
proximal coordinate descent (APCD) recently have received much attention in
order to solve large-scale problems. However, the accelerated variants of APCD
algorithms are rarely studied. In this paper, we extend APCD method to the
accelerated algorithm (AAPCD) for nonsmooth and nonconvex problems that
satisfies the sufficient descent property, by comparing between the function
values at proximal update and a linear extrapolated point using a delay-aware
momentum value. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide
stochastic and deterministic accelerated extension of APCD algorithms for
general nonconvex and nonsmooth problems ensuring that for both bounded delays
and unbounded delays every limit point is a critical point. By leveraging
Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property, we will show linear and sublinear convergence
rates for the deterministic AAPCD with bounded delays. Numerical results
demonstrate the practical efficiency of our algorithm in speed.

the law of gravity at the low accelerations typical of galactic outskirts. I
consider the feasibility of this wide binary test using the `line velocity'
method. This involves considering only the velocity components along the
direction within the sky plane orthogonal to the systemic proper motion of each
WB.
  I apply this technique to the WB sample of Hernandez et. al. (2019),
carefully accounting for large-angle effects at one order beyond leading. Based
on Monte Carlo trials, the uncertainty in the one-dimensional velocity
dispersion is $\approx 100$ m/s when using sky-projected relative velocities.
Using line velocities reduces this to $\approx 30$ m/s because these are much
less affected by distance uncertainties.
  My analysis does not support the Hernandez et. al. (2019) claim of a clear
departure from Newtonian dynamics beyond a radius of $\approx 10$ kAU, partly
because I use $2\sigma$ outlier rejection to clean their sample first.
Nonetheless, the uncertainties are small enough that existing WB data are
nearly sufficient to distinguish Newtonian dynamics from Modified Newtonian
Dynamics. I estimate that $\approx 1000$ WB systems will be required for this
purpose if using only line velocities.
  In addition to a larger sample, it will also be important to control for
systematics like undetected companions and moving groups. This could be done
statistically. The contamination can be minimized by considering a narrow
theoretically motivated range of parameters and focusing on how different
theories predict different proportions of WBs in this region.

However, little work has been done in the area of estimating the optimal ITR

methods such as outcome weighted learning; however, we take advantage of the
crossover design by using the difference in responses under each treatment as

improved performance of the proposed method compared to standard methods for a

First we use a reward-penalty model to align the incentives of stakeholders.
Then the predefined rules are implemented using blockchain smart contract on

as a trustless hybrid human-machine crowd-intelligence platform. As edge
servers are near to workers and publisher, network congestion can be

Therefore, searching for a solution towards the minimum DRAM access energy is

hierarchical structure. Typically, this structure or ranking is not known;
instead we only have observed outcomes of the interactions, and the goal is to
infer the hierarchy from these observations. Discovering a hierarchy in the
context of directed networks can be formulated as follows: given a graph,
partition vertices into levels such that, ideally, there are only edges from
upper levels to lower levels. The ideal case can only happen if the graph is
acyclic. Consequently, in practice we have to introduce a penalty function that
penalizes edges violating the hierarchy. A practical variant for such penalty
is agony, where each violating edge is penalized based on the severity of the
violation. Hierarchy minimizing agony can be discovered in $O(m^2)$ time, and
much faster in practice. In this paper we introduce several extensions to
agony. We extend the definition for weighted graphs and allow a cardinality
constraint that limits the number of levels. While, these are conceptually
trivial extensions, current algorithms cannot handle them, nor they can be
easily extended. We solve the problem by showing the connection to the
capacitated circulation problem, and we demonstrate that we can compute the
exact solution fast in practice for large datasets. We also introduce a
provably fast heuristic algorithm that produces rankings with competitive
scores. In addition, we show that we can compute agony in polynomial time for
any convex penalty, and, to complete the picture, we show that minimizing
hierarchy with any concave penalty is an NP-hard problem.
