equilibrium state of an engineered quantum dissipative process. Systems in the
equilibrium states of these processes serve as batteries, storing energy. The
dissipative process that brings the battery to the active equilibrium state is
driven by an agent that couples the battery to thermal systems. The second law
of thermodynamics imposes a work cost for the process; however, no work is
needed to keep the battery in that charged state. We consider simple examples
of these batteries and discuss particular cases in which the extracted work or
the efficiency of the process is maximal.

magnetized plasmas. As they are posed in an up to 3+3 dimensional phase space,
solving this problem is extremely expensive from a computational point of view.
In this paper, we exploit the low-rank structure in the solution of the Vlasov
equation. More specifically, we consider the Vlasov--Maxwell system and propose
a dynamic low-rank integrator. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics of
the system by constraining it to a low-rank manifold. This is accomplished by a
projection onto the tangent space. There, the dynamics is represented by the
low-rank factors, which are determined by solving lower-dimensional partial
differential equations. The proposed scheme performs well in numerical
experiments and succeeds in capturing the main features of the plasma dynamics.
We demonstrate this good behavior for a range of test problems. The coupling of
the Vlasov equation with the Maxwell system, however, introduces additional
challenges. In particular, the divergence of the electric field resulting from
Maxwell's equations is not consistent with the charge density computed from the
Vlasov equation. We propose a correction based on Lagrange multipliers which
enforces Gauss' law up to machine precision.

an explanation for such contradiction. By taking a computational approach, we
develop two methodological novelties into the empirical study of corruption:
(1) generating large within-country variation by means of simulation (instead
of cross-national data pooling), and (2) accounting for interactions between
covariates through a spillover network. The latter (the network), seems
responsible for a significant reduction in the effectiveness of the rule of
law; especially among the least developed countries. We also find that
effectiveness can be boosted by improving complementary policy issues that may
lie beyond the governance agenda. Moreover, our simulations suggest that
improvements to the rule of law are a necessary yet not sufficient condition to
curve corruption.

increases efficiency, the nature of such recipes has a bigger effect. In other
words, while it is true that lack of discipline is detrimental to prescription
outcomes (a common defense of failed recommendations), it is more important
that such prescriptions consider the systemic and adaptive nature of the

into account the country-specific constraints that governments face when trying
to reach specific development goals. Hence, we put forward a new definition of

employed as the baseline to construct an index. To demonstrate the usefulness
and validity of our index, we analyze the cases of Mexico, Korea and Estonia,
three developing countries that, arguably, joined the OECD with the aim of
coherently establishing policies that could enable a catch-up process. We find
that Korea shows significant signs of policy coherence, Estonia seems to be in
the process of achieving it, and Mexico has unequivocally failed. Furthermore,
our results highlight the limitations of assessing coherence in terms of naive
benchmark comparisons using development-indicator data. Altogether, our
framework sheds new light in a promising direction to develop bespoke analytic
tools to meet the 2030 agenda.

localization disordered fiber behave like a large-core multimode optical fiber,
with the advantage, that most modes are highly localized in the transverse

occurs during the convergent migration of planets if their resonance angle at
the moment of arrival at the resonance assumes values in a certain range
(inside a window of capture). The width of such a window depends on the
relative migration and circularization rates that are determined by the disk
parameters. The window is wide if the relative migration rate is slow, and it
becomes narrower as the relative migration rate increases. The window will be
closed if the migration rate is sufficiently high, and the capture will not
take place. We illustrate also how the 9:7 resonance window of capture is

shapes and morphologies, both when comparing different objects, and for the
same object in different energy bands. It is unclear if such a variety is
related to differences in the pulsar wind properties, or to differences in the
conditions of the ambient medium. We present here a set of full
three-dimensional, relativistic and magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of BSPWNe,
with the intention of determining how differences in the injection conditions
by the pulsar wind reflect in the nebular dynamics. To achieve a good coverage
of the available parameter space we have run several simulations varying those
parameters that are most representative of the wind properties: the latitudinal
anisotropy of the wind energy flux with respect to the pulsar spin axis, the
level of magnetization, the inclination of the pulsar spin axis with respect to
the pulsar direction of motion. We have followed the dynamics in these systems,
not just in the very head, but also in the tail, trying to assess if and how
the system retains memory of the injection at large distances from the pulsar
itself. In this paper we focus our attention on the characterization of the
fluid structure and magnetic field properties. We have tried to evaluate the
level of turbulence in the tail, and its relation to injection, the survival of
current sheets, and the degree of mixing between the shocked ambient medium and
the relativistic pulsar wind material.

appeared in K\""oMaL in April 2010, and the general version appeared in May 2010
on MathOverflow, posted by P\'alv\""olgyi. The question remains open. We discuss
the known partial results and investigate a series of related matters
attempting to understand the structure of these $n$-satisfactory colorings.
  Specifically, we show that there is an $n$-satisfactory coloring whenever
there is an abelian group operation $\oplus$ on the set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$
compatible with multiplication in the sense that whenever $i$, $j$ and $ij$ are
in $\{1,\dots,n\}$, then $ij=i\oplus j$. This includes in particular the cases
where $n+1$ is prime, or $2n+1$ is prime, or $n=p^2-p$ for some prime $p$, or
there is a $k$ such that $q=nk+1$ is prime and $1^k,\dots,n^k$ are all distinct
modulo $q$ (in which case we call $q$ a strong representative of order $n$).
The colorings obtained by this process we call multiplicative. We also show
that nonmultiplicative colorings exist for some values of $n$.
  There is an $n$-satisfactory coloring of $\mathbb Z^+$ if and only if there
is such a coloring of the set $K_n$ of $n$-smooth numbers. We identify all
$n$-satisfactory colorings for $n\le 5$ and all multiplicative colorings for
$n\le 8$, and show that there are as many nonmultiplicative colorings of $K_n$
as there are real numbers for $n=6$ and 8. We show that if $n$ admits a strong
representative $q$ then the set of such $q$ has positive natural density in the
set of all primes.
  We show that the question of whether there is an $n$-satisfactory coloring is
equivalent to a problem about tilings, and use this to give a geometric
characterization of multiplicative colorings.

Despite the abundance of potential applications of Combinatorial BO, including

COMBO quantifies ""smoothness"" of functions on combinatorial search spaces by
utilizing a combinatorial graph. The vertex set of the combinatorial graph
consists of all possible joint assignments of the variables, while edges are
constructed using the graph Cartesian product of the sub-graphs that represent
the individual variables. On this combinatorial graph, we propose an ARD
diffusion kernel with which the GP is able to model high-order interactions
between variables leading to better performance. Moreover, using the Horseshoe
prior for the scale parameter in the ARD diffusion kernel results in an
effective variable selection procedure, making COMBO suitable for high
dimensional problems. Computationally, in COMBO the graph Cartesian product
allows the Graph Fourier Transform calculation to scale linearly instead of
exponentially. We validate COMBO in a wide array of realistic benchmarks,
including weighted maximum satisfiability problems and neural architecture
search. COMBO outperforms consistently the latest state-of-the-art while
maintaining computational and statistical efficiency.

architecture with multitask output to build a factor model over time and infer
latent variables that render the assigned treatments conditionally independent;
then, it performs causal inference using these latent variables that act as
substitutes for the multi-cause unobserved confounders. We provide a
theoretical analysis for obtaining unbiased causal effects of time-varying

the energy space $H^1\times H^1$. This model, introduced by Bona, Chen and
Saut, is a well-known physical generalization of the classical Boussinesq
equations. The Hamiltonian case corresponds to the regime where $a,c<0$ and
$b=d>0$. Under this regime, small solutions in the energy space are globally
defined. A first proof of decay for this $2\times 2$ system was given by the
two authors and Poblete and Pozo, in a strongly dispersive regime, i.e. under
essentially the conditions \[ b=d > \frac29, \quad a,c<-\frac1{18}. \]
Additionally, decay was obtained inside a proper subset of the light cone
$(-|t|,|t|)$. In this paper, we improve the last result in three directions.
First, we enlarge the set of parameters $(a,b,c,d)$ for which decay to zero is
the only available option, considering now the so-called weakly dispersive
regime $a,c\sim 0$: we prove decay if now \[ b=d > \frac3{16}, \quad
a,c<-\frac1{48}. \] This result is sharp in the case where $a=c$, since for
$a,c$ bigger, some $abcd$ linear waves of nonzero frequency do have zero group
velocity. Second, we sharply enlarge the interval of decay to consider the
whole light cone, that is to say, any interval of the form $|x|\sim |v|t$, for
any $|v|<1$. This result rules out, among other things, the existence of
nonzero speed solitary waves in the regime where decay is present. Finally, we
prove decay to zero of small $abcd$ solutions in exterior regions $|x|\gg |t|$,
also discarding super-luminical small solitary waves. These three results are
obtained by performing new improved virial estimates for which better decay
properties are deduced.

examines field-strength descriptions for an extended system of SU(2) charges
with spherical symmetry and imposes alternate confining boundary conditions to
the time-independent Yang-Mills Maxwell equations. Three types of global
solutions to the set of equations can be distinguished: types 0,1,and2. Type-0
solutions evade the nonlinear dynamics associated with the radial magnetic
field to describe a topologically trivial bound state. Type-1 and type-2
solutions both require a domain wall of topological charge to separate the
interior volume containing the SU(2) charge densities from the exterior volume
where the boundary conditions are imposed. Type-1 solutions describe an
exterior volume with a radial magnetic field while type-2 solutions contain a
sterile exterior volume where all field-strengths vanish. These solutions both
describe a non-Abelian ""spherical dual topological insulator"". the dimensional
reduction associated with the imposition of spherical system of SU(2) charges
can also be applied to SU(3) charges so this simple exercise is directly
relevant to understanding confinement in QCD.

near-term quantum technologies, an outstanding challenge is to identify
specific problems of practical interest where these quantum devices can prove
useful. Here we show that Gaussian Boson Samplers can be used to predict
molecular docking configurations: the spatial orientations that molecules
assume when they bind to larger proteins. Molecular docking is a central
problem for pharmaceutical drug design, where docking configurations must be
predicted for large numbers of candidate molecules. We develop a
vertex-weighted binding interaction graph approach, where the molecular docking
problem is reduced to finding the maximum weighted clique in a graph. We show
that Gaussian Boson Samplers can be programmed to sample large-weight cliques,
i.e., stable docking configurations, with high probability, even in the
presence of photon loss. We also describe how outputs from the device can be
used to enhance the performance of classical algorithms and increase their
success rate of finding the molecular binding pose. To benchmark our approach,
we predict the binding mode of a small molecule ligand to the tumor necrosis

The dynamical properties in the non-interacting regime are studied using an

following the well-known non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. By
means of mutual information and concurrence we explore the connection between
the quantum correlations in the system and the current flowing through the
dots. It is observed that entanglement between the dots is heavily influenced
by the degeneracy or the lack thereof, of the dot levels. In the non-degenerate
case, the concurrence falls sharply when the applied bias crosses a certain
critical value. In contrast when the dot energy levels are degenerate, the
concurrence reaches a very high asymptotic value of 1/2. When interactions are
switched on, the degeneracy is lifted, and once again concurrence falls to zero
beyond a critical value of the applied bias. Lastly it is observed that the
concurrence can be made to reach almost the value of 1.0 if the chemical
potential in both baths is made very large (while keeping the sign the same)
provided the dot levels are kept degenerate within the non-interacting limit. A
combination of NEGF method, brute-force numerics and asymptotics are employed

utilizes Boolean difference calculus to estimate the maximum error rate that
each node of the given network can tolerate such that the total error rate at

rate, and the worst case delay and the total area are minimized. Maximum

(PSD), calculated by taking an appropriate Fourier transform of individual
trajectories and finding the associated ensemble-average. Frequently, the
available experimental data sets are too small for such ensemble averages, and
hence it is of a great conceptual and practical importance to understand to
which extent relevant information can be gained from $S(f,T)$, the PSD of a
single trajectory. Here we focus on the behavior of this random,
realization-dependent variable, parametrized by frequency $f$ and
observation-time $T$, for a broad family of anomalous diffusions---fractional
Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst-index $H$---and derive exactly its probability
density function. We show that $S(f,T)$ is proportional---up to a random
numerical factor whose universal distribution we determine---to the
ensemble-averaged PSD. For subdiffusion ($H<1/2$) we find that $S(f,T)\sim
A/f^{2H+1}$ with random-amplitude $A$. In sharp contrast, for superdiffusion
$(H>1/2)$ $S(f,T)\sim BT^{2H-1}/f^2$ with random amplitude $B$. Remarkably, for
$H>1/2$ the PSD exhibits the same frequency-dependence as Brownian motion, a
deceptive property that may lead to false conclusions when interpreting
experimental data. Notably, for $H>1/2$ the PSD is ageing and is dependent on
$T$. Our predictions for both sub- and superdiffusion are confirmed by
experiments in live cells and in agarose hydrogels, and by extensive
simulations.

the same time, their statistical mechanics has been thoroughly studied. Here we
recapitulate their original motivation in the context of current theoretical
and empirical research. We discuss ensembles of random Boolean networks whose
dynamical attractors model cell types. A sub-ensemble is the critical ensemble.
There is now strong evidence that genetic regulatory networks are dynamically
critical, and that evolution is exploring the critical sub-ensemble. The
generic properties of this sub-ensemble predict essential features of cell
differentiation. In particular, the number of attractors in such networks
scales as the DNA content raised to the 0.63 power. Data on the number of cell
types as a function of the DNA content per cell shows a scaling relationship of
0.88. Thus, the theory correctly predicts a power law relationship between the
number of cell types and the DNA contents per cell, and a comparable slope. We
discuss these new scaling values and show prospects for new research lines for
Boolean networks as a base model for systems biology.

  quantifying transient bradycardia measured by electrocardiogram","One table and 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background. Most surgical procedures involve structures deeper than the skin.
However, the difference in surgical noxious stimulation between skin incision
and laparoscopic trocar insertion is unknown. By analyzing instantaneous heart
rate (IHR) calculated from the electrocardiogram, in particular the transient
bradycardia in response to surgical stimuli, this study investigates surgical
noxious stimuli arising from skin incision and laparoscopic trocar insertion.
Methods. Thirty-five patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were
enrolled in this prospective observational study. Sequential surgical steps
including umbilical skin incision (11 mm), umbilical trocar insertion (11 mm),
xiphoid skin incision (5 mm), xiphoid trocar insertion (5 mm), subcostal skin
incision (3 mm), and subcostal trocar insertion (3 mm) were investigated. IHR
was derived from electrocardiography and calculated by the modern time-varying
power spectrum. Similar to the classical heart rate variability analysis, the
time-varying low frequency power (tvLF), time-varying high frequency power
(tvHF), and tvLF-to-tvHF ratio (tvLHR) were calculated. Prediction probability
(PK) analysis and global pointwise F-test were used to compare the performance
between indices and the heart rate readings from the patient monitor. Results.
Analysis of IHR showed that surgical stimulus elicits a transient bradycardia,
followed by the increase of heart rate. Transient bradycardia is more
significant in trocar insertion than skin incision. The IHR change quantifies
differential responses to different surgical intensity. Serial PK analysis
demonstrates de-sensitization in skin incision, but not in laparoscopic trocar
insertion. Conclusions. Quantitative indices present the transient bradycardia
introduced by noxious stimulation. The results indicate different effects
between skin incision and trocar insertion.

Linked Data sets in a fully unsupervised manner. Our inference technique
leverages a new hierarchical clustering algorithm that is robust, highly
effective, and scalable. We introduce a novel approach to reduce the processing
complexity of the similarity matrix specifying the relations between various

while also improving the correctness of the inferred types due to the noise
attenuation in the input data. We further optimize the clustering process by
introducing a dedicated hash function that speeds up the inference process by
orders of magnitude without negatively affecting its accuracy. Finally, we
describe a new technique to identify representative clusters from the
multi-scale output of our clustering algorithm to further improve the accuracy
of the inferred types. We empirically evaluate our approach on several
real-world datasets and compare it to the state of the art. Our results show
that StaTIX is more efficient than existing methods (both in terms of speed and
memory consumption) as well as more effective. StaTIX reduces the F1-score

phases in noncrystalline or amorphous materials. Starting from two and three
dimensional crystalline HOT insulators, accommodating topological corner
states, we gradually enhance structural randomness in the system. Within a
parameter regime, as long as amorphousness is confined by outer crystalline
boundary, the system continues to host corner states, yielding amorphous HOT
insulators. However, as structural disorder percolates to the edges, corner
states start to dissolve into amorphous bulk, and ultimately the system becomes
a trivial insulator when amorphousness plagues the entire system. These
outcomes are further substantiated by computing the quadrupolar (octupolar)
moment in two (three) dimensions. Therefore, HOT phases can be realized in
amorphous solids, when wrapped by a thin (lithographically grown, for example)
crystalline layer. Our findings suggest that crystalline topological phases can
be realized even in the absence of local crystalline symmetry.

observationally through radio-loudness, is invoked in all cosmological galaxy
formation models as a mechanism that prevents excessive star-formation in
massive galaxies (M$_*$ $\gtrsim$ 3$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$). We
demonstrate that at a fixed mass the incidence of radio-loud AGN (L $>$
10$^{23}$ WHz$^{- 1}$) identified in the FIRST and NVSS radio surveys among a
large sample of quiescent (non-star forming) galaxies selected from the SDSS is
much higher in geometrically round galaxies than in geometrically flat,
disk-like galaxies. As found previously, the RL AGN fraction increases steeply
with stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_*$ and stellar mass, but even at a
fixed velocity dispersion of 200-250 kms$^{-1}$ this fraction increases from
0.3% for flat galaxies (projected axis ratio of q $<$ 0.4) to 5% for round
galaxies (q $>$ 0.8). We rule out that this strong trend is due to projection
effects in the measured velocity dispersion. The large fraction of radio-loud
AGN in massive, round galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that such AGN
deposit energy into their hot gaseous halos, preventing cooling and
star-formation. However, the absence of such AGN in disk-like quiescent
galaxies -- most of which are not satellites in massive clusters, raises
important questions: is maintenance-mode feedback a generally valid explanation
for quiescence; and, if so, how does that feedback avoid manifesting at least
occasionally as a radio-loud galaxy?

to answer the question: what are the properties of a superconducting state
where the force driving cooper pairing becomes dissipative? We find that when
the bosonic mediator is local, dissipation acts to reduce the superconducting
critical temperature ($T_c$). On the other hand, contrary to na\""{i}ve
expectations, $T_c$ behaves non-monotonically with dissipation for a non-local
mediator -- weakly dissipative bosons at different energy scales act coherently
to give rise to an increase in $T_c$ and eventually destroy superconductivity
when the dissipation exceeds a critical value. The critical value occurs when
dissipative effects become comparable to the energy scale associated with the
spatial stiffness of the mediator, at which point, $T_c$ acquires a maximum. We
outline consequences of our results to recent proton irradiation experiments

Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, this document has been prepared by members of the
physics, astronomy, computer science, data science, software and
cyberinfrastructure communities who attended the NSF-, DOE- and NVIDIA-funded
""Deep Learning for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics: Real-time Discovery at Scale""
workshop, hosted at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,
October 17-19, 2018. Highlights of this report include unanimous agreement that
it is critical to accelerate the development and deployment of novel,
signal-processing algorithms that use the synergy between artificial
intelligence (AI) and high performance computing to maximize the potential for
scientific discovery with Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. We discuss key aspects
to realize this endeavor, namely (i) the design and exploitation of scalable
and computationally efficient AI algorithms for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics;
(ii) cyberinfrastructure requirements to numerically simulate astrophysical
sources, and to process and interpret Multi-Messenger Astrophysics data; (iii)
management of gravitational wave detections and triggers to enable
electromagnetic and astro-particle follow-ups; (iv) a vision to harness future
developments of machine and deep learning and cyberinfrastructure resources to
cope with the scale of discovery in the Big Data Era; (v) and the need to build
a community that brings domain experts together with data scientists on equal
footing to maximize and accelerate discovery in the nascent field of
Multi-Messenger Astrophysics.

languages and distributed systems. On one hand, reactive programming is a
paradigm which provides programmers with the means to declaratively write
event-driven applications. On the other hand, reactive distributed systems
handle client requests in a timely fashion regardless of load or failures.
Inquiry: Reactive programming languages and frameworks tailored to the
implementation of distributed systems have previously been proposed. However,
we argue that these approaches are ill fit to implement reactive distributed
systems. Approach: We analyse state of the art runtimes for distributed
reactive programming and identify two key issues with regards to reactive
distributed systems. They rely on single, central points of coordination and/or
assume a lack of partial failures in the systems they support. Knowledge: Based
on our analysis we propose a novel runtime for distributed reactive programming
languages and frameworks. This runtime supports reactive distributed systems by
design. Grounding: We implement a proof of concept framework for reactive
distributed systems in JavaScript which builds atop our runtime. Using this
framework we implement a case study application which highlights the
applicability of our approach. Moreover, we benchmark our runtime against a
similar approach in order to showcase its runtime properties and we prove its
correctness. Importance: This work aims to bridge the gap between two kinds of
reactivity: reactive distributed systems and distributed reactive programming.
Current distributed reactive programming approaches do not support reactive
distributed systems. Our runtime is the first to bridge this reactivity gap: it
allows for reactive distributed systems to be implemented using distributed
reactive programming.

there has been an urgent need for languages that ease the writing of correct
parallel programs. ParaSail achieves these goals largely through simplification
of the language, rather than by adding numerous rules. In particular, ParaSail
eliminates global variables, parameter aliasing, and most significantly,
re-assignable pointers. ParaSail has adopted a pointer-free approach to
defining complex data structures. Rather than using pointers, ParaSail supports
flexible data structuring using expandable (and shrinkable) objects implemented
using region-based storage management, along with generalized indexing. By
eliminating global variables, parameter aliasing, and pointers, ParaSail
reduces the complexity for the programmer, while still allowing ParaSail to
provide flexible, pervasive, safe, parallel programming for irregular
computations. Perhaps the most interesting discovery in this language
development effort, based on over six years of use by the author and a group of
ParaSail users, has been that it is possible to simultaneously simplify the
language, support parallel programming with advanced data structures, and
maintain flexibility and efficiency.

Software systems comprise of data that are noisy and missing, which makes

various views including the module dependency graph, execution logs,
evolutionary information and the vocabulary used in the source code, that
collectively defines the software system. Each of these views contain unique
and complementary information; together which can more accurately describe the
data. In this paper, we investigate various techniques for combining different
sources of information to improve the performance of a program comprehension
task. We employ state-of-the-art techniques from learning to 1) find a suitable
similarity function for each view, and 2) compare different multi-view learning
techniques to decompose a software system into high-level units and give
component-level recommendations for refactoring of the system, as well as
cross-view source code search. The experiments conducted on 10 relatively large
Java software systems show that by fusing knowledge from different views, we
can guarantee a lower bound on the quality of the modularization and even
improve upon it. We proceed by integrating different sources of information to
give a set of high-level recommendations as to how to refactor the software
system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how learning a joint subspace allows for
performing cross-modal retrieval across views, yielding results that are more
aligned with what the user intends by the query. The multi-view approaches
outlined in this paper can be employed for addressing problems in software
engineering that can be encoded in terms of a learning problem, such as

reinforcement learning (RL) problems when dense reward function is provided.
However, in sparse reward environment it still often suffers from the need to
carefully shape reward function to guide policy optimization. This limits the
applicability of RL in the real world since both reinforcement learning and
domain-specific knowledge are required. It is therefore of great practical
importance to develop algorithms which can learn from a binary signal
indicating successful task completion or other unshaped, sparse reward signals.
We propose a novel method called competitive experience replay, which
efficiently supplements a sparse reward by placing learning in the context of
an exploration competition between a pair of agents. Our method complements the
recently proposed hindsight experience replay (HER) by inducing an automatic
exploratory curriculum. We evaluate our approach on the tasks of reaching
various goal locations in an ant maze and manipulating objects with a robotic
arm. Each task provides only binary rewards indicating whether or not the goal
is achieved. Our method asymmetrically augments these sparse rewards for a pair
of agents each learning the same task, creating a competitive game designed to
drive exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method leads to
faster converge and improved task performance.

scientific challenge for more than three decades. This challenge is perhaps
best exemplified by the need to understand the normal-state charge transport as
the system evolves from Mott insulator to Fermi-liquid metal with doping. Here
we report a detailed analysis of the temperature (T) and doping (p) dependence
of the planar resistivity of simple-tetragonal HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
(Hg1201), the single-CuO$_2$-layer cuprate with the highest optimal $T_c$. The
data allow us to test a recently proposed phenomenological model for the
cuprate phase diagram that combines a universal transport scattering rate with
spatially inhomogeneous (de)localization of the Mott-localized hole. We find
that the model provides an excellent description of the data. We then extend
this analysis to prior transport results for several other cuprates, including
the Hall number in the overdoped part of the phase diagram, and find little
compound-to-compound variation in (de)localization gap scale. The results point
to a robust, universal structural origin of the inherent gap inhomogeneity that
is unrelated to doping-related disorder. They are inconsistent with the notion
that much of the phase diagram is controlled by a quantum critical point, and
instead indicate that the unusual electronic properties exhibited by the
cuprates are fundamentally related to strong nonlinearities associated with
subtle nanoscale inhomogeneity.

covering 568 square degrees at high Galactic latitudes, at 4.3' angular
resolution and 1 rad m$^{-2}$ Faraday depth resolution, with a typical noise
level of 50--100 $\mu$Jy per point spread function (PSF) per rotation measure
spread function (RMSF) (40-80 mK RMSF$^{-1}$). While parts of the images are
strongly affected by instrumental polarization, we observe diffuse polarized
emission throughout most of the field, with typical brightness between 1 and 6
K RMSF$^{-1}$, and Faraday depths between $-7$ and +25 rad m$^{-2}$.
  We observed many new polarization features, some up to 15 degrees in length.
These include two regions with very uniformly structured, linear gradients in
the Faraday depth; we measured the steepness of these gradients as 2.6 and 13
rad m$^{-2}$ deg$^{-1}$. We also observed a relationship between one of the
gradients and an HI filament in the local ISM. Other ISM tracers were also
checked for correlations with our polarization data and none were found, but
very little signal was seen in most tracers in this region. We conclude that
the LOTSS data are very well suited for Faraday tomography, and that a
full-scale survey with all the LOTSS data has the potential to reveal many new
Galactic polarization features and map out diffuse Faraday depth structure
across the entire northern hemisphere.

popular microblogging website in China. Does a universal mechanism with a
common set of dynamical rules exist, which can explain these empirically
observed, distinct growth behaviors? We provide an affirmative answer in this
paper. In particular, inspired by biomimicry to take advantage of cell
population growth dynamics in microbial ecology, we construct a base growth
model for meme popularity in OSNs. We then take into account human factors by
incorporating a general model of human interest dynamics into the base model.
The final hybrid model contains a small number of free parameters that can be
estimated purely from data. We demonstrate that our model is universal in the
sense that, with a few parameters estimated from data, it can successfully
predict the distinct meme growth dynamics. Our study represents a successful
effort to exploit principles in biology to understand online social behaviors

between different neutrino oscillation experiments. Intriguingly, it also
offers a possible solution to the discrepant cosmological measurements of $H_0$

until close to the epoch of matter-radiation equality can naturally accommodate
a larger value for the Hubble constant $H_0=72.3 \pm 1.4$ km/s/Mpc and a lower
value of the matter fluctuations $\sigma_8=0.786\pm 0.020$, while not degrading
the fit to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) damping tail. We achieve this
by introducing neutrino self-interactions in the presence of a non-vanishing
sum of neutrino masses. This strongly interacting neutrino cosmology prefers
$N_{\rm eff} = 4.02 \pm 0.29$, which has interesting implications for particle
model-building and neutrino oscillation anomalies. We show that the absence of
the neutrino free-streaming phase shift on the CMB can be compensated by
shifting the value of other cosmological parameters, hence providing an
important caveat to the detections made in the literature. Due to their impact
on the evolution of the gravitational potential at early times,
self-interacting neutrinos and their subsequent decoupling leave a rich
structure on the matter power spectrum. In particular, we point out the
existence of a novel localized feature appearing on scales entering the horizon
at the onset of neutrino free-streaming. While the interacting neutrino
cosmology provides a better global fit to current cosmological data, we find
that traditional Bayesian analyses penalize the model as compared to the
standard cosmological. Our analysis shows that it is possible to find radically
different cosmological models that nonetheless provide excellent fits to the
data, hence providing an impetus to thoroughly explore alternate cosmological
scenarios.

regression. While optimal rate in nonparametric estimation can be achieved and
utilized to construct sharp confidence sets, severe degradation of confidence
level often happens after estimating the degree of smoothness. Similarly, for
high-dimensional regression, oracle inequalities for sparse estimators could be
utilized to construct sharp confidence sets. Yet the degree of sparsity itself
is unknown and needs to be estimated, causing the honesty problem. To resolve
this issue, we develop a novel method to construct honest confidence sets for
sparse high-dimensional linear regression. The key idea in our construction is
to separate signals into a strong and a weak group, and then construct
confidence sets for each group separately. This is achieved by a projection and
shrinkage approach, the latter implemented via Stein estimation and the
associated Stein unbiased risk estimate. Our confidence set is honest over the
full parameter space without any sparsity constraints, while its diameter
adapts to the optimal rate of $n^{-1/4}$ when the true parameter is indeed
sparse. Through extensive numerical comparisons, we demonstrate that our method
outperforms other competitors with big margins for finite samples, including
oracle methods built upon the true sparsity of the underlying model.

Electromagnetic (EM) radiation needs to be correctly addressed. In recent years
it became clear that scattering of EM radiation from interstellar dust grains
could change the local properties of the observed Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) radiation. Here we consider the relevant processes of emission and
scattering of EM radiation from spinning dust particles, and discuss their
possible influence on the CMB. In particular, we show that scattered radiation
can establish a correlation between different spectral components of galactic
dipolar emission. This could explain the observed correlation between the CMB
and the 100-micron thermal emission form interstellar dust. Another important
property of CMB is related with its polarisation anisotropies, and the
observation of a cosmological B-mode. We show that scattering of CMB radiation
from dust grains in the presence of a static magnetic field could indeed create
a B-mode spectral component, which is very similar to that due to primordial
gravitational waves. This can be described by a kind of Cotton-Mutton effect on
the CMB radiation.

compression-based defense framework for countering adversarial attacks on image
classification models, which was published at KDD 2018. Here, we consider
alternative threat models not studied in the original work, where we assume
that an adaptive adversary is aware of the ensemble defense approach, the
defensive pre-processing, and the architecture and weights of the models used
in the ensemble. We define scenarios with varying levels of threat and
empirically analyze the proposed defense by varying the degree of information
available to the attacker, spanning from a full white-box attack to the
gray-box threat model described in the original work. To evaluate the
robustness of the defense against an adaptive attacker, we consider the
targeted-attack success rate of the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack,
which is a strong gradient-based adversarial attack proposed in adversarial
machine learning research. We also experiment with training the SHIELD ensemble
from scratch, which is different from re-training using a pre-trained model as
done in the original work. We find that the targeted PGD attack has a success
rate of 64.3% against the original SHIELD ensemble in the full white box
scenario, but this drops to 48.9% if the models used in the ensemble are
trained from scratch instead of being retrained. Our experiments further reveal
that an ensemble whose models are re-trained indeed have higher correlation in
the cosine similarity space, and models that are trained from scratch are less
vulnerable to targeted attacks in the white-box and gray-box scenarios.

and transforming syntax trees. Many meta programming systems process abstract
syntax trees, but this requires intimate knowledge of the structure of the data
type describing the abstract syntax. As a result, meta programming is
error-prone, and meta programs are not resilient to evolution of the structure
of such ASTs, requiring invasive, fault-prone change to these programs.
Inquiry: Concrete syntax patterns alleviate this problem by allowing the meta
programmer to match and create syntax trees using the actual syntax of the
object language. Systems supporting concrete syntax patterns, however, require
a concrete grammar of the object language in their own formalism. Creating such
grammars is a costly and error-prone process, especially for realistic
languages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely,
a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax
patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the
context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language
workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, JavaScript, and
C++. Furthermore, we propose Tympanic, a DSL to declaratively map external AST
structures to Rascal's internal data structures. Tympanic allows implementors
of Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class
hierarchies in Java and Rascal's algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data
type and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The
conceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of
pre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta
programming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and
constructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern
matching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from
scratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength
parsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source
lines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling
code. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding
support for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of
dozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic in terms of SLOC, showing an
order of magnitude of reduction in SLOC compared to manual implementation of
the AST data types and marshalling code. Importance: Meta programming has
applications in reverse engineering, reengineering, source code analysis,
static analysis, software renovation, domain-specific language engineering, and
many others. Processing of syntax trees is central to all of these tasks.
Concrete syntax patterns improve the practice of constructing meta programs.
The combination of Concretely and Tympanic has the potential to make concrete
syntax patterns available with very little effort, thereby improving and
promoting the application of meta programming in the general software
engineering context.

describes the interactive structure of a fixed number of components from a
global point of view and type-checks the components through projection of the
global type onto the participants of the session. They guarantee
communicationsafety for a language of multiparty sessions (LMS), i.e.,
distributed, parallel components can exchange values without deadlocking and
unexpected message types. Several variants of MST and LMS have been proposed to
study key features of distributed and parallel programming. We observe that the
population of the considered variants follows from only one ancestor, i.e., the
original LMS/MST, and there are overlapping traits between features of the
considered variants and the original. These hamper evolution of session types
and languages and their adoption in practice. This paper addresses the
following question: What are the essential features for MST and LMS, and how
can these be modelled with simple constructs? To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time this question has been addressed. We performed a
systematic analysis of the features and the constructs in MST, LMS, and the
considered variants to identify the essential features. The variants are among
the most influential (according to Google Scholar) and well-established systems
that cover a wide set of areas in distributed, parallel programming. We used
classical techniques of formal models such as BNF, structural congruence, small
step operational semantics and typing judgments to build our language and type
system. Lastly, the coherence of operational semantics and type system is
proven by induction. This paper proposes a set of essential features, a
language of structured interactions and a type theory of comprehensive
multiparty session types, including global types and type system. The analysis
removes overlapping features and captures the shared traits, thereby
introducing the essential features. The constructs of the language are simple
and fundamental, based on the $\lambda$ and $\pi$ calculi. Analogously, our
global types reflect what is omitted and introduced in the language. Our system
covers all the features of the original and variants, with a better ratio of
the number of language and type constructs over the number of covered features.
The features of the original, variants, and our system along with the number of
constructs in the respective language and global types to model them are
presented through a table. The syntax, operational semantics, meta-theory and
type system of our system are given. We modelled all the motivating examples of
the variants in our model, describing the reduction and typing steps. The work
discusses how new features, in particular the non-essential ones (formerly
excluded) and advanced ones can be either modelled atop the essential ones or
added with minimal efforts, i.e. without modifying the existing ones. The
fundamental properties of typed processes such as subject reduction,
communication safety, and progress are established.

reuse for object oriented (OO) languages. One of the main advantages of this
kind of composition is that it makes possible to separate subtyping from
subclassing; which is good for code-reuse, design and reasoning. However,
handling of state within traits is difficult, verbose or inelegant. Inquiry: We
identify the this-leaking problem as the fundamental limitation that prevents
the separation of subtyping from subclassing in conventional OO languages. We
explain that the concept of trait composition addresses this problem, by
distinguishing code designed for use (as a type) from code designed for reuse
(i.e. inherited). We are aware of at least 3 concrete independently designed
research languages following this methodology: TraitRecordJ, Package Templates
and DeepFJig. Approach: In this paper, we design $42_\mu$ a new language, where
we improve use and reuse and support the This type and family polymorphism by
distinguishing code designed for use from code designed for reuse. In this way
$42_\mu$ synthesise the 3 approaches above, and improves them with abstract
state operations: a new elegant way to handle state composition in trait based
languages. Knowledge and Grounding: Using case studies, we show that $42_\mu$'s
model of traits with abstract state operations is more usable and compact than
prior work. We formalise our work and prove that type errors cannot arise from
composing well typed code. Importance: This work is the logical core of the
programming language 42. This shows that the ideas presented in this paper can
be applicable to a full general purpose language. This form of composition is
very flexible and could be used in many new languages.

collapse. Stars from 8-M$_{\odot}$ to 13-M$_{\odot}$ constitute roughly 50% of
all massive stars, so the explosive potential for this mass range is important
to the overall theory of CCSNe. We find that the 9-, 10-, 11-, and
12-M$_{\odot}$ models explode in 3D easily, but that the 13-M$_{\odot}$ model
does not. From these findings, and the fact that slightly more massive
progenitors seem to explode \citep{vartanyan2019}, we suggest that there is a
gap in explodability near 12-M$_{\odot}$ to 14-M$_{\odot}$ for non-rotating
progenitor stars. Factors conducive to explosion are turbulence behind the
stalled shock, energy transfer due to neutrino-matter absorption and
neutrino-matter scattering, many-body corrections to the neutrino-nucleon
scattering rate, and the presence of a sharp silicon-oxygen interface in the
progenitor. Our 3D exploding models frequently have a dipolar structure, with
the two asymmetrical exploding lobes separated by a pinched waist where matter
temporarily continues to accrete. This process maintains the driving neutrino
luminosty, while partially shunting matter out of the way of the expanding
lobes, thereby modestly facilitating explosion. The morphology of all 3D
explosions is characterized by multiple bubble structures with a range of
low-order harmonic modes. Though much remains to be done in CCSN theory, these
and other results in the literature suggest that, at least for these lower-mass
progenitors, supernova theory is converging on a credible solution.

used approach to DSLs in various languages, including Haskell and Scala. There
are two main implementation techniques for EDSLs: shallow embeddings and deep
embeddings. Inquiry: Shallow embeddings are quite simple, but they have been
criticized in the past for being quite limited in terms of modularity and
reuse. In particular, it is often argued that supporting multiple DSL
interpretations in shallow embeddings is difficult. Approach: This paper argues
that shallow EDSLs and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are closely related.
Gibbons and Wu already discussed the relationship between shallow EDSLs and
procedural abstraction, while Cook discussed the connection between procedural
abstraction and OOP. We make the transitive step in this paper by connecting
shallow EDSLs directly to OOP via procedural abstraction. The knowledge about
this relationship enables us to improve on implementation techniques for EDSLs.
Knowledge: This paper argues that common OOP mechanisms (including inheritance,
subtyping, and type-refinement) increase the modularity and reuse of shallow
EDSLs when compared to classical procedural abstraction by enabling a simple
way to express multiple, possibly dependent, interpretations. Grounding: We
make our arguments by using Gibbons and Wu's examples, where procedural
abstraction is used in Haskell to model a simple shallow EDSL. We recode that
EDSL in Scala and with an improved OO-inspired Haskell encoding. We further
illustrate our approach with a case study on refactoring a deep external SQL
query processor to make it more modular, shallow, and embedded. Importance:
This work is important for two reasons. Firstly, from an intellectual point of
view, this work establishes the connection between shallow embeddings and OOP,
which enables a better understanding of both concepts. Secondly, this work
illustrates programming techniques that can be used to improve the modularity
and reuse of shallow EDSLs.

divide between code and behavior often remains. The goal of example-based live
programming is to remove this gap by allowing programmers to explore the actual
behavior of their code during development. This is achieved by defining live
examples for parts of the application. The idea of live examples has been
already addressed in other tools and environments. However, most of those
solutions are limited to specific domains and are suitable only for small
programs. Thus, we aim to extend the application of example-based live
programming to more complex programs potentially spanning multiple modules. We
investigate existing solutions to derive a set of requirements for an
integration of live examples into source code. Based on these requirements we
propose a new approach to live examples and present a prototype in its support.
We reproduce, discuss, and extend scenarios from related work to show the

with that also more realistic scenarios. Also, we measure and evaluate the

that example-based live programming can provide more insights into the run-time

unsolved and new challenges affecting example-based live programming

we establish a direct link between the null geodesics and the critical behavior

and the impact parameter corresponding to the unstable circular orbits can be
used to probe the thermodynamic phase structure. We also show that the latter
are key quantities to characterize the order of Van der Waals-like phase

these results support further that the photon trajectories can be used as a
useful and crucial tool to probe the thermodynamic black holes criticality.

interpretation from three-dimensional (3D) seismic data (e.g., fault/fracture
detection and geomorphology delineation) by measuring the lateral changes in
the geometry of seismic events. However, such geometric curvature utilizes only
the kinematic information (two-way traveltime) of the available seismic
signals. While analyzing the dynamic information (waveform), the traditional
approaches (e.g., complex trace analysis) are often trace-wise and thereby fail
to take into account the seismic reflector continuity and deviate from the true
direction of geologic deposition, especially for steeply dipping formations.
This study proposes extending the 3D curvature analysis to the waveforms in a
seismic profile, here denoted as the waveform curvature, and investigates the
associated implications for assisting seismic interpretation. Applications to
the F3 seismic dataset over the Netherlands North Sea demonstrate the added
values of the proposed waveform curvature analysis in four aspects. First, the
capability of the curvature operator in differentiating convex and concave
bending allows automatic decomposition of a seismic image by the reflector
types (peaks, troughs and zero-crossings), which can greatly facilitate
computer-aided horizon interpretation and modelling from 3D seismic data.
Second, the signed minimum curvature offers a new analytical approach for
estimating the fundamental and important reflector dip attribute by searching
the orientation associated with least waveform variation. Third, the signed
maximum curvature makes it possible to analyze the seismic signals along the
normal direction of the reflection events. Finally, the curvature analysis
promotes the frequency bands of the seismic signals and thereby enhances the
apparent resolution on identifying and interpreting subtle seismic features.

The monolithic design of SDN controllers restricts programmers who build

SDN controller must be recompiled whenever a change is made, and does not

To overcome the weaknesses inherent in the monolithic approach, the next
generation of SDN controllers must use a distributed, microservice architecture

a set of cooperative microservices. In this paper, we explain the steps that
are required to migrate from a monolithic to a microservice architecture and

been attributed tofluctuations in the mass accretion rate from the

monitoring the response of the dust envelope at mid-IR to millimeter

to observe small fluctuations in brightness at the scale of the disk where

0.04-2 kpc from the Sun. The photometric parallaxes {\pi}_Phot of the eclipsing
binaries were determined by applying a number of empirical surface brightness -
color (SBC) relations calibrated on optical-infrared colors. For each SBC
relation we calculated the individual differences d{\pi}_i = ({\pi}_Gaia -
{\pi}_Phot)_i and then we calculated unweighted and weighted means. As the
sample covers the whole sky we interpret the weighted means as the global
shifts of the Gaia DR2 parallaxes with respect to our eclipsing binary sample.
Depending on the choice of the SBC relation the shifts vary from -0.094 mas to
-0.025 mas. The weighted mean of the zero-point shift from all colors and
calibrations used is d{\pi} = -0.054 +/- 0.024 mas. However, the SBC relations
based on (B-K) and (V-K) colors, which are the least reddening dependent and
have the lowest intrinsic dispersions, give a zero-point shift of d{\pi} =

Self-normalized training coupled with Trie-based dynamic pruning dramatically
reduces the inference time, yielding a speedup of more than 20 times. We also
devise an mixed online-offline serving architecture to reduce the latency and
CPU consumption. To encourage the NMT to generate new keywords uncovered by the

Polyanskiy's achievability bound of a system limited to stop feedback. This
paper significantly tightens the achievability bound by using a Markovian

  Presence of Error","Published in Proceedings of CogSci 2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intuitively, human readers cope easily with errors in text; typos,
misspelling, word substitutions, etc. do not unduly disrupt natural reading.
Previous work indicates that letter transpositions result in increased reading
times, but it is unclear if this effect generalizes to more natural errors. In
this paper, we report an eye-tracking study that compares two error types
(letter transpositions and naturally occurring misspelling) and two error rates
(10% or 50% of all words contain errors). We find that human readers show
unimpaired comprehension in spite of these errors, but error words cause more
reading difficulty than correct words. Also, transpositions are more difficult
than misspellings, and a high error rate increases difficulty for all words,
including correct ones. We then present a computational model that uses
character-based (rather than traditional word-based) surprisal to account for
these results. The model explains that transpositions are harder than
misspellings because they contain unexpected letter combinations. It also
explains the error rate effect: upcoming words are more difficultto predict
when the context is degraded, leading to increased surprisal.

requires computation of both longitudinal (brake and throttle) and lateral
(steering wheel) control inputs. Unfortunately, solving the resulting nonlinear
optimal control problem is typically computationally expensive and infeasible
for real-time trajectory planning. This paper presents an iterative algorithm
that divides the path generation task into two sequential subproblems that are
significantly easier to solve. Given an initial path through the race track,
the algorithm runs a forward-backward integration scheme to determine the
minimum-time longitudinal speed profile, subject to tire friction constraints.
With this fixed speed profile, the algorithm updates the vehicle's path by
solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the resulting path
curvature while staying within track boundaries and obeying affine,
time-varying vehicle dynamics constraints. This two-step process is repeated
iteratively until the predicted lap time no longer improves. While providing no
guarantees of convergence or a globally optimal solution, the approach performs
very well when validated on the Thunderhill Raceway course in Willows, CA. The
predicted lap time converges after four to five iterations, with each iteration
over the full 4.5 km race course requiring only thirty seconds of computation
time on a laptop computer. The resulting trajectory is experimentally driven at
the race circuit with an autonomous Audi TTS test vehicle, and the resulting
lap time and racing line is comparable to both a nonlinear gradient descent
solution and a trajectory recorded from a professional racecar driver. The
experimental results indicate that the proposed method is a viable option for
online trajectory planning in the near future.

considers iterative learning control for a previously unexplored field:
autonomous racing. Racecars are driven multiple laps around the same sequence
of turns while operating near the physical limits of tire-road friction, where
steering dynamics become highly nonlinear and transient, making accurate path
tracking difficult. However, because the vehicle trajectory is identical for
each lap in the case of single-car racing, the nonlinear vehicle dynamics and
unmodelled road conditions are repeatable and can be accounted for using
iterative learning control, provided the tire force limits have not been
exceeded. This paper describes the design and application of
proportional-derivative (PD) and quadratically optimal (Q-ILC) learning
algorithms for multiple-lap path tracking of an autonomous race vehicle.
Simulation results are used to tune controller gains and test convergence, and
experimental results are presented on an Audi TTS race vehicle driving several

known as drones, have gained a lot of attention, and are rapidly becoming
ubiquitous because of their diverse applications such as surveillance, disaster
management, pollution monitoring, film-making, and military reconnaissance.
However, incidents such as fatal system failures, malicious attacks, and
disastrous misuses have raised concerns in the recent past. Security and
viability concerns in drone-based applications are growing at an alarming rate.
Besides, UAV networks (UAVNets) are distinctive from other ad-hoc networks.
Therefore, it is necessary to address these issues to ensure proper functioning
of these UAVs while keeping their uniqueness in mind. Furthermore, adequate
security and functionality require the consideration of many parameters that
may include an accurate cognizance of the working mechanism of vehicles,
geographical and weather conditions, and UAVNet communication. This is
achievable by creating a simulator that includes these aspects. A performance
evaluation through relevant drone simulator becomes indispensable procedure to
test features, configurations, and designs to demonstrate superiority to
comparative schemes and suitability. Thus, it becomes of paramount importance
to establish the credibility of simulation results by investigating the merits
and limitations of each simulator prior to selection. Based on this motivation,
we present a comprehensive survey of current drone simulators. In addition,
open research issues and research challenges are discussed and presented.

learning, in settings such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),
adversarial training and multi-agent reinforcement learning. As most of these
applications involve continuous nonconvex-nonconcave formulations, a very basic
question arises---""what is a proper definition of local optima?""
  Most previous work answers this question using classical notions of
equilibria from simultaneous games, where the min-player and the max-player act
simultaneously. In contrast, most applications in machine learning, including
GANs and adversarial training, correspond to sequential games, where the order
of which player acts first is crucial (since minimax is in general not equal to
maximin due to the nonconvex-nonconcave nature of the problems). The main
contribution of this paper is to propose a proper mathematical definition of
local optimality for this sequential setting---local minimax, as well as to
present its properties and existence results. Finally, we establish a strong
connection to a basic local search algorithm---gradient descent ascent (GDA):
under mild conditions, all stable limit points of GDA are exactly local minimax
points up to some degenerate points.

morphological evolution of Golgi stack. Golgi stack consists of multiple layers
of cisternae. It is an organelle in the biological cells. Inspired by the
Helfrich Model \cite{Helfrich}, which is a model for vesicles typically applied
to biological cells, a new model specially designed for Golgi stack is
developed and then implemented using FEM in this thesis.
  In the Golgi model, each cisternae of the Golgi stack is viewed as a closed
vesicle without topological changes, and our model is adaptable to both
single-vesicle case and multiple-vesicle case. The main idea of the math model
is to minimize the elastic energy(bending energy) of the vesicles, with some
constraints designed regarding the biological properties of Golgi stack. With
these constraints attached to the math model, we could extend this model to an
obstacle-type problem. Hence, in the thesis, not only the simulations of Golgi
stack are shown, but some interesting examples without biological meanings are
also demonstrated. Also, as multiple cisternaes are considered as a whole, this
is also a model handling multiple objects.
  A set of numerical examples is shown to compare with the observed shape of
Golgi stack, so we can lay down some possible explanations to the morphological
performance of trans-Golgi cisternae.

SIMPLE algorithm are used to solve a system of equations and the energy
gradient theory is then used to study the (associated) stability of
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The flow stability of MHD flow for different
Hartmann (Ha) number, from Ha=1 to 40, at the fixed Reynolds number, Re=190 are
investigated. The simulation is validated firstly against the simulation in
literature. The results show that, with the increasing Ha number, the
centerline velocity of the rectangular duct with MHD flow decreases and the
absolute value of the gradient of total mechanical energy along the streamwise
direction increases. The maximum of K appears near the wall in both coordinate
axis of the duct. According to the energy gradient theory, this position of the
maximum of K would initiate flow instability (if any) than the other positions.
The higher the Hartmann number is, the smaller the K value becomes, which means
that the fluid becomes more stable in the presence of higher magnetic force. As
the Hartmann number increases, the K value in the parallel layer decreases more
significantly than in the Hartmann layer. The most dangerous position of
instability tends to migrate towards wall of the duct as the Hartmann number
increases. Thus, with the energy gradient theory, the stability or instability
in the rectangular duct can be controlled by modulating the magnetic force.

well the hypothesis learned from training data generalizes to previously unseen
data. Proving tight generalization error bounds is a central question in
statistical learning theory. In this paper, we obtain generalization error
bounds for learning general non-convex objectives, which has attracted
significant attention in recent years. We develop a new framework, termed
Bayes-Stability, for proving algorithm-dependent generalization error bounds.
The new framework combines ideas from both the PAC-Bayesian theory and the
notion of algorithmic stability. Applying the Bayes-Stability method, we obtain
new data-dependent generalization bounds for stochastic gradient Langevin
dynamics (SGLD) and several other noisy gradient methods (e.g., with momentum,
mini-batch and acceleration, Entropy-SGD). Our result recovers (and is
typically tighter than) a recent result in Mou et al. (2018) and improves upon
the results in Pensia et al. (2018). Our experiments demonstrate that our
data-dependent bounds can distinguish randomly labelled data from normal data,
which provides an explanation to the intriguing phenomena observed in Zhang et
al. (2017a). We also study the setting where the total loss is the sum of a
bounded loss and an additional \ell_2 regularization term. We obtain new
generalization bounds for the continuous Langevin dynamic in this setting by
developing a new Log-Sobolev inequality for the parameter distribution at any
time. Our new bounds are more desirable when the noisy level of the process is
not small, and do not become vacuous even when T tends to infinity.

window over a data stream is a natural way of detecting changes in the system.
The drawback is that computing AUC in a sliding window is expensive, especially
if the window size is large and the data flow is significant.
  In this paper we propose a scheme for maintaining an approximate AUC in a
sliding window of length $k$. More specifically, we propose an algorithm that,
given $\epsilon$, estimates AUC within $\epsilon / 2$, and can maintain this
estimate in $O((\log k) / \epsilon)$ time, per update, as the window slides.
This provides a speed-up over the exact computation of AUC, which requires
$O(k)$ time, per update. The speed-up becomes more significant as the size of
the window increases. Our estimate is based on grouping the data points
together, and using these groups to calculate AUC. The grouping is designed
carefully such that ($i$) the groups are small enough, so that the error stays
small, ($ii$) the number of groups is small, so that enumerating them is not
expensive, and ($iii$) the definition is flexible enough so that we can
maintain the groups efficiently.
  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the average approximation error
in practice is much smaller than the approximation guarantee $\epsilon / 2$,
and that we can achieve significant speed-ups with only a modest sacrifice in
accuracy.

convolution layer is applied to a cluster of time series to extract short-term
features in neighboring areas. The output of convolution layer is concatenated
by trends and followed by convolution-LSTM layer to capture long-term patterns
in larger regional areas. To make a robust prediction when faced with missing
data, an unsupervised pretrained denoising autoencoder reconstructs the output
of the model in a fine-tuning step. The experimental results illustrate the

key idea is to jointly design the physical layer optimization-based beamforming

Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based scheme (performed at the user terminals), so
that a highly complex multi-user, cross-layer, time-varying video streaming

observe each other's behavior. However, it is not always clear how the human
and robot should interpret these actions: a given interaction might mean
several different things. Within today's state-of-the-art, the robot assigns a
single interaction strategy to the human, and learns from or teaches the human
according to this fixed strategy. Instead, we here recognize that different
users interact in different ways, and so one size does not fit all. Therefore,
we argue that the robot should maintain a distribution over the possible human
interaction strategies, and then infer how each individual end-user interacts

uncertain about the human's interaction strategy, and derive solutions to both
problems using Bayesian inference. In examples and a benchmark simulation, we

learning. Kernel quadrature is a kernel-based numerical integration scheme
developed for fast approximation of expectations $\int f(x) d p(x)$. In this
study, regarding the weight $\mu$ as a signed (or complex/vector-valued)

rate $O(e^{-p})$ with parameter number $p$, which is faster than the
traditional Barron's rate, and a fast estimation rate $\widetilde{O}(1/n)$ with

empirical risk minimization, we can understand that the complexity measure also

the following criteria: (1) the parameterization is a bijective map; and (2)
the map has lowest possible distortion. However, none of the state-of-the-art
volumetric parameterization methods has fully addressed the above issues. In
this paper, we propose a three-stage approach for constructing volumetric
parameterization satisfying the above criteria. Firstly, a harmonic map is
computed between a unit cube and the computational domain. Then a bijective map
modeled by a max-min optimization problem is computed in a coarse-to-fine way,
and an algorithm based on divide and conquer strategy is proposed to solve the
optimization problem efficiently. Finally, to ensure high quality of the
parameterization, the MIPS (Most Isometric Parameterizations) method is adopted
to reduce the conformal distortion of the bijective map. We provide several
examples to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and to compare our
approach with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our

deconvolution is considered. Given observations of a random sample from a
distribution $P_0\equiv P_{F_0}$ indexed by a (potentially
infinite-dimensional) parameter $F_0$, which is the distribution of the latent
variable in a standard additive Laplace measurement error model, one wants to
estimate a linear functional of $F_0$. Asymptotically efficient maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) of integral linear functionals of the mixing
distribution $F_0$ in a convolution model with the Laplace kernel density is
investigated. Situations are distinguished in which the functional of interest
can be consistently estimated at $n^{-1/2}$-rate by the plug-in MLE, which is
asymptotically normal and efficient, in the sense of achieving the variance
lower bound, from those in which no integral linear functional can be estimated
at parametric rate, which precludes any possibility for asymptotic efficiency.
The $\sqrt{n}$-convergence of the MLE, valid in the case of a degenerate mixing
distribution at a single location point, fails in general, as does asymptotic
normality. It is shown that there exists no regular estimator sequence for
integral linear functionals of the mixing distribution that, when recentered
about the estimand and $\sqrt{n}$-rescaled, is asymptotically efficient,
\emph{viz}., has Gaussian limit distribution with minimum variance. One can
thus only expect estimation with some slower rate and, often, with a
non-Gaussian limit distribution.

analysis of how opinions evolve as a function of interpersonal relationships.
It is also of great interest to model and understand the implications of
friendly and antagonistic relationships. In this paper, we propose a new,
simple and intuitive model that incorporates the socio-psychological phenomenon
of the boomerang effect in opinion dynamics. We establish that, under certain
conditions on the structure of the signed network that corresponds to the
so-called structural balance property, the opinions in the network polarize.
Compared to other models in the literature, our model displays a richer and
perhaps more intuitive behavior of the opinions when the social network does
not satisfy structural balance. In particular, we analyze signed networks in
which the opinions show persistent fluctuations (including the case of the
so-called clustering balance).

resource and environment. Use of these dimensions in a controlled way and their
effective scheduling brings the project success. Project scheduling process
includes defining project activities, and estimation of time and resources to
be used for the activities. At this point, the project resource-scheduling
problems have begun to attract more attention after Program Evaluation and
Review Technique (PERT) and Critical Path Method (CPM) are developed one after
the other. However, complexity and difficulty of CPM and PERT processes led to
the use of these techniques through artificial intelligence methods such as
Genetic Algorithm (GA). In this study, an algorithm was proposed and developed,
which determines critical path, critical activities and project completion
duration by using GA, instead of CPM and PERT techniques used for network
analysis within the scope of project management. The purpose of using GA was
that these algorithms are an effective method for solution of complex
optimization problems. Therefore, correct decisions can be made for implemented
project activities by using obtained results. Thus, optimum results were
obtained in a shorter time than the CPM and PERT techniques by using the model
based on the dynamic algorithm. It is expected that this study will contribute
to the performance field (time, speed, low error etc.) of other studies.

  In this paper, we introduce two new techniques: Fine-Grained Checkpointing,

system failure, and In-Cache-Line Logging, an undo-logging technique that
enables recovery of earlier state without requiring cache-line flushes in the

important for dilute phases. Monte Carlo simulations of the statistical
behavior of the membrane-interacting colloids account semi-quantitatively,

significant challenges to both theory and experiment. We report a combined

nitride (BN). The simulation methodologies include path integral Monte Carlo
(PIMC), several density functional theory (DFT) molecular dynamics methods
[plane-wave pseudopotential, Fermi operator expansion (FOE), and spectral
quadrature (SQ)], activity expansion (ACTEX), and all-electron Green's function
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (MECCA), and compute the pressure and internal energy of
BN over a broad range of densities ($\rho$) and temperatures ($T$). Our
experiments were conducted at the Omega laser facility and measured the
Hugoniot of BN to unprecedented pressures (12--30 Mbar). The EOSs computed
using different methods cross validate one another, and the experimental
Hugoniot are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions. We assess that
the largest discrepancies between theoretical predictions are $<$4% in pressure
and $<$3% in energy and occur at $10^6$ K. We find remarkable consistency
between the EOS from DFT calculations performed on different platforms and
using different exchange-correlation functionals and those from PIMC using
free-particle nodes. This provides strong evidence for the accuracy of both
PIMC and DFT in the warm-dense regime. Moreover, SQ and FOE data have
significantly smaller error bars than PIMC, and so represent significant
advances for efficient computation at high $T$. We also construct tabular EOS
models and clarify the ionic and electronic structure of BN over a broad
$T-\rho$ range and quantify their roles in the EOS. The tabular models may be
utilized for future simulations of laser-driven experiments that include BN as
a candidate ablator material.

encoder and a reconstructor for the task of album storytelling. The photo-scene
encoder contains two sub-encoders, namely the photo and scene encoders, which
are stacked together and behave hierarchically to fully exploit the structure
information of the photos within an album. Specifically, the photo encoder
generates semantic representation for each photo while exploiting temporal
relationships among them. The scene encoder, relying on the obtained photo
representations, is responsible for detecting the scene changes and generating
scene representations. Subsequently, the decoder dynamically and attentively
summarizes the encoded photo and scene representations to generate a sequence
of album representations, based on which a story consisting of multiple
coherent sentences is generated. In order to fully extract the useful semantic
information from an album, a reconstructor is employed to reproduce the
summarized album representations based on the hidden states of the decoder. The
proposed model can be trained in an end-to-end manner, which results in an
improved performance over the state-of-the-arts on the public visual
storytelling (VIST) dataset. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical photo-scene encoder and

encapsulation layer thickness as a consequence of the Purcell effect. The
time-resolved photoluminescence measurements together with cw reflectivity and
photoluminescence experiments show that the neutral exciton spontaneous
emission time can be tuned by one order of magnitude depending on the thickness
of the surrounding hBN layers. The inhibition of the radiative recombination
can yield spontaneous emission time up to $10$~ps. These results are in very
good agreement with the calculated recombination rate in the weak
exciton-photon coupling regime. The analysis shows that we are also able to
observe a sizeable enhancement of the exciton radiative decay rate.
Understanding the role of these electrodynamical effects allow us to elucidate
the complex dynamics of relaxation and recombination for both neutral and

represent the sentences of a corpus as the nodes of a graph or a hypergraph in

popular node ranking algorithms, and a summary is produced by extracting highly
scored sentences. This approach fails to select a subset of jointly relevant
sentences and it may produce redundant summaries that are missing important
topics of the corpus. To alleviate this issue, a new hypergraph-based
summarizer is proposed in this paper, in which each node is a sentence and each
hyperedge is a theme, namely a group of sentences sharing a topic. Themes are
weighted in terms of their prominence in the corpus and their relevance to a
user-defined query. It is further shown that the problem of identifying a
subset of sentences covering the relevant themes of the corpus is equivalent to
that of finding a hypergraph transversal in our theme-based hypergraph. Two
extensions of the notion of hypergraph transversal are proposed for the purpose
of summarization, and polynomial time algorithms building on the theory of
submodular functions are proposed for solving the associated discrete
optimization problems. The worst-case time complexity of the proposed
algorithms is squared in the number of terms, which makes it cheaper than the
existing hypergraph-based methods. A thorough comparative analysis with related

strongly influenced by internal states. Estimating the structure of these
internal states is crucial for understanding the neural basis of behavior. In
principle, internal states can be estimated by inverting behavior models, as in
inverse model-based Reinforcement Learning. However, this requires careful
parameterization and risks model-mismatch to the animal. Here we take a
data-driven approach to infer latent states directly from observations of
behavior, using a partially observable switching semi-Markov process. This
process has two elements critical for capturing animal behavior: it captures
non-exponential distribution of times between observations, and transitions
between latent states depend on the animal's actions, features that require
more complex non-markovian models to represent. To demonstrate the utility of
our approach, we apply it to the observations of a simulated optimal agent
performing a foraging task, and find that latent dynamics extracted by the
model has correspondences with the belief dynamics of the agent. Finally, we
apply our model to identify latent states in the behaviors of monkey performing
a foraging task, and find clusters of latent states that identify periods of
time consistent with expectant waiting. This data-driven behavioral model will
be valuable for inferring latent cognitive states, and thereby for measuring
neural representations of those states.

the adversary's sequence of losses. In this framework, Russo and Van Roy
proposed an information-theoretic analysis of Thompson Sampling based on the
information ratio, resulting in optimal worst-case regret bounds. In this paper
we introduce three novel ideas to this line of work. First we propose a new
quantity, the scale-sensitive information ratio, which allows us to obtain more
refined first-order regret bounds (i.e., bounds of the form $\sqrt{L^*}$ where
$L^*$ is the loss of the best combinatorial action). Second we replace the
entropy over combinatorial actions by a coordinate entropy, which allows us to
obtain the first optimal worst-case bound for Thompson Sampling in the
combinatorial setting. Finally, we introduce a novel link between Bayesian
agents and frequentist confidence intervals. Combining these ideas we show that
the classical multi-armed bandit first-order regret bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d
L^*})$ still holds true in the more challenging and more general semi-bandit
scenario. This latter result improves the previous state of the art bound
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(d+m^3)L^*})$ by Lykouris, Sridharan and Tardos.
  Moreover we sharpen these results with two technical ingredients. The first
leverages a recent insight of Zimmert and Lattimore to replace Shannon entropy
with more refined potential functions in the analysis. The second is a
\emph{Thresholded} Thompson sampling algorithm, which slightly modifies the
original algorithm by never playing low-probability actions. This thresholding
results in fully $T$-independent regret bounds when $L^*$ is almost surely
upper-bounded, which we show does not hold for ordinary Thompson sampling.

element of the set. A fundamental result of Wilson is that for all $n=|V(G)|$
sufficiently large, $G$ has a $k$-decomposition if and only if $G$ is
$k$-divisible.
  Let ${\bf v} \in {\mathbb R}^{|F_k|}$ be indexed by $F_k$. For a

relaxations, one obtains the (polynomial time computable) fractional analogue

  We use these results to obtain new and improved bounds on several
decomposition results. For example, we prove that every $n$-vertex tournament
which is $3$-divisible has a triangle decomposition in which the number of
directed triangles is less than $0.0222n^2(1+o(1))$ and that every

accretion events. When the SMBHs are accreting, they form dual or binary AGN
and can give rise to double-peaked emission lines in the optical spectra of the
merger remnant. The double-peaked emission lines could also be due to jet-ISM
interaction or rotating disks. One of the best ways to confirm dual/binary AGN
in double-peaked AGN (DPAGN) is by using high resolution radio observations. We
have observed a sample of 20 DPAGN at two or more frequencies using the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), of which one source is already published and the
remaining 19 are presented in this paper. We have detected dual radio
structures at separation of $\lesssim$ 10 kpc in three of our sample galaxies.
Using the spectral index maps and optical spectra of the sources, we have
confirmed that one of them is a dual AGN (DAGN), while the other two can be
dual AGN or AGN+ star-forming nuclei pairs. Of the remaining sources, one has a
clear core-jet structure and another source could be a core-jet structure or a
DAGN. The remaining 13 sources are single cores while one source is not
detected at any frequency. We find that for our dual AGN detection, the DPAGN
emission lines do not originate from the dual/binary AGN. Instead, they could
be due to outflows or jets. Hence, we conclude that DPAGN identified in low
resolution SDSS spectra are not good indicators of dual/binary AGN. On the
other hand, closely interacting galaxies or merger remnants are good candidates
for detecting dual/binary AGN.

solved by computing the evolution of the total credit spread over time.
Moreover, the covariance between countries' total spread allows understand any

The governing equations are the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and
solved by the finite volume method (FVM). The ratio of the center-to-center

to investigate the effect of rotational speed and Reynolds number on the

is analyzed by using the energy gradient theory, which produces the energy
gradient function K to identify the region where the flow is the most prone to
be destabilized and the degree of the destabilization. Numerical results reveal
that K is the most significant at the separated shear layers of the cylinder
pair. With Re increases, the length of the wake is shorter and the vortex
shedding generally exhibits a symmetrical distribution for theta_i <theta_crit.
It is also shown that the unsteady vortex shedding can be suppressed by

inevitable for removing the scene content that heavily obscures the camera
model fingerprints. Unlike the conventional approaches where fixed filters are
used for preprocessing, the proposed remnant blocks, when coupled with a

learn to suppress the unnecessary image contents dynamically. This helps the
classification block extract more robust camera model-specific features for CMI
from the remnant of the image. The whole network, called RemNet, consisting of
a preprocessing block and a shallow classification block, when trained on 18
models from the Dresden database, shows 100% accuracy for 16 camera models with
an overall accuracy of 97.59% on test images from unseen devices, outperforming
the state of the art deep CNNs used in CMI. Furthermore, the proposed remnant
blocks, when cascaded with the existing deep CNNs, e.g., ResNet, DenseNet,
boost their performances by a large margin. The proposed approach proves to be
very robust in identifying the source camera models, even if the original

the surge in eruption rates increased $5$-$30$ fold from the steady-state rates
during the last deglaciation, they cannot account for large variations of Rare
Earth Element (REE) concentrations in the Icelandic lavas. Lavas erupted during
the last deglaciation are depleted in REEs by up to $70\%$; whereas, existing
models, which assume instantaneous melt transport, can only produce at most
$20\%$ depletion. Here, we develop a numerical model with finite melt ascent
velocity and show that the variations of REEs are strongly dependent on the
melt ascent velocity. When the average melt ascent velocity is $100$
$\mathrm{m/yr}$, the variation of $\mathrm{La}$ calculated by our model is
comparable to that of the observations. In contrast, when the melt ascent
velocity is $1,000$ $\mathrm{m/yr}$ or above, the model variation of
$\mathrm{La}$ becomes significantly lower than observed, which explains why
previous models with instantaneous melt transport did not reproduce the large
variations. We provide the first model that takes account of the diachronous
response of volcanism to deglaciation. We show by comparing our model
calculations of the relative volumes of different eruption types (subglacial,
finiglacial and postglacial) and the timing of the bursts in volcanic eruptions
with the observations across different volcanic zones that the Icelandic
average melt ascent velocity during the last deglaciation is likely to be

three invariants in $E$ with each of them containing the locally algebraic

family that embeds into the associated Hecke-isotypic subspace in the completed

representations depending on four invariants and proved a similar result of
local-global compatibility. We prove that if a representation $\Pi$ in Breuil's
family embeds into the completed cohomology, then it must equally embed into an
object in our family determined by $\Pi$. This gives a purely representation
theoretic necessary condition for $\Pi$ to embed into completed cohomology.

we show that the convergence is {\it uniform} with respect to the surplus. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first rate of convergence achieved for
these ruin probabilities, and we show that it is the tightest one in the
general case. For the case of exponentially-distributed claims, we are able to
improve the approximation arising from the diffusion, attaining a uniform
$\mO\big(n^{-k/2}\big)$ rate of convergence for arbitrary $k \in \N$. We also
include two examples that illustrate our results.

demonstrate why approximate covariance matrices bias physical constraints, and

evolution of complex networks. These advances were initially driven by
information-poor empirical networks and theoretical analysis of unweighted and
undirected graphs. Recently, information-rich empirical data complex networks
supported the development of more sophisticated models that include edge
directionality and weight properties, and multiple layers. Many studies still
focus on unweighted undirected description of networks, prompting an essential
question: how to identify when a model is simpler than it must be? Here, we
argue that the presence of centrality anomalies in complex networks is a result
of model over-simplification. Specifically, we investigate the well-known
anomaly in betweenness centrality for transportation networks, according to
which highly connected nodes are not necessarily the most central. Using a
broad class of network models with weights and spatial constraints and four
large data sets of transportation networks, we show that the unweighted
projection of the structure of these networks can exhibit a significant
fraction of anomalous nodes compared to a random null model. However, the
weighted projection of these networks, compared with an appropriated null
model, significantly reduces the fraction of anomalies observed, suggesting
that centrality anomalies are a symptom of model over-simplification. Because
lack of information-rich data is a common challenge when dealing with complex
networks and can cause anomalies that misestimate the role of nodes in the
system, we argue that sufficiently sophisticated models be used when anomalies
are detected.

in environments alongside humans to achieve a task. A typical use is to extend
or amplify the capabilities of a human in cognitive or physical ways, requiring
the machine to adapt to the users' intentions and preferences. Often, this
takes the form of a human operator providing some type of feedback to the user,
which can be explicit feedback, implicit feedback, or a combination of both.
Explicit feedback, such as through a mouse click, carries a high cognitive
load. The focus of this study is to extend the current state of the art in
interactive machine learning by demonstrating that agents can learn a human
user's behavior and adapt to preferences with a reduced amount of explicit
human feedback in a mixed feedback setting. The learning agent perceives a
value of its own behavior from hand gestures given via a spatial interface.
This feedback mechanism is termed Spatial Interface Valuing. This method is
evaluated experimentally in a simulated environment for a grasping task using a
robotic arm with variable grip settings. Preliminary results indicate that
learning agents using spatial interface valuing can learn a value function
mapping spatial gestures to expected future rewards much more quickly as
compared to those same agents just receiving explicit feedback, demonstrating
that an agent perceiving feedback from a human user via a spatial interface can
serve as an effective complement to existing approaches.

continuum and CO isotopologue observations we study the HD 100453 AB system
with a spatial resolution of 0.09"" x 0.17"" at 234 GHz. We use SPH simulations
and orbital fitting to investigate the tidal influence of the companion on the

between 0.22"" and 0.40"" with an inclination of 29.5 deg. and a position angle
of 151.0 deg., an unresolved inner disk, and excess mm emission cospatial with
the northern spiral arm which was previously detected using scattered light
observations. We also detect CO emission from 7 au (well within the disk
cavity) out to 1.10"", i.e., overlapping with HD 100453 B at least in
projection. The outer CO disk PA and inclination differ by up to 10 deg. from
the values found for the inner CO disk and the dust continuum emission, which
we interpret as due to gravitational interaction with HD 100453 B. Both the
spatial extent of the CO disk and the detection of mm emission at the same
location as the northern spiral arm are in disagreement with the previously
proposed near co-planar orbit of HD 100453 B. Conclusions: We conclude that HD
100453 B has an orbit that is significantly misaligned with the circumprimary
disk. Because it is unclear whether such an orbit can explain the observed
system geometry we highlight an alternative scenario that explains all detected
disk features where another, (yet) undetected, low mass close companion within
the disk cavity, shepherds a misaligned inner disk whose slowly precessing
shadows excite the spiral arms.

$Z(R)\propto[\Sigma_I(R)]^{-1/3}$, if their amplitudes are comparable to the
disk thickness, where $\Sigma_I$ is the surface density of the disk (integrated
over its whole vertical range). Moreover, the usual adiabatic approximation
gives a good description of the orbits' envelopes for low vertical amplitudes.
However, these two approaches are apparently disconnected, since their
expressions differ qualitatively. Our purpose in this paper is to fill this gap
by extending these previous formulae to regular orbits with arbitrary vertical
amplitudes inside the disk. We compare existing $Z(R)$ estimates: the
razor-thin disk case, the adiabatic approximation (low-amplitude orbits in
three-dimensional disks), and the integrated surface-density estimate
(high-amplitude orbits in three-dimensional disks) in order to establish a
connection between them. The formula presented here links the aforementioned
results in an elegant and continuous way, being valid for vertical amplitudes
throughout the whole vertical extension of the disk and with an expression
which has the same form for all regimes. The advantage of the present formalism
is the dependence of $Z(R)$ only on observable quantities, namely the disk's
vertically integrated surface density, without the need to obtain the
gravitational potential for the system.

The equation that describes the untreated tumor growth is based on

successfully exponential, Gompertz, logistic, and power-law tumor growths. We
have been able to include as many hallmarks of cancer as possible. We study
also the dynamic response of cancer under therapy. Using our model, we can make
predictions about the different outcomes when we change the parameters, and/or
the initial conditions. We can determine the importance of different factors to
influence tumor growth. We discover synergistic therapeutic effects of
different treatments and drugs. Cancer is generally untreatable using
conventional monotherapy. We consider conventional therapies, oncogene-targeted
therapies, tumor-suppressors gene-targeted therapies, immunotherapies,
anti-angiogenesis therapies, virotherapy, among others. We need therapies with
the potential to target both tumor cells and the tumors' microenvironment.
Drugs that target oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes can be effective in the
treatment of some cancers. However, most tumors do reoccur. We have found that
the success of the new therapeutic agents can be seen when used in combination
with other cancer-cell-killing therapies. Our results have allowed us to design
a combinational therapy that can lead to the complete eradication of cancer.

transforming it into a simple comparison operation. This is unlike existing
methods, which are forced to the retain the conventional floating-point-based
batch normalization. Our binary networks, apart from displaying advantages of

based on the concept of a ""distinction graph"": a graph in which two nodes are
connected iff they cannot be distinguished by a particular observer. The
""graphtropy"" of a distinction graph is defined as the average connection
probability of two nodes; in the case where the distinction graph is a composed
of disconnected components that are fully connected subgraphs, this is
equivalent to Ellerman's logical entropy, which has straightforward
relationships to Shannon entropy. Probabilistic distinction graphs and
probabilistic graphtropy are also considered, as well as connections between
graphtropy and thermodynamic and quantum entropy. The semantics of the Second
Law of Thermodynamics and the Maximum Entropy Production Principle are unfolded
in a novel way, via analysis of the cognitive processes underlying the making
of distinction graphs This evokes an interpretation in which complex
intelligence is seen to correspond to states of consciousness with intermediate
graphtropy, which are associated with memory imperfections that violate the
assumptions leading to derivation of the Second Law. In the case where nodes of
a distinction graph are labeled by computable entities, graphtropy is shown to
be monotonically related to the average algorithmic information of the nodes
(relative to to the algorithmic information of the observer). A
quantum-mechanical version of distinction graphs is considered, in which
distinctions can exist in a superposed state; this yields to graphtropy as a
measure of the impurity of a mixed state, and to a concept of ""quangraphtropy.""

is formulated, via enhancing distinction graphs with additional links

quantization of entropy and horizon area of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black hole is
carried out. The same entropy spectrum is obtained in two different coordinate
systems. It is also observed that the spacing of the entropy spectrum is
independent of the black hole parameters and also the corresponding quantum of
horizon area is in agreement with the results of Bekenstein.

educational units (EUs). Many of these syllabi are based, in one way or the
other, on the syllabi provided by the International Requirements Engineering
Board (IREB), a non-profit organisation devoted to standardised certification
programs for RE. IREB syllabi are developed by RE experts and are, thus, based
on the assumption that they address topics of practical relevance. However,
little is known about to what extent practitioners actually perceive those
contents as useful. We have started a study to investigate the relevance of the
EUs included in the IREB Foundation Level certification programme. In a first
phase reported in this paper, we have surveyed practitioners mainly from DACH
countries (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) participating in the IREB
certification. Later phases will widen the scope both by including other
countries and by not requiring IREB-certified participants. The results shall
foster a critical reflection on the practical relevance of EUs built upon the
de-facto standard syllabus of IREB.

classical electromagnetic field, can alternatively be interpreted as giving the
dynamics for the photon's quantum wave function. I explain why this quantum
interpretation would only be viable if the electromagnetic field were
sufficiently weak, then motivate a particular approach to introducing a wave
function for the photon (following Good, 1957). This wave function ultimately
turns out to be unsatisfactory because the probabilities derived from it do not
always transform properly under Lorentz transformations. The fact that such a
quantum interpretation of Maxwell's equations is unsatisfactory suggests that
the electromagnetic field is more fundamental than the photon.

to word sequences are an appealing approach to end-to-end automatic speech
recognition due to their simplicity. However, prior works have shown that
modelling A2W typically encounters issues of data sparsity that prevent
training such a model directly. So far, pre-training initialization is the only
approach proposed to deal with this issue. In this work, we propose to build a
shared neural network and optimize A2W and conventional hybrid models in a
multi-task manner. Our results show that training an A2W model is much more
stable with our multi-task model without pre-training initialization, and
results in a significant improvement compared to a baseline model. Experiments
also reveal that the performance of a hybrid acoustic model can be further
improved when jointly training with a sequence-level optimization criterion
such as acoustic-to-word.

Comparing it with squared Dirac-Fock-Ivanenko equation we have derived
expression for gravitationally induced chiral current. Starting from the
expression for gravitationally induced chiral current obtained on the basis of
brane symmetry we have shown that being placed into the Einstein's
gravitational field, chiral current yields inertial gravitational field. This
inertial gravitational field transforms into the vortex gravitational field and
then back to the inertial gravitational field thus ensuring the propagation of
such kind of gravitational excitation as constitutional part of gravitational
wave. In the case of weak gravitation, these symmetry considerations and our
consequent equations lead directly to harmonic gauge conditions that are
necessary for supplementing Einstein equations.

for predictive modeling and subsequent decision support. While the focus has
hitherto been placed on areas with high population density, we address the
challenging undertaking of predicting crime hotspots in regions with low
population densities and highly unequally-distributed crime.This results in a
severe sparsity (i.e., class imbalance) of the outcome variable, which impedes
predictive modeling. To alleviate this, we develop machine learning models for
spatio-temporal prediction that are specifically adjusted for an imbalanced
distribution of the class labels and test them in an actual setting with
state-of-the-art predictors (i.e., socio-economic, geographical, temporal,
meteorological, and crime variables in fine resolution). The proposed
imbalance-aware hyper-ensemble increases the hit ratio considerably from 18.1%
to 24.6% when aiming for the top 5% of hotspots, and from 53.1% to 60.4% when
aiming for the top 20% of hotspots.

question of ""GIS and Big Data"". Much of the discussion has been about the data:
huge volumes of 2D and 3D spatial data and spatio-temporal data are now being
collected and stored; so how they can be accessed? and how can we map and
interpret massive datasets in an effective manner? Less attention has been paid
to questions regarding the analysis of Big Data, although this has risen up the
agenda in recent times. Examples include the use of density analysis to
represent map request events, with Esri demonstrating that (given sufficient
resources) they can process and analyze large numbers of data point events
using kernel density techniques within a very short timeframe (under a minute);
data filtering (to extract subsets of data that are of particular interest);
and data mining (broader than simple filtering). For real-time data, sequential
analysis has also been successfully applied; in this case the data are received
as a stream and are used to build up a dynamic map or to cumulatively generate
statistical values that may be mapped and/or used to trigger events or alarms.
To this extent the analysis is similar to that conducted on smaller datasets,
but with data and processing architectures that are specifically designed to
cope with the data volumes involved and with a focus on data exploration as a
key mechanism for discovery. Miller and Goodchild (2014) have argued that
considerable care is required when working with Big Data significant issues
arise from each of the ""four Vs of Big Data"": the sheer Volume of data; the
Velocity of data arrival; the Variety of forms of data and their origins; and
the Veracity of such data. As such, geospatial research has had to adapt to
harness new forms of data to validly represent real-world phenomena.
