is a topic of considerable interest for basic science and thermal management
technologies. Although the failure of Fourier's law beyond the diffusive regime
is well understood, debate exists over the proper physical description of
thermal transport in the ballistic to diffusive crossover. Here, we derive a
generalized Fourier's law that links the heat flux and temperature fields,
valid from ballistic to diffusive regimes and for general geometries, using the
Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation.
This generalized Fourier's law predicts that thermal conductivity not only
becomes nonlocal at length scales smaller than phonon mean free paths, but also
requires the inclusion of an inhomogeneous nonlocal source term that has been
previously neglected. We demonstrate the validity of this generalized Fourier's
law through direct comparison with time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR)
measurements in the nondiffusive regime without adjustable parameters.
Furthermore, we show that interpreting experimental data without this
generalized Fourier's law leads to inaccurate measurement of thermal transport
properties.

contracts between an employer and an independent gig worker. We model the
worker's self-respect with an endogenous backward-looking participation
constraint; he accepts a job offer if and only if its utility is at least as
large as his reference value, which is based on the average of previously
realized wages. If the dynamically changing reference value capturing the
worker's demand is too high, then no contract is struck until the reference
value hits a threshold. Below the threshold, contracts are offered and
accepted, and the worker's wage demand follows a stochastic process. We apply
our model to perfectly competitive and monopsonistic labor market structures
and investigate first-best and second-best solutions. We show that a
far-sighted employer with market power may sacrifice instantaneous profit to
regulate the agent's demand. Moreover, the far-sighted employer implements
increasing and path-dependent effort levels. Our model captures the worker's
bargaining power by a vulnerability parameter that measures the rate at which
his wage demand decreases when unemployed. With a low vulnerability parameter,
the worker can afford to go unemployed and need not take a job at all costs.
Conversely, a worker with high vulnerability can be exploited by the employer,
and in this case our model also exhibits self-exploitation.

approach whose principal merit is to beat the point-to-point private capacity

an untrusted node. Indeed, recent security proofs of various TF-QKD type
protocols have confirmed that the secret key rate of these schemes scales
essentially as the square root of the transmittance of the channel. Here, we
focus on the TF-QKD protocol introduced by Curty et al, whose secret key rate
is nearly an order of magnitude higher than previous solutions. Its security
relies on the estimation of the detection probabilities associated to various
photon-number states through the decoy-state method. We derive analytical
bounds on these quantities assuming that each party uses either two, three or
four decoy intensity settings, and we investigate the protocol's performance in
this scenario. Our simulations show that two decoy intensity settings are
enough to beat the point-to-point private capacity of the channel, and that the
use of four decoys is already basically optimal, in the sense that it almost
reproduces the ideal scenario of infinite decoys. We also observe that the
protocol seems to be quite robust against intensity fluctuations of the optical

structure. Each agent has a finite number of states, and communication
opportunities occur nondeterministically, allowing the agents involved to
change their states based on each other's states.
  In the present paper we study unreliable models based on population protocols
and their variations from the point of view of expressive power. We model the
effects of message loss. We show that for a general definition of unreliable
protocols with constant-storage agents such protocols can only compute
predicates computable by immediate observation population protocols (sometimes
also called one-way protocols). Immediate observation population protocols are
inherently tolerant of unreliable communication and keep their expressive power
under a wide range of fairness conditions. We also prove that a large class of
message-based models that are generally more expressive than immediate
observation becomes strictly less expressive than immediate observation in the
unreliable case.

insulators in condensed mater. From geophysical fluids to active matter,

protected chiral edge modes. The number of such modes should coincide with the
bulk topological invariant (e.g. Chern number) defined for a sample without
boundary, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence. However this is not
always the case when dealing with continuous media where there is no small
scale cut-off. The number of edge modes actually depends on the boundary
condition, even when the bulk is properly regularized, showing an apparent
paradox where the bulk-edge correspondence is violated. In this paper we solve
this paradox by showing that the anomaly is due to {ghost} edge modes hidden in
the asymptotic part of the spectrum. We provide a general formalism based on
scattering theory to detect all edge modes properly, so that the bulk-edge
correspondence is restored. We illustrate this approach through the odd-viscous
shallow-water model and the massive Dirac Hamiltonian, and discuss the physical
consequences.

wireless networks. In this model, wireless nodes are represented by points in
the plane and there is an edge between two points if and only if their
Euclidean distance is at most one. A hop spanner for the UDG is a spanning
subgraph $H$ such that for every edge $(p,q)$ in the UDG the topological
shortest path between $p$ and $q$ in $H$ has a constant number of edges. The
hop stretch factor of $H$ is the maximum number of edges of these paths. A hop
spanner is plane (i.e. embedded planar) if its edges do not cross each other.
  The problem of constructing hop spanners for the UDG has received
considerable attention in both computational geometry and wireless ad hoc
networks. Despite this attention, there has not been significant progress on
getting hop spanners that (i) are plane, and (ii) have low hop stretch factor.
Previous constructions either do not ensure the planarity or have high hop
stretch factor. The only construction that satisfies both conditions is due to
Catusse, Chepoi, and Vax\`{e}s (2010); their plane hop spanner has hop stretch
factor at most 449.
  Our main result is a simple algorithm that constructs a plane hop spanner for
the UDG. In addition to the simplicity, the hop stretch factor of the
constructed spanner is at most 341. Even though the algorithm itself is simple,
its analysis is rather involved. Several results on the plane geometry are
established in the course of the proof. These results are of independent
interest.

pebbles into planetesimals. It is triggered at a particular disk location where
the local volume density of solids exceeds that of the gas. After their
formation, planetesimals can grow by feeding from other planetesimals in the
birth ring as well as by accreting inwardly drifting pebbles from the outer
disk.
  To investigate the growth of planetesimals at a single location by the
streaming instability, we test the conditions under which super-Earths are able
to form within the lifetime of the gaseous disk. We modify the \texttt{Mercury}
N-body code to trace the growth and dynamical evolution of a swarm of
planetesimals at the ice line for a solar-mass star. Three distributions of
planetesimal sizes are investigated: (i) a mono-dispersed population of 400 km
radius planetesimals, (ii) a poly-dispersed populations of planetesimals from
200 km up to 1000 km, (iii) a bimodal distribution with a single runaway body
and a swarm of smaller, 100 km size planetesimals.
  The mono-disperse population of 400 km size planetesimals cannot form
$\gtrsim$ Earth mass protoplanets. Their velocity dispersions are quickly
excited, which suppresses both planetesimal and pebble accretion. Planets can
form from the poly-dispersed and bimodal distributions. In these circumstances,
the two-component nature damps the random velocity of the large embryo by small
planetesimals' dynamical friction, allowing the embryo to accrete pebbles
efficiently when it approaches $10^{-2}$ Earth mass. We find that super-Earth
planets are preferred to form when the pebble mass flux is higher, the disk
turbulence is lower, or the Stokes number of the pebbles is higher.

study quantum transport in one dimension. Such channels are a prospective tool
for the efficient transfer of quantum information at the nanoscale, and play a
vital role in exposing intriguing physics. Electric current along the edge
carries energy and heat leading to inelastic scattering, which may impede
coherent transport. Several experiments attempting to probe the concomitant
energy redistribution along the edge reported energy loss via unknown
mechanisms of inelastic scattering. Here we employ quantum dots to inject and
extract electrons at specific energies, to spectrally analyse inelastic
scattering inside quantum Hall edge channels. We show that the ""missing energy""
puzzle can be untangled by incorporating non-local Auger-like processes, in
which energy is redistributed between spatially separate parts of the sample.
Our theoretical analysis, accounting for the experimental results, challenges
common-wisdom analyses which ignore such non-local decay channels.

propagation in saturated porous media yield smooth behavior while experiments,
field observations and a few numerical solutions reveal stepwise crack
advancement and pressure oscillations. To explain this fact, we invoke
self-organization of rupture observed in fracturing solids, both dry and fully
saturated, when two requirements are satisfied: i) the external drive has a
much slower timescale than fracture propagation; and ii) the increment of the
external load (drive) is applied only when the internal rearrangement of
fracture is over. These requirements are needed to obtain clean Self Organised
Criticality (SOC) in quasi-static situations. They imply that there should be
no restriction on the fracture velocity i.e. algorithmically the fracture
advancement rule should always be independent of the crack velocity. Generally,
this is not the case when smooth answers are obtained which are often
unphysical. Under the above conditions hints of Self Organized Criticality are
evident in heterogeneous porous media in quasi-static conditions using a
lattice model, showing stepwise advancement of the fracture and pressure
oscillations. We extend this model to incorporate inertia forces and show that
this behavior still holds. By incorporating the above requirements in numerical
fracture advancement algorithms for cohesive fracture in saturated porous
continua we also reproduce stepwise advancements and pressure oscillations both
in quasi-static and dynamic situations. Since dynamic tests of dry specimens
show that the fracture advancement velocity is not constant we replicate such
an effect with a model of a debonding beam on elastic foundation. This is the
first step before introducing the interaction with a fluid.

$\rho(x)$ satisfies $\rho(x) = \rho(0)v(0)/v(x)$, where $x = 0$ is an arbitrary
reference point. Such a dependence of steady-state $\rho(x)$ on the particle
dynamics, which was the qualitative basis of recent work demonstrating how to
`paint' with bacteria, is forbidden in thermal equilibrium. We verify this

second-order transition at densities even further away from half filling. Close

Kondo model, describing the coupling of a local moment to both a bosonic and a
fermionic bath, has been of extensive interest. For the model in the presence
of SU(2) spin rotational symmetry, questions have been raised about its phase
diagram. Here we develop a version of continuous-time Quantum Monte Carlo
(CT-QMC) method suitable for addressing this issue; this procedure can reach
sufficiently low temperatures while preserving the SU(2) symmetry. Using this
method for the Bose-Fermi Anderson model, we clarify the renormalization-group
fixed points and the phase diagram for the case with a constant fermionic-bath
density of states and a power-law bosonic-bath spectral function
$\rho_{b}(\omega) \propto \omega^{s}$ ($0<s<1$). We find two types of Kondo
destruction QCP, depending on the power-law exponent $s$ in the bosonic bath
spectrum. For $s^{*}<s<1$, both types of QCPs exist and, in the parameter
regime accessible by an analytical $\epsilon$-expansion renormalization-group
calculation (here $\epsilon=1-s$), the CT-QMC result is fully consistent with
prior predictions by the latter method. For $s<s^{*}$, there is only one type
of QCP. At both type of Kondo destruction QCPs, we find that the exponent of
the local spin susceptibility $\eta$ obeys the relation $\eta=\epsilon$, which
has important implications for Kondo destruction QCP in the Kondo lattice

making it difficult to know if the information bound is singular or not. In
either case, we propose a penalized sieve generalized empirical likelihood
(GEL) estimation and inference procedure, which is based on the unconditional
WAD moment restriction and an increasing number of unconditional moments that
are implied by the conditional NPQIV restriction, where the unknown quantile
function is approximated by a penalized sieve. Under some regularity
conditions, we show that the self-normalized penalized sieve GEL estimator of
the WAD of a NPQIV is asymptotically standard normal. We also show that the

Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) calculations are carried out. The role of triaxiality
is studied within triaxial RHB and triaxial relativistic mean field + BCS
frameworks. With increasing proton number beyond Z~130 the transition from
ellipsoidal-like nuclear shapes to toroidal ones takes place. The description
of latter shapes requires the basis which is typically significantly larger
than the one employed for the description of ellipsoidal-like shapes. Many
hyperheavy nuclei with toroidal shapes are expected to be unstable towards
multifragmentation. However, three islands of stability of spherical hyperheavy
nuclei have been predicted for the first time in Ref. [1]. Proton and neutron
densities, charge radii, neutron skins and underlying shell structure of the
nuclei located in the centers of these islands have been investigated in
detail. Large neutron shell gaps at N=228, 308 and 406 define approximate
centers of these islands in neutron number. On the contrary, large proton gap
appear only at Z=154 in the (Z~156, N~310) island. As a result, this is the
largest island of stability of spherical hyperheavy nuclei found in the
calculations. The calculations indicate the stability of the nuclei in these

dynamical observables is one such recurring feature found in a vast array of
contexts. This phenomenon, known as critical slowing down, is well studied
mostly in thermodynamic phase transitions. However, it is less understood in
highly nonequilibrium settings, where the time it takes to traverse the phase
boundary becomes comparable to the timescale of dynamical fluctuations. Using
transient optical spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction, we studied
a photo-induced transition of a model charge-density-wave (CDW) compound,
LaTe$_3$. We observed that it takes the longest time to suppress the order
parameter at the threshold photoexcitation density, where the CDW transiently
vanishes. This finding can be quantitatively captured by generalizing the
time-dependent Landau theory to a system far from equilibrium. The experimental
observation and theoretical understanding of dynamical slowing down may offer
insight into other general principles behind nonequilibrium phase transitions

and characterized by measuring magnetic and transport properties, scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) and spectroscopy (STS). The magnetic structure of
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ below T$_N$ is determined by powder and single crystal neutron
diffraction measurements. Below T$_N$=24\,K, Mn$^{2+}$ moments order
ferromagnetically in the \textit{ab} plane but antiferromagnetically along the
crystallographic \textit{c} axis. The ordered moment is 4.04(13) $\mu_{B}$/Mn
at 10\,K and aligned along the crystallographic \textit{c}-axis. The electrical
resistivity drops upon cooling across T$_N$ or when going across the
metamagnetic transition in increasing fields below T$_N$. A critical scattering
effect was observed in the vicinity of T$_N$ in the temperature dependence of
thermal conductivity. However, A linear temperature dependence was observed for
thermopower in the temperature range 2K-300K without any anomaly around T$_N$.
These indicate that the magnetic order in Mn-Te layer has negligible effect on
the electronic band structure, which makes possible the realization of proposed
topological properties in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ after fine tuning of the electronic
band structure.

phase-space distribution of stars in the Milky Way. In cylindrical Galactic
coordinates $(R,\phi,z)$, ridge-like structures can be seen in the \vphiR{}
plane and asymmetric arch-like structures in the \vphivR{} plane. We show that
the ridges are also clearly present when the third dimension of the \vphiR{}
plane is represented by $\langle z \rangle$, $\langle V_z \rangle$, $\langle
V_R \rangle$, $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ and $\langle[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]\rangle$.
The maps suggest that stars along the ridges lie preferentially close to the
Galactic midplane ($|z|<0.2$ kpc), and have metallicity and $\alpha$ elemental
abundance similar to that of the Sun. We show that phase mixing of disrupting
spiral arms can generate both the ridges and the arches. It also generates
discrete groupings in orbital energy $-$ the ridges and arches are simply
surfaces of constant energy. We identify 8 distinct ridges in the \gaia{} data:
six of them have constant energy while two have constant angular momentum.
Given that the signature is strongest for stars close to the plane, the
presence of ridges in $\langle z \rangle$ and $\langle V_z \rangle$ suggests a
coupling between planar and vertical directions. We demonstrate, using N-body
simulations that such coupling can be generated both in isolated discs and in
discs perturbed by an orbiting satellite like the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.

abstract simplicial complexes, where the concept of `homotopy' has been
replaced by that of `contiguity'. Then a fibration will be a simplicial map
satisfying the `contiguity lifting property'. This definition turns out to be
equivalent to a known notion introduced by G. Minian, established in terms of a
cylinder construction $K \times I_m$. This allows us to prove several
properties of simplicial fibrations which are analogous to the classical ones
in the topological setting, for instance: all the fibers of a fibration have
the same strong homotopy type, a notion that has been recently introduced by
Barmak and Minian; any fibration with a strongly collapsible base is fibrewise
trivial; and some other ones. We introduce the concept of `simplicial
finite-fibration', that is, a map which has the contiguity lifting property
only for finite complexes. Then, we prove that the path fibration $PK \to
K\times K$ is a finite-fibration, where PK is the space of Moore paths
introduced by M. Grandis. This important result allows us to prove that any
simplicial map factors through a finite-fibration, up to a P-homotopy
equivalence. Moreover, we introduce a definition of `\v{S}varc genus' of a
simplicial map and, and using the properties stated before, we are able to
compare the \v{S}varc genus of path fibrations with the notions of simplicial
LS-category and simplicial topological complexity introduced by the authors in
several previous papers. Finally, another key result is a simplicial version of
a Varadarajan result for fibrations, relating the LS-category of the total
space, the base and the generic fiber.

show that the number of events of similar luminosity in ASKAP does not scale as
distance cubed, as one would expect, when directly using the observed
dispersion measure (DM) to infer distance. Second, by comparing the average DMs
of FRBs observed with different instruments, we estimated the average redshift
of ASKAP FRBs to be $z\sim 0.01$ using CHIME and ASKAP, and $z\lesssim0.07$
using Parkes and ASKAP. Both values are much smaller than the upper limit
$z\sim0.3$ estimated directly from the DM. Third, we cross-correlate the
locations of the ASKAP FRBs with existing large-area redshift surveys, and see
a 3$\sigma$ correlation with the 2MASS Redshift Survey and a 5$\sigma$
correlation with the HI Parkes All Sky Survey at $z\sim0.007$. This corresponds
well with the redshift of the most likely host galaxy of ASKAP FRB 171020,

origin of ASKAP FRBs and a local environment with accumulated electrons that

There is no unusual atomic gas concentration near the position of AT2018cow.
The gas distribution is much more regular than those of GRB/SN hosts. The
AT2018cow host has an atomic gas mass lower by 0.24 dex than predicted from its
star formation rate (SFR) and is at the lower edge of the galaxy main sequence.
In the continuum we detected the emission of AT2018cow and of a star-forming
region in the north-eastern part of the bar (away from AT2018cow). This region
hosts a third of the galaxy's SFR. The absence of atomic gas concentration
close to AT2018cow, along with a normal SFR and regular HI velocity field, sets
CGCG137-068 apart from GRB/SN hosts studied in HI. The environment of AT2018cow
therefore suggests that its progenitor may not have been a massive star. Our
findings are consistent with an origin of the transient that does not require a
connection between its progenitor and gas concentration or inflow: an exploding
low-mass star, a tidal disruption event, a merger of white dwarfs, or a merger
between a neutron star and a giant star. We interpret the recently reported
atomic gas ring in CGCG137-068 as a result of internal processes connected with
gravitational resonances caused by the bar.

linearisation of black-box models around an expansion point. Consequently, we
obtain simple ""filter equations"" for an effective posterior of the primordial

a priori, and perfectly parallel. As a proof of concept, we apply our framework
to a realistic synthetic galaxy survey, with a data model accounting for
physical structure formation and incomplete and noisy galaxy observations. In
doing so, we show that the use of non-linear numerical models allows the galaxy
power spectrum to be safely fitted up to at least $k_\mathrm{max} = 0.5$

fragmentation into companion stars. We find that subvirial cores undergo rapid

properties. In contrast, we find that virialized cores undergo a slower,
gradual collapse and significant turbulent fragmentation at early times

and protostellar outflows we find that the faster growth rate of massive stars
that are born out of subvirial cores leads to an increase in the radiative
heating of the core thereby further suppressing fragmentation at early times
when turbulent fragmentation occurs for virialized cores. Regardless of initial
condition, we find that the massive accretion disks that form around massive
stars dominant the accretion flow onto the star at late times and eventually
become gravitationally unstable and fragment to form companion stars at late
times.

but do not substantially favor the anisotropic model ($B_{SI-DM}=0.4$). We
consider several priors and find that this evidence ratio is robust to prior

study of their central dark matter fraction ($f_{\rm DM}$) and their mass
density slope ($\alpha$), within their effective radius. We show that
lower-mass spiral galaxies are more dark matter dominated and have more shallow
mass density slopes when compared with more massive galaxies, which have
density profiles closer to isothermal. Low-mass ($M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{10}\,
\rm M_{\odot}$) gas-rich spirals span a wide range of \fdm\ values, but
systematically lower than in gas-poor systems of similar mass. With increasing
galaxy mass, the values of \fdm\ decrease and the density profiles steepen. In
the most massive late-type gas-poor galaxies, a possible flattening of these
trends is observed. When comparing these results to massive ($M_{\star} \gtrsim
10^{10}M_{\odot}$) elliptical galaxies from SPIDER and to dwarf ellipticals
from SMACKED, these trends result to be inverted. Hence, the values of both
$f_{\rm DM}$ and $\alpha$, as a function of $M_{\star}$, exhibit a U-shape
trend. At a fixed stellar mass, the mass density profiles in dwarf ellipticals
are steeper than in spirals. These trends can be understood by stellar feedback
from a more prolonged star formation period in spirals, causing a
transformation of the initial steep density cusp to a more shallow profile via
differential feedback efficiency by supernovae, and by galaxy mergers or AGN
feedback in higher-mass galaxies.

predict color appearance under a wide variety of viewing conditions. A
chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) is an integral part of a CAM. Its role is
to predict ""corresponding colors,"" that is, a pair of colors that have the same
color appearance when viewed under different illuminants, after partial or full
adaptation to each illuminant. Modern CATs perform well when applied to a
limited range of illuminant pairs and a limited range of source (test) colors.
However, they can fail if operated outside these ranges. For imaging
applications, it is important to have a CAT that can operate on any real color
and illuminant pair without failure. This paper proposes a new CAT that does
not operate on the standard von Kries model of adaptation. Instead it relies on
spectral reconstruction and how these reconstructions behave with respect to
different illuminants. It is demonstrated that the proposed CAT is immune to
some of the limitations of existing CATs (such as producing colors with
negative tristimulus values). The proposed CAT does not use established
empirical corresponding-color datasets to optimize performance, as most modern
CATs do, yet it performs as well as or better than the most recent CATs when
tested against the corresponding-color datasets. This increase in robustness
comes at the expense of additional complexity and computational effort. If
robustness is of prime importance, then the proposed method may be justifiable.

boundary propagators. Quantum bulk corrections instead arise from stripped
higher order diagrams and back-reaction effects; these are also mapped to the
structure for $G_N^0$ terms found in \cite{Faulkner:2013ana}, with the former
identified as the bulk entanglement entropy across the Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces.
An independent derivation of this last statement is provided by implementing a
twist-line formalism in the bulk, and additional checks from the computation of
mutual information and single interval entanglement entropy. Finally an
interesting correspondence is found between the recently proposed holographic
entanglement of purification, and an approximated form for certain $1/c$ Renyi
entropies corrections.

shows that SAKEIMA allows to rigorously approximate frequent $k$-mers by

then build both Jeans Anisotropic Models and axisymmetric Schwarzschild models

black hole masses which are consistent with recent MBH-{\sigma}e scaling
relations. NGC 3640 has a velocity dispersion dip and NGC 7049 a constant

resolution of 14.4 arcsec, significantly improving upon the 353-GHz resolution
of Planck at 5 arcmin, and allowing for a catalogue of 3528 compact sources in
558 PGCCs. We find that the detected PGCCs have significant sub-structure, with
61 per cent of detected PGCCs having 3 or more compact sources, with
filamentary structure also prevalent within the sample. A detection rate of 45
per cent is found across the survey, which is 95 per cent complete to Planck
column densities of $N_{H_{2}}$ $>$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. By
positionally associating the SCOPE compact sources with YSOs, the star
formation efficiency, as measured by the ratio of luminosity to mass, in nearby
clouds is found to be similar to that in the more distant Galactic Plane, with
the column density distributions also indistinguishable from each other.

compact spheres using Lorenz-Mie theory or as porous spheres by incorporating
an effective medium theory. In this work we examine the effect of incorporating
a more realistic particle morphology on estimated radiation-pressure blowout
sizes. To calculate the scattering and absorption cross sections of irregularly
shaped dust grains, we use the discrete dipole approximation. These cross
sections are necessary to calculate the $\beta$-ratio, which determines whether
dust grains can remain gravitationally bound to their star. We calculate
blowout sizes for a range of stellar spectral types corresponding with stars
known to host debris disks. As with compact spheres, more luminous stars blow
out larger irregularly shaped dust grains. We also find that dust grain
composition influences blowout size such that absorptive grains are more
readily removed from the disk. Moreover, the difference between blowout sizes
calculated assuming spherical particles versus particle morphologies more
representative of real dust particles is compositionally dependent as well,
with blowout size estimates diverging further for transparent grains. We find
that the blowout sizes calculated have a strong dependence on the particle
model used, with differences in the blowout size calculated being as large as
an order of magnitude for particles of similar porosities.

A_{t}^{m_{t}}$ is equal to the zero matrix? It is known that this problem is
decidable when $t \leq 2$ for matrices over algebraic numbers but becomes
undecidable for sufficiently large $t$ and $k$ even for integral matrices.
  In this paper, we prove the first decidability results for $t>2$. We show as
one of our central results that for $t=3$ this problem in any dimension is
Turing equivalent to the well-known Skolem problem for linear recurrence
sequences. Our proof relies on the Primary Decomposition Theorem for matrices
that was not used to show decidability results in matrix semigroups before. As
a corollary we obtain that the above problem is decidable for $t=3$ and $k \leq
3$ for matrices over algebraic numbers and for $t=3$ and $k=4$ for matrices
over real algebraic numbers. Another consequence is that the set of triples
$(m_1,m_2,m_3)$ for which the equation $A_1^{m_1} A_2^{m_2} A_3^{m_3}$ equals
the zero matrix is equal to a finite union of direct products of semilinear
sets.
  For $t=4$ we show that the solution set can be non-semilinear, and thus it
seems unlikely that there is a direct connection to the Skolem problem. However
we prove that the problem is still decidable for upper-triangular $2 \times 2$

Baker's theorem and S-unit equations.

settings. We propose passive free-running SPAD (PF-SPAD) imaging, an imaging
modality that uses SPADs for capturing 2D intensity images with unprecedented
dynamic range under ambient lighting, without any active light source. Our key
observation is that the precise inter-photon timing measured by a SPAD can be

derive a scene brightness estimator based on the average time of darkness
between successive photons detected by a PF-SPAD pixel. Our key insight is that
due to the stochastic nature of photon arrivals, this estimator does not suffer
from a hard saturation limit. Coupled with high sensitivity at low flux, this
enables a PF-SPAD pixel to measure a wide range of scene brightness, from very
low to very high, thereby achieving extreme dynamic range. We demonstrate an
improvement of over 2 orders of magnitude over conventional sensors by imaging
scenes spanning a dynamic range of 1,000,000:1.

covariates when testing for differences between multivariate means of several
groups. However, the ""classical"" parametric multivariate analysis of covariance
(MANCOVA) tests (e.g., Wilks' Lambda) are based on quite restrictive
assumptions (homoscedasticity and normality of the errors), which might be
difficult to justify in small sample size settings. Furthermore, existing
potential remedies (e.g., heteroskedasticity-robust approaches) become
inappropriate in cases where the covariance matrices are singular.
Nevertheless, such scenarios are frequently encountered in the life sciences
and other fields, when for example, in the context of standardized assessments,
a summary performance measure as well as its corresponding subscales are
analyzed. In the present manuscript, we consider a general MANCOVA model,
allowing for potentially heteroskedastic and even singular covariance matrices
as well as non-normal errors. We combine heteroskedasticity-consistent
covariance matrix estimation methods with our proposed modified MANCOVA
ANOVA-type statistic (MANCATS) and apply two different bootstrap approaches. We
provide the proofs of the asymptotic validity of the respective testing
procedures as well as the results from an extensive simulation study, which
indicate that especially the parametric bootstrap version of the MANCATS
outperforms its competitors in most scenarios, both in terms of type I error
rates and power. These considerations are further illustrated and substantiated
by examining real-life data from standardized achievement tests.

knowledge graphs for predicting missing links. The success of such a task
heavily relies on the ability of modeling and inferring the patterns of (or
between) the relations. In this paper, we present a new approach for knowledge
graph embedding called RotatE, which is able to model and infer various
relation patterns including: symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition.
Specifically, the RotatE model defines each relation as a rotation from the
source entity to the target entity in the complex vector space. In addition, we
propose a novel self-adversarial negative sampling technique for efficiently
and effectively training the RotatE model. Experimental results on multiple
benchmark knowledge graphs show that the proposed RotatE model is not only
scalable, but also able to infer and model various relation patterns and
significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction.

enables two tiers of commercial users to share spectrum with a third tier of
incumbent users. This sharing can be further assisted by Environmental Sensing
Capability operators (ESCs), that monitor the spectrum occupancy to determine
when use of the spectrum will not harm incumbents. Two key aspects of this
framework that impact how firms may compete are the differences in information
provided by different ESCs and the different tiers in which a firm may access
the spectrum. We develop a game theoretic model that captures both of these
features and analyze it to gain insight into their impact. Specifically, we
consider a priority access (PA) tier firm has access to the both licensed band
and unlicensed band, and a general authorized access (GAA) tier firm has access
only to the unlicensed band. The PA tier and GAA tier firms compete for users.
Our analysis reveals that the amount of unlicensed and licensed bandwidth in
the CBRS must be chosen judiciously in order to maximize the social welfare. We
also show that a limited amount of unlicensed access of PA tier firm is
beneficial to the user's surplus as well as to the social welfare.

Unfortunately, reasoning systems based on SGs are typically trained in a

separate model is created to reason based on predicted SGs. In many domains, it
is preferable to train systems jointly in an end-to-end manner, but SGs are not
commonly used as intermediate components in visual reasoning systems because
being discrete and sparse, scene-graph representations are non-differentiable
and difficult to optimize. Here we propose Differentiable Scene Graphs (DSGs),
an image representation that is amenable to differentiable end-to-end

provide a dense representation for all regions and pairs of regions, and do not

attracted much attention as it can help identify at-risk students early so that
personalized feedback can be provided to them on time by advisors. Prior
research on students' grade prediction include shallow linear models; however,
students' learning is a highly complex process that involves the accumulation
of knowledge across a sequence of courses that can not be sufficiently modeled

prediction accuracy without considering prediction uncertainty, which is

achieve better performance than prior state-of-the-art approaches. Besides more
accurate results, Bayesian deep learning models estimate uncertainty associated

demonstration experiment. We found in a $Predict-Observe-Explain$-setting, that
after predicting the outcome prior to the demonstration, only one out of five
physics students correctly reported the observation of the trajectory of a
sphere rolling over a rotating disc. Despite this low score, a detailed
analysis of distractors revealed significant conceptual learning during the
observation of the experiment. In this context, we identified three main
misconceptions and learning difficulties. First, the centrifugal force is only
required to describe the trajectory if the object is coupled to the rotating
system. Second, inertial forces cause a reaction of an object on which they
act. And third, students systematically mix-up the trajectories in the
stationary and the rotating frame of reference. Furthermore, we captured
students' eye movements during the $Predict$ task and found that physics
students with low confidence ratings focused longer on relevant task areas than
confident students despite having a comparable score. Consequently, this metric
is a helpful tool for the identification of misconceptions using eye tracking.
Overall, the results help to understand the complexity of concept learning from
demonstration experiments and provide important implications for instructional
design of introductions to rotating frames of reference.

crucial role in CR transport, leading to growth of Alfv\'en waves at small
scales that scatter CRs, and impacts the interaction of CRs with the ISM on
large scales. However, extreme scale separation ($\lambda \ll \rm pc$), low
cosmic ray number density ($n_{\rm CR}/n_{\rm ISM} \sim 10^{-9}$), and weak CR
anisotropy ($\sim v_A/c$) pose strong challenges for proper numerical studies
of this instability on a microphysical level. Employing the recently developed
magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method, which has unique
advantages to alleviate these issues, we conduct one-dimensional simulations
that quantitatively demonstrate the growth and saturation of the instability in
the parameter regime consistent with realistic CR streaming in the large-scale
ISM. Our implementation of the $\delta f$ method dramatically reduces Poisson
noise and enables us to accurately capture wave growth over a broad spectrum,
equally shared between left and right handed Alfv\'en modes. We are also able
to accurately follow the quasi-linear diffusion of CRs subsequent to wave
growth, which is achieved by employing phase randomization across periodic
boundaries. Full isotropization of the CRs in the wave frame requires pitch
angles of most CRs to efficiently cross $90^\circ$, and can be captured in
simulations with relatively high wave amplitude and/or high spatial resolution.
We attribute this crossing to non-linear wave-particle interaction (rather than
mirror reflection) by investigating individual CR trajectories. We anticipate
our methodology will open up opportunities for future investigations that
incorporate additional physics.

decreases significantly at high frequencies with a negative spectral index. The

lead to serious medical complications. In order to optimally predict AKI before

which AKI is continually predicted automatically from EHR data over the entire
hospital stay instead of at only one particular time. The continual model
predicts AKI every time a patients AKI-relevant variable changes in the EHR.
Thus the model is not only independent of a particular time for making
predictions, but it can also leverage the latest values of all the AKI-relevant
patient variables for making predictions. Using data of 44,691 hospital stays
of duration longer than 24 hours we evaluated our continual prediction model
and compared it with the traditional one-time prediction models. Excluding
hospitals stays in which AKI occurred within 24 hours from admission, the
one-time prediction model predicting at 24 hours from admission obtained area
under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.653 while the continual prediction model obtained
AUC of 0.724. The one-time prediction model that predicts at 24 hours obviously
cannot predict AKI incidences that occur within 24 hours of admission which
when included in the evaluation reduced its AUC to 0.57. In comparison, the
continual prediction model had AUC of 0.709. The continual prediction model
also did better than all other one-time prediction models predicting at other

and are advanced in time with an explicit time marching scheme. The
discretisation meshes may contain simplicial (triangular or tetrahedral)
elements of different sizes and need not be structured. On the discretisation
mesh the fluid domain boundary is represented with an implicit signed distance
function. The cut-elements partially covered by the solid domain are integrated
after tessellation with the marching triangle or tetrahedra algorithms. Two
alternative techniques are introduced to overcome the excessive stable time
step restrictions imposed by cut-elements. In the first approach the cut-basis
functions are replaced with the extrapolated basis functions from the nearest
largest element. In the second approach the cut-basis functions are simply
scaled proportionally to the fraction of the cut-element covered by the solid.
To achieve high-order accuracy additional nodes are introduced on the element
faces abutting the solid boundary. Subsequently, the faces are curved by
projecting the introduced nodes to the boundary. The proposed approach is
verified and validated with several two- and three-dimensional subsonic and
hypersonic low Reynolds number flow applications, including the flow over a

both spatial extent and ecosystem services, but they are also declining
worldwide. Understanding the drivers of seagrass meadow dynamics is essential
for designing sound management, conservation, and restoration strategies.
However, the poor knowledge of the effect of clonality on the population
genetics of natural populations severely limits our understanding of the
dynamics and connectivity of meadows. Recent modelling approaches have
described the expected distributions of genotypic and genetic descriptors under
increasing clonal rates. Here, in light of these recent theoretical
developments, we revisited population genetic data for 165 meadows of four
seagrass species. Contrasting shoot life span and rhizome turnover led to the
prediction that the influence of asexual reproduction will increase along a
gradient from Zostera noltii to Zostera marina, Cymodocea nodosa and Posidonia
oceanica, which should be reflected by an increasing departure from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Fis) and decreasing genotypic diversity (R). This
meta-analysis provides a nested validation of this hypothesis at both the
species and meadow scales through a significant relationship between Fis and R
within each species. By empirically demonstrating the theoretical expectations
derived from recent modelling approaches, this work calls for the use of
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Fis) rather than the strongly sampling-sensitive
genotypic index R to assess the importance of clonal reproduction, at least
when the impact of selfing on Fis can be neglected. The results also emphasize
the need to revise our appraisal of the extent of clonality and its influence
on the dynamics, connectivity and evolutionary trajectory of partial asexuals
in general, including in seagrass meadows, to develop the most accurate
management strategies.

away from thermal equilibrium and approach relativistic speeds. These highly
energetic runaway electrons (MeV) play a significant role in tokamak disruption
physics, and therefore their accurate understanding is essential to develop
reliable mitigation strategies. For this purpose, we have developed a fully
implicit solver for the 0D-2P (i.e., including two momenta coordinates)
relativistic nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation (rFP). As in earlier implicit rFP
studies (NORSE, CQL3D), electron-ion interactions are modeled using the Lorentz
operator, and synchrotron damping using the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac reaction
term. However, our implementation improves on these earlier studies by 1)
ensuring exact conservation properties for electron collisions, 2) strictly
preserving positivity, and 3) being scalable algorithmically and in parallel.
Key to our proposed approach is an efficient multigrid preconditioner for the
linearized rFP equation, a multigrid elliptic solver for the Braams-Karney
potentials [Braams and Karney, Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 16 (1987)], and a novel
adaptive technique to determine the associated boundary values. We verify the
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme with numerical results ranging
from small electric-field electrical conductivity measurements to the accurate
reproduction of runaway tail dynamics when strong electric fields are applied.

case of isosping-violating dark matter, we find that there are regions in the
parameter space where DEAP-3600 actually provides the most stringent limits on
the dark matter-proton spin-independent cross section. Such regions correspond
to the so-called Xenonphobic dark matter scenario, for which the
neutron-to-proton coupling ratio is close to $-0.7$. Our results seem to signal
the beginning of a new era in which the complementarity among different direct
detection targets will play a crucial role in the determination of the
fundamental properties of the dark matter particle.

well-posedness of Bayesian inverse problems. The conventional concept of
(Lipschitz, Hellinger) well-posedness in [Stuart 2010, Acta Numerica 19, pp.
451-559] is difficult to verify in practice and may be inappropriate in some
contexts. Our concept simply replaces the Lipschitz continuity of the posterior
measure in the Hellinger distance by continuity in an appropriate distance
between probability measures. Aside from the Hellinger distance, we investigate
well-posedness with respect to weak convergence, the total variation distance,
the Wasserstein distance, and also the Kullback--Leibler divergence. We
demonstrate that the weakening to continuity is tolerable and that the
generalisation to other distances is important. The main results of this
article are proofs of well-posedness with respect to some of the aforementioned
distances for large classes of Bayesian inverse problems. Here, little or no
information about the underlying model is necessary; making these results
particularly interesting for practitioners using black-box models. We
illustrate our findings with numerical examples motivated from machine learning
and image processing.

channels with smaller activation energies. The effects of catalytic VSC are
maximal at light-matter resonance, in agreement with experimental observations.

currently spurring worldwide activities focused on defining the next-generation
6G wireless system that can truly integrate far-reaching applications ranging

initiatives1, the fundamental architectural and performance components of the
system remain largely undefined. In this paper, we present a holistic,
forward-looking vision that defines the tenets of a 6G system. We opine that 6G
will not be a mere exploration of more spectrum at high-frequency bands, but it
will rather be a convergence of upcoming technological trends driven by
exciting, underlying services. In this regard, we first identify the primary
drivers of 6G systems, in terms of applications and accompanying technological
trends. Then, we propose a new set of service classes and expose their target
6G performance requirements. We then identify the enabling technologies for the
introduced 6G services and outline a comprehensive research agenda that
leverages those technologies. We conclude by providing concrete recommendations
for the roadmap toward 6G. Ultimately, the intent of this article is to serve
as a basis for stimulating more out-of-the-box research around 6G.

it is desirable to have a formulation of small size for the given problem. A
useful approach for this is the construction of an extended formulation, which
is a linear program in a higher dimensional space whose projection yields the
original linear program. For many problems it is known that a small extended
formulation cannot exist. However, most of these problems are either
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard (like TSP), or only quite complicated polynomial time
algorithms are known for them (like for the matching problem). In this work we
study the minimum makespan problem on identical machines in which we want to
assign a set of $n$ given jobs to $m$ machines in order to minimize the maximum

show that there is an abstraction of the configuration integer program

adopting a zero-shot learning (ZSL) approach for 3D data, similar to the 2D

comparing semantic information (attribute/word vector) of seen and unseen

exceedingly inferior to other methods on several benchmark datasets

by a significant margin under some elementary changes in their core algorithmic
idea \cite{dai2014simple}. Now, these results not only exposes some unrevealed
areas for research in NRSfM but also give rise to new mathematical challenges
for NRSfM researchers. We argue that by \textbf{properly} utilizing the
well-established assumptions about a non-rigidly deforming shape i.e, it
deforms smoothly over frames \cite{rabaud2008re} and it spans a low-rank space,
the simple prior-free idea can provide results which is comparable to the best
available algorithms. In this paper, we explore some of the hidden intricacies
missed by Dai {\it{et. al.}} work \cite{dai2014simple} and how some elementary
measures and modifications can enhance its performance, as high as approx. 18\%

compensated by inversion partners near the {\Gamma} point but immune from

practical obstacles including channel state information (CSI) errors, noise,
co-channel interferences, and pilot contamination. To optimize the overall
receiver performance in PDCCH blind detection, we incorporate the polar code
information during the signal detection stage by relaxing and transforming the

develop a novel joint linear programming (LP) formulation that takes into
consideration the transformed polar code constraints. Our proposed joint LP
formulation can also be integrated with polar decoders to deliver superior
receiver performance at low cost. We further introduce a metric that can be
used to eliminate most of wrong PDCCH candidates to improve the computational
efficiency of PDCCH blind detection for 5G-NR.

separation an unbalanced distribution of charge density resulting in the
spontaneous apparition of localized magnetic moments without disrupting the

Substitutional doping shifts the chemical potential of one spin distribution

statistical tool for characterising transport in nanoscale quantum transport.
In particular, as opposed to moments of the distribution of transferred charge,
which have historically been calculated in the long-time limit, waiting times
are able to detect non-renewal behaviour in mesoscopic systems. They have
failed, however, to correctly incorporate backtunneling events. Recently, a
method has been developed that can describe unidirectional and bidirectional
transport on an equal footing: the distribution of first-passage times. Rather
than the time between successive electron tunnelings, the first-passage refers
to the first time the number of extra electrons in the drain reaches $+1$.
Here, we demonstrate the differences between first-passage time statistics and
waiting time statistics in transport scenarios where the waiting time either
cannot correctly reproduce the higher order current cumulants or cannot be
calculated at all. To this end, we examine electron transport through a
molecule coupled to two macroscopic metal electrodes. We model the molecule
with strong electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in three
regimes: (i) sequential tunneling and cotunneling for a finite bias voltage
through the Anderson model, (ii) sequential tunneling with no temperature
gradient and a bias voltage through the Holstein model, and (iii) sequential
tunneling at zero bias voltage and a temperature gradient through the Holstein
model. We show that, for each transport scenario, backtunneling events play a
significant role; consequently, the waiting time statistics do not correctly
predict the renewal and non-renewal behaviour, whereas the first-passage time
distribution does.

unique topology and symmetry are anticipated to host nontrivial functional
responses. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the coherent propagation of spin
excitations along skyrmion strings for the chiral-lattice magnet Cu2OSeO3. We
find that this propagation is directionally non-reciprocal, and the degree of
non-reciprocity, as well as the associated group velocity and decay length, are
strongly dependent on the character of the excitation modes. Our theoretical
calculation establishes the corresponding dispersion relationship, which well
reproduces the experimentally observed features. Notably, these spin

afterglow image whose flux centroid moved superluminally with
$v_{\rm{app}}\approx4c$, clearly indicating that the afterglow was dominated by
a relativistic jet's compact core. Different jet angular structures explained
the afterglow lightcurves: Gaussian and steep power-law profiles with narrow

$\theta_{\rm{}obs}/\theta_c\sim3-5$. However, a top-hat jet (with sharp edges

we show that the initial steep flux rise is an artifact caused by the

$t<t_0$ and sometimes ""compensated"" using an analytic top-hat jet. While an
initially top-hat jet is not very physical, such simulations are particularly
useful at $t_{\rm{}obs}\gtrsim{}t_{\rm{obs,pk}}$ when the afterglow emission is

$\mathrm{arsinh}(r)=\int_{0}^{r} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2} }\mathrm{d}t$ is similar
to the inverse trigonometric function $\mathrm{arcsin}(r)=\int_{0}^{r}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t^2} }\mathrm{d}t$, such as the second degree of a polynomial
and the constant term 1, except for the sign $-$ and $+$. Such an analogy holds
not only when the degree of the polynomial is 2, but also for higher degrees.
As such, a function exists with respect to the leaf function through the
imaginary number $i$, such that the hyperbolic function exists with respect to
the trigonometric function through this imaginary number. In this study, we
refer to this function as the hyperbolic leaf function. By making such a
definition, the relation equation between the leaf function and the hyperbolic
leaf function makes it possible to easily derive various formulas, such as
addition formulas of hyperbolic leaf functions based on the addition formulas
of leaf functions. Using the addition formulas, we can also derive the double
angle and half-angle formulas. We then verify the consistency of these formulas
by constructing graphs and numerical data.

perspectives, both of the disk and the tail-like structure components
physically connect to each other. Several theoretical studies predicted the
observed tail-like structure via the following possible scenarios, 1) a gaseous
stream from the molecular cloud remnant, 2) collision with a (sub)stellar
intruder or a gaseous blob from the ambient cloud, and 3) ejection of a
planetary or brown dwarf mass object due to gravitational instability via
multi-body gravitational interaction. Since the tail-like structures associated

experience the internal or external interaction and drastically lose mass

the buyer that could even be randomized. Such complexity is thought to be
necessary as the revenue gaps between randomized and deterministic mechanisms,
or deterministic and simple mechanisms are huge even for additive valuations.
  We challenge this conventional belief by showing that these large gaps can
only happen in restricted situations. These are situations where the mechanism
overcharges a buyer for a bundle while selling individual items at much lower
prices. Arguably this is impractical in many settings because the buyer can
break his order into smaller pieces paying a much lower price overall. Our main
result is that if the buyer is allowed to purchase as many (randomized) bundles
as he pleases, the revenue of any multi-item mechanism is at most O(logn) times
the revenue achievable by item pricing, where n is the number of items. This
holds in the most general setting possible, with an arbitrarily correlated
distribution of buyer types and arbitrary valuations.
  We also show that this result is tight in a very strong sense. Any family of
mechanisms of subexponential description complexity cannot achieve better than
logarithmic approximation even against the best deterministic mechanism and
even for additive valuations. In contrast, item pricing that has linear
description complexity matches this bound against randomized mechanisms.

to solve the packet classification problem. There are several characteristics
that make this problem a good fit for Deep RL. First, many of the existing

evaluated once we are done with building the tree. These two characteristics
are naturally captured by the ability of RL to take actions that have sparse

succinct representations to encode state and action space, and efficiently
explore candidate decision trees to optimize for a global objective. It
produces compact decision trees optimized for a specific set of rules and a

of the model and the \textit{actual system} is not known; and hence it is
difficult to provide safety guarantees for the system. In such cases, the
Standard Simulation Metric (SSM), defined as the worst-case norm distance
between the model and the system output trajectories, can be used to modify a
reach-avoid specification for the system into a more stringent specification
for the abstraction. Nevertheless, the obtained distance, and hence the
modified specification, can be quite conservative. This limits the set of
environments for which a safe controller can be obtained. We propose SPEC, a
specification-centric simulation metric, which overcomes these limitations by
computing the distance using only the trajectories that violate the
specification for the system. We show that modifying a reach-avoid
specification with SPEC allows us to synthesize a safe controller for a larger
set of environments compared to SSM. We also propose a probabilistic method to
compute SPEC for a general class of systems. Case studies using simulators for

avenues for probing self-organization principles in these far-from-equilibrium
systems. It has been hypothesized that the dissipation of free energy by active
matter systems may be optimized to produce highly dissipative dynamical states,
hence, leading to spontaneous emergence of more ordered states. This
interesting idea has not been widely tested. In particular, it is not clear
whether emergent states of actomyosin networks, which represent a salient
example of biological active matter, self-organize following the principle of
dissipation optimization. In order to start addressing this question using
detailed computational modeling, we rely on the MEDYAN simulation platform,
which allows simulating active matter networks from fundamental molecular
principles. We have extended the capabilities of MEDYAN to allow quantification
of the rates of dissipation resulting from chemical reactions and relaxation of
mechanical stresses during simulation trajectories. We validate our approach
with a mean-field model that estimates the rates of dissipation from filament
treadmilling. Applying this methodology to the self-organization of small
disordered actomyosin networks, we find that compact and highly cross-linked
networks tend to allow more efficient transduction of chemical free energy into
mechanical energy. In these simple systems, we do not observe that spontaneous
network reorganizations lead to increases in the total dissipation rate as
predicted by the dissipation-driven adaptation hypothesis mentioned above.
However, whether such a principle operates in more general, more complex
cytoskeletal networks remains to be investigated.

challenging task, since communication circuits are power-demanding while energy

communication emerges as a promising solution as it eliminates radio frequency
components in IoT devices. Unfortunately, the transmission range of backscatter
communication is short. To facilitate backscatter communication, this work
proposes to integrate unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with backscatter data
collection. With such a scheme, the UGV could improve the communication quality
by approaching various IoT devices. However, moving also costs energy
consumption and a fundamental question is: what is the right balance between
spending energy on moving versus on communication? To answer this question,
this paper studies energy minimization under a joint graph mobility and
backscatter communication model. With the joint model, the mobility management
and power allocation problem unfortunately involves nonlinear coupling between
discrete variables brought by mobility and continuous variables brought by
communication. Despite the optimization challenges, an algorithm that
theoretically achieves the minimum energy consumption is derived, and it leads
to automatic trade-off between spending energy on moving versus on
communication in the UGV backscatter system. Simulation results show that if
the noise power is small (e.g., -100 dBm), the UGV should collect the data with
small movements. However, if the noise power is increased to a larger value
(e.g., -60 dBm), the UGV should spend more motion energy to get closer to IoT
users.

Nonetheless, distributed machine learning methods may be vulnerable to
Byzantine attack, in which the adversary can deliberately share falsified

asynchronous Byzantine tolerant SGD algorithms are proposed in this work, in
which the honest collaborative workers are assumed to store the model

The proposed algorithms can deal with an arbitrary number of Byzantine

between the $X$ and the neutral $SU(2)_L$ gauge boson (yielding the dark

cycles of a given undirected connected cubic graph. Our constructed polyhedron
is defined by polynomially-many linear constraints in polynomially-many
continuous (relaxed) variables. Clearly, the emptiness of the constructed
polyhedron implies that the graph is non-Hamiltonian. However, whenever a
constructed polyhedron is non-empty, the result is inconclusive. Hence, the
following natural question arises: if we assume that a non-empty polyhedron
implies Hamiltonicity, how frequently is this diagnosis incorrect? We prove
that, in the case of bridge graphs, the constructed polyhedron is always empty.
We also demonstrate that some non-bridge non-Hamiltonian cubic graphs induce
empty polyhedra as well. We compare our approach to the famous
Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson relaxation of a TSP, and give empirical evidence
which suggests that the latter is infeasible if and only if our constructed
polyhedron is also empty. By considering special edge cut sets which are
present in most cubic graphs, we describe a heuristic approach, built on our
constructed polyhedron, for which incorrect diagnoses of non-Hamiltonian graphs
as Hamiltonian appear to be very rare. In particular, for cubic graphs
containing up to 18 vertices, only four out of 45,982 undirected connected
cubic graphs were so misdiagnosed. By constrast, we demonstrate that an
equivalent heuristic, when built on the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson relaxation of
a TSP, is mostly unsuccessful in identifying additional non-Hamiltonian graphs.
These empirical results suggest that polynomial algorithms based on our

programming complexity beyond the skill-set of the average domain scientist. To
maintain performance portability in the future, it is imperative to decouple
architecture-specific programming paradigms from the underlying scientific

data-centric intermediate representation that enables separating program
definition from its optimization. By combining fine-grained data dependencies
with high-level control-flow, SDFGs are both expressive and amenable to program
transformations, such as tiling and double-buffering. These transformations are
applied to the SDFG in an interactive process, using extensible pattern
matching, graph rewriting, and a graphical user interface. We demonstrate SDFGs
on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs over various motifs --- from fundamental computational
kernels to graph analytics. We show that SDFGs deliver competitive performance,
allowing domain scientists to develop applications naturally and port them to
approach peak hardware performance without modifying the original scientific
code.

equation $u_t-\Delta^G_p u=0$ in a (not necessarily bounded) domain $\Omega$,
such that $u=0$ in $\Omega$ at time $t=0$ and $u=1$ on the boundary of $\Omega$
at all times. Here, $\Delta_p^G$ is the game-theoretic $p$-laplacian, a
$1$-homogeneous version of the standard $p$-laplacian. Also, we consider the
(viscosity) solution $u^\varepsilon$ of the nonlinear elliptic equation
$\varepsilon^2\Delta_p^G u^\varepsilon= u^\varepsilon$ in $\Omega$, satisfying
$u^\varepsilon=1$ on its boundary. In this thesis, we establish asymptotic
formulas for small positive values of $t$ and $\varepsilon$ involving both the
values of $u(x,t)$ and $u^\varepsilon(x)$ and their $q$-means on balls touching
the boundary. In the spirit of S.~R.~S.~Varadhan's work, we associate
appropriate rescalings of the values of $u(x,t)$ and $u^\varepsilon(x)$ to the
distance of $x$ to the boundary of $\Omega$. We also provide accurate uniform
estimates of the rate of approximation in these formulas, highlighting the
dependence on both the parameter $p$ and the regularity of the domain. The
uniform estimates are new results also in the linear case. Also, we connect the
asymptotic behavior of $q$-means on balls touching the boundary to a suitable
function of principal curvatures. These results generalize and extend formulas
for the heat content, obtained by R. Magnanini and S. Sakaguchi for $p=q=2$.
Finally, we give a few applications of the asymptotic formulas to geometric and
symmetry results. In particular, we characterize time-invariant level surfaces
of $u(x,t)$ (or $\varepsilon$-invariant level surfaces of $u^\varepsilon(x)$)
as spheres and hyperplanes.

learning some function of the unknown graph (e.g., all descendants of a target

rounds of experimentation. While it is in general computationally intractable
to select an optimal experimental design strategy, we provide a tractable

stem cells (CSC). SC and CSC heterogeneity is manifested as diverse
sub-populations with self-renewing and unique regeneration capacity. Moreover,
the CSC progeny possesses multiple plasticity and cancerous characteristics.
Many studies have demonstrated that cancer heterogeneity is one of the greatest
obstacle for therapy. This leads to the incomplete anti-cancer therapies and
transitory efficacy. Furthermore, numerous micro-metastasis leads to the wide
spread of the tumor cells across the body which is the beginning of metastasis.
The epigenetic processes (DNA methylation or histone remodification etc.) can
provide a source for certain heterogeneity. In this study, we develop a
mathematical model to quantify the heterogeneity of SC, CSC and cancer taking
both genetic and epigenetic effects into consideration. We uncovered the roles
and physical mechanisms of heterogeneity from the three aspects (SC, CSC and
cancer). In the adiabatic regime (relatively fast regulatory binding and
effective coupling among genes), seven native states (SC, CSC, Cancer,
Premalignant, Normal, Lesion and Hyperplasia) emerge. In non-adiabatic regime
(relatively slow regulatory binding and effective weak coupling among genes),
multiple meta-stable SC, CS, CSC and differentiated states emerged which can
explain the origin of heterogeneity. In other words, the slow regulatory
binding mimicking the epigenetics can give rise to heterogeneity. Elucidating
the origin of heterogeneity and dynamical interrelationship between
intra-tumoral cells has clear clinical significance in helping to understand
the cellular basis of treatment response, therapeutic resistance, and tumor
relapse.

continuous energy measurement exhibits quantum jumps between its energy levels
(Nagourney et al., 1986, Sauter et al., 1986, Bergquist et al., 1986). This
celebrated phenomenon is emblematic of the special nature of randomness in
quantum physics. The times at which the jumps occur are reputed to be
fundamentally unpredictable. However, certain classical phenomena, like
tsunamis, while unpredictable in the long term, may possess a degree of
predictability in the short term, and in some cases it may be possible to
prevent a disaster by detecting an advance warning signal. Can there be,
despite the indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a
quantum jump is about to occur or not? In this dissertation, we answer this
question affirmatively by experimentally demonstrating that the completed jump
from the ground to an excited state of a superconducting artificial atom can be
tracked, as it follows its predictable ""flight,"" by monitoring the population
of an auxiliary level coupled to the ground state. Furthermore, the
experimental results demonstrate that the jump when completed is continuous,
coherent, and deterministic. Exploiting these features, we catch and reverse a
quantum jump mid-flight, thus deterministically preventing its completion. This
real-time intervention is based on a particular lull period in the population
of the auxiliary level, which serves as our advance warning signal. Our
results, which agree with theoretical predictions essentially without
adjustable parameters, support the modern quantum trajectory theory and provide
new ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the
control of quantum systems, such as early detection of error syndromes.

Important in this construction is the fact that both Casimirs have the geometry

showing that this system can also appear when the geometry of one of the

pure transition from the tetragonal to the monoclinic structure leads to a
sizable charge difference between the two types of V ions, regardless of
magnetic orders. In the ferrimagnetic phase, inclusion of the on-site Coulomb
repulsion $U$ leads to a full orbital-polarization of V1 ($t_{2g}^{3\uparrow}$,
$S=\frac{3}{2}$) and V2 ($a_{1g}^{1\downarrow}e_g^{\prime{1\downarrow}}$,
$S=1$) above $U^c_{eff}\approx3.5$ eV, leading to local spin moments of 2.30

hundredth $\mu_B$. So, the net moment is nearly 1 $\mu_B$ per formula unit,
which is about 2--3 times larger than the experimental value. Our results show
significant variations, strongly depending on the strength of $U_{eff}$, in
energy differences between various magnetic states as well as a small magnetic
anisotropy. These results suggest that the substantial difference between the
calculated and experimental moments is attributed to quantum fluctuation of the

Specifically, we consider a distributionally robust optimization of the
kernel-target alignment with respect to the distribution of training samples
over a distributional ball defined by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The
distributionally robust optimization problem can be recast as a min-max
optimization whose objective function includes a log-sum term. We develop a
mini-batch biased stochastic primal-dual proximal method to solve the min-max
optimization. To debias the minibatch algorithm, we use the Gumbel perturbation
technique to estimate the log-sum term. We establish theoretical guarantees for
the performance of the proposed multiple kernel learning method. In particular,
we prove the consistency, asymptotic normality, stochastic equicontinuity, and
the minimax rate of the empirical estimators. In addition, based on the notion
of Rademacher and Gaussian complexities, we establish distributionally robust
generalization bounds that are tighter than previous known bounds. More
specifically, we leverage matrix concentration inequalities to establish
distributionally robust generalization bounds. We validate our kernel learning
approach for classification with the kernel SVMs on synthetic dataset generated
by sampling multvariate Gaussian distributions with differernt variance
structures. We also apply our kernel learning approach to the MNIST data-set
and evaluate its robustness to perturbation of input images under different
adversarial models. More specifically, we examine the robustness of the
proposed kernel model selection technique against FGSM, PGM, C\&W, and DDN
adversarial perturbations, and compare its performance with alternative
state-of-the-art multiple kernel learning paradigms.

studied using likelihood of adoption when active neighbors expose a user to a
message. The problem arises primarily from the fact that for the most part,
this explicit information of who-exposed-whom among a group of active neighbors
in a social network, before a susceptible node is infected is not available. In
this paper, we attempt to understand the diffusion process through information
cascades by studying the temporal network structure of the cascades. In doing
so, we accommodate the effect of exposures from active neighbors of a node
through a network pruning technique that leverages network motifs to identify
potential infectors responsible for exposures from among those active
neighbors. We attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the components used in
modeling cascade dynamics and especially whether the additional effect of the
exposure information is useful. Following this model, we develop an inference
algorithm namely InferCut, that uses parameters learned from the model and the
exposure information to predict the actual parent node of each potentially
susceptible user in a given cascade. Empirical evaluation on a real world
dataset from Weibo social network demonstrate the significance of incorporating
exposure information in recovering the exact parents of the exposed users at
the early stages of the diffusion process.

implemented by bio-inspired spiking neurons. In the model of spiking neural
networks, network evolves in discrete rounds, where in each round, neurons fire
in pulses in response to a sufficiently high membrane potential. This potential
is induced by spikes from neighboring neurons that fired in the previous round,
which can have either an excitatory or inhibitory effect. We first consider a
deterministic implementation of a neural timer and show that $\Theta(\log t)$
(deterministic) threshold gates are both sufficient and necessary. This raised
the question of whether randomness can be leveraged to reduce the number of
neurons. We answer this question in the affirmative by considering neural
timers with spiking neurons where the neuron $y$ is required to fire for $t$
consecutive rounds with probability at least $1-\delta$, and should stop firing
after at most $2t$ rounds with probability $1-\delta$ for some input parameter
$\delta \in (0,1)$. Our key result is a construction of a neural timer with
$O(\log\log 1/\delta)$ spiking neurons. Interestingly, this construction uses
only one spiking neuron, while the remaining neurons can be deterministic
threshold gates. We complement this construction with a matching lower bound of
$\Omega(\min\{\log\log 1/\delta, \log t\})$ neurons. This provides the first
separation between deterministic and randomized constructions in the setting of
spiking neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of compressed
counting networks for synchronizing neural networks.

search to improve online advertising and increase search revenue. There are two
common challenges in this task. First, the keyword bidding problem: hot ad
keywords are very expensive for most of the advertisers because more
advertisers are bidding on more popular keywords, while unpopular keywords are
difficult to discover. As a result, most ads have few chances to be presented
to the users. Second, the inefficient ad impression issue: a large proportion
of search queries, which are unpopular yet relevant to many ad keywords, have
no ads presented on their search result pages. Existing retrieval-based or
matching-based methods either deteriorate the bidding competition or are unable
to suggest novel keywords to cover more queries, which leads to inefficient ad
impressions. To address the above issues, this work investigates to use
generative neural networks for keyword generation in sponsored search. Given a
purchased keyword (a word sequence) as input, our model can generate a set of
keywords that are not only relevant to the input but also satisfy the domain
constraint which enforces that the domain category of a generated keyword is as
expected. Furthermore, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to
adaptively utilize domain-specific information in keyword generation. Offline
evaluation shows that the proposed model can generate keywords that are
diverse, novel, relevant to the source keyword, and accordant with the domain
constraint. Online evaluation shows that generative models can improve coverage
(COV), click-through rate (CTR), and revenue per mille (RPM) substantially in
sponsored search.

regression in the presence of noise when piecewise continuous nonconvex
penalties are used. Among such penalties, we focus on the SCAD penalty. The
contributions of this study are three-fold: We first present a theoretical
analysis of a typical reconstruction performance, using the replica method,
under the assumption that each component of the design matrix is given as an
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian variable. This
clarifies the superiority of the SCAD estimator compared with $\ell_1$ in a
wide parameter range, although the nonconvex nature of the penalty tends to
lead to solution multiplicity in certain regions. This multiplicity is shown to
be connected to replica symmetry breaking in the spin-glass theory. We also
show that the global minimum of the mean square error between the estimator and
the true signal is located in the replica symmetric phase. Second, we develop
an approximate formula efficiently computing the cross-validation error without
actually conducting the cross-validation, which is also applicable to the
non-i.i.d. design matrices. It is shown that this formula is only applicable to
the unique solution region and tends to be unstable in the multiple solution
region. We implement instability detection procedures, which allows the
approximate formula to stand alone and resultantly enables us to draw phase
diagrams for any specific dataset. Third, we propose an annealing procedure,
called nonconvexity annealing, to obtain the solution path efficiently.
Numerical simulations are conducted on simulated datasets to examine these
results to verify the theoretical results consistency and the approximate
formula efficiency. Another numerical experiment on a real-world dataset is
conducted; its results are consistent with those of earlier studies using the
$\ell_0$ formulation.

Integrate the trained CNN denoisers into project onto convex set (POCS)

end-to-end deep learning on seismic data interpolation. Additionally, the
proposed method is flexible for many cases of traces missing because missing
cases are not involved in the training step, and thus it is of plug-and-play
nature. These indicate the high generalizability of our approach and the
reduction of the need of the problem-specific training. Primary results on
synthetic and field data show promising interpolation performances of the

weak-feature reconstruction, in comparison with traditional $f$-$x$ prediction

are promising candidates within the 5G and beyond systems. This work examines
the benefit of adopting NOMA in an FRAN architecture with constrained capacity
fronthaul. The paper proposes methods for optimizing joint scheduling and power
adaptation in the downlink of a NOMA-based FRAN with multiple resource blocks
(RB). We consider a mixed-integer optimization problem which maximizes a
network-wide rate-based utility function subject to fronthaul-capacity
constraints, so as to determine i) the user-to-RB assignment, ii) the allocated
power to each RB, and iii) the power split levels of the NOMA users in each RB.
The paper proposes a feasible decoupled solution for such non-convex
optimization problem using a three-step hybrid centralized/distributed
approach. The proposed solution complies with FRAN operation that aims to
partially shift the network control to the FAPs, so as to overcome delays due
to fronthaul rate constraints. The paper proposes and compares two distinct
methods for solving the assignment problem, namely the Hungarian method, and
the Multiple Choice Knapsack method. The power allocation and the NOMA power
split optimization, on the other hand, are solved using the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Simulations results illustrate the
advantages of the proposed methods compared to different baseline schemes
including the conventional Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA), for different
utility functions and different network environments.

have enough information to clearly isolate contribution from Hapi and Inhotep
independently, and compare it to the nominal case of activity from the entire
illuminated surface. We also demonstrate that spectral line shapes differ from
the 1D model for different viewing geometries and coma conditions relevant to
this study. Specifically, line shapes are somewhat sensitive to the location of
the terminator in the coma. At last, fitting the MIRO observations we show that
the Imhotep region (possible extended source of H$_{2}$O due to CO$_{2}$
activity) contributes only a small fraction of the total number of water
molecules into MIRO beam in the early activity. On the other hand, a strong
enhancement of water activity from the Hapi region seems required to fit the
MIRO line shapes. This is consistent with earlier Rosetta results.
Nevertheless, within the assumption of our coma and surface boundary
conditions, we cannot get a reasonable fit to all MIRO mapping observations in
July 2014, which may illustrate that a more sophisticated coma model or more

demonstrated for obtaining checks which are sensitive to different aspects of

Low-complexity energy- and cost-efficient communication schemes are essential
to enable large-scale deployments. To target these requirements, we study
decoding of polar codes with coarse quantization in the short block length
regime. In particular, we devise schemes to mitigate the impact of coarse
quantization, which has not been adequately explored in prior works. We
introduce the 3-level quantized successive cancellation (SC) and SC list (SCL)
decoder. Coarse quantization of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) leads to
quantization of path metrics (PMs). Quantized PMs severely impact the list
management of SCL decoders, and hence cause performance degradation. Two
mitigation strategies are presented: 1.) Selecting the winning codeword from
the decoder's list based on maximum-likelihood (ML) rather than PM. 2.)
Utilizing statistical knowledge about the reliability of bit estimates in each
decoding step to improve list management. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our techniques in simulations. In particular, our enhancements prove useful in
the low code rate regime, where theory available in the literature predicts
pronounced losses caused by quantization. Furthermore, we put our work into
perspective by comparing it to finer quantization and partially unquantized
schemes. This yields insights and recommendations as to which quantization
schemes offer the best cost-benefit ratio for practical implementation.

um, 2.80 um x 4.60 um, 2.80 um x 6.95 um, respectively. We used two approaches
to binarization-level-set and binarization-cost-to obtain silicon wavelength
demultiplexer considering fabrication constraints. For instance, the
transmission efficiency of binarization-cost 1x2 demultiplexer was -0.30 dB for
1.31 um and -0.54 dB at 1.55 um while crosstalk at the operating wavelengths
are negligibly small, i.e., -17.80 and -15.29 dB, respectively. Moreover, for
the binarization-cost 1x4 demultiplexer, the transmission efficiency values
were approximately -1.90 dB at 1.31, 1.39, 1.47, and 1.55 um as the crosstalk
was approximately -13 dB. Furthermore, the objective-first algorithm was used
to employ our demultiplexers as multiplexers which means the ports that were
once used as inputs in demultiplexers are designed to be used as outputs. The
inverse design approach that allows for the implementation of more than six
output channels together with the proposed functionalities can help develop
compact and manufacturable 2D 1xN couplers.

Magnetic helicity is an important quantity in studies of magnetized
plasmas as it provides a measure of the geometrical complexity of the magnetic
field in a given volume. A more detailed description of the spatial
distribution of magnetic helicity is given by the field line helicity that
expresses the amount of helicity associated to individual field lines, rather
than in the full analysed volume. Aims. Magnetic helicity is not a
gauge-invariant quantity in general, unless it is computed with respect to a
reference field, yielding the so called relative magnetic helicity. The field
line helicity corresponding to the relative magnetic helicity has only been
examined under specific conditions so far. This work aims to define the field
line helicity corresponding to relative magnetic helicity in the most general
way. In addition to its general form, we provide the expression for the
relative magnetic field line helicity in a few commonly used gauges, and
reproduce known results as a limit of our general formulation. Methods. By
starting from the definition of relative magnetic helicity, we derive the
corresponding field line helicity, and we note the assumptions it is based on.
Results. We check that the developed quantity reproduces relative magnetic
helicity by using three different numerical simulations. For these cases we
also show the morphology of field line helicity in the volume, and on the
photospheric plane. As an application to solar situations, we compare the
morphology of field line helicity on the photosphere with that of the
connectivity-based helicity flux density in two reconstructions of an active
region's magnetic field. We discuss how the derived relative magnetic field
line helicity has a wide range of applications, notably in solar physics and
magnetic reconnection studies.

samplers are often tailored to specific situations and suffer from high

nonlinear state space models with an univariate autoregressive state equation.
For this we employ an interweaving strategy and elliptical slice sampling to

bivariate dynamic copula models. Further we are interested in modeling the
volatility return relationship. Therefore we use the proposed sampler to
estimate the parameters of stochastic volatility models with skew Student t

This model allows for dynamic asymmetric tail dependence. Comparison to

training of question answering, help chatbots to start or continue a
conversation with humans, and provide assessment materials for educational
purposes. Existing neural question generation models are not sufficient mainly
due to their inability to properly model the process of how each word in the
question is selected, i.e., whether repeating the given passage or being
generated from a vocabulary. In this paper, we propose our Clue Guided Copy
Network for Question Generation (CGC-QG), which is a sequence-to-sequence
generative model with copying mechanism, yet employing a variety of novel
components and techniques to boost the performance of question generation. In
CGC-QG, we design a multi-task labeling strategy to identify whether a question
word should be copied from the input passage or be generated instead, guiding
the model to learn the accurate boundaries between copying and generation.
Furthermore, our input passage encoder takes as input, among a diverse range of
other features, the prediction made by a clue word predictor, which helps
identify whether each word in the input passage is a potential clue to be
copied into the target question. The clue word predictor is designed based on a
novel application of Graph Convolutional Networks onto a syntactic dependency
tree representation of each passage, thus being able to predict clue words only
based on their context in the passage and their relative positions to the
answer in the tree. We jointly train the clue prediction as well as question
generation with multi-task learning and a number of practical strategies to
reduce the complexity. Extensive evaluations show that our model significantly
improves the performance of question generation and out-performs all previous
state-of-the-art neural question generation models by a substantial margin.

minimum number of points for each cluster. We experimentally evaluate our
problem formulation and proposed algorithm on datasets inspired by the

mean-field universality class. However, the scaling of the order parameter
exhibits corrections much stronger than those of the Kuramoto model with
all-to-all coupling, making thereby an accurate estimate of the order-parameter

the critical desynchronization dynamics show a non-monotonic approach toward
the asymptotic value. In the light of these results, the technique of

near off-resonance photons in randomly chosen polarization into sender's laser,
where injection locking in a shifted frequency can happen only when Eve's

account for different types of motion that can occur between frames, so that
temporally stable CNNs can be trained without the need for video material or

based methods represent each style with an explicit set of parameters to
perform MST task. However, most existing SEL methods either learn explicit
style representation with numerous independent parameters or learn a relatively
black-box style representation, which makes them difficult to control the
stylized results. In this paper, we outline a novel MST model, StyleRemix, to
compactly and explicitly integrate multiple styles into one network. By
decomposing diverse styles into the same basis, StyleRemix represents a
specific style in a continuous vector space with 1-dimensional coefficients.
With the interpretable style representation, StyleRemix not only enables the
style visualization task but also allows several ways of remixing styles in the
smooth style embedding space.~Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of StyleRemix on various MST tasks compared to state-of-the-art
SEL approaches.

their energy from the local magnetic field and form a major source of local
heating, signatures of which are seen in EUV and X-ray bands. Their radio
emission arise from various plasma instabilities that lead to coherent
radiation, making even a weak flare appear very bright. The radio observations
hence probe non-equilibrium dynamics providing complementary information on
plasma evolution. However, a robust study of radio emission from a weak event
among many simultaneous events, requires high dynamic range imaging at
sub-second andsub-MHz resolutions owing to their high spectro-temporal
variability. Such observations were not possible until recently.This is among
the first spatially resolved studies of an active region loop hosting a
transient brightening (ARTB) and dynamically linked to a metrewave type-I noise
storm. It uses imaging observations at metrewave, EUV and X-ray bands, along
with magnetogram data. We believe this is the first spectroscopic radio imaging
study of a type-I source, the data for which was obtained using the Murchison
Widefield Array. We report the discovery of 30 s quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) in the radio light curve, riding on a coherent baseline flux. The
strength of the QPOs and the baseline flux enhanced during a mircoflare
associated with the ARTB. Our observations suggest a scenario where magnetic
stress builds up over an Alfv\'{e}n timescale (30s) across the typical magnetic
field braiding scale and then dissipates via a cascade of weak reconnection
events.

structures coupling to deformed states but relation between threshold energy

states were observed by a $\gamma$-spectroscopy experiment in $^{35}$Cl but its
detailed structure is unclear. By analyzing coupling of cluster structures in
deformed states and high-lying cluster states in $^{35}$Cl, cluster structures
coupling to deformed states and excitation energy of high-lying cluster states
are investigated. The antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) and the
generator coordinate method (GCM) are used. An AMD wave function is a Slater
determinant of Gaussian wave packets. By energy variational calculations with
constraints on deformation and clustering, wave functions of deformed
structures and $\alpha$- and $t$-cluster structures are obtained. Adopting
those wave functions as GCM basis, wave functions of ground and excited states
are calculated. Various deformed bands are obtained and predicted. A $K^\pi =
\frac{1}{2}^-$ deformed band, which corresponds to the observed SD band,
dominates deformed structure and compact $\alpha$- and $t$-cluster structure
components. Particle-hole configurations of the dominant components with
deformed and cluster structures are similar. In high-lying states, almost pure
$\alpha$- and $t$-cluster states are obtained in negative-parity states, and
excitation energies of the $t$-cluster states are higher than those of
$\alpha$-cluster states. In conclusions, particle-hole configurations of
cluster structure with small intercluster distance are important for coupling
to low-energy deformed states. Threshold energies reflect to excitation
energies of high-lying almost pure cluster states.

the forces in water in two surface configurations: between two rough calcite

nm-scale rough, polycrystalline calcite films prepared by Atomic Layer
Deposition (ALD). We measured only repulsive forces in CC in CaCO$_3$-saturated

Velocity-dependent adhesion forces were measured in monoethylene glycol (MEG)

measured in CM in CaCO$_3$-saturated water depending on the calcite roughness,
and the adhesion was likely enhanced by electrostatic effects. The pull-off
adhesive force in CM became stronger with time and this increase was correlated
with a decrease of roughness at contacts, which parameter could be estimated

mass transport across nm to ${\mu}$m-thick gaps between the surfaces. Major
roughening was observed only for the smoothest calcite films, where the gaps

transforms into stars. Here we present a new VLA map of the spiral galaxy M51
in 33GHz radio continuum, an extinction-free tracer of star formation, at 3""
scales (~100pc). We combined this map with interferometric PdBI/NOEMA
observations of CO(1-0) and HCN(1-0) at matched resolution for three regions in
M51 (central molecular ring, northern and southern spiral arm segments). While
our measurements roughly fall on the well-known correlation between total
infrared and HCN luminosity, bridging the gap between Galactic and
extragalactic observations, we find systematic offsets from that relation for
different dynamical environments probed in M51, e.g. the southern arm segment
is more quiescent due to low star formation efficiency (SFE) of the dense gas,
despite having a high dense gas fraction. Combining our results with
measurements from the literature at 100pc scales, we find that the SFE of the
dense gas and the dense gas fraction anti-correlate and correlate,
respectively, with the local stellar mass surface density. This is consistent
with previous kpc-scale studies. In addition, we find a significant
anti-correlation between the SFE and velocity dispersion of the dense gas.
Finally, we confirm that a correlation also holds between star formation rate
surface density and the dense gas fraction, but it is not stronger than the
correlation with dense gas surface density. Our results are hard to reconcile
with models relying on a universal gas density threshold for star formation and
suggest that turbulence and galactic dynamics play a major role in setting how
efficiently dense gas converts into stars.

  using Regular Polytope (Fixed Classifier) Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural networks are widely used as a model for classification in a large
variety of tasks. Typically, a learnable transformation (i.e. the classifier)
is placed at the end of such models returning a value for each class used for
classification. This transformation plays an important role in determining how
the generated features change during the learning process.
  In this work we argue that this transformation not only can be fixed (i.e.
set as non trainable) with no loss of accuracy, but it can also be used to
learn stationary and maximally discriminative embeddings.
  We show that the stationarity of the embedding and its maximal discriminative
representation can be theoretically justified by setting the weights of the
fixed classifier to values taken from the coordinate vertices of three regular
polytopes available in $\mathbb{R}^d$, namely: the $d$-Simplex, the $d$-Cube
and the $d$-Orthoplex. These regular polytopes have the maximal amount of
symmetry that can be exploited to generate stationary features angularly
centered around their corresponding fixed weights.
  Our approach improves and broadens the concept of a fixed classifier,
recently proposed in \cite{hoffer2018fix}, to a larger class of fixed
classifier models. Experimental results confirm both the theoretical analysis
and the generalization capability of the proposed method.

that corrects the data for systematic errors and in addition, subtracts bright
foreground interference to reveal weak signals hidden in the residual. These
weak and unknown signals are much sought after to reach many science goals but
the effect of calibration on such signals is an ever present concern. The main
reason for this is the incompleteness of the model used in calibration.
Distributed calibration based on consensus optimization has been shown to
mitigate the effect due to model incompleteness by calibrating data covering a
wide bandwidth in a computationally efficient manner. In this paper, we study
the statistical performance of direction dependent distributed calibration,
i.e., the distortion caused by calibration on the residual statistics. In order
to study this, we consider the mapping between the input uncalibrated data and
the output residual data. We derive an analytical relationship for the
influence of the input on the residual and use this to find the relationship
between the input and output probability density functions. Using simulations
we show that the smallest eigenvalue of the Jacobian of this mapping is a
reliable indicator of the statistical performance of calibration. The analysis
developed in this paper can also be applied to other data processing steps in
radio interferometry such as imaging and foreground subtraction as well as to
many other machine learning problems.

afferent sensorimotor and visual information with compensatory neuromuscular
reactions. The objective of this work was to characterize the visual dependency
and functional dynamics of cortical activation during postural control.
Proprioceptic vibratory stimulation of calf muscles at 85 Hz was performed to
evoke postural perturbation in open-eye (OE) and closed-eye (CE) experimental
trials, with pseudorandom binary stimulation phases divided into four segments
of 16 stimuli. 64-channel EEG was recorded; with perturbation epochs defined
using bipolar electrodes placed proximal to each vibrator. Finally, functional
connectivity assessment was explored via network segregation and integration
analyses. Spectra variation showed waveform and vision-dependent activation
within cortical regions specific to both postural adaptation and habituation.
Generalized spectral variation yielded significant shifts from low to high
frequencies in CE adaptation trials, with overall activity suppressed in
habituation; OE trials showed the opposite phenomenon, with both adaptation and
habituation yielding increases in spectral power. Finally, our analysis of
functional dynamics reveals novel cortical networks implicated in postural
control using EEG source-space brain networks. In particular, our reported
significant increase in local theta connectivity may signify the planning of
corrective steps and/or the analysis of falling consequences, while alpha band
network integration results reflect an inhibition of error detection within the
cingulate cortex, likely due to habituation. Our findings suggest that specific
cortical waveforms are dependent upon the availability of visual feedback, and
we present the first evidence that local and global brain networks undergo
characteristic modification during postural control.

growth behaviour of the spectral bound of a family of linear operators along
positive rays. For the specific class of model we consider here, this presents
a considerable challenge. We are going to show that the spectral bound of the

controlled by perturbations in the domain of the generators (only). These new
boundary perturbation results are particularly important for models exhibiting
fertility controlled dynamics. As an important by-product of the application of

computationally efficient and can be proficiently used even on large data sets.
We find that many real-world data sets contain regions with widely
heterogeneous dimensions. These regions host points differing in core
properties: folded vs unfolded configurations in a protein molecular dynamics
trajectory, active vs non-active regions in brain imaging data, and firms with
different financial risk in company balance sheets. A simple topological

Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), is the recovery of finer texture details
when super-resolving at large upscaling factors. This issue is particularly
related to the choice of the objective loss function. In particular, recent
works proposed the use of a VGG loss which consists in minimizing the error
between the generated high resolution images and ground-truth in the feature
space of a Convolutional Neural Network (VGG19), pre-trained on the very
""large"" ImageNet dataset. When considering the problem of super-resolving
images with a distribution ""far"" from the ImageNet images distribution
(\textit{e.g.,} satellite images), their proposed \textit{fixed} VGG loss is no
longer relevant. In this paper, we present a general framework named
\textit{Generative Collaborative Networks} (GCN), where the idea consists in
optimizing the \textit{generator} (the mapping of interest) in the feature
space of a \textit{features extractor} network. The two networks (generator and
extractor) are \textit{collaborative} in the sense that the latter ""helps"" the
former, by constructing discriminative and relevant features (not necessarily
\textit{fixed} and possibly learned \textit{mutually} with the generator). We
evaluate the GCN framework in the context of SISR, and we show that it results
in a method that is adapted to super-resolution domains that are ""far"" from the

solution to the equations of highly viscous flow due to a spatially-smoothed
concentrated force, is widely employed in biological fluid mechanics. Many
problems of interest are axisymmetric, motivating the study of the
azimuthally-integrated form of the Stokeslet which physically corresponds to a
ring of smoothed forces. The regularized fundamental solution for the velocity
(single layer potential) and stress (double layer potential) due to an
axisymmetric ring of smoothed point forces, the `regularized ringlet', is
derived in terms of complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind.
The relative errors in the total drag and surrounding fluid velocity for the
resistance problem on the translating, rotating unit sphere, as well as the
condition number of the underlying resistance matrix, are calculated; the
regularized method is also compared to 3D regularized Stokeslets, and the
singular method of fundamental solutions. The velocity of Purcell's toroidal
swimmer is calculated; regularized ringlets enable accurate evaluation of
surface forces and propulsion speeds for non-slender tori. The benefits of
regularization are illustrated by a model of the internal cytosolic fluid
velocity profile in the rapidly-growing pollen tube. Actomyosin transport of
vesicles in the tube is modelled using forces immersed in the fluid, from which
it is found that transport along the central actin bundle is essential for
experimentally-observed flow speeds to be attained. The effect of tube growth
speed on the internal cytosolic velocity is also considered. For axisymmetric
problems, the regularized ringlet method exhibits a comparable accuracy to the
method of fundamental solutions whilst also allowing for the placement of
forces inside of the fluid domain and having more satisfactory convergence
properties.

framework to decrease the amount of supervision in the existing learning
algorithms. But for a successful knowledge transfer, the learner needs to
remember how to perform previous tasks. One way to endow the learner the
ability to perform tasks seen in the past is to store a small memory, dubbed
episodic memory, that stores few examples from previous tasks and then to
replay these examples when training for future tasks. In this work, we
empirically analyze the effectiveness of a very small episodic memory in a CL
setup where each training example is only seen once. Surprisingly, across four
rather different supervised learning benchmarks adapted to CL, a very simple
baseline, that jointly trains on both examples from the current task as well as
examples stored in the episodic memory, significantly outperforms specifically
designed CL approaches with and without episodic memory. Interestingly, we find
that repetitive training on even tiny memories of past tasks does not harm
generalization, on the contrary, it improves it, with gains between 7\% and
17\% when the memory is populated with a single example per class.

  This puzzle is exacerbated by the discovery of a very large but barely
visible, dark matter dominated galaxy Antlia II orbiting the Milky Way,
uncovered by tracking star motions with the {\t Gaia} satellite. Although
Antlia II has a low mass, its visible radius is more than double any known
dwarf galaxy, with an unprecedentedly low density core. We show that Antlia II
favors dark matter as a Bose-Einstein condensate, for which the ground state is
a stable soliton with a core radius given by the de Broglie wavelength. The
lower the galaxy mass, the larger the de Broglie wavelength, so the least
massive galaxies should have the widest soliton cores of lowest density. An
ultra-light boson of $m_\psi \sim 1.1 \times10^{-22}$ eV, accounts well for the
large size and slowly moving stars within Antlia II, and agrees with boson mass
estimates derived from the denser cores of more massive dwarf galaxies. For
this very light boson, Antlia II is close to the lower limiting Jeans scale for
galaxy formation permitted by the Uncertainty Principle, so other examples are
expected but none significantly larger in size. This simple explanation for the
puzzling dark cores of dwarf galaxies implies dark matter as an ultra-light
boson, such as an axion generic in String Theory.

paradigm with many interesting problems and applications. The problem of
dispersion in this context, introduced by Augustine and Moses Jr., asks that
$n$ robots, initially placed arbitrarily on an $n$ node graph, work together to
quickly reach a configuration with exactly one robot at each node. Previous
work on this problem has looked at the trade-off between the time to achieve
dispersion and the amount of memory required by each robot. However, the
trade-off was analyzed for \textit{deterministic algorithms} and the minimum
memory required to achieve dispersion was found to be $\Omega(\log n)$ bits at
each robot. In this paper, we show that by harnessing the power of
\textit{randomness}, one can achieve dispersion with $O(\log \Delta)$ bits of
memory at each robot, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph.
Furthermore, we show a matching lower bound of $\Omega(\log \Delta)$ bits for
any \textit{randomized algorithm} to solve dispersion.
  We further extend the problem to a general $k$-dispersion problem where $k>
n$ robots need to disperse over $n$ nodes such that at most $\lceil k/n \rceil$
robots are at each node in the final configuration.

every observation to belong to more than one species, now called features.
Under the popular Bernoulli product model for feature allocation, given $n$
samples, we study the problem of estimating the missing mass $M_{n}$, namely
the expected number hitherto unseen features that would be observed if one
additional individual was sampled. This is motivated by numerous applied
problems where the sampling procedure is expensive, in terms of time and/or
financial resources allocated, and further samples can be only motivated by the
possibility of recording new unobserved features. We introduce a simple, robust
and theoretically sound nonparametric estimator $\hat{M}_{n}$ of $M_{n}$.
$\hat{M}_{n}$ turns out to have the same analytic form of the popular
Good-Turing estimator of the missing mass in species sampling models, with the
difference that the two estimators have different ranges. We show that
$\hat{M}_{n}$ admits a natural interpretation both as a jackknife estimator and
as a nonparametric empirical Bayes estimator, we give provable guarantees for
the performance of $\hat{M}_{n}$ in terms of minimax rate optimality, and we
provide with an interesting connection between $\hat{M}_{n}$ and the
Good-Turing estimator for species sampling. Finally, we derive non-asymptotic
confidence intervals for $\hat{M}_{n}$, which are easily computable and do not
rely on any asymptotic approximation. Our approach is illustrated with

of two partially overlapping skyrmions has brought about great research
interest. Since for its formation the individual skyrmions need to posses

many variants (i.e., different car models and their versions). With such

there is an effort to keep the variants as close as possible. This simple
requirement forms a big challenge in the area of communication protocols. When
several vehicle variants use the same signal, it is often required to
simultaneously schedule such a signal in all vehicle variants. Furthermore, new
vehicle variants are designed incrementally in such a way as to maintain
backward compatibility with the older vehicles. Backward compatibility of
time-triggered schedules reduces expenses relating to testing and fine-tuning
of the components that interact with physical environment (e.g.,
electromagnetic compatibility issues). As this requirement provides for using
the same platform, it simplifies signal traceability and diagnostics, across
different vehicle variants, besides simplifying the reuse of components and
tools.
  This paper proposes an efficient and robust heuristic algorithm, which
creates the schedules for internal communication of new vehicle variants. The
algorithm provides for variant management by ensuring compatibility among the
new variants, besides preserving backward compatibility with the preceding
vehicle variants. Based on the results of the proposed algorithm, the impact of
maintaining compatibility among new variants and of preserving backward
compatibility with the preceding variants on the scheduling procedure is
examined and discussed. Thanks to the execution time of the algorithm, which is
less than one second, the network parameters like the frame length and cycle
duration are explored to find their best choice concerning the schedule

applications. But the restriction of computational resources renders such

Model order reduction (MOR) is used to tackle this issue. Recently, MOR is
extended to preserve specific structures of the model throughout the reduction,
e.g. structure-preserving MOR for Hamiltonian systems. This is referred to as
symplectic MOR. It is based on the classical projection-based MOR and uses a
symplectic reduced order basis (ROB). Such a ROB can be derived in a
data-driven manner with the Proper Symplectic Decomposition (PSD) in the form
of a minimization problem. Due to the strong nonlinearity of the minimization

we show that current solution procedures almost exclusively yield suboptimal

contribution, we propose a new method which eliminates this restriction by
generating non-orthonormal ROBs. In the numerical experiments, we examine the

quantification (UQ) is the development of efficient methods for the
construction of accurate surrogate models. Such efforts are particularly
important to applications constrained by high-dimensional uncertain parameter
spaces. The difficulty of accurate surrogate modeling in such systems, is
further compounded by data scarcity brought about by the large cost of forward
model evaluations. Traditional response surface techniques, such as Gaussian
process regression (or Kriging) and polynomial chaos are difficult to scale to
high dimensions. To make surrogate modeling tractable in expensive
high-dimensional systems, one must resort to dimensionality reduction of the
stochastic parameter space. A recent dimensionality reduction technique that
has shown great promise is the method of `active subspaces'. The classical
formulation of active subspaces, unfortunately, requires gradient information
from the forward model - often impossible to obtain. In this work, we present a
simple, scalable method for recovering active subspaces in high-dimensional
stochastic systems, without gradient-information that relies on a
reparameterization of the orthogonal active subspace projection matrix, and
couple this formulation with deep neural networks. We demonstrate our approach
on synthetic and real world datasets and show favorable predictive comparison

$F_{j}$ with an unknown probability $p_{j}$. A statistical problem inherent to

actions of finitely generated groups have finite Rokhlin entropy if and only if
their derived $\mathrm L^1$ full group has finite topological rank. We further
show that a graphing is amenable if and only if its $\mathrm L^1$ full group
is, and explain why various examples of (derived) $\mathrm L^1$ full groups fit
very well into Rosendal's geometric framework for Polish groups. As an
application, we obtain that every abstract group isomorphism between $\mathrm
L^1$ full groups of amenable ergodic graphings must be a quasi-isometry for
their respective $\mathrm L^1$ metrics. We finally show that $\mathrm L^1$ full
groups of rank one transformations have topological rank 2.

that will scan the sky for 5 years in 21 frequency bands spread between 21 and
799 GHz. It will produce full-sky surveys of intensity and polarization with a
final combined-map noise level of 0.87 $\mu$K arcmin for the required
specifications, equivalent to 3300 Planck missions, and with our current
best-estimate would have a noise level of 0.61 $\mu$K arcmin (6400 Planck
missions). PICO will either determine the energy scale of inflation by
detecting the tensor to scalar ratio at a level $r=5\times 10^{-4}~(5\sigma)$,
or will rule out with more than $5\sigma$ all inflation models for which the
characteristic scale in the potential is the Planck scale. With LSST's data it
could rule out all models of slow-roll inflation. PICO will detect the sum of
neutrino masses at $>4\sigma$, constrain the effective number of light particle
species with $\Delta N_{\rm eff}<0.06~(2\sigma)$, and elucidate processes
affecting the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring the optical depth to
reionization with errors limited by cosmic variance and by constraining the
evolution of the amplitude of linear fluctuations $\sigma_{8}(z)$ with
sub-percent accuracy. Cross-correlating PICO's map of the thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect with LSST's gold sample of galaxies will precisely
trace the evolution of thermal pressure with $z$. PICO's maps of the Milky Way
will be used to determine the make up of galactic dust and the role of magnetic
fields in star formation efficiency. With 21 full sky legacy maps in intensity
and polarization, which cannot be obtained in any other way, the mission will
enrich many areas of astrophysics. PICO is the only single-platform instrument
with the combination of sensitivity, angular resolution, frequency bands, and
control of systematic effects that can deliver this compelling, timely, and
broad science.

way to improve crop production without increasing agricultural inputs. To
design optimal crop mixtures, choices of species, genotypes, sowing proportion,
plant arrangement, and sowing date need to be made but field experiments alone
are not sufficient to explore such a large range of factors. Crop modeling
allows to study, understand and ultimately design cropping systems and is an
established method for sole crops. Recently, modeling started to be applied to
annual crop mixtures as well. Here, we review to what extent crop simulation
models and individual-based models are suitable to capture and predict the
specificities of annual crop mixtures. We argued that: 1) The crop mixture
spatio-temporal heterogeneity (influencing the occurrence of ecological
processes) determines the choice of the modeling approach (plant or crop
centered). 2) Only few crop models (adapted from sole crop models) and
individual-based models currently exist to simulate annual crop mixtures. 3)
Crop models are mainly used to address issues related to crop mixtures
management and to the integration of crop mixtures into larger scales such as
the rotation, whereas individual-based models are mainly used to identify plant
traits involved in crop mixture performance and to quantify the relative
contribution of the different ecological processes (niche complementarity,
facilitation, competition, plasticity) to crop mixture functioning. This review
highlights that modeling of annual crop mixtures is in its infancy and gives to
model users some important keys to choose the model based on the questions they
want to answer, with awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the
modeling approaches.

can further help in scaling down of the memory device. It is also observed that
the device with such anti-reflection units exhibits 32$\%$ lesser RESET voltage

proposed that allow to select sets of jointly acceptable arguments from a given
argumentation framework, i.e. based only on the attack relation between
arguments. The existence of multiple argumentation semantics raises the
question which of these semantics predicts best how humans evaluate arguments.
Previous empirical cognitive studies that have tested how humans evaluate sets
of arguments depending on the attack relation between them have been limited to
a small set of very simple argumentation frameworks, so that some semantics
studied in the literature could not be meaningfully distinguished by these
studies. In this paper we report on an empirical cognitive study that overcomes
these limitations by taking into consideration twelve argumentation frameworks
of three to eight arguments each. These argumentation frameworks were mostly
more complex than the argumentation frameworks considered in previous studies.
All twelve argumentation framework were systematically instantiated with
natural language arguments based on a certain fictional scenario, and
participants were shown both the natural language arguments and a graphical
depiction of the attack relation between them. Our data shows that grounded and
CF2 semantics were the best predictors of human argument evaluation. A detailed
analysis revealed that part of the participants chose a cognitively simpler
strategy that is predicted very well by grounded semantics, while another part
of the participants chose a cognitively more demanding strategy that is mostly
predicted well by CF2 semantics.

quantized zero-bias conductance peak(ZBCP) which is robust to scattering by
impurities, a consequence of its topological protection. In this work we
examine the stability of this MBS induced ZBCP in a metal-superconductor
junction in the vicinity of a spin flipper. We analytically calculate the
differential charge conductance for metal-spin flipper-superconductor junction
with two distinct superconductors: (a) spin less $p$-wave superconductor(pSc)
and (b) spin-orbit-coupled s-wave superconducting wire in presence of a Zeeman
field(SOCSW). We see that the quantized ZBCP remains stable in presence of
spin-flip(SF) scattering for metal-pSc junction, while it loses its stability
when pSc is replaced by SOCSW. Further, the scattering matrix(S-Matrix) of the
metal-pSc junction satisfies BDI symmetry class regardless of SF scattering.
For BDI symmetry class, both Hamiltonian as well as S-Matrix satisfy
particle-hole(PH), time reversal(TR) and chiral symmetries. However, in case of
metal-SOCSW junction the Hamiltonian as well as S-Matrix belongs to symmetry
class D in absence of SF scattering. In symmetry class D both Hamiltonian and
S-Matrix satisfy PH symmetry, but do not satisfy TR and chiral symmetry
relations. In presence of SF scattering, the S-Matrix for metal-SOCSW junction
belongs to symmetry class A for which S-Matrix does not satisfy either PH or TR
or chiral symmetry relations. The reason for ZBCP at a metal-pSc junction is
perfect Andreev reflection regardless of SF scattering, while for metal-SOCSW
junction it is the exact cancellation between normal and Andreev reflection
probabilities at zero bias and not perfect Andreev reflection, in absence of SF
scattering. However, in presence of SF scattering, there is no exact
cancellation at zero bias which leads to loss of quantized ZBCP for a
metal-SOCSW junction.

foil that enables a controlled discharge position and the induction of primary
discharge with an over-voltage in the THGEM foil has been used in the initial
DP measurements. In order to justify the use of a custom-made THGEM foil,
additional measurements were made with a standard GEM foil. Correlated optical
(with an ordinary SLR and a high-speed camera) and electrical measurements of
the delayed DP were made for Ne-CO$_2$-N$_2$ (90-10-5) mixture and with
different powering configurations. Measurements show that the delayed DP
happens without a drift field, with an inverted induction field, inverted THGEM
voltages or an inverted drift field. After the primary discharge, there is a
charge transfer in the induction region at an induction field value below that
of the onset field for DP. In the time between the primary discharge and the
delayed DP, three different current regimes are observed, which suggests
multiple charge transfer mechanisms in the induction region. High-speed camera
recordings provide valuable insight into the time evolution of the primary and
the delayed DP, especially when correlated with electrical measurements.

microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data access

understand the key properties of atomic nuclei. A deep understanding of the
explicit role of quarks and gluons in nuclei remains elusive however, as these
effects have thus far been well-disguised by confinement effects in QCD which
are encapsulated by a successful description in terms of effective hadronic
degrees of freedom. The observation of the EMC effect has provided an enduring
indication for explicit QCD effects in nuclei, and points to the medium
modification of the bound protons and neutrons in the nuclear medium.
Understanding the EMC effect is a major challenge for modern nuclear physics,
and several key questions remain, such as understanding its flavor, spin, and
momentum dependence. This manuscript provides a contemporary snapshot of our
understanding of the role of QCD in nuclei and outlines possible pathways in
experiment and theory that will help deepen our understanding of nuclei in the

utilizes road markings that are commonly captured by the two sensor modalities

demonstrated experimentally, the amplitudes of the noise terms therein, which
stem from fluctuations of the rotary motors, depend on the flagella length.
Here we address the conceptually important question which kind of synchrony
occurs if the two flagella have different lengths such that the noises acting
on each of them have different amplitudes. On the basis of a minimal model,
too, we show that a different kind of synchrony emerges, and here it is
mediated by a current carrying, steady-state; it manifests itself via
correlated ""drifts"" of phases. We quantify such a synchronization mechanism in
terms of appropriate order parameters $Q$ and $Q_{\cal S}$ - for an ensemble of
trajectories and for a single realization of noises of duration ${\cal S}$,
respectively. Via numerical simulations we show that both approaches become
identical for long observation times ${\cal S}$. This reveals an ergodic
behavior and implies that a single-realization order parameter $Q_{\cal S}$ is
suitable for experimental analysis for which ensemble averaging is not always

massive stars are scarcer in (close) short-period binaries, as reported by the

birth to isolated stars and binaries are commonly invoked. In addition, we
propose that the observed lower magnetic incidence in close binaries may be due
to nonlinear tides. Indeed, close binaries are probably prone to tidal
instability, a fluid instability growing upon the equilibrium tidal flow via
nonlinear effects. Yet, stratified effects have hitherto been largely
overlooked. We theoretically and numerically investigate tidal instability in
rapidly rotating, stably stratified fluids permeated by magnetic fields. We use
the short-wavelength stability method to propose a comprehensive (local) theory
of tidal instability at the linear onset, discussing damping effects. Then, we
propose a mixing-length theory for the mixing generated by tidal instability in
the nonlinear regime. We successfully assess our theoretical predictions
against proof-of-concept, direct numerical simulations. Finally, we compare our
predictions with the observations of short-period, double-lined spectroscopic
binary systems. Using new analytical results, cross-validated by a direct
integration of the stability equations, we show that tidal instability can be
generated by nonlinear couplings of inertia-gravity waves with the equilibrium
tidal flow in short-period massive binaries, even against the Joule diffusion.
In the nonlinear regime, a fossil magnetic field can be dissipated by the
turbulent magnetic diffusion induced by the saturated tidal flows. We predict
that the turbulent Joule diffusion of fossil fields would occur in a few
million years for several short-period massive binaries. Therefore, turbulent
tidal flows could explain the observed dearth of some short-period magnetic
binaries.

$\text{IMQ}(K)$ is isomorphic to the core quandle of the homology group
$H_1(X_2)$, where $X_2$ is the cyclic double cover of $\mathbb S ^3$, branched

(DCM) and Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) to characterise inter-subject
variability in neural circuitry (effective connectivity). This involves
specifying a hierarchical model with two or more levels. At the first level,
state space models (DCMs) are used to infer the effective connectivity that
best explains a subject's neuroimaging timeseries (e.g. fMRI, MEG, EEG).
Subject-specific connectivity parameters are then taken to the group level,
where they are modelled using a General Linear Model (GLM) that partitions
between-subject variability into designed effects and additive random effects.
The ensuing (Bayesian) hierarchical model conveys both the estimated connection
strengths and their uncertainty (i.e., posterior covariance) from the subject
to the group level; enabling hypotheses to be tested about the commonalities
and differences across subjects. This approach can also finesse parameter
estimation at the subject level, by using the group-level parameters as
empirical priors. We walk through this approach in detail, using data from a
published fMRI experiment that characterised individual differences in
hemispheric lateralization in a semantic processing task. The preliminary
subject specific DCM analysis is covered in detail in a companion paper. This

future global climatic and socioeconomic changes. Here, we propose a modeling
framework based in statistical learning theory for predicting the

predictive models were built and tested on six Midwestern cities. The results
showed that water use was better predicted than electricity use, indicating
that water use is slightly more sensitive to climate than electricity use.
Additionally, the results demonstrated the importance of the variability in the
El Nino/Southern Oscillation index, which explained the majority of the
covariance in the water-electricity nexus. Our modeling results suggest that
stronger El Ninos lead to an overall increase in water and electricity use in
these cities. The integrated modeling framework presented here can be used to
characterize the climate-related sensitivity of the water-electricity demand
nexus, accounting for the coupled water and electricity use rather than
modeling them separately, as independent variables.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1711.00131",,,,"cs.IT cs.ET math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper focuses on molecular communication (MC) systems using two types of
signaling molecules which may participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction
in the channel. The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can
realize the concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which
leads to favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction
and avoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of signaling
molecules into the channel. This work first presents a general formulation for
binary modulation schemes that employ two types of signaling molecules and
proposes several modulation schemes as special cases. Moreover, two types of
receivers are considered: a receiver that is able to observe both types of
signaling molecules (2TM), and a simpler receiver that can observe only one
type of signaling molecules (1TM). For both of these receivers, the maximum
likelihood (ML) detector for general binary modulation is derived under the
assumption that the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI-causing sequence.
In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different complexity are proposed,
namely an ML-based detector that employs an estimate of the ISI-causing
sequence and a detector that neglects the effect of ISI. The proposed
detectors, except for the detector that neglects ISI for the 2TM receiver,
require knowledge of the channel response (CR) of the considered MC system.
Moreover, the CR is needed for performance evaluation of all proposed
detectors. However, deriving the CR of MC systems with reactive signaling
molecules is challenging since the underlying partial differential equations
that describe the reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear.
Therefore, we develop an algorithm for efficient computation of the CR and
validate its accuracy via particle-based simulation.

new types of GANs are emerging fast, the generalization ability of forensics
models to detect new types of GAN images is absolutely an essential research
topic. In this paper, we explore this problem and propose to use preprocessed

preprocessing to both real and fake training images, the forensics model is
forced to learn more intrinsic features to classify the generated and real face
images. Our experimental results also prove the effectiveness of the proposed

multi-fidelity data. It is comprised of three NNs, with the first NN trained
using the low-fidelity data and coupled to two high-fidelity NNs, one with
activation functions and another one without, in order to discover and exploit
nonlinear and linear correlations, respectively, between the low-fidelity and
the high-fidelity data. We first demonstrate the accuracy of the new
multi-fidelity NN for approximating some standard benchmark functions but also
a 20-dimensional function. Subsequently, we extend the recently developed
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to be trained with multi-fidelity data
sets (MPINNs). MPINNs contain four fully-connected neural networks, where the
first one approximates the low-fidelity data, while the second and third
construct the correlation between the low- and high-fidelity data and produce
the multi-fidelity approximation, which is then used in the last NN that
encodes the partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, in the two
high-fidelity NNs a relaxation parameter is introduced, which can be optimized
to combine the linear and nonlinear sub-networks. By optimizing this parameter,
the present model is capable of learning both the linear and complex nonlinear
correlations between the low- and high-fidelity data adaptively. By training
the MPINNs, we can:(1) obtain the correlation between the low- and
high-fidelity data, (2) infer the quantities of interest based on a few
scattered data, and (3) identify the unknown parameters in the PDEs. In
particular, we employ the MPINNs to learn the hydraulic conductivity field for
unsaturated flows as well as the reactive models for reactive transport. The
results demonstrate that MPINNs can achieve relatively high accuracy based on a
very small set of high-fidelity data.

show that separating these two formulations helps demonstrate some of the
fundamental differences between structural subtyping, predominant in functional
programming languages, and nominal subtyping, predominant in object-oriented
programming languages---including differences concerning type negation and
concerning the existence of inductive types, of coinductive types, and of

  the Association for Computational Linguistics June 2-7, 2019 Minneapolis, USA",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  On the one hand, nowadays, fake news articles are easily propagated through
various online media platforms and have become a grand threat to the
trustworthiness of information. On the other hand, our understanding of the
language of fake news is still minimal. Incorporating hierarchical
discourse-level structure of fake and real news articles is one crucial step
toward a better understanding of how these articles are structured.
Nevertheless, this has rarely been investigated in the fake news detection
domain and faces tremendous challenges. First, existing methods for capturing
discourse-level structure rely on annotated corpora which are not available for
fake news datasets. Second, how to extract out useful information from such
discovered structures is another challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Discourse-level Structure for Fake news detection. HDSF
learns and constructs a discourse-level structure for fake/real news articles
in an automated and data-driven manner. Moreover, we identify insightful
structure-related properties, which can explain the discovered structures and
boost our understating of fake news. Conducted experiments show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. Further structural analysis suggests
that real and fake news present substantial differences in the hierarchical
discourse-level structures.

constrained optimization problems (DCOPs) as a common area of research in
evolutionary optimization. Current benchmarks proposed for testing these
problems in the continuous spaces are either not scalable in problem dimension
or the settings for the environmental changes are not flexible. Moreover, they
mainly focus on non-linear environmental changes on the objective function.
While the dynamism in some real-world problems exists in the constraints and
can be emulated with linear constraint changes. The purpose of this paper is to
introduce a framework which produces benchmarks in which a dynamic environment
is created with simple changes in linear constraints (rotation and translation
of constraint's hyperplane). Our proposed framework creates dynamic benchmarks
that are flexible in terms of number of changes, dimension of the problem and
can be applied to test any objective function. Different constraint handling
techniques will then be used to compare with our benchmark. The results reveal
that with these changes set, there was an observable effect on the performance
of the constraint handling techniques.

considered implausible from a biological perspective. Numerous recent
publications suggest elaborate models for biologically plausible variants of
deep learning, typically defining success as reaching around 98% test accuracy
on the MNIST data set. Here, we investigate how far we can go on digit (MNIST)
and object (CIFAR10) classification with biologically plausible, local learning
rules in a network with one hidden layer and a single readout layer. The hidden
layer weights are either fixed (random or random Gabor filters) or trained with
unsupervised methods (PCA, ICA or Sparse Coding) that can be implemented by
local learning rules. The readout layer is trained with a supervised, local
learning rule. We first implement these models with rate neurons. This
comparison reveals, first, that unsupervised learning does not lead to better
performance than fixed random projections or Gabor filters for large hidden
layers. Second, networks with localized receptive fields perform significantly
better than networks with all-to-all connectivity and can reach backpropagation
performance on MNIST. We then implement two of the networks - fixed, localized,
random & random Gabor filters in the hidden layer - with spiking leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons and spike timing dependent plasticity to train the
readout layer. These spiking models achieve > 98.2% test accuracy on MNIST,
which is close to the performance of rate networks with one hidden layer
trained with backpropagation. The performance of our shallow network models is
comparable to most current biologically plausible models of deep learning.
Furthermore, our results with a shallow spiking network provide an important
reference and suggest the use of datasets other than MNIST for testing the
performance of future models of biologically plausible deep learning.
