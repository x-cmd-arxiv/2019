overlooked because it is considered sub-optimal in comparison with the lensing
shear. Thanks to the demonstrated optimal characteristics of the sub-millimetre
galaxies (SMGs) for lensing analysis, in this work we were able to measure the
magnification bias produced by a sample of QSOs acting as lenses, $0.2<z<1.0$,
on the SMGs observed by Herschel at $1.2<z<4.0$. Two different methodologies
were successfully applied: the traditional cross-correlation function approach
and the Davis-Peebles estimator through stacking technique. The second one was
found to be more robust for analysing the strong lensing regime ($<20-30$
arcsec in our case) and provides the possibility to take into account the
positional errors of the sources in our samples. From the halo modelling of the
cross-correlation function, the halo mass where the QSOs acting as lenses are
located was estimated to be greater than $\log_{10}{(M_{min}/M_\odot)} >
13.6_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$, also confirmed by the mass density profile analysis
($M_{200c}\sim 10^{14} M_\odot$). These mass values indicate that we are
observing the lensing effect of a cluster size halo signposted by the QSOs, as
in previous studies of the magnification bias. Moreover, we were able to
estimate the lensing convergence, $\kappa(\theta)$, for our magnification bias
measurements down to a few kpcs. The derived mass density profile is in good
agreement with a Navarro-Frank-White (NFW) profile. We also attempt an
estimation of the halo mass and the concentration parameters, obtaining
$M_{NFW}=1.0^{+0.4}_{-0.2}\times10^{14} M_\odot$ and $C=3.5_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$.
This concentration value is rather low and it would indicate that the cluster
halos around these QSOs are unrelaxed. However, higher concentration values
still provides a compatible fit to the data.

brought Optimal Transport (OT) theory into GANs, by minimizing the

objective function. Since then, WGANs have gained considerable interest due to
their stability and theoretical framework. We contribute to the WGAN literature
by introducing the family of $(q,p)$-Wasserstein GANs, which allow the use of
more general $p$-Wasserstein metrics for $p\geq 1$ in the GAN learning
procedure. While the method is able to incorporate any cost function as the
ground metric, we focus on studying the $l^q$ metrics for $q\geq 1$. This is a
notable generalization as in the WGAN literature the OT distances are commonly
based on the $l^2$ ground metric. We demonstrate the effect of different
$p$-Wasserstein distances in two toy examples. Furthermore, we show that the
ground metric does make a difference, by comparing different $(q,p)$ pairs on

(with a size ratio of 1) and showed that the polymeric and colloidal responses
can be decoupled. The adopted experimental protocol involved probing the linear
chain dynamics in different star environments. To this end, we studied mixtures
with different star mass fraction, which was kept constant while linear chains
were added and their entanglement plateau modulus ($G_p$) and terminal
relaxation time ($\tau_d$) were measured as functions of their concentration.
Two distinct scaling regimes were observed for both $G_p$ and $\tau_d$: at low
linear polymer concentrations, a weak concentration dependence was observed,
that became even weaker as the fraction of stars in the mixtures increased into
the star glassy regime. On the other hand, at higher linear polymer
concentrations, the classical entangled polymer scaling was recovered. Simple
scaling arguments show that the threshold crossover concentration between the
two regimes corresponds to the maximum osmotic star compression and signals the
transition from confined to bulk dynamics. These results provide the needed
ingredients to complete the state diagram of soft colloid-polymer mixtures and
investigate their dynamics at large polymer-colloid size ratios. They also
offer an alternative way to explore aspects of the colloidal glass transition

multiplier are naturally linked to square function and vector-valued estimates
for directional singular integrals. The latter are usually referred to as
Meyer-type lemmas and are traditionally attacked by combining weighted
inequalities with sharp estimates for maximal directional averaging operators.
This classical approach fails to give sharp bounds. In this article we develop
a novel framework for square function estimates, based on directional Carleson
embedding theorems and multi-parameter time-frequency analysis, which overcomes
the limitations of weighted theory. In particular we prove the sharp form of
Meyer's lemma, namely a sharp operator norm bound for vector-valued directional
singular integrals, in both one and two parameters, in terms of the cardinality
of the given set of directions. Our sharp Meyer lemma implies an improved
quantification of the reverse square function estimate for tangential
$\delta\times \delta^2$-caps on $\mathbb S^1$. We also prove sharp square
function estimates for conical and radial multipliers. A suitable combination
of these estimates yields a new and currently best known bound for the Fourier
restriction to a $N$-gon, improving on previous results of A. C\'ordoba.

beam pattern. We perform comprehensive experiments with commercial
off-the-shelf mmWave devices to validate the reliability performance of our
proposed method under various scenarios. We also compare our beam pattern

the environment are costly and a good simulator of the environment is not
available. Further, as environments differ by application, the optimal
inductive bias (architecture, hyperparameters, etc.) of a reinforcement agent
depends on the application. In this work, we propose a multi-arm bandit
framework that selects from a set of different reinforcement learning agents to
choose the one with the best inductive bias. To alleviate the problem of sparse
rewards, the reinforcement learning agents are augmented with surrogate
rewards. This helps the bandit framework to select the best agents early, since
these rewards are smoother and less sparse than the environment reward. The
bandit has the double objective of maximizing the reward while the agents are
learning and selecting the best agent after a finite number of learning steps.
Our experimental results on standard environments show that the proposed
framework is able to consistently select the optimal agent after a finite
number of steps, while collecting more cumulative reward compared to selecting
a sub-optimal architecture or uniformly alternating between different agents.

dark matter is non-Gaussian on small scales. However, observations are
typically evaluated through the two-point correlation function of galaxy shear,
which does not capture non-Gaussian features of the lensing maps. Previous
studies attempted to extract non-Gaussian information from weak lensing
observations through several higher-order statistics such as the three-point
correlation function, peak counts or Minkowski-functionals. Deep convolutional

success, and they offer a new and very promising framework to extract

ray-tracing, at angular scales and shape noise levels relevant for future
observations. In a scenario mimicking LSST or Euclid, the CNN yields 2.4-2.8

This is in sharp contrast with previous asymptotic analyses of gradient solids,
where elastic strains were neglected. The presence of an elastic singularity at
the crack tip generates stresses which are sufficiently high to activate
quasi-cleavage. For the long crack case, crack growth resistance curves are

strength. Remarkably, this feature of an elastic singularity is preserved for
short cracks, leading to a severe reduction in tensile ductility. In
qualitative terms, these predictions resemble those of discrete dislocation

$(A,\Phi,\Psi)$ where $A$ is a unital ring and $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ are two formal
power series in $2$ variables ${\Phi(x,y),\Psi(x,y)\in A\llbracket
x,y\rrbracket}$, the first one defining a one-dimensional formal group law over
$A$ and the second one providing a second composition law satisfying axiomatic
properties of compatibility with the first one. For a characteristic-zero ring
$A$, a large class of one-dimensional formal rings can be obtained by
constructing a new composition law, defined in terms of the group logarithm
associated with a given formal group law $\Phi(x,y)$, and associative and
distributive with respect to it. A natural $n$-dimensional generalization of
the previous construction is also proposed; curves on $n$-dimensional formal
rings are introduced. The higher-dimensional theory allows us to define a
generalization of the ring $W(A)$ of Witt vectors over a ring $A$, which is
recovered by means of a specific choice of the associated group logarithm. The
composition laws of our generalized Witt ring are defined in terms of an
underlying formal ring structure. Examples of formal rings related to
Hirzebruch's theory of genera are explicitly computed. Finally, we also propose
the examples of Euler's and Abel's formal rings.

considers the full $n$-dimensional case. Although the mathematical model is the

belongs to the general class of $f(R,\phi ,X)$ theories of gravity, where

$X=\frac{1}{2}\partial^{\mu}\phi\partial_{\mu}\phi$. We focus on the
inflationary phenomenology of the model, in the slow-roll approximation, and we
investigate whether viable inflationary evolutions can be realized in the
context of this theory. We use two approaches, firstly by imposing the
slow-roll conditions and by using a non-viable vacuum $f(R)$ gravity. As we
demonstrate, the spectral index of the primordial scalar perturbations and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio of the resulting theory can be compatible with the
latest observational data. In the second approach, we fix the functional form
of the Hubble rate as a function of the $e$-foldings number, and we modify
well-known vacuum $f(R)$ gravity reconstruction techniques, in order to find
the $k$-essence $f(R)$ gravity which can realize the given Hubble rate.
Accordingly, we calculate the slow-roll indices and the corresponding
observational indices, and we also provide general formulas of these quantities
in the slow-roll approximation. As we demonstrate, viability can be obtained in
this case too, however the result is strongly model dependent. In addition, we
discuss when ghosts can occur in the theory, and we investigate under which
conditions ghosts can be avoided by using a particular class of models.
Finally, we qualitatively discuss the existence of inflationary attractors for

photometric measurements from 2018 January$-$2019 February, as well as publicly

completely finished yet. If the present dimming originates from the same
orbiting dust clump that caused a similar brightness variation in 2012, than
our results suggest a viscous spreading of the dust particles along the orbit.
Another scenario is that the current minimum is caused by a dust structure,
that is entering and leaving the inner part of the system. The WISE
measurements could be consistent with this scenario. Our long-term data, as

such kind of functional data. Our estimator of the 2D coefficient function is
the optimizer of a form of penalized least squares where the penalty enforces a
certain level of smoothness on the estimator. Our first result is the
Representer Theorem which states that the exact optimizer of the penalized
least squares actually resides in a data-adaptive finite dimensional subspace
although the optimization problem is defined on a function space of infinite
dimensions. This theorem then allows us an easy incorporation of the Gaussian
quadrature into the optimization of the penalized least squares, which can be
carried out through standard numerical procedures. We also show that our
estimator achieves the minimax convergence rate in mean prediction under the
framework of function-on-function regression. Extensive simulation studies
demonstrate the numerical advantages of our method over the existing ones,
where a sparse functional data extension is also introduced. The proposed
method is then applied to our motivating examples of the benchmark Canadian
weather data and a histone regulation study.

quality of labels. In a typical label collection process, multiple annotators
provide subjective noisy estimates of the ""truth"" under the influence of their
varying skill-levels and biases. Blindly treating these noisy labels as the
ground truth limits the accuracy of learning algorithms in the presence of
strong disagreement. This problem is critical for applications in domains such
as medical imaging where both the annotation cost and inter-observer
variability are high. In this work, we present a method for simultaneously
learning the individual annotator model and the underlying true label
distribution, using only noisy observations. Each annotator is modeled by a
confusion matrix that is jointly estimated along with the classifier
predictions. We propose to add a regularization term to the loss function that
encourages convergence to the true annotator confusion matrix. We provide a
theoretical argument as to how the regularization is essential to our approach

simplicity of the idea, experiments on image classification tasks with both

on par with the state-of-the-art methods and is capable of estimating the

or inorganic, is a critical primary step in material development and analysis.
The most common practices involve analysis of diffraction patterns produced in
laboratory XRD, TEM, and synchrotron X-ray sources. However, these techniques
are slow, require careful sample preparation, can be difficult to access, and
are prone to human error during analysis. This paper presents a newly developed
methodology that represents a paradigm change in electron diffraction-based
structure analysis techniques, with the potential to revolutionize multiple
crystallography-related fields. A machine learning-based approach for rapid and
autonomous identification of the crystal structure of metals and alloys,
ceramics, and geological specimens, without any prior knowledge of the sample,
is presented and demonstrated utilizing the electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) technique. Electron backscatter diffraction patterns are collected from
materials with well-known crystal structures, then a deep neural network model
is constructed for classification to a specific Bravais lattice or point group.
The applicability of this approach is evaluated on diffraction patterns from
samples unknown to the computer without any human input or data filtering. This
is in comparison to traditional Hough transform EBSD, which requires that you
have already determined the phases present in your sample. The internal
operations of the neural network are elucidated through visualizing the
symmetry features learned by the convolutional neural network. It is determined
that the model looks for the same features a crystallographer would use, even
though it is not explicitly programmed to do so. This study opens the door to
fully automated, high-throughput determination of crystal structures via
several electron-based diffraction techniques.

ad-hoc network (VANET) has become an irreplaceable part of the Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITSs). However, the traditional network of the ground
cannot meet the requirements of transmission, processing, and storage among
vehicles. Under this circumstance, integrating space and air nodes into the
whole network can provide comprehensive traffic information and reduce the
transmission delay. The high mobility and low latency in the Space-Air-Ground
Integrated Network (SAGIN) put forward higher requirements for security issues
such as identity authentication, privacy protection, and data security. This
paper simplifies the Blockchain and proposes an identity authentication and
privacy protection scheme based on the Hashchain in the SAGIN. The scheme
focuses on the characteristics of the wireless signal to identify and
authenticate the nodes. The verification and backup of the records on the block
are implemented with the distributed streaming platform, Kafka algorithm,
instead of the consensus. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the security of this
scheme. Afterward, the experimental results reveal the delay brought by the
scheme using the simulation of SUMO, OMNeT++, and Veins.

$N$-body problems in cosmological, stellar cluster, and planetary system

orbital stability. Newtonian gravity is scale free, and there is no preferred
time or length scale: this is at odds with construction of traditional
symplectic integrators, in which there is an explicit timescale in the
time-step. Additional timescales have been incorporated into symplectic
integration using various techniques, such as hybrid methods and potential
decompositions in planetary astrophysics, integrator sub-cycling in cosmology,
and block time-stepping in stellar astrophysics, at the cost of breaking or
potentially breaking symplecticity at a few points in phase space. The
justification provided, if any, for this procedure is that these trouble points
where the symplectic structure is broken should be rarely or never encountered
in practice. We consider the case of hybrid integrators, which are used
ubiquitously in astrophysics and other fields, to show that symplecticity
breaks at a few points are sufficient to destroy beneficial properties of
symplectic integrators, which is at odds with some statements in the
literature. We show how to solve this problem in the case of hybrid integrators
by requiring Lipschitz continuity of the equations of motion. For other
techniques, like time step subdivision, {consequences to this this problem are
not explored here}, and the fact that symplectic structure is broken should be
taken into account by $N$-body simulators, who may find an alternative
non-symplectic integrator performs similarly.

the first one needs an additional assumption, nonuniform Lyapunov matrix, to
guarantee that the linear SDE can be transformed into a decoupled one, while

in determining the stability of the perturbed equation, and hence we deduce the

homology (ECH), defined with respect to an open book decomposition compatible
with a contact structure on some 3-manifold, M. The knot in question is given
by the (null-homologous) binding of the open book and the chain complex is
defined in terms of closed orbits of the Reeb vector field and certain
pseudoholomorphic curves in the symplectization of the knot complement. In this
thesis we first generalize this construction to the case of rational open book
decompositions, allowing us to define ECK for rationally null-homologous knots.
In its most general form this is a bi-filtered chain complex whose homology
yields ECH of the closed manifold. There is also a hat version of ECK in this
situation which is equipped with an Alexander grading equivalent to that in the
Heegaard Floer setting, categorifies the Alexander polynomial, and is
conjecturally isomorphic to the hat version of knot Floer homology, HFK. The
main result of this thesis is a large negative n-surgery formula for ECK.
Namely, we start with an (integral) open book decomposition of a manifold with
binding K and compute, for large n, ECK of the knot K(-n) obtained by
performing (-n)-surgery on K. This formula agrees with Hedden's large n-surgery
formula for HFK, providing supporting evidence towards the conjectured
equivalence between the two theories. Along the way, we also prove that ECK is,
in many cases, independent of the choices made to define it, namely the almost
complex structure on the symplectization and the homotopy type of the contact
form. We also prove that, in the case of integral open book decompositions, the
hat version of ECK is supported in Alexander gradings less than or equal to
twice the genus of the knot.

then generates modified and local virtual constraints for each agent that allow

$n$-dimensional infinite grid, $n\geq 3$, by initially collocated finite state
agents (scouts/robots). Recently, the problem has been well characterized for 2
dimensions for deterministic as well as randomized agents, both in synchronous
and semi-synchronous models. It has been conjectured that $n+1$ randomized
agents are necessary to solve this problem in the $n$-dimensional grid. In this
paper we disprove the conjecture in a strong sense: we show that three
randomized synchronous agents suffice to explore an $n$-dimensional grid for
any $n$. Our algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of the agents. Our key
insight is that a constant number of finite state machine agents can, by their
positions and movements, implement a stack, which can store the path being
explored. We also show how to implement our algorithm using: four randomized
semi-synchronous agents; four deterministic synchronous agents; or five
deterministic semi-synchronous agents.
  We give a different algorithm that uses $4$ deterministic semi-synchronous
agents for the $3$-dimensional grid. This is provably optimal, and
surprisingly, matches the result for $2$ dimensions. For $n\geq 4$, the time
complexity of the solutions mentioned above is exponential in distance $D$ of
the treasure from the starting point of the agents. We show that in the
deterministic case, one additional agent brings the time down to a polynomial.
Finally, we focus on algorithms that never venture much beyond the distance
$D$. We describe an algorithm that uses $O(\sqrt{n})$ semi-synchronous
deterministic agents that never go beyond $2D$, as well as show that any
algorithm using $3$ synchronous deterministic agents in $3$ dimensions must
travel beyond $\Omega(D^{3/2})$ from the origin.

control of real-world robots. However, the generalization of such models
depends critically on the quantity and variety of data available for training.
This data can be difficult to obtain for some types of robotic systems, such as
fragile, small-scale quadrotors. Simulated rendering and physics can provide
for much larger datasets, but such data is inherently of lower quality: many of
the phenomena that make the real-world autonomous flight problem challenging,
such as complex physics and air currents, are modeled poorly or not at all, and
the systematic differences between simulation and the real world are typically
impossible to eliminate. In this work, we investigate how data from both
simulation and the real world can be combined in a hybrid deep reinforcement
learning algorithm. Our method uses real-world data to learn about the dynamics
of the system, and simulated data to learn a generalizable perception system
that can enable the robot to avoid collisions using only a monocular camera. We
demonstrate our approach on a real-world nano aerial vehicle collision
avoidance task, showing that with only an hour of real-world data, the
quadrotor can avoid collisions in new environments with various lighting
conditions and geometry. Code, instructions for building the aerial vehicles,

problem is to find a minimum sized subset of $S$ such that every vertex in $U$
is adjacent to some vertex of this subset. It is NP-hard to approximate set
cover to within a $(1-o(1))\ln n$ factor. If we use the size of the optimum
solution $k$ as the parameter, then it can be solved in $n^{k+o(1)}$ time. A
natural question is: can we approximate set cover to within an $o(\ln n)$
factor in $n^{k-\epsilon}$ time?
  In a recent breakthrough result, Karthik, Laekhanukit and Manurangsi showed
that assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), for any computable
function $f$, no $f(k)\cdot n^{k-\epsilon}$-time algorithm can approximate set
cover to a factor below $(\log n)^{\frac{1}{poly(k,e(\epsilon))}}$ for some
function $e$.
  This paper presents a simple gap-producing reduction which, given a set cover
instance $I=(S,U,E)$ and two integers $k<h\le (1-o(1))\sqrt[k]{\log
|S|/\log\log |S|}$, outputs a new set cover instance $I'=(S,U',E')$ with
$|U'|=|U|^{h^k}|S|^{O(1)}$ in $|U|^{h^k}\cdot |S|^{O(1)}$ time such that:
  (1) if $I$ has a $k$-sized solution, then so does $I'$;
  (2) if $I$ has no $k$-sized solution, then every solution of $I'$ must
contain at least $h$ vertices.
  Setting $h=(1-o(1))\sqrt[k]{\log |S|/\log\log |S|}$, we show that assuming
SETH, for any computable function $f$, no $f(k)\cdot n^{k-\epsilon}$-time
algorithm can distinguish between a set cover instance with $k$-sized solution
and one whose minimum solution size is at least $(1-o(1))\cdot
\sqrt[k]{\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}}$. This improves the result of Karthik,
Laekhanukit and Manurangsi.

achieve the omniscience with the minimum sum rate is shown to coincide with the
core (the solution set) of a coalitional game. Two game-theoretic fairness
solutions are studied: the Shapley value and the egalitarian solution. It is
shown that the Shapley value assigns each user the source coding rate measured
by his/her remaining information of the multiple source given the common
randomness that is shared by all users, while the egalitarian solution simply
distributes the rates as evenly as possible in the core. To avoid the
exponentially growing complexity of obtaining the Shapley value, a
polynomial-time approximation method is proposed by utilizing the fact that the
Shapley value is the mean value over all extreme points in the core. In
addition, a steepest descent algorithm is proposed which converges in
polynomial time to the fractional egalitarian solution in the core that can be
implemented by network coding schemes. Finally, it is shown that the game can

centralized voting systems in decentralized IoT since the traditional ones are
not suitable for such scenarios. Unfortunately, self-tallying voting systems
inherently suffer from fairness issues, such as adaptive and abortive issues

the updates and it makes a commitment by using a smart contract to provide
financial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to the
IoT devices. A transmission node gets financial incentive by providing a
proof-of-delivery. The transmission node uses double authentication preventing
signature (DAPS) to carry out the fair exchange to obtain the
proof-of-delivery. Specifically, the transmission node exchanges an
attribute-based signature from a IoT device by using DAPS. Then, it uses the
attribute-based signature as a proof-of-delivery to receive financial
incentives. Generally, the IoT device has to execute complex computation for an

that Lorentzian measures enjoy several negative dependence properties. We also

penalized least squares estimator with penalty term proportional to a Laplacian
quadratic form. This type of estimators has recently received considerable
attention due to its capability in incorporating underlying topological graph
structure of variables into the learning process. While the estimation problem
can be solved efficiently by state-of-the-art optimization techniques, its
statistical consistency properties have been largely overlooked. In this work,
we develop a non-asymptotic bound of estimation error under the classical
statistical setting, where sample size is larger than the ambient dimension of
the latent variables. This bound illustrates theoretically the impact of the
alignment between the data and the graph structure as well as the graph
spectrum on the estimation accuracy. It also provides theoretical evidence of
the advantage, in terms of convergence rate, of the graph Laplacian regularized
estimator over classical ones (that ignore the graph structure) in case of a
smoothness prior. Finally, we provide empirical results of the estimation error
to corroborate the theoretical analysis.

becoming a mainstream technique to search for materials with properties that
are tailored for specific applications. Its efficiency combined with the
increasing availability of open-source codes and large computational resources
makes it a powerful and attractive tool in materials research. Herein, we will
review a selection of recent, high-profile HTPS projects for new materials and

operating at maximum ecological function (EF) which represents a compromise
between the power output and the loss of power due to entropy production. We
derive analytic expressions for efficiency under the assumptions of strong
matter-field coupling and high bath temperatures. Upper and lower bounds on the
efficiency exist in case of extreme asymmetric dissipation when the ratio of
system-bath coupling constants at the hot and the cold contacts respectively
approaches, zero or infinity. These bounds have been established previously for
various classical models of Carnot-like engines. We conclude that while the
engine produces at least 75\% of the power output as compared with the maximum
power conditions, the fractional loss of power is appreciably low in case of
the engine operating at maximum EF, thus making this objective function
relevant from an environmental point of view.

discrimination, processes involving algorithms can provide crucial forms of
transparency that are otherwise unavailable. These benefits do not happen

protons to investigate the propagation of energetic particles accelerated by
flares or travelling shock waves within the stellar wind and magnetic field of
a TRAPPIST-1-like system. Turbulence was simulated with small-scale
magnetostatic perturbations with an isotropic power spectrum. We find that only
a few percent of particles injected within half a stellar radius from the
stellar surface escape, and that the escaping fraction increases strongly with
increasing injection radius. Escaping particles are increasingly deflected and
focused by the ambient spiralling magnetic field as the superimposed turbulence
amplitude is increased. In our TRAPPIST-1-like simulations, regardless of the
angular region of injection, particles are strongly focused onto two caps
within the fast wind regions and centered on the equatorial planetary orbital
plane. Based on a scaling relation between far-UV emission and energetic
protons for solar flares applied to M dwarfs, the innermost putative habitable
planet, TRAPPIST-1e, is bombarded by a proton flux up to 6 orders of magnitude
larger than experienced by the present-day Earth. We note two mechanisms that

to reduce the required number of function evaluations for BO without compromise
in solution quality. We explore the idea of posterior regularization to harness
low fidelity (LF) data within the Gaussian process upper confidence bound

approximation of the BOF or of a related optimization task. An extra GP model
called LF-GP is trained to fit the LF data. We develop an operator termed
dynamic weighted product of experts (DW-POE) fusion. The regularization is
induced by this operator on the posterior of the BOF. The impact of the LF GP

and accurately approximate the optimal transfer between any two rendezvous
targets. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN)-based method is proposed
for quickly approximating optimal perturbed long-duration impulsive transfers.
This kind of transfer is divided into three types according to the variation
trend of the right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) difference between
the departure body and the rendezvous target. An efficient database generation
method combined with a reliable optimization approach is developed. Three
regression DNNs are trained individually and applied to approximate the
corresponding types of transfers. The simulation results show that the
well-trained DNNs are capable of quickly estimating the optimal velocity
increments with a relative error of less than 3% for all the three types of
transfers. The tests on the debris chains with the total velocity increments of
several thousand m/s show that the estimated results can be very close to the
optimized ones with a final estimation error of less than 10 m/s.

behavior to the existence of nanoscale Fe-rich ferromagnetic domains acting as
superparamagnets. By fitting the magnetization curves using the Langevin
function representing superparamagnetism plus the paramagnetic linear function,
we estimated the average magnetic moment of the nanoscale ferromagnetic domain
to be 300-400 $\mu_{B}$, and the fraction of Fe atoms participating in the

(In,Fe)As:Be and Ge:Fe, and seems to be a universal characteristic of the

weakening of the ferromagnetism probably because antiferromagnetic
superexchange interaction between nearest-neighbor Fe-Fe pairs becomes
dominant.

Coulomb parameters becomes more gradual than the unrelaxed case. Furthermore,
the structure relaxation dramatically changes the $\Delta E$ value and the
occupation number at the interface. This study not only evidences the

by suitably introducing break-make junctions on a flexible platform, a network
can be made to serve as a resistive strain sensor. Several experimental designs
have been proposed using networks made of silver nanowires, carbon nanotubes
and metal meshes with high sensitivities. However, there is limited theoretical
understanding; the reported studies have taken the numerical approach and only
consider rearrangement of nanowires with strain, while the critical break-make
property of the sensor observed experimentally has largely been ignored.
Herein, we propose a generic geometrical based model and study distortion,
including the break-make aspect, and change in electrical percolation of the
network on applying strain. The result shows that when a given strain is
applied, wire segments below a critical angle with respect to the applied
strain direction end up breaking, leading to increased resistance of the
network. The percolation shows interesting attributes; the calculated
resistance increases linearly in the beginning and at a higher rate for higher
strains, consistent with the experimental findings. In a real scenario, the
strain direction need not necessarily be in the direction of measurement, and
therefore, strain value and its direction both are incorporated into the
treatment. The study reveals interesting anisotropic conduction features;
strain sensitivity is higher parallel to the strain, while strain range is
wider for perpendicular measurement. The percolation is also investigated on
direct microscopic images of metal networks to obtain resistance-strain
characteristics and identification of current percolation pathways. The
findings will be important for electrical percolation in general, particularly
in predicting characteristics and improvising metal network-based strain

In many
modern SLAM pipelines, bundle adjustment is performed to estimate the 6DOF
camera trajectory and 3D map (3D point cloud) from the input feature tracks.
However, two fundamental weaknesses plague SLAM systems based on bundle
adjustment. First, the need to carefully initialise bundle adjustment means
that all variables, in particular the map, must be estimated as accurately as
possible and maintained over time, which makes the overall algorithm
cumbersome. Second, since estimating the 3D structure (which requires
sufficient baseline) is inherent in bundle adjustment, the SLAM algorithm will
encounter difficulties during periods of slow motion or pure rotational motion.
  We propose a different SLAM optimisation core: instead of bundle adjustment,
we conduct rotation averaging to incrementally optimise only camera
orientations. Given the orientations, we estimate the camera positions and 3D
points via a quasi-convex formulation that can be solved efficiently and
globally optimally. Our approach not only obviates the need to estimate and
maintain the positions and 3D map at keyframe rate (which enables simpler SLAM
systems), it is also more capable of handling slow motions or pure rotational
motions.

the analytic representation for permittivity of typical peptide along the

fluctuation-induced free energy are performed at room temperature for the
freestanding peptide films, containing different fractions of water, and for
similar films deposited on dielectric (SiO$_2$) and metal (Au) substrates. It
is shown that the free energy of a freestanding peptide film is negative and,
thus, contributes to its stability. The magnitude of the free energy increases
with increasing fraction of water and decreases with increasing thickness of a
film. For peptide films deposited on a dielectric substrate the free energy is
nonmonotonous. It is negative for thicker than 100 nm films, reaches the
maximum value at some film thickness, but vanishes and changes its sign for
thinner than 100 nm films. The fluctuation-induced free energy of peptide films
deposited on metallic substrate is found to be positive which makes films less
stable. In all three cases, simple analytic expressions for the free energy of
sufficiently thick films are found. The obtained results may be useful to
attain film stability in the next generation of organic microdevices with

Vazdekis/MILES model for spectral fitting, the IMF variation will lead to not
only a systematic offset in $M_*/L_r$, but also offsets in age and metallicity,
and these offsets increase with increasing stellar population ages. However,
the IMF-variation caused metallicity offsets disappear in the case of
Galaxev/STELIB based libraries. 3) The Padova2000 model provides a better match
to the MaNGA galaxy spectra at [M/H]$_L<-1.0$, while the BaSTI model match the
local galaxy spectra better at [M/H]$_L>-1.0$. Current tests suggest that
spectral fitting with the Vazdekis/MILES+BaSTI combination would be a better
choice for local galaxies.

vortex velocities $v\simeq1$ km/s above which samples abruptly transit into the
normal state. In the Larkin-Ovchinnikov framework, near the critical
temperature this is because of a flux-flow instability triggered by the
reduction of the viscous drag coefficient due to the quasiparticles leaving the
vortex cores. While the existing instability theories rely upon a uniform
spatial distribution of vortex velocities, the measured (mean) value of $v$ is
always smaller than the maximal possible one, since the distribution of $v$
never reaches the $\delta$-functional shape. Here, by guiding magnetic flux
quanta at a tilt angle of $15^\circ$ with respect to a Co nanostripe array, we
speed up vortices to supersonic velocities. These exceed $v$ in the reference
as-grown Nb films by almost an order of magnitude and are only a factor of two
smaller than the maximal vortex velocities observed in superconductors so far.
We argue that such high $v$ values appear in consequence of a collective
dynamic ordering when all vortices move in the channels with the same pinning
strength and exhibit a very narrow distribution of $v$. Our findings render the
well-known vortex guiding effect to open prospects for investigations of
ultrafast vortex dynamics.

paper, we model each image as a bag of regions, and follow a multiple instance

Specifically, we take into account the region's degree of pornography, and make
three main contributions. First, we show that based on very few annotations of

impacts of the linear non-minimal coupling on various dynamics from inflation

process with quartic potential dominance, and suppressed physical parameters in
the low energy, etc. In particular, the linear non-minimal coupling leads to
the linear couplings of the sigma field to the Standard Model through the trace
of the energy-momentum tensor in Einstein frame. Thus, regarding the sigma

step towards the exploration of explicit domain supervision. In contrast to
representing domain characteristics using different generators or domain codes,
we pre-train a classification network to explicitly classify the domain of an
image. After pre-training, this network is used to extract the domain-specific
features of each image. Such features, together with the domain-independent
features extracted by another encoder (shared across different domains), are
used to generate image in target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple
facial attribute translation, multiple identity translation, multiple season
translation and conditional edges-to-shoes/handbags demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. In addition, we can transfer the domain-specific
feature extractor obtained on the Facescrub dataset with domain supervision
information to unseen domains, such as faces in the CelebA dataset. We also
succeed in achieving conditional translation with any two images in CelebA,

\textbf{precise} measurements of relative 3D motion parameters and to validate
its accuracy using image data is a challenging task. In this work, we propose
an alternative approach that circumvents the 3D motion estimation requirement
to obtain a dense depth map of a dynamic scene. Given per-pixel optical flow
correspondences between two consecutive frames and, the sparse depth prior for
the reference frame, we show that, we can effectively recover the dense depth
map for the successive frames without solving for 3D motion parameters. Our
method assumes a piece-wise planar model of a dynamic scene, which undergoes
rigid transformation locally, and as-rigid-as-possible transformation globally
between two successive frames. Under our assumption, we can avoid the explicit
estimation of 3D rotation and translation to estimate scene depth. In essence,
our formulation provides an unconventional way to think and recover the dense
depth map of a complex dynamic scene which is incremental and motion free in
nature. Our proposed method does not make object level or any other high-level
prior assumption about the dynamic scene, as a result, it is applicable to a
wide range of scenarios. Experimental results on the benchmarks dataset show
the competence of our approach for multiple frames.

stellar populations, allowing us to explore the similarities and differences
between galaxy bulges and discs, and how they affect the global properties of
the galaxy. We find that the components have interesting variations in their
stellar populations, and display different kinematics. Bulges tend to be
consistently more metal rich than their disc counterparts, and while the ages
of both components are comparable, there is an interesting tail of younger,
more metal poor discs. Bulges and discs follow their own distinct kinematic
relationships, both on the plane of the stellar spin parameter, lambda_R, and
ellipticity, and in the relation between stellar mass and specific angular
momentum, j, with the location of the galaxy as a whole on these planes being
determined by how much bulge and disc it contains. As a check of the physical
significance of the kinematic decompositions, we also dynamically model the
individual galaxy components within the global potential of the galaxy. The
resulting components exhibit kinematic parameters consistent with those from
the spectroscopic decomposition, and though the dynamical modelling suffers
from some degeneracies, the bulges and discs display systematically different
intrinsic dynamical properties. This work demonstrates the value in considering
the individual components of galaxies rather than treating them as a single
entity, which neglects information that may be crucial in understanding where,
when and how galaxies evolve into the systems we see today.

fundamental open problem in both science and the industry. Traditional
techniques for finding rate constants require either chemical modifications of
the reactants or indirect measurements. The rate constant map method is a
modern technique to study binding equilibrium and kinetics in chemical
reactions. Finding a rate constant map from biosensor data is an ill-posed
inverse problem that is usually solved by regularization. In this work, rather
than finding a deterministic regularized rate constant map that does not
provide uncertainty quantification of the solution, we develop an adaptive
variational Bayesian approach to estimate the distribution of the rate constant
map, from which some intrinsic properties of a chemical reaction can be
explored, including information about rate constants. Our new approach is more
realistic than the existing approaches used for biosensors and allows us to
estimate the dynamics of the interactions, which are usually hidden in a
deterministic approximate solution. We verify the performance of the new
proposed method by numerical simulations, and compare it with the Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithm. The results illustrate that the variational method can
reliably capture the posterior distribution in a computationally efficient way.
Finally, the developed method is also tested on the real biosensor data

thresholding contour map and the high order moment map -- to estimate the

Redshift Survey (2MRS), a near-complete census of the nearby universe. Our
catalog consists of 1929 broad line AGNs, and 6562 narrow line AGNs which
satisfy the \citet{Kauffmann03} criteria, of which 3607 also satisfy the
\citet{Kewley01} criteria. We also report emission line widths, fluxes, flux
errors, and signal-to-noise ratios of all the galaxies in our spectroscopic
sample, allowing users to customize the selection criteria. Although we
uniformly processed the spectra of galaxies from a homogeneous parent sample,
inhomogeneities persist due to the differences in the quality of the obtained
spectra, taken with different instruments, and the unavailability of spectra
for $\sim$20\% of the galaxies. We quantify how the differences in spectral
quality affect not only the AGN detection rates but also broad line to narrow
line AGN ratios. We find that the inhomogeneities primarily stem from the
continuum signal-to-noise (S/N) in the spectra near the emission lines of
interest. We fit for the AGN fraction as a function of continuum S/N and assign
AGN likelihoods to galaxies which were not identified as AGNs using the
available spectra. This correction results in a catalog suitable for
statistical studies. This work also paves the way for a truly homogeneous and
complete nearby AGN catalog by identifying galaxies whose AGN status needs to
be verified with higher quality spectra, quantifying the spectral quality
necessary to do so.

connected via inhibitory delayed pulses. For globally coupled systems the
increase of the inhibitory coupling reduces the number of firing neurons by
following a Winner Takes All mechanism. For sufficiently large transmission
delay we observe the emergence of collective oscillations in the system beyond
a critical coupling value. Heterogeneity promotes neural inactivation and
asynchronous dynamics and its effect can be counteracted by considering longer
time delays. In sparse networks, inhibition has the counterintuitive effect of
promoting neural reactivation of silent neurons for sufficiently large
coupling. In this regime, current fluctuations are on one side responsible for
neural firing of sub-threshold neurons and on the other side for their
desynchronization. Therefore, collective oscillations are present only in a
limited range of coupling values, which remains finite in the thermodynamic
limit. Out of this range the dynamics is asynchronous and for very large
inhibition neurons display a bursting behaviour alternating periods of silence
with periods where they fire freely in absence of any inhibition.

horizontal branch (HB) morphology. While many papers have been dedicated to the
helium abundance in the different stellar populations, small efforts have been
done to disentangle the effects of mass loss and helium content. We exploit the
nearby GC NGC6121 (M4), which hosts two well-studied main stellar populations,
to infer both helium and RGB mass loss. We combine multi-band Hubble Space
Telescope photometry of RGB and main sequence (MS) stars of M4 with synthetic
spectra to constrain the relative helium content of its stellar populations. We
find that the second generation stars in M4 is enhanced in helium mass fraction
by $\rm \Delta Y = 0.013 \pm 0.002$ with respect to the remaining stars that
have pristine helium content. We then infer the mass of the HB stars by
searching for the best match between the observations and HB populations
modelled assuming the helium abundance of each population estimated from the
MS. By comparing the masses of stars along the HB, we constrain the mass loss
of first- and second-generation stars in M4. We find that the mass lost by the
helium enriched population is $\sim 13$% larger than the mass lost by the first
generation stars ($\rm \Delta \mu = 0.027 \pm 0.006 \ M_\odot$). We discuss the
possibility that this mass loss difference depends on helium abundance, the

random fields (GRF) $X:M\to \mathbb{R}^k$, that we interpret as random
variables with values in $\mathcal{C}^r(M, \mathbb{R}^k)$, inducing on it a
Gaussian measure.
  When the latter is given the weak Whitney topology, the convergence in law of
$X$ allows to compute the limit probability of certain events in terms of the
probability distribution of the limit. This is true, in particular, for the
events of a geometric or topological nature, like: ""$X$ is transverse to $W$""
or ""$X^{-1}(0)$ is homeomorphic to $Z$"".
  We relate the convergence in law of a sequence of GRFs with that of their
covariance structures, proving that in the smooth case ($r=\infty$), the two
conditions coincide, in analogy with what happens for finite dimensional
Gaussian measures. We also show that this is false in the case of finite
regularity ($r\in\mathbb{N}$), although the convergence of the covariance
structures in the $\mathcal{C}^{r+2}$ sense is a sufficient condition for the
convergence in law of the corresponding GRFs in the $\mathcal{C}^r$ sense.
  We complement this study by proving an important technical tools: an infinite

ensures that, under some conditions on the support, the jet of a GRF is almost
surely transverse to a given submanifold of the jet space.

harmonic analysis ($2^{nd}$ part)"", we address three rich historical themes in
harmonic analysis that rely fundamentally on the concept of non-zero curvature.
Namely, we focus on the boundedness properties of (I) the linear Hilbert
transform and maximal operator along variable curves, (II) Carleson-type
operators in the presence of curvature, and (III) the bilinear Hilbert
transform and maximal operator along variable curves.
  Our Main Theorem states that, given a general variable curve $\gamma(x,t)$ in
the plane that is assumed only to be measurable in $x$ and to satisfy suitable
non-zero curvature (in $t$) and non-degeneracy conditions, all of the above
itemized operators defined along the curve $\gamma$ are $L^p$-bounded for
$1<p<\infty$.
  Our result provides a new and unified treatment of these three themes.
Moreover, it establishes a unitary approach for both the singular integral and
the maximal operator versions within themes (I) and (III).
  At the heart of our approach stays a methodology encompassing three key
ingredients: 1) discretization on the multiplier side that confines the phase
of the multiplier to oscillate at the \emph{linear} level, 2)
\emph{Gabor}-frame discretization of the input function(s) and 3) extraction of
the \emph{cancelation} hidden in the non-zero curvature of $\gamma$ via
$TT^{*}-$orthogonality methods and time-frequency \emph{correlation}.

$Q^2$, is of particular interest because perturbative QCD predictions take a
simple form in that limit that depends on the meson decay constant. We
previously showed in\cite{jonnaff} that, up to $Q^2$ of 6 $\mathrm{GeV}^2$, the

towards that value at higher $Q^2$. Here we give predictions for real mesons,

probability distributions still has no satisfactory solution. Due to lack of
information outside the range of the data the tails of the distribution should
be described via many characteristics. Index of regular variation is a good
characteristic, but it puts too many distributions with very different tail
behavior in one and the same class. One can consider for example
Pareto($\alpha$), Fr$\acute{e}$chet($\alpha$) and Hill-horror($\alpha$) with
one and the same fixed parameter $\alpha > 0$. The main disadvantage of VaR,
expectiles, and hazard functions, when we speak about the tails of the
distribution, is that they depend on the center of the distribution and on the
scaling factor. Therefore, they are very appropriate for predicting ""big
losses"", but after a right characterization of the distributional type of ""the
payoff"". When analyzing the tail of the observed distribution we need some
characteristic which does not depend on the moments because in the most
important cases of the heavy-tailed distributions theoretical moments do not
exist and the corresponding empirical moments fluctuate too much. In this
paper, we show that probabilities for different types of outside values can be
very appropriate characteristics of the tails of the observed distribution.
They do not depend on increasing affine transformations and do not need the
existence of the moments. The idea origins from Tukey's box plots, and allows
us to obtain one and the same characteristic of the tail of the observed
distribution within the whole distributional type with respect to increasing
affine transformations. These characteristics answer the question: At what
extent we can observe ""unexpected"" values?

transfer along these magnetic fields, with the potential to heat plasma and
accelerate stellar winds [3] [4] [5]. Despite Alfv\'enic waves having been
identified in the Sun's atmosphere, the nature of the basal wave energy flux is
poorly understood. It is generally assumed that the associated Poynting flux is
generated solely in the photosphere and propagates into the corona, typically
through the continuous buffeting of magnetic fields by turbulent convective
cells [4] [6] [7]. Here we provide evidence that the Sun's internal acoustic
modes also contribute to the basal flux of Alfv\'enic waves, delivering a
spatially ubiquitous input to the coronal energy balance that is sustained over
the solar cycle. Alfv\'enic waves are thus a fundamental feature of the Sun's
corona. Acknowledging that internal acoustic modes have a key role in injecting
additional Poynting flux into the upper atmospheres of Sun-like stars has
potentially significant consequences for the modelling of stellar coronae and
winds.

variations of the Dispersion Measure (DM), which are related to spatial
variations in the interstellar electron content. Correcting for DM variations
relies on the cold-plasma dispersion law which states that the dispersive delay
varies with the squared inverse of the observing frequency. This may however
give incorrect measurements if the probed electron content (and therefore the
DM) varies with observing frequency, as is predicted theoretically.
  Aims. We study small-scale density variations in the ionised interstellar
medium. These structures may lead to frequency-dependent DMs in pulsar signals
and could inhibit the use of lower-frequency pulsar observations to correct
time-variable interstellar dispersion in higher-frequency pulsar-timing data.
  Methods. We used high-cadence, low-frequency observations with three stations
from the German LOng-Wavelength (GLOW) consortium, which are part of the LOw
Frequency ARray (LOFAR). Specifically, 3.5 years of weekly observations of PSR
J2219+4754 are presented.
  Results. We present the first detection of frequency-dependent DMs towards
any interstellar object and a precise multi-year time-series of the time- and
frequency-dependence of the measured DMs. The observed DM variability is
significant and may be caused by extreme scattering events. Potential causes
for frequency-dependent DMs are quantified and evaluated.
  Conclusions. We conclude that frequency-dependence of DMs has been reliably
detected and is caused by small-scale (up to 10s of AUs) but steep density
variations in the interstellar electron content. We find that long-term trends
in DM variability equally affect DMs measured at both ends of our frequency
band and hence the negative impact on long-term high-precision timing projects
is expected to be limited.

Numerical simulations reveal transitions to negative SCCs at intermediate

negative at an intermediate value of the network oscillation strength. The
dependence of the SCC on two canonical schemes for synaptic connectivity is
studied, and it is shown that the results occur robustly in both schemes. For

to be an artifact of a decoupling between pressure and reaction fronts.

  Traits","10 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the era of social media and big data, the use of visual evidence to
document conflict and human rights abuse has become an important element for
human rights organizations and advocates. In this paper, we address the task of
detecting two types of human rights abuses in challenging, everyday photos: (1)
child labour, and (2) displaced populations. We propose a novel model that is
driven by a human-centric approach. Our hypothesis is that the emotional state
of a person -- how positive or pleasant an emotion is, and the control level of
the situation by the person -- are powerful cues for perceiving potential human
rights violations. To exploit these cues, our model learns to predict global
emotional traits over a given image based on the joint analysis of every
detected person and the whole scene. By integrating these predictions with a
data-driven convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, our system
efficiently infers potential human rights abuses in a clean, end-to-end system
we call GET-AID (from Global Emotional Traits for Abuse IDentification).
Extensive experiments are performed to verify our method on the recently
introduced subset of Human Rights Archive (HRA) dataset (2 violation categories
with the same number of positive and negative samples), where we show
quantitatively compelling results. Compared with previous works and the sole
use of a CNN classifier, this paper improves the coverage up to 23.73% for
child labour and 57.21% for displaced populations. Our dataset, codes and
trained models are available online at https://github.com/GKalliatakis/GET-AID.

coupling mechanism to attain the record critical temperatures known to date. We
demonstrate here that the intrinsic advantages of hydrogen for phonon-mediated
superconductivity can be exploited in a completely different system, namely
two-dimensional (2D) materials. We find that hydrogen adatoms can strongly
enhance superconductivity in 2D materials due to flatband states originating
from atomic-like hydrogen orbitals, with a resulting high density of states,
and due to the emergence of high-frequency hydrogen-related phonon modes that
boost the electron-phonon coupling. As a concrete example, we investigate the
effect of hydrogen adatoms on the superconducting properties of monolayer
MgB$_2$, by solving the fully anisotropic Eliashberg equations, in conjunction
with a first-principles description of the electronic and vibrational states,
and the coupling between them. We show that hydrogenation leads to a high
critical temperature of 67 K, which can be boosted to over 100 K by biaxial
tensile strain.

remain large and can limit the accuracy of chemical abundance determinations.
The Belgian repository of fundamental atomic data and stellar spectra (BRASS)
aims to provide a large systematic and homogeneous quality assessment of the
atomic data available for quantitative spectroscopy. BRASS shall compare
synthetic spectra against extremely high quality observed spectra, at a
resolution of ~85000 and signal-noise ratios of ~1000, for around 20 bright
BAFGK spectral type stars, in order to evaluate the atomic data available for
over a thousand potentially useful spectral lines. A large-scale homogeneous
selection of atomic lines is performed by synthesising theoretical spectra of
literature atomic lines, for FGK-type stars including the Sun, resulting in a
selection of 1091 theoretically deep and unblended lines, in the wavelength
range 4200-6800~\AA, which may be suitable for quality assessment.
Astrophysical log(gf) values are determined for the 1091 transitions using two
commonly employed methods. The agreement of these log(gf) values are used to
select well-behaving lines for quality assessment. 845 atomic lines were found
to be suitable for quality assessment, of which 408 were found to be robust
against systematic differences between analysis methods. Around 54% of the
quality-assessed lines were found to have at least one literature log(gf) value
in agreement with our derived values, though the remaining values can disagree
by as much as 0.5 dex. Only 38% of FeI lines were found to have sufficiently
accurate log(gf) values, increasing to ~70-75% for the remaining Fe-group
lines.

clusters and groups of galaxies obtained from Reflection Grating Spectrometer
(RGS) XMM-$Newton$ observations. The high-resolution spectra show FeXVII
emission in many clusters, which implies the existence of cooling flows. The
cooling rates are measured between the bulk Intracluster Medium (ICM)
temperature and 0.01 keV and are typically weak, operating at less than a few
tens of $\rm M_{\odot}\rm yr^{-1}$ in clusters, and less than 1 $\rm
M_{\odot}\rm yr^{-1}$ in groups of galaxies. They are 10-30% of the classical
cooling rates in the absence of heating, which suggests that AGN feedback has a
high level of efficiency. If cooling flows terminate at 0.7 keV in clusters,
the associated cooling rates are higher, and have a typical value of a few to a
few tens of $\rm M_{\odot}\rm yr^{-1}$. Since the soft X-ray emitting region,
where the temperature $kT<1$ keV, is spatially associated with H$\alpha$
nebulosity, we examine the relation between the cooling rates above 0.7 keV and
the H$\alpha$ nebulae. We find that the cooling rates have enough energy to
power the total UV-optical luminosities, and are 5 to 50 times higher than the
observed star formation rates for low luminosity objects. In 4 high luminosity
clusters, the cooling rates above 0.7 keV are not sufficient and an inflow at a
higher temperature is required. Further residual cooling below 0.7 keV
indicates very low complete cooling rates in most clusters.

wisdom of crowd phenomenon. In the so-called naive learning setting, a crowd of
individuals holds opinions that are statistically independent estimates of an
unknown parameter; the crowd is wise when the average opinion converges to the
true parameter in the limit of infinitely many individuals. Unfortunately, even
starting from wise initial opinions, a crowd subject to certain influence
systems may lose its wisdom. It is of great interest to characterize when an
influence system preserves the crowd wisdom effect. In this paper we introduce
and characterize numerous wisdom preservation properties of the basic
French-DeGroot influence system model. Instead of requiring complete
convergence to consensus as in the previous naive learning model by Golub and
Jackson, we study finite-time executions of the French-DeGroot influence
process and establish in this novel context the notion of prominent families
(as a group of individuals with outsize influence). Surprisingly, finite-time
wisdom preservation of the influence system is strictly distinct from its
infinite-time version. We provide a comprehensive treatment of various
finite-time wisdom preservation notions, counterexamples to meaningful

Zagarola & Smits (1997, 1998) at unprecedented laboratory Reynolds numbers have
started an ongoing vigorous debate on the logarithmic law in the mean velocity
profile $U^+(y^+)$ and the intimately related question of Pitot probe
corrections for mean shear, viscous effects and turbulence level. Considering
that the Pitot probe diameter $d^+$ exceeded 7000 wall units at the highest
Reynolds number, the various \textcolor{black}{traditional Pitot} corrections
had to be extended into uncharted territory \textcolor{black}{where they may no
longer be additive}. In this note, the inverse approach is adopted, where the
net result of all the corrections is assumed to be compatible with the model
for $U^+$ developed by \cite{Monk17}. The latter has an inner part which is, up
to higher order corrections, identical to the zero pressure gradient turbulent
boundary layer profile and switches around $y^+_{\mathrm{break}} \approx 400$
to a logarithmic overlap layer with a K\'arm\'an ""parameter"" $\kappa$
\textcolor{black}{that depends on pressure gradient and possibly on other flow
parameters}. The simplicity of the resulting global Pitot correction
proportional to $(d^+)^{0.9}(R^+)^{-0.4}$, with only two fitting parameters,
indirectly supports this model. \textcolor{black}{Based on the required
equality of the overlap and centerline $\kappa$'s, it is furthermore shown that
$y^+_{\mathrm{break}}$ must be a constant.} \textcolor{black}{Finally,} the
outer ""wake"" part of the profile is argued to be asymptotically linear between
the wall and about half the pipe radius. This gives rise to a linear higher
order tail $\propto y^+/R^+$ in the logarithmic overlap layer, which has been
\textcolor{black}{the subject} of asymptotic analysis over the last decades.

semantic priors and an integrated approach for single image IID that involves
analyzing image at three hierarchical context levels. Local context priors
capture scene properties at each pixel within a small neighbourhood. Mid-level
context priors encode object level semantics. Global context priors establish
correspondences at the scene level. Our semantic priors are designed on both
fixed and flexible regions, using selective search method and Convolutional
Neural Network features. Our IID method is an iterative multistage optimization
scheme and consists of two complementary formulations: $L_2$ smoothing for
shading and $L_1$ sparsity for reflectance. Experiments and analysis of our
method indicate the utility of our semantic priors and structured hierarchical
analysis in an IID framework. We compare our method with other contemporary IID
solutions and show results with lesser artifacts. Finally, we highlight that
proper choice and encoding of prior knowledge can produce competitive results

proposed, with strictly associative and unital composition in all dimensions,
and the weak structure arising as a combinatorial notion of homotopy with a
natural geometrical interpretation. Such a theory has the potential to serve as
an attractive foundation for a computer proof assistant for higher category
theory, since it allows composites to be uniquely described, and relieves
proofs from the bureaucracy of associators, unitors and their coherence.
However, this basic theory lacks a high-level way to construct homotopies,
which would be intractable to build directly in complex situations; it is not
therefore immediately amenable to implementation.
  We tackle this problem by describing a contraction operation, which
algorithmically constructs complex homotopies that reduce the lengths of
composite terms. This contraction procedure allows building of nontrivial
proofs by repeatedly contracting subterms, and also allows the contraction of
those proofs themselves, yielding in some cases single-step witnesses for
complex homotopies. We prove correctness of this procedure by showing that it
lifts connected colimits from a base category to a category of zigzags, a
procedure which is then iterated to yield a contraction mechanism in any
dimension. We also present homotopy.io, an online proof assistant that
implements the theory of associative $n$-categories, and use it to construct a
range of examples that illustrate this new contraction mechanism.

clustering which computes arbitrarily shaped clusters as defined as the basins
of attraction to the local modes created by the density gradient ascent paths.
Despite its potential, the Mean Shift approach is a computationally expensive
method for unsupervised learning. Thus, we introduce two contributions aiming
to provide clustering algorithms with a linear time complexity, as opposed to
the quadratic time complexity for the exact Mean Shift clustering. Firstly we
propose a scalable procedure to approximate the density gradient ascent.
Second, our proposed scalable cluster labeling technique is presented. Both
propositions are based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to approximate
nearest neighbors. These two techniques may be used for moderate sized
datasets. Furthermore, we show that using our proposed approximations of the

can also improve dedicated classification metrics. For the latter, a
distributed implementation, written for the Spark/Scala ecosystem is proposed.

data, the cosmological bound on the sum of three active neutrino masses from

$40^{\circ}$-$50^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$-$40^{\circ}$, respectively, and
gradually decreases toward smaller/larger $l$. Five out of the eleven SNRs
emitting both emission lines clearly show an ""[Fe II]-H$_{2}$ reversal,"" where
H$_{2}$ emission features are found outside the SNR boundary in [Fe II]
emission. Our NIR spectroscopy shows that the H$_{2}$ emission originates from
collisionally excited H$_{2}$ gas. The brightest SNR in both [Fe II] and
H$_{2}$ emissions is W49B, contributing more than 70% and 50% of the total [Fe
II] 1.644 $\mu$m ($2.0 \times 10^4$ L$_{\odot}$) and H$_{2}$ 2.122 $\mu$m ($1.2
\times 10^3$ L$_{\odot}$) luminosities of the detected SNRs. The total [Fe II]
1.644 $\mu$m luminosity of our Galaxy is a few times smaller than that expected
from the SN rate using the correlation found in nearby starburst galaxies. We
discuss possible explanations for this.

galaxies, but nearly all of the standard SFR diagnostics are difficult to
measure in active galaxies because of contamination from the active galactic
nucleus (AGN). Being less sensitive to dust extinction, the mid-infrared
fine-structure lines of [NeII] 12.81 micron and [NeIII] 15.56 micron
effectively trace the SFR in star-forming galaxies. These lines also have the
potential to serve as a reliable SFR indicator in active galaxies, provided
that their contribution from the AGN narrow-line region can be removed. We use
a new set of photoionization calculations with realistic AGN spectral energy
distributions and input assumptions to constrain the magnitude of [NeII] and
[NeIII] produced by the narrow-line region for a given strength of [NeV] 14.32
micron. We demonstrate that AGNs emit a relatively restricted range of
[NeII]/[NeV] and [NeIII]/[NeV] ratios. Hence, once [NeV] is measured, the AGN
contribution to the low-ionization Ne lines can be estimated, and the SFR can
be determined from the strength of [NeII] and [NeIII]. We find that AGN host
galaxies have similar properties as compact extragalactic HII regions, which
indicates that the star formation in AGN hosts is spatially concentrated. This
suggests a close relationship between black hole accretion and nuclear star
formation. We update the calibration of [NeII] and [NeIII] strength as a SFR
indicator, explicitly considering the effects of metallicity, finding very good
relations between Ne fractional abundances and the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio for
different metallicities, ionization parameters, and starburst ages. Comparison
of neon-based SFRs with independent SFRs for active and star-forming galaxies
shows excellent consistency with small scatter ($\sim0.18$ dex).

patterns and flow duration. The distribution of the amount of traffic per unit
time is an equally important but less studied problem. We study a large number
of traffic traces from many different networks including academic, commercial

that the log-normal distribution is a better fit than the Gaussian distribution
commonly claimed in the literature. We also investigate a second heavy-tailed
distribution (the Weibull) and show that its performance is better than
Gaussian but worse than log-normal. We examine anomalous traces which are a
poor fit for all distributions tried and show that this is often due to traffic
outages or links that hit maximum capacity.
  We demonstrate the utility of the log-normal distribution in two contexts:
predicting the proportion of time traffic will exceed a given level (for
service level agreement or link capacity estimation) and predicting 95th
percentile pricing. We also show the log-normal distribution is a better
predictor than Gaussian or Weibull distributions.

polarisation for a homogeneous source is sensitive to the properties of the

region around the turn-over frequency, where the synchrotron radiation becomes
optically thick. However, nearly circular characteristic waves result in
circular polarisation dominated by frequencies above the turn-over frequency,
while for nearly linear characteristic waves it is dominated by frequencies
below. Observations argue in favour of nearly circular characteristic waves.
This implies a low energy cut-off in the electron distribution substantially
below that corresponding to the turn-over frequency and, simultaneously,
provides an upper limit to the fraction of electron-positron pairs.

supercritical accretion disk to a $\sim 10 \ M_\odot$ black hole. The latter
launches two oppositely directed jets that precess with a period of $162$ days.
The system has been detected at different spatial scales in frequencies ranging
from radio to gamma rays, and has long been considered as a potential neutrino
source which has been observed by AMANDA in the past, and later IceCube,
leading to more restrictive upper bounds on the neutrino flux. In this work, we
explore the possibilities that neutrinos could be produced in the jets of this
source at levels consistent, or at least, not incompatible with any current
data on electromagnetic emission available. In order to do so, we consider the
injection of both electrons and protons at different positions in the jets, and
we compute their broadband photon emission by synchrotron and interactions with
ambient photons and matter. After correcting the high energy photon flux by the
effect of $\gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma N$ absorption, we obtain the surviving
flux that arrive on Earth and compare it with observational data by gamma-ray
detectors. The flux of high energy neutrinos is consistently computed and we
find that if they are eventually detected with IceCube, production must take
place at the inner jets, where gamma-ray absorption is important, in order to
avoid current VHE constraints form HESS and MAGIC. {Additionally, we find that
if the flux of 25 TeV gamma-rays recently detected with HAWC and which
corresponds to the jet termination region were produced mainly by $pp$
interactions, this would lead to a too faint neutrino flux that is beyond the
reach of IceCube in its present configuration.

on deep learning (DL) techniques for analysis, design, and optimization of
electromagnetic (EM) nanostructures. We use the strong correlation among
features of a generic EM problem to considerably reduce the dimensionality of
the problem and thus, the computational complexity, without imposing
considerable errors. By employing the dimensionality reduction concept using
the more recently demonstrated autoencoder technique, we redefine the
conventional many-to-one design problem in EM nanostructures into a one-to-one
problem plus a much simpler many-to-one problem, which can be simply solved
using an analytic formulation. This approach reduces the computational
complexity in solving both the forward problem (i.e., analysis) and the inverse
problem (i.e., design) by orders of magnitude compared to conventional
approaches. In addition, it provides analytic formulations that, despite their
complexity, can be used to obtain intuitive understanding of the physics and
dynamics of EM wave interaction with nanostructures with minimal computation
requirements. As a proof-of-concept, we applied such an efficacious method to
design a new class of on-demand reconfigurable optical metasurfaces based on
phase-change materials (PCM). We envision that the integration of such a
DL-based technique with full-wave commercial software packages offers a
powerful toolkit to facilitate the analysis, design, and optimization of the EM
nanostructures as well as explaining, understanding, and predicting the
observed responses in such structures.

high-pressure ice and liquid water/ice I layers. Results. We show that
TRAPPIST-1d and e can avoid entering a runaway greenhouse state. Planet e is
the most likely to support a habitable environment, with Earth-like surface

trigger a runaway greenhouse and support volcanism on the surfaces of their

for smart contract portability that permits any user to migrate contract logic

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is supported by a multitude of blockchain

We provide a toolbox that facilitates smart contract portability between
EVM-compatible blockchains without trust requirements in the entity executing

core) systems revealed a nontrivial effect of the core excitation: the transfer
cross section cannot be factorized into the spectroscopic factor and the
single-particle cross section obtained neglecting the core excitation. This
observable, up to a kinematic factor, is the angular distribution of the core
nucleus in the $(p,d)$ reaction. The study of the core excitation effect for
the most closely related observable in the $(p,pn)$ three-body breakup, i.e.,
the core angular distribution, is aimed in the present work. Breakup of the
one-neutron halo nucleus in the collision with the proton is described using
three-body Faddeev-type equations extended to include the excitation of the
nuclear core. The integral equations for transition operators are solved in the
momentum-space partial-wave representation. Breakup of 11Be nucleus as well as
of model $A=11$ $p$-wave nuclei is studied at beam energies of 30, 60, and 200
MeV per nucleon. Angular and momentum distributions for the 10Be core in ground
and excited states is calculated. In sharp contrast to $(p,d)$ reactions, the
differential cross section in most cases factorizes quite well into the
spectroscopic factor and the single-particle cross section. Due to different
reaction mechanisms the core excitation effect in the breakup is very different
from transfer reactions. A commonly accepted approach to evaluate the cross
section, i.e., the rescaling of single-particle model results by the
corresponding spectroscopic factor, appears to be reliable for breakup though
it fails in general for transfer reactions.

telescopes is zenith angle dependent. This effect originates from the
increasing geometrical distance of the observed shower to the telescope with
increasing zenith distance. This paper investigates how this alters the
observed image and how this affects the trigger rate as a function of zenith
angle. The discussed effects include the change of Cherenkov light yield, of
absorption in the atmosphere, of photon density at the aperture and of the
image size at the focal plane of the telescope. Based on a simple model for the
atmosphere and well-known first principles on the development of extensive
air-showers, the zenith angle dependence is expressed analytically. The
assumption that most light is emitted from the shower core and mathematical
approximations allow to derive an analytical expression describing the zenith
angle dependence well with only three free parameters which are directly linked
with the underlying physics. This suggests further investigations about how
these fit parameters are linked to the properties of the atmosphere and the
instrument. Using data published by the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope, a good
match of the fit functions with the data is obtained. For the trigger rate of
cosmic rays, the obtained parameters are consistent with the naive expectation.

variability, as well as a higher granularity. To fulfil those requirements, we
look at more flexible similarity measures. In this work, we present a novel,
flexible, end-to-end trainable network for large-scale data hashing. Our method
works by transforming the data distribution to behave as a uniform distribution
on a product of spheres. The transformed data is subsequently hashed to a
binary form in a way that maximises entropy of the output, (i.e. to fully
utilise the available bit-rate capacity) while maintaining the correctness
(i.e. close items hash to the same key in the map). We show that the method
outperforms baseline approaches such as locality-sensitive hashing and product
quantisation in the limited capacity regime.

advantage that the life time of the lamp is longer whereas the number of useful
lines is lower. We investigate the number of suitable spectral lines depending
on the current used and obtained spectra of a ThNe HCL coupled by a fibre to
the Tautenburg Echelle spectrograph in a setting that is typical for many
high-resolution spectrographs. Operating currents were chosen in the range
specified by the manufacturer. We varied exposure time to identify the
saturation level and effects of noise. A few thousands of Th lines were
identified automatically in the wavelength range considered. We noticed a
scatter of several hundred ms$^{-1}$ of Th lines when varying the settings but
did not detect any systematic trends. The scatter in wavelength residuals of Th
lines however indicates that a precise control of operating current can be
necessary. An estimation of the calibration precision of individual lines
indicates that a combination of strong Th lines allows one to reach a level of
1$\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$. Although a high operating current reduces the life-time of
the lamp and accelerates its ageing it guarantees highest precision because of
the numerous Th lines which become strong compared to the Ne lines. Then,
noise, saturation, wavelength residuals of lines identified, and the pollution
due to saturated Ne lines can be minimised by adjusting exposure time. Our
results indicate that ThNe lamps can be better suited than ThAr lamps for all
kinds of studies that involve the precise measurement of radial velocity
variations, e.g. studies on late-type stars, brown dwarfs, objects that suffer
from strong extinction, or high-redshift galaxies.

facilitate different types of similarity search, such as Query-by-Example or

able to simulate deterministic Turing machines working in polynomial time with
a weaker uniformity condition and using only one level of membrane nesting.
This allows us to embed this construction into more complex membrane

twice-differentiable function on $M$, with unique global minimum at $x^* \in
M$. The idea of the present work is to replace the problem of searching for the
global minimum of $U$, by the problem of finding the Riemannian barycentre of
the Gibbs distribution $P_{\scriptscriptstyle{T}} \propto \exp(-U/T)$. In other
words, instead of minimising the function $U$ itself, to minimise
$\mathcal{E}_{\scriptscriptstyle{T}}(x) = \frac{1}{2}\int d^{\scriptscriptstyle
2}(x,z)P_{\scriptscriptstyle{T}}(dz)$, where $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ denotes
Riemannian distance. The following original result is proved : if $U$ is
invariant by geodesic symmetry about $x^*$, then for each $\delta < \frac{1}{2}
r_{\scriptscriptstyle cx}$ ($r_{\scriptscriptstyle cx}$ the convexity radius of
$M$), there exists $T_{\scriptscriptstyle \delta}$ such that $T \leq
T_{\scriptscriptstyle \delta}$ implies $\mathcal{E}_{\scriptscriptstyle{T}}$ is
strongly convex on the geodesic ball $B(x^*,\delta)\,$, and $x^*$ is the unique
global minimum of $\mathcal{E}_{\scriptscriptstyle{T\,}}$. Moreover, this
$T_{\scriptscriptstyle \delta}$ can be computed explicitly. This result gives
rise to a general algorithm for black-box optimisation, which is briefly
described, and will be further explored in future work.

star formation in galaxies. We find that SN feedback operates on all scales
from the interstellar medium (ISM) to several virial radii. SNe regulate star
formation by preventing condensation of HI into H$_2$ and by moving cold
neutral gas to the hot HII phase. The first effect explains why the cold
neutral gas in dwarf galaxies forms stars inefficiently. The second maintains
the hot ISM of massive galaxies (HII vents out at lower masses). At $v_{\rm
vir}\simeq 67{\rm\,km\,s}^{-1}$, the outflow rate follows the relation:
$\dot{M}_{\rm out}=23\,(v_{\rm vir}/67{\rm\,km\,s}^{-1})^{-4.6}\,{\rm SFR}$.
$20\%$ to $70\%$ of the gas expelled from galaxies escapes from the halo
(ejective feedback) but outflows are dominated by cold swept-up gas, most of
which falls back onto the galaxy on a $\sim 1\,$Gyr timescale. This `fountain
feedback' reduces the masses of galaxies by a factor of two to four, since gas
spends half to three quarter of its time in the fountain. Less than $10\%$ of
the ejected gas mixes with the hot circumgalactic medium and this gas is
usually not reaccreted. On scales as large as $6r_{\rm vir}$, galactic winds
divert the incoming gas from cosmic filaments and prevent if from accreting
onto galaxies (pre-emptive feedback). This process is the main reason for the
low baryon content of ultradwarves.

continuum and line radiative transfer of thermochemical disk models is too
time-consuming to carry out large parameter studies. Simpler approaches using a
slab model to fit continuum-subtracted spectra require the identification of
either the global or local continuum. Continuum subtraction, particularly when
covering a broad wavelength range, is challenging but critical in rich
molecular spectra as hot (several hundreds K) molecular emission lines can also
produce a pseudo continuum. In this work, we present CLIcK, a flexible tool to
simultaneously fit the continuum and line emission. The DDN01 continuum model
(Dullemond et al. 2001) and a plane-parallel slab of gas in local thermodynamic
equilibrium are adopted to simulate the continuum and line emission
respectively, both of them are fast enough for homogeneous studies of large

localised domain walls (LDW) under similar conditions [see, e.g., H. Hinsch and

uncover smooth transitions between LDW and DDW; the latter mimics DDWs in an
open TASEP, controlled essentially by the fluctuations in the diffusive

stage of the turbulence, the energy diffusion is between the Bohm scaling and
gyro-Bohm scaling. At later time, the observed diffusion is closer to the
gyro-Bohm scaling, and density blobs generated by the rupture of unstable modes

and periods of $17.01$d and $34.57$d, respectively. Anti-correlated TTVs are
clearly evident indicating that the transiters orbit the same star and interact

model, we infer masses of $26_{-11}^{+24} M_{\oplus}$ and $190_{-80}^{+220}

likely sub-Kronian and Kronian densities. TOI-216 lies close to the southern
ecliptic pole and thus will be observed by TESS throughout the first year,
providing an opportunity for continuous dynamical monitoring and considerable
refinement of the dynamical masses presented here. TOI-216 closely resembles
Kepler-9 in architecture, and we hypothesize that in such systems these

system before becoming trapped into resonance, which would imply that future
detections of new analogs may also have sub-Jupiter masses.

cracks along the weld bead, which can be eliminated by using a pre-heating step
to reduce thermal straining. In this study, based on the tungsten inert gas
welding process, a working envelope, focussed on varying welding speed and five
different shielding gas mixtures of argon and helium, has been defined with the
view of producing crack-free autogenous welds. The bead appearance and the
microstructure of the different welds were correlated to the welding
parameters, whose main effects have been analysed. Welding defects such as
humping occurred when using gas mixtures with relatively low content of helium,
and when using relatively high welding speeds. Crack-free autogenous welds have
been produced without pre-heating when using a high content of helium and
relatively low welding speeds. Thus, this study has demonstrated that a
helium-rich shielding gas is required for welding thick tungsten plates.
Moreover, the low thermal shock induced by the process, coupled with the purity
of the tungsten plates used, strongly contributed to avoid the occurrence of
any crack.

cosmological parameters that determine the cosmic properties must fall within a
range of values in order for the universe to develop astrophysical structures
and ultimately support life. This paper reviews current constraints on these
quantities. The standard model of particle physics contains both coupling
constants and particle masses, and the allowed ranges of these parameters are
discussed first. We then consider cosmological parameters, including the total
energy density, the vacuum energy density, the baryon-to-photon ratio, the dark
matter contribution, and the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations.
These quantities are constrained by the requirements that the universe lives
for a long time, emerges from the BBN epoch with an acceptable chemical
composition, and can successfully produce galaxies. On smaller scales, stars
and planets must be able to form and function. The stars must have sufficiently
long lifetimes and hot surface temperatures. The planets must be massive enough
to maintain an atmosphere, small enough to remain non-degenerate, and contain
enough particles to support a complex biosphere. These requirements place
constraints on the gravitational constant, the fine structure constant, and
composite parameters that specify nuclear reaction rates. We consider specific
instances of possible fine-tuning in stars, including the triple alpha reaction
that produces carbon, as well as the effects of unstable deuterium and stable
diprotons. For all of these issues, viable universes exist over a range of
parameter space, which is delineated herein. Finally, for universes with
significantly different parameters, new types of astrophysical processes can
generate energy and support habitability.

binary interaction and show that if the companion were to launch jets while
interacting with the giant primary star's envelope, the jets would remove a
substantial fraction of the envelope's gas. We use the setup and numerical code
of an earlier common envelope study that did not include jets, with a 0.88Mo,
83Ro red giant star and a 0.3Mo companion. The assumption is that the companion
star accretes mass via an accretion disk that is responsible for launching the
jets which, in the simulations, are injected numerically. For the first time we
conduct simulations that include jets as well as the gravitational energy
released by the inspiraling core-companion system. We find that simulations
with jets unbind approximately three times as much envelope mass than identical
simulations that do not include jets, though the total fraction of unbound gas
remains below 50 per cent for these particular simulations. The jets generate
high velocity outflows in the polar directions. The jets also increase the
final core-companion orbital separation and lead to a kick velocity of the
core-companion binary system. Our results show that, if able to form, jets
could play a crucial role in ejecting the envelope and in shaping the outflow.

magnetic orders at finite temperatures down to the ML limit. They also exhibit
strong MO effects with their Kerr and Faraday rotation angles being comparable

whether two polyadic decompositions of a given matrix multiplication tensor are

decompositions of several matrix multiplication tensors. This analysis is
relevant for the study of fast matrix multiplication as it relates to the
question of how many essentially different fast matrix multiplication
algorithms there exist. This question has been first studied by de~Groote, who
showed that for the multiplication of $2\times2$ matrices with $7$ active
multiplications, all algorithms are essentially equivalent to Strassen's
algorithm. In contrast, the results of our analysis show that for the
multiplication of larger matrices, (e.g., $2\times3$ by $3\times2$ or
$3\times3$ by $3\times3$ matrices), two decompositions are very likely to be
essentially different. We further provide a necessary criterion for a polyadic

entries. Decompositions with specific integer entries, e.g., powers of two,
provide fast matrix multiplication algorithms with better efficiency and
stability properties. This condition can be tested algorithmically and we
present the conclusions obtained for the decompositions of small/medium matrix
multiplication tensors.

large fraction of cosmologists. However, the validity of a scientific model is
not decided by counting the number of its supporters and, therefore, this
dominance cannot be taken as a proof of its correctness. Throughout its
history, many criticisms have been put forward against inflation. The final
publication of the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background data represents a
benchmark time to study their relevance and to decide whether inflation really
deserves its supremacy. In this paper, we categorize the criticisms against
inflation, go through all of them in the light of what is now observationally
known about the early universe, and try to infer and assess the scientific
status of inflation. Although we find that important questions still remain
open, we conclude that the inflationary paradigm is not in trouble but, on the
contrary, has rather been strengthened by the Planck data.

Continuum (LyC) emitter. Recently, 11 LyC-leaking GPs have been detected
through direct observations of the ionizing continuum, making this the most
abundant class of confirmed LyC-emitters at any redshift. High resolution,
multi-wavelength studies of GPs can lead to an understanding of the method(s),
through which LyC escapes from these galaxies. The proximity of Mrk 71/NCG 2366
offers unprecedented detail on the inner workings of a GP analog, and enables
us to identify the mechanisms of LyC escape. We use 5825-7650{\AA} integral
field unit PMAS observations to study the kinematics and physical conditions in
Mrk 71. An electron density map is obtained from the [S II] ratio. A fortuitous
second order contamination by the [O II]3727 doublet enables the construction
of an electron temperature map. Resolved maps of sound speed, thermal
broadening, ""true"" velocity dispersion, and Mach number are obtained and
compared to the high resolution magneto-hydrodynamic SILCC simulations. Two
regions of increased velocity dispersion indicative of outflows are detected to
the north and south of the super star cluster, knot B, with redshifted and
blueshifted velocities, respectively. We confirm the presence of a faint broad
kinematical component, which is seemingly decoupled from the outflow regions,
and is fainter and narrower than previously reported in the literature. Within
uncertainties, the low- and high-ionization gas move together. Outside of the
core of Mrk 71, an increase in Mach numbers is detected, implying a decrease in
gas density. Simulations suggest this drop in density can be as high as ~4 dex,
down to almost optically thin levels, which would imply a non-zero LyC escape
fraction along the outflows... [abridged]

problem modeling the growth of necrotic tumors. A remarkable feature of this
free boundary problem is that it contains two different-type free surfaces: One
is the tumor surface whose evolution is governed by an evolution equation and
the other is the interface between the living shell of the tumor and the
necrotic core which is an obstacle-type free surface, i.e., its evolution is
not governed by an evolution equation but instead is determined by some
stationary-type equation. In mathematics, the inner free surface is induced by
discontinuity of the nonlinear reaction functions in this model, which causes
the main difficulty of analysis of this free boundary problem. Previous work on
this model studies spherically symmetric situation which is in essence an
one-dimension free boundary problem. The purpose of this paper is to make
rigorous analysis in general spherically asymmetric situation. By applying the
Nash-Moser implicit function theorem, we prove that the inner free surface is
smooth and depends on the outer free surface smoothly when it is a small
perturbation of the surface of a sphere. By applying this result and some
abstract results for parabolic differential equations in Banach manifolds we
prove that the unique radial stationary solution of this free boundary problem
is asymptotically stable under small non-radial perturbations.

this paper, we propose a model for video streaming systems, typically composed
of a centralized origin server, several CDN sites, and edge-caches located
closer to the end user. We comprehensively consider different systems design
factors including the limited caching space at the CDN sites, allocation of CDN
for a video request, choice of different ports (or paths) from the CDN and the
central storage, bandwidth allocation, the edge-cache capacity, and the caching
policy. We focus on minimizing a performance metric, stall duration tail
probability (SDTP), and present a novel and efficient algorithm accounting for
the multiple design flexibilities. The theoretical bounds with respect to the
SDTP metric are also analyzed and presented. The implementation on a
virtualized cloud system managed by Openstack demonstrate that the proposed

automate this process by translating network architectures specified in Keras

so, we propose a visual grammar for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which
has been derived from an analysis of such figures extracted from all ICCV and

structure of accretion flows with comparable radiation and gas pressures. We
consider two separate energy equations for matter and radiation in the
diffusion limit. In order to solve the set of radiation hydrodynamic equations
in steady state and axisymmetric configuration, we employ self-similar
technique in the radial direction. We need the reflection symmetry about the
mid-plane to find gas density at the equator. For a typical solution, we assume
that the gas pressure has 10-50\% portion of the total pressure. In this paper,
since the radiation energy is involved directly, we are able to estimate how
much energy of viscous heating is transported in the radial direction and
advected towards the central object. Our results show that although the mass
accretion rate does not approach the Eddington limit, the energy advection is
rather high. Moreover, in a disc with greater accretion rate and less portion
of gas pressure at the total pressure, more energy is advected to its center.
In addition, as we expect the accretion flow becomes thicker with greater
values of gas pressure. Based on Solberg-H\~A\v{z}iland conditions, we notice
that the flow is convectively stable in all parts of such a disc.

labelled training data, without which they are prone to overfitting, not
generalizing well to unseen images. In practice, obtaining a large number of
annotations from clinical experts is expensive and time-consuming. One way to
address scarcity of annotated examples is data augmentation using random
spatial and intensity transformations. Recently, it has been proposed to use
generative models to synthesize realistic training examples, complementing the
random augmentation. So far, these methods have yielded limited gains over the
random augmentation. However, there is potential to improve the approach by (i)
explicitly modeling deformation fields (non-affine spatial transformation) and
intensity transformations and (ii) leveraging unlabelled data during the
generative process. With this motivation, we propose a novel task-driven data
augmentation method where to synthesize new training examples, a generative
network explicitly models and applies deformation fields and additive intensity
masks on existing labelled data, modeling shape and intensity variations,
respectively. Crucially, the generative model is optimized to be conducive to
the task, in this case segmentation, and constrained to match the distribution
of images observed from labelled and unlabelled samples. Furthermore, explicit
modeling of deformation fields allow synthesizing segmentation masks and images
in exact correspondence by simply applying the generated transformation to an
input image and the corresponding annotation. Our experiments on cardiac
magnetic resonance images (MRI) showed that, for the task of segmentation in
small training data scenarios, the proposed method substantially outperforms
conventional augmentation techniques.

  A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in
the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses $O(\epsilon^{-2})$
samples from $p$ and outputs~$q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p)
\leq 3\cdot\mathsf{opt} + \epsilon$, where $\mathsf{opt}=

one or a few individuals developed skills for celestial observations, the

service instances over geographically distributed data centers and providing
inter-connectivity among them. The goal is to enable the network traffic to
flow smoothly through the underlying network, resulting in an optimal quality
of experience to the end-users. Proper chaining of network functions leads to
optimal utilization of distributed resources. This has been a de-facto model in
the telecom industry with network functions deployed over underlying hardware.
Though this model has served the telecom industry well so far, it has been
adapted mostly to suit the static behavior of network services and service
demands due to the deployment of the services directly over physical resources.
This results in network ossification with larger delays to the end-users,
especially with the data-centric model in which the computational resources are
moving closer to end users. A novel networking paradigm, Network Function
Virtualization (NFV), meets the user demands dynamically and reduces
operational expenses (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx), by implementing
network functions in the software layer known as virtual network functions
(VNFs). VNFs are then interconnected to form a complete end-to-end service,
also known as service function chains (SFCs). In this work, we study the
problem of deploying service function chains over network function virtualized
architecture. Specifically, we study virtual network function placement problem
for the optimal SFC formation across geographically distributed clouds. We set
up the problem of minimizing inter-cloud traffic and response time in a
multi-cloud scenario as an ILP optimization problem, along with important
constraints such as total deployment costs and service level agreements (SLAs).
We consider link delays and computational delays in our model.

Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security (FCAPS) framework
for the virtual network services. In NFV, faults and performance issues can
have complex geneses within virtual resources as well as virtual networks and
cannot be effectively handled by traditional rule-based systems. To tackle the
above problem, we propose a fault detection and localization model based on a
combination of shallow and deep learning structures. Relatively simpler
detection of 'fault' and 'no-fault' conditions or 'manifest' and 'impending'
faults have been effectively shown to be handled by shallow machine learning
structures like Support Vector Machine (SVM). Deeper structure, i.e. the
stacked autoencoder has been found to be useful for a more complex localization

different layers, to get to the root cause of the problem. We provide
evaluation results using a dataset adapted from logs of disruption in an

radio base stations and to install them in a centralized infrastructure, such
as a cloud, for statistical multiplexing gains. The technology is known as
Cloud Radio Access Network (CRAN). Since cloud computing is gaining significant
traction and virtualized data centers are becoming popular as a cost-effective
infrastructure in the telecommunication industry, CRAN is being heralded as a
candidate technology to meet the expectations of radio access networks for 5G.
In CRANs, low energy base stations (BSs) are deployed over a small geographical
location and are connected to a cloud via finite capacity backhaul links.
Baseband processing unit (BBU) functions are implemented on the virtual
machines (VMs) in the cloud over commodity hardware. Such functions, built-in
software, are termed as virtual functions (VFs). The optimized placement of VFs
is necessary to reduce the total delays and minimize the overall costs to
operate CRANs. Our study considers the problem of optimal VF placement over
distributed virtual resources spread across multiple clouds, creating a
centralized BBU cloud. We propose a combinatorial optimization model and the
use of two heuristic approaches, which are, branch-and-bound (BnB) and
simulated annealing (SA) for the proposed optimal placement. In addition, we
propose enhancements to the standard BnB heuristic and compare the results with
standard BnB and SA approaches. The proposed enhancements improve the quality
of the solution in terms of latency and cost as well as reduce the execution
complexity significantly.

virtualization technologies, novel networking paradigms such as network
function virtualization (NFV) and the Internet of things (IoT) are rapidly
gaining ground. Development of IoT as well as 5G networks and explosion in
online services has resulted in an exponential growth of devices connected to
the network. As a result, application service providers (ASPs) and Internet
service providers (ISPs) are being confronted with the unprecedented challenge
of accommodating increasing service and traffic demands from the geographically
distributed users. To tackle this problem, many ASPs and ISPs, such as Netflix,
Facebook, AT&T and others are increasingly adopting micro-services (MS)
application architecture. Despite the success of MS in the industry, there is
no specific standard or research work for service providers as guidelines,
especially from the perspective of basic micro-service operations. In this
work, we aim to bridge this gap between industry and academia and discuss
different micro-service deployment, discovery and communication options for
service providers as a means to forming complete service chains. In addition,
we address the problem of scheduling micro-services across multiple clouds,
including micro-clouds. We consider different user-level SLAs, such as latency
and cost, while scheduling such services. We aim to reduce overall turnaround
time as well as costs for the deployment of complete end-to-end service. In
this work, we present a novel affinity-based fair weighted scheduling heuristic
to solve this problem. We also compare the results of proposed solution with
standard greedy scheduling algorithms presented in the literature and observe
significant improvements.

Acquisition (SCADA) system testbed used for cybersecurity research. The testbed
consists of a water storage tank's control system, which is a stage in the
process of water treatment and distribution. Sophisticated cyber-attacks were
conducted against the testbed. During the attacks, the network traffic was
captured, and features were extracted from the traffic to build a dataset for
training and testing different machine learning algorithms. Five traditional
machine learning algorithms were trained to detect the attacks: Random Forest,
Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and KNN. Then, the trained
machine learning models were built and deployed in the network, where new tests
were made using online network traffic. The performance obtained during the
training and testing of the machine learning models was compared to the
performance obtained during the online deployment of these models in the
network. The results show the efficiency of the machine learning models in
detecting the attacks in real time. The testbed provides a good understanding
of the effects and consequences of attacks on real SCADA environments

complex 3D objects with extreme flexibility, which is currently undergoing
rapid expansions in terms of materials, functionalities, as well as areas of
application. When attempting to print 3D microstructures in glass, femtosecond
laser induced chemical etching (FLICE) has proved itself a powerful approach.
Here, we demonstrate fabrication of macro-scale 3D glass objects of large
heights up to ~3.8 cm with a well-balanced (i.e., lateral vs longitudinal)
spatial resolution of ~20 {\mu}m. The remarkable accomplishment is achieved by
revealing an unexplored regime in the interaction of ultrafast laser pulses
with fused silica which results in aberration-free focusing of the laser pulses
deeply inside fused silica.
