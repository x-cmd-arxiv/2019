materials is the interatomic potential used to calculate the forces on the
atoms. Great effort and ingenuity is required to construct viable functional
forms and find accurate parameterizations for potentials using traditional
approaches. Machine-learning has emerged as an effective alternative approach
to develop accurate and robust interatomic potentials. Starting with a very
general model form, the potential is learned directly from a database of
electronic structure calculations and therefore can be viewed as a multiscale
link between quantum and classical atomistic simulations. Risk of inaccurate
extrapolation exists outside the narrow range of time- and length-scales where
the two methods can be directly compared. In this work, we use the Spectral
Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP) and show how a fit can be produced with
minimal interpolation errors which is also robust in extrapolating beyond
training. To demonstrate the method, we have developed a new tungsten-beryllium
potential suitable for the full range of binary compositions. Subsequently,
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations were performed of high energy Be
atom implantation onto the (001) surface of solid tungsten. The new machine
learned W-Be potential generates a population of implantation structures
consistent with quantum calculations of defect formation energies. A very
shallow (<2nm) average Be implantation depth is predicted which may explain
ITER diverter degradation in the presence of beryllium.

for encoding light field images (LFI) that is suitable for interactive
rendering. Our method combines two different approaches, motion compensation
schemes and hierarchical compression methods, to exploit redundancies in LFI.
The motion compensation schemes capture the redundancies in local regions of
the LFI efficiently (local coherence) and hierarchical schemes capture the
redundancies present across the entire LFI (global coherence). Our hybrid
approach combines the two schemes effectively capturing both local as well as
global coherence to improve the overall compression rate. We compute a tree
from LFI using a hierarchical scheme and use phase shifted motion compensation
techniques at each level of the hierarchy. Our representation provides random
access to the pixel values of the light field, which makes it suitable for
interactive rendering applications using a small run-time memory footprint. Our
approach is GPU friendly and allows parallel decoding of LF pixel values. We
highlight the performance on the two-plane parameterized light fields and
obtain a compression ratio of 30-800X with a PSNR of 40-45 dB. Overall, we
observe a 2-5X improvement in compression rates using HMLFC over prior light
field compression schemes that provide random access capability. In practice,
our algorithm can render new views of resolution 512X512 on an NVIDIA GTX-980
at ~200 fps.

cyber-physical systems. It captures the plausible deniability of the system's
secret behavior in the presence of an intruder that may access the information
flow. Existing works on opacity only consider non-metric systems by assuming
that the intruder can always distinguish two different outputs precisely. In
this paper, we extend the concept of opacity to systems whose output sets are
equipped with metrics. Such systems are widely used in the modeling of many
real-world systems whose measurements are physical signals. A new concept
called approximate opacity is proposed in order to quantitatively evaluate the
security guarantee level with respect to the measurement precision of the
intruder. Then we propose a new simulation-type relation, called approximate
opacity preserving simulation relation, which characterizes how close two
systems are in terms of the satisfaction of approximate opacity. This allows us
to verify approximate opacity for large-scale, or even infinite systems, using
their abstractions. We also discuss how to construct approximate opacity
preserving symbolic models for a class of discrete-time control systems. Our
results extend the definitions and analysis techniques for opacity from
non-metric systems to metric systems.

his utility by misreporting his type. We do so by first measuring the maximum
utility an agent can gain by misreporting his type on average over the samples,
assuming his true and reported types are from a finite subset---which our
technique constructs---of the type space. The challenge is that by measuring
utility gains over a finite subset of the type space, we might miss type pairs
$\theta$ and $\hat{\theta}$ where an agent with type $\theta$ can greatly
improve his utility by reporting type $\hat{\theta}$. Indeed, our primary
technical contribution is proving that the maximum utility gain over this

Using high spatial resolution interferometric measurements from MIDI instrument
(N-band) on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, we analysed the disc size,
the time-variability of the disc's thermal emission, and the spectral shape of
the $10~\mu$m silicate feature. By fitting simple disc models, we determined
the inclination and the mid-infrared size of the disc, confirming earlier
results based on a lower number of observations. We searched for mid-infrared
temporal variability of different regions of the disc, and concluded that its
morphology is not experiencing significant changes over the observed epochs. We
characterized the mid-infrared silicate feature by determining the feature
amplitude and the $11.3/9.8~\mu$m flux ratio. The latter parameter is a good
indicator of the grain size. The shape of the feature suggests the presence of
crystalline silicate grains in the disc. The interferometric data revealed a
strong radial trend in the mineralogy: while the disc's innermost region seems
to be dominated by forsterite grains, at intermediate radii both forsterite and
enstatite may be present. The outer disc may predominantly contain amorphous
silicate particles. A comparison of the observed spectral shape with that of a
sample of intermediate-mass stars (supergiants, Herbig Ae/Be stars,

correlation is seen between solar activity, as measured with the 10.7 cm flux,

therefore the length and maximum brightness of meteors; a larger scale height
near solar maximum leads to longer, fainter meteors and therefore lower rates.
A weaker negative correlation was observed with geomagnetic activity as

up to 20 MeV, and partly beyond, is proposed. The underlying intrinsic shape of
the nucleus is tetrahedral, as in the na\""ive alpha-particle model and other
cluster models, and A, E and F vibrational phonons are included. The A- and
F-phonons are treated in the harmonic approximation, but the E-vibrations are
extended into a two-dimensional E-manifold of D2-symmetric, four-alpha-particle
configurations, following earlier work. This allows for the underlying
tetrahedral configuration to deform through a square configuration into the
dual tetrahedron, so there is tunnelling between the tetrahedron and its dual,
with the associated breaking of parity doubling. However, E-manifold states can
still be interpreted in terms of E-phonons. Rotational excitations of the
vibrational states are analysed as in the classic work of Dennison, Robson and
others, with centrifugal corrections to the rotational energy spectrum
included. States with F-phonons require Coriolis corrections too. The
first-excited $0^+$ state at 6.05 MeV is modelled as a state with two
E-phonons; this allows a good fit of the lowest $2^+$ and $2^-$ states as
excitations with one E-phonon. The Coriolis parameter $\zeta$ is chosen
positive to ensure the right splitting of the $3^+$ and $3^-$ states near 11
MeV. Altogether, about 80 states with isospin zero are predicted below 20 MeV,
and these match rather well the more than 60 experimentally tabulated states.
Several high-spin states are predicted, up to spin 9 and energy 30 MeV, and
these match some of the high-spin, natural parity states in this energy range
that have been observed. The model proposed here is mainly phenomenological but
it receives some input from analysis of Skyrmions with baryon number 16.

problem on toy-sized datasets, some issues remain to be tackled to apply them
to real-world problem domains. First, a continual learning model should
effectively handle catastrophic forgetting and be efficient to train even with
a large number of tasks. Secondly, it needs to tackle the problem of
order-sensitivity, where the performance of the tasks largely varies based on
the order of the task arrival sequence, as it may cause serious problems where
fairness plays a critical role (e.g. medical diagnosis). To tackle these
practical challenges, we propose a novel continual learning method that is
scalable as well as order-robust, which instead of learning a completely shared
set of weights, represents the parameters for each task as a sum of task-shared
and sparse task-adaptive parameters. With our Additive Parameter Decomposition
(APD), the task-adaptive parameters for earlier tasks remain mostly unaffected,
where we update them only to reflect the changes made to the task-shared
parameters. This decomposition of parameters effectively prevents catastrophic
forgetting and order-sensitivity, while being computation- and
memory-efficient. Further, we can achieve even better scalability with APD
using hierarchical knowledge consolidation, which clusters the task-adaptive
parameters to obtain hierarchically shared parameters. We validate our network
with APD, APD-Net, on multiple benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art
continual learning methods, which it largely outperforms in accuracy,
scalability, and order-robustness.

a three-phase astrochemical model that simulates the chemical evolution of ices

$\Lambda$. These results remain valid for representation-infinite algebras. For
this we introduce the Yoneda category $\mathcal{Y}$ of $\Lambda$ as the
additive closure of the shifts of the $\Lambda$-modules in the derived category
$\mathrm{D^b}(\mathrm{mod}\,\Lambda)$. We show that $\mathcal{Y}$ is coherent
and Gorenstein of self-injective dimension at most $1$, and the singularity
category of $\mathcal{Y}$ is triangle equivalent to the derived category
$\mathrm{D^b}(\mathrm{mod}\,(\underline{\mathrm{mod}}\,\Lambda))$ of the stable
category $\underline{\mathrm{mod}}\,\Lambda$. To give a triangle equivalence,
we apply the theory of realization functors. We show that any algebraic
triangulated category has an f-category over itself by formulating the filtered
derived category of a DG category, which assures the existence of a realization
functor.

smallest precipitate, the dislocations pass the obstacles by depositing
dislocation segments in the disordered interphase boundary rather than shearing
the precipitate or leaving Orowan loops in the matrix around the precipitate.
An absorbed dislocation increases the stress necessary for a second dislocation
to pass the precipitate also by absorbing dislocation segments into the
boundary. Replacing the precipitate with a void of identical size and shape
decreases the critical passing stress and work hardening contribution while an
artificially impenetrable Mg$_{17}$Al$_{12}$ precipitate increases both. These
insights will help improve mesoscale models of hardening by incoherent

(0.3 M$_{\oplus}$) that accretes millimeter-sized pebbles from a gaseous disk.
We construct time-dependent spherical envelope models that capture physical
processes not included in existing global hydrodynamic simulations, including
particle size evolution, dust transport, and realistic gas equations of state.
We assume a low enough disk density that pebbles are marginally coupled to the
gas and are trapped efficiently near the core Bondi radius. Pebbles then drift
rapidly enough to experience erosion by sandblasting, mutual collisions, and
sublimation of water ice. We find that pebble fragmentation is more efficient
than dust re-sticking. Therefore the large pebble accretion rate $\dot{M}_p$
needed to build a core of mass > M$_{\oplus}$ leads to a high envelope
metallicity and grain opacity. Above $\dot{M}_p$ $\sim 10^{-7}$
M$_{\oplus}$/yr, and without other luminosity sources, convective motions
expand near the Bondi radius. The warm, dusty, and turbulent envelope buffers
the inward drift of pebble debris: given a turbulent concentration factor
$f_{turb} \geq$ 1 near the lower convective boundary, the core growth rate is
limited to $1 \times 10^{-7} f_{turb}$ M$_{\oplus}$/yr and the e-folding time
3$f_{turb}^{-1}$ Myr. The remainder of the solid debris is expelled as highly
processed silicates. Pebble ice never reaches the core, and the envelope
contains comparable amounts of H2/He and metals. We interpret our results using
simpler steady models and semi-analytical estimates. Future global simulations
incorporating the processes modelled here are needed to understand the
influence of rotation and vertical disk structure.

Further, 2nd generation Mexican Americans show high cultural convergence

understanding of how central binary stars in planetary nebulae evolve and how
this evolution could develop such magnetically active stars like IN Com. We
present 13 Doppler images covering six months in 2017 and use them to measure
the surface differential rotation. Hitherto unpublished photometric data from
between 1989-2017 are presented. We apply Fourier-transformation to both
photometry and spectra. Very high resolution spectra are used to update IN
Com's astrophysical parameters by means of spectral synthesis. Doppler images
show cool and warm spots coexisting with an average surface temperature
contrast of -1000K and +300K with respect to the effective temperature.
Approximately 8% of the surface is covered with cool spots and 3% with warm
spots. A cool polar spot is seen in all images. We found anti-solar surface
differential rotation with a shear coefficient of -0.026+/-0.005 and an
equatorial rotation period of 5.973+/-0.008 d. We reconfirm the 5.9-day
rotation period of the cool star from photometry, radial velocities, and H
alpha line-profile variations. A long-term V-brightness variation with a likely
period of 7.2yr is found. It appears in phase with the orbital radial velocity
of the binary system in the sense brightest at highest velocity and faintest at
lowest velocity. We redetermine [Ba/Fe], [Y/Fe] and [Sr/Fe] ratios and confirm
the overabundance of these s-process elements in the atmosphere of IN Com.

which attains its unique minimum over such a subspace further provides a
sufficient criterion for a pure state to be uniquely determined by its reduced

necessary for it to arise as a non-degenerate ground state of a quasi-local
Hamiltonian, we prove the opposite implication to be false in general, by
exhibiting an explicit analytic counterexample. We show how the problem of
determining whether a quasi-local parent Hamiltonian admitting a given pure
state as its unique ground state is dual, in the sense of semidefinite
programming, to the one of determining whether such a state is uniquely
determined by the quasi-local information. Failure of this dual program to
attain its optimal value is what prevents these two classes of states to

compared to their regular luminosity counterparts in terms of rise and decline
timescales, peak luminosities and overall shapes. It remains unclear whether
this striking variety arises due to a dominant power input mechanism involving
many underlying parameters, or due to contributions by different progenitor
channels. In this work, we propose that a systematic quantitative study of SLSN
lightcurve timescales and shape properties, such as symmetry around peak
luminosity, can be used to characterize these enthralling stellar explosions.
We find that applying clustering analysis on the properties of model SLSN
lightcurves, powered by either a magnetar spin-down or a supernova
ejecta-circumstellar interaction mechanism, can yield a distinction between the
two, especially in terms of lightcurve symmetry. We show that most events in
the observed SLSN sample with well-constrained lightcurves and early detections
strongly associate with clusters dominated by circumstellar interaction models.
Magnetar spin-down models also show association at a lower degree but have
difficulty in reproducing fast-evolving and fully symmetric lightcurves. We
believe this is due to the truncated nature of the circumstellar interaction
shock energy input as compared to decreasing but continuous power input sources
like magnetar spin-down and radioactive Ni-56 decay. Our study demonstrates the
importance of clustering analysis in characterizing SLSNe based on high-cadence
photometric observations that will be made available in the near future by
surveys like LSST, ZTF and Pan-STARRS.

Logistic principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the commonly used tools

model on binary data. The multivariate binary data set is assumed to be the
sign observation of an unobserved quantitative data set, on which a low rank
structure is assumed to exist. However, the standard logistic PCA model (using
exact low rank constraint) is prone to overfitting, which could lead to
divergence of some estimated parameters towards infinity. We propose to fit a
logistic PCA model through non-convex singular value thresholding to alleviate
the overfitting issue. An efficient Majorization-Minimization algorithm is
implemented to fit the model and a missing value based cross validation (CV)
procedure is introduced for the model selection. Our experiments on realistic
simulations of imbalanced binary data and low signal to noise ratio show that
the CV error based model selection procedure is successful in selecting the
proposed model. Furthermore, the selected model demonstrates superior

these characteristics depend only weakly on the strength of the stratification.
Through conditional analysis, we provide evidence that VLCSs modulate the
average TNTI height, affecting consequently the entrainment process.
Furthermore, VLCSs influence the local entrainment velocity and organize the
flow field on both the turbulent and non-turbulent sides of the gravity current
boundary.

proposed swampland conjecture on the inflationary models though constraints on
reheating. If dark matter is assumed to be produced during reheating, the
conjecture will provide further constraints on the dark matter parameter space
through its current relic abundance. As has been pointed out already and also
analyzed in our present paper any successful inflationary scenario is in clear
tension with the aforementioned conjecture in its current form. However
considering the swampland parameters to be free and constrained by the
inflationary observables, we studied in detail its consequence on the reheating
and dark matter phenomenology. We point out the connection between swampland
conjecture and the scalar spectral index $n_s$ by PLANCK within current $2
\sigma$ range, and associated constraints imposed on the reheating temperature

secondary brain damage after traumatic brain injury. Hypertensive episodes are
often diagnosed reactively, leading to late detection and lost time for
intervention planning. A pro-active approach that predicts critical events
several hours ahead of time could assist in directing attention to patients at
risk. Approach: We developed a prediction framework that forecasts onsets of
acute intracranial hypertension in the next 8 hours. It jointly uses cerebral
auto-regulation indices, spectral energies and morphological pulse metrics to
describe the neurological state of the patient. One-minute base windows were
compressed by computing signal metrics, and then stored in a multi-scale
history, from which physiological features were derived. Main results: Our
model predicted events up to 8 hours in advance with alarm recall rates of 90%
at a precision of 30.3% in the MIMIC-III waveform database, improving upon two
baselines from the literature. We found that features derived from
high-frequency waveforms substantially improved the prediction performance over
simple statistical summaries of low-frequency time series, and each of the
three feature classes contributed to the performance gain. The inclusion of
long-term history up to 8 hours was especially important. Significance: Our
results highlight the importance of information contained in high-frequency
waveforms in the neurological intensive care unit. They could motivate future
studies on pre-hypertensive patterns and the design of new alarm algorithms for
critical events in the injured brain.

of modeling the domain on both sides of the wavemaker. In this paper, we
circumvent these hurdles by proposing a volume-preserving inflow-boundary based
Navier-Stokes wave tank. Wave generation and propagation is modeled in a
two-phase PLIC-VOF set-up. Near-exact volume preservation is achieved (at
arbitrarily large steepness) using kinematic stretching that is aimed towards
balancing the streamwise momentum between points lying above and below the
still water level. Numerical damping of steep waves is prevented by using
blended third-order and limiter schemes for momentum advection. In addition, a
mesh stair-stepping strategy has been adopted for modeling non-Cartesian
immersed boundaries on a staggered variable arrangement. The proposed NWT model
is rigorously benchmarked against various wave-propagation scenarios. These
include the simulation of: (a) monochromatic waves of various steepnesses, (b)
monochromatic waves superimposed with free harmonics, (c) irregular waves in
deep water and (d) wave transformation occurring over a submerged trapezoidal
bar. Excellent agreement with analytical, numerical and experimental data is
reported with both validation as well as verification of the proposed NWT model
being established.

hybrid beamforming, where the joint analog and digital beamforming optimization
maximizes the SE. We analyze the SE of the system by keeping the number of
RF-chains low, but placing analog amplifiers at different paths. Conventional
hybrid beamforming architecture uses the amplifiers right after the D2A

effect the SE of hybrid beamforming. We study the optimal placement of the
analog amplifiers and pinpoint the amount of loss in case of misplaced

meaning, in the sense that two sentences with different meanings should not
translate to one and the same sentence in another language. However,
state-of-the-art systems often fail in this regard, particularly in cases where
the source and target languages partition the ""meaning space"" in different
ways. For instance, ""I cut my finger."" and ""I cut my finger off."" describe
different states of the world but are translated to French (by both Fairseq and

whether the finger is detached. More generally, translation systems are
typically many-to-one (non-injective) functions from source to target language,
which in many cases results in important distinctions in meaning being lost in
translation. Building on Bayesian models of informative utterance production,
we present a method to define a less ambiguous translation system in terms of
an underlying pre-trained neural sequence-to-sequence model. This method

especially from z = 1 (29 per cent) to z = 2.1 (10 per cent). By separating the

quenching of galaxies, including the drivers of galactic conformity. The
framework is centred on the statistic $\Delta$, which is defined as the
difference between the observed star-formation state of a galaxy, and a
prediction of its state based on an empirical model of quenching. In
particular, this work uses the average quenching effects of stellar mass and
local density to construct an empirical model of quenching. $\Delta$ is
therefore a residual which reflects the effects of drivers of quenching not
captured by stellar mass and local density, or so-called 'hidden variables'.
Through a toy model, we explore how the statistical properties of $\Delta$ can
be used to learn about the internal and external hidden variables which control
the quenching of a sample of galaxies. We then apply this analysis to a sample
of local galaxies and find that, after accounting for the average quenching
effects of stellar mass and local density, $\Delta$ remains correlated out to
separations of 3 Mpc. Furthermore, we find that external hidden variables
remain important for driving the residual quenching of low-mass galaxies, while
the residual quenching of high-mass galaxies is driven mostly by internal
properties. These results, along with a similar analysis of a semi-analytical
mock catalogue, suggest that it is necessary to consider halo-related
properties as candidates for hidden variables. A preliminary halo-based
analysis indicates that much of the correlation of $\Delta$ can be attributed
to the physics associated with individual haloes.

of the Wheeler-de-Witt patch of the bulk spacetime (CA conjecture). Although
these conjectures are frequently studied in the context of pure Einstein
gravity, from the perspective of string theory it is also natural to consider
models of gravity in which general relativity is perturbed by higher powers of
the Riemann tensor, suppressed by powers of the string length; in a holographic
context, these corrections are dual to corrections in inverse powers of the 't
Hooft coupling. In this paper, we investigate the CV and CA conjectures in two
stringy models of higher-curvature gravity. We find that the CV
complexification rate remains well-behaved, but conversely that these
corrections induce new divergences in the CA complexification rate that are
absent in pure Einstein gravity. These divergences are intrinsically linked to
the singularity, and appear to be generic in higher curvature theories. To the
best of our knowledge, infinities originating at the singularity have not yet
been observed elsewhere in the literature. We argue that these divergences
imply that, in the CA picture, the complexification rate of the boundary theory
is a nonanalytic function of the 't Hooft coupling.

Hole (SMBH), the bound stellar debris rapidly forms an accretion disk. If the
accretion disk is not aligned with the spinning SMBH's equatorial plane, the
disk will be driven into Lense-Thirring precession around the SMBH's spin axis,
possibly affecting the TDE's light curve. We carry out an eigenmode analysis of
such a disk to understand how the disk's warp structure, precession, and
inclination evolution are influenced by the disk's and SMBH's properties. We
find an oscillatory warp may develop as a result of strong non-Keplarian motion
near the SMBH. The global disk precession frequency matches the Lense-Thirring
precession frequency of a rigid disk around a spinning black hole within a
factor of a few when the disk's accretion rate is high, but deviates
significantly at low accretion rates. Viscosity aligns the disk with the SMBH's
equatorial plane over timescales of days to years, depending on the disk's
accretion rate, viscosity, and SMBH's mass. We also examine the effect of
fall-back material on the warp evolution of TDE disks, and find that the
fall-back torque aligns the TDE disk with the SMBH's equatorial plane in a few

constraints on models of TDE emission which rely on the changing disk
orientation with respect to the line of sight to explain observations.

the interface between the hot bubble interior and cooled shell. Our simulations
employ an effective diffusivity to account for turbulent mixing from nonlinear
instabilities that are not captured in 1D. The conductive heat flux into the
shell is balanced by a combination of cooling in the interface and evaporation
of shell gas into the bubble interior. This evaporation increases the density,
and decreases the temperature, of the SB interior by more than an order of
magnitude relative to simulations without conduction. However, most of the
energy conducted into the interface is immediately lost to cooling, reducing
the evaporative mass flux required to balance conduction. As a result, the
evaporation rate is typically a factor of $\sim$3-30 lower than predicted by
the classical similarity solution of Weaver et al. (1977), which neglects
cooling. Blast waves from the first $\sim$30 SNe remain supersonic in the SB
interior because reduced evaporation from the interface lowers the mass they
sweep up in the hot interior. Updating the Weaver solution to include cooling,
we construct a new analytic model to predict the cooling rate, evaporation
rate, and temporal evolution of SBs. The cooling rate, and hence the hot gas
mass, momentum, and energy delivered by SBs, is set by the ambient ISM density
and the efficiency of nonlinear mixing at the bubble/shell interface.

observations of 26 out of the 30 galaxies in the deep CANDELS GOODS-South field
that we identified as passive at z~3-5 by means of a careful and conservative
SED fitting analysis. ALMA data are used to verify the potential contamination
from red, dusty but star--forming sources that could enter the sample due to
similar optical--nearIR colours. With the exception of a few marginal
detections at <3sigma, we could only infer upper limits, both on individual
sources and on the stacks. We translated the ALMA continuum measurements into
corresponding SFRs, using a variety of far-IR models. These SFRs are compared
with those predicted by secondary star-forming solutions of the optical fits
and with the expected position of the star formation Main Sequence. This
analysis confirms the passive nature of 9 candidates with high confidence and
suggests that the classification is correct for at least half of the sample in
a statistical sense. For the remaining sources the analysis remain inconclusive
because available ALMA data is not deep enough, although the stacking results
corroborate their passive nature. Despite the uncertainties, this work provides
decisive support to the existence of passive galaxies beyond z~3.

Non-equilibrium superconductors are often studied using time resolved optical

time domain. We calculate time-resolved optical conductivity of a pumped
superconducting state using a non-equilibrium Keldysh approach. Through
functional derivation, the optical conductivity is obtained with full vertex

of singlet and triplet hyperfine states in the hydrogen gas, which can be

which a sub-GeV dark matter particle with spin-dependent coupling to nucleons

directly, with negligible reduction of the kinetic temperature of the hydrogen

structural parameters together with integrated velocity dispersions and
baryonic masses to statistically constrain the median ratio of intrinsic
ordered to disordered motion, $V/\sigma_{V,0}$. We find that $V/\sigma_{V,0}$
increases with increasing stellar mass and decreasing specific SFR (sSFR).
These trends may reflect marginal disk stability, where systems with higher gas
fractions have thicker disks. For galaxies with detected rotation we assess
trends between their kinematics and mass, sSFR, and baryon surface density
($\Sigma_{\mathrm{bar},e}$). Intrinsic dispersion correlates most with
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{bar},e}$ and velocity correlates most with mass. By comparing
dynamical and baryonic masses, we find that galaxies at $z\sim 1.4-3.8$ are
baryon dominated within their effective radii ($R_E$), with Mdyn/Mbaryon
increasing over time. The inferred baryon fractions within $R_E$,
$f_{\mathrm{bar}}$, decrease over time, even at fixed mass, size, or surface
density. At fixed redshift, $f_{\mathrm{bar}}$ does not appear to vary with
stellar mass but increases with decreasing $R_E$ and increasing
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{bar},e}$. For galaxies at $z\geq2$, the median inferred baryon

rare elsewhere on the sky. Sightlines that are separated by up to 3' show very
similar RMs. Based on this observation, we argue that the Galactic foreground

sources must have very simple distributions of Faraday-rotating and
synchrotron-emitting media. Many sources that emit at a single RM have a
spectral index in linear polarization that is (very) different from the
spectral index in Stokes I. Analysing ratios of flux densities Q/I and U/I (to
correct for spectral index effects) then leads to erroneous results. About 80
per cent of sightlines in our survey are dominated by emission at only one RM.

the chaotic inflation theory of initial conditions ensures that such bound is

use. But the intrinsic differences between codes and methods lead to complex
systematics that depend on multiple variables such as the selected spectral
regions and the radiative transfer code used. I expand iSpec, a popular
open-source spectroscopic tool, to support the most well-known radiative
transfer codes and assess their similarities and biases when using multiple
set-ups based on the equivalent-width method and the synthetic spectral-fitting
technique (interpolating from a pre-computed grid of spectra or synthesizing
with interpolated model atmospheres). This work shows that systematic
differences on atmospheric parameters and abundances between most of the codes

feature selection. However, it may not be possible to ignore the remaining
differences, depending on the particular case and the required precision.
Regarding methods, equivalent-width-based and spectrum-fitting analyses exhibit
large differences that are caused by their intrinsic differences, which is
significant given the popularity of these two methods. The results help to
identify the key caveats of modern spectroscopy that all scientists should be

($M_*=10^9-10^{10}M_{\odot}$) galaxies at high redshift ($z=1.0-2.5$) tend to
be elongated (prolate) rather than disky (oblate) or spheroidal. This is
explained in zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by the fact that
these galaxies are forming in cosmic web filaments where accretion happens
preferentially along the direction of elongation. We ask whether the elongated
morphology of these galaxies allows them to be used as effective tracers of
cosmic web filaments at high redshift via their intrinsic alignments. Using
mock lightcones and spectroscopically-confirmed galaxy pairs from the CANDELS
survey, we test two types of alignments: (1) between the galaxy major axis and
the direction to nearby galaxies of any mass, and (2) between the major axes of
nearby pairs of low-mass, likely prolate, galaxies. The mock lightcones predict
strong signals in 3D real space, 3D redshift space, and 2D projected redshift
space for both types of alignments (assuming prolate galaxy orientations are
the same as those of their host prolate halos), but we do not detect
significant alignment signals in CANDELS observations. However, we show that
spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for only a small fraction of highly
elongated galaxies, and accounting for spectroscopic incompleteness and
redshift errors significantly degrades the 2D mock signal. This may partly
explain the alignment discrepancy and highlights one of several avenues for
future work.

extremely successful in explaining various cosmological observations, exhibit a
number of problems on small scales. One possible way of solving these problems
is to invoke (so-called) warm dark matter (WDM) particles with masses $m_x
\sim$ keV. Since the formation of structure is delayed in such WDM models, it
is natural to expect that they can be constrained using observations related to
the first stars, e.g., the 21 cm signal from cosmic dawn. In this work, we use
a detailed galaxy formation model, Delphi, to calculate the 21 cm signal at
high-redshifts and compare this to the recent EDGES observations. We find that
while CDM and 5 keV WDM models can obtain a 21 cm signal within the observed
redshift range, reproducing the amplitude of the observations requires the
introduction of an excess radio background. On the other hand, WDM models with
$m_x \leq 3$ keV can be ruled out since they are unable to match either the
redshift range or the amplitude of the EDGES signal, irrespective of the
parameters used. Comparable to values obtained from the low-redshift Lyman
Alpha forest, our results extend constraints on the WDM particle to an era
inaccessible by any other means; additional forthcoming 21 cm data from the era
of cosmic dawn will be crucial in refining such constraints.

formation is the regulation of star formation at early times. The relative

direct observational constraints of the gas reservoirs in quenched or quenching
galaxies at high redshift are scant. We present ALMA observations of CO(2-1) in
a massive ($\log M_{\star}/M_{\odot}=11.2$), recently quenched galaxy at
$z=1.522$. The optical spectrum of this object shows strong Balmer absorption
lines, which implies that star formation ceased $\sim$0.8 Gyr ago. We do not
detect CO(2-1) line emission, placing an upper limit on the molecular
$\mathrm{H_2}$ gas mass of 1.1$\times10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$. The implied gas
fraction is $f_{\rm{H_2}}{\equiv M_{H_2}/M_{\star}}<7\%$, $\sim10\times$ lower
than typical star forming galaxies at similar stellar masses at this redshift,
among the lowest gas fractions at this specific star formation rate at any
epoch, and the most stringent constraint on the gas contents of a $z>1$ passive
galaxy to date. Our observations show that the depletion of $\mathrm{H_2}$ from
the interstellar medium of quenched objects can be both efficient and fairly
complete, in contrast to recent claims of significant cold gas in recently
quenched galaxies. We explore the variation in observed gas fractions in
high-$z$ galaxies and show that galaxies with high stellar surface density have
low $f_{\rm{H_2}}$, similar to recent correlations between specific star
formation rate and stellar surface density.

$U(1)$ symmetry living on a boundary. This coupling gives rise to a continuous
family of boundary conformal field theories (BCFT) parametrized by the gauge
coupling $\tau$ in the upper-half plane and by the choice of the CFT in the
decoupling limit $\tau \to \infty$. Upon performing an $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
transformation in the bulk and going to the decoupling limit in the new frame,
one finds a different 3d CFT on the boundary, related to the original one by
Witten's $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ action [1]. In particular the cusps on the real
$\tau$ axis correspond to the 3d gauging of the original CFT. We study general
properties of this BCFT. We show how to express bulk one and two-point
functions, and the hemisphere free-energy, in terms of the two-point functions
of the boundary electric and magnetic currents. We then consider the case in
which the 3d CFT is one Dirac fermion. Thanks to 3d dualities this BCFT is
mapped to itself by a bulk $S$ transformation, and it also admits a decoupling
limit which gives the $O(2)$ model on the boundary. We compute scaling
dimensions of boundary operators and the hemisphere free-energy up to two
loops. Using an $S$-duality improved ansatz, we extrapolate the perturbative
results and find good approximations to the observables of the $O(2)$ model. We
also consider examples with other theories on the boundary, such as large-$N_f$
Dirac fermions --for which the extrapolation to strong coupling can be done
exactly order-by-order in $1/N_f$-- and a free complex scalar.

show that the finite spin gaps in both the VBS phases smoothly vanish at the
phase boundary: a second order phase transition defining a quantum critical
point (QCP). The phase boundary is also captured by the fact that the central
charge is unity at the phase boundary and zero otherwise in the thermodynamic
limit. We further demonstrate that the experimental magnetization curve (which
starts increasing with zero or tiny field) can be reasonably explained only by
assuming the exchange parameters of CuInVO$_5$ to be very close to the phase
boundary. Thus, we argue that CuInVO$_5$ may be a first example material which
at ambient pressure stands near a QCP between two VBS phases. By varying the
balance of exchange interactions with pressure, a transition from N\'eel to
either of the VBS phases could be observed.

1.2 kpc in R_g or 285 kpc km/s in L_z. The pattern shows only weak changes with
Galactocentric radius R and little change in strength in particular with the
vertical energy E_z of the stars or respectively the distance to the Galactic
plane |z|. The pattern is to first order symmetric around the plane, i.e. has
no significant odd terms in z. There is weak phase shift with the pattern
moving towards slightly lower L_z (i.e. trailing) with |z| and E_z. However, we
observe a highly significant phase shift in Galactic azimuth phi, which is
different for different peaks. The peak around L_z ~ 2100 kpc km/s only shows a
weak change with galactic azimuth, while the rest of the pattern shows a
clearly detectable shift of d L_z /d phi = (200 +/- 22) kpc km/s/rad. If we
consider all peaks to belong to the same pattern, this would suggest a
wavenumber m = 4. We further find that the wave-like pattern in U_g appears to
be related to the W vs. L_z pattern detected in Gaia DR1. A comparison of the
U_g-L_z wave pattern with changes of U_g vs. R, which have been previously
discussed, suggests that the latter can be understood as just the U_g-L_z

ranging from distributed information fusion, decision-making, distributed
optimization, to load balancing and decentralized control. Existing distributed
average consensus algorithms require each node to exchange and disclose state
information to its neighbors, which is undesirable in cases where the state is
private or contains sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that avoids disclosing individual state information in average
consensus by letting each node decompose its state into two sub-states. For
each node, one of the two sub-states involves in computation and inter-node
interactions as if it were the original state, while the other sub-state
interacts only with the first sub-state of the same node, being completely
invisible to other nodes. The initial values of the two sub-states are chosen
randomly but with their mean fixed to the initial value of the original state,
which is key to guarantee convergence to the desired consensus value. In direct
contrast to differential-privacy based privacy-preserving average-consensus
approaches which enable privacy by compromising accuracy in the consensus
value, the proposed approach can guarantee convergence to the \emph{exact}
desired value without any error. Not only is the proposed approach able to
prevent the disclosure of a node's initial state to honest-but-curious
neighbors, it can also provide protection against inference by external
eavesdroppers able to wiretap communication links. Numerical simulations
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and its advantages over
state-of-the-art counterparts.

This paper examines a Bayesian nearest neighbor approach for prognostic

weighted Euclidean distance metric to search through an a priori database
populated with coincident GPM radiometer and radar observations as well as

Using the presented approach, we demonstrate that the hit probability of

detecting snowfall than rainfall, on average by 10 percent. In particular, the
probability of precipitation detection and its solid phase increases by 11 and
8 percent, over dry snow cover, when compared to other surface types. The main
reason is found to be related to the ability of the algorithm in capturing the

unable to guarantee their timely delivery. In this paper, we investigate the
problem of joint collaborative content-aware caching and delivery of $360^o$

$360^o$ video encoding in multiple tiles and layers to make fine-grained
decisions regarding which tiles to cache in each Small Base Station (SBS), and
where to deliver them from to the end users, as users may reside in the
coverage area of multiple SBSs. This permits to cache the most popular tiles in
the SBSs, while the remaining tiles may be obtained through the backhaul. In
addition, we explicitly consider the time delivery constraints to ensure
continuous video playback. To reduce the computational complexity of the
optimization problem, we simplify it by introducing a fairness constraint. This
allows us to split the original problem into subproblems corresponding to
Groups of Pictures (GoP). Each of the subproblems is then solved with the
method of Lagrange partial relaxation. Finally, we evaluate the performance of
the proposed method for various system parameters and compare it with schemes
that do not consider $360^o$ video encoding into multiple tiles and quality
layers, as well as with two variants of the proposed method one that considers
layered encoding and SBSs collaboration and another that uses tiles encoding
but with no SBSs collaboration. The results showcase the benefits coming from
caching and delivery decisions on per tile basis and the importance of
exploiting SBSs collaboration.

data mining community, which has been applied to a wide range of real-world
applications and situations. Different from the support-based mining models,
the utility-oriented mining framework integrates the utility theory to provide
more informative and useful patterns. Time-dependent sequence data is commonly
seen in real life. Sequence data has been widely utilized in many applications,
such as analyzing sequential user behavior on the Web, influence maximization,
route planning, and targeted marketing. Unfortunately, all the existing
algorithms lose sight of the fact that the processed data not only contain rich
features (e.g., occur quantity, risk, profit, etc.), but also may be associated
with multi-dimensional auxiliary information, e.g., transaction sequence can be
associated with purchaser profile information. In this paper, we first
formulate the problem of utility mining across multi-dimensional sequences, and
propose a novel framework named MDUS to extract Multi-Dimensional
Utility-oriented Sequential useful patterns. Two algorithms respectively named
MDUS_EM and MDUS_SD are presented to address the formulated problem. The former
algorithm is based on database transformation, and the later one performs
pattern joins and a searching method to identify desired patterns across
multi-dimensional sequences. Extensive experiments are carried on five
real-life datasets and one synthetic dataset to show that the proposed
algorithms can effectively and efficiently discover the useful knowledge from
multi-dimensional sequential databases. Moreover, the MDUS framework can
provide better insight, and it is more adaptable to real-life situations than
the current existing models.

dynamic system or a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Its evolution follows the
Liouville equation. We show that the density function is the dual of the value
function in the optimal control problems. By utilizing the duality, constraints
that are hard to enforce in the primal value function optimization such as
safety constraints in robot navigation, traffic capacity constraints in traffic
flow control can be posed on the density function, and the constrained optimal
control problem can be solved with a primal-dual algorithm that alternates
between the primal and dual optimization. The primal optimization follows the
standard optimal control algorithm with a perturbation term generated by the
density constraint, and the dual problem solves the Liouville equation to get
the density function under a fixed control strategy and updates the
perturbation term. Moreover, the proposed method can be extended to the case
with exogenous disturbance, and guarantee robust safety under the worst-case
disturbance. We apply the proposed method to three examples, a robot navigation
problem and a traffic control problem in sim, and a segway control problem with

useful tool for understanding economic consumer behavior. Traditional
algorithms for mining high-utility patterns (HUPs) applies a single/uniform
minimum high-utility threshold (minutil) to obtain the set of HUPs, but in some
real-life circumstances, some specific products may bring lower utilities
compared with others, but their profit may offer some vital information.
However, if minutil is set high, the patterns with low minutil are missed; if
minutil is set low, the number of patterns becomes unmanageable. In this paper,
an efficient one-phase utility-oriented pattern mining algorithm, called HIMU,
is proposed for mining HUPs with varied item-specific minimum utility. A novel
tree structure called a multiple item utility set-enumeration tree (MIU-tree),
the global sorted and the conditional downward closure properties are
introduced in HIMU. In addition, we extended the compact utility-list structure
to keep the necessary information, and thus this one-phase HIMU model greatly
reduces the computational costs and memory requirements. Moreover, two pruning

experiments in several synthetic and real-world datasets; the results indicates
that the designed one-phase HIMU algorithm can address the ""rare item problem""

  Safety-Critical IoT","19 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.DC cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Calibration plays an important role in ensuring device accuracy within
safety-critical IoT deployments. The process of calibration involves a number
of parties which must collaborate to support calibration. Calibration checks
often precede safety-critical operations such as preparing a robot for surgery,
requiring inter-party interaction to complete checks. At the same time, the
parties involved in a calibration ecosystem may share an adversarial
relationship with a subset of other parties. For instance, a surgical robot
manufacturer may wish to hide the identities of third-parties from the operator
(hospital), in order to maintain confidentiality of business relationships
around its robot products. Thus, information flows that reveal
who-calibrates-for-whom need to be managed to ensure confidentiality.
Similarly, information about what-is-being-calibrated and
how-often-it-is-calibrated may compromise operational confidentiality. For
example, calibration-verification of connected medical devices may reveal the
timing of surgical procedures and compromise PII when combined with other meta
information. We show that the challenge of managing information flows between
the parties involved in calibration cannot be met by any of the classical
access control models, as any one of them or a simple conjunction of a subset
such as the lattice model fails to meet the desired access control
requirements. We demonstrate that a new unified access control model that
combines BIBA, BLP, and Chinese Walls holds rich promise. We study the case for
unification, system properties, and develop an XACML-based authorisation
framework which enforces the unified model. Upon evaluation against a baseline
simple conjunction of the three models individually, our unified model
outperforms this, demonstrating it is capable of solving the novel access

It is natural to study whether such attacks can be used to disrupt swarms of
autonomous vehicles used as part of a large fleet providing taxi and courier
delivery services. In this paper, we start to examine the strategic options
available to attackers and defenders (autonomous-fleet operators) in such

able to carry out crippling denial-of-service attacks on fleets, by leveraging
the inherent deficiencies of road networks identified by techniques from graph
analysis. Experimental results on ten cities using real-world courier traces
shows that most cities will require upgraded infrastructure to defend
driverless vehicles against denial-of-service attacks. We found several hidden

  Networks","12 pages, 15 figures, journal",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Short-term road traffic prediction (STTP) is one of the most important
modules in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, network-level
STTP still remains challenging due to the difficulties both in modeling the
diverse traffic patterns and tacking high-dimensional time series with low
latency. Therefore, a framework combining with a deep clustering (DeepCluster)
module is developed for STTP at largescale networks in this paper. The
DeepCluster module is proposed to supervise the representation learning in a
visualized way from the large unlabeled dataset. More specifically, to fully
exploit the traffic periodicity, the raw series is first split into a number of
sub-series for triplets generation. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with triplet loss are utilized to extract the features of shape by transferring
the series into visual images. The shape-based representations are then used
for road segments clustering. Thereafter, motivated by the fact that the road
segments in a group have similar patterns, a model sharing strategy is further
proposed to build recurrent NNs (RNNs)-based predictions through a group-based
model (GM), instead of individual-based model (IM) in which one model are built
for one road exclusively. Our framework can not only significantly reduce the
number of models and cost, but also increase the number of training data and
the diversity of samples. In the end, we evaluate the proposed framework over
the network of Liuli Bridge in Beijing. Experimental results show that the
DeepCluster can effectively cluster the road segments and GM can achieve
comparable performance against the IM with less number of models.

theoretical analysis is also given, deriving a lower bound on the achievable
uplink spectral efficiency and the mutual information between the input
Gaussian-encoded symbols and the observables available at the communication

planets with masses ranging between super-Earth and Jupiter-type. Additionally,
according to observational constraints, there is a space without planets
between $\sim$0.8~au and $\sim$5.7~au, noting that the inner part of this gap
largely coincides with 55~Cnc's habitable zone --- a sincere motivation for the
search of potentially habitable planets. It has previously been argued that
terrestrial habitable planets are able to exist in the 55~Cnc system, including
a planet at $\sim$1.5~au. We explore this possibility through employing sets of
orbital integrations and assuming an integration time of 50~Myr. We found that
the possibility of Earth-mass planets in the system's habitable zone strongly
depends on the adopted system parameters, notably the eccentricity of 55~Cnc-f,
which is controversial as both a high value ($e \sim 0.32$) and a low value ($e
\sim 0.08$) have previously been deduced. In case that the low value is adopted
(together with other updates for the system parameters), the more plausible and
most recent value, Earth-mass planets would be able to exist in the gap between
1.0~au and 2.0~au, thus implying the possibility of habitable system planets.
Thus, 55~Cnc should be considered a favorable target for future habitable
planet search missions.

carried out in just 0.2 seconds. Inspired by the hummingbirds' near-maximal
performance during such extreme maneuvers, we developed a flight control
strategy and experimentally demonstrated that such maneuverability can be
achieved by an at-scale 12-gram hummingbird robot equipped with just two
actuators. The proposed hybrid control policy combines model-based nonlinear
control with model-free reinforcement learning. We use model-based nonlinear
control for nominal flight control, as the dynamic model is relatively accurate
for these conditions. However, during extreme maneuver, the modeling error
becomes unmanageable. A model-free reinforcement learning policy trained in
simulation was optimized to 'destabilize' the system and maximize the
performance during maneuvering. The hybrid policy manifests a maneuver that is
close to that observed in hummingbirds. Direct simulation-to-real transfer is
achieved, demonstrating the hummingbird-like fast evasive maneuvers on the
at-scale hummingbird robot.

previously there has been a lack of observational evidence to support any of
the theoretical models that might explain the origin of QPPs. We aimed to
determine if there are any relationships between the QPP period and other
properties of the flaring region, using the sample of flares with QPPs from
Pugh et al. (2017b). If any relationships exist then these can be compared with
scaling laws for the theoretical QPP mechanisms. To obtain the flaring region
properties we made use of the AIA 1600 and HMI data. The AIA 1600 images allow
the flare ribbons to be seen while the HMI magnetograms allow the positive and
negative magnetic polarity ribbons to be distinguished and the magnetic
properties determined. The ribbon properties calculated in this study were the
ribbon separation distance, area, total unsigned magnetic flux, and average
magnetic field strength. Only the flares that occurred within \pm 60{\deg} of
the solar disk centre were included, which meant a sample of 20 flares with 22
QPP signals. Positive correlations were found between the QPP period and the
ribbon properties. The strongest correlations were with the separation distance
and magnetic flux. Because these ribbon properties also correlate with the
flare duration, and the relationship between the QPP period and flare duration
may be influenced by observational bias, we also made use of simulated data to
check if artificial correlations could be introduced. These simulations show
that although QPPs cannot be detected for certain combinations of QPP period
and flare duration, this does not introduce an apparent correlation. There is
evidence of relationships between the QPP period and flare ribbon properties,
and in the future the derived scaling laws between these properties can be
compared to equivalent scaling laws for theoretical QPP mechanisms.

established whether this discrepancy can be explained by baryonic feedback or
if it may require modified dark matter models. To better understand the
diversity of dark matter profiles in dwarf galaxies, we undertook a survey of
26 low-mass galaxies ($\log M_*/\textrm{M}_\odot = 8.4-9.8$, $v_{\rm max} =
50-140$ km s$^{-1}$) within 30 Mpc using the Palomar Cosmic Web Imager, which
is among the largest integral field spectroscopic surveys of its type. In this
paper, we derive H$\alpha$ velocity fields for the full sample with a typical
spatial resolution of $\sim$160 pc. We extract rotation curves and verify their
robustness to several choices in the analysis. We present a method for
improving the velocity precision obtained from image slicing spectrographs
using narrowband H$\alpha$ images. For 11 galaxies, we compare the H$\alpha$
velocity fields to CO kinematics measured using CARMA, finding the maps to be
in good agreement. The standard deviation of the difference is typically
$\sim$7 km s$^{-1}$, comparable to the level of turbulence in the interstellar
medium, showing that the two tracers have substantially the same bulk
kinematics. In a companion paper, we will use the rotation curves produced here
to construct mass models of the galaxies and determine their dark matter

years with the success of unsupervised models based on the cycle-consistency

challenging problem of image-to-image translation where the domains are defined
by high-level shapes and contexts, as well as including significant clutter and

intra-domain vector transformations in a latent space learned by a siamese

the generator into generating images in the target domain. To this two-network
system we add a third: a siamese network that guides the generator so that each
original image shares semantics with its generated version. With this new
three-network system, we no longer need to constrain the generators with the
ubiquitous cycle-consistency restraint. As a result, the generators can learn
mappings between more complex domains that differ from each other by large

machinery of global games and variational optimization techniques, we analyze
the revenue implications of such induced externalities in the form of rebates.
We identify optimal profitable designs while unraveling the main drivers of
profit and further elucidate the main practical barriers associated with their
implementation and show how these difficulties can be handled. The key insight
of our rebate design is monetizing the strategic uncertainty in consumers'
beliefs on others' valuations. The common externality induced in consumers'
utilities as a sales-based rebate essentially enables the seller to elicit
different prices at different valuations, given the heterogeneity of the
beliefs on sales volume and hence on the rebate. Our analysis indicates that a
mechanism that creates positive externalities will in fact reduce the profit
because it lowers the expected prices at high valuations. On the other hand,
sellers can use a sales-based rebate mechanism that is decreasing with sales
volume to incentivize purchases at lower valuations by providing higher
expected rebates. Our work contributes to the literature on technology-enabled
features of digitized markets and demonstrates that real-time
sales/subscription data can lead to new revenue management methods.

apparent intent to embed them in our built environment likely to accelerate if
smart city and related programmes succeed. In this paper we are concerned with
the ways in which current generation IoT devices are being designed in terms of
their ill-considered dependencies on network connectivity and services. Our
hope is to provide evidence that such dependencies need to be better thought
through in design, and better documented in implementation so that those
responsible for deploying these devices can be properly informed as to the
impact of device deployment (at scale) on infrastructure resilience. We believe
this will be particularly relevant as we feel that commodity IoT devices are
likely to be commonly used to retrofit `smart' capabilities to existing
buildings, particularly domestic buildings.
  To the existing body of work on network-level behaviour of IoT devices, we
add \one~a protocol-level breakdown and analysis of periodicity, \two~an
exploration of the service and infrastructure dependencies that will implicitly
be taken in `smart' environments when IoT devices are deployed, and
\three~examination of the robustness of device operation when connectivity is
disrupted. We find that many devices make use of services distributed across
the planet and thus appear dependent on the global network infrastructure even
when carrying out purely local actions. Some devices cease to operate properly
without network connectivity (even where their behaviour appears, on the face
of it, to require only local information, e.g.,~the Hive thermostat). Further,
they exhibit quite different network behaviours, typically involving
significantly more traffic and possibly use of otherwise unobserved protocols,
when connectivity is recovered after some disruption.

normal mode oscillations. In this study, the transverse oscillations of the
loops with a few-minutes period and also with damping caused by the resonant
absorption were analyzed using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of the Sun. We
employed the 171 $\AA$ data recorded by Solar Dynamic Observatory
(SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) to analyze the parameters of coronal
loop oscillations such as period, damping time, loop length, and loop width.
For the loop observed on 11 October 2013, the period and the damping of this
loop are obtained to be 19 and 70 minutes, respectively. The damping quality,
the ratio of the damping time to the period, is computed about 3.6. The period
and damping time for the extracted loop recorded on 22 January 2013 are about
81 and 6.79 minutes, respectively. The damping quality is also computed as 12.
It can be concluded that the damping of the transverse oscillations of the
loops is in the strong damping regime, so resonant absorption would be the main
reason for the damping.

these BDMS models, the formation of Pop III stars is significantly suppressed

We then model these effects mathematically. The correctness of these models is
corroborated based on the CSI collected in extensive measurement campaign

contamination in CSI phase and amplitude, we proceed with introducing
pre-processing methods to clean CSI from those errors and make it usable for

to process these data and estimate atmospheric winds by tracking features in

do not come with uncertainty measures. This motivates us to statistically model
wind motions as a spatial process drifting in time. We propose a covariance
function that depends on spatial and temporal lags and a drift parameter to
capture the wind speed and wind direction. We estimate the parameters by local
maximum likelihood. Our method allows us to compute standard errors of the
estimates, enabling spatial smoothing of the estimates using a Gaussian kernel
weighted by the inverses of the estimated variances. We conduct extensive
simulation studies to determine the situations where our method performs well.
The proposed method is applied to the GOES-15 brightness temperature data over
Colorado and reduces prediction error of brightness temperature compared to the

the gamma-ray luminosity in GeV energies and the total infrared luminosity of

$\alpha\simeq 1$. However, the origin of this linear slope is not well
understood. Although extreme starburst galaxies can be regarded as calorimeters
for hadronic cosmic ray interaction and thus a quasi-linear scaling may hold,
it may not be the case for low star-formation-rate (SFR) galaxies, as the
majority of cosmic rays in these galaxies are expected to escape. We calculate
the gamma-ray production efficiency in star-forming galaxies by considering
realistic galaxy properties, such as the gas density and galactic wind velocity
in star-forming galaxies. We find that the slope for the relation between
gamma-ray luminosity and the infrared luminosity gets steeper for low infrared
luminosity galaxies, i.e. $\alpha\rightarrow 1.6$, due to increasingly lower
efficiency for the production of gamma-ray emission. We further find that the
measured data of the gamma-ray luminosity is compatible with such a steepening.
The steepening in the slope suggests that cosmic-ray escape is very important
in low-SFR galaxies.

this paper, we present Gaussian Proposal Networks (GPNs), a novel extension to

ellipses as 2D Gaussian distributions on the image plain and minimizes the

significantly outperforms RPN for lesion bounding ellipse detection thanks to
lower localization error. GPN is open sourced at

much research in identifying potentially offensive messages. However, previous
work on this topic did not consider the problem as a whole, but rather focused
on detecting very specific types of offensive content, e.g., hate speech,
cyberbulling, or cyber-aggression. In contrast, here we target several
different kinds of offensive content. In particular, we model the task
hierarchically, identifying the type and the target of offensive messages in
social media. For this purpose, we complied the Offensive Language
Identification Dataset (OLID), a new dataset with tweets annotated for
offensive content using a fine-grained three-layer annotation scheme, which we
make publicly available. We discuss the main similarities and differences
between OLID and pre-existing datasets for hate speech identification,
aggression detection, and similar tasks. We further experiment with and we
compare the performance of different machine learning models on OLID.

critical for many applications. While focused crawling strategies have been
shown to be effective for discovery, configuring a focused crawler is difficult

(SMEs) must search for relevant websites and collect a set of representative
Web pages to serve as training examples for creating a classifier that
recognizes pages in $D$, as well as a set of pages to seed the crawl. In this
paper, we propose DISCO, an approach designed to bootstrap domain-specific
search. Given a small set of websites, DISCO aims to discover a large
collection of relevant websites. DISCO uses a ranking-based framework that
mimics the way users search for information on the Web: it iteratively
discovers new pages, distills, and ranks them. It also applies multiple
discovery strategies, including keyword-based and related queries issued to
search engines, backward and forward crawling. By systematically combining
these strategies, DISCO is able to attain high harvest rates and coverage for a
variety of domains. We perform extensive experiments in four social-good
domains, using data gathered by SMEs in the respective domains, and show that
our approach is effective and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  regularity and compactness","58 pages, 5 Figures. Theorem 9.1 added. Minor corrections",,,,"math.DG math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a previous paper we developed a regularity and compactness theory in
Euclidean ambient spaces for codimension 1 weakly stable CMC integral varifolds
satisfying two (necessary) structural conditions. Here we generalize this
theory to the setting where the mean curvature (of the regular part of the
varifold) is prescribed by a given $C^{1, \alpha}$ ambient function $g$ and the
ambient space is a general $(n+1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold; we give
general conditions that imply that the support of the varifold, away from a
possible singular set of dimension $\leq n-7,$ is the image of a $C^{2}$
immersion with continuous unit normal $\nu$ and mean curvature $g\nu$. These
conditions also identify a compact class of varifolds subject to an additional
uniform mass bound.
  If $g$ does not vanish anywhere, or more generally if the set $\{g=0\}$ is
sufficiently small (e.g. if ${\mathcal H}^{n}\,(\{g=0\})=0$), then the results
and their proofs are quite analogous to the CMC case. When $g$ is arbitrary
however, a number of additional considerations must be taken into account:
first, the correct second variation assumption is that of finite Morse index
(rather than weak stability); secondly, to have a geometrically useful theory
with compactness conclusions, one of the two structural conditions on the
varifold must be weakened; thirdly, in view of easy examples, this weakening of
a structural hypothesis necessitates additional hypotheses in order to reach
the same conclusion. We identify two sets of additional assumptions under which
this conclusion holds for general $g$: one of them gives regularity and
compactness, the other one gives regularity and is applicable to certain phase
transition problems. We also provide corollaries for multiplicity $1$ varifolds
associated to reduced boundaries of Caccioppoli sets. In these cases, some or
all of the structural assumptions become redundant.

however, field lines from the spacecraft mapped to another, negative-polarity
equatorial coronal hole. Following the encounter, Parker was magnetically
connected to the large, positive-polarity northern polar coronal hole. When the
Parker data become available, these model results can be used to assist in
their calibration and interpretation, and, additionally, provide a global
context for interpreting the localized {\it in situ} measurements. In
particular, we can identify what types of solar wind Parker encountered, what
the underlying magnetic structure was, and how complexities in the orbital
trajectory can be interpreted within a global, inertial frame. Ultimately, the
measurements returned by Parker can be used to constrain current theories for
heating the solar corona and accelerating the solar wind.

requires costly and time-consuming manual chart reviews resulting in poor
participation. To help automate the process, National NLP Clinical Challenges
(N2C2) conducted a shared challenge by defining 13 criteria for clinical trial
cohort selection and by providing training and test datasets. This research was
motivated by the N2C2 challenge.
  Methods: We broke down the task into 13 independent subtasks corresponding to
each criterion and implemented subtasks using rules or a supervised machine
learning model. Each task critically depended on knowledge resources in the
form of task-specific lexicons, for which we developed a novel model-driven
approach. The approach allowed us to first expand the lexicon from a seed set
and then remove noise from the list, thus improving the accuracy.
  Results: Our system achieved an overall F measure of 0.9003 at the challenge,
and was statistically tied for the first place out of 45 participants. The
model-driven lexicon development and further debugging the rules/code on the
training set improved overall F measure to 0.9140, overtaking the best
numerical result at the challenge.
  Discussion: Cohort selection, like phenotype extraction and classification,
is amenable to rule-based or simple machine learning methods, however, the
lexicons involved, such as medication names or medical terms referring to a
medical problem, critically determine the overall accuracy. Automated lexicon
development has the potential for scalability and accuracy.

properly choosing the freedom introduced in the method, the errors can be
minimized, which significantly improves the accuracy of the calculations. A
byproduct of the method is to provide a very clear explanation of the Langer

$B_{\text{dip},\text{HAT-P-7b}} \gtrsim 6 \, \mathrm{G} $, a result that is
consistent with three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations and lies
below typical surface dipole estimates of inflated HJs. The same analysis
suggests the minimum dipole field strength required to reverse the winds of
CoRoT-2b is $B_{\text{dip},\text{CoRoT-2b}} \gtrsim 3 \, \mathrm{kG}$, which
considerably exceeds estimates of the maximum surface dipole strength for HJs.
We hence conclude that our magnetic wave-driven mechanism provides an
explanation for wind reversals on HAT-P-7b; however, other physical phenomena
provide more plausible explanations for wind reversals on CoRoT-2b.

criterion. A common practice for dealing with missing values in the context of
clustering is to first impute the missing values, and then apply the clustering
algorithm on the completed data.
  We consider missing values in the context of optimal clustering, which finds
an optimal clustering operator with reference to an underlying random labeled
point process (RLPP). We show how the missing-value problem fits neatly into
the overall framework of optimal clustering by incorporating the missing value
mechanism into the random labeled point process and then marginalizing out the
missing-value process. In particular, we demonstrate the proposed framework for
the Gaussian model with arbitrary covariance structures. Comprehensive
experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world RNA-seq data show the
superior performance of the proposed optimal clustering with missing values
when compared to various clustering approaches. Optimal clustering with missing
values obviates the need for imputation-based pre-processing of the data, while
at the same time possessing smaller clustering errors.

with the uncertain demand and real-time dynamics of network resource requests.
Another challenge is the combinatorial optimization of numerous resources,
e.g., radio, computing, and storage. This article develops an optimal and fast
real-time resource slicing framework that maximizes the long-term return of the
network provider while taking into account the uncertainty of resource demand
from tenants. Specifically, we first propose a novel system model which enables
the network provider to effectively slice various types of resources to
different classes of users under separate virtual slices. We then capture the
real-time arrival of slice requests by a semi-Markov decision process. To
obtain the optimal resource allocation policy under the dynamics of slicing
requests, e.g., uncertain service time and resource demands, a Q-learning
algorithm is often adopted in the literature. However, such an algorithm is
notorious for its slow convergence, especially for problems with large
state/action spaces. This makes Q-learning practically inapplicable to our case
in which multiple resources are simultaneously optimized. To tackle it, we
propose a novel network slicing approach with an advanced deep learning
architecture, called deep dueling that attains the optimal average reward much
faster than the conventional Q-learning algorithm. This property is especially
desirable to cope with real-time resource requests and the dynamic demands of
users. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework yields up to 40%
higher long-term average return while being few thousand times faster, compared
with state of the art network slicing approaches.

algorithms have been utilized to generate hard instances. However, they
generate only finite number of hard instances. The merit of such methods is
limited because it is difficult to extract meaningful patterns from small
number of instances. We seek for a probabilistic generator of hard instances.
Once the generative distribution of hard instances is obtained, we can sample a
variety of hard instances to build a benchmark, and we can extract meaningful
patterns of hard instances from sampled instances. The existing methods for
modeling the hard instance distribution rely on parameters or rules that are
found by domain experts; however, they are specific to the problem. Hence, it

preserves the global structure at the expense of discarding local details?
There has been extensive work on both graph sparsification (removing edges) and
graph coarsening (merging nodes, often by edge contraction); however, these
operations are currently treated separately. Interestingly, for a planar graph,
edge deletion corresponds to edge contraction in its planar dual (and more
generally, for a graphical matroid and its dual). Moreover, with respect to the
dynamics induced by the graph Laplacian (e.g., diffusion), deletion and
contraction are physical manifestations of two reciprocal limits: edge weights
of $0$ and $\infty$, respectively. In this work, we provide a unifying
framework that captures both of these operations, allowing one to
simultaneously sparsify and coarsen a graph while preserving its large-scale
structure. The limit of infinite edge weight is rarely considered, as many
classical notions of graph similarity diverge. However, its algebraic,
geometric, and physical interpretations are reflected in the Laplacian
pseudoinverse $\mathbf{\mathit{L}}^{\dagger}$, which remains finite in this
limit. Motivated by this insight, we provide a probabilistic algorithm that
reduces graphs while preserving $\mathbf{\mathit{L}}^{\dagger}$, using an
unbiased procedure that minimizes its variance. We compare our algorithm with
several existing sparsification and coarsening algorithms using real-world

sources has different health implications. In particular, recent evidence
suggests that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with chemical tracers suggesting
coal combustion origins is especially harmful. Augmenting this knowledge with
estimates from causal inference methods to identify the health impacts of PM2.5
derived from specific point sources of coal combustion would be an important
step towards informing specific, targeted interventions. We investigated the
effect of high-exposure to coal combustion emissions from 783 coal-fired power
generating units on ischemic heart disease (IHD) hospitalizations in over 19
million Medicare beneficiaries residing at 21,351 ZIP codes in the eastern
United States. We used InMAP, a newly-developed, reduced-complexity air quality
model to classify each ZIP code as either a high-exposed or control location.
Our health outcomes analysis uses a causal inference method - propensity score
matching - to adjust for potential confounders of the relationship between
exposure and IHD. We fit separate Poisson regression models to the matched data
in each geographic region to estimate the incidence rate ratio for IHD
comparing high-exposed to control locations. High exposure to coal power plant
emissions and IHD were positively associated in the Northeast (IRR = 1.08, 95%
CI = 1.06, 1.09) and the Southeast (IRR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.08). No
significant association was found in the Industrial Midwest (IRR = 1.02, 95% CI
= 1.00, 1.04), likely the result of small exposure contrasts between
high-exposed and control ZIP codes in that region. This study provides targeted
evidence of the association between emissions from specific coal power plants
and IHD hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries.

the quality of community structures through controlling (1) the number of

clauses, and (2) the number of variables that only belong to one community,
which we call intra-community variables. To study the combined effect of
community structures and clause distributions on the hardness of SAT formulas,
we measure solving runtimes of two solvers, gluHack (a leading CDCL solver) and
CPSparrow (a leading SLS solver), on the generated SAT formulas under different
groups of parameter settings. Through extensive experiments, we obtain some
noteworthy observations on the SAT formulas generated by the proposed
algorithm: (1) The community structure has little or no effects on the hardness
of SAT formulas with regard to CPSparrow but a strong effect with regard to
gluHack. (2) Only when the proportion of true literals in a SAT formula in
terms of the predefined solution is 0.5, SAT formulas are hard-to-solve with

hard-to-solve with regard to CPSparrow. (3) When the ratio of the number of

enhance the quality of compressed image/video. The existing approaches mainly
focus on enhancing the quality of a single frame, not considering the
similarity between consecutive frames. Since heavy fluctuation exists across
compressed video frames as investigated in this paper, frame similarity can be
utilized for quality enhancement of low-quality frames given their neighboring
high-quality frames. This task is Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement (MFQE).
Accordingly, this paper proposes an MFQE approach for compressed video, as the
first attempt in this direction. In our approach, we firstly develop a
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) based detector to locate Peak
Quality Frames (PQFs) in compressed video. Then, a novel Multi-Frame
Convolutional Neural Network (MF-CNN) is designed to enhance the quality of
compressed video, in which the non-PQF and its nearest two PQFs are the input.
In MF-CNN, motion between the non-PQF and PQFs is compensated by a motion
compensation subnet. Subsequently, a quality enhancement subnet fuses the
non-PQF and compensated PQFs, and then reduces the compression artifacts of the
non-PQF. Also, PQF quality is enhanced in the same way. Finally, experiments
validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our MFQE approach in
advancing the state-of-the-art quality enhancement of compressed video. The

SPIM-mmWave guarantees to outperform conventional mmWave-MIMO systems.

dirty data records are incompatible with a user's domain knowledge. Previous
approaches allow the user to specify domain knowledge in the form of logical
constraints (e.g., functional dependency and denial constraints). We extend the
constraint-based approach by introducing a novel class of statistical
constraints (SCs). An SC treats each column as a random variable, and enforces
an independence or dependence relationship between two (or a few) random
variables. Statistical constraints are expressive, allowing the user to specify
a wide range of domain knowledge, beyond traditional integrity constraints.
Furthermore, they work harmoniously with downstream statistical modeling. We
develop CODED, an SC-Oriented Data Error Detection system that supports three
key tasks: (1) Checking whether an SC is violated or not on a given dataset,
(2) Identify the top-k records that contribute the most to the violation of an
SC, and (3) Checking whether a set of input SCs have conflicts or not. We
present effective solutions for each task. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data illustrate how SCs apply to error detection, and provide
evidence that CODED performs better than state-of-the-art approaches.

$2.32\pm0.83$~g\,cm$^{-3}$, both Kepler-411c and Kepler-411d belong to the

classification (e.g. ImageNet), but it is necessary to move beyond the
single-label classification task because pictures of everyday life are
inherently multi-label. Multi-label classification is a more difficult task
than single-label classification because both the input images and output label
spaces are more complex. Furthermore, collecting clean multi-label annotations
is more difficult to scale-up than single-label annotations. To reduce the
annotation cost, we propose to train a model with partial labels i.e. only some
labels are known per image. We first empirically compare different labeling
strategies to show the potential for using partial labels on multi-label
datasets. Then to learn with partial labels, we introduce a new classification
loss that exploits the proportion of known labels per example. Our approach
allows the use of the same training settings as when learning with all the
annotations. We further explore several curriculum learning based strategies to
predict missing labels. Experiments are performed on three large-scale

More specifically, in order to apply Bayesian optimization to structured data,
we extract useful topological information from a structure and measure the
proper similarity between structures. To this end, we utilize persistent
homology, which is a topological data analysis method that was recently applied
in machine learning. Moreover, we propose the Bayesian optimization algorithm
that can handle multiple types of topological information by using a linear
combination of kernels for persistence diagrams. Through experiments, we show
that topological information extracted by persistent homology contributes to a
more efficient search for optimal structures compared to the random search

to consider the classical mechanics as a hidden variable quantum system. Then
the Planck scale modification of this quantum system naturally induces the

high cost of mutation analysis after the observation of failures, which may
present a challenge for its practical adoption. We introduce SIMFL (Statistical
Inference for Mutation-based Fault Localisation), an MBFL technique that allows
users to perform the mutation analysis in advance before a failure is observed,
allowing the amortisation of the analysis cost. SIMFL uses mutants as
artificial faults and aims to learn the failure patterns among test cases
against different locations of mutations. Once a failure is observed, SIMFL
requires either almost no or very small additional cost for analysis, depending
on the used inference model. An empirical evaluation using Defects4J shows that
SIMFL can successfully localise up to 113 out of 203 studied faults (55%) at
the top, and 159 (78%) faults within the top five, significantly outperforming
existing MBFL techniques while using the results of mutation analysis that has
been undertaken before the test failure. The amortised cost of mutation
analysis can be further reduced by mutation sampling: SIMFL retains 80% of its
localisation accuracy at the top rank when using only 10% of generated mutants,
compared to results obtained without sampling.

well-posedness of some linear transmission problems, which then is combined
with a fixed point theorem in order to show the well-posedness of the nonlinear
transmission problem for the anisotropic Stokes and Navier-Stokes systems in
$L_p$-based weighted Sobolev spaces, whenever the given data are small enough.

magnetization in a ferromagnetic material, is taken into consideration. This
highly nonlinear equation, with a non-convex constraint, has several equivalent
forms, and involves solving an auxiliary problem in the infinite domain. All
these features have posed interesting challenges in developing numerical
methods. In this paper, we first present a fully discrete semi-implicit method
for solving the Landau-Lifshitz equation based on the second-order backward
differentiation formula and the one-sided extrapolation (using previous
time-step numerical values). A projection step is further used to preserve the
length of the magnetization. Subsequently, we provide a rigorous convergence
analysis for the fully discrete numerical solution, with second-order accuracy
in both time and space, provided that the spatial step-size is the same order
as the temporal step-size. And also, the unique solvability of the numerical
solution is theoretically justified, which turns out to be the first such
result for the micromagnetics model. All these theoretical properties are
verified by numerical examples in both one- and three- dimensional spaces.

linear system, where the Koopman operator advances observations of the state
forward in time. However, the observable functions that map states to
observations are generally unknown. We introduce the Deep Variational Koopman
(DVK) model, a method for inferring distributions over observations that can be
propagated linearly in time. By sampling from the inferred distributions, we
obtain a distribution over dynamical models, which in turn provides a
distribution over possible outcomes as a modeled system advances in time.
Experiments show that the DVK model is effective at long-term prediction for a
variety of dynamical systems. Furthermore, we describe how to incorporate the
learned models into a control framework, and demonstrate that accounting for
the uncertainty present in the distribution over dynamical models enables more
effective control.

dynamically operating a transit service in an area of crowd movements. The
proposed framework integrates demand prediction and supply optimization to
periodically redesign the service routes based on recently observed demand. To
predict demand for the service, we use Quantile Regression to estimate the
marginal distribution of movement counts between each pair of serviced
locations. The framework then combines these marginals into a joint demand
distribution by constructing a Gaussian copula, which captures the structure of
correlation between the marginals. For supply optimization, we devise a linear
programming model, which simultaneously determines the route structure and the
service frequency according to the predicted demand. Importantly, our framework
both preserves the uncertainty structure of future demand and leverages this
for robust route optimization, while keeping both components decoupled. We
evaluate our framework using a real-world case study of autonomous mobility in
a university campus in Denmark. The results show that our framework often
obtains the ground truth optimal solution, and can outperform conventional
methods for route optimization, which do not leverage full predictive
distributions.

fetal heart rate (fHR). We sought to validate the presence of such PS signature
in fHR by measuring coupling between maternal HR (mHR) and fHR. Study design:
Prospective observational cohort study in stressed group (SG) mothers with
controls matched for gestational age during screening at third trimester using
Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire with PSS-10 equal or above 19
classified as SG. Women with PSS-10 less than 19 served as control group (CG).
Setting: Klinikum rechts der Isar of the Technical University of Munich.
Population: Singleton 3rd trimester pregnant women. Methods: Transabdominal
fetal electrocardiograms (fECG) were recorded. We deployed a signal processing
algorithm termed bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging (BPRSA) to quantify
coupling between mHR and fHR resulting in a fetal stress index (FSI). Maternal
hair cortisol was measured at birth. Differences were assumed to be significant
for p value less than 0.05. Main Outcome Measures: Differences for FSI between
both groups. Results: We screened 1500 women enrolling 538 of which 16.5 %
showed a PSS-10 score equal or above 19 at 34+0 weeks. Fifty five women
eventually comprised the SG and n=55 served as CG. Median PSS was 22.0 (IQR
21.0-24.0) in the SG and 9.0 (6.0-12.0) in the CG, respectively. Maternal hair
cortisol was higher in SG than CG at 86.6 (48.0-169.2) versus 53.0 (34.4-105.9)
pg/mg. At 36+5 weeks, FSI was significantly higher in fetuses of stressed
mothers when compared to controls [0.43 (0.18-0.85) versus 0.00 (-0.49-0.18)].
Conclusion: Our findings show a persistent effect of PS affecting fetuses in
the last trimester.

effectively modeling of feature interactions. Despite the successful
application of FM and its many deep learning variants, treating every feature
interaction fairly may degrade the performance. For example, the interactions
of a useless feature may introduce noises; the importance of a feature may also
differ when interacting with different features. In this work, we propose a
novel model named \emph{Interaction-aware Factorization Machine} (IFM) by
introducing Interaction-Aware Mechanism (IAM), which comprises the
\emph{feature aspect} and the \emph{field aspect}, to learn flexible
interactions on two levels. The feature aspect learns feature interaction
importance via an attention network while the field aspect learns the feature
interaction effect as a parametric similarity of the feature interaction vector
and the corresponding field interaction prototype. IFM introduces more
structured control and learns feature interaction importance in a stratified
manner, which allows for more leverage in tweaking the interactions on both
feature-wise and field-wise levels. Besides, we give a more generalized
architecture and propose Interaction-aware Neural Network (INN) and DeepIFM to
capture higher-order interactions. To further improve both the performance and
efficiency of IFM, a sampling scheme is developed to select interactions based
on the field aspect importance. The experimental results from two well-known
datasets show the superiority of the proposed models over the state-of-the-art
methods.

the interior mode which is distinct from the originally entangled qubit in the

influence the experience of the infalling observer since description of the

segmenting bird vocalizations. The framework utilizes a binary classification
model to categorize frames of an input audio recording into the background or
bird vocalization. The first pass of the framework automatically generates
training labels from the input recording itself, while model training and
classification is done during the second pass. The proposed framework utilizes
a reference directional model for obtaining a feature representation called
directional embeddings (DE). This reference directional model acts as an
acoustic model for bird vocalizations and is obtained using the mixtures of
Von-Mises Fisher distribution (moVMF). The proposed DE space only contains
information about bird vocalizations, while no information about the background
disturbances is reflected. The framework employs supervised information only
for obtaining the reference directional model and avoids the background
modeling. Hence, it can be regarded as semi-supervised in nature. The proposed
framework is tested on approximately 79000 vocalizations of seven different
bird species. The performance of the framework is also analyzed in the presence
of noise at different SNRs. Experimental results convey that the proposed
framework performs better than the existing bird vocalization segmentation
methods.

large database $DB$ of size $n$, and a client holds an index $i \in [n]$ and
wishes to retrieve $DB[i]$ without revealing $i$ to the server. It is well
known that information theoretic privacy even against an `honest but curious'
server requires $\Omega(n)$ communication complexity. This is true even if
quantum communication is allowed and is due to the ability of such an
adversarial server to execute the protocol on a superposition of databases
instead of on a specific database (`input purification attack'). Nevertheless,
there have been some proposals of protocols that achieve sub-linear
communication and appear to provide some notion of privacy. Most notably, a
protocol due to Le Gall (ToC 2012) with communication complexity $O(\sqrt{n})$,
and a protocol by Kerenidis et al. (QIC 2016) with communication complexity
$O(\log(n))$, and $O(n)$ shared entanglement.
  We show that, in a sense, input purification is the only potent adversarial
strategy, and protocols such as the two protocols above are secure in a
restricted variant of the quantum honest but curious (a.k.a specious) model.
More explicitly, we propose a restricted privacy notion called \emph{anchored
privacy}, where the adversary is forced to execute on a classical database
(i.e. the execution is anchored to a classical database). We show that for
measurement-free protocols, anchored security against honest adversarial
servers implies anchored privacy even against specious adversaries.
  Finally, we prove that even with (unlimited) pre-shared entanglement it is
impossible to achieve security in the standard specious model with sub-linear
communication, thus further substantiating the necessity of our relaxation.
This lower bound may be of independent interest (in particular recalling that
PIR is a special case of Fully Homomorphic Encryption).

universe has been subject to debate. We consider in an elementary way the
Newtonian limit of the Einstein equations with this ansatz for the case of
structure formation in late-time cosmology, on small and large scales, and
argue that linearizing the Einstein tensor produces only a small error down to
arbitrarily small, decoupled scales (e.g. Solar system scales). On subhorizon
patches, the metric scale factor becomes a coordinate choice equivalent to
choosing the spatial curvature, and not a sign that the FLRW metric cannot
perturbatively accommodate very different local physical expansion rates of
matter; we distinguish these concepts, and show that they merge on large scales
for the Newtonian limit to be globally valid. Furthermore, on subhorizon
scales, a perturbed FLRW metric ansatz does not already imply assumptions on
isotropy, and effects beyond an FLRW background, including those potentially
caused by non-linearities of general relativity (GR), may be encoded into
non-trivial boundary conditions. The corresponding cosmologies have already
been developed in a Newtonian setting by Heckmann and Sch\""ucking and none of
these boundary conditions can explain the accelerated expansion of the
universe. Our analysis of the field equations is confirmed on the level of
solutions by an example of pedagogical value, comparing a collapsing top-hat
overdensity (embedded into a cosmological background) treated in such
perturbative manner to the corresponding exact solution of GR, where we find
good agreement even in the regimes of strong density contrast.

segment plane instances and recover 3D plane parameters from an image. Most
recent approaches leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and achieve
promising results. However, these methods are limited to detecting a fixed
number of planes with certain learned order. To tackle this problem, we propose
a novel two-stage method based on associative embedding, inspired by its recent
success in instance segmentation. In the first stage, we train a CNN to map
each pixel to an embedding space where pixels from the same plane instance have
similar embeddings. Then, the plane instances are obtained by grouping the
embedding vectors in planar regions via an efficient mean shift clustering
algorithm. In the second stage, we estimate the parameter for each plane
instance by considering both pixel-level and instance-level consistencies. With
the proposed method, we are able to detect an arbitrary number of planes.
Extensive experiments on public datasets validate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our method. Furthermore, our method runs at 30 fps at the testing
time, thus could facilitate many real-time applications such as visual SLAM and

are non-convex and hence difficult to solve globally. To deal with them, we

issue in neural dependency parsing. We investigate the impact of adding a tree
layer on top of a sequential model by recursively composing subtree
representations (composition) in a transition-based parser that uses features
extracted by a BiLSTM. Composition seems superfluous with such a model,
suggesting that BiLSTMs capture information about subtrees. We perform model
ablations to tease out the conditions under which composition helps. When
ablating the backward LSTM, performance drops and composition does not recover
much of the gap. When ablating the forward LSTM, performance drops less
dramatically and composition recovers a substantial part of the gap, indicating
that a forward LSTM and composition capture similar information. We take the
backward LSTM to be related to lookahead features and the forward LSTM to the
rich history-based features both crucial for transition-based parsers. To
capture history-based information, composition is better than a forward LSTM on
its own, but it is even better to have a forward LSTM as part of a BiLSTM. We
correlate results with language properties, showing that the improved lookahead
of a backward LSTM is especially important for head-final languages.

assumption that facial occlusion is partial and incomplete, multiple patch
occluded images are fed as inputs for knowledge boosting, such as identity and
texture information. A new aggregation structure composed of a deep GAN for
coarse face synthesis and a shallow boosting net for fine face generation is

to length l, the frequency fis inversely proportional to l. The slope m of f

provide 3D information of hands and promote 3D hand pose estimation. There are
nevertheless limitations on the dataset size, global viewpoints, hand
articulations and hand shapes in the publicly available stereo-based hand pose
datasets. To mitigate these limitations and promote further research on hand
pose estimation from stereo images, we propose a new large-scale binocular hand
pose dataset called THU-Bi-Hand, offering a new perspective for fingertip
localization. In the THU-Bi-Hand dataset, there are 447k pairs of stereo images
of different hand shapes from 10 subjects with accurate 3D location annotations
of the wrist and five fingertips. Captured with minimal restriction on the
range of hand motion, the dataset covers large global viewpoint space and hand
articulation space. To better present the performance of fingertip localization
on THU-Bi-Hand, we propose a novel scheme termed Bi-stream Pose Guided Region
Ensemble Network (Bi-Pose-REN). It extracts more representative feature regions
around joint points in the feature maps under the guidance of the previously
estimated pose. The feature regions are integrated hierarchically according to
the topology of hand joints to regress the refined hand pose. Bi-Pose-REN and
several existing methods are evaluated on THU-Bi-Hand so that benchmarks are
provided for further research. Experimental results show that our new method
has achieved the best performance on THU-Bi-Hand.

In particular, the post-Newtonian approximation describes with high accuracy
the early inspiral of compact binary systems, made of black holes or neutron
stars. It mainly consists of extending the Einstein quadrupole formula by a
series of relativistic corrections up to high order. The compact objects are
modelled by point masses with spins. The practical calculations face difficult
problems of divergences, which have been solved thanks to the dimensional
regularization. In the last rotations before the merger, the finite size

typical open clusters in the Solar neighbourhood containing hundreds or
thousands of member stars, ten to twenty per cent of Solar-mass member stars
are expected to encounter another star at distances closer than 100 au. These
close encounters strongly perturb the planetary systems, directly causing
ejection of planets or their capture by the intruding star, as well as exciting
the orbits. Using extensive $N$-body simulations, we study such fly-by
encounters between two Solar System analogues, each with four giant planets
from Jupiter to Neptune. We quantify the rates of loss and capture immediately
after the encounter, e.g., the Neptune analogue is lost in one in four
encounters within 100 au, and captured by the flying-by star in one in twelve
encounters. We then perform long-term (up to 1 Gyr) simulations investigating
the ensuing post-encounter evolution. We show that large numbers of planets are
removed from systems due to planet--planet interactions and that captured
planets further enhance the system instability. While encounters can initially
leave a planetary system containing more planets by inserting additional ones,
the long-term instability causes a net reduction in planet number. A captured
planet ends up on a retrograde orbit in half of the runs in which it survives
for 1 Gyr; also, a planet bound to its original host star but flipped during
the encounter may survive. Thus, encounters between planetary systems are a
channel to create counter-rotating planets, This would happen in around 1% of
systems, and such planets are potentially detectable through astrometry or
direct imaging.

Moreover, we verify that RC can perform cost-adjustable inference which is
achieved by varying its unrolling steps. We learn double independent BN layers

This work proposes to tackle this challenge through domain adaptation, a

application of a Domain-Adversarial Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) to
multi-modal time series driving data is presented, in which domain-invariant

been carried out in fluoride containing electrolyte under bipolar pulse current
regime. Unusual PEO cathodic micro-discharges have been observed and
investigated. It is shown that the cathodic micro-discharges exhibit a
collective intermittent behavior which is discussed in terms of charge
accumulations at the layer/electrolyte and layer/metal interfaces. Optical
emission spectroscopy is used to determine the electron density (typ. 10 15
cm-3) and the electron temperature (typ. 7500 K) while the role of F-anions on
the appearance of cathodic micro-discharges is pointed out. Plasma Electrolytic
Oxidation (PEO) is a promising plasma-assisted surface treatment of light
metallic alloys (e.g. Al, Mg, Ti). Although the PEO process makes it possible
to grow oxide coatings with interesting corrosion and wear resistant
properties, the physical mechanisms of coating growth are not yet completely
understood. Typically, the process consists in applying a high voltage
difference between a metallic piece and a counter-electrode which are both
immersed in an electrolyte bath. Compare to anodizing, the main differences
concern the electrolyte composition and the current and voltage ranges which
are at least one order of magnitude higher in PEO 1. These significant
differences in current and voltage imply the dielectric breakdown and
consequently the appearance of micro-discharges on the surface of the sample
under processing. Those micro-discharges are recognized as being the main
contributors to the formation of a dielectric porous crystalline oxide coating.
2 Nevertheless, the breakdown mechanism that governs the appearance of those
micro-discharges is still under investigation. Hussein et al. 3 proposed a
mechanism with three different plasma formation processes based on differences
in plasma chemical composition. The results of Jovovi{\'c} et al. 4,5
concerning physical properties of the plasma seem to corroborate this
mechanism, and also point out the importance of the substrate material in the
plasma composition. 6 Compared with DC conducted PEO process, using a bipolar
pulsed DC or AC current supply gives supplementary control latitude through the
current waveform parameters. The effect of these parameter on the
micro-discharges behavior has been investigated in several previous works.
2,3,7,8 One of the main results of these studies is the absence of
micro-discharge during the cathodic current half-period. 9-11 Even if the
cathodic half-period has an obvious effect on the efficiency of PEO as well as
on the coating growth and composition, the micro-plasmas appear only in anodic
half-period. Sah et al. 8 have observed the cathodic breakdown of an oxide
layer but at very high current density (10 kA.dm-${}^2$), and after several
steps of sample preparation. Several models of micro-discharges appearance in
AC current have already been proposed. 1,2,8,12,13 Though cathodic
micro-discharges have never been observed within usual process conditions, the
present study aims at defining suitable conditions to promote cathodic
micro-discharges and at studying the main characteristics of these
micro-plasmas.

nonlinear systems with linear time-invariant input vector field components.
First, we define differential reachability and observability Gramians. They are
matrix valued functions of the state trajectory (i.e. the initial state and
input trajectory) of the original nonlinear system, and it is difficult to find
them as functions of the initial state and input. The main result of this paper
is to show that for a fixed state trajectory, it is possible to compute the
values of these Gramians by using impulse and initial state responses of the
variational system. Therefore, balanced truncation is doable along the fixed
state trajectory without solving nonlinear partial differential equations,
differently from conventional nonlinear balancing methods. We further develop
an approximation method, which only requires trajectories of the original
nonlinear systems. Our methods are demonstrated by an RL network along a
trajectory.

weight $\omega$ on the unit disc is a bounded operator from one space into
another is of primordial importance in the theory of Bergman spaces. The
long-standing problem of describing the radial weights $\omega$ such that
$P_\omega$ is bounded on the Lebesgue space $L^p_\omega$ had been known to
experts since decades before it was formally posed by Dostani\'c in 2004. A
natural limit case of this setting is when $P_\omega$ acts from $L^\infty$ to
the Bloch space. The surjectivity of the operator becomes another relevant
question in this limit case.
  The main findings of this study are shortly listed as follows. We establish
characterizations of the radial weights $\omega$ on the unit disc such that
$P_\omega:L^\infty\to\mathcal{B}$ is bounded and/or acts surjectively, or the
dual of $A^1_\omega$ is isomorphic to the Bloch space $\mathcal{B}$ under the
$A^2_\omega$-pairing. We also solve the problem posed by Dostani\'c under a
weak regularity hypothesis on the weight involved. With regard to
Littlewood-Paley estimates, we describe the radial weights $\omega$ such that
the norm of any function in $A^p_\omega$ is comparable to the norm in
$L^p_\omega$ of its derivative times the distance from the boundary. This
last-mentioned result solves another well-known problem on the area. All
characterizations can be given in terms of doubling conditions on moments
and/or tail integrals $\int_r^1\omega(t)\,dt$ of $\omega$, and are therefore
easy to interpret.
  We also make substantial progress about the two weight inequality
  $$
  \|P_\omega(f)\|_{L^p_\nu}\le C\|f\|_{L^p_\nu},\quad f\in L^p_\nu, \quad
1<p<\infty.
  $$ for radial weights $\omega$ and $\nu$.

efficiency, and can be largely influenced by laser frequency fluctuation. In
this work, we carried out a systematic study of the effect of laser frequency
fluctuation on the decoherence rate. We derived an analytical formula that
quantitatively describes the relationship between the decoherence rate and
laser frequency fluctuation. The formula was experimentally verified by using
the $\Lambda$-type EIT system of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms, in which one can
either completely eliminate or controllably introduce the effect of laser

applications. First we demonstrate how the correction terms can be configured
to endow the reconstructed models with screening mechanisms such as the

existence of classes of Horndeski models that are degenerate with standard
cosmology to an arbitrary level in the cosmological perturbations. Particularly
interesting examples are kinetically self-accelerating models that mimic the
dynamics of the cosmological constant to an arbitrary degree in perturbations.
Finally, we develop the reconstruction method further to the level of
higher-order effective field theory, which under the restriction to a luminal
propagation speed of gravitational waves introduces two new free functions per
order. These functions determine the corresponding correction terms in the

We aim at automatically classifying the newly observed stars, with near

this paper, we present a classification algorithm built to recognise solar-like
pulsators among classical pulsators, which relies on the global amount of power
contained in the PSD, also known as the FliPer (Flicker in spectral Power
density). As each type of pulsating star has a characteristic background or
pulsation pattern, the shape of the PSD at different frequencies can be used to
characterise the type of pulsating star. The FliPer Classifier
(FliPer$_{Class}$) uses different FliPer parameters along with the effective
temperature as input parameters to feed a machine learning algorithm in order
to automatically classify the pulsating stars observed by TESS. Using noisy
TESS simulated data from the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium (TASC), we
manage to classify pulsators with a 98% accuracy. Among them, solar-like

  Action Spaces",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-world problems of operations research are typically high-dimensional and
combinatorial. Linear programs are generally used to formulate and efficiently
solve these large decision problems. However, in multi-period decision
problems, we must often compute expected downstream values corresponding to
current decisions. When applying stochastic methods to approximate these
values, linear programs become restrictive for designing value function
approximations (VFAs). In particular, the manual design of a polynomial VFA is
challenging.
  This paper presents an integrated approach for complex optimization problems,
focusing on applications in the domain of operations research. It develops a
hybrid solution method that combines linear programming and neural networks as
part of approximate dynamic programming.
  Our proposed solution method embeds neural network VFAs into linear decision
problems, combining the nonlinear expressive power of neural networks with the
efficiency of solving linear programs. As a proof of concept, we perform
numerical experiments on a transportation problem. The neural network VFAs
consistently outperform polynomial VFAs, with limited design and tuning effort.

can alleviate the risk of overlooking the diagnosis in a clinical environment.
Towards this, as a Data Augmentation (DA) technique, Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) can synthesize additional training data to handle the
small/fragmented medical imaging datasets collected from various scanners;
those images are realistic but completely different from the original ones,
filling the data lack in the real image distribution. However, we cannot easily
use them to locate disease areas, considering expert physicians' expensive
annotation cost. Therefore, this paper proposes Conditional Progressive Growing
of GANs (CPGGANs), incorporating highly-rough bounding box conditions
incrementally into PGGANs to place brain metastases at desired positions/sizes
on 256 X 256 Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, for Convolutional Neural
Network-based tumor detection; this first GAN-based medical DA using automatic
bounding box annotation improves the training robustness. The results show that
CPGGAN-based DA can boost 10% sensitivity in diagnosis with clinically
acceptable additional False Positives. Surprisingly, further tumor realism,
achieved with additional normal brain MR images for CPGGAN training, does not
contribute to detection performance, while even three physicians cannot
accurately distinguish them from the real ones in Visual Turing Test.

For districts, a sub-state regional administrative division in India, we find
almost linear scaling of GDP with population, a result quite different from
urban functional units in other national contexts. Using deviations from
scaling, we explore the behavior of these regional units to find strong
distinct geographic patterns of economic behavior. We characterize these
patterns in detail and connect them to the literature on regional economic
development for a diverse subcontinental nation such as India. Given the
paucity of economic data for Urban Agglomerations in India, we use a set of
assumptions to create a new dataset of GDP based on districts, for large
cities. This reveals superlinear scaling of income with city size, as expected
from theory, while displaying similar underlying patterns of economic geography

often measured with various notions of discrepancy. The discrepancy function
can be defined with respect to intervals of the form $[0,t)\subset [0,1)$ or
arbitrary subintervals of the unit interval. In the former case, it is a well
known fact in discrepancy theory that the $N$-element point set in the with the
lowest $L_2$ or $L_{\infty}$ norm of the discrepancy function is the centered
regular grid
  $$ \Gamma_N:=\left\{\frac{2n+1}{2N}: n=0,1,\dots,N-1\right\}. $$
  We show a stronger result on the distribution of discrepancy functions of
point sets in $[0,1]$, which basically says that the distribution of the
discrepancy function of $\Gamma_N$ is in some sense minimal among all
$N$-element point sets. As a consequence, we can extend the above result to
rearrangement-invariant norms, including $L_p$, Orlicz and Lorentz norms. We
study the same problem for the discrepancy notions with respect to arbitrary
subintervals. In this case, we will observe that we have to deal with integrals
of convolutions of functions. To this end, we prove a general upper bound on
such expressions, which might be of independent interest as well.

show that, in contrast with conventional spatially periodic grating, a STP
diffraction grating produces spatial diffraction orders, each of which is
formed by an infinite set of temporal diffraction orders. Such spatiotemporally
periodic gratings are endowed with enhanced functionalities and exotic
characteristics, such as asymmetric diffraction pattern, nonreciprocal and
asymmetric transmission and reflection, and an enhanced diffraction efficiency.
The theory of the wave diffraction by STP gratings is formulated through
satisfying the conservation of both momentum and energy, and rigorous Floquet
mode analysis. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of the structure is
supported by time and frequency domain FDTD numerical simulations for both
transmissive and reflective STP diffraction gratings. Additionally, we provide
the conditions for Bragg and Raman-Nath diffraction regimes for STP gratings.
Finally, as a particular example of a practical application of the STP
diffraction gratings to communication systems, we propose an original multiple
access communication system featuring full-duplex operation. STP diffraction
gratings are expected to find exotic practical applications in communication
systems, especially for the realization of enhanced-efficiency or full-duplex

red supergiants (RSGs) which are the reddest (($B-V$) $>$ 1 mag) and brightest
($V$ $<$ 16 mag) objects in the VFTS. We use optical and near-IR photometry to
estimate their temperatures and luminosities, and introduce the luminosity-age
diagram to estimate their ages. We derive physical parameters for our targets,
including temperatures from a new calibration of $(J-K_{\rm s})_{0}$ colour for
luminous cool stars in the LMC, luminosities from their $J$-band magnitudes
(thence radii), and ages from comparisons with state-of-the-art evolutionary
models. We show that interstellar extinction is a significant factor for our
targets, highlighting the need to take it into account in analysis of the
physical parameters of RSGs. We find that some of the candidate RSGs could be
massive AGB stars. The apparent ages of the RSGs in the Hodge 301 and SL 639
clusters show a significant spread (12-24 Myr). We also apply our approach to
the RSG population of the relatively nearby NGC 2100 cluster, finding a
similarly large spread. We argue that the effects of mass-transfer in binaries
may lead to more massive and luminous RSGs (which we call `red stragglers')
than expected from single-star evolution, and that the true cluster ages
correspond to the upper limit of the estimated RSG ages. In this way, the RSGs
can serve as a new and potentially reliable age tracer in young star clusters.
The corresponding analysis yields ages of 24$^{+5}_{-3}$ Myr for Hodge 301,
22$^{+6}_{-5}$ Myr for SL 639, and 23$^{+4}_{-2}$ Myr for NGC 2100.

CrI3 opens a new avenue to low-dimensional spintronics. However, the low Curie
temperature Tc=45 K is still a large obstacle to its realistic device
application. In this work, we demonstrate that the Tc and magnetic moment of
CrX3(X=Br, I) can be enhanced simultaneously by coupling them to buckled
two-dimensional Mene (M=Si, Ge) to form magnetic van der Waals (vdW)
heterostructures. Our first-principles calculations reveal that n-doping of
CrX3, induced by a significant spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer from
Mene, is responsible for its drastic enhancement of Tc and magnetic moment.
Furthermore, the diversified electronic properties including halfmetallicity
and semi-conductivity with configuration dependent energy gap are also
predicted in this novel vdW heterostructure, implying their broad potential
applications in spintronics. Our study suggests that the vdW engineering may be
an efficient way to tune the magnetic properties of 2D magnets, and the
Mene_CrX3 magnetic vdW heterostructures are wonderful candidates in spintronics
and nanoelectronics device.

but the behavior of V_macrot among RRc stars varies strongly from star to star.
The RRab stars exhibit an upper limit on V_macrot of 5 +/- 1 km/s with weak
evidence of an anti-correlation with T_eff. The RRc minima range from 2 to 12
km/s. The abrupt decline in large rotations with decreasing T_eff at the blue

$d$-dimensional inputs, we provide a (close to) optimal regret of order
$O((\log n)^{d+1})$ with per-round time complexity and space complexity
$O((\log n)^{2d})$. This makes the algorithm a suitable choice as soon as $n

energy paradigm - which has been dubbed, Unified Dark Energy (UDE). The
evolution equations for the given UDE appear to correspond to a
non-conservative dark energy scenario, in which the total energy-momentum
tensor is not conserved. We investigate both the background cosmology and, the
large-scale imprint of the UDE by probing the angular power spectrum of galaxy
number counts, on ultra-large scales; taking care to include the full
relativistic corrections in the observed overdensity. The background evolution
shows that only an effective mass smaller than the Planck mass is needed in the
early universe in order for predictions in the given theory to match current
observational constraints. We found that the effective mass-evolution-rate
parameter, which drives the evolution of the UDE, acts to enhance the observed
power spectrum and, hence, relativistic effects (on ultra-large scales) by
enlarging the UDE sound horizon. Conversely, both the (beyond) Horndeski
parameter and the kineticity act to diminish the observed power spectrum, by
decreasing the UDE sound horizon. Our results show that, in a universe with
UDE, a multi-tracer analysis will be needed to detect the relativistic effects
in the large-scale structure. In the light of a multi-tracer analysis, the
various relativistic effects hold the potential to distinguish different
gravity models. Moreover, while the Doppler effect will remain significant at
all epochs and, thus can not be ignored, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe, the
time-delay and the potential (difference) effects, respectively, will only
become significant at epochs near z=3 and beyond, and may be neglected at late
epochs. In the same vein, the Doppler effect alone can serve as an effective
cosmological probe for the large-scale structure or gravity models, in the
angular power spectrum - at all z.

use the equation of motion technique to determine the retarded Green's function

for electron and hole doping of the graphene leads. The Kondo temperature
vanishes in the vicinity of the particle-hole symmetry point and at the Dirac
point. In the case of particle-hole asymmetry, the Kondo temperature has a
finite value even at the Dirac point. The influence of the on-site Coulomb
interaction and the magnetic field on the transport properties of the system
shows a tendency similar to the previous results obtained for quantum dots
connected to metallic electrodes. Most remarkably, we find that the Kondo
resonance does not show up in the density of states and in the differential
conductance for zero chemical potential due to the linear energy dispersion of
graphene. An analytical method to calculate self-energies is also developed
which can be useful in the study of graphene-based systems. Our graphene-based

isotropic turbulence using a pseudopotential lattice-Boltzmann (PP-LB) method.
Improving on previous literature by minimizing droplet dissolution and spurious
currents, we show that the PP-LB technique is capable of long, stable
simulations in certain parameter regions. Varying the dispersed phase volume
fraction $\phi$, we demonstrate that droplet breakup extracts kinetic energy
from the larger scales while injecting energy into the smaller scales,
increasingly with higher $\phi$, with the Hinze scale dividing the two effects.
Droplet size ($d$) distribution was found to follow the $d^{-10/3}$ scaling
(Deane & Stokes 2002). We show the need to maintain a separation of the
turbulence forcing scale and domain size to prevent the formation of large
connected regions of the dispersed phase. For the first time, we show that
turbulent emulsions evolve into a quasi-equilibrium cycle of alternating
coalescence and breakup dominated processes. Studying the system in its
state-space comprising kinetic energy $E_k$, enstrophy $\omega^2$ and the
droplet number density $N_d$, we find that their dynamics resemble limit-cycles
with a time delay. Extreme values in the evolution of $E_k$ manifest in the
evolution of $\omega^2$ and $N_d$ with a delay of $\sim0.3\mathcal{T}$ and
$\sim0.9\mathcal{T}$ respectively (with $\mathcal{T}$ the large eddy
timescale). Lastly, we also show that flow topology of turbulence in an
emulsion is significantly more different than single-phase turbulence than
previously thought. In particular, vortex compression and axial straining
mechanisms become dominant in the droplet phase, a consequence of the elastic
behaviour of droplet interfaces.

neurodegenerative disease. Though the diagnostic criteria of PD are relatively
well defined, the current medical imaging diagnostic procedures are
expertise-demanding, and thus call for a higher-integrated AI-based diagnostic
algorithm. Methods: In this paper, we proposed an automatic, end-to-end,
multi-modality diagnosis framework, including segmentation, registration,
feature generation and machine learning, to process the information of the
striatum for the diagnosis of PD. Multiple modalities, including T1- weighted
MRI and 11C-CFT PET, were used in the proposed framework. The reliability of
this framework was then validated on a dataset from the PET center of Huashan
Hospital, as the dataset contains paired T1-MRI and CFT-PET images of 18 Normal
(NL) subjects and 49 PD subjects. Results: We obtained an accuracy of 100% for
the PD/NL classification task, besides, we conducted several comparative
experiments to validate the diagnosis ability of our framework. Conclusion:
Through experiment we illustrate that (1) automatic segmentation has the same
classification effect as the manual segmentation, (2) the multi-modality images
generates a better prediction than single modality images, and (3) volume
feature is shown to be irrelevant to PD diagnosis.

intra-class variance and small inter-class variance. Since the subtle visual
differences are only in local regions of discriminative parts among
subcategories, part localization is a key issue for fine-grained image
classification. Most existing approaches localize object or parts in an image
with object or part annotations, which are expensive and labor-consuming. To
tackle this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised part mining (UPM) approach
to localize the discriminative parts without even image-level annotations,
which largely improves the fine-grained classification performance. We first
utilize pattern mining techniques to discover frequent patterns, i.e.,
co-occurrence highlighted regions, in the feature maps extracted from a
pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Inspired by the fact that
these relevant meaningful patterns typically hold appearance and spatial
consistency, we then cluster the mined regions to obtain the cluster centers
and the discriminative parts surrounding the cluster centers are generated.
Importantly, any annotations and sophisticated training procedures are not used
in our proposed part localization approach. Finally, a multi-stream
classification network is built for aggregating the original, object-level and
part-level features simultaneously. Compared with other state-of-the-art
approaches, our UPM approach achieves the competitive performance.

linear systems. At each step, the method projects the current iterate onto the
solution space of a single constraint. Hence, it requires very low cost per
iteration and storage, and it has a linear rate of convergence. Distributed
implementations of Kaczmarz have become, in recent years, the de facto
architectural choice for large-scale linear systems. Therefore, in this paper
we develop a family of randomized block Kaczmarz algorithms that uses at each
step a subset of the constraints and extrapolated stepsizes, and can be
deployed on distributed computing units. Our approach is based on several new
ideas and tools, including stochastic selection rule for the blocks of rows,
stochastic conditioning of the linear system, and novel strategies for
designing extrapolated stepsizes. We prove that randomized block Kaczmarz
algorithm converges linearly in expectation, with a rate depending on the
geometric properties of the matrix and its submatrices and on the size of the
blocks. Our convergence analysis reveals that the algorithm is most effective
when it is given a good sampling of the rows into well-conditioned blocks.
Besides providing a general framework for the design and analysis of randomized

sensorimotor exploration using a self-organizing neural controller. While
exploring the behavioral capabilities of its own body, the system learns
modular structures that predict the sensorimotor dynamics and generate the
associated behavior. In line with recent theories of event perception, the
system uses unexpected prediction error signals, i.e., surprise, to detect
transitions between successive behavioral primitives. We show that, when
applied to two robotic systems with completely different body kinematics, the
system manages to learn a variety of complex and realistic behavioral
primitives. Moreover, after initial self-exploration the system can use its
learned predictive models progressively more effectively for invoking model
predictive planning and goal-directed control in different tasks and

result lies a speedup technique that, for graphs of girth at least $2t+2$,
transforms any $t$-round algorithm for one specific LLL problem into a
$(t-1)$-round algorithm for the same problem. We substantially improve on this
technique by showing that such a speedup exists for any locally checkable

$(t-1)$-round algorithm solves is not (necessarily) the same problem as $\Pi$.
Our speedup is automatic in the sense that there is a fixed procedure that
transforms a description for $\Pi$ into a description for $\Pi_1$ and
reversible in the sense that any $(t-1)$-round algorithm for $\Pi_1$ can be
transformed into a $t$-round algorithm for $\Pi$. In particular, for any
locally checkable problem $\Pi$ with exact deterministic time complexity $T(n,

object detection. We leverage a large dataset of 3D background models and
densely render them using full domain randomization. This yields background
images with realistic shapes and texture on top of which we render the objects
of interest. During training, the data generation process follows a curriculum
strategy guaranteeing that all foreground models are presented to the network
equally under all possible poses and conditions with increasing complexity. As
a result, we entirely control the underlying statistics and we create optimal
training samples at every stage of training. Using a set of 64 retail objects,
we demonstrate that our simple approach enables the training of detectors that
outperform models trained with real data on a challenging evaluation dataset.

  Itemset With Multi-scale Features",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  TThe goal of our work is to discover dominant objects in a very general
setting where only a single unlabeled image is given. This is far more
challenge than typical co-localization or weakly-supervised localization tasks.
To tackle this problem, we propose a simple but effective pattern mining-based
method, called Object Location Mining (OLM), which exploits the advantages of
data mining and feature representation of pre-trained convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Specifically, we first convert the feature maps from a
pre-trained CNN model into a set of transactions, and then discovers frequent
patterns from transaction database through pattern mining techniques. We
observe that those discovered patterns, i.e., co-occurrence highlighted
regions, typically hold appearance and spatial consistency. Motivated by this
observation, we can easily discover and localize possible objects by merging
relevant meaningful patterns. Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmarks
demonstrate that OLM achieves competitive localization performance compared
with the state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our approach compared with
unsupervised saliency detection methods and achieves competitive results on
seven benchmark datasets. Moreover, we conduct experiments on fine-grained
classification to show that our proposed method can locate the entire object
and parts accurately, which can benefit to improving the classification results
significantly.

backdoor or trojan attacks embed surgically modified samples with targeted

misclassify chosen samples in the presence of specific triggers, while keeping
the model performance stable across other nominal samples. However, current
published research on trojan attacks mainly focuses on classification problems,
which ignores sequential dependency between inputs. In this paper, we propose
methods to discreetly introduce and exploit novel backdoor attacks within a
sequential decision-making agent, such as a reinforcement learning agent, by
training multiple benign and malicious policies within a single long short-term

intuition on how the trojan trigger and malicious policy is activated.
Challenges with network size and unintentional triggers are identified and

potential approaches to defend against or serve as early detection for such

encoding was performed in 42 patients with intracranial tumors (gliomas,
meningiomas, adenomas, metastases). Microscopic anisotropy and tissue
heterogeneity were evaluated by estimating the anisotropic kurtosis ($MK_A$)
and isotropic kurtosis ($MK_I$), respectively. An extensive imaging protocol

Metastases had higher tissue heterogeneity $(MK_I = 0.57\pm0.07)$ than both the

is based on the recent results on the characterization of the maximum coding
rate at finite block-length and finite block-error probability. The overall
system throughput is evaluated as a function of the number of information bits,
channel uses and power. We find what would be the respective values of these

analyze the system performance in terms of reliability and throughput when
applying the type-I ARQ protocol with limited number of retransmissions. The
throughput and outage probability are evaluated for different blocklengths and
number of information bits. Our analysis reveals that there is a trade-off
between reliability and throughput in the ARQ. While increasing the number of
retransmissions boosts reliability by minimizing the probability of reception
error, it results in more delay which decreases the throughput. Nevertheless,
the results show that NOMA always outperforms OMA in terms of throughput,

computation, which can naturally be realized in a noise-resilient way.
Geometric manipulation and decoherence-free subspace encoding are promising
ways toward robust quantum computation. Here, by combining the advantages of
both strategies, we propose and experimentally realize universal holonomic
quantum gates in both a singleloop scheme and a composite scheme, based on
nonadiabatic and non-Abelian geometric phases, in a decoherence-free subspace
with nuclear magnetic resonance. Our experiment uses only two-body resonant
spin-spin interactions and thus is experimental friendly. In particular, we
also experimentally verify that the composite scheme is more robust against the
pulse errors than the single-loop scheme. Therefore, our experiment provides a
promising way toward faithful and robust geometric quantum manipulation.

symbiotic nova AG Peg (M3/4III giant + hot white dwarf; P = 818.4 days) which
underwent a nova explosion in 1850 followed by a very slow decline that did not
end until 1996, marking the beginning of quiescence. The 19 years of quiescence
ended in June 2015, when AG Peg exhibited a Z And-type outburst with an optical
amplitude of 1.5 magnitudes.
  We have carried out accretion disk and WD photosphere synthetic spectral
modeling of a Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spectrum obtained
on June 5.618, 2003 during the quiescence interval 12 years before the 2015
outburst. The spectrum is heavily affected by ISM absorption as well as strong
emission lines. We de-reddened the FUSE fluxes assuming E(B-V) = 0.10, which is
the maximum galactic reddening in the direction of AG Peg. We discuss our
adoption of the pre-Gaia distance over the Gaia parallax. For a range of white
dwarf surface gravities and surface temperatures we find that the best-fitting
photosphere is a hot WD with a temperature T = 150,000 K, and a low gravity
log(g)~6.0-6.5. For a distance of 800 pc, the scaled WD radius is about 0.06
Rsun, giving log(g) = 6.67 for a 0.65 Msun WD mass. The Luminosity we obtain
from this model is 1729 Lsun. The hot photosphere models provide better fits
than the accretion disk models which have FUV flux deficits toward the shorter
wavelengths of FUSE, down to the Lyman Limit. Given the uncertainty of the
nature of a true symbiotic accretion disk, and, while a very hot low gravity
degenerate star dominates the FUV flux, the presence of a steady-state
(standard) accretion disk cannot be summarily ruled out.

Internet-wide services such as Twitter. Neither the buyer (i.e., consumers) nor
seller (i.e., IoT manufacturers) was known to suffer from the attack, but both
have the power to expend effort to secure their devices. We consider a
regulator who regulates payments (via fines if the device is compromised, or
market prices directly), or the product directly via mandatory security
requirements.
  Both regulations come at a cost---implementing security requirements
increases production costs, and the existence of fines decreases consumers'
values---thereby reducing the seller's profits. The focus of this paper is to
understand the \emph{efficiency} of various regulatory policies. That is,
policy A is more efficient than policy B if A more successfully minimizes
negatives externalities, while both A and B reduce seller's profits equally.
  We develop a simple model to capture the impact of regulatory policies on a
buyer's behavior. {In this model, we show that for \textit{homogeneous}
markets---where the buyer's ability to follow security practices is always high
or always low---the optimal (externality-minimizing for a given profit
constraint) regulatory policy need regulate \emph{only} payments \emph{or}
production.} In arbitrary markets, by contrast, we show that while the optimal
policy may require regulating both aspects, there is always an approximately
optimal policy which regulates just one.

  Mobile-Edge Computing","32 pages, 8 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the proliferation of computation-extensive and latency-critical
applications in the 5G and beyond networks, mobile-edge computing (MEC) or fog
computing, which provides cloud-like computation and/or storage capabilities at
the network edge, is envisioned to reduce computation latency as well as to
conserve energy for wireless devices (WDs). This paper studies a novel
device-to-device (D2D)-enabled multi-helper MEC system, in which a local user
solicits its nearby WDs serving as helpers for cooperative computation. We
assume a time division multiple access (TDMA) transmission protocol, under
which the local user offloads the tasks to multiple helpers and downloads the
results from them over orthogonal pre-scheduled time slots. Under this setup,
we minimize the computation latency by optimizing the local user's task
assignment jointly with the time and rate for task offloading and results
downloading, as well as the computation frequency for task execution, subject
to individual energy and computation capacity constraints at the local user and
the helpers. However, the formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear
program (MINLP) that is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we
propose an efficient algorithm by first relaxing the original problem into a
convex one, and then constructing a suboptimal task assignment solution based
on the obtained optimal one. Next, we consider a benchmark scheme that endows
the WDs with their maximum computation capacities. To further reduce the
implementation complexity, we also develop a heuristic scheme based on the
greedy task assignment. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness
of our proposed algorithm, as compared against the heuristic scheme and other
benchmark ones without either joint optimization of radio and computation
resources or task assignment design.

researchers. Some studies have used deep neural networks to improve the quality

a deep neural network that uses dilated convolutions with different dilation
rates instead of standard convolution helping to capture more contextual
information in fewer layers. Also, we have employed residual learning by
creating shortcut connections to transmit image information from the early
layers to later ones. To further improve the performance of the network, we
have introduced a non-trainable edge detection layer that extracts edges in
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. Finally, we demonstrate that
optimizing the network by a combination of mean-square error loss and
perceptual loss preserves many structural details in the CT image. This
objective function does not suffer from over smoothing and blurring effects
caused by per-pixel loss and grid-like artifacts resulting from perceptual
loss. The experiments show that each modification to the network improves the
outcome while only minimally changing the complexity of the network.

therefore allows interpreting those solar neutrinos can interact with this

radiation count-rates measurements, facing an Am-241 source. The system was
placed at an underground laboratory, permanently locked to avoid any influence
by unexpected radiation perturbations, and environmentally controlled in means

The detector consist of NaI(Tl) scintillators for gamma radiation and

the environment. The detection and mapping of underwater vegetation, especially
seagrass has drawn the attention of the research community as early as the
nineteen eighties. Initially, this monitoring relied on in situ observation by
experts. Later, advances in remote-sensing technology, satellite-monitoring
techniques and, digital photo- and video-based techniques opened a window to
quicker, cheaper, and, potentially, more accurate seagrass-monitoring methods.
So far, for seagrass detection and mapping, digital images from airborne
cameras, spectral images from satellites, acoustic image data using underwater
sonar technology, and digital underwater photo and video images have been used
to map the seagrass meadows or monitor their condition. In this article, we
have reviewed the recent approaches to seagrass detection and mapping to
understand the gaps of the present approaches and determine further research
scope to monitor the ocean health more easily. We have identified four classes
of approach to seagrass mapping and assessment: still image-, video data-,
acoustic image-, and spectral image data-based techniques. We have critically
analysed the surveyed approaches and found the research gaps including the need
for quick, cheap and effective imaging techniques robust to depth, turbidity,
location and weather conditions, fully automated seagrass detectors that can
work in real-time, accurate techniques for estimating the seagrass density, and
the availability of high computation facilities for processing large scale
data. For addressing these gaps, future research should focus on developing
cheaper image and video data collection techniques, deep learning based
automatic annotation and classification, and real-time percentage-cover
calculation.

to solve large problems. To do this, the nodes need to compress important

between a) the algorithm's convergence properties, b) the compression scheme,
and c) the transmission rate offered by the digital channel. We explore these
relationships for a general class of linearly convergent distributed
algorithms. In particular, we illustrate how to design quantizers for these
algorithms that compress the communicated information to a few bits while still
preserving the linear convergence. Moreover, we characterize the communication
time of these algorithms as a function of the available transmission rate. We
illustrate our results on learning algorithms using different communication
structures, such as decentralized algorithms where a single master coordinates
information from many workers and fully distributed algorithms where only
neighbours in a communication graph can communicate. We conclude that a
co-design of machine learning and communication protocols are mandatory to
flourish machine learning over networks.

the distribution of its values differs significantly from the uniform
distribution. An order $d$ tensor has partition rank 1 if it can be written as
a product of two tensors of order less than $d$, and it has partition rank at
most $k$ if it can be written as a sum of $k$ tensors of partition rank 1. In
this paper, we prove that if the analytic rank of an order $d$ tensor is at

fixed $d$ and $\mathbb{F}$, $f$ is a polynomial in $r$. This is an improvement
of a recent result of the author, where he obtained a tower-type bound. Prior
to our work, the best known bound was an Ackermann-type function in $r$ and
$d$, though it did not depend on $\mathbb{F}$. It follows from our results that
a biased polynomial has low rank; there too we obtain a polynomial dependence

proposes an innovative non-uniform adaptive method to determine the optimal
insulation thickness of external walls. First, the method is compared with a
reference solution to properly understand the features of the method, which can
provide high accuracy with less spatial nodes. Then, the adaptive method is
used to simulate the transient heat conduction through the building envelope of
buildings located in Brazil, where there is a large potential of energy
reduction. Simulations have been efficiently carried out for different wall and
roof configurations, showing that the innovative method efficiently provides a
gain of 25% on the computer run time.

during the last decade and we describe the solution for automatic cough
detection developed for the AioCare portable spirometry system. In contrast to
more popular analysis of sound and audio recordings, we fully based our
approach on airflow signals only. As the system is intended to be used in a
large variety of environments and different patients, we trained and validated
the algorithm using AioCare-collected data and the large database of spirometry
curves from the NHANES database by the American National Center for Health
Statistics. We trained different classifiers, such as logistic regression,
feed-forward artificial neural network, support vector machine, and random
forest to choose the one with the best performance. The ANN solution was
selected as the final classifier. The classification results on the test set
(AioCare data) are: 0.86 (sensitivity), 0.91 (specificity), 0.91 (accuracy) and
0.88 (F1 score). The classification methodology developed in this study is
robust for detecting cough events during spirometry measurements. As far as we
know, the solution presented in this work is the first fully reproducible
description of the automatic cough detection algorithm based totally on airflow
signals and the first cough detection implemented in a commercial spirometry
system that is to be published.

organized and productive. Recently, the AI community has applied the Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to learn the communication strategy and the
control policy for multiple agents. However, when implementing the
communication for real-world multi-agent applications, there is a more
practical limited-bandwidth restriction, which has been largely ignored by the
existing DRL-based methods. Specifically, agents trained by most previous
methods keep sending messages incessantly in every control cycle; due to
emitting too many messages, these methods are unsuitable to be applied to the
real-world systems that have a limited bandwidth to transmit the messages. To
handle this problem, we propose a gating mechanism to adaptively prune
unprofitable messages. Results show that the gating mechanism can prune more
than 80% messages with little damage to the performance. Moreover, our method
outperforms several state-of-the-art DRL-based and rule-based methods by a
large margin in both the real-world packet routing tasks and four benchmark
tasks.

Boosting Trees, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression

categorical embeddings are also applied in this task, but all attempts thus far
have used one-dimensional embeddings. The recent work of Super Characters
method using two-dimensional word embeddings achieved the state of art result
in text classification tasks, showcasing the promise of this new approach. In
this paper, we propose the SuperTML method, which borrows the idea of Super
Characters method and two-dimensional embeddings to address the problem of
classification on tabular data. For each input of tabular data, the features
are first projected into two-dimensional embeddings like an image, and then
this image is fed into fine-tuned two-dimensional CNN models for
classification. Experimental results have shown that the proposed SuperTML
method had achieved state-of-the-art results on both large and small datasets.
