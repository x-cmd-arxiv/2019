Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe), IC 2501, Hen 2-7, and PB4. The goal of
studying these objects together is that, although they have roughly similar
intermediate excitation and evolution of central stars (CSs), they display very
different evolution in their nebular structure which needs to be understood.
The morphologies and ionisation structures of the objects are investigated
using a set of emission-line maps representative of the different ionisation
zones. We use those in order to construct two-zone self-consistent
photoionisation models for each nebula to determine new model-dependent
distances, progenitor luminosities, effective temperatures and CS masses. The
physical conditions, chemical compositions, and expansion velocities and ages
of these nebulae are derived. In Hen 2-7 we discover a strong poleward-directed
jet from the presumed binary CS. Oxygen and nitrogen abundances derived from
both collisionally excited and recombination lines reveal that PB4 displays an
extreme abundance discrepancy factor, and we present evidence that this is
caused by uorescent pumping of the OII ion by the EUV continuum of an
interacting binary CS, rather than by recombination of the OIII ion. Both IC
2501 and PB4 were classified by others as Weak Emission Line Stars (WELS).
However, our emission line maps show that their recombination lines are
spatially extended in both objects, and are therefore of nebular rather than CS
origin. Given that we have found this result in a number of other PNe, this
result casts further doubt on the reliability, or even the reality, of the WELS
classification.

are known to generalize well when optimized with stochastic gradient descent

find wide and flat local minima, which have been proposed to be associated with
good generalization performance. In this paper, we observe that local minima of
modern deep networks are more than being flat or sharp. Specifically, at a
local minimum there exist many asymmetric directions such that the loss
increases abruptly along one side, and slowly along the opposite side--we
formally define such minima as asymmetric valleys. Under mild assumptions, we
prove that for asymmetric valleys, a solution biased towards the flat side
generalizes better than the exact minimizer. Further, we show that simply
averaging the weights along the SGD trajectory gives rise to such biased
solutions implicitly. This provides a theoretical explanation for the
intriguing phenomenon observed by Izmailov et al. (2018). In addition, we
empirically find that batch normalization (BN) appears to be a major cause for
asymmetric valleys.

having many desirable properties such as unbiasedness and consistency. However,
when analyzing data collected using a multi-armed bandit (MAB) experiment, the
sample mean is biased and much remains to be understood about its properties.
For example, when is it consistent, how large is its bias, and can we bound its
mean squared error? This paper delivers a thorough and systematic treatment of
the bias, risk and consistency of MAB sample means. Specifically, we identify
four distinct sources of selection bias (sampling, stopping, choosing and
rewinding) and analyze them both separately and together. We further
demonstrate that a new notion of \emph{effective sample size} can be used to
bound the risk of the sample mean under suitable loss functions. We present
several carefully designed examples to provide intuition on the different
sources of selection bias we study. Our treatment is nonparametric and
algorithm-agnostic, meaning that it is not tied to a specific algorithm or
goal. In a nutshell, our proofs combine variational representations of
information-theoretic divergences with new martingale concentration
inequalities.

open issue for modern computer vision systems due to peculiar challenges.
Firstly, the number of different items to be recognized is huge (i.e., in the
order of thousands) and rapidly changing over time. Moreover, there exist a
significant domain shift between the images that should be recognized at test
time, taken in stores by cheap cameras, and those available for training,
usually just one or a few studio-quality images per product. We propose an
end-to-end architecture comprising a GAN to address the domain shift at
training time and a deep CNN trained on the samples generated by the GAN to
learn an embedding of product images that enforces a hierarchy between product
categories. At test time, we perform recognition by means of K-NN search
against a database consisting of just one reference image per product.
Experiments addressing recognition of products present in the training datasets

electron interactions including insulating states, superconductivity, and
magnetism. Electrical transport in the high temperature regime has received
less attention but is also highly anomalous, exhibiting gigantic resistance
enhancement and non-monotonic temperature dependence. Here we report on the
evolution of the scattering mechanisms in tBLG over a wide range of temperature
and for twist angle varying from 0.75$^\circ$ - 2$^\circ$. We find that the
resistivity, $\rho$, exhibits three distinct phenomenological regimes as a
function of temperature, $T$. At low $T$ the response is dominated by
correlation and disorder physics; at high $T$ by thermal activation to higher
moir\'e subbands; and at intermediate temperatures $\rho$ varies linearly with
$T$. The $T$-linear response is much larger than in monolayer graphenefor all
measured twist angles, and increases by more than three orders of magnitude for
$\theta$ near the flat-band condition. Our results point to the dominant role
of electron-phonon scattering in twisted layer systems, with possible
implications for the origin of the observed superconductivity.

to the three-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell system in the exterior of a light cone.
The plasma does not have to be neutral and no compact support assumptions are
required on the data. In particular, the initial decay in the velocity variable
of the particle density is optimal and we only require an $L^2$ bound on the
electromagnetic field with no additional weight. We use vector field methods to
derive improved decay estimates in null directions for the electromagnetic
field, the particle density and their derivatives. In contrast with
\cite{dim3}, where we studied the behavior of the solutions in the whole
spacetime, the initial data have less decay and we do not need to modify the
commutation vector fields of the relativistic transport operator. To control
the solutions under these assumptions, we crucially use the strong decay
satisfied by the particle density in the exterior of the light cone, null
properties of the Vlasov equation and certain hierarchies in the energy norms.

  Background Claims made in science papers are coming under increased scrutiny
with many claims failing to replicate. Meta-analysis studies that use
unreliable observational studies should be in question. We examine the
reliability of the base studies used in an air quality/heart attack
meta-analysis and the resulting meta-analysis.
  Methods A meta-analysis study that includes 14 observational air
quality/heart attack studies is examined for its statistical reliability. We
use simple counting to evaluate the reliability of the base papers and a
p-value plot of the p-values from the base studies to examine study
heterogeneity.
  Findings We find that the based papers have massive multiple testing and
multiple modeling with no statistical adjustments. Statistics coming from the
base papers are not guaranteed to be unbiased, a requirement for a valid
meta-analysis. There is study heterogeneity for the base papers with strong
evidence for so called p-hacking.
  Interpretation We make two observations: there are many claims at issue in
each of the 14 base studies so uncorrected multiple testing is a serious issue.
We find the base papers and the resulting meta-analysis are unreliable.

the adhesion energy, charge transfer, and band structure of these

also to the stacking order. Difference in work function dictates the direction
and amount of electron transfer across the interface, which causes a shift in
the Dirac point of the graphene bands in the heterostructures of monolayer
graphene and monolayer MXene. In the heterostructures of bilayer graphene and
monolayer MXene, the interface breaks the symmetry of the bilayer graphene; in
the case of the AB-stacking bilayer, the electron transfer leads to an
interfacial electric field that opens up a gap in the graphene bands at the K
point. This internal polarization strengthens both the interfacial adhesions

may help investors realize the true risks of their investments, help prevent
recessions like that of 2008, and increase financial literacy amongst students.
Using several original Python programs, we take a correlation matrix with
correlations between the stock prices and then transform that into a graphable
binary adjacency matrix. From this graph, we take a graph in which each edge
represents weak correlations between two stocks. Finding the largest complete
graph will produce a diversified portfolio. Numerous trials have shown that
diversified portfolios consistently outperform the market during times of
economic stability, but undiversified portfolios prove to be riskier and more
unpredictable, either producing huge profits or even larger losses.
Furthermore, once deciding among which stocks our portfolio would consist of,
how do we know when to invest in each stock to maximize profits? Can taking
stock price data and shifting values help predict how a stock will perform
today if another stock performs a certain way n days prior? It was found that
this method of predicting the optimal time to investment failed to improve
returns when based solely on correlations. Although a trial with random stocks
with varied correlations produced more profits than continuously investing.

significant impact on performance. In particular, caches play a key role in the
cloud due to the nature of large-scale, data-intensive processing. One of the
key challenges for the cloud providers is how to share the caching capacity
among tenants, under the circumstance that each often requires a different
degree of quality of service (QoS) with respect to data access performance. The
invariant is that the individual tenants' QoS requirements should be satisfied
while the cache usage is optimized in a system-wide manner. In this paper, we
introduce a learning-based approach for dynamic cache management in a cloud,
which is based on the estimation of data access pattern of a tenant and the
prediction of cache performance for the access pattern in question. We consider
a variety of probability distributions to estimate the data access pattern, and
examine a set of learning-based regression techniques to predict the cache hit
rate for the access pattern. The predicted cache hit rate is then used to make
a decision whether reallocating cache space is needed to meet the QoS
requirement for the tenant. Our experimental results with an extensive set of
synthetic traces and the YCSB benchmark show that the proposed method
consistently optimizes the cache space while satisfying the QoS requirement.

have been measured, it is likely that magnetic field is i) responsible of
reducing the star formation rate in dense molecular cloud gas by a factor of a
few, ii) strongly shaping the interstellar gas by generating a lot of filaments
and reducing the numbers of clumps, cores and stars, although its exact
influence remains to be better understood. % by a factor on the order of at

Motes in Phoenix exchange their time-related state with their neighbors,
establishing a chain of transitive temporal relationships to one or more motes
with references to the global time. These relationships allow Phoenix to
reconstruct the measurement timeline for each mote. Results from simulations
and a deployment indicate that Phoenix can achieve timing accuracy up to 6 ppm
for 99% of the collected measurements. Phoenix is able to maintain this
performance for periods that last for months without a persistent global time
source. To achieve this level of performance for the targeted environmental
monitoring application, Phoenix requires an additional space overhead of 4% and
an additional duty cycle of 0.2%.

automated deep learning ensemble methods for accurate lesion boundary
segmentation in dermoscopic images. We trained the Mask-RCNN and DeepLabv3+
methods on ISIC-2017 segmentation training set and evaluate the performance of
the ensemble networks on ISIC-2017 testing set. Our results showed that the
best proposed ensemble method segmented the skin lesions with Jaccard index of

mass ejections (CME's. In view of this association, there has been an
expectation that, by scaling from solar flares to the flares which are observed
on M dwarfs, radio emission analogous to solar Type II bursts should be
detectable in association with M dwarf flares. However, several surveys have
revealed that this expectation does not seem to be fulfilled. Here we
hypothesize that the presence of larger global field strengths in low-mass
stars, suggested by recent magneto-convective modeling, gives rise to such
large Alfven speeds in the corona that it becomes difficult to satisfy the
conditions for the generation of Type II radio bursts. As a result, CME's
propagating in the corona/wind of a flare stars are expected to be
""radio-quiet"" as regards Type II bursts. In view of this, we suggest that, in
the context of Type II bursts, scaling from solar to stellar flares is of
limited effectiveness.

localized phase settles above a critical resetting rate, or rate of memory use,
and the probability density asymptotically adopts in this regime a
non-equilibrium steady state similar to that of the well known problem of
diffusion with resetting to the origin. The transition occurs because of the
presence of a single impurity site where the resetting rate is lower than on
other sites, and around which the walker spontaneously localizes. Near
criticality, the localization length diverges with a critical exponent that
falls in the same class as the self-consistent theory of Anderson localization
of waves in random media. The critical dimensions are also the same in both

technique, robust principle component analysis (RPCA), which similarly
estimates a deterministic low dimensional representation of the background in

optimization variables in a higher-dimensional space, the weighted sum-spectral
efficiency maximization is formulated as the maximization of the product of
Rayleigh quotients. Although this is still a non-convex problem, a
computationally efficient algorithm, referred to as generalized power iteration
precoding (GPIP), is proposed. The algorithm converges to a stationary point
(local maximum) of the objective function and therefore it guarantees the
first-order optimality of the solution. By adjusting the weights in the
weighted sum-spectral efficiency, the GPIP yields a joint solution for user
selection, power allocation, and downlink precoding. The GPIP is also extended
to a multi-cell scenario, where cooperative base stations perform joint user
selection and design their precoding vectors by sharing global yet imperfect
CSIT within the cooperative BSs. System-level simulations show the gains of the
proposed approach with respect to conventional user selection and linear
downlink precoding.

This property of having occasional gamma-ray emitting events is similar to that

with opposite momenta. We find that these two Raman couplings can be used to
tune the spin polarization in momentum space, thus greatly modifies the
effective scatterings over the Bloch bands. We observe a transition from the
Bloch plane wave phase with condensate at one wave vector to the Bloch stripe
phase with condensates at the two Bloch states with opposite wave vectors.
These two phases will exhibit totally different spin textures and density
modulations in real space, which are totally different from that in free space.
In momentum space multiple peaks differ by some reciprocal lattice vectors can
be observed, reflecting the periodic structure of the ODPP. A three-band
effective model is proposed to understand these observations. This system can
provide a new platform in investigating of various physics, such as collective
excitations, polaron and topological superlfuids, over the Bloch bands.

Analog beamforming and combining suffer from a subspace sampling limitation,

To resolve this, the transmitter and the receiver usually collaborate to

This is done by evaluating a limited number of codewords chosen from a

the outage, and the average data rate. The flexibility of our framework enables
us to design beamforming codebooks for any array shapes including uniform

evolution of a new low-density Co-Ni-Al-Mo-Nb based superalloy is presented.
Addition of Re significantly influences the {\gamma}' precipitate morphology,
the {\gamma}/{\gamma}' lattice misfit and the {\gamma}/{\gamma}'
microstructural stability during long term aging. An addition of 2 at.% Re to a
Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb (all in at.%) alloy, aged at 900{\deg}C for 50 hours,
reduces the {\gamma}/{\gamma}' lattice misfit by {\approx} 40% (from +0.32% to
+0.19%, measured at room temperature) and hence alters the {\gamma}' morphology
from cuboidal to round-cornered cuboidal precipitates. The composition profiles
across the {\gamma}/{\gamma}' interface by atom probe tomography (APT) reveals
Re partitions to the {\gamma} phase (K_Re=0.34) and also results in the
partitioning reversal of Mo to the {\gamma} phase (K_Mo=0.90) from the
{\gamma}' precipitate. An inhomogeneous distribution of Gibbsian interfacial
excess for the solute Re ({\Gamma}_Re, ranging from 0.8 to 9.6 atom.nm-2) has
been observed at the {\gamma}/{\gamma}' interface. A coarsening study at
900{\deg}C (up to 1000 hours) suggests that the coarsening of {\gamma}'
precipitates occurs solely by an evaporation--condensation (EC) mechanism. This
is contrary to that observed in the Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Nb alloy as well as in
some of the Ni-Al based and high mass density Co-Al-W based superalloys, where
{\gamma}' precipitates coarsen by coagulation/coalescence mechanism with
extensive alignment of {\gamma}' along <100> directions as a sign of
microstructural instability. The {\gamma}' coarsening rate exponent (K_r) and
{\gamma}/{\gamma}' interfacial energy are estimated to be 1.41 x 10-27 m3/s and
8.4 mJ/m2, which are comparable and lower than Co-Al-W based superalloys.

various electromechanical and magnetomechanical coupling phenomena. If the
pulled back metric of the current configuration (the right Cauchy-Green tensor)
is scaled with a constant, the volumetric part of the Lagrange density changes
while the isochoric part remains invariant. However, upon a position dependent
scaling, the isochoric part also loses invariance. In order to restore the
invariance of the isochoric part, a 1-form compensating field is introduced and
the notion of a gauge covariant derivative is utilized to minimally replace the
Lagrangian. In view of obvious similarities with the Weyl geometry, the Weyl
condition is imposed through the Lagrangian and a minimal coupling is employed
so the 1-form could evolve. On deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations based on
the action functional, we observe a close similarity with the governing
equations for flexoelectricity under isochoric deformation if the exact part of
1-form is interpreted as the electric field and the anti-exact part as the
polarization vector. Next, we model piezoelectricity and electrostriction
phenomena by contracting the Weyl condition in various ways. Applying the Hodge
decomposition theorem on the 1-form which leads to the curl of a pseudo-vector
field and a vector field, we also model magnetomechanical phenomena.
Identifying the pseudo-vector field with magnetic potential and the vector part
with magnetization, flexomagnetism, piezomagnetism and magnetostriction
phenomena under isochoric deformation are also modeled. Finally, we consider an
analytical solution of the equations for piezoelectricity to provide an
illustration on the insightful information that the present approach
potentially provides.

that when rotation is sufficiently fast ($\epsilon$ reaches $0.1$) a great

rotation corresponds to a lower tidal frequency. Friction suppresses tidal
resonances but cannot completely suppress them at fast rotation. The thickness
of fluid layer can change tidal resonances but this change becomes weaker at

problem, which converges theoretically to the incompressible Navier--Stokes
equations, and is discretized in space by generalized approximate operators
defined as a wider class of approximate operators than those of the smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) methods.
By considering an analytical derivation of the explicit particle method and
truncation error estimates of the generalized approximate operators, sufficient
conditions of convergence are conjectured.Under these conditions, the
convergence of the explicit particle method is confirmed by numerically
comparing errors between exact and approximate solutions. Moreover, by focusing
on the truncation errors of the generalized approximate operators, an optimal
weight function is derived by reducing the truncation errors over general
particle distributions. The effectiveness of the generalized approximate
operators with the optimal weight functions is confirmed using numerical
results of truncation errors and driven cavity flow. As an application for flow
problems with free surface effects, the explicit particle method is applied to

conclusions about the quantum systems under consideration. In some cases this
yields a characterisation which is essentially complete, a phenomenon known as
self-testing. Self-testing becomes particularly interesting if we can make the
statement robust, so that it can be applied to a real experimental setup. For
the simplest self-testing scenarios the most robust bounds come from the method
based on operator inequalities. In this work we elaborate on this idea and
apply it to the family of tilted CHSH inequalities. These inequalities are
maximally violated by partially entangled two-qubit states and our goal is to
estimate the quality of the state based only on the observed violation. For
these inequalities we have reached a candidate bound and while we have not been
able to prove it analytically, we have gathered convincing numerical evidence
that it holds. Our final contribution is a proof that in the usual formulation,
the CHSH inequality only becomes a self-test when the violation exceeds a
certain threshold. This shows that self-testing scenarios fall into two
distinct classes depending on whether they exhibit such a threshold or not.

single-point turbulent velocity field records is presented. Manual selection of
the method sensitivity (tau*) and threshold (eT) are necessary for effective
discrimination between burst periods and the background turbulent flow
fluctuations (burst-free periods). The flow characteristic used for
identification is the normalized 'instantaneous' TKE dissipation rate levels,
calculated using sliding window averaging. Use of the record root mean square
and average values for normalization eliminates the need for definition of a
physics-based flow-specific threshold. Instead, the suitable sensitivity range
and the threshold parameters are selected based on preliminary examination of
the velocity records. This, potentially, makes the method applicable for use
across various flow fields, especially as it does not require resolving the
burst-generation mechanism. The method performance is examined using a field
obtained dataset of buoyancy driven turbulent boundary layer flow. Here, the
selection of a two-fold (eT=2) increase is used and the sensitivity of the
method is examined. Spectral shapes of non-bursting periods show distinguished
similarity to those of the Kolmogorov theory, while the bursting period
spectral shapes vary significantly. Low resolution records of temperature
fluctuations were observed to exhibit a significant decrease in temperature
(scalar) dissipation rate during bursting periods. Based on this observation
and additional processing, a statistical examination of temperature (scalar)
dissipation rate is presented along with a normalization procedure. Future
examination of additional scalar variations, i.e. particulate matter and/or
gaseous pollutant concentrations, in connection with turbulent bursting periods
can assist in further understanding of bursting generation and scalar transfer

securing communications over the Internet. Currently, PKIs are under the
control of centralized authorities, which is problematic as evidenced by
numerous incidents where they have been compromised. The distributed, fault
tolerant log of transactions provided by blockchains and more recently, smart
contract platforms, constitutes a powerful tool for the decentralization of
PKIs. To verify the validity of identity records, blockchain-based identity
systems store on chain either all identity records, or, a small (or even
constant) sized amount of data to verify identity records stored off chain.
However, as most of these systems have never been implemented, there is little
information regarding the practical implications of each design's tradeoffs.
  In this work, we first implement and evaluate the only provably secure, smart
contract based PKI of [1] on top of Ethereum. This construction incurs
constant-sized storage at the expense of computational complexity. To explore
this tradeoff, we propose and implement a second construction which, eliminates
the need for trusted setup, preserves the security properties of [1] and, as
illustrated through our evaluation, is the only version with constant-sized
state that can be deployed on the live chain of Ethereum. Furthermore, we
compare these two systems with the simple approach of most prior works, e.g.,
the Ethereum Name Service, where all identity records are stored on the smart
contract's state, to illustrate several shortcomings of Ethereum and its cost
model. We propose several modifications for fine tuning the model, which would
be useful to be considered for any smart contract platform like Ethereum so
that it reaches its full potential to support arbitrary distributed
applications.

enhancement of wavefunction intensity near classical periodic orbits, and it
can be characterized by a local density of states (or local spectrum) that
clearly deviates from RMT expectations, by exhibiting a peaked envelope, which
has been described semiclassically. Here, the system is connected to an
opening, the local density of states is introduced for the resulting
non-Hermitian chaotic Hamiltonian, and estimated a priori in terms of the
Green's function of the closed system and the open channels. The predictions
obtained are tested on quantum maps coupled both to a single-channel opening
and to a Fresnel-type continuous opening. The main outcome is that strong
coupling to the opening gradually suppresses the energy dependence of the local
density of states due to scarring, and restores RMT behavior.

distributed applications in a simple manner. This simplicity stems from the
inherent utility of employing the state of smart contracts to store, query and
verify the validity of application data. In Ethereum, data storage incurs an
underpriced, non-recurring, predefined fee. Furthermore, as there is no
incentive for freeing or minimizing the state of smart contracts, Ethereum is
faced with a tragedy of the commons problem with regards to its monotonically
increasing state. This issue, if left unchecked, may lead to centralization and
directly impact Ethereum's security and longevity. In this work, we introduce
an alternative paradigm for developing smart contracts in which their state is
of constant size and facilitates the verification of application data that are
stored to and queried from an external, potentially unreliable, storage
network. This approach is relevant for a wide range of applications, such as
any key-value store. We evaluate our approach by adapting the most widely
deployed standard for fungible tokens, i.e., the ERC20 token standard. We show
that Ethereum's current cost model penalizes our approach, even though it
minimizes the overhead to Ethereum's state and aligns well with Ethereum's
future. We address Ethereum's monotonically increasing state in a two-fold
manner. First, we introduce recurring fees that are proportional to the state
of smart contracts and adjustable by the miners that maintain the network.
Second, we propose a scheme where the cost of storage-related operations
reflects the effort that miners have to expend to execute them. Lastly, we show
that under such a pricing scheme that encourages economy in the state consumed
by smart contracts, our ERC20 token adaptation reduces the incurred transaction
fees by up to an order of magnitude.

  Distance Metric Learning",,,,,"eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and detection error tradeoff (DET)
curves are two widely used evaluation metrics for speaker verification. They
are equivalent since the latter can be obtained by transforming the former's
true positive y-axis to false negative y-axis and then re-scaling both axes by
a probit operator. Real-world speaker verification systems, however, usually
work on part of the ROC curve instead of the entire ROC curve given an
application. Therefore, we propose in this paper to use the area under part of
the ROC curve (pAUC) as a more efficient evaluation metric for speaker
verification. A Mahalanobis distance metric learning based back-end is applied
to optimize pAUC, where the Mahalanobis distance metric learning guarantees
that the optimization objective of the back-end is a convex one so that the
global optimum solution is achievable. To improve the performance of the
state-of-the-art speaker verification systems by the proposed back-end, we
further propose two feature preprocessing techniques based on
length-normalization and probabilistic linear discriminant analysis
respectively. We evaluate the proposed systems on the major languages of NIST
SRE16 and the core tasks of SITW. Experimental results show that the proposed
back-end outperforms the state-of-the-art speaker verification back-ends in
terms of seven evaluation metrics.

drift speed through nitrogen buffer gas in the first IMS stage before being
exposed to a pulse of tunable light that induces either photodissociation or
electron photodetachment, which is conveniently monitored by scavenging the
detached electrons with trace \ce{SF6} in the buffer gas. The photodetachment
action spectrum of the 2-naphtholate anion exhibits a band system spanning
380-460\,nm~with a prominent series of peaks spaced by 440\,\cme, commencing at
458.5\,nm, and a set of weaker peaks near the electron detachment threshold
corresponding to transitions to dipole-bound states. The two deprotomers of
6-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid are separated and spectroscopically probed
independently. The molecular anion formed from deprotonation of the hydroxy

2-naphtholate anion with an onset at 470\,nm and a maximum at 420\,nm. Near
threshold, photoreaction with \ce{SF6} is observed with displacement of an OH
group by an F atom. In contrast, the anion formed from deprotonation of the
carboxylic acid group features a photodissociation action spectrum, recorded on
the \ce{CO2} loss channel, lying to much shorter wavelength with an onset at
360\,nm and maximum photoresponse at 325\,nm.

statistical hypotheses assumes that the test statistics are drawn independently
from a mixture of a high probability null distribution and a low probability
alternative. Optimal control of the marginal false discovery rate (mFDR), in
the sense that it provides maximal power (expected true discoveries) subject to
mFDR control, is known to be achieved by thresholding the local false discovery
rate (locFDR), i.e., the probability of the hypothesis being null given the set
of test statistics, with a fixed threshold. We address the challenge of
controlling optimally the popular false discovery rate (FDR) or positive FDR
(pFDR) rather than mFDR in the general two-group model, which also allows for
dependence between the test statistics. These criteria are less conservative
than the mFDR criterion, so they make more rejections in expectation. We derive
their optimal multiple testing (OMT) policies, which turn out to be
thresholding the locFDR with a threshold that is a function of the entire set
of statistics. We develop an efficient algorithm for finding these policies,
and use it for problems with thousands of hypotheses. We illustrate these
procedures on gene expression studies.

forming two sets of Weyl nodal point-line fermions near the Fermi level. The
novel properties of Weyl nodal point-line fermion are explored by revealing the

subject to un-modeled and disturbance terms. The un-modeled and disturbance
terms are regarded as extended states for which observers are designed to
estimate them. Compensating the players' dynamics with the observed values, the
control laws are designed to achieve the robust seeking of the Nash equilibrium
for networked games. Firstly, we consider the case in which the players'
dynamics are subject to bounded disturbances only. In this case, the seeking
strategy is developed by employing a smooth observer based on the
Proportional-Integral (PI) control. By utilizing the designed strategy, we show
that the players' actions would converge to a small neighborhood of the Nash
equilibrium. Moreover, the ultimate bound can be adjusted to be arbitrarily
small by tuning the control gains. Then, we further consider the case in which
both an un-modeled term and a disturbance term coexist in the players'
dynamics. In this case, we adapt the idea from the Robust Integral of the Sign
of the Error (RISE) method in the strategy design to achieve the asymptotic
seeking of the Nash equilibrium. Both strategies are analytically investigated
via the Lyapunov stability analysis. The applications of the proposed methods

without, the presence of an absorbing boundary. Given a Brownian trajectory
that evolved for $t$ units of time, the local time is simply defined as the
total time the trajectory spent in a small vicinity of its initial position.
However, as Brownian trajectories are stochastic --- the local time itself is a
random variable which fluctuates round and about its mean value. In the past,
the statistics of these fluctuations has been quantified in detail; but not in
the presence of resetting which biases the particle to spend more time near its
starting point. Here, we extend past results to include the possibility of
stochastic resetting with, and without, the presence of an absorbing boundary
and/or drift. We obtain exact results for the moments and distribution of the
local time and these reveal that its statistics usually admits a simple form in
the long-time limit. And yet, while fluctuations in the absence of stochastic
resetting are typically non-Gaussian --- resetting gives rise to Gaussian
fluctuations. The analytical findings presented herein are in excellent
agreement with numerical simulations.

applications in training deep neural nets and other nonconvex models. While the
behavior of SGD is well understood in the convex learning setting, the existing
theoretical results for SGD applied to nonconvex objective functions are far
from mature. For example, existing results require to impose a nontrivial
assumption on the uniform boundedness of gradients for all iterates encountered
in the learning process, which is hard to verify in practical implementations.
In this paper, we establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for SGD in
nonconvex learning by showing that this boundedness assumption can be removed
without affecting convergence rates. In particular, we establish sufficient
conditions for almost sure convergence as well as optimal convergence rates for
SGD applied to both general nonconvex objective functions and
gradient-dominated objective functions. A linear convergence is further derived
in the case with zero variances.

this end, the vision of the Web of Things (WoT) is to leverage Web standards in

make them a part of the World Wide Web (WWW) and provide overall
interoperability. In this context we introduce Smart Web Services (SmartWS)
that not only provide remote access to resources and functionalities, by
relying on standard communication protocols, but also encapsulate
`intelligence'. Smartness features can include, for instance, context-based
adaptation, cognition, inference and rules that implement autonomous decision

of the users, without requiring their explicit involvement. In this paper, we
present the key characteristics of SmartWS, and introduce a reference

implementing SmartWS in the medical domain and specify a maturity model for

hypergraph minimal transversal. The problem of extracting the minimal
transversals from a hypergraph received the interest of many researchers as
shown the number of algorithms proposed in the literature, and this is mainly
due to the solutions offered by the minimal transversal in various application
areas such as databases, artificial intelligence, e-commerce, semantic web,
etc. In view of the wide range of fields of minimal transversal application and
the interest they generate, the objective of this thesis is to explore new
application paths of minimal transversal by proposing methods to optimize the
extraction. This has led to three proposed contributions in this thesis. The
first approach takes advantage of the emergence of Web 2.0 and, therefore,
social networks using minimal transversal for the detection of important actors
within these networks. The second part of research in this thesis has focused
on reducing the number of hypergraph minimal transversal. A concise and
accurate representation of minimal transversal was proposed and is based on the
construction of an irredundant hypergraph, hence are calculated the irredundant
minimal transversal of the initial hypergraph. An application of this
representation to the dependency inference problem is presented to illustrate
the usefulness of this approach. The last approach includes the hypergraph
decomposition into partial hypergraph the local minimal transversal are
calculated and their Cartesian product can generate all the hypergraph
transversal sets. Different experimental studies have shown the value of these
proposed approaches.

combines features of flow cytometry with fluorescence and bright field

cytometry with the ability to discretely measure events based on a real or
computational image, as well as conventional flow cytometry metrics. A
limitation of existing IFC systems is that, regardless of detection
methodology, only two-dimensional (2D) cell images are obtained. Without
tomographic three-dimensional (3D) resolution the projection problem remains:
collapsing 3D information onto a 2D image, limiting the reliability of spot
counting or co-localization crucial to cell phenotyping. Here we present a
solution to the projection problem: three-dimensional imaging flow cytometry
(3D-IFC), a high-throughput 3D cell imager based on optical sectioning
microscopy. We combine orthogonal light-sheet scanning illumination with our
previous spatiotemporal transformation detection to produce 3D cell image
reconstruction from a cameraless single-pixel photodetector readout. We further
demonstrate this capability by co-capturing 3D fluorescence and label-free
side-scattering images of single cells in flow at a velocity of 0.2 m s-1,
corresponding to a throughput of approximately 500 cells per second with 60,000
voxels (resized subsequently to 106 voxels) for each cell image at a resolution
of less than 1 micron in X, Y, and Z dimensions. Improved high-throughput

finite element framework is developed. Arbitrarily shaped embedded surfaces,
cutting through finite element meshes, are handled by the X-FEM. The frictional
contact problem is solved using the monolithic augmented Lagrangian method
within the mortar framework which was adapted for handling embedded surfaces.
We report that the resulting mixed formulation is prone to mesh locking in case
of high elastic and mesh density contrasts across the contact interface. The
mesh locking manifests itself in spurious stress oscillations in the vicinity
of the contact interface. We demonstrate that in the classical patch test,
these oscillations can be removed simply by using triangular blending elements.
In a more general case, the triangulation is shown inefficient, therefore
stabilization of the problem is achieved by adopting a recently proposed
coarse-graining interpolation of Lagrange multipliers. Moreover, we demonstrate
that the coarse-graining is also beneficial for the classical mortar method to
avoid spurious oscillations for contact interfaces with high elastic contrast.
The performance of this novel method, called MorteX, is demonstrated on several
examples which show as accurate treatment of frictional contact along embedded
surfaces as the classical mortar method along boundary fitted surfaces.

the tying interface. To overcome this inherent difficulty, we suggest a new
coarse-grained interpolation of Lagrange multipliers. This technique consists
in selective assignment of Lagrange multipliers on nodes of the mortar side and
in non-local interpolation of the associated traction field. The optimal choice
of the coarse-graining spacing is guided solely by the mesh-density contrast
between the mesh of the mortar side and the number of blending elements of the
host mesh. The method is tested on two patch tests (compression and bending)
for different interpolations and element types as well as for different
material and mesh contrasts. The optimal mesh convergence and removal of

high contrasts of inclusion/matrix materials. Few additional examples confirm

and many successful outcomes benefit from strokes of luck. But success is
subject to complexity, uncertainty, and change - and at times becoming
increasingly unequally distributed. This leads to tension and confusion over to
what extent people actually get what they deserve (i.e., fairness/meritocracy).
Moreover, in many fields, humans are over-confident and pervasively confuse
luck for skill (I win, it's skill; I lose, it's bad luck). In some fields,
there is too much risk taking; in others, not enough. Where success derives in
large part from luck - and especially where bailouts skew the incentives
(heads, I win; tails, you lose) - it follows that luck is rewarded too much.
This incentivizes a culture of gambling, while downplaying the importance of
productive effort. And, short term success is often rewarded, irrespective, and
potentially at the detriment, of the long-term system fitness. However, much
success is truly meritocratic, and the problem is to discern and reward based
on merit. We call this the fair reward problem. To address this, we propose
three different measures to assess merit: (i) raw outcome; (ii) risk adjusted
outcome, and (iii) prospective. We emphasize the need, in many cases, for the
deductive prospective approach, which considers the potential of a system to
adapt and mutate in novel futures. This is formalized within an evolutionary
system, comprised of five processes, inter alia handling the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. Several human endeavors - including
finance, politics, and science -are analyzed through these lenses, and concrete
solutions are proposed to support a prosperous and meritocratic society.

material, a general constitutive law extensively applied in explosion and high
speed impact dynamics, and provide a natural transformation between the fluid
and solid in the case of phase transitions. The hydrostatic components of the
solid is described by a family of general Mie-Gr\""uneisen equation of state
(EOS), while the deviatoric component includes the elastic phase, linearly
hardened plastic phase and fluid phase. The approximate solver provides the
interface stress and normal velocity by an iterative method. The well-posedness
and convergence of our solver are proved with mild assumptions on the equations
of state. The proposed solver is applied in computing the numerical flux at the
phase interface for our compressible multi-medium flow simulation on Eulerian
girds. Several numerical examples, including Riemann problems, shock-bubble
interactions, implosions and high speed impact applications, are presented to
validate the approximate solver.

the predicted results; authors of pro-NSSI posts used demonstrated expected
results of first-person singular pronouns extensively, which indicatesing high
levels of mental health distress and isolation. The psychological linguistic
properties that could be observed of in these public Reddit posts were
dominantly in a negative emotional tone which demonstrates youth and
impulsivity. The linguistic properties found when these posts were analyzed
supports the work of earlier studies that dispelled common myths about NSSI
that were circulating in the mental health community. These findings suggest
that the language of people who engage in NSSI supports research findings in
dispelling common myths about NSSI.

  Cellular Automata Simulation","17th IEEE International Conference on Smart City (SmartCity)",,"10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00371",,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To minimize property loss and death count in terror attacks and other
emergent scenarios, attention given to timely and effective evacuation cannot
be enough. Due to limited evacuation resource, i.e., number of available exits,
there exists interdependence among pedestrians such as cooperation, competition
and herd effect. Thus human factors - more specifically, pedestrians' behavior
in emergency evacuation - play a significant role in evacuation research.
Effective evacuation can only be reached when route planning are considered in
conjunction with psychological dynamics, which is often ignored. As another
drawback, previous research assumes the environment including available exits
as stationary. However, we note that during emergency, some exits which are not
often utilized in normal times are opened, which potentially helps if
pedestrians are aware of them. In this paper, we analyze the effect of
pedestrians' behavior, i.e., herd effect and knowledge of changing environment
with Cellular Automata (CA) simulation. Results of the simulation show the
harmful effect of herd effect as well as highlight the importance of timely
informing pedestrians of environmental change. Accordingly, we propose policy
and procedural recommendations for emergency management of large, crowded
structures. Our future work includes considering more human factors and
applying our model to log data provided by videos in public venues, which can
further show effectiveness of our model in real scenarios.

increase the performance of computing circuits. Here we propose to employ
ferroelectrics for the material implementation of MVL units basing on their
ability to pin the polarization as a sequence of multi-stable states. Two
conceptual ideas are considered. As the first system, we suggest using the
strained ferroelectric films that can host the polarization states, allowing
the effective field-induced multilevel switching between them. As the second
one, we propose to employ the ferroelectric nano-samples that confine the
topologically protected polarization textures, which may be used as MVL
structural elements. We demonstrate that these systems are suitable for
engineering of the 3-, 4- and even 5-level logic units and consider the circuit
design for such elements.
