together in a language universal space. It allows models to share parameters
and transfer knowledge across languages, enabling faster and better adaptation
to a new language. These approaches are particularly useful for low resource
languages. In this paper, we propose a phoneme-level language model that can be
used multilingually and for crosslingual adaptation to a target language. We
show that our model performs almost as well as the monolingual models by using
six times fewer parameters, and is capable of better adaptation to languages
not seen during training in a low resource scenario. We show that these
phoneme-level language models can be used to decode sequence based
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) acoustic model outputs to obtain
comparable word error rates with Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based
decoding in Babel languages. We also show that these phoneme-level language
models outperform WFST decoding in various low-resource conditions like
adapting to a new language and domain mismatch between training and testing
data.

$k \ge 3$, if a $3$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $n$ vertices does not contain a
set of $k+3$ vertices spanning at least $k$ edges then it has $o(n^2)$ edges.
The case $k=3$ of this conjecture is the celebrated $(6,3)$-theorem of Ruzsa
and Szemer\'edi which implies Roth's theorem on $3$-term arithmetic
progressions in dense sets of integers. Solymosi observed that, in order to
prove the conjecture, one can assume that $H$ consists of triples $(a, b, ab)$
of some finite quasigroup $\Gamma$. Since this problem remains open for all $k
\geq 4$, he further proposed to study triple systems coming from finite groups.
In this case he proved that the conjecture holds also for $k = 4$. Here we
completely resolve the Brown-Erd\H{o}s-S\'os conjecture for all finite groups
and values of $k$. Moreover, we prove that the hypergraphs coming from groups
contain sets of size $\Theta(\sqrt{k})$ which span $k$ edges. This is best
possible and goes far beyond the conjecture.

waiting times or queue lengths via delay announcements. However, in many cases,
either the information might be delayed or customers might require time to
travel to the queue of their choice, thus causing a lag in information. In this
paper, we construct a neutral delay differential equation (NDDE) model for the
queue length process and explore the use of velocity information in our delay
announcement. Our results illustrate that using velocity information can have
either a beneficial or detrimental impact on the system. Thus, it is important
to understand how much velocity information a manager should use. In some
parameter settings, we show that velocity information can eliminate
oscillations created by delays in information. We derive a fixed point equation
for determining the optimal amount of velocity information that should be used
and find closed form upper and lower bounds on its value. When the oscillations
cannot be eliminated altogether, we identify the amount of velocity information
that minimizes the amplitude of the oscillations. However, we also find that
using too much velocity information can create oscillations in the queue
lengths that would otherwise be stable.

and Push&Pull. A key property of all these models, which is also an important
reason for their popularity, is that they are presumed to be very robust, since
they are simple, randomized, and, crucially, do not utilize explicitly the
global structure of the underlying graph. While sporadic results exist, there
has been no systematic theoretical treatment quantifying the robustness of
these models. Here we investigate this question with respect to two orthogonal
aspects: (adversarial) modifications of the underlying graph and message
transmission failures.
  We explore in particular the following notion of Local Resilience: beginning
with a graph, we investigate up to which fraction of the edges an adversary has
to be allowed to delete at each vertex, so that the protocols need
significantly more rounds to broadcast the information. Our main findings
establish a separation among the three models. It turns out that Pull is robust
with respect to all parameters that we consider. On the other hand, Push may
slow down significantly, even if the adversary is allowed to modify the degrees
of the vertices by an arbitrarily small positive fraction only. Finally,
Push&Pull is robust when no message transmission failures are considered,
otherwise it may be slowed down.
  On the technical side, we develop two novel methods for the analysis of
randomized rumour spreading protocols. First, we exploit the notion of
self-bounding functions to facilitate significantly the round-based analysis:
we show that for any graph the variance of the growth of informed vertices is
bounded by its expectation, so that concentration results follow immediately.
Second, in order to control adversarial modifications of the graph we make use
of a powerful tool from extremal graph theory, namely Szemer\`edi's Regularity
Lemma.

multiplexing (NFDM) transmission scheme in the optical fibre communication

single polarisation for data transmission. Employing both polarisations can
potentially double the data rate of NFDM systems. We investigate in simulation
a dual-polarisation NFDM transmission with data modulation on the
$b$-coefficient. First, a transformation that facilitates the dual-polarisation
$b$-modulation was built upon an existing transformation. Second, the $q_c$-
and $b$-modulation for dual-polarisation were compared in terms of Q-factor,
spectral efficiency (SE), and correlation of sub-carriers. The correlation is
quantified via information theoretic metrics, joint and individual entropy. The
polarisation-multiplexed $b$-modulation system shows 1 dB Q-factor improvement
over $q_c$-modulation system due to a weaker correlation of sub-carriers and
less effective noise. Finally, the $b$-modulation system was optimised for high

devices directly harnessing spin- and polarization as information carriers.
Atomically thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides provide a new
material platform which promises intrinsic spin-valley Hall features both for
free carriers, two-particle excitations (excitons), as well as for photons. In
such materials, the spin of an exciton is closely linked to the high-symmetry
point in reciprocal space it emerges from. Here, we demonstrate, that spin, and
hence valley selective propagation is accessible in an atomically thin layer of
MoSe2, which is strongly coupled to a microcavity photon mode. We engineer a
wire-like device, where we can clearly trace the flow, and the helicity of
exciton-polaritons expanding along a channel. By exciting a coherent

expansion of the polariton cloud without neither any applied external magnetic

low-energy neutrino-nucleon ($\nu N$) interactions are of fundamental
importance in nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics as well as new physics
beyond the standard model (SM) but largely uncertain currently, and the
coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) provides a clean way
to extract their information. New physics beyond the SM may cause effectively a
shift of the SM weak mixing angle $\theta_W$ in low-energy $\nu N$
interactions, leading to an effective weak mixing angle $\theta^*_W$. By
analyzing the CE$\nu$NS data of the COHERENT experiment, we find that while a
one-parameter fit to the COHERENT data by varying $\Delta R_{np}$ produces
$\Delta R^{\rm{CsI}}_{np} \simeq 0.68^{+0.91}_{-1.13}$ fm for CsI with an
unrealistically large central value by fixing $\sin^2 \theta^*_W$ at the
low-energy SM value of $\sin^2\theta_W^{\rm{SM}} = 0.23857$, a two-dimensional
fit by varying $\Delta R_{np}$ and $\sin^2 \theta^*_W$ leads to a strong
positive correlation between $\Delta R_{np}$ and $\sin^2 \theta^*_W$ with
significantly smaller central values of $\Delta R^{\rm {CsI}}_{np} \simeq
0.24_{-2.03}^{+2.30}$ fm and $\sin^2 \theta^*_W = 0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.13}$.
Although the uncertainty is too large to claim a determination of $\Delta
R^{\rm{CsI}}_{np}$ and $\sin^2 \theta^*_W$, the present study suggests that the
multi-dimensional fit is important in future analyses of high-precision
CE$\nu$NS data. The implication of the possible deviation of $\sin^2

also discussed.

the geometrical spectrometer parameters foil thickness, distance from a foil to
the first detector and distance between the two detectors using a
multi-objective optimisation, a.k.a Pareto plot analysis. Moreover, the
influence of detector segmentation on spectrometer energy resolution and
efficiency was investigated. The code also produced response functions for the
two selected spectrometer configurations. The SPEC code was used to simulate
the spectrometer's performance in determining the fuel ion temperature and fuel
ion density ratio n_t/n_d. The results presented include the selected
spectrometer configuration with calculated energy resolution and efficiency.
For a selected spectrometer resolution of 5% a maximum efficiency of around
0.003% was achieved. Moreover, the detector segmentation allows for a 20%
increase in spectrometer efficiency for an energy resolution of 4.3%. The ITER
requirements for a 20% accuracy on the n_t/n_d ratio determination and 10% on
the temperature determination within a 100ms sampling window can be achieved
using a combination of several TPR's of same type, in order to boost
efficiency.

unknown people are hard to assess. This may lead to various issues such as the
spread of `fake news' from untrustworthy sources. In sociology the sum of
(social) resources available to a person through their social network is often
described as social capital. In this article, we look at social capital from a
different angle. Instead of evaluating the advantage that people have because
of their membership in a certain group, we investigate various ways to infer
the social capital a person adds or may add to the network, their contributive
social capital (CSC). As there is no consensus in the literature on what the
social capital of a person exactly consists of, we look at various related
properties: expertise, reputation, trustworthiness, and influence. The analysis
of these features is investigated for five different sources of online data:
microblogging (e.g., Twitter), social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook),
direct communication (e.g., email), scientometrics, and threaded discussion
boards (e.g., Reddit). In each field we discuss recent publications and put a
focus on the data sources used, the algorithms implemented, and the performance
evaluation. The findings are compared and set in context to contributive social
capital extraction. The analysis algorithms are based on individual features
(e.g., followers on Twitter), ratios thereof, or a person's centrality measures
(e.g., PageRank). The machine learning approaches, such as straightforward
classifiers (e.g., support vector machines) use ground truths that are
connected to social capital. The discussion of these methods is intended to
facilitate research on the topic by identifying relevant data sources and the
best suited algorithms, and by providing tested methods for the evaluation of
findings.

unique laboratory to characterize the properties of young planetary systems at

resolution of about 70 mas (~8 au). We derive an upper limit on circumplanetary

structured circumstellar disk in both dust and gas. The outer dust ring peaks
at ~0.65"" (74 au) and reveals a possible second unresolved peak at ~0.53"" (60
au). The integrated intensity of CO also shows evidence of a depletion of
emission at ~0.2"" (23 au) with a width of ~0.1"" (11 au). The gas kinematics
show evidence of a deviation from Keplerian rotation inside $\lesssim$0.8"" (91
au). This implies a pressure gradient that can account for the location of the
dust ring well beyond the location of PDS 70b. Further in, we detect an inner
disk which appears to be connected to the outer disk by a possible bridge
feature in the North-West region in both gas and dust. We compare the
observations to hydrodynamical simulations including a planet with different
masses covering the estimated mass range previously derived from NIR photometry

not be sufficient to explain the extent of the wide gap and an additional
low-mass companion may be needed to account for the observed disk morphology.

triangular spin structure, which allows control of the Hall current with

be associated with partial gapping of the Fermi surfaces that comes from

amount of trapped electrons and the gate voltage. We find that the trapped
electrons follow an exponentially decaying spatial distribution away from the
interface. However, contrary to earlier observations, we find that the Fermi
level remains well within the quantum well. The enhanced trapping of electrons
induced by the gate voltage can therefore not be explained by a thermal escape
mechanism. Further gate sweeping experiments strengthen our conclusion that the
thermal escape mechanism is not valid. We propose a new mechanism which
involves the electromigration and clustering of oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3. Our

quantitative approaches for investigating timing exist to date. Here, we
propose a novel approach for quantitatively comparing timing in animal
vocalisations in terms of the typical ICIs. As features, we use the
distribution of silence gaps parametrised with a kernel density estimate (KDE)
and compare the distributions with the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence
(sKL-divergence). We use this technique to compare timing in vocalisations of
two frog species, a group of zebra finches and calls from parrots of the same
species. As a main finding, we demonstrate that in our dataset, closely related
species have more similar distributions than species genetically more distant,
with sKL-divergences across-species larger than within-species distances.
Compared with more standard methods such as Fourier analysis, the proposed
method is more robust to different durations present in the data samples,
flexibly applicable to different species and easy to interpret. Investigating
timing in animal vocalisations may thus contribute to taxonomy, support
conservation efforts by helping monitoring animals in the wild and may shed
light onto the origins of timing structures in animal vocal communication.

feedback effects at both levels using the same model? We answer this question
by combining Predictive Coding (PC) and Sparse Coding (SC) into a hierarchical
and convolutional framework. In this Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC)
model, the SC component models the internal recurrent processing within each
layer, and the PC component describes the interactions between layers using
feedforward and feedback connections. Here, we train a 2-layered SDPC on two
different databases of images, and we interpret it as a model of the early

converged, SDPC exhibits oriented and localized receptive fields in V1 and more
complex features in V2. Second, we analyze the effects of feedback on the
neural organization beyond the classical receptive field of V1 neurons using
interaction maps. These maps are similar to association fields and reflect the
Gestalt principle of good continuation. We demonstrate that feedback signals
reorganize interaction maps and modulate neural activity to promote contour
integration. Third, we demonstrate at the representational level that the SDPC
feedback connections are able to overcome noise in input images. Therefore, the
SDPC captures the association field principle at the neural level which results
in better disambiguation of blurred images at the representational level.

recent reformulation of the breakage mechanics theory. Compared with previous
breakage mechanics-based models, the proposed model is improved to capture
strain softening towards the critical state following the peak stress observed
in dense specimens under shearing, and simultaneous evolution of breakage and
dilation. Considering the competition between dilation and particle breakage
allows the model to capture breakage-induced reduction in dilatancy and peak
strength as confining pressure increases. The influence of the model parameters
on the overall material response is described through a detailed calibration
procedure based on a benchmark experimental dataset. Comparison of the results
of drained triaxial compression experiments on two sands with the predictions
of the model indicates that the enriched model successfully captures strain
softening in dilatant specimens, the shearing-driven evolution of stress-strain
behavior towards the critical state at different confinement levels, the
transition from dilatant to compactive volumetric response, and the evolution
of particle grading due to distributed breakage events. The proposed framework
is capable of qualitatively reproducing the experimentally observed
stress-dilatancy-breakage relationship in brittle granular materials in the low
pressure regime.

future costs arising from a given control policy, when the initial state and
input are given. Although some of their properties are understood, Q-functions
generating optimal policies for continuous problems are usually hard to
compute. Even when a system model is available, optimal control is generally
difficult to achieve except in rare cases where an analytical solution happens
to exist, or an explicit exact solution can be computed. It is typically
necessary to discretize the state and action spaces, or parameterize the
Q-function with a basis that can be hard to select a priori. This paper
describes a model-based algorithm based on generalized Benders theory that
yields ever-tighter outer-approximations of the optimal Q-function. Under a
strong duality assumption, we prove that the algorithm yields an arbitrarily
small Bellman optimality error at any finite number of arbitrary points in the
state-input space, in finite iterations. Under additional assumptions, the same
guarantee holds when the inputs are determined online by the algorithm's
updating Q-function. We demonstrate these properties numerically on scalar and
8-dimensional systems.

radiative-convective model and a 2-D Mantle Dynamics model) to explore the
environmental effects of very large impacts on the atmosphere, surface and
interior of early Mars.
  Using a combination of 1-D and 3-D climate simulations, we show that the
environmental effects of the largest impact events recorded on Mars are
characterized by: (i) a short impact-induced warm period; (ii) a low amount of
hydrological cycling of water; (iii) deluge-style precipitation; and (iv)
precipitation patterns that are uncorrelated with the observed regions of
valley networks. We show that the impact-induced stable runaway greenhouse
state predicted by Segura et al. 2012 is physically inconsistent. We confirm
the results of Segura et al. 2008 and Urata & Toon 2013 that water ice clouds
can significantly extend the duration of the post-impact warm period, and even
for cloud coverage lower than predicted in Ramirez & Kasting 2017. However, the
range of cloud microphysical properties for which this scenario works is very
narrow.
  Using 2-D Mantle Dynamics simulations we find that large impacts can raise
the near-surface internal heat flux up to several hundreds of mW/m$^2$ (i.e. up
to $\sim$ 10 times the ambient flux) for several millions years at the edges of
the impact crater. However, such internal heat flux is insufficient to keep the
martian surface above the melting point of water.
  Our numerical results support the prediction of Palumbo & Head 2018 that very
large impact-induced rainfall could have caused degradation of craters and
formed smooth plains, potentially erasing much of the previously visible
morphological surface history. Such hot rainfalls may have also led to the
formation of aqueous alteration products on Noachian-aged terrains.

(MIMO) transmitter architectures for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications
which comprise few active antennas, each equipped with a dedicated radio
frequency (RF) chain, that illuminate a nearby large intelligent
reflecting/transmitting surface (IRS/ITS). The IRS (ITS) consists of a large
number of low-cost and energy-efficient passive antenna elements which are able
to reflect (transmit) a phase-shifted version of the incident electromagnetic
field. Similar to lens array (LA) antennas, IRS/ITS-aided antenna architectures
are energy efficient due to the almost lossless over-the-air connection between
the active antennas and the intelligent surface. However, unlike for LA
antennas, for which the number of active antennas has to linearly grow with the
number of passive elements (i.e., the lens aperture) due to the
non-reconfigurablility (i.e., non-intelligence) of the lens, for IRS/ITS-aided
antennas, the reconfigurablility of the IRS/ITS facilitates scaling up the
number of radiating passive elements without increasing the number of costly
and bulky active antennas. We show that the constraints that the precoders for
IRS/ITS-aided antennas have to meet differ from those of conventional MIMO
architectures. Taking these constraints into account and exploiting the
sparsity of mmWave channels, we design two efficient precoders; one based on
maximizing the mutual information and one based on approximating the optimal
unconstrained fully digital (FD) precoder via the orthogonal matching pursuit
algorithm. Furthermore, we develop a power consumption model for IRS/ITS-aided
antennas that takes into account the impacts of the IRS/ITS imperfections,
namely the spillover loss, taper loss, aperture loss, and phase shifter loss.

optimization problems with a simple (possibly non-smooth) regularizer in

non-asymptotic convergence analysis of SPG exists for non-convex optimization
with a non-smooth and non-convex regularizer. All existing non-asymptotic
analysis of SPG for solving non-smooth non-convex problems require the
non-smooth regularizer to be a convex function, and hence are not applicable to
a non-smooth non-convex regularized problem. This work initiates the analysis
to bridge this gap and opens the door to non-asymptotic convergence analysis of
non-smooth non-convex regularized problems. We analyze several variants of
mini-batch SPG methods for minimizing a non-convex objective that consists of a
smooth non-convex loss and a non-smooth non-convex regularizer. Our
contributions are two-fold: (i) we show that they enjoy the same complexities
as their counterparts for solving convex regularized non-convex problems in
terms of finding an approximate stationary point; (ii) we develop more
practical variants using dynamic mini-batch size instead of a fixed mini-batch
size without requiring the target accuracy level of solution. The significance
of our results is that they improve upon the-state-of-art results for solving
non-smooth non-convex regularized problems. We also empirically demonstrate the
effectiveness of the considered SPG methods in comparison with other peer

for achieving low latency and high reliability. A natural design choice to
maximize reliability and minimize retransmission is to select the lowest
allowed target error rate. However, the overall latency is the sum of queueing
latency and retransmission latency, hence choosing the lowest target error rate
does not always minimize the overall latency. In this paper, we minimize the
overall latency by jointly designing the target error rate and transmission
rate adaptation, which leads to a fundamental tradeoff point between queueing
and retransmission latency. This design problem can be formulated as a Markov
decision process, which is theoretically optimal, but its complexity is
prohibitively high for real-system deployments. We managed to develop a
low-complexity closed-form policy named Large-arraY Reliability and Rate
Control (LYRRC), which is proven to be asymptotically latency-optimal as the
number of antennas increases. In LYRRC, the transmission rate is twice of the
arrival rate, and the target error rate is a function of the antenna number,
arrival rate, and channel estimation error. With simulated and measured
channels, our evaluations find LYRRC satisfies the latency and reliability
requirements of URLLC in all the tested scenarios.

the public consciousness. But how to make sense of the ever-increasing volume
of big social data so that we can better understand and improve the user
experience in increasingly complex, data-driven digital systems. This link with
usability and the user experience of data-driven system bridges into the wider
field of HCI, attracting interdisciplinary researchers as we see the demand for
consumer technologies, software and systems, as well as the integration of
social networks into our everyday lives. The fact that the data largely posted
on social networks tends to be textual, provides a further link to linguistics,
psychology and psycholinguistics to better understand the relationship between
human behaviours offline and online.
  In this thesis, we present a novel conceptual framework based on a complex
digital system using collected longitudinal datasets to predict system status
based on the personality traits and emotions extracted from text posted by
users. The system framework was built using a dataset collected from an online
scholarship system in which 2000 students had their digital behaviour and
social network behaviour collected for this study. We contextualise this
research project with a wider review and critical analysis of the current
psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction
literature, which reveals a gap of mapping and understanding digital profiling
against system status.

hybrid computation, inspired by the fine-grain call-by-value paradigm, and
equip it with a denotational and computationally adequate denotational

knowledge-based analytical method using deep convolutional neural network (CNN)

demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating quantitative clinical
measurements to assist CNNs in all-cause mortality prediction from chest LDCT

an important complement to CNNs to achieve a more comprehensive feature

framed in terms of causal models, where adjusting for patient case-mix is
analogous to controlling for confounding, and exposure is being treated in a
given hospital, for instance. Our goal here is to help identifying good QIs
rather than comparing hospitals in terms of an already chosen QI, and so we
focus on the presence and magnitude of overall variation in care between the
hospitals rather than the pairwise differences between any two hospitals. We
consider how the observed variation in care received at patient level can be
decomposed into that causally explained by the hospital performance adjusting
for the case-mix, the case-mix itself, and residual variation. For this
purpose, we derive a three-way variance decomposition, with particular
attention to its causal interpretation in terms of potential outcome variables.
We propose model-based estimators for the decomposition, accommodating
different link functions and either fixed or random effect models. We evaluate
their performance in a simulation study and demonstrate their use in a real

entries of a large low-rank matrix, the goal is to estimate the underlying
matrix faithfully and efficiently. Arguably one of the most popular paradigms
to tackle this problem is convex relaxation, which achieves remarkable efficacy
in practice. However, the theoretical support of this approach is still far
from optimal in the noisy setting, falling short of explaining its empirical
success.
  We make progress towards demystifying the practical efficacy of convex
relaxation vis-\`a-vis random noise. When the rank and the condition number of
the unknown matrix are bounded by a constant, we demonstrate that the convex
programming approach achieves near-optimal estimation errors --- in terms of
the Euclidean loss, the entrywise loss, and the spectral norm loss --- for a
wide range of noise levels. All of this is enabled by bridging convex
relaxation with the nonconvex Burer-Monteiro approach, a seemingly distinct
algorithmic paradigm that is provably robust against noise. More specifically,
we show that an approximate critical point of the nonconvex formulation serves
as an extremely tight approximation of the convex solution, thus allowing us to
transfer the desired statistical guarantees of the nonconvex approach to its
convex counterpart.

complexity of evaluating functions with distributed inputs. But does the type

question because in several other settings maximally entangled states are known
to be less useful as a resource than some partially entangled state. These
include non-local games, tasks with quantum communication between players and
referee, and simulating bipartite unitaries or communication channels. By
contrast, we prove that the bounded-error entanglement-assisted quantum
communication complexity of a function cannot be improved by more than a
constant factor by replacing maximally entangled states with arbitrary
entangled states. In particular, we show that every quantum communication
protocol using $Q$ qubits of communication and arbitrary shared entanglement
can be $\epsilon$-approximated by a protocol using
$O(Q/\epsilon+\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon)$ qubits of communication and only EPR
pairs as shared entanglement.
  Our second result concerns an old question in quantum information theory: How
much quantum communication is required to approximately convert one pure
bipartite entangled state into another? We show that the communication cost of
converting between two bipartite quantum states is upper bounded, up to a
constant multiplicative factor, by a natural and efficiently computable
quantity which we call the $\ell_{\infty}$-Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between
those two states. Furthermore, we prove a complementary lower bound on the cost
of state conversion by the $\epsilon$-smoothed $\ell_{\infty}$-EMD, which is a
natural smoothing of the $\ell_{\infty}$-EMD that we will define via a
connection with optimal transport theory.

The class of relations (i.e. jointly monomorphic spans) characterizes Mal'tsev

spans) characterizes weakly Mal'tsev categories. The result is based on the
uniqueness of internal categorical structures such as internal category and
internal groupoid (Lawvere condition). The uniqueness of these structures is
viewed as a property on their underlying reflexive graphs, restricted to the
classifying spans. The class of classifying spans is combined, via a new
compatibility condition, with split squares. This is analogous to orthogonality
between spans and cospans. The result is a general classifying scheme which
covers the main characterizations for Mal'tsev like categories. The class of

state-of-the-art radiation-hydrodynamic simulations from the Cosmic
Reionization On Computers series to predict the number of transmission spikes

resolution and in a realistic observational setting. Transmission spikes are
produced in highly-ionized underdense regions located in the vicinity of UV

of the quasar ULAS J1120+0641 in about 15% of the realizations. The spike
height correlates with both the gas density and the ionized fraction, but the
former link is erased when synthetic spectra are smoothed to realistically
achievable spectral resolutions. There exists a linear relationship between
spike width and the extent of the associated underdense region, with a slope
that is redshift-dependent. In agreement with observations, the spike
transmitted flux is suppressed at small distance from bright galaxies as these
reside in overdense regions. We argue that this anti-correlation can be used to
constrain large-scale density modes.

of these two important principles. If a logical quantum system is encoded into
$n$ physical subsystems, we say that the code is covariant with respect to a
symmetry group $G$ if a $G$ transformation on the logical system can be
realized by performing transformations on the individual subsystems. For a
$G$-covariant code with $G$ a continuous group, we derive a lower bound on the
error correction infidelity following erasure of a subsystem. This bound
approaches zero when the number of subsystems $n$ or the dimension $d$ of each
subsystem is large. We exhibit codes achieving approximately the same scaling
of infidelity with $n$ or $d$ as the lower bound. Leveraging tools from
representation theory, we prove an approximate version of the Eastin-Knill
theorem: If a code admits a universal set of transversal gates and corrects
erasure with fixed accuracy, then, for each logical qubit, we need a number of
physical qubits per subsystem that is inversely proportional to the error
parameter. We construct codes covariant with respect to the full logical
unitary group, achieving good accuracy for large $d$ (using random codes) or
$n$ (using codes based on $W$-states). We systematically construct codes
covariant with respect to general groups, obtaining natural generalizations of
qubit codes to, for instance, oscillators and rotors. In the context of the
AdS/CFT correspondence, our approach provides insight into how time evolution

in this era of gravitational-wave detection from binary black hole (BBH) and
binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Here we present new developments in the
N-body evolution program NBODY7 in regards to its stellar-remnant formation and
related schemes. We demonstrate that the newly-implemented stellar-wind and
remnant-formation schemes in the NBODY7 code's BSE sector, such as the 'rapid'

pulsational-pair-instability and pair-instability supernova (PPSN/PSN), now
produces neutron star (NS) and BH masses that agree nearly perfectly, over
large ranges of zero-age-main sequence (ZAMS) mass and metallicity, with those
from the StarTrack population-synthesis program. We also demonstrate the new
implementations of various natal-kick mechanisms on NSs and BHs such as the
'convection-asymmetry-driven', 'collapse-asymmetry-driven', and
'neutrino-emission-driven' kicks, in addition to a fully consistent
implementation of the standard, fallback-dependent, momentum-conserving natal
kick. We find that the SN material fallback causes the convection-asymmetry
kick to effectively retain similar number and mass of BHs in clusters as for
the standard, momentum-conserving kick. The collapse-asymmetry kick would cause
nearly all BHs to retain in clusters irrespective of remnant formation model
and metallicity, whereas the inference of a large number of BHs in GCs would
potentially rule out the neutrino-driven kick mechanism. Pre-SN mergers of
massive primordial binaries would cause BH masses to deviate from the
single-star ZAMS mass-remnant mass relation. Such mergers, at low
metallicities, can produce low-spinning BHs within the PSN mass gap that can be
retained in a stellar cluster.

Einstein-Maxwell-scalar models, wherein the scalar field is, generically,
non-minimally coupled to the Maxwell field via a scalar function $f(\Phi)$.
Firstly, a trivial Maxwell field is considered, which yields a consistent
truncation of the full model. In this case, using a scaling (Derrick-type)
argument, it is established that no stationary and axisymmetric
self-gravitating scalar solitons exist, unless the scalar potential energy is
somewhere negative in spacetime. This generalises previous results for the
static and strictly stationary cases. Thus, rotation alone cannot support
self-gravitating scalar solitons in this class of models. Secondly, constant
sign couplings are considered. Generalising a previous argument by Heusler for
electro-vacuum, it is established that no static self-gravitating
electromagnetic-scalar solitons exist. Thus, a varying (but constant sign)
electric permittivity alone cannot support static Einstein-Maxwell-scalar
solitons. Finally, the second result is generalised for strictly stationary,
but not necessarily static, spacetimes, using a Lichnerowicz-type argument,
generalising previous results in models where the scalar and Maxwell fields are
not directly coupled. The scope of validity of each of these results points out
the possible paths to circumvent them, in order to obtain self-gravitating
solitons in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar models.

not, however, rule out the possibility of a non-detection due to our limited

Eastin and Knill, which states that if local errors are correctable, the group
of transversal gates must be of finite order. We are able to do this by
introducing a small error on the decoding procedure that decreases with the
dimension of the frames used. Furthermore, we show that there is a direct
relationship between how small this error can be and how accurate quantum

no-go theorem would be violated if time could be measured perfectly in quantum

errors at unknown locations, and we show how to achieve this by simple majority

which arises at four-loop level and is a firm prediction of the theory. Physics
below $v'$, including the mass and interaction of $e'$ dark matter, is
described by $\textit{one fewer parameter}$ than in the Standard Model. The
allowed range of $m_{e'}$ is determined by uncertainties in $(\alpha_s, m_t,
m_h)$, so that future precision measurements of these will be correlated with
the direct detection rate of $e'$ dark matter, which, together with the neutron
electric dipole moment, will probe the entire parameter space.

[L(1.4GHz)/(W/Hz)]=23.3-24.4). These targets were selected to have known
ionized outflows based on broad [OIII] emission-line components (FWHM~800-1800
km/s). Although `radio-quiet' and not `radio AGN' by many traditional criteria,
we show that for nine of the targets, star formation likely accounts for <~10
per cent of the radio emission. We find that ~80-90 per cent of these nine
targets exhibit extended radio structures on 1-25 kpc scales. The quasars'
radio morphologies, spectral indices and position on the radio size-luminosity
relationship reveals that these sources are consistent with being low power
compact radio galaxies. Therefore, we favour radio jets as dominating the radio
emission in the majority of these quasars. The radio jets we observe are
associated with morphologically and kinematically distinct features in the
ionized gas, such as increased turbulence and outflowing bubbles, revealing
jet-gas interaction on galactic scales. Importantly, such conclusions could not
have been drawn from current low-resolution radio surveys such as FIRST. Our
observations support a scenario where compact radio jets, with modest radio
luminosities, are a crucial feedback mechanism for massive galaxies during a
quasar phase.

the detailed characterization of transiting terrestrial planets, and the search
for Earth analog planets to be targeted by future imaging missions. Both of
these pursuits are dependent on an order-of-magnitude improvement in the
measurement of stellar radial velocities (RV), setting a requirement on
single-measurement instrumental uncertainty of order 10 cm/s. Achieving such
extraordinary precision on a high-resolution spectrometer requires
thermo-mechanically stabilizing the instrument to unprecedented levels. Here,
we describe the Environment Control System (ECS) of the NEID Spectrometer,
which will be commissioned on the 3.5 m WIYN Telescope at Kitt Peak National
Observatory in 2019, and has a performance specification of on-sky RV precision
< 50 cm/s. Because NEID's optical table and mounts are made from aluminum,
which has a high coefficient of thermal expansion, sub-milliKelvin temperature
control is especially critical. NEID inherits its ECS from that of the
Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF), but with modifications for improved
performance and operation near room temperature. Our full-system stability test
shows the NEID system exceeds the already impressive performance of HPF,
maintaining vacuum pressures below $10^{-6}$ Torr and an RMS temperature
stability better than 0.4 mK over 30 days. Our ECS design is fully open-source;
the design of our temperature-controlled vacuum chamber has already been made
public, and here we release the electrical schematics for our custom
Temperature Monitoring and Control (TMC) system.

layer gets fragmented into a dynamic chain of plasmoids which undergo
successive coalescence. Mergers of sufficiently large plasmoids produce
secondary perpendicular current sheets, which are also plasmoid-unstable.
Collisions of plasmoids with each other and with the upstream magnetic field
eject fast-magnetosonic waves, which propagate upstream across the background

fall in the radio band. This model successfully explains many important

with the POL-2 instrument on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) as part
of the JCMT B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We
detect an ordered magnetic field projected on the plane of sky in the starless

northeast-southwest orientation centering between $\sim$40$^\circ$ to
$\sim$100$^\circ$, indicating that the field in the core is well aligned with
the magnetic field in lower-density regions of the cloud probed by
near-infrared observations and also the cloud-scale magnetic field traced by
Planck observations. The polarization percentage ($P$) decreases with an
increasing total intensity ($I$) with a power-law index of $-$1.03 $\pm$ 0.05.
We estimate the plane-of-sky field strength ($B_{\mathrm{pos}}$) using modified
Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) methods based on structure function (SF),

magnetic energy calculated from the SF method is comparable to the turbulent
energy in Ophiuchus C, while the ACF method and the UM method only set upper

levels of description, from the Euler-Lagrange propagation of structureless
classical particles to unitary Schr\""odinger propagation of an electron-hole
wave packet in a mean field and to the full quantum propagation of the
two-particle complex. A recently proposed beyond mean-field self-energy
approach, adding internal virtual transitions to the c.m. dynamics, has been
generalized to time-dependent potentials and turns out to describe very well
full quantum calculations, while being orders of magnitude numerically less
demanding. We show that SAW-driven SIXs are a sensitive probe of scattering
potentials in the devices originating, for example, from single impurities or
metallic gates, due to competing length and energy scales between the SAW
elastic potential, the scattering potential, and the internal electron-hole
dynamic of the SIX. Comparison between different approximations allow us to
show that internal correlation of the electron-hole pair is crucial in
scattering from shallow impurities, where tunneling plays a major role. On the
other hand, scattering from broad potentials, i.e., with length scales
exceeding the SIX Bohr radius, is well described as the classical dynamics of a
pointlike SIX. Recent experiments are discussed in light of our calculations.

that NO$_{X}^{-}$ is unstable in the reducing environment of early Earth. Sinks
due to UV photolysis and reactions with reduced iron (Fe$^{2+}$) suppress
[NO$_{X}^{-}$] by several orders of magnitude relative to past predictions. For

investigate the problem of grounding language commands as reward functions
using inverse reinforcement learning, and argue that language-conditioned
rewards are more transferable than language-conditioned policies to new
environments. We propose language-conditioned reward learning (LC-RL), which
grounds language commands as a reward function represented by a deep neural
network. We demonstrate that our model learns rewards that transfer to novel
tasks and environments on realistic, high-dimensional visual environments with
natural language commands, whereas directly learning a language-conditioned
policy leads to poor performance.

which neutron elastic scattering off of hydrogen is used to kinematically
reconstruct the source direction and energy of an incoming neutron. For this
application, interaction position resolutions of about 10 mm and timing
resolutions of about 1 ns are necessary to achieve the desired efficiency for

we also explore the systematic variability of the position resolution, and show
that, in general, using the difference in the pulse arrival time at the two
ends is less susceptible to systematic variation than using the log ratio of
the charge amplitude of the two ends. Finally, we measure a bias in the
absolute time of interactions as a function of position along the bar: the
measured interaction time for events at the center of the bar is $\sim$100 ps
later than interactions near the SiPM.

equal to the rate of destruction of old craters. Crater counts of multiple
lunar terrains over decades consistently show that the equilibrium cumulative
size-frequency distribution (SFD) per unit area of small craters of radius >r
is proportional r^(-2), and that the total crater density is a few percent of
so-called geometric saturation, which is the maximum theoretical packing
density of circular features. While it has long been known that the primary
crater destruction mechanism for these small craters is steady diffusive
degradation, there are few quantitative constraints on the processes that
determine the degradation rate of meter to kilometer scale lunar surface
features. Here we combine analytical modeling with a Monte Carlo landscape
evolution code known as the Cratered Terrain Evolution Model to place
constraints on which processes control the observed equilibrium size-frequency
distribution for small craters. We find that the impacts by small distal ejecta
fragments, distributed in spatially heterogeneous rays, is the largest
contributor to the diffusive degradation which controls the equilibrium SFD of
small craters. Other degradation or crater removal mechanisms, such cookie
cutting, ejecta burial, seismic shaking, and micrometeoroid bombardment, likely
contribute very little to the diffusive topographic degradation of the lunar

achieving privacy in data analysis, which is typically implemented either in
the ""central"" or ""local"" model. The local model has been more popular for
commercial deployments as it does not require a trusted data collector. This
increased privacy, however, comes at a cost of utility and algorithmic
expressibility as compared to the central model.
  In this work, we propose, Crypt$\epsilon$, a system and programming framework
that (1) achieves the accuracy guarantees and algorithmic expressibility of the
central model (2) without any trusted data collector like in the local model.
Crypt$\epsilon$ achieves the ""best of both worlds"" by employing two
non-colluding untrusted servers that run DP programs on encrypted data from the
data owners. Although straightforward implementations of DP programs using
secure computation tools can achieve the above goal theoretically, in practice
they are beset with many challenges such as poor performance and tricky
security proofs. To this end, Crypt$\epsilon$ allows data analysts to author
logical DP programs that are automatically translated to secure protocols that
work on encrypted data. These protocols ensure that the untrusted servers learn
nothing more than the noisy outputs, thereby guaranteeing DP (for
computationally bounded adversaries) for all Crypt$\epsilon$ programs.
Crypt$\epsilon$ supports a rich class of DP programs that can be expressed via
a small set of transformation and measurement operators followed by arbitrary
post-processing. Further, we propose performance optimizations leveraging the
fact that the output is noisy. We demonstrate Crypt$\epsilon$'s feasibility for
practical DP analysis with extensive empirical evaluations on real datasets.

analyzing the performance of atomic interferometers using atom clouds prepared
in a trap as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) or as a thermal ensemble.
Predictions of the model for dynamic properties such as wave-packet size and
phase are in excellent agreement with explicit numerical solutions of the
non-linear Gross-Pitaevskii equations and enable fast calculations of
interferometric performance in regimes where full numerical solutions become
impractical. As a starting point, the static Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation
for a BEC in a harmonic trap is generalized to the whole range of atom-atom
interaction strengths: from non-interacting atoms (low densities) to the
standard TF limit (high atomic densities, as long as the condensate
approximation still holds). In particular, this generalization allows a good
estimation of atomic cloud properties along the transition from a
three-dimensional to a quasi-one-dimensional BEC in an elongated trap. We then
develop a theoretical model of wave-packet evolution in time-dependent
conditions. The model is applicable for a wide range of dynamical problems
involving evolution in time-dependent potentials and in a changing mean-field
atomic repulsion due to splitting and separation of wave-packets. We use the
model for studying two effects that influence interferometric coherence:
imperfect spatial recombination in a two-state interferometer (the so-called
""Humpty-Dumpty effect"") and phase diffusion due to number uncertainty in the
two interferometer arms, which was previously studied thoroughly only for
interferometric schemes where the BECs in the two arms stay trapped (for
example, in a double-well potential).

restriction and generalize linear elasticity to active media with

This generalized framework, which we dub odd elasticity, reveals that two
additional moduli can exist in a two-dimensional isotropic solid with active
bonds. Such an odd-elastic solid can be regarded as a distributed engine: work
is locally extracted, or injected, during quasi-static cycles of deformation.
Using continuum equations, coarse-grained microscopic models, and numerical

Besides providing insights beyond existing hydrodynamic theories of active

regularization methods, but it is computationally intensive in general. To
lessen its computational burden, approximation schemes such as generalized
approximate cross validation (GACV) are often employed. However, such
approximations may not work well when non-smooth loss functions are involved.
As a case in point, approximate cross validation schemes for penalized quantile
regression do not work well for extreme quantiles. In this paper, we propose a
new algorithm to compute the leave-one-out cross validation scores exactly for
quantile regression with ridge penalty through a case-weight adjusted solution
path. Resorting to the homotopy technique in optimization, we introduce a case
weight for each individual data point as a continuous embedding parameter and
decrease the weight gradually from one to zero to link the estimators based on
the full data and those with a case deleted. This allows us to design a
solution path algorithm to compute all leave-one-out estimators very
efficiently from the full-data solution. We show that the case-weight adjusted
solution path is piecewise linear in the weight parameter, and using the
solution path, we examine case influences comprehensively and observe that
different modes of case influences emerge, depending on the specified
quantiles, data dimensions and penalty parameter.

the field of neutrino physics. One strategy to measure the NMO is to observe
matter effects in the oscillation pattern of atmospheric neutrinos above $\sim
1\,\mathrm{GeV}$, as proposed for several next-generation neutrino experiments.
Moreover, the existing IceCube DeepCore detector can already explore this type
of measurement. We present rthe development and application of two independent
analyses to search for the signature of the NMO with three years of DeepCore
data. These analyses include a full treatment of systematic uncertainties and a
statistically-rigorous method to determine the significance for the NMO from a
fit to the data. Both analyses show that the dataset is fully compatible with
both mass orderings. For the more sensitive analysis, we observe a preference
for Normal Ordering with a $p$-value of $p_\mathrm{IO} = 15.3\%$ and
$\mathrm{CL}_\mathrm{s}=53.3\%$ for the Inverted Ordering hypothesis, while the
experimental results from both analyses are consistent within their
uncertainties. Since the result is independent of the value of
$\delta_\mathrm{CP}$ and obtained from energies $E_\nu \gtrsim
5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, it is complementary to recent results from long-baseline
experiments. These analyses set the groundwork for the future of this
measurement with more capable detectors, such as the IceCube Upgrade and the
proposed PINGU detector.

mixing ratio on Mars using calculations from modelled and measurement data. We
focus on 2 am local time snapshots to eliminate daily effects related to
differences in insolation, and to be able to compare calculations based on
modelling data from the LMDZ GCM with the observations of MGS TES. We study the
seasonal effects by examining four specific dates in the Martian year, the
northern spring equinox, summer solstice, autumn equinox and winter solstice.
We identify three specific zones, where the near-surface relative humidity
levels are systematically higher than in their vicinity regardless of season.
We find that these areas coincide with low thermal inertia features, which
control surface temperatures on the planet, and are most likely covered with
unconsolidated fine dust with grain sizes less than $\sim$ 40$\mu$m. By
comparing the data of relative humidity, temperature and water vapor volume
mixing ratio at two different heights (near-surface, $\sim$ 23 m above the
surface), we demonstrate that the thermal inertia could play an important role
in determining near-surface humidity levels. We also notice that during the
night the water vapor levels drop at $\sim$ 4 m above the surface. This,
together with the temperature and thermal inertia values, shows that water
vapor likely condenses in the near-surface atmosphere and on the ground during
the night at the three aforementioned regions. This condensation may be in the
form of brines, wettening of the fine grains or deliquescence. This study
specifies areas of interest on the surface of present day Mars for the proposed
condensation, which may be examined by in-situ measurements in the future.

Following the Multidimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) (Clain et al.,

approach, a candidate solution is computed at a next time level via a
high-order accurate explicit scheme (Abgrall, Journal of Scientific Computing

so-called detector determines if the candidate solution reveals any spurious
oscillations or numerical issue and, if so, only the troubled cells are locally
recomputed via a more dissipative scheme. This allows to design a family of ""a

accurate, non-oscillatory and effective scheme. Among the detecting criteria of
the novel MOOD strategy, two different approaches from literature, based on the
work of Clain et al. (Journal of Computational Physics 2011), Diot et al.

the aim of building better systems, new countermeasures and stronger attacks

due to the integration of variable Renewable Energy Sources (vRES). In order to
consider these requirements Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) models have
recently incorporated Unit Commitment (UC) constraints, using traditional
energy-based formulations. However, recent studies have shown that energy-based
UC formulations overestimate the actual flexibility of the system. Instead,
power-based UC models overcome these problems by correctly modeling ramping
constraints and operating reserves. This paper proposes a power-based GEP-UC
model that improves the existing models. The proposed model optimizes
investment decisions on vRES, Energy Storage Systems (ESS), and thermal
technologies. In addition, it includes real-time flexibility requirements, and
the flexibility provided by ESS, as well as other UC constraints, e.g., minimum
up/down times, startup and shutdown power trajectories, network constraints.
The results show that power-based model uses the installed investments more
effectively than the energy-based models because it more accurately represents
flexibility capabilities and system requirements. For instance, the power-based
model obtains less investment (6-12%) and yet it uses more efficiently this
investment because operating cost is also lower (2-8%) in a real-time
validation. We also propose a semi-relaxed power-based GEP-UC model, which is
at least 10 times faster than its full-integer version and without
significantly losing accuracy in the results (less than 0.2% error).

Computationally efficient representations of space-time correlations can be

computational load. We formulate a stochastic local interaction model for
regular and scattered space-time data that incorporates interactions within
controlled space-time neighborhoods. The strength of the interaction and the
size of the neighborhood are defined by means of kernel functions and adaptive
local bandwidths. Compactly supported kernels lead to finite-size local
neighborhoods and consequently to sparse precision matrices that admit explicit
expression. Hence, the stochastic local interaction model's requirements for
storage are modest and the costly covariance matrix inversion is not needed. We
also derive a semi-explicit prediction equation and express the conditional
variance of the prediction in terms of the diagonal of the precision matrix.
For data on regular space-time lattices, the stochastic local interaction model
is equivalent to a Gaussian Markov Random Field.

irreducible factors of $f\bmod p^k$ blow up exponentially in number; making it
hard to describe them. Can we count those irreducible factors $\bmod~p^k$ that
remain irreducible mod $p$? These are called {\em basic-irreducible}. A simple

the number of positrons produced by the synchrotron radiation in a Ti6Al4V

public health officials: the disease is highly contagious, yet vaccination
rates are declining precipitously in many localities. Consequently, the risk of
a measles outbreak continues to rise. To improve preparedness, we study
historical measles data both pre- and post-vaccine, and design new methodology
to forecast measles counts with uncertainty quantification. We propose to model
the disease counts as an integer-valued functional time series: measles counts
are a function of time-of-year and time-ordered by year. The counts are modeled
using a negative-binomial distribution conditional on a real-valued latent
process, which accounts for the overdispersion observed in the data. The latent
process is decomposed using an unknown basis expansion, which is learned from
the data, with dynamic basis coefficients. The resulting framework provides
enhanced capability to model complex seasonality, which varies dynamically from
year-to-year, and offers improved multi-month ahead point forecasts and
substantially tighter forecast intervals (with correct coverage) compared to
existing forecasting models. Importantly, the fully Bayesian approach provides
well-calibrated and precise uncertainty quantification for epi-relevent
features, such as the future value and time of the peak measles count in a
given year. An R package is available online.

special case of contextual bandits where the exploration cost varies under
different environmental conditions, such as network load or return variation in

pulling a sub-optimal arm (e.g., trying a suboptimal recommendation).
Therefore, intuitively, we could explore more when the exploration cost is
relatively low and exploit more when the exploration cost is relatively high.
Inspired by this intuition, for opportunistic contextual bandits with Linear
payoffs, we propose an Adaptive Upper-Confidence-Bound algorithm (AdaLinUCB) to
adaptively balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for opportunistic
learning. We prove that AdaLinUCB achieves O((log T)^2) problem-dependent
regret upper bound, which has a smaller coefficient than that of the
traditional LinUCB algorithm. Moreover, based on both synthetic and real-world

the same language. However, ensuring a sound interaction between the static and
dynamic parts can incur significant runtime cost. In this paper, we perform a
detailed performance analysis of the transient gradual typing approach
implemented in Reticulated Python, a gradually typed variant of Python. The
transient approach inserts lightweight checks throughout a program rather than
installing proxies on higher order values. We show that, when running
Reticulated Python and the transient approach on CPython, performance decreases
as programs evolve from dynamic to static types, up to a 6x slowdown compared
to equivalent Python programs.
  To reduce this overhead, we design a static analysis and optimization that
removes redundant runtime checks. The optimization employs a static type
inference algorithm that solves traditional subtyping constraints and also a
new kind of check constraint. We evaluate the resulting performance and find
that for many programs, the efficiency of partially typed programs is close to
their untyped counterparts, removing most of the slowdown of transient checks.
Finally, we measure the efficiency of Reticulated Python programs when running
on PyPy, a tracing JIT. We find that combining PyPy with our type inference
algorithm reduces the overall overhead to zero.

image segment, given a pixel within this segment region. The net receives an
image, a point in the image and a region of interest (RoI ) mask. The net
output is a binary mask of the segment in which the point is located. The
region where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.
Full image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,
region-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single
segmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image
segmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in
the training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)
and non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer
pixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that
covers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky
region, the net returns the region of the sky in the image. This is true even
if no example for sky or person appeared in the training set. The net was
tested and trained on the COCO panoptic dataset and achieved 67% IOU for
segmentation of familiar classes (that were part of the net training set) and
53% IOU for segmentation of unfamiliar classes (that were not included in the
training).

and becomes especially challenging when learning with weak supervision---where
only a limited number of labeled sentences are given and a large number of
unlabeled sentences are available. Most existing work exploits unlabeled data
based on the ideas of self-training (i.e., bootstrapping a model) and
multi-view learning (e.g., ensembling multiple model variants). However, these
methods either suffer from the issue of semantic drift, or do not fully capture
the problem characteristics of relation extraction. In this paper, we leverage
a key insight that retrieving sentences expressing a relation is a dual task of
predicting relation label for a given sentence---two tasks are complementary to
each other and can be optimized jointly for mutual enhancement. To model this
intuition, we propose DualRE, a principled framework that introduces a
retrieval module which is jointly trained with the original relation prediction
module. In this way, high-quality samples selected by retrieval module from
unlabeled data can be used to improve prediction module, and vice versa.

disabling dropout noise in responsibility computation is critical to successful

dramatically affect model performance. We develop an evaluation protocol to
assess both quality and diversity of generations against multiple references,

  Scope of WPTE:
  Rewriting techniques are of great help for studying correctness of program
transformations, translations and evaluation, and the aim of WPTE is to bring
together the researchers working on program transformations, evaluation, and
operationally-based programming language semantics, using rewriting methods, in
order to share the techniques and recent developments and to exchange ideas to
encourage further activation of research in this area. Topics in the scope of
WPTE include the correctness of program transformations, optimisations and
translations; program transformations for proving termination, confluence and
other properties; correctness of evaluation strategies; operational semantics
of programs, operationally-based program equivalences such as contextual
equivalences and bisimulations; cost-models for reasoning about the optimizing
power of transformations and the costs of evaluation; program transformations
for verification and theorem proving purposes; translation, simulation,
equivalence of programs with different formalisms, and evaluation strategies;
program transformations for applying rewriting techniques to programs in
specific programming languages; program transformations for program inversions
and program synthesis; program transformation and evaluation for Haskell and
rewriting.
  Research Paper Selection:
  At the workshop six research papers were presented of which five were
accepted for the postproceedings. Each submission was reviewed by three or four
members of the Program Committee in two to three rounds, one round for workshop
presentation and at most two rounds for publication to the postproceedings.
  The program also included one invited talk by Jean-Pierre Jouannaud (Polytec,
Palaiseau, Grand Paris, France) on a framework for graph rewriting; the
abstract of this talk is included in this volume.

retransmit the previous old measurement such that the receiver can obtain a
more reliable old measurement, or transmit a new but less reliable measurement.
To design the optimal decision, we formulate a new problem to optimize the
sensor's online decision policy, i.e., to retransmit or not, depending on both
the current estimation quality of the remote estimator and the current number
of retransmissions of the sensor, so as to minimize the long-term remote
estimation mean-squared error (MSE). This problem is non-trivial. In
particular, it is not clear what the condition is in terms of the communication
channel quality and the LTI system parameters, to ensure that the long-term
estimation MSE can be bounded. We give a sufficient condition of the existence
of a stationary and deterministic optimal policy that stabilizes the remote
estimation system and minimizes the MSE. Also, we prove that the optimal policy
has a switching structure, and derive a low-complexity suboptimal policy. Our
numerical results show that the proposed optimal policy notably improves the
performance of the remote estimation system compared to the conventional
non-HARQ policy.

systems such as engineering, physical, chemical, biological, and ecological
systems, can be simulated or modeled by the dynamics of memristor circuits. It
has the advantage that we can apply nonlinear circuit theory to analyze the
dynamics of memristor circuits. Applying an external source to these memristor
circuits, they exhibit complex behavior, such as chaos and non-periodic
oscillation. If the memristor circuits have an integral invariant, they can
exhibit quasi-periodic or non-periodic behavior by the sinusoidal forcing.
Their behavior greatly depends on the initial conditions, the parameters, and
the maximum step size of the numerical integration. Furthermore, an overflow is
likely to occur due to the numerical instability in long-time simulations. In
order to generate a non-periodic oscillation, we have to choose the initial
conditions, the parameters, and the maximum step size, carefully. We also show
that we can reconstruct chaotic attractors by using the terminal voltage and
current of the memristor. Furthermore, in many memristor circuits, the active
memristor switches between passive and active modes of operation, depending on
its terminal voltage. We can measure its complexity order by defining the
binary coding for the operation modes. By using this coding, we show that in
the forced memristor Toda lattice equations, the memristor's operation modes
exhibit the higher complexity. Furthermore, in the memristor Chua circuit, the
memristor has the special operation modes.

an accuracy guarantee for our extended framework. Our accuracy guarantee can be
used to inform the selection of the regularization parameter in our framework.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that combines stability

Monte-Carlo methods for estimating the objective function of interest. One of
the challenges in the study is that simulating from exponential twists of the
laws of the summands may be computationally demanding since these transformed
laws may be non-standard and intractable. We consider a setting where the
summands are given as a nonlinear functional of random variables that are more
tractable for importance sampling in that the exponential twists of their
distributions take a simpler form (than that for the original summands). We
also study the closely related problem of estimating buffered probability of
exceedance and provide the first rigorous results that relate the asymptotics
of buffered probability and that of the ordinary probability under a large
deviation scaling. The analogous minimization problem for buffered probability,
under conditions, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem which
makes it more tractable than the original optimization problem. We show that,
under conditions, changes of measures that are asymptotically efficient (under
the large deviation scaling) for estimating ordinary probability are also
asymptotically efficient for estimating the buffered probability of exceedance.
We embed the constructed importance sampling scheme in suitable gradient
descent/ascent algorithms for solving the optimization problems of interest.
Implementation of schemes for some examples is illustrated through

a rich source of information for such characterizations by encoding relations
between concepts as edges in a graph. When two concepts are not directly
connected by an edge, their relationship can still be described in terms of the
paths that connect them. Unfortunately, many of these paths are uninformative
and noisy, which means that the success of applications that use such path
features crucially relies on their ability to select high-quality paths. In
existing applications, this path selection process is based on relatively
simple heuristics. In this paper we instead propose to learn to predict path
quality from crowdsourced human assessments. Since we are interested in a
generic task-independent notion of quality, we simply ask human participants to
rank paths according to their subjective assessment of the paths' naturalness,
without attempting to define naturalness or steering the participants towards
particular indicators of quality. We show that a neural network model trained
on these assessments is able to predict human judgments on unseen paths with
near optimal performance. Most notably, we find that the resulting path
selection method is substantially better than the current heuristic approaches
at identifying meaningful paths.

XPS measurements confirm the oxidation of the originally-prepared samples and
also that the removal of the Ta capping layer is achievable by a few sputtering
cycles. The magnetic field strength dependencies of the spin wave modes with
the variation of the Py film thickness for the samples are studied. We observe
that the presence of the Ta capping layer reduces the precessional frequencies
of the samples while the samples without a Ta capping layer enhance the role of
Py thickness. We also observe that the decay time of spin waves is highly
dependent on the top layer of the samples. The decay time increases with
increasing Py thicknesses for Ta/Py/Ta samples implying that the enhancement of
decay time is caused by the Ta/Py/Ta interfaces. Whereas, for Ta/Py samples the
decay time decreases with increasing Py thickness. The results of this work
extend the knowledge on the magnetization dynamics of Py thin films giving

in recent years because of its high performance on large-scale data and complex
models. As data are distributed from cloud-centric to edge nodes, a big
challenge for distributed machine learning systems is how to handle native and
natural non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data for
training. Previous asynchronous training methods do not have a satisfying
performance on non-IID data because it would result in that the training
process fluctuates greatly which leads to an abnormal convergence. We propose a
gradient scheduling algorithm with partly averaged gradients and global
momentum (GSGM) for non-IID data distributed asynchronous training. Our key
idea is to apply global momentum and local average to the biased gradient after
scheduling, in order to make the training process steady. Experimental results
show that for non-IID data training under the same experimental conditions,
GSGM on popular optimization algorithms can achieve a 20% increase in training
stability with a slight improvement in accuracy on Fashion-Mnist and CIFAR-10
datasets. Meanwhile, when expanding distributed scale on CIFAR-100 dataset that
results in sparse data distribution, GSGM can perform a 37% improvement on
training stability. Moreover, only GSGM can converge well when the number of
computing nodes grows to 30, compared to the state-of-the-art distributed
asynchronous algorithms. At the same time, GSGM is robust to different degrees
of non-IID data.

  with Short-Time Fourier Neural Networks",,,"10.1145/3308558.3313426",,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent advances in deep learning motivate the use of deep neural networks in
Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. These networks are modelled after signal
processing in the human brain, thereby leading to significant advantages at
perceptual tasks such as vision and speech recognition. IoT applications,
however, often measure physical phenomena, where the underlying physics (such
as inertia, wireless signal propagation, or the natural frequency of
oscillation) are fundamentally a function of signal frequencies, offering
better features in the frequency domain. This observation leads to a
fundamental question: For IoT applications, can one develop a new brand of
neural network structures that synthesize features inspired not only by the
biology of human perception but also by the fundamental nature of physics?
Hence, in this paper, instead of using conventional building blocks (e.g.,
convolutional and recurrent layers), we propose a new foundational neural
network building block, the Short-Time Fourier Neural Network (STFNet). It
integrates a widely-used time-frequency analysis method, the Short-Time Fourier
Transform, into data processing to learn features directly in the frequency
domain, where the physics of underlying phenomena leave better foot-prints.
STFNets bring additional flexibility to time-frequency analysis by offering
novel nonlinear learnable operations that are spectral-compatible. Moreover,
STFNets show that transforming signals to a domain that is more connected to
the underlying physics greatly simplifies the learning process. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of STFNets with extensive experiments. STFNets significantly
outperform the state-of-the-art deep learning models in all experiments. A
STFNet, therefore, demonstrates superior capability as the fundamental building
block of deep neural networks for IoT applications for various sensor inputs.

Transfer (SWIPT) network, the transmitter sends information to the Information
Receivers (IRs) and energy to Energy Receivers (ERs) concurrently. A
conventional approach is based on Multi-User Linear Precoding (MU--LP) where
each IR directly decodes the intended stream by fully treating the interference
from other IRs and ERs as noise. In this paper, we investigate the application
of linearly-precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) in Multiple Input Single Output (MISO)
SWIPT Broadcast Channel (BC). By splitting the messages of IRs into private and
common parts and encoding the common parts into a common stream decoded by all
IRs, RS manages the interference dynamically. The precoders are designed such
that the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) of IRs is maximized under the total transmit
power constraint and the sum energy constraint for ERs. Numerical results show
that the proposed RS-assisted strategy provides a better rate-energy tradeoff
in MISO SWIPT BC. Under a sum energy constraint of ERs, RS-assisted strategy
achieves better WSR performance of IRs than MU--LP and NOMA in a wide range of
IR and ER deployments. Hence, we draw the conclusion that RS is superior for
downlink SWIPT networks.

access (NOMA) over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in cooperative
communication networks. In this paper, we propose a novel half-duplex
cooperative asynchronous NOMA (C-ANOMA) framework with user relaying, where a
timing mismatch is intentionally added in the broadcast signal. We derive the
expressions for the individual throughputs of the strong user (acts as relay)
which employs the block-wise successive interference cancellation (SIC) and the
weak user which combines the symbol-asynchronous signal with the
interference-free signal. We analytically prove that in the C-ANOMA systems
with a sufficiently large frame length, the strong user attains the same
throughput to decode its own message while both users can achieve a higher
throughput to decode the weak user's message compared with those in the
cooperative NOMA (C-NOMA) systems. Besides, we obtain the optimal timing
mismatch when the frame length goes to infinity. Furthermore, to exploit the
trade-off between the power consumption of base station and that of the relay
user, we solve a weighted sum power minimization problem under quality of
services (QoS) constraints. Numerical results show that the C-ANOMA system can
consume less power compared with the C-NOMA system to satisfy the same QoS
requirements.

used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, where the
measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all
separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality,
due to the exponentially increasing the Hilbert-space dimension with respective
to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient
entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $N$-partite
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme
requires $N+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white
noise. As a comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only
needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise.
There is a trade-off between the realization efficiency, the number of
measurement settings, and the detection robustness, the maximally tolerable
white noise. In this work, we study this trade-off by proposing a family of
entanglement witnesses with $k$ ($2\le k\le N+1$) local measurement settings.
Considering symmetric local measurements, we calculate the maximal tolerable
noise for any given number of measurement settings. Consequently, we design the
optimal witness with a minimal number of settings for any given level of white
noise. Our theoretical analysis can be applied to other multipartite entangled
states with a strong symmetry. Our witnesses can be easily implemented in
experiment and applied in practical multipartite entanglement detection under
different noise conditions.

space. We say that a measure $\mu$ on the space of infinite bit sequences is ML
absolutely continuous if the non-ML-random bit sequences form a null set with
respect to~$\mu$. We think of this as a weak randomness notion for measures.
  We begin with examples, and provide a robustness property related to Solovay
tests. Our main work connects our weak randomness notion to the growth of the
initial segment complexity for measures~$\mu$; the latter is defined as a
$\mu$-average over the complexity of strings of the same length. We show that a
maximal growth implies our weak randomness property, but also that both
implications of the Levin-Schnorr theorem fail. We discuss $C$-triviality and
$K$-triviality for measures and relate these two notions with each other. Here
triviality means that the growth of initial segment complexity is as slow as
possible.
  We show that full Martin-L\""of randomness of a measure implies ML absolute
continuity; the converse fails because only the latter property is compatible
with having atoms. In a final section we consider weak randomness relative to a
general ergodic computable measure. We seek appropriate effective versions of
the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem and the Brudno theorem where the bit
sequences are replaced by measures. We conclude with several open questions.

applications. Whole heart segmentation (WHS), which delineates substructures of
the heart, can be very valuable for modeling and analysis of the anatomy and
functions of the heart. However, automating this segmentation can be arduous
due to the large variation of the heart shape, and different image qualities of
the clinical data. To achieve this goal, a set of training data is generally
needed for constructing priors or for training. In addition, it is difficult to
perform comparisons between different methods, largely due to differences in
the datasets and evaluation metrics used. This manuscript presents the
methodologies and evaluation results for the WHS algorithms selected from the
submissions to the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) challenge,
in conjunction with MICCAI 2017. The challenge provides 120 three-dimensional
cardiac images covering the whole heart, including 60 CT and 60 MRI volumes,
all acquired in clinical environments with manual delineation. Ten algorithms
for CT data and eleven algorithms for MRI data, submitted from twelve groups,
have been evaluated. The results show that many of the deep learning (DL) based
methods achieved high accuracy, even though the number of training datasets was
limited. A number of them also reported poor results in the blinded evaluation,
probably due to overfitting in their training. The conventional algorithms,
mainly based on multi-atlas segmentation, demonstrated robust and stable
performance, even though the accuracy is not as good as the best DL method in
CT segmentation. The challenge, including the provision of the annotated
training data and the blinded evaluation for submitted algorithms on the test

variationally. The exact doubly-degenerate ground state energy has been derived

form of dispersion relations of three different antikink states is obtained and
their validity in the parameter space is discussed. The value of spin-gap,

type of magnetic logic gate based upon asymmetric vortex transistor by using
micromagnetic simulation. Depending upon two main features (topology) of
magnetic vortex, chirality and polarity, the network can behave like a
tri-state buffer. Considering the asymmetric magnetic vortex Transistor as a
unit, the logic gate has been formed where two such transistors are placed
parallel and another one is placed at the output. Magnetic energy given in the
input transistors is transferred to the output transistor with giant
amplification, due to the movement of antivortex solitons through the magnetic
stray field. The loss and gain of energy at the output transistor can be
controlled only by manipulating the polarities of the middle vortices in input
transistors. Due to the asymmetric energy transfer of the antivortex solitons,
we have shown successful fan-in operation in this topologically symmetric

addressing the eyeblink detection problem under the constrained indoor
conditions with the relative consistent subject and environment setup.
Nevertheless, towards the practical applications eyeblink detection in the wild
is more required, and of greater challenges. However, to our knowledge this has
not been well studied before. In this paper, we shed the light to this research
topic. A labelled eyeblink in the wild dataset (i.e., HUST-LEBW) of 673

established by us. These samples are captured from the unconstrained movies,
with the dramatic variation on human attribute, human pose, illumination
condition, imaging configuration, etc. Then, we formulate eyeblink detection
task as a spatial-temporal pattern recognition problem. After locating and
tracking human eye using SeetaFace engine and KCF tracker respectively, a
modified LSTM model able to capture the multi-scale temporal information is
proposed to execute eyeblink verification. A feature extraction approach that
reveals appearance and motion characteristics simultaneously is also proposed.
The experiments on HUST-LEBW reveal the superiority and efficiency of our
approach. It also verifies that, the existing eyeblink detection methods cannot

The development of the contour-based fracture is based on the line-based
fracture detection schemes proposed in arXiv:1902.07458. Existing Computer
Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems commonly employs Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), although the cost to obtain a high accuracy is the amount of training
data required. The purpose of the proposed schemes is to obtain a high
classification accuracy with a reduced number of training data through the use
of detected contours in X-ray images. There are two contour-based fracture
detection schemes. The first is the Standard Contour Histogram Feature-Based
(CHFB) and the second is the improved CHFB scheme. The difference between the
two schemes is the removal of the surrounding detected flesh contours from the
leg region in the improved CHFB scheme. The flesh contours are automatically
classified as non-fractures. The contours are further refined to give a precise
representation of the image edge objects. A total of 19 features are extracted
from each refined contour. 8 out of the 19 features are based on the number of
occurrences for particular detected gradients in the contour. Moreover, the
occurrence of the 0-degree gradient in the contours are employed for the
separation of the knee, leg and foot region. The features are a summary
representation of the contour, in which it is used as inputs into the
Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Both Standard CHFB and improved CHFB schemes
are evaluated with the same experimental set-ups. The average system accuracy
for the Standard CHFB scheme is 80.7%, whilst the improved CHFB scheme has an
average accuracy of 82.98%. Additionally, the hierarchical clustering technique
is adopted to highlight the fractured region within the X-ray image, using
extracted 0-degree gradients from fractured contours.

140606A, sGRB 140930B, sGRB 141212A and sGRB 151228A do not show any signature
of the extended emission or precursor activity and their spectral and temporal
properties are similar to those seen in case of other short bursts. For
sGRB130603B, our new afterglow photometric data constraints the pre jet-break
temporal decay due to denser temporal coverage. For sGRB 130603B, the afterglow
light curve, containing both our new as well as previously published
photometric data is broadly consistent with the ISM afterglow model. Modeling
of the host galaxies of sGRB 130603B and sGRB 141212A using the LePHARE
software supports a scenario in which the environment of the burst is
undergoing moderate star formation activity. From the inclusion of our
late-time data for 8 other sGRBs we are able to; place tight constraints on the
non-detection of the afterglow, host galaxy or any underlying kilonova
emission. Our late-time afterglow observations of the sGRB 170817A/GW170817 are

the status of an entity as to whether it is an outlier is based on the number
of other entities in its neighborhood. In recent years, several solutions have
tackled the problem of distance-based outliers in data streams, where outliers
must be mined continuously as new elements become available. An interesting
research problem is to combine the streaming environment with massively
parallel systems to provide scalable streambased algorithms. However, none of
the previously proposed techniques refer to a massively parallel setting. Our
proposal fills this gap and investigates the challenges in transferring
state-of-the-art techniques to Apache Flink, a modern platform for intensive
streaming analytics. We thoroughly present the technical challenges encountered
and the alternatives that may be applied. We show speed-ups of up to 117 (resp.
2076) times over a naive parallel (resp. non-parallel) solution in Flink, by
using just an ordinary four-core machine and a real-world dataset. When moving
to a three-machine cluster, due to less contention, we manage to achieve both
better scalability in terms of the window slide size and the data
dimensionality, and even higher speed-ups, e.g., by a factor of 510. Overall,
our results demonstrate that oulier mining can be achieved in an efficient and
scalable manner. The resulting techniques have been made publicly available as
open-source software.

The algorithm first generates new representations from original samples and
then fuse both into complex numbers, which avoids the difficulty of weight

linear combination of all the training samples, which mapped the sample to the
new representation space for classification by the kernel function. The
collaborative representation based classifier is then built to make

the ORL face database show that our algorithm significantly outperforms
existing methods: the average errors of previous approaches ranging from 31.66%

previous approaches ranging from 5.21% to 10.99% are reduced to 1.67% over the

To address this issue, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning with

continuous action space and convergence. Firstly, a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
is involved as the actor to obtain deterministic power control actions in
continuous space. Then, to guarantee the convergence, an online training
process is presented, which makes use of a dedicated reward function as the
target rule and a policy gradient descent algorithm to adjust DNN weights.
Experimental results show that the proposed DRL-DPT framework consistently
outperforms existing schemes in terms of energy efficiency and throughput under
different wireless interference scenarios. More specifically, it improves up to

for projecting onto the Wasserstein ball, based upon a modified version of the

within a Wasserstein ball with radius 0.1 (i.e., moving 10% of the image mass 1

have become the leading contender for constructing a scalable quantum computing
system. All current architecture designs necessitate a 2D arrangement of
superconducting qubits with nearest neighbour interactions, compatible with
powerful quantum error correction using the surface code. A major hurdle for
scalability in superconducting systems is the so called wiring problem, where
qubits internal to a chip-set become inaccessible for external control/readout
lines. Current approaches resort to intricate and exotic 3D wiring and
packaging technology which is a significant engineering challenge to realize,
while maintaining qubit fidelity. Here we solve this problem and present a
modified superconducting scalable micro-architecture that does not require any
3D external line technology and reverts back to a completely planar design.
This is enabled by a new pseudo-2D resonator network that provides inter-qubit
connections via airbridges. We carried out experiments to examine the
feasibility of the newly introduced airbridge component. The measured quality
factor of these new inter-qubit resonators is sufficient for high fidelity
gates, below the threshold for the surface code, with negligible measured
cross-talk. The resulting physical separation of the external wirings and the
inter-qubit connections on-chip should reduce cross-talk and decoherence as the
chip-set increases in size. This result demonstrates that a large-scale, fully
error corrected quantum computer can be constructed by monolithic integration
technologies without additional overhead and without special packaging
know-hows.

under the dark force can give a macroscopic charge to astronomical bodies. Yet
the requirement of having gravitationally bounded stars limits this charge to
negligible values if the force has a sizeable strength. Gravitational tests are
only possible if the dark force is weaker than gravity. By solving the
Einstein-Maxwell field equations, we study in detail an explicit model for dark
charge generation and separation in a neutron star. Charged states originate
from the decay of neutrons inside the star into three dark fermions; we show
that in this model the equation of state is consistent with limits on neutron
star masses and tidal deformability. We find that while the dark force can be
observed in binary mergers (making them an optimal observational test even
though with limited precision), it is Debye screened in binary pulsars (for
which more precise data exist). The emitted radiation in the inspiral phase of
a binary system is modified and the dark force tested at the level of the
uncertainty of the experimental detection. The test covers a region where
current limits on deviations from Newton inverse-squared law come from

singularities. Killing bottlenecks (or horizon remnants in analogy with the
corresponding definition of throats in black holes) are restrictions of the
Killing throats appearing in special classes of slowly spinning naked
singularities. Killing bottlenecks appear in association with the concept of
pre-horizon regime introduced in [1, 2]. In the extended plane of the Kerr

between black holes and naked singularities throughout the horizons. To
evaluate the effects of frame-dragging on the formation and structure of

the SED through the diffuse ISM in spiral and spheroidal galaxies, using grids
of radiative transfer precomputed with Monte Carlo simulations taking
scattering into account. The code determines the mean radiation field and the
temperature probability distribution of stochastically heated individual
grains. It then sums up their spectra to yield the overall emission by dust in
the diffuse ISM. The nebular emission of the galaxy is also computed, and a
simple modeling of the effects of dust on the SED of star-forming regions is
implemented. The main outputs are UV-to-submm SEDs of galaxies from their birth

poses many challenges, which are typically abstracted through reliability and
latency requirements. One of the main contributors to latency in cellular
networks is the reservation-based access, which involves lengthy and
resource-inefficient signaling exchanges. An alternative is to use grant-free
access, in which there is no resource reservation. A handful of recent works
investigated how to fulfill reliability and latency requirements with different
flavors of grant-free solutions. However, the resource efficiency, i.e., the
throughput, has been only the secondary focus. In this work, we formulate the
throughput of grant-free access under reliability-latency constraints, when the
actual number of arrived users or only the arrival distribution are known. We
investigate how these different levels of knowledge about the arrival process
influence throughput performance of framed slotted ALOHA with $K$-multipacket
reception, for the Poisson and Beta arrivals. We show that the throughput under
reliability-latency requirements can be significantly improved for the higher
expected load of the access network, if the actual number of arrived users is
known. This insight motivates the use of techniques for the estimation of the
number of arrived users, as this knowledge is not readily available in
grant-free access. We also asses the impact of estimation error, showing that
for high reliability-latency requirements the gains in throughput are still
considerable.

general conserved governing equation is developed and a general discrete
treatment of boundary conditions, independent of the particular choice of flux
law, is presented. We use numerical solutions of various test problems to
compare the operation and predictive ability of two discrete fractional
diffusion flux laws based on the Caputo (C) and Riemann-Liouville (RL)

flux law includes an additional term, that, in a phenomenological sense, acts
as an apparent advection transport. Through our test solutions we show that,
when compared to the performance of the C flux-law, this extra term can lead to
RL-flux law predictions that may be physically and mathematically unsound. We
conclude, by proposing a parsimonious definition for a fractional derivative
based flux law that removes the ambiguities associated with the selection

regulates a planetary climate through feedback loops such that the planet
remains habitable. Crunching 'Gaia' puzzle has been a focus of intense
empirical research. Much less attention has been paid to the mathematical
realization of this concept. In this paper, we consider the stability of a
planetary climate system with the dynamic biosphere by linking a conceptual
climate model to a generic population dynamics model with random parameters. We
first show that the dynamics of the corresponding coupled system possesses
multiple timescales and hence falls into the class of slow-fast dynamics. We
then investigate the properties of a general dynamical system to which our
model belongs and prove that the feedbacks from the biosphere dynamics cannot
break the system's stability as long as the biodiversity is sufficiently high.
That may explain why the climate is apparently stable over long time intervals.
Interestingly, our coupled climate-biosphere system can lose its stability if
biodiversity decreases; in this case, the evolution of the biosphere under the
effect of random factors can lead to a global climate change.

tasks infeasible. To learn from small data, strong inductive biases are
required. Previous work relied on hand-crafted features to encode these biases
until transfer learning emerges. Here, we explore a transfer learning method,
namely language model pretraining, on NER task in Indonesian conversational
texts. We utilize large unlabeled data (generic domain) to be transferred to
conversational texts, enabling supervised training on limited in-domain data.
We report two transfer learning variants, namely supervised model fine-tuning
and unsupervised pretrained LM fine-tuning. Our experiments show that both
variants outperform baseline neural models when trained on small data (100
sentences), yielding an absolute improvement of 32 points of test F1 score.
Furthermore, we find that the pretrained LM encodes part-of-speech information
which is a strong predictor for NER.

the most interesting topics in astrophysics, because such events have been
thought to possibly produce multimessenger signals including gravitational
waves and broadband electromagnetic (EM) waves. In this paper, we investigate
EM emission from the inspiral of a binary composed of a spinning BH and a
magnetized NS. Observationally, the BH is usually more massive than
$\sim7M_\odot$ and the NS has a mass $\simeq 1.4M_\odot$. During the inspiral
of such a binary, the BH will accumulate more and more charges based on the
charging scenario of Wald, even though the BH will eventually swallow the NS
whole inevitably. We calculate the emission luminosities and energies through
three energy dissipation mechanisms: magnetic dipole radiation, electric dipole
radiation, and magnetic reconnection. We show that magnetic dipole radiation
due to the spin of the increasingly charged BH and magnetic reconnection in
between the BH and the NS could be most significant at the final inspiral
stage. We find that if the BH is rapidly rotating and the NS is strongly
magnetized, these mechanisms would lead to a detectable EM signal (e.g., a
short-duration X-ray transient).

of interest recently and is investigated under the name cyber-physical systems.
Under cyber-physical systems one challenging scenario is multiple loops sharing
a wireless medium, and the age of the control information has to be minimized
without sacrificing reliability to guarantee the control stability. The number
of transmitting devices depends on the control parameters thus, it is
stochastic. Wireless uplink resource allocation given low latency constraints
for unknown number of devices is a hard problem. For this problem, random
access is the most prominent way to minimize latency, but reliability is
sacrificed. However, as reliability is also critical for such applications,
improved random access algorithms with hard latency guarantees are needed.
Currently available random access algorithms with hard latency guarantees have
low throughput and some of them are limited to low number of active devices. In
this work, we provide a high-throughput random access algorithm with hard
latency-constraints (SICQTA) that scales to any number of active devices. This
algorithm, making use of feedback, has a varying throughput between $0.69$ and
$1$ depending on the number of devices, which is unprecedented in the state of

goal of this paper is to improve our knowledge of the erosion of exoplanetary
atmospheres through radiation from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing
an active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase. To this end, we extended the well-known
energy-limited mass-loss model to include the case of radiation from AGNs. We
set the fraction of incident power $\epsilon$ available to heat the atmosphere
as either constant ($\epsilon = 0.1$) or flux dependent ($\epsilon =
\epsilon(F_{\textrm{XUV}})$). We calculated the possible atmospheric mass loss
for 54 known exoplanets (of which 16 are hot Jupiters residing in the Galactic
bulge and 38 are Earth-like planets (EPs)) due to radiation from the Milky
Way's (MW) central SMBH, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), and from a set of 107,220
AGNs generated using the 33,350 AGNs at $z < 0.5$ of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey database. We found that planets in the Galactic bulge might have lost up
to several Earth atmospheres in mass during the AGN phase of Sgr A*, while the
EPs are at a safe distance from Sgr A* ($> 7$ kpc) and have not undergone any
atmospheric erosion in their lifetimes. We also found that the MW EPs might
experience a mass loss up to $\sim 15$ times the Mars atmosphere over a period
of $50$ Myr as the result of exposure to the cumulative extreme-UV flux
$F_{\textrm{XUV}}$ from the AGNs up to $z = 0.5$. In both cases we found that
an incorrect choice of $\epsilon$ can lead to significant mass loss

$^{252}$Cf spontaneous fission down to $200\,$keV and up to about $12\,$MeV for

however observed for the low-energy part of the spectra, where evaluations
overestimate the number of emitted neutrons. Neutron multiplicities and average
kinetic energies as a function of incident-neutron energy are obtained

multiplicities disagree with some older datasets above $6\,$ MeV, indicating
the need of using a high-efficiency fission detector, which does not bias the

entropy and the total variation distance as the measures of deviation. The
exact order of the expected deviation of the random i.i.d. code for the soft
covering problem problem, is determined. The proof technique used in this paper
significantly differs from the previous techniques for deriving exact exponent
of the soft covering lemma. The achievability of the exact order follows from
applying the change of measure trick (which has been broadly used in the large
deviation) to the known one-shot bounds in the literature. For the ensemble
converse, some new inequalities of independent interest derived and then the
change of measure trick is applied again. The exact order of the total
variation distance is similar to the exact order of the error probability, thus
it adds another duality between the channel coding and soft covering. Finally,
The results of this paper are valid for any memoryless channels, not only
channels with finite alphabets.

properties of phosphorene are performed. Intrinsic spin-orbit coupling induces
spin mixing with the probability of $b^2 \approx 10^{-4}$, exhibiting a large
anisotropy, following the anisotropic crystalline structure of phosphorene. For
realistic values of the momentum relaxation times, the intrinsic
(Elliott--Yafet) spin relaxation times are hundreds of picoseconds to
nanoseconds. Applying a transverse electric field (simulating gating and
substrates) generates extrinsic $C_{2v}$ symmetric spin-orbit fields in
phosphorene, which activate the D'yakonov--Perel' mechanism for spin
relaxation. It is shown that this extrinsic spin relaxation also has a strong
anisotropy, and can dominate over the Elliott-Yafet one for strong enough
electric fields. Phosphorene on substrates can thus exhibit an interesting
interplay of both spin relaxation mechanisms, whose individual roles could be
deciphered using our results.

popular for their ability to visually separate distinct data clusters. However,
such methods are computationally expensive for large datasets, suffer from
stability problems, and cannot directly handle out-of-sample data. We propose a
learning approach to construct such projections. We train a deep neural network
based on a collection of samples from a given data universe, and their
corresponding projections, and next use the network to infer projections of
data from the same, or similar, universes. Our approach generates projections
with similar characteristics as the learned ones, is computationally two to
three orders of magnitude faster than SNE-class methods, has no complex-to-set

to learn any projection technique. We demonstrate our proposal on several

present a framework based on quantum forking that bypasses this fundamental
issue and expedites a family of tasks that require sampling from independent
quantum processes. Quantum forking propagates an input state to multiple
quantum trajectories in superposition, and a weighted power sum of individual
results from each trajectories is obtained in one measurement via quantum

implementing non-unitary quantum channels, studying entanglement and

applying the equations for disturbances. The velocity and electric potential
quasi-static MHD model is used. The equations allow us to calculate
time-dependent disturbance fields using a base flow and an initial disturbance.
Two type of initial perturbations are considered: the eigenfunction of the
linearized MHD equations and a fluid injection into the flow. These two
approaches lead to identical stability results. However, we found a significant
difference in the practical implementation of the two approaches. Dealing with
the eigenproblem of the linearized MHD system is a laborious task. In terms of
calculation costs it is equal to a series of nonlinear perturbation
simulations, and if the Hartmann number is increased, the proportion becomes
worse. The non-linear stability analysis produced by these two methods shows
that the injection technique can also be used in numerical analysis, and that
this method is less expensive in terms of calculation costs.

the recent experiment on electron-doped monolayers of MoS$_2$ reported by Roch

tested by measuring the linear magnetic field dependence of the spin

advantage of the existing relationship between the parameters of the baseline
distribution, which generates data from the full sample space, and the ones for
the limit Gumbel distribution. In this way, an informative prior distribution
can be obtained. Different statistical tests are used to compare the behaviour
of our method with the standard one, showing that the proposed method performs
well when dealing with very shortened available data. The empirical
effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a simulation study and a
case study. Reduction in the credible interval width and enhancement in
parameter location show that the results with improved prior adapt to very
shortened data better than standard method does.

involves electrons, holes and photons within a two-dimensional microcavity. We
show that in order to recover the simplified exciton-photon model that is
typically used to describe polaritons, one must correctly define the
exciton-photon detuning and exciton-photon (Rabi) coupling in terms of the bare
microscopic parameters. For the case of unscreened Coulomb interactions, we
find that the exciton-photon detuning is strongly shifted from its bare value
in a manner akin to renormalization in quantum electrodynamics. Within the
renormalized theory, we exactly solve the problem of a single exciton-polariton
for the first time and obtain the full spectral response of the microcavity. In
particular, we find that the electron-hole wave function of the polariton can
be significantly modified by the very strong Rabi couplings achieved in current
experiments. Our microscopic approach furthermore allows us to obtain the
effective interaction between identical polaritons for any light-matter
coupling. Crucially, we show that the standard treatment of polariton-polariton
interactions in the very strong coupling regime is incorrect, since it neglects
the light-induced modification of the exciton size and thus greatly
overestimates the effect of Pauli exclusion on the Rabi coupling, i.e., the
saturation of exciton oscillator strength. Our findings thus provide the
foundations for understanding and characterizing exciton-polariton systems
across the whole range of polariton densities.

classification is a challenging computer vision problem. In the past, most
classification approaches were based on handcrafted features. However, most
recent approaches to remote sensing scene classification are based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The de facto practice when learning these
CNN models is only to use original RGB patches as input with training performed
on large amounts of labeled data (ImageNet). In this paper, we show class
activation map (CAM) encoded CNN models, codenamed DDRL-AM, trained using
original RGB patches and attention map based class information provide
complementary information to the standard RGB deep models. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to investigate attention information encoded CNNs.
Additionally, to enhance the discriminability, we further employ a recently
developed object function called ""center loss,"" which has proved to be very
useful in face recognition. Finally, our framework provides attention guidance
to the model in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that our approach matches or exceeds the performance of other
methods.

field strength ($B_0$), radius ($R$), twist ($\alpha)$ and length of the
emerging part of the flux tube ($\lambda$) to investigate how these parameters
affect the transfer of the magnetic field from the convection zone to the
photosphere. We show that the efficiency of emergence at the photosphere (i.e.
how strong the photospheric field will be in comparison to $B_0$) depends not
only on the $B_0$ but also the morphology of the emerging field and the twist.
We show that parameters such as $B_0$ and magnetic flux cannot alone determine
whether a flux tube will emerge to the solar surface. For instance, high-$B_0$
(weak-$B_0$) fields may fail (succeed) to emerge at the photosphere, depending
on their geometrical properties. We also show that the photospheric magnetic
field strength can vary greatly for flux tubes with the same $B_0$ but
different geometric properties. Moreover, in some cases we have found scaling
laws, whereby the magnetic field strength scales with the local density as
$B\propto \rho^\kappa$, where $\kappa \approx 1$ deeper in the convection zone
and $\kappa <1$, close to the photosphere. The transition between the two
values occurs approximately when the local pressure scale ($H_p$) becomes
comparable to the diameter of the flux tube ($H_p\approx2R$). We derive forms
to explain how and when these scaling laws appear and compare them with the

topological polarizations without chiral symmetry. Extension and realization of

improve the performances of real-time forecasts which have an impact on the

high-frequency forecast (Meso-NH and Astro-Meso-Nh models) can produce reliable
predictions of different atmospheric parameters and the optical turbulence. The
mesoscale forecast has an advantage on the global model in having a better
implementation of the physical atmospheric processes, including turbulence, and
produces an output with greater spatial resolution (up to 100m or beyond).
Filtering techniques that make use of the real-time sensor data at the

on short term mesoscale forecast and, as a consequence, may increase the
accuracy of the final output. Given the complexity and cost of present and

itself in a resident population, and what does the population composition look
like then? We approach these questions in the framework of the so called Bare
Bones evolution model Klebaner et al (2011) that provides a simplified approach
to the adaptive population dynamics of binary splitting cells. As the mutant
population grows, cell division becomes less probable, and it may in fact turn
less likely than that of residents. Our analysis rests on the assumption of the
process starting from resident population, with sizes proportional to a large
carrying capacity $K$. Actually, we assume carrying capacities to be $a_1K$ and
$a_2K$ for the resident and the mutant populations, respectively, and study the
dynamics for $K\to\infty$. We find conditions for the mutant to be successful
in establishing itself alongside the resident. The time it takes turns out to
be proportional to $\log K$. We introduce the time of establishment through the
asymptotic behavior of the stochastic nonlinear dynamics describing the
evolution, and show that it is indeed $\log K/\log \rho$, where $\rho>1$ is
twice the probability of successful division of the mutant at its appearance.
Looking at the composition of the population, at times $\log K/\log \rho +n, n
\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, we find that the densities (i.e. sizes relative to carrying
capacities) of both populations follow closely the corresponding two
dimensional nonlinear deterministic dynamics that starts at {\it a random
point}. We characterise this random initial condition in terms of the scaling
limit of the corresponding dynamics, and the limit of the properly scaled
initial binary splitting process of the mutant. The deterministic approximation
with random initial condition is in fact valid asymptotically at all times
$\log K/\log \rho +n$ with $n\in \mathbb{Z}$.

rotation favours structures elongated along the rotation axis, especially in
turbulent flows. A new, wave-free mechanism is identified that challenges the
current understanding of the process. Inertial waves propagating near the
rotation axis are generally accepted as the most efficient mechanism to
transport energy anisotropically. They have been shown to transfer energy to
large anisotropic, columnar structures. Nevertheless, they cannot account for
the formation of simpler steady anisotropic phenomena such as Taylor columns.
Here, we experimentally show that more than one mechanism involving the
Coriolis force may promote anisotropy. In particular, in the limit of fast
rotation, that is at low Rossby number, anisotropy favouring the direction of
rotation of the average of a turbulent flow arises neither because of inertial
waves nor following the same mechanism as in steady Taylor columns, but from an
interplay between the Coriolis force and average advection.

deterministic and non-probabilistic. This lack of randomness is a consequential
limitation, given that a wide variety of real-world financial contracts, such
as casino games and lotteries, depend entirely on randomness. As a result,
several ad-hoc random number generation approaches have been developed to be
used in smart contracts. These include ideas such as using an oracle or relying
on the block hash. However, these approaches are manipulatable, i.e. their
output can be tampered with by parties who might not be neutral, such as the
owner of the oracle or the miners. We propose a novel game-theoretic approach
for generating provably unmanipulatable pseudorandom numbers on the blockchain.
Our approach allows smart contracts to access a trustworthy source of
randomness that does not rely on potentially compromised miners or oracles,
hence enabling the creation of a new generation of smart contracts that are not
limited to being non-probabilistic and can be drawn from the much more general
class of probabilistic programs.

Schwarzschild black hole (BH) remains at the forefront of open problems in
fundamental physics. To address this issue, we turn to Hawking's ""principle of
ignorance"", which says that, for an observer with limited information, all
descriptions that are consistent with known physics are equally valid. We
compare three different observers who view the BH from the outside and agree on
the external Schwarzschild geometry. First, the modernist, who accepts the
classical BH as the final state of gravitational collapse, the singularity
theorems that underlie this premise and the central singularity that the
theorems predict. The modernist is willing to describe matter in terms of
quantum fields in curved space but insists on (semi)classical gravity. Second
is the skeptic, who wishes to evade any singular behavior by finding a loophole
to the singularity theorems within the realm of classical general relativity
(GR). The third is a postmodernist who similarly wants to circumvent the
singularity theorems but is willing to invoke exotic quantum physics in the
gravitational and/or matter sector to do so. The postmodern view suggests that
the uncertainty principle can stabilize a classically singular BH in a similar
manner to the stabilization of the classically unstable hydrogen atom: Strong
quantum effects in the matter and gravitational sectors resolve the would-be
singularity over horizon-sized length scales. The postmodern picture then
requires a significant departure from (semi)classical gravity, as well as some
exotic matter beyond the standard model of particle physics (SM). We find that
only the postmodern framework is consistent with what is known so far about BH
physics and conclude that a valid description of the BH interior needs matter
beyond the SM and gravitational physics beyond (semi)classical GR.

patterns corresponds to the dynamics of emergence. To investigate how the

understand how the interaction graph affects dynamical properties of $f$. In
this work we introduce the following property called expansivity: the

determine the initial configuration of the whole network. Our main result is a
characterization of interaction graphs that allow expansivity. Moreover, we
show that this property is generic among linear automata networks over such

customers for fashion recommendation are rising. In this paper, we aim to
investigate a practical problem of fashion recommendation by answering the
question ""which item should we select to match with the given fashion items and
form a compatible outfit"". The key to this problem is to estimate the outfit
compatibility. Previous works which focus on the compatibility of two items or
represent an outfit as a sequence fail to make full use of the complex
relations among items in an outfit. To remedy this, we propose to represent an
outfit as a graph. In particular, we construct a Fashion Graph, where each node
represents a category and each edge represents interaction between two
categories. Accordingly, each outfit can be represented as a subgraph by
putting items into their corresponding category nodes. To infer the outfit
compatibility from such a graph, we propose Node-wise Graph Neural Networks
(NGNN) which can better model node interactions and learn better node
representations. In NGNN, the node interaction on each edge is different, which
is determined by parameters correlated to the two connected nodes. An attention
mechanism is utilized to calculate the outfit compatibility score with learned
node representations. NGNN can not only be used to model outfit compatibility
from visual or textual modality but also from multiple modalities. We conduct
experiments on two tasks: (1) Fill-in-the-blank: suggesting an item that
matches with existing components of outfit; (2) Compatibility prediction:
predicting the compatibility scores of given outfits. Experimental results
demonstrate the great superiority of our proposed method over others.

rate of over a hundred wafers an hour. During this process, a certain
percentage of the light energy is converted into heat in the wafer. In turn,
this heat causes the wafer to deform which increases the overlay error, and as
a result, reduces the manufacturing yield. To alleviate this, we propose a firm
real-time control system that uses a wafer heat feed-forward model to
compensate for the wafer deformation. The model calculates the expected wafer
deformation, and then, compensates for that by adjusting the light projection

requirements for producing appreciable amounts of HCN are the free availability

chemical mechanisms by which HCN can be formed and destroyed on rocky
exoplanets with Earth-like N$_2$ content and surface water inventories, varying
the oxidation state of the dominant carbon-containing atmospheric species. HCN

multi-periodicity of the type-I Cepheid Polaris using 161 high-precision radial
velocity (RV) and bisector inverse span (BIS) measurements based on optical
spectra recorded using Hermes at the 1.2 m Flemish Mercator telescope on La
Palma, Canary Islands, Spain. Using an empirical template fitting method, we
show that Polaris' RV amplitude has been stable to within $\sim 30 \rm{m
s}^{-1}$ between September 2011 and November 2018. We apply the template
fitting method to publicly accessible, homogeneous RV data sets from the
literature and provide an updated solution of Polaris' eccentric 29.3 yr orbit.
While the inferred pulsation-induced RV amplitudes differ among individual data
sets, we find no evidence for time-variable RV amplitudes in any of the
separately considered, homogeneous data sets. Additionally, we find that
increasing photometric amplitudes determined using SMEI photometry are likely
spurious detections due to as yet ill-understood systematic effects of
instrumental origin. Given this confusing situation, further analysis of
high-quality homogeneous data sets with well-understood systematics is required
to confidently establish whether Polaris' variability amplitude is subject to
change over time. We confirm periodic bisector variability periods of 3.97 d
and 40.22 d using Hermes BIS measurements and identify a third signal at a
period of 60.17 d. Although the 60.17 d signal dominates the BIS periodogram,
we caution that this signal may not be independent of the 40.22 d signal.
Finally, we show that the 40.22 d signal cannot be explained by stellar
rotation. Further long-term, high-quality spectroscopic monitoring is required
to unravel the complete set of Polaris' periodic signals, which has the
potential to provide unprecedented insights into the evolution of Cepheid
variables.

counteracts gravitational force. The link of the fruit's sepal shape to flight

of fault-tolerance in fully connected systems and the dependence of local and
global worst-case skews (i.e., maximum clock difference between neighbors and
arbitrary pairs of nodes, respectively) on the diameter of fault-free systems.
However, so far nothing non-trivial is known about the local skew that can be
achieved in topologies that are not fully connected even under a single
Byzantine fault. Put simply, in this work we show that the most powerful known
techniques for fault-tolerant and gradient clock synchronization are
compatible, in the sense that the best of both worlds can be achieved
simultaneously.
  Concretely, we combine the Lynch-Welch algorithm [Welch1988] for
synchronizing a clique of $n$ nodes despite up to $f<n/3$ Byzantine faults with
the gradient clock synchronization (GCS) algorithm by Lenzen et al.
[Lenzen2010] in order to render the latter resilient to faults. As this is not
possible on general graphs, we augment an input graph $\mathcal{G}$ by
replacing each node by $3f+1$ fully connected copies, which execute an instance
of the Lynch-Welch algorithm. We then interpret these clusters as supernodes
executing the GCS algorithm, where for each cluster its correct nodes'
Lynch-Welch clocks provide estimates of the logical clock of the supernode in
the GCS algorithm. By connecting clusters corresponding to neighbors in
$\mathcal{G}$ in a fully bipartite manner, supernodes can inform each other
about (estimates of) their logical clock values. This way, we achieve
asymptotically optimal local skew, granted that no cluster contains more than
$f$ faulty nodes, at factor $O(f)$ and $O(f^2)$ overheads in terms of nodes and
edges, respectively. Note that tolerating $f$ faulty neighbors trivially
requires degree larger than $f$, so this is asymptotically optimal as well.

learning from independent random patterns is quite inefficient. Here we
consider the active online learning mode in which the student designs every new
Ising training pattern. We demonstrate that it is mathematically possible to
achieve perfect (error-free) inference using only $N$ designed training
patterns, but this is computationally unfeasible for large systems. We then
investigate two Bayesian statistical designing protocols, which require $2.3 N$
and $1.9 N$ training patterns, respectively, to achieve error-free inference.
If the training patterns are instead designed through deductive reasoning,
perfect inference is achieved using $N\!+\!\log_{2}\!N$ samples. The

shortened in future work by taking into account the possibility of ergodicity

Decoherence reduces the fidelities of quantum gates when the operation time is

for CO2 emissions has recently been highlighted. Africa is a carbon sink and
nearly half its area comprises arid and semi-arid ecosystems. However, there
are uncertainties regarding CO2 fluxes for semi-arid ecosystems in Africa,
particularly savannas and dry tropical woodlands. In order to improve on
existing remote-sensing based methods for estimating carbon uptake across
semi-arid Africa we applied and tested the recently developed plant phenology
index (PPI). We developed a PPI-based model estimating gross primary
productivity (GPP) that accounts for canopy water stress, and compared it
against three other Earth observation-based GPP models: the temperature and
greenness model, the greenness and radiation model and a light use efficiency
model. The models were evaluated against in situ data from four semi-arid sites
in Africa with varying tree canopy cover (3 to 65 percent). Evaluation results
from the four GPP models showed reasonable agreement with in situ GPP measured
from eddy covariance flux towers (EC GPP) based on coefficient of variation,
root-mean-square error, and Bayesian information criterion. The PPI-based GPP
model was able to capture the magnitude of EC GPP better than the other tested
models. The results of this study show that a PPI-based GPP model is a
promising tool for the estimation of GPP in the semi-arid ecosystems of Africa.

phase evolution as a function of frequency. GW signals alone constrain the
relative amplitude and phase between different frequencies within the same
detector and between different detectors. We analyze GW170817's ability to
calibrate the LIGO/Virgo detectors, finding a relative amplitude calibration
precision of approximately $\pm20\%$ and relative phase precision of
$\pm15^\circ$ (1-$\sigma$ uncertainty) between the LIGO Hanford and Livingston
detectors. Incorporating additional information about the distance and
inclination of the source from electromagnetic observations, the relative
amplitude of the LIGO detectors can be tightened to $\sim\pm15\%$. We
investigate the ability of future events to improve astronomical calibration.
By simulating the cumulative uncertainties from an ensemble of detections, we
find that with several hundred events with electromagnetic counterparts, or
several thousand events without counterparts, we reach percent-level
astronomical calibration. This corresponds to $\sim$5-10 years of operation at
advanced LIGO and Virgo design sensitivity. It is to be emphasized that direct
{\em in-situ}\/ measurements of detector calibration provide significantly
higher precision than astronomical sources, and already constrain the
calibration to a few percent in amplitude and a few degrees in phase. In this
sense, our astronomical calibrators only corroborate existing calibration
measurements. Nonetheless, astrophysical calibration may become an important
corroboration of existing calibration methods, providing a completely
independent constraint of potential systematics.

frequency surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The SAWs are excited on the surface of
a piezoelectric lithium niobate crystal equipped with a SAW delay line onto
which the NWs were mechanically transferred. Luminescent quantum dot (QD)-like
exciton localization centers induced by compositional fluctuations within the
InGaN nanoshell were identified using stroboscopic micro-photoluminescence
(micro-PL) spectroscopy. They exhibit narrow and almost fully linearly
polarized emission lines in the micro-PL spectra and a pronounced anti-bunching
signature of single photon emission in the photon correlation experiments. When
the nanowire is perturbed by the propagating SAW, the embedded QD is
periodically strained and its excitonic transitions are modulated by the
acousto-mechanical coupling, giving rise to a spectral fine-tuning within a
~1.5 meV bandwidth at the acoustic frequency of ~330 MHz. This outcome can be
further combined with spectral detection filtering for temporal control of the
emitted photons. The effect of the SAW piezoelectric field on the QD charge
population and on the optical polarization degree is also observed. The
advantage of the acousto-optoelectric over other control schemes is that it
allows in-situ manipulation of the optical emission properties over a wide
frequency range (up to GHz frequencies).

that use trees for their gravity or hydrodynamics solvers (e.g. Adaptive Mesh
Refinement). It achieves computational speed while maintaining a specified
accuracy via controlled lowering of the resolution of both sources and rays
from each source. TREVR computes the radiation field in order ${N\log
N_{source}}$ time without absorption and order ${N \log N_{source} \log{N}}$
time with absorption. These scalings arise from merging sources of radiation
according to an opening angle criterion and walking the tree structure to trace
a ray to a depth that gives the chosen accuracy for absorption. The
absorption-depth refinement criterion is unique to TREVR. We provide a suite of
tests demonstrating the algorithm's ability to accurately compute fluxes,

$G = (V, E)$ from a distribution that is (pointwise) almost uniform over $E$.
We consider the case where there is some a priori upper bound on the arboriciy
of $G$. Given query access to a graph $G$ over $n$ vertices and of average
degree $d$ and arboricity at most $\alpha$, we design an algorithm that
performs $O\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{d} \cdot \frac{\log^3 n}{\varepsilon}\right)$
queries in expectation and returns an edge in the graph such that every edge $e
\in E$ is sampled with probability $(1 \pm \varepsilon)/m$. The algorithm
performs two types of queries: degree queries and neighbor queries. We show
that the upper bound is tight (up to poly-logarithmic factors and the
dependence in $\varepsilon$), as $\Omega\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{d} \right)$
queries are necessary for the easier task of sampling edges from any
distribution over $E$ that is close to uniform in total variational distance.
We also prove that even if $G$ is a tree (i.e., $\alpha = 1$ so that
$\frac{\alpha}{d}=\Theta(1)$), $\Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)$
queries are necessary to sample an edge from any distribution that is pointwise
close to uniform, thus establishing that a $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ factor is
necessary for constant $\alpha$. Finally we show how our algorithm can be
applied to obtain a new result on approximately counting subgraphs, based on
the recent work of Assadi, Kapralov, and Khanna (ITCS, 2019).

deformation producing multiple glitches, a strict repetition of a single
sequence of microscopic configurations often emerges. We exhibit these features
by describing the evolution of the system configuration from glitch to glitch
as a mapping of $\mathcal{N}$ states into one-another. A map $\mathbf{U}$
controls forward deformation; a second map $\mathbf{D}$ controls reverse

restrictive is the much-studied Preisach model. These maps show only the most

five additional scalar fields in the basic framework. We investigate whether

example of a sigmoid formation and eruption from small-scale flux canceling
regions of active region (AR) 11942. Analysis of HMI and AIA observations infer
that initially the AR is compact and bipolar in nature, evolved to sheared
configuration consisting of inverse J-shaped loops hosting a filament channel
over a couple of days. By tracking the photospheric magnetic features, shearing
and converging motions are observed to play a prime role in the development of
S-shaped loops and further flux cancellation leads to tether-cutting
reconnection of J-loops. This phase is co-temporal with the filament rise
motion followed by sigmoid eruption at 21:32 UT on January 6. The flux rope
rises in phases of slow (v$_{avg}$ = 26 km~s$^{-1}$) and fast (a$_{avg}$= 55
ms$^{-2}$) rise motion categorizing the CME as slow with an associated weak
C1.0 class X-ray flare. The flare ribbon separation velocity peaks at around
peak time of the flare at which maximum reconnection rate (2.14 Vcm$^{-1}$)
occurs. Further, the EUV light-curves of 131, 171\AA~have delayed peaks of 130
minutes compared to 94\AA~and is explained by differential emission measure.
Our analysis suggests that the energy release is proceeded in a much long time
duration, manifesting the onset of filament rise and eventual eruption driven
by converging and canceling flux in the photosphere. Unlike strong eruption
events, the observed slow CME and weak flare are indications of slow runway
tether-cutting reconnection where most of the sheared arcade is relaxed during
the extended post phase of the eruption.

field for a given choice of parameters (the energy and magnetic moments of
neutrinos and the strength of the magnetic field) the amplitude of the flavour
oscillations $\nu_e^L \leftrightarrow \nu_{\mu}^L$ at the vacuum frequency is
modulated by the magnetic field frequency, 2) the neutrino spin oscillation
probability (without change of the neutrino flavour) exhibits the dependence on
the mass square difference $\Delta m^2$. It is shown that the discussed
interplay of neutrino oscillations in magnetic fields on different frequencies
can have important consequences in astrophysical environments, in particular in
those peculiar for magnetars.

possess universal features. Their unimodal right-skewed shape is usually
modeled in terms of the Lognormal distribution, which is easy to fit, test, and
modify. However, empirical distributions often deviate considerably from the
Lognormal model, and both Gamma and Weibull distributions appear to better
describe the survey data. In this paper we explain the appearance of these
distributions by means of classical methods of kinetic theory of multi-agent
systems. The microscopic variation of alcohol consumption of agents around a
universal \emph{social} accepted value of consumption, is built up introducing
as main criterion for consumption a suitable value function in the spirit of
the prospect theory of Kahneman and Twersky. The mathematical properties of the
value function then determine the unique macroscopic equilibrium which results
to be a generalized Gamma distribution. The modeling of the microscopic kinetic
interaction allows to clarify the meaning of the various parameters
characterizing the generalized Gamma equilibrium.

a given user the number of sequential blocks is below or above some given
thresholds estimated over the distribution of the number of blocks in the

that in the case where the ranking loss is convex, the deviation between the

nor efficient and can not be utilized in clinic. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for CMR motion artifact correction using deep learning.
Specially, we use deep residual network (ResNet) as net framework and train our
model in adversarial manner. Our approach is motivated by the connection
between image motion blur and CMR motion artifact, so we can transfer methods
from motion-deblur where deep learning has made great progress to CMR
motion-correction successfully. To evaluate motion artifact correction methods,
we propose a novel algorithm on how edge detection results are improved by
deblurred algorithm. Boosted by deep learning and adversarial training
algorithm, our model is trainable in an end-to-end manner, can be tested in
real-time and achieves the state-of-art results for CMR correction.

  pipelines",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data science relies on pipelines that are organized in the form of
interdependent computational steps. Each step consists of various candidate
algorithms that maybe used for performing a particular function. Each algorithm
consists of several hyperparameters. Algorithms and hyperparameters must be
optimized as a whole to produce the best performance. Typical machine learning
pipelines consist of complex algorithms in each of the steps. Not only is the
selection process combinatorial, but it is also important to interpret and
understand the pipelines. We propose a method to quantify the importance of
different components in the pipeline, by computing an error contribution
relative to an agnostic choice of computational steps, algorithms and
hyperparameters. We also propose a methodology to quantify the propagation of
error from individual components of the pipeline with the help of a naive set
of benchmark algorithms not involved in the pipeline. We demonstrate our
methodology on image classification pipelines. The agnostic and naive
methodologies quantify the error contribution and propagation respectively from
the computational steps, algorithms and hyperparameters in the image
classification pipeline. We show that algorithm selection and hyperparameter
optimization methods like grid search, random search and Bayesian optimization
can be used to quantify the error contribution and propagation, and that random
search is able to quantify them more accurately than Bayesian optimization.
This methodology can be used by domain experts to understand machine learning
and data analysis pipelines in terms of their individual components, which can
help in prioritizing different components of the pipeline.

Apriori-like distributed algorithm, using both analytical and experimental

performance of a distributed Apriori-like algorithm is not related to global
strategies of pruning since the performance of the local Apriori generation is
usually characterized by relatively high success rates of candidate sets
frequency at low levels which switch to very low rates at some stage, and often
drops to zero. This means that the intermediate communication steps and remote
support counts computation and collection in classical distributed schemes are
computationally inefficient locally, and then constrains the global
performance. Our performance evaluation is done on a large cluster of
workstations using the Condor system and its workflow manager DAGMan. The
results show that the presented approach greatly enhances the performance and
achieves good scalability compared to a typical distributed Apriori founded

performances (e.g. 16 ohm sq --1 at 93% transparency), with haze values varying
from 1.6 to 26.2%. Besides, in vitro toxicological studies carried out on
murine macrophages with the same size standards revealed that AgNWs are weakly
toxic (no toxicity observed below 50 $\mu$g mL --1 Ag), in particular compared
to other silver nanoparticles. Short AgNWs (4 $\mu$m) appeared to be slightly
more toxic than longer AgNWs (10 and 20 $\mu$m). Conversely, long AgNWs (20

macrophages. These results contribute, in a safer by design approach, to
promoting the use of short AgNWs. The global knowledge dealing with the

performance of the partially transparent radiative windows and radiative
coolers. Our physical model includes the atmosphere, the window, and the
backwall that are all in the thermal equilibrium with each other, and that can
exchange energy via radiative heat transfer or convection. Moreover, we use a
simplified two-state model for the optical properties of an atmosphere and a
window material which assumes two distinct sets of the optical
reflection/absorption/transmission parameters in the visible/near-IR versus
mid-IR spectral ranges. Furthermore, we have distinguished the design goals for
the partially transparent windows and radiative coolers and provided optimal
choice for the material parameters to realize these goals. Thus, radiative
coolers are normally non-transparent in the visible, and the main goal is to
design a cooler with the temperature of its dark side as low as possible
compared to that of the atmosphere. For the radiative windows, however, their
surfaces are necessarily partially transparent in the visible. In the cooling
mode, therefore, the main question is about the maximal visible light
transmission through the window at which the temperature on the window somber
side does not exceed that of the atmosphere. We believe that our simple, yet
in-depth comparative analysis of the radiative windows and coolers can be
useful for a large number of scientists and engineers pursuing research in
these disciplines.
