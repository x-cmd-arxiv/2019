For this purpose, we propose a new method combining hyperbolic embeddings and

inferring concept hierarchies from distributional contexts while also being
able to predict missing is-a relationships and to correct wrong extractions.
Moreover -- and in contrast with other methods -- the hierarchical nature of
hyperbolic space allows us to learn highly efficient representations and to
improve the taxonomic consistency of the inferred hierarchies. Experimentally,
we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several

approximation and sparsity pruning to remove redundant parameters from a
learned hidden layer. However, they process each hidden layer individually
while neglecting the common components across layers, and thus are not able to
fully exploit the potential redundancy space for compression. To solve the
above problem and enable further compression of a model, removing the
cross-layer redundancy and mining the layer-wise inheritance knowledge is
necessary. In this paper, we introduce a holistic model compression framework,
namely MIning Cross-layer Inherent similarity Knowledge (MICIK), to fully
excavate the potential redundancy space. The proposed MICIK framework
simultaneously, (1) learns the common and unique weight components across deep
neural network layers to increase compression rate; (2) preserves the inherent
similarity knowledge of nearby layers and distant layers to minimize the
accuracy loss and (3) can be complementary to other existing compression
techniques such as knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on large-scale
convolutional neural networks demonstrate that MICIK is superior over

a generalization of the famous 0-1 knapsack problem (i.e., $1$-dimensional KP)
in which an upper bound $K$ is imposed on the number of items selected. This
problem is of fundamental importance and is known to have a broad range of
applications in various fields. It is well known that, there is no FPTAS for
the $d$-dimensional knapsack problem when $d\geq 2$, unless P $=$ NP. While the
$K$-item knapsack problem is known to admit an FPTAS, the complexity of all
existing FPTASs have a high dependency on the cardinality bound $K$ and
approximation error $\varepsilon$, which could result in inefficiencies
especially when $K$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ increase. The current best results
are due to Mastrolilli and Hutter (2006), in which two schemes are presented
exhibiting a space-time tradeoff--one scheme with time complexity
$O(n+Kz^{2}/\varepsilon^{2})$ and space complexity $O(n+z^{3}/\varepsilon)$,
while another scheme requires $O(n+(Kz^{2}+z^{4})/\varepsilon^{2})$ run-time
but only needs $O(n+z^{2}/\varepsilon)$ space, where
$z=\min\{K,1/\varepsilon\}$. In this paper we close the space-time tradeoff
exhibited in the state-of-the-art by designing a new FPTAS with a run-time of
$\widetilde{O}(n+z^{2}/\varepsilon^{2})$, while simultaneously reaching the
$O(n+z^{2}/\varepsilon)$ space bound. Our scheme provides $\widetilde{O}(K)$
and $O(z)$ improvements on the state-of-the-art algorithms in time and space
complexity respectively, and is the first scheme that achieves a run-time that
is independent of cardinality bound $K$ (up to logarithmic factors) under fixed
$\varepsilon$. Another salient feature of our scheme is that it is the first
FPTAS that achieves better time and space complexity bounds than the very first
standard FPTAS over all parameter regimes.

that every jet in our sample involved a filament-channel eruption. From the

finite-time bounds on the mean-square error in the case of constant step-size
algorithms by considering the drift of an appropriately chosen Lyapunov
function. The Lyapunov function can be interpreted either in terms of Stein's
method to obtain bounds on steady-state performance or in terms of Lyapunov
stability theory for linear ODEs. We also provide a comprehensive treatment of
the moments of the square of the 2-norm of the approximation error. Our

the lower-order moments can be made small as a function of the step-size and
can be upper-bounded by the moments of a Gaussian random variable; (ii) we show
that the higher-order moments beyond a threshold may be infinite in

uncertainty in a statistically principled way through sampling from the

notion of a weak (proper) Calabi-Yau structure. We prove the existence of a
relative weak Calabi-Yau pairing on Biran and Cornea's Fukaya category of
Lagrangian cobordisms $\mathcal{F}uk_{\mathit{cob}}(\mathbb{C}\times M)$. Here
$M$ is a symplectic manifold which is closed or tame at infinity. This duality
structure on $\mathcal{F}uk_{\mathit{cob}}(\mathbb{C}\times M)$ extends the
relative Poincar\'e duality satisfied by Floer complexes for pairs of
Lagrangian cobordisms. Moreover, we show that the relative weak Calabi-Yau
pairing on $\mathcal{F}uk_{\mathit{cob}}(\mathbb{C}\times M)$ satisfies a
compatibility condition with respect to the usual weak Calabi-Yau structure on
the monotone Fukaya category of $M$.
  The construction of the relative weak Calabi-Yau pairing on
$\mathcal{F}uk_{\mathit{cob}}(\mathbb{C}\times M)$ is based on counts of curves
in $\mathbb{C}\times M$ satisfying an inhomogeneous nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann
equation. In order to prove the existence of this duality structure and to
verify its properties, we extend the methods of Biran and Cornea to establish
regularity and compactness results for the relevant moduli spaces. We also
consider the implications of the existence of the relative weak Calabi-Yau
pairing on $\mathcal{F}uk_{\mathit{cob}}(\mathbb{C}\times M)$ for the cone
decomposition in the derived Fukaya category of $M$ associated to a Lagrangian
cobordism, and we present an example involving Lagrangian surgery.

posteriori analysis of the least-squares parameter estimates. The optimal
design is achieved by using the available (experimental) degrees of freedom
such that more informative measurements are obtained. Unlike the commonly used
approaches, which base the OED procedure upon the linearized CRs, we explore a
path where we explicitly consider the exact CRs in the OED framework. We use a
methodology for a finite parametrization of the exact CRs within the OED
problem and we introduce a novel approximation technique of the exact CRs using
inner- and outer-approximating ellipsoids as a computationally less demanding
alternative. The employed techniques give the OED problem as a
finite-dimensional mathematical program of bilevel nature. We use two
small-scale illustrative case studies to study various OED criteria and compare
the resulting optimal designs with the commonly used linearization-based

one of the first light instruments of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).
Doing high precision multi-object differential astrometry behind ELT is
particularly effective given the increased flux and small diffraction limit.
Thanks to its robust design with fixed mirrors and a cryogenic environment,
MICADO aims to provide 50 $\mu$as absolute differential astrometry (measure
star-to-star distances in absolute $\mu$as units) over a 53"" FoV in the range
1.2-2.5 $\mu$m. Tackling high precision astrometry over large FoV requires
Multi Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) and an accurate distortion calibration.
The MICADO control scheme relies on the separate calibration of the ELT, MAORY
and MICADO systematics and distortions, to ensure the best disentanglement and
correction of all the contributions. From a system perspective, we are
developing an astrometric error budget supported by optical simulations to
assess the impact of the main astrometric errors induced by the telescope and
its optical tolerances, the MCAO distortions and the opto-mechanical errors
between internal optics of ELT, MAORY and MICADO. The development of an overall
astrometric error budget will pave the road to an efficient calibration
strategy complementing the design of the MICADO calibration unit. At the focus
of this work are a number of opto-mechanical error terms which have particular

inefficiently, converting only a small fraction of its mass to stars per
dynamical time. However, star formation models generally predict the existence
of a threshold density above which the process is efficient and most mass
collapses to stars on a dynamical timescale. A number of authors have proposed
observational techniques to search for a threshold density above which star
formation is efficient, but it is unclear which of these techniques, if any,
are reliable. In this paper we use detailed simulations of turbulent,
magnetised star-forming clouds, including stellar radiation and outflow
feedback, to investigate whether it is possible to recover star formation
thresholds using current observational techniques. Using mock observations of
the simulations at realistic resolutions, we show that plots of projected star
formation efficiency per free-fall time $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ can detect the
presence of a threshold, but that the resolutions typical of current dust
emission or absorption surveys are insufficient to determine its value. In
contrast, proposed alternative diagnostics based on a change in the slope of
the gas surface density versus star formation rate surface density
(Kennicutt-Schmidt relation) or on the correlation between young stellar object
counts and gas mass as a function of density are ineffective at detecting
thresholds even when they are present. The signatures in these diagnostics
sometimes taken as indicative of a threshold in observations, which we
generally reproduce in our mock observations, do not prove to correspond to
real physical features in the 3D gas distribution.

which are modulated by two distinguishable constellation alphabets drawn from
the distinct two constellations.
  In this paper, a new constellation design for DM-OFDM-IM is proposed based on
the pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis. In previous works, the design of
the constellation pair is naive and induces much power. Also, a new bit mapping
scheme for DM-OFDM-IM is proposed. The proposed bit mapping scheme can relieve
the catastrophic effect of the index demodulation error incurring burst of

the weak cosmic censorship preserved. To obtain these results, we follow the
analysis of Sorce and Wald on their gedanken experiments to destroy a
Kerr-Newman black hole, and calculate the second order corrections to the black
hole mass. Furthermore, Wald's type of gedanken experiment provides an
operational procedure of proving the third law of black hole mechanics. Through
the AdS/CFT correspondence, our results on BTZ black holes also indicate that a
third law of thermodynamics holds for the holographic conformal field theories
dual to 3-dimensional Einstein gravity and chiral gravity.

edges and small Urbach energies allowing for efficient collection of sunlight
in thin-film photovoltaic devices. However, halide perovskites also exhibit
large nuclear anharmonic effects and disorder, which is unusual for efficient
optoelectronic materials and difficult to rationalize in view of the small
Urbach energies that indicate a low amount of disorder. To address this
important issue, the disorder potential induced for electronic states by the
nuclear dynamics in various paradigmatic halide perovskites is studied with
molecular dynamics and density functional theory. We find that the disorder
potential is dynamically shortened due to the nuclear motions in the
perovskite, such that it is short-range correlated, which is shown to lead to
favorable distributions of band edge energies. This dynamic mechanism allows
for sharp optical absorption edges and small Urbach energies, which are highly
desired properties of any solar absorber material.

stable attractor: either a fixed point (like in the subthreshold regime) or a
limit cycle that defines the tonic firing of action potentials (in the
suprathreshold regime). In two of the three spike onset bifurcation sequences
that are known to give rise to all-or-none type action potentials, however, the
resting-state fixpoint and limit cycle spiking can coexist in an intermediate
regime, resulting in bistable dynamics. Here, noise can induce switches between
the attractors, i.e., between rest and spiking, and thus increase the
variability of the spike train compared to neurons with only one stable
attractor. Qualitative features of the resulting spike statistics depend on the
spike onset bifurcations. This study focuses on the creation of the spiking
limit cycle via the saddle-homoclinic orbit (HOM) bifurcation and derives
interspike interval (ISI) densities for a conductance-based neuron model in the
bistable regime. The ISI densities of bistable homoclinic neurons are found to
be unimodal yet distinct from the inverse Gaussian distribution associated with
the saddle-node-on-invariant-cycle (SNIC) bifurcation. It is demonstrated that
for the HOM bifurcation the transition between rest and spiking is mainly
determined along the downstroke of the action potential -- a dynamical feature
that is not captured by the commonly used reset neuron models. The deduced
spike statistics can help to identify HOM dynamics in experimental data.

can be used to make the voice sound in tune with the accompaniment. This
approach differs from commercially used automatic pitch correction systems,
where notes in the vocal tracks are shifted to be centered around notes in a
user-defined score or mapped to the closest pitch among the twelve
equal-tempered scale degrees. We train the model using a dataset of 4,702

30$^{\circ}$ latitude and a roughly 600-m radar-dark region near one of the
poles. Overall, the radar images of Phaethon are reminiscent of those of
(101955) Bennu, target of the OSIRIS-REx mission. As such, the shape of
Phaethon is suspected to have an equatorial ridge similar to the top-shaped
models of several other radar-observed near-Earth asteroids as well as the
optical images of (162173) Ryugu returned by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft.
Preliminary analysis of the radar data finds no satellites and gives no

fermion system: Pressure suppresses local-moment antiferromagnetic (AFM) order
and induces superconductivity in a dome around the associated quantum critical
point (QCP) near $p_{c} \approx 23\,$kbar. Strong magnetic fields also suppress
the AFM order at a field-induced QCP at $B_{\rm c}\approx 50\,$T. In its
vicinity, a nematic phase at $B^*\approx 28\,$T characterized by a large
in-plane resistivity anisotropy emerges. Here, we directly investigate the
interrelation between these phenomena via magnetoresistivity measurements under
high pressure. As pressure increases, the nematic transition shifts to higher
fields, until it vanishes just below $p_{\rm c}$. While pressure suppresses
magnetic order in zero field as $p_{\rm c}$ is approached, we find magnetism to
strengthen under strong magnetic fields due to suppression of the Kondo effect.
We reveal a strongly non-mean-field-like phase diagram, much richer than the
common local-moment description of CeRhIn$_5$ would suggest.

Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the literature on generative modelling has
witnessed an overwhelming resurgence. The impressive, yet elusive empirical
performance of GANs has lead to the rise of many GAN-VAE hybrids, with the
hopes of GAN level performance and additional benefits of VAE, such as an
encoder for feature reduction, which is not offered by GANs. Recently, the
Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) was proposed, achieving performance similar to
that of GANs, yet it is still unclear whether the two are fundamentally
different or can be further improved into a unified model. In this work, we
study the $f$-GAN and WAE models and make two main discoveries. First, we find
that the $f$-GAN and WAE objectives partake in a primal-dual relationship and
are equivalent under some assumptions, which then allows us to explicate the
success of WAE. Second, the equivalence result allows us to, for the first
time, prove generalization bounds for Autoencoder models, which is a pertinent
problem when it comes to theoretical analyses of generative models.
Furthermore, we show that the WAE objective is related to other statistical
quantities such as the $f$-divergence and in particular, upper bounded by the
Wasserstein distance, which then allows us to tap into existing efficient
(regularized) optimal transport solvers. Our findings thus present the first
primal-dual relationship between GANs and Autoencoder models, comment on
generalization abilities and make a step towards unifying these models.

a hidden response value that we assume derives from an underlying linear model,
and we wish to pick a small subset of the vectors such that querying the
corresponding responses will lead to a good estimator of the model. A classical
approach in statistics is to assume the responses are linear, plus zero-mean
i.i.d. Gaussian noise, in which case the goal is to provide an unbiased
estimator with smallest mean squared error (A-optimal design). A related
approach, more common in computer science, is to assume the responses are
arbitrary but fixed, in which case the goal is to estimate the least squares
solution using few responses, as quickly as possible, for worst-case inputs.
Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two
approaches has proven elusive. We address this by proposing a framework for
experimental design where the responses are produced by an arbitrary unknown
distribution. We show that there is an efficient randomized experimental design
procedure that achieves strong variance bounds for an unbiased estimator using
few responses in this general model. Nearly tight bounds for the classical
A-optimality criterion, as well as improved bounds for worst-case responses,
emerge as special cases of this result. In the process, we develop a new
algorithm for a joint sampling distribution called volume sampling, and we
propose a new i.i.d. importance sampling method: inverse score sampling. A key
novelty of our analysis is in developing new expected error bounds for
worst-case regression by controlling the tail behavior of i.i.d. sampling via
the jointness of volume sampling. Our result motivates a new minimax-optimality
criterion for experimental design which can be viewed as an extension of both
A-optimal design and sampling for worst-case regression.

Classical Cepheids, primary distance indicators with distance accuracies of

subtends a mean angle of 17.5 \pm 1 (formal) \pm 3 (systematic) and exhibits a
leading spiral pattern. Our Galaxy thus follows Briggs' rule for spiral
galaxies, which suggests that the origin of the warp is associated with torques
forced by the massive inner disk. The stellar disk traced by Cepheids follows
the gas disk in terms of their amplitudes; the stellar disk extends to at least
20 kpc. This morphology provides a crucial, updated map for studies of the

overwhelmingly many of the discovered patterns are redundant. A prototypical
example of such redundancy is a freerider pattern where the pattern contains a
true pattern and some additional noise events. A technique for filtering
freerider patterns that has proved to be efficient in ranking itemsets is to
use a partition model where a pattern is divided into two subpatterns and the
observed support is compared to the expected support under the assumption that
these two subpatterns occur independently.
  In this paper we develop a partition model for episodes, patterns discovered
from sequential data. An episode is essentially a set of events, with possible
restrictions on the order of events. Unlike with itemset mining, computing the
expected support of an episode requires surprisingly sophisticated methods. In
order to construct the model, we partition the episode into two subepisodes. We
then model how likely the events in each subepisode occur close to each other.
If this probability is high---which is often the case if the subepisode has a
high support---then we can expect that when one event from a subepisode occurs,
then the remaining events occur also close by. This approach increases the
expected support of the episode, and if this increase explains the observed
support, then we can deem the episode uninteresting. We demonstrate in our
experiments that using the partition model can effectively and efficiently
reduce the redundancy in episodes.

wavelet transforms implemented by their matrix formulation. This non-decimated
complex wavelet spectra utilizes both real and imaginary parts of
complex-valued wavelet coefficients via their modulus and phases. A structural
redundancy in non-decimated wavelets and a componential redundancy in complex
wavelets act in a synergy when extracting wavelet-based informative
descriptors. In particular, we suggest an improved way of separating signals
and images based on their scaling indices in terms of spectral slopes and
information contained in the phase in order to improve performance of
classification. We show that performance of the proposed method is
significantly improved when compared with procedures based on standard versions
of wavelet transforms or on real-valued wavelets. It is also worth mentioning
that the matrix-based non-decimated wavelet transform can handle signals of an
arbitrary size and in 2-D case, rectangular images of possibly different and
non-dyadic dimensions. This is in contrast to the standard wavelet transforms
where algorithms for handling objects of non-dyadic dimensions requires either
data preprocessing or customized algorithm adjustments. To demonstrate the use
of defined spectral methodology we provide two examples of application on
real-data problems: classification of visual acuity using scaling in pupil
diameter dynamic in time and diagnostic and classification of digital mammogram
images using the fractality of digitized images of the background tissue. The
proposed tools are contrasted with the traditional wavelet based counterparts.

on the framework of one-dimensional and two-dimensional interaction topologies.
Recently, the emergence of such fascinating phenomena has been studied in
three-dimensional (3D) grid formation while considering only the nonlocal
interaction. Here we study the emergence and existence of chimera patterns in a
three dimensional network of coupled Stuart-Landau limit cycle oscillators and
Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal oscillators with local (nearest neighbour) interaction
topology. The emergence of different types of spatiotemporal chimera patterns
is investigated by taking two distinct nonlinear interaction functions. We
provide appropriate analytical explanations in the 3D grid of network formation
and the corresponding numerical justifications are given. We extend our
analysis on the basis of Ott-Antonsen reduction approach in the case of
Stuart-Landau oscillators containing infinite number of oscillators.
Particularly, in Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal network the existence of
non-stationary chimera states are characterized by instantaneous strength of
incoherence and instantaneous local order parameter. Besides, the condition for
achieving exact neuronal synchrony is obtained analytically through a linear
stability analysis. The different types of collective dynamics together with
chimera states are mapped over a wide range of various parameter spaces.

changing the size of the fullerene particles. We also measured the diffusion
constant of the fullerene particles and the shear viscosity of the host fluid,
and then the hydrodynamic radius $a_\mathrm{HD}$ was quantified from the
Stokes-Einstein relation. The $a_\mathrm{HD}$ value exceeds that of the
gyration radius of the fullerene when the solvation free energy exhibits
largely negative values using the LJ potential. In contrast, $a_\mathrm{HD}$
becomes comparable to the size of bare fullerene, when the solvation free
energy is positive using the WCA potential. Furthermore, the VACF of the
fullerene particles is directly comparable with the analytical expressions
utilizing the Navier-Stokes equations both in incompressible and compressible
forms. Hydrodynamic long-time tail $t^{-3/2}$ is demonstrated for timescales
longer than the kinematic time of the momentum diffusion over the particles'

description, particularly for smaller fullerene particles and for the LJ
potential. This occurs even though the compressible effect is considered when
characterizing the decay of VACF around the sound propagation time scale over

the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) technique is proposed to mitigate inter-cell
interference to improve the coverage of high data rate services, cell-edge
throughput, and system capacity. However, the joint transmission (JT) CoMP
technique is difficult to be applied in practice due to the critical time
synchronization for multiple coordination links and the bottleneck of backhaul
capacity and radio resource at each small cell base stations (SBSs). Moreover,
since the coordination SBSs in the conditional scheme are entirely separate
from each other, different time of arrivals at the user cause the severe time
synchronization problem. The anisotropic propagation environment in the urban
scenario makes the implementation condition even worse. To tackle these issues,
we propose a novel JT-CoMP scheme with the anisotropic path loss model to
minimize the network backhaul traffic subject to the constraints on the radio
resource and the differences in time of arrivals. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed distance-resource-limited CoMP scheme can obtain
the maximum achievable rate with the minimum network backhaul traffic, compared

different features for adaptive visual tracking. The framework consists of four
layers. A feature extraction layer is designed to extract the different
features of the target region and search region. The extracted features are
then put into a weight generation layer to obtain the channel weights, which
indicate the importance of different feature channels. Both features and the
channel weights are utilized in a template generation layer to generate a
discriminative template. Finally, the corresponding response maps created by
the convolution of the search region features and the template are applied with
a fusion layer to obtain the final response map for locating the target.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the popular Temple-Color, OTB50 and UAV123
benchmarks.

detect 13 C I emission lines in iota Her (normal in C), while only one C I
emission line is found in 3 Cen A (deficient in C). Many emission lines of P II

absorption lines in this star. Because these two stars have nearly the same

controls the movement of the template such that at each iteration, the template
better aligns with the reference in terms of shape. This constraint enables the
alignment in difficult conditions indtroduced by change (presence of outliers

Finally, the computational time for EVAR simulations is reduced of a factor 6

model which incorporates the stochastic dynamics of the app-based ride-hailing

standard economic theory, enforcing a minimum wage for drivers benefits both

surprising outcome holds for almost all model parameters, and it occurs because
the wage floors curbs TNC labor market power. In contrast to a wage floor,
imposing a cap on the number of vehicles hurts drivers, because the platform
reaps all the benefits of limiting supply. The congestion tax has the expected
impact: fares increase, wages and platform revenue decrease. We also construct

state-of-the-art algorithm reduces this task to set of local linear subspace
reconstruction and clustering problem using Grassmann manifold representation
\cite{kumar2018scalable}. Unfortunately, their method missed on some of the
critical issues associated with the modeling of surface deformations, for e.g.,
the dependence of a local surface deformation on its neighbors. Furthermore,
their representation to group high dimensional data points inevitably introduce
the drawbacks of categorizing samples on the high-dimensional Grassmann
manifold \cite{huang2015projection, harandi2014manifold}. Hence, to deal with
such limitations with \cite{kumar2018scalable}, we propose an algorithm that
jointly exploits the benefit of high-dimensional Grassmann manifold to perform
reconstruction, and its equivalent lower-dimensional representation to infer
suitable clusters. To accomplish this, we project each Grassmannians onto a
lower-dimensional Grassmann manifold which preserves and respects the
deformation of the structure w.r.t its neighbors. These Grassmann points in the
lower-dimension then act as a representative for the selection of
high-dimensional Grassmann samples to perform each local reconstruction. In
practice, our algorithm provides a geometrically efficient way to solve dense
NRSfM by switching between manifolds based on its benefit and usage.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective in
handling noise with reconstruction accuracy as good as or better than the

fixed mixing weights by an adaptive, input-dependent distribution (specifying
the probability of each component) represented by NNs, and by considering
uncountably many mixture components. The resulting class of models can be seen
as the continuous counterpart to mixture density networks and is therefore
referred to as compound density networks (CDNs). We employ both maximum
likelihood and variational Bayesian inference to train CDNs, and empirically
show that they yield better uncertainty estimates on out-of-distribution data
and are more robust to adversarial examples than the previous approaches.

classifier can be learned efficiently; but (c) it is computationally hard to
learn a robust classifier, assuming the hardness of factoring large numbers.
The question of whether a robust classifier for their task exists in the large
perturbation regime seems related to important open questions in computational
number theory. In this work, we extend their work in three directions.
  First, we demonstrate classification tasks where computationally efficient
robust classification is impossible, even when computationally unbounded robust
classifiers exist. For this, we rely on the existence of average-case hard
functions.
  Second, we show hard-to-robustly-learn classification tasks in the
large-perturbation regime. Namely, we show that even though an efficient
classifier that is robust to large perturbations exists, it is computationally
hard to learn any non-trivial robust classifier. Our first construction relies
on the existence of one-way functions, and the second on the hardness of the
learning parity with noise problem. In the latter setting, not only does a
non-robust classifier exist, but also an efficient algorithm that generates
fresh new labeled samples given access to polynomially many training examples
(termed as generation by Kearns et. al. (1994)).
  Third, we show that any such counterexample implies the existence of
cryptographic primitives such as one-way functions. This leads us to a win-win

ion and the radio frequency electric field of the ion trap is analyzed. Such a
coupling is negligible for the lowest energy levels of a trapped ion but it is
important for a trapped Rydberg ion due to its large electric dipole moment.
This coupling cannot be neglected by the standard rotating-wave approximation
because it is comparable to the frequency of the trapping electric field. We
investigate the effect of the quadrupole coupling by performing a suitable
effective representation of the Hamiltonian. For a single ion we show that in
this effective picture the quadrupole interaction is replaced by rescaled laser
intensities and additional Stark shifts of the Rydberg levels. Hence this
detrimental quadrupole coupling can be efficiently compensated by an
appropriate increase of the Rabi frequencies. Moreover, we consider the strong
dipole-dipole interaction between a pair of Rydberg ions in the presence of the
quadrupole coupling. In the effective representation we observe reducing of the
dipole-dipole coupling as well as additional spin-spin interaction.

  Giovanna D'Agostino",,"10.1137/1.9781611975994.55",,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Indexing strings via prefix (or suffix) sorting is, arguably, one of the most
successful algorithmic techniques developed in the last decades. Can indexing
be extended to languages? The main contribution of this paper is to initiate
the study of the sub-class of regular languages accepted by an automaton whose
states can be prefix-sorted. Starting from the recent notion of Wheeler graph
[Gagie et al., TCS 2017]-which extends naturally the concept of prefix sorting
to labeled graphs-we investigate the properties of Wheeler languages, that is,
regular languages admitting an accepting Wheeler finite automaton.
Interestingly, we characterize this family as the natural extension of regular
languages endowed with the co-lexicographic ordering: when sorted, the strings
belonging to a Wheeler language are partitioned into a finite number of
co-lexicographic intervals, each formed by elements from a single Myhill-Nerode
equivalence class. Moreover: (i) We show that every Wheeler NFA (WNFA) with $n$
states admits an equivalent Wheeler DFA (WDFA) with at most $2n-1-|\Sigma|$
states that can be computed in $O(n^3)$ time. This is in sharp contrast with
general NFAs. (ii) We describe a quadratic algorithm to prefix-sort a proper
superset of the WDFAs, a $O(n\log n)$-time online algorithm to sort acyclic
WDFAs, and an optimal linear-time offline algorithm to sort general WDFAs. By
contribution (i), our algorithms can also be used to index any WNFA at the
moderate price of doubling the automaton's size. (iii) We provide a
minimization theorem that characterizes the smallest WDFA recognizing the same
language of any input WDFA. The corresponding constructive algorithm runs in
optimal linear time in the acyclic case, and in $O(n\log n)$ time in the
general case. (iv) We show how to compute the smallest WDFA equivalent to any
acyclic DFA in nearly-optimal time.

Additionally, the practical importance of ESR has attracted an increasing
amount of research attention, but the chaotic and non-stationary difficulties
continue to make it a challenging task. In this study, we propose a spike-based
framework from a more brain-like perspective for the ESR task. Our framework is
a unifying system with a consistent integration of three major functional parts
which are sparse encoding, efficient learning and robust readout. We first
introduce a simple sparse encoding where key-points are used for feature
representation, and demonstrate its generalization to both spike and non-spike
based systems. Then, we evaluate the learning properties of different learning
rules in details with our contributions being added for improvements. Our
results highlight the advantages of the multi-spike learning, providing a
selection reference for various spike-based developments. Finally, we combine
the multi-spike readout with the other parts to form a system for ESR.
Experimental results show that our framework performs the best as compared to
other baseline approaches. In addition, we show that our spike-based framework
has several advantageous characteristics including early decision making, small
dataset acquiring and ongoing dynamic processing. Our framework is the first
attempt to apply the multi-spike characteristic of nervous neurons to ESR. The
outstanding performance of our approach would potentially contribute to draw
more research efforts to push the boundaries of spike-based paradigm to a new

derive these results from a general structure theorem for cubic couplings,
thereby unifying these results with the Host-Kra Ergodic Structure Theorem. A
unification of this kind had been propounded as a conceptual prospect by Host
and Kra. Our work also provides new results on nilspaces. In particular, we
obtain a new stability result for nilspace morphisms. We also strengthen a
result of Gutman, Manners and Varj\'u, by proving that a $k$-step compact
nilspace of finite rank is a toral nilspace (in particular, a connected
nilmanifold) if and only if its $k$-dimensional cube set is connected. We also
prove that if a morphism from a cyclic group of prime order into a compact
finite-rank nilspace is sufficiently balanced (i.e. equidistributed in a
certain quantitative and multidimensional sense), then the nilspace is toral.
As an application of this, we obtain a new proof of a refinement of the

due to a mean shear flow leads to a magnetic eddy viscosity. The magnetic
viscosity is derived from simple physical arguments, where a coherent response
due to shear flow builds up in the magnetic field until decorrelated by
turbulent motion. The dynamic viscosity coefficient is approximately
$(B_p^2/2\mu_0) \tau_{\rm corr}$, the poloidal magnetic energy density
multiplied by the correlation time. We confirm the magnetic eddy viscosity
through numerical simulations of two-dimensional incompressible
magnetohydrodynamics. We also consider the three-dimensional case, and in
cylindrical or spherical geometry, theoretical considerations similarly point
to a nonzero viscosity whenever there is differential rotation. Hence, these
results serve as a dynamical generalization of Ferraro's law of isorotation.
The magnetic eddy viscosity leads to transport of angular momentum and may be
of importance to zonal flows in astrophysical domains such as the interior of

data embedding (DE) methods of N-D data into 2-D (3-D) visually perceptible
space (e.g., based on t-SNE concept) are too demanding computationally to be
efficiently employed for interactive data analytics of large and

visualization of high-dimensional data tool), which radically outperforms the
modern data-embedding algorithms in both computational and memory loads, while
retaining high quality of N-D data embedding in 2-D (3-D). We show that DE
problem is equivalent to the nearest neighbor nn-graph visualization, where
only indices of a few nearest neighbors of each data sample has to be known,
and binary distance between data samples -- 0 to the nearest and 1 to the other
samples -- is defined. These improvements reduce the time-complexity and memory
load from O(M log M) to O(M), and ensure minimal O(M) proportionality
coefficient as well. We demonstrate high efficiency, quality and robustness of
ivhd on popular benchmark datasets such as MNIST, 20NG, NORB and RCV1.

By reanalyzing the available data, we confirmed the previously reported high

horizontal. In order to understand how such a fragile material survived, we
applied three different models of meteoroid atmospheric fragmentation to the
detailed bolide light curve obtained by radiometers located in Czech Republic.
The Maribo meteoroid was found to be quite inhomogeneous with different parts
fragmenting at different dynamic pressures. While 30 - 40% of the (2000 +/-
1000) kg entry mass was destroyed already at 0.02 MPa, another 25 - 40%,
according to different models, survived without fragmentation until relatively
large dynamic pressures of 3 - 5 MPa. These pressures are only slightly lower
than the measured tensile strengths of hydrated carbonaceous chondrite (CC)
meteorites and are comparable with usual atmospheric fragmentation pressures of
ordinary chondritic (OC) meteoroids. While internal cracks weaken OC meteoroids
in comparison with meteorites, this effects seems to be absent in CC, enabling
meteorite delivery even at high speeds, though in the form of only small
fragments.

neither a scenario where the hypernuclei are produced after capture of a

$^9$Be nuclei in the target material can produce a sufficient amount of such

decays of the $_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{4}$n may be responsible for the observed

$\pi^-$ branching ratio of 50 % in a statistical multifragmentation model
allows to describe the E906 data remarkably well. On the other hand, a bound
$^{3}_{\Lambda}$n nucleus would cause a striking structure in the momentum

leveraging abundant data, the proposed data-driven approach can help us to
overcome the challenges and make more informed decisions. In our approach, a
semi-black-box model is built to forecast the dynamic market response and an
efficient optimization method is proposed to solve the complex allocation task.
First, the response in each market-segment is forecasted by exploring
historical data through a semi-black-box model, where the capability of logit
demand curve is enhanced by neural networks. The response model reveals
relationship between sales and marketing cost. Based on the learned model,
budget allocation is then formulated as an optimization problem, and we design
efficient algorithms to solve it in both continuous and discrete settings.
Several kinds of business constraints are supported in one unified optimization
paradigm, including cost upper bound, profit lower bound, or ROI lower bound.
The proposed framework is easy to implement and readily to handle large-scale
problems. It has been successfully applied to many scenarios in Alibaba Group.
The results of both offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate its
effectiveness.

Capella ({\alpha} Aur) is one of the few binaries in the sky with
two cool giant stars. With spectral types of G8III and G0III, the two
components appear at different but distinct stages in their evolution. The G0
secondary star is a Hertzsprung-gap giant, and the G8 primary star is thought
to be a clump giant. Aims. We present a new measure of the carbon 12 C/ 13 C
isotope ratio of the primary component of Capella using high-resolution R
$\approx$250 000 spectra obtained with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and
Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) with both the Vatican Advanced Technology
Telescope (VATT) and the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Methods.
Signal-to-noise ratios of up to 2 700 were obtained by averaging nightly
spectra. These average spectra were used to disentangle the two binary
components. The isotope ratio was derived with the use of spectrum synthesis
from the CN lines at 8004 {\AA}. Results. We found that the 12 C/ 13 C ratio of
the primary component of Capella is 17.8$\pm$1.9. Our measurement precision is
now primarily limited by the spectral-line data and by the grid-step size of
the model atmospheres rather than the data. The separated spectrum of the
secondary component does not show distinguishable 12 CN and 13 CN lines because
of its v sin i and higher temperature. Conclusions. Our new 12 C/ 13 C value is
significantly lower than the previous value of 27$\pm$4 but now agrees better
with the recent model prediction of 18.8 - 20.7.

The Sun is an active star and the source of the largest explosions
in the solar system, such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Flares
and CMEs are powerful particle accelerators that can generate radio emission
through various emission mechanisms. Aims. CMEs are often accompanied by Type
IV radio bursts that are observed as continuum emission in dynamic spectra at
decimetric and metric wavelengths, but their emission mechanism can vary from
event to event. Here, we aim to determine the emission mechanism of a complex
Type IV burst that accompanied the flare and CME on 22 September 2011. Methods.
We used radio imaging from the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph, spectroscopic data
from the e-Callisto network, ARTEMIS, Ondrejov, and Phoenix3 spectrometers
combined with extreme-ultraviolet observations from NASA's Solar Dynamic
Observatory to analyse the Type IV radio burst and determine its emission
mechanism. Results. We show that the emission mechanism of the Type IV radio
burst changes over time. We identified two components in the Type IV radio
burst: an earlier stationary Type IV showing gyro-synchrotron behaviour, and a
later moving Type IV burst covering the same frequency band. This second
component has a coherent emission mechanism. Fundamental plasma emission and
the electroncyclotron maser emission are further investigated as possible
emission mechanisms for the generation of the moving Type IV burst.
Conclusions. Type IV bursts are therefore complex radio bursts, where multiple
emission mechanisms can contribute to the generation of the wide-band continuum
observed in dynamic spectra. Imaging spectroscopy over a wide frequency band is
necessary to determine the emission mechanisms of Type IV bursts that are
observed in dynamic spectra.

much attention lately. Such explorations on Riemannian manifolds, on the other
hand, are relatively new, limited, and challenging. This is because of the
intrinsic non-linear structure of the underlying manifold and the absence of a
canonical coordinate system. In machine learning applications, however, most
manifolds of interest are represented as matrices with notions of row and
column subspaces. In addition, the implicit manifold-related constraints may
also lie on such subspaces. For example, the Grassmann manifold is the set of
column subspaces. To this end, such a rich structure should not be lost by
transforming matrices to just a stack of vectors while developing optimization
algorithms on manifolds. We propose novel stochastic gradient algorithms for
problems on Riemannian matrix manifolds by adapting the row and column
subspaces of gradients. Our algorithms are provably convergent and they achieve
the convergence rate of order $\mathcal{O}(\log (T)/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is
the number of iterations. Our experiments illustrate the efficacy of the

limits of the laws of thermodynamics from a quantum mechanical microscopic
approach. In this scenario, thermodynamic processes with no heat exchange,
namely, adiabatic transformations, can be implemented through quantum
evolutions in closed systems, even though the notion of a closed system is
always an idealization and approximation. Here, we begin by theoretically
discussing thermodynamic adiabatic processes in open quantum systems, which
evolve non-unitarily under decoherence due to its interaction with its
surrounding environment. From a general approach for adiabatic non-unitary
evolution, we establish heat and work in terms of the underlying Liouville
superoperator governing the quantum dynamics. As a consequence, we derive the
conditions that an adiabatic open-system quantum dynamics implies in the
absence of heat exchange, providing a connection between quantum and thermal
adiabaticity. Moreover, we determine families of decohering systems exhibiting
the same maximal heat exchange, which imply in classes of thermodynamic
adiabaticity in open systems. We then approach the problem experimentally using
a hyperfine energy-level quantum bit of an Ytterbium $^{171}$Yb$^+$ trapped
ion, which provides a work substance for thermodynamic processes, allowing for
the analysis of heat and internal energy throughout a controllable engineered

It focuses on the family of randomization techniques that consist in injecting
noise in the network at inference time. These techniques have proven effective
in many contexts, but lack theoretical arguments. We close this gap by
presenting a theoretical analysis of these approaches, hence explaining why
they perform well in practice. More precisely, we make two new contributions.
The first one relates the randomization rate to robustness to adversarial
attacks. This result applies for the general family of exponential
distributions, and thus extends and unifies the previous approaches. The second
contribution consists in devising a new upper bound on the adversarial
generalization gap of randomized neural networks. We support our theoretical
claims with a set of experiments.

requirements, which makes energy-efficient inference a challenging task. In
this paper, we perform an extensive analysis to demonstrate their key
limitations due to intense memory accesses and large on-chip memory
requirements. To enable efficient CaspuleNet inference accelerators, we propose
a specialized on-chip memory hierarchy which minimizes the off-chip memory
accesses, while efficiently feeding the data to the accelerator. We analyze the
on-chip memory requirements for each memory component of the architecture. By
leveraging this analysis, we propose a methodology to explore different on-chip
memory designs and a power-gating technique to further reduce the energy
consumption, depending upon the utilization across different operations of a
CapsuleNet. Our memory designs can significantly reduce the energy consumption
of the on-chip memory by up to 86%, when compared to a state-of-the-art memory

contributor in the power breakdown of the CapsuleNet accelerator, as we will
also show in our analyses, the proposed memory design can effectively reduce

systems of linear algebraic equations, while preserving the optimal
approximation order of the underlying finite element spaces. The specific goal
of this work is to present the implementation and performance of the method on

  Rate and Spectro-astrometric Analysis",,,"10.1093/mnras/stz280",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although advances in exoplanet detection techniques have seen an increase in
discoveries, observing a planet in the earliest stages of formation still
remains a difficult task. Here four epochs of spectra of the transitional disk
object T Cha are analysed to determine whether spectro-astrometry can be used
to detect a signal from its proposed protoplanet, T Cha b. The unique
properties of T Cha are also further constrained. H{\alpha} and [O I]{\lambda}
6300, the most prominent lines, were analysed using spectro-astrometry.
H{\alpha} being a direct accretion tracer is the target for the T Cha b
detection while [O I]{\lambda} 6300 is considered to be an indirect tracer of
accretion. [O I]{\lambda} 6300 is classified as a broad low velocity component
(BC LVC). The mass accretion rate was derived for all epochs using new [O
I]{\lambda} 6300 LVC relationships and the H{\alpha} line luminosity. It is
shown that a wind is the likely origin of the [O I]{\lambda} 6300 line and that
the [O I]{\lambda} 6300 line serves as a better accretion tracer than H{\alpha}
in this case. From the comparison between M acc([OI]) and M acc(H{\alpha}) it
is concluded that T Cha is not an intrinsically weak accretor but rather that a
significant proportion of the H{\alpha} emission tracing accretion is obscured.
T Cha b is not detected in the spectro-astrometric analysis yet a detection
limit of 0.5 mas is derived. The analysis in this case was hampered by
spectro-astrometric artefacts and by the unique properties of T Cha. While it
seems that spectro-astrometry as a means of detecting exoplanets in TDs can be
challenging it can be used to put an limit on the strength of the H{\alpha}
emission from accreting planetary companions and thus can have an important
input into the planning of high angular resolution observations.

using temperature profiles retrieved from Cassini Composite Infrared
Spectrometer (CIRS) data and wind profiles obtained from Cassini's Imaging

vorticity maps are very similar at all the studied epochs, showing positive
vorticities at the north and negative at the south, indicative of the dominance
of the Coriolis parameter 2${\Omega}sin{\phi}$ at all latitudes, except near
the pole. The meridional gradients of the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity
show that dynamical instabilities, mainly due to the barotropic term, could
develop at the flanks of the Hexagon at 78{\deg}N, the jet at 73.9{\deg}S and
on the equatorward flank of both polar jets. There are no differences in
potential vorticity gradients between the two hemispheres that could explain
why a hexagon forms in the north and not in the south. No seasonal variability
of the potential vorticity and its meridional gradient has been found, despite
significant changes in the atmospheric temperatures over time.

The properties of the accretion flow surrounding the supermassive
central black hole of the Galaxy, Sgr A*, will be scrutinized by the
new-generation instrument GRAVITY and the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
Developing fast, robust, and simple models of such flows is thus important and
very timely. Aims. We want to model the quiescent emission of Sgr A* from radio
to mid-infrared by considering a magnetized compact torus and an extended jet.
Results. We find perfect spectral fit both for face-on and edge-on views. These
best fits give parameters values very close to that found by the most recent
numerical simulations, which are much more complex than our model. The
intrinsic radio size of Sgr A* is found to be in reasonable agreement with the
centimetric observed constraints. Our best-fit infrared spectral index is in
perfect agreement with the latest constraints. Our emission region at 1.3 mm,
although larger than the Doeleman et al. (2008) Gaussian best-fit, does contain
bright features at the 40 microarcsec scale. EHT-reconstructed images show that
torus/jet-specific features persist after the reconstruction procedure, and
that these features are sensitive to inclination. Conclusions. The main
interest of our model is to give a simple and fast model of the quiescent state
of Sgr A*, which gives extremely similar results as compared to
state-of-the-art numerical simulations. Our model is easy to use and we publish
all the material necessary to reproduce our spectra and images, so that anyone
interested can use our results rather straightforwardly. We hope that such a
public tool can be useful in the context of the recent and near-future GRAVITY
and EHT results. Our model can in particular be easily used to test alternative
compact objects models, or alternative gravity theories. The main limitation of
our model is that we do not yet treat the X-ray emission.

rise to regions with strong attractive static interaction in the minimal

The temporal interaction exhibits generic damped oscillations in all compounds,

decoding (BDD) and hard decisions. In this paper, a novel decoding algorithm is
proposed, which partially uses soft information from the channel. The proposed
algorithm is based on marking certain number of highly reliable and highly
unreliable bits. These marked bits are used to improve the
miscorrection-detection capability of the SCC decoder and the error-correcting
capability of BDD. For SCCs with $2$-error-correcting
Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem component codes, our algorithm improves upon
standard SCC decoding by up to $0.30$~dB at a bit-error rate (BER) of
$10^{-7}$. The proposed algorithm is shown to achieve almost half of the gain
achievable by an idealized decoder with this structure. A complexity analysis
based on the number of additional calls to the component BDD decoder shows that
the relative complexity increase is only around $4\%$ at a BER of $10^{-4}$.
This additional complexity is shown to decrease as the channel quality
improves. Our algorithm is also extended (with minor modifications) to product
codes. The simulation results show that in this case, the algorithm offers
gains of up to $0.44$~dB at a BER of $10^{-8}$.

stellar binary systems where a companion spirals-in inside the envelope of a

jets supernova (CEJSN), a white dwarf (WD) that merges with the core to form a
massive WD that later might explode as a Type Ia supernova (the core degenerate

be a core collapse supernova (CCSN) of a blue giant, a CCSN of type IIb or of

pulsar reported by MAGIC and VERITAS collaborations demands a substantial
revision of existing models of particle acceleration in the pulsar
magnetosphere. In this regard model independent restrictions on the possible
production site of the VHE photons become an important issue. In this paper, we
consider limitations imposed by the process of conversion of VHE gamma rays
into $e^{\pm}$ pairs in the magnetic field of the pulsar magnetosphere. Photons
with energies exceeding 1~TeV are effectively absorbed even at large distances
from the surface of the neutron star. Our calculations of magnetic absorption
in the force-free magnetosphere show that the twisting of the magnetic field
due to the pulsar rotation makes the magnetosphere more transparent compared to
the dipole magnetosphere. The gamma-ray absorption appears stronger for photons
emitted in the direction of rotation than in the opposite direction. There is a
small angular cone inside which the magnetosphere is relatively transparent and
photons with energy $1.5$~TeV can escape from distances beyond $0.1$~light
cylinder radius ($R_{\rm{lc}}$). The emission surface from where photons can be
emitted in the observer's direction further restricts the sites of VHE
gamma-ray production. For the observation angle $57^{\circ}$ relative to the
Crab pulsar axis of rotation and the orthogonal rotation, the emission surface
in the open field line region is located as close as $0.4\,R_{\rm{lc}}$ from
the stellar surface for a dipole magnetic field, and $0.1\,R_{\rm{lc}}$ for a
force-free magnetic field.

velocity amplitude of $13.8 \pm 3.2$ km/s, which agrees at the 1 $\sigma$ level
with the predicted value of $17.6 \pm 1.0$ km/s based on eclipse-derived system

Huygens' dipole may be utilized for unidirectional coupling to waveguide modes
that propagate transverse to the excitation beam. We study two configurations
of a Huygens' dipole -- longitudinal electric and transverse magnetic dipole
moments or vice versa. We experimentally show that only the radially polarized
emission of the first and azimuthally polarized emission of the second
configuration are directional in the far-field. This polarization selectivity
implies that directional excitation of either TM or TE waveguide modes is
possible. Applying this concept to a single nanoantenna excited with structured
light, we are able to experimentally achieve scattering directivities of around
23 dB and 18 dB in TM and TE modes, respectively. This strong directivity paves
the way for tunable polarization-controlled nanoscale light routing and
applications in optical metrology, localization microscopy and on-chip optical
devices.

the resonant dielectronic recombination (DR) process in highly-charged argon

NOMAD was used to create synthetic spectra for comparison with both our EBIT

Plasma Emission Code (APEC) used in the Bulbul et al. (2014) work. Excellent
agreement was found between the NOMAD and EBIT spectra, providing a high level
of confidence in the atomic data used. Comparison of the NOMAD and APEC spectra
revealed a number of missing features in the AtomDB database near the
unidentified line. At an electron temperature of $T_e$ = 1.72 keV, the
inclusion of the missing lines in AtomDB increases the total flux in the 3.5

Canonical Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is induced by a steady shock and
impulsive acceleration, whereas in realistic environments the acceleration is
usually variable. This work focuses on RMI induced by acceleration with a
power-law time-dependence, and applies group theory to solve the classical
problem. For early-time dynamics, we find the dependence of RMI growth-rate on
the initial conditions and show it is free from the acceleration parameters.
For late time dynamics, we find a continuous family of regular asymptotic
solutions, including their curvature, velocity, Fourier amplitudes, and
interfacial shear, and we study the solutions stability. For each of the
solutions, the interface dynamics is directly linked to the interfacial shear,
and the non-equilibrium velocity field has intense fluid motion near the
interface and effectively no motion in the bulk. The quasi-invariance of the
fastest stable solution suggests that nonlinear coherent dynamics in RMI is
characterized by two macroscopic length-scales - the wavelength and the
amplitude, in excellent agreement with observations. We elaborate new theory
benchmarks for experiments and simulations, and put forward a hypothesis on the
role of viscous effects in interfacial nonlinear RMI.

molecular-dynamics simulation. For head-on collisions of nanoparticles with
radii $R =$ 1.4 nm, $R =$ 5.2 nm, and $R =$ 11 nm, sticking was observed at all
simulated velocities. The results were compared to the description provided by
the JKR model. It was found that strong disagreement exists between the
predictions of JKR and the results of the molecular-dynamics simulation due to
the presence of additional dissipative processes which strengthen sticking
behavior. First, it is demonstrated that very strong dissipation into atomic
vibrations occurs during the collision. The dissipation is strong enough to
prevent significant rebound of the nanoparticles. Additionally, the morphology
of the adhered nanoparticles includes a ``neck'' that increases in radius with
increasing collision velocity which results in amplified irreversibility and
adhesion. Approximate calculation of the stress during the collision indicates
that stress levels are well above typical yield stress values even for low
velocity collisions, consistent with the observation of plastic deformation.
Furthermore, it is shown that for nanoparticles with $R \leq$ 11 nm, the
dominance of surface attraction results in large effective collision velocities
and plastic deformation. By obtaining scaling relations for computed
quantities, predictions are made for larger nanoparticles up to $R$ $\sim$ 1

Higgs doublet model, for which one can analyze the numerical results in terms
of available analytic expressions. After drawing various conclusions about the
fine-tuning measures, we investigate a particular left-right symmetric model
for which it has been claimed that already at tree-level it suffers from a high
amount of fine-tuning. We will reach a different conclusion, although
left-right symmetric models may require a modest amount of fine-tuning if
phenomenological constraints are imposed. Our analysis shows that the two
considered measures can probe different aspects of fine-tuning and are both
useful if applied and interpreted in the appropriate way.

the difference in arrival times for the separate images. These measurements
provide precise tests of lens models or constraints on the Hubble constant and
other cosmological parameters that are independent of the local distance

microlensing. We describe simulations using the package that suggest a
before-peak detection of the leading image enables a more accurate and precise
time delay measurement (by ~1 and ~2 days, respectively), when compared to an
after-peak detection. We also conclude that fitting the effects of microlensing

odd-symplectic forms (also known as Hamiltonian structures) and to establish it
in some basic cases. Let $\Omega$ be an odd-symplectic form on an oriented
closed manifold $\Sigma$ of odd dimension. We say that $\Omega$ is Zoll if the
trajectories of the flow given by $\Omega$ are the orbits of a free
$S^1$-action. After defining the volume of $\Omega$ and the action of its
periodic orbits, we prove that the volume and the action satisfy a polynomial
equation, provided $\Omega$ is Zoll. This builds the equality case of a
conjectural systolic inequality for odd-symplectic forms close to a Zoll one.
We prove the conjecture when the $S^1$-action yields a flat $S^1$-bundle or
$\Omega$ is quasi-autonomous. In particular the conjecture is established in
dimension three.
  This new inequality recovers the contact systolic inequality as well as the
inequality between the minimal action and the Calabi invariant for Hamiltonian
isotopies $C^1$-close to the identity on a closed symplectic manifold.
Applications to the study of periodic magnetic geodesics on closed orientable

analyzed here a database of 125 infrastructure networks, roads (RN); urban
drainage networks (UDN); water distribution networks (WDN), in 52 global
cities, serving populations ranging from 1,000 to 9,000,000. For all
infrastructure networks, the node-degree distributions, p(k), derived using
undirected, dual-mapped graphs, fit Pareto distributions. Variance around mean
gamma reduces substantially as network size increases. Convergence of
functional topology of these urban infrastructure networks suggests that their
co-evolution results from similar generative mechanisms. Analysis of growing
UDNs over non-concurrent 40 year periods in three cities suggests the likely
generative process to be partial preferential attachment under geospatial

role in physics and materials science. While they can in principle be
parametrized using regression and feature selection approaches, the convergence
behavior of these techniques, in particular with respect to thermodynamic
properties is not well understood. Here, we therefore analyze the efficacy and
efficiency of several state-of-the-art regression and feature selection
methods, in particular in the context of FC extraction and the prediction of
different thermodynamic properties. Generic feature selection algorithms such
as recursive feature elimination with ordinary least-squares (OLS), automatic
relevance determination regression, and the adaptive least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator can yield physically sound models for systems with a
modest number of degrees of freedom. For large unit cells with low symmetry
and/or high-order expansions they come, however, with a non-negligible
computational cost that can be more than two orders of magnitude higher than
that of OLS. In such cases, OLS with cutoff selection provides a viable route
as demonstrated here for both second-order FCs in large low-symmetry unit cells
and high-order FCs in low-symmetry systems. While regression techniques are
thus very powerful, they require well-tuned protocols. Here, the present work
establishes guidelines for the design of protocols that are readily usable,
e.g., in high-throughput and materials discovery schemes. Since the underlying
algorithms are not specific to FC construction, the general conclusions drawn
here also have a bearing on the construction of other linear models in physics

Gaussian processes is investigated. The theory of large deviations for Gaussian
processes is extended to the wider class of random processes -- the
conditionally Gaussian processes. The estimates of level crossing probability
for such processes are given as an application.

  with dynamic structure",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Timely and high-resolution estimates of the home locations of a sufficiently
large subset of the population are critical for effective disaster response and
public health intervention, but this is still an open problem. Conventional
data sources, such as census and surveys, have a substantial time lag and
cannot capture seasonal trends. Recently, social media data has been exploited
to address this problem by leveraging its large user-base and real-time nature.
However, inherent sparsity and noise, along with large estimation uncertainty
in home locations, have limited their effectiveness. Consequently, much of
previous research has aimed only at a coarse spatial resolution, with accuracy
being limited for high-resolution methods. In this paper, we develop a
deep-learning solution that uses a two-phase dynamic structure to deal with
sparse and noisy social media data. In the first phase, high recall is achieved
using a random forest, producing more balanced home location candidates. Then
two deep neural networks are used to detect home locations with high accuracy.
We obtained over 90% accuracy for large subsets on a commonly used dataset.
Compared to other high-resolution methods, our approach yields up to 60% error
reduction by reducing high-resolution home prediction error from over 21% to
less than 8%. Systematic comparisons show that our method gives the highest
accuracy both for the entire sample and for subsets. Evaluation on a real-world
public health problem further validates the effectiveness of our approach.

compounds is a major challenge in the drug discovery process. WideDTA is a
deep-learning based prediction model that employs chemical and biological
textual sequence information to predict binding affinity.
  Results: WideDTA uses four text-based information sources, namely the protein
sequence, ligand SMILES, protein domains and motifs, and maximum common
substructure words to predict binding affinity. WideDTA outperformed one of the
state of the art deep learning methods for drug-target binding affinity
prediction, DeepDTA on the KIBA dataset with a statistical significance. This
indicates that the word-based sequence representation adapted by WideDTA is a
promising alternative to the character-based sequence representation approach
in deep learning models for binding affinity prediction, such as the one used
in DeepDTA. In addition, the results showed that, given the protein sequence
and ligand SMILES, the inclusion of protein domain and motif information as
well as ligand maximum common substructure words do not provide additional
useful information for the deep learning model. Interestingly, however, using
only domain and motif information to represent proteins achieved similar
performance to using the full protein sequence, suggesting that important
binding relevant information is contained within the protein motifs and
domains.

Unlike existing methods, such as LLE, ISOMAP, which attempt to unfold the true
manifold in the low dimensional space, our algorithm tries to preserve the
nonlinear structure of the manifold, and shows how the manifold is folded in
the high dimensional space. We call this method Tangent Distance Preserving
Mapping (TDPM). TDPM uses tangent distance instead of geodesic distance, and
then applies MDS to the tangent distance matrix to map the manifold into a low
dimensional space in which we can get its nonlinear structure.

The state-of-the-art deep learning framework is employed instead of using
traditional signal processing. In preparing the radar training data, the ground
truth of an object orientation in 3D space is provided by conducting image
analysis, of which the images are obtained through a coupled camera to the
radar device. To ensure successful training of a fully convolutional network
(FCN), we propose a normalization method, which is found to be essential to be
applied to the radar signal before feeding into the neural network. The system
after proper training is able to first detect the presence of an object in an
environment. If it does, the system then further produces an estimation of its
3D position. Experimental results show that the proposed system can be
successfully trained and employed for detecting a car and further estimating
its 3D position in a noisy environment.

generate synthetic images from text. Despite significant advances, most current
state-of-the-art algorithms are regular-grid region based; when attention is
used, it is mainly applied between individual regular-grid regions and a word.
These approaches are sufficient to generate images that contain a single object
in its foreground, such as a ""bird"" or ""flower"". However, natural languages
often involve complex foreground objects and the background may also constitute
a variable portion of the generated image. Therefore, the regular-grid based
image attention weights may not necessarily concentrate on the intended
foreground region(s), which in turn, results in an unnatural looking image.
Additionally, individual words such as ""a"", ""blue"" and ""shirt"" do not
necessarily provide a full visual context unless they are applied together. For
this reason, in our paper, we proposed a novel method in which we introduced an
additional set of attentions between true-grid regions and word phrases. The
true-grid region is derived using a set of auxiliary bounding boxes. These
auxiliary bounding boxes serve as superior location indicators to where the
alignment and attention should be drawn with the word phrases. Word phrases are
derived from analysing Part-of-Speech (POS) results. We perform experiments on
this novel network architecture using the Microsoft Common Objects in Context
(MSCOCO) dataset and the model generates $256 \times 256$ conditioned on a
short sentence description. Our proposed approach is capable of generating more
realistic images compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms.

find the same algebraic expressions and singularities for the affine
connections on the sphere $S^2$, which Dirac found for the U(1) gauge field of
magnetic monopoles. Since spheres have no singularities, it is obvious, that
these singularities are due to the set of fields which are used to describe the
geometry of $S^2$. As there are descriptions of the geometry of spheres without
any singularities, we indicate that it would be preferable to use singularity
free descriptions of magnetic and also electric monopoles.

solutions for various applications in flexible electronics and bioengineering.
Multimaterial thermal drawing, in particular, has attracted strong interest for
its ability to generate fibers with complex architectures. Thus far, however,
the understanding of its fluid dynamics has only been applied to single
material preforms for which higher order effects, such as the radial dependency
of the axial velocity, could be neglected. With complex multimaterial preforms,
such effects must be taken into account, as they can affect the architecture
and the functional properties of the resulting fiber device. Here, we propose a
versatile model of the thermal drawing of fibers, which takes into account a
radially varying axial velocity. Unlike the commonly used cross section
averaged approach, our model is capable of predicting radial variations of
functional properties caused by the deformation during drawing. This is
demonstrated for two effects observed, namely, by unraveling the deformation of
initially straight, transversal lines in the preform and the dependence on the
draw ratio and radial position of the in-fiber electrical conductivity of
polymer nanocomposites, an important class of materials for emerging fiber
devices. This work sets a thus far missing theoretical and practical
understanding of multimaterial fiber processing to better engineer advanced
fibers and textiles for sensing, health care, robotics, or bioengineering
applications.
