  High-dimensional Heterogeneous Data",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evidence-based decision making often relies on meta-analyzing multiple
studies, which enables more precise estimation and investigation of
generalizability. Integrative analysis of multiple heterogeneous studies is,
however, highly challenging in the ultra high dimensional setting. The
challenge is even more pronounced when the individual level data cannot be
shared across studies, known as DataSHIELD constraint (Wolfson et al., 2010).
Under sparse regression models that are assumed to be similar yet not identical
across studies, we propose in this paper a novel integrative estimation
procedure for data-Shielding High-dimensional Integrative Regression (SHIR).
SHIR protects individual data through summary-statistics-based integrating
procedure, accommodates between study heterogeneity in both the covariate
distribution and model parameters, and attains consistent variable selection.
Theoretically, SHIR is statistically more efficient than the existing
distributed approaches that integrate debiased LASSO estimators from the local
sites. Furthermore, the estimation error incurred by aggregating derived data
is negligible compared to the statistical minimax rate and SHIR is shown to be
asymptotically equivalent in estimation to the ideal estimator obtained by
sharing all data. The finite-sample performance of our method is studied and
compared with existing approaches via extensive simulation settings. We further
illustrate the utility of SHIR to derive phenotyping algorithms for coronary
artery disease using electronic health records data from multiple chronic
disease cohorts.

approach the same temperature, unless a heat source (or sink) cherishes a
persistent flow of heat. Accordingly, in a well-isolated apartment flat, most
items are at a similar temperature. This is a general consequence of
equilibrium thermodynamics, requiring coexisting phases to have identical
temperatures. Opposing this generic situation, here we identify a system
showing different temperatures in coexisting phases, which are separated from
each other by a sharp and persistent temperature gradient. Thermodynamically,
such a ""hot"" and a ""cold"" phase are allowed to coexist, as the system we
consider comprises ""active"" particles which self-propel relative to their
environment and are thus intrinsically out-of-equilibrium. Although these
microparticles are well known to spontaneously phase-separate into a liquid-
and a gas-like state, different kinetic temperatures in coexisting phases occur
if and only if inertia is introduced, which is neglected in standard models
describing active particles. Our results, therefore, exemplify a novel route to
use active particles to create a self-sustained temperature gradient across
coexisting phases, a phenomenon, which is fundamentally beyond equilibrium
physics.

maintaining the logic related to flow and congestion control, retransmissions

possible to test QUIC's performance and understand design choices and possible

space mission planning and scheduling, where problem domains are modelled as
systems made of a number of independent but interacting components, whose
behaviour over time, the timelines, is governed by a set of temporal
constraints. This approach is different from the action-based perspective of
common PDDL-like planning languages. Timeline-based systems have been
successfully deployed in a number of space missions and other domains. However,
despite this practical success, a thorough theoretical understanding of the
paradigm was missing.
  This thesis fills this gap, providing the first detailed account of formal
and computational properties of the timeline-based approach to planning. In
particular, we show that a particularly restricted variant of the formalism is
already expressive enough to compactly capture action-based temporal planning
problems. Then, finding a solution plan for a timeline-based planning problem
is proved to be EXPSPACE-complete.
  Then, we study the problem of timeline-based planning with uncertainty, that
include external components whose behaviour is not under the control of the
planned system. We identify a few issues in the state-of-the-art approach based
on flexible plans, proposing timeline-based games, a more general
game-theoretic formulation of the problem, that addresses those issues. We show
that winning strategies for such games can be found in doubly-exponential time.
  Then, we study the expressiveness of the formalism from a logic point of
view, showing that (most of) timeline-based planning problems can be captured
by Bounded TPTL with Past, a fragment of TPTL+P that, unlike the latter, keeps
an EXPSPACE satisfiability problem. The logic is introduced and its
satisfiabilty problem is solved by extending a recent one-pass tree-shaped
tableau method for LTL.

propagating screened variables between iterations of MM. In addition to improve
efficiency of solvers, we also provide guarantees that the inner solver is able
to identify the zeros components of its critical point in finite time. Our
experimental analysis illustrates the significant computational gain brought by
the new screening rule compared to classical coordinate-descent or proximal

introduces our MATLAB package, Longitudinal Image Sequence Analysis (LISA), as
a one-stop ensemble of image processing and analysis tool for comparing a
general class of images from either different times, sessions, or subjects.
Given two contrasting sequences of images, the image processing in LISA starts
with selecting a region of interest in two representative images, followed by
automatic or manual segmentation and registration. Automatic segmentation
de-noises an image using a mixture of Gaussian distributions of the pixel
intensity values, while manual segmentation applies a user-chosen intensity
cut-off value to filter out noises. Automatic registration aligns the
contrasting images based on a mid-line regression whereas manual registration
lines up the images along a reference line formed by two user-selected points.
The processed images are then rendered for simultaneous statistical comparisons
to generate D, S, T, and P-maps. The D map represents a curated difference of
contrasting images, the S map is the non-parametrically smoothed differences,
the T map presents the variance-adjusted, smoothed differences, and the P-map
provides multiplicity-controlled p-values. These maps reveal the regions with
significant differences due to either longitudinal, subject-specific, or
treatment changes. A user can skip the image processing step to dive directly
into the statistical analysis step if the images have already been processed.
Hence, LISA offers flexibility in applying other image pre-processing tools.
LISA also has a parallel computing option for high definition images.

subsequent processes, in particular multi-photon excitations, appear at a time

Ising model dates back to 1963 for non conserved order parameter (NCOP) and to
1991 for conserved order parameter (COP). The case of long range interactions
$J(r)$ has been widely studied at equilibrium but their effect on relaxation is
a much less investigated field. Here we make a detailed numerical and
analytical study of both cases, NCOP and COP. Many results are valid for any
positive, decreasing coupling $J(r)$, but we focus specifically on the
exponential case, $J_{exp}(r)=e^{-r/R}$ with varying $R>0$, and on the
integrable power law case, $J_{pow}(r) =1/r^{1+\sigma}$ with $\sigma > 0$. We
find that the {\it asymptotic} growth law $L(t)$ is the usual algebraic one,
$L(t)\sim t^{1/z}$, of the corresponding model with nearest neighborg
interaction ($z_{NCOP}=2$ and $z_{COP}=3$) for all models except $J_{pow}$ for
small $\sigma$: in the non conserved case when $\sigma\le 1$
($z_{NCOP}=\sigma+1$) and in the conserved case when $\sigma\to 0^+$
($z_{COP}=4\beta+3$, where $\beta=1/T$ is the inverse of the absolute
temperature). The models with space decaying interactions also differ markedly
from the ones with nearest neighbors due to the presence of many long-lasting
preasymptotic regimes, such as an exponential mean-field behavior with
$L(t)\sim e^{t}$, a ballistic one with $L(t)\sim t$, a slow (logarithmic)
behavior $L(t)\sim \ln t$ and one with $L(t)\sim t^{1/\sigma+1}$. All these
regimes and their validity ranges have been found analytically and verified in
numerical simulations. Our results show that the main effect of the
conservation law is a strong slowdown of COP dynamics if interactions have an
extended range. Finally, we compare the Ising model at hand with continuum
approaches based on a Ginzburg-Landau free energy.

`works encrypted', taking encrypted inputs to encrypted outputs while data
remains in encrypted form throughout. It aims to secure user data against
possible insider attacks by the operator and operating system (who do not know
the user's encryption key and cannot access it in the processor). Formally
`obfuscating' compilation for encrypted computing is such that on each
recompilation of the source code, machine code of the same structure is emitted
for which runtime traces also all have the same structure but each word beneath
the encryption differs from nominal with maximal possible entropy across
recompilations. That generates classic cryptographic semantic security for
data, relative to the security of the encryption, but it guarantees only single
words and an adversary has more than that on which to base decryption attempts.
This paper extends the existing integer-based technology to doubles, floats,

  Decadal Survey",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Dark Ages, probed by the redshifted 21-cm signal, is the ideal epoch for
a new rigorous test of the standard LCDM cosmological model. Divergences from
that model would indicate new physics, such as dark matter decay (heating) or
baryonic cooling beyond that expected from adiabatic expansion of the Universe.
In the early Universe, most of the baryonic matter was in the form of neutral
hydrogen (HI), detectable via its ground state's spin-flip transition. A
measurement of the redshifted 21-cm spectrum maps the history of the HI gas
through the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn and up to the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR). The Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES) recently
reported an absorption trough at 78 MHz (redshift z of 17), similar in
frequency to expectations for Cosmic Dawn, but about 3 times deeper than was
thought possible from standard cosmology and adiabatic cooling of HI.
Interactions between baryons and slightly-charged dark matter particles with
electron-like mass provide a potential explanation of this difference but other
cooling mechanisms are also being investigated to explain these results. The
Cosmic Dawn trough is affected by cosmology and the complex astrophysical
history of the first luminous objects. Another trough is expected during the
Dark Ages, prior to the formation of the first stars and thus determined
entirely by cosmological phenomena (including dark matter). Observations on or
in orbit above the Moon's farside can investigate this pristine epoch (15-40
MHz; z=100-35), which is inaccessible from Earth. A single cross-dipole antenna
or compact array can measure the amplitude of the 21-cm spectrum to the level
required to distinguish (at >5$\sigma$}) the standard cosmological model from
that of additional cooling derived from current EDGES results. This observation
constitutes a powerful, clean probe of exotic physics in the Dark Ages.

mobile crowd-learning services, where service providers rely on the user
community to voluntarily collect, report, and share real-time information for a
collection of scattered points of interest. A critical factor affecting the
future large-scale adoption of such mobile crowd-learning applications is the
freshness of the crowd-learned information, which can be measured by a metric
termed ``age-of-information'' (AoI). However, we show that the AoI of mobile
crowd-learning could be arbitrarily bad under selfish users' behaviors if the
system is poorly designed. This motivates us to design efficient reward
mechanisms to incentivize mobile users to report information in time, with the
goal of keeping the AoI and congestion level of each PoI low. Toward this end,
we consider a simple linear AoI-based reward mechanism and analyze its AoI and
congestion performances in terms of price of anarchy (PoA), which characterizes
the degradation of the system efficiency due to selfish behavior of users.
Remarkably, we show that the proposed mechanism achieves the optimal AoI
performance asymptotically in a deterministic scenario. Further, we prove that
the proposed mechanism achieves a bounded PoA in general stochastic cases, and
the bound only depends on system parameters. Particularly, when the service
rates of PoIs are symmetric in stochastic cases, the achieved PoA is
upper-bounded by $1/2$ asymptotically. Collectively, this work advances our
understanding of information freshness in mobile crowd-learning systems.

computational paradigm for the understanding of the structure of atomic nuclei.
While the shell model has been predominantly used in a phenomenological
context, there have been efforts stretching back over a half century to derive
shell model parameters based on a realistic interaction between nucleons. More
recently, several ab initio many-body methods---in particular many-body
perturbation theory, the no-core shell model, the in-medium similarity
renormalization group, and coupled cluster theory---have developed the
capability to provide effective shell model Hamiltonians. We provide an update
on the status of these methods and investigate the connections between them and
potential strengths and weaknesses, with a particular focus on the in-medium

to be an important ingredient in understanding the modifications needed in

benefits of deep learning and probabilistic modeling. SPNs offer unique
advantages to applications demanding exact probabilistic inference over
high-dimensional, noisy inputs. Yet, compared to convolutional neural nets,
they struggle with capturing complex spatial relationships in image data. To
alleviate this issue, we introduce Deep Generalized Convolutional Sum-Product
Networks (DGC-SPNs), which encode spatial features in a way similar to CNNs,
while preserving the validity of the probabilistic SPN model. As opposed to
existing SPN-based image representations, DGC-SPNs allow for overlapping
convolution patches through a novel parameterization of dilations and strides,
resulting in significantly improved feature coverage and feature resolution.
DGC-SPNs substantially outperform other SPN architectures across several visual
datasets and for both generative and discriminative tasks, including image
inpainting and classification. These contributions are reinforced by the first
simple, scalable, and GPU-optimized implementation of SPNs, integrated with the
widely used Keras/TensorFlow framework. The resulting model is fully
probabilistic and versatile, yet efficient and straightforward to apply in
practical applications in place of traditional deep nets.

bunches with increasingly high charge density are needed for producing
brilliant light at various wavelengths, from X-rays to terahertz. In such
conditions, interaction of electrons bunches with their own emitted
electromagnetic fields leads to instabilities and spontaneous formation of
complex spatial structures. Understanding these instabilities is therefore key
in most electron accelerators. However, investigations suffer from the lack of
non-destructive recording tools for electron bunch shapes. In storage rings,
most studies thus focus on the resulting emitted radiation. Here, we present
measurements of the electric field in the immediate vicinity of the electron
bunch in a storage ring, over many turns. For recording the ultrafast electric
field, we designed a photonic time-stretch analog-to-digital converter with
terasamples/second acquisition rate. We could thus observe the predicted link

machine learning tasks, especially for the nonsmooth problems. However, in some
machine learning problems such as the bandit model and the black-box learning
problem, proximal gradient method could fail because the explicit gradients of
these problems are difficult or infeasible to obtain. The gradient-free
(zeroth-order) method can address these problems because only the objective
function values are required in the optimization. Recently, the first
zeroth-order proximal stochastic algorithm was proposed to solve the nonconvex
nonsmooth problems. However, its convergence rate is $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$
for the nonconvex problems, which is significantly slower than the best
convergence rate $O(\frac{1}{T})$ of the zeroth-order stochastic algorithm,
where $T$ is the iteration number. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a
class of faster zeroth-order proximal stochastic methods with the variance
reduction techniques of SVRG and SAGA, which are denoted as ZO-ProxSVRG and
ZO-ProxSAGA, respectively. In theoretical analysis, we address the main
challenge that an unbiased estimate of the true gradient does not hold in the
zeroth-order case, which was required in previous theoretical analysis of both
SVRG and SAGA. Moreover, we prove that both ZO-ProxSVRG and ZO-ProxSAGA
algorithms have $O(\frac{1}{T})$ convergence rates. Finally, the experimental

where the new source overtakes the conventional component due to secondary
production. This interpretation is simple and attractive, but it is not unique.
The alternative possibility, that the positron flux is entirely of secondary
origin, remains viable. In such a scenario the spectral softening observed by
AMS for positrons is generated by energy loss effects, and a feature of
similar, but not identical structure should be also visible in the $e^-$
spectrum. Spectral features similar to both the hardening and softening of the
positron flux are in fact observed for electrons and call for a consistent
explanation. Precision measurements of the $e^+$ and $e^-$ spectra in the TeV
and multi--TeV energy range are crucial to clarify the problem.

number of antennas at the base station considerably increase the spectrum
efficiency by serving multiple users simultaneously without causing severe
interference. However, the advantage relies on the availability of the downlink
channel state information (CSI) of multiple users, which is still a challenge
in frequency-division-duplex transmission systems. This paper aims to solve
this problem by developing a full transceiver framework that includes downlink
channel training (or estimation), CSI feedback, and channel reconstruction
schemes. Our framework provides accurate reconstruction results for multiple
users with small amounts of training and feedback overhead. Specifically, we
first develop an enhanced Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (eNOMP)
algorithm to extract the frequency-independent parameters (i.e., downtilts,
azimuths, and delays) from the uplink. Then, by leveraging the information from
these frequency-independent parameters, we develop an efficient downlink
training scheme to estimate the downlink channel gains for multiple users. This
training scheme offers an acceptable estimation error rate of the gains with a
limited pilot amount. Numerical results verify the precision of the eNOMP
algorithm and demonstrate that the sum-rate performance of the system using the
reconstructed downlink channel can approach that of the system using perfect
CSI.

free-boundary dam problem posed in a heterogeneous media. More precisely, we
propose a generalized multiscale finite element (GMsFEM) method for the
heterogeneous dam problem. The motivation of using the GMsFEM approach comes
from the multiscale nature of the porous media due to its high-contrast
permeability. Thus, although we can classically formulate the free-boundary dam
problem as in the homogeneous case, a very high resolution will be needed by a
standard finite element approximation in order to obtain realistic results that
recover the multiscale nature. First, we introduce a fictitious time variable
which motivates a suitable time discretization that can be understood as a
fixed point iteration to the steady state solution, and we use a duality method
to deal with the involved multivalued nonlinear terms. Next, we compute
efficient approximations of the pressure and the saturation by using the
GMfsFEM method and we can identify the free boundary. More precisely, the
GMsGEM method provides numerical results that capture the behavior of the
solution due to the variations of the coefficient at the fine-resolution, by
just solving linear systems with size proportional to the number of coarse
blocks of a coarse-grid (that does not need to be adapted to the variations of
the coefficient). Finally, we present illustrative numerical results to
validate the proposed methodology.

supernova 2017eaw in NGC 6946, based on the pre-explosion images and early-time

with M$_{F814W}$ = $-$6.9 mag and m$_{F606W}$$-$ m$_{F814W}=$2.9$\pm$0.2 mag,
can be identified at the SN position in the pre-discovery Hubble Space
Telescope(HST) images taken in 2016. The observed spectral energy distribution
of this star, covering the wavelength of 0.6-2.0$\ \mathrm{\mu m}$, matches
that of an M4-type red supergiant (RSG) with a temperature of about 3550 K.
These results suggest that SN 2017eaw has a RSG progenitor with an initial mass
of 12$\pm$2 M$_\odot$. The absolute F814W-band magnitude of this progenitor
star is found to evolve from $-$7.2 mag in 2004 to $-$6.9 mag in 2016. Such a
dimming effect is, however, unpredicted for a RSG in its neon/oxygen burning
phase when its luminosity should modestly increase. The spectrum of SN 2017eaw
taken a few hours after discovery clearly shows a narrow H$_\alpha$ emission
feature blueshifted by $\sim$160 km s$^{-1}$. This narrow component disappeared
in the spectrum taken two days later, suggesting the presence of a
circumstellar material (CSM) shell (i.e., at a distance of
$<$2.1-4.3$\times$10$^{14}$ cm). Combining the inferred distance with the
expansion velocity of the CSM, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2017eaw
should have experienced violent mass loss at about 1-2 years prior to
explosion, perhaps invoked by pulsational envelop ejection. This mechanism may
help explain its luminosity decline in 2016 as well as the lack of detections
of RSGs with initial mass in the range of 17 M$_\odot<$ M $<$ 25 M$_\odot$ as
progenitors of SNe IIP.

  Controls",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emission control technologies installed on power plants are a key feature of
many air pollution regulations in the US. While such regulations are predicated
on the presumed relationships between emissions, ambient air pollution, and
human health, many of these relationships have never been empirically verified.
The goal of this paper is to develop new statistical methods to quantify these
relationships. We frame this problem as one of mediation analysis to evaluate
the extent to which the effect of a particular control technology on ambient
pollution is mediated through causal effects on power plant emissions. Since
power plants emit various compounds that contribute to ambient pollution, we
develop new methods for multiple intermediate variables that are measured
contemporaneously, may interact with one another, and may exhibit joint
mediating effects. Specifically, we propose new methods leveraging two related
frameworks for causal inference in the presence of mediating variables:
principal stratification and causal mediation analysis. We define principal
effects based on multiple mediators, and also introduce a new decomposition of
the total effect of an intervention on ambient pollution into the natural
direct effect and natural indirect effects for all combinations of mediators.
Both approaches are anchored to the same observed-data models, which we specify
with Bayesian nonparametric techniques. We provide assumptions for estimating
principal causal effects, then augment these with an additional assumption
required for causal mediation analysis. The two analyses, interpreted in
tandem, provide the first empirical investigation of the presumed causal
pathways that motivate important air quality regulatory policies.

independent tampering and joint tampering models for threshold secret sharing
(STOC18) and secret sharing with general access structure (CRYPTO18). The idea
of making secret sharing non-malleable received great attention and by now has
generated many papers exploring new frontiers in this topic, such as
multiple-time tampering and adding leakage resiliency to the one-shot tampering
model. Non-compartmentalized tampering model was first studied by Agrawal et.al
(CRYPTO15) for non-malleability against permutation composed with bit-wise
independent tampering, and shown useful in constructing non-malleable string
commitments. We initiate the study of leakage-resilient secret sharing in the
non-compartmentalized model. The leakage adversary can corrupt several players
and obtain their shares, as in normal secret sharing. The leakage adversary can
apply arbitrary affine functions with bounded total output length to the full
share vector and obtain the outputs as leakage. These two processes can be both
non-adaptive and do not depend on each other, or both adaptive and depend on
each other with arbitrary ordering. We construct such leakage-resilient secret
sharing schemes and achieve constant information ratio (the scheme for
non-adaptive adversary is near optimal). We then explore making the
non-compartmentalized leakage-resilient secret sharing also non-malleable
against tampering. We consider a tampering model, where the adversary can use
the shares obtained from the corrupted players and the outputs of the global
leakage functions to choose a tampering function from a tampering family F. We
give two constructions of such leakage-resilient non-malleable secret sharing
for the case F is the bit-wise independent tampering and, respectively, for the
case F is the affine tampering functions.

collusion-resistant fingerprinting scheme [Tardos, STOC 2003], ultimately
resulting in a good understanding of what is the minimum code length required
to achieve collusion-resistance. In contrast, decreasing the cost of the actual
decoding algorithm for identifying the potential colluders has received less
attention, even though previous results have shown that using joint decoding
strategies, deemed too expensive for decoding, may lead to better code lengths.
Moreover, in dynamic settings a fast decoder may be required to provide answers
in real-time, further raising the question whether the decoding costs of
score-based fingerprinting schemes can be decreased with a smarter decoding
algorithm. In this paper we show how to model the decoding step of score-based
fingerprinting as a nearest neighbor search problem, and how this relation
allows us to apply techniques from the field of (approximate) nearest neighbor
searching to obtain decoding times which are sublinear in the total number of
users. As this does not affect the encoding and embedding steps, this decoding
mechanism can easily be deployed within existing fingerprinting schemes, and
this may bring a truly efficient joint decoder closer to reality. Besides the
application to fingerprinting, similar techniques can be used to decrease the
decoding costs of group testing methods, which may be of independent interest.

four typical scenarios of storm tide are examined using the surge-tide-wave

on the GIS platform. The distributions of water elevation show that high water
elevation tends to occur in the bays and around the estuaries. Without
considering the impacts of TCI and SLR, the maximal water elevations caused by
the typhoon wind of 100-year recurrence period can reach as high as 6.06 m,
5.82 m and 5.67 m around Aojiang, Feiyunjiang and Oujiang river estuaries,

deteriorate the situation and enhance the risk of inundation there. The maximal
water elevations at the aforementioned three estuaries considering the

discretized into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, which is numerically
optimized thereafter. Without a near-feasible or near-optimal initial guess,
the NLP-solving process is usually slow. With the purpose of accelerating the
NLP solution, a search-based rough planning stage is added to generate
appropriate initial guesses. Concretely, a continuous state space is
formulated, which consists of Cartesian product of 2D configuration space and a
time dimension. The rough trajectory is generated by a graph-search based

constructed by discretizing the aforementioned continuous spatio-temporal

appears in satellite images and may have implications for TC structure and
intensity. The diurnal pattern can be seen in infrared (IR) satellite imagery
as cyclical pulses in the cloud field that propagate radially outward from the
center of nearly all Atlantic-basin TCs. These diurnal pulses, a distinguishing
characteristic of the TC diurnal cycle, begin forming in the storm's inner core
near sunset each day and appear as a region of cooling cloud-top temperatures.
The area of cooling takes on a ring-like appearance as cloud-top warming occurs
on its inside edge and the cooling moves away from the storm overnight,
reaching several hundred kilometers from the circulation center by the
following afternoon. The state-of-the-art TC diurnal cycle measurement has a
limited ability to analyze the behavior beyond qualitative observations. We
present a method for quantifying the TC diurnal cycle using one-dimensional
persistent homology, a tool from Topological Data Analysis, by tracking maximum
persistence and quantifying the cycle using the discrete Fourier transform.
Using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite IR imagery data from
Hurricane Felix (2007), our method is able to detect an approximate daily

using a combination of hyperpolarization and precision field cycling over a
wide range (1mT-7T), we map frequency dependent relaxation in a prototypical
hybrid system of 13C nuclear spins in diamond coupled to Nitrogen Vacancy
centers. Nuclear hyperpolarization through the optically pumped NV electrons
allows signal time savings for the measurements exceeding million-fold over
conventional methods. We observe that 13C lifetimes show a dramatic field
dependence, growing rapidly with field up to 100mT and saturating thereafter.
Through a systematic study with increasing substitutional electron (P1 center)
concentration as well as 13C enrichment levels, we identify the operational
relaxation channels for the nuclei in different field regimes. In particular,
we demonstrate the dominant role played by the 13C nuclei coupling to the
interacting P1 electronic spin bath. These results pave the way for quantum
control techniques for dissipation engineering to boost spin lifetimes in
diamond, with applications ranging from engineered quantum memories to

has become a high-profile candidate for the modulation scheme in next
generation networks, and many works have been published to analyze it in recent
years. Error performance is one of the most important and interesting aspects
of OFDM-IM, which has been analyzed in most works. However, most of them employ
two key approximations to derive the closed-form expressions of block error
rate (BLER) and/or average bit error rate (BER). The first one is to utilize
the union bound assisted by the pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, and
the second one is to employ an exponential approximation of Q-function. In this
letter, we apply Craig's formula to analyze the error performance for OFDM-IM
in place of the exponential approximation. Because Craig's formula is the exact
expression of Q-function, the accuracy of analytical results regarding error
performance for OFDM-IM can be improved. We examine the proposed error
performance analysis methodology based on Craig's formula by investigating both
average BLER and BER.

the role of the statistical dynamics of vortex filaments in the fascinating
problem of turbulence and the possibility of a breakthrough in constructing an
advanced theory. This aspect arose due to the large amount of evidence, both
experimental and numerical, that the vorticity field in turbulent flows has a
pronounced filamentary structure. In fact, there is unquestionably a strong
relationship between the dynamics of chaotic vortex filaments and turbulent
phenomena. However, the question arises as to whether the basic properties of
turbulence (cascade, scaling laws. etc.) are a consequence of the dynamics of
the vortex filaments (the `dog' concept), or whether the latter have only a
marginal significance (the `tail' concept). Based on well-established results
regarding the dynamics of quantized vortex filaments in superfluids, we
illustrate how these dynamics can lead to the main elements of the theory of
turbulence. We cover key topics such as the exchange of energy between
different scales, the possible origin of Kolmogorov-type spectra and the free
decay behavior.

(LBV) stars, we present 1D hydrodynamical simulations of the response from
sudden energy injection into the interior of a very massive ($100 \, M_\odot$)
star. For a fiducial case with total energy addition set to a factor $f=0.5$ of
the net stellar binding energy, and applied within the stellar envelope, we
detail the dynamical response that leads to ejection of the outermost $7.2 \,
M_\odot$. We find that the ejecta's variations in time $t$ and radius $r$ for
the velocity $v$, density $\rho$, and temperature $T$ are quite well fit by
similarity forms in the variable $r/t \approx v$. Specifically the scaled
density follows a simple exponential decline $\rho t^{3} \sim \exp (-r/v_{\rm
o} t)$. This `exponential similarity' leads to analytic scaling relations for
total ejecta mass $\Delta M$ and kinetic energy $\Delta K$ that agree well with
the hydrodynamical simulations, with the specific-energy-averaged speed related
to the exponential scale speed $v_{\rm o}$ through ${\bar v} \equiv \sqrt{2
\Delta K/\Delta M} = \sqrt{12} \, v_{\rm o}$, and a value comparable to the
star's surface escape speed, $v_{\rm esc}$. Models with energy added in the
core develop a surface shock breakout that propels an initial, higher-speed
ejecta ($>$5000km s$^{-1}$), but the bulk of the ejected material still follows
the same exponential similarity scalings with ${\bar v} \approx v_{\rm esc}$. A
broader parameter study examines how the ejected mass and energy depends on the
energy-addition factor $f$, for three distinct model series that locate the
added energy in either the core, envelope, or near-surface. We conclude by
discussing the relevance of these results for understanding LBV outbursts and
other eruptive phenomena, such as failed supernovae and pulsational pair
instability events.

approaches focus on a depth-free framework to achieve non-Lambertian
performance. However, they trap in the trade-off ""either aliasing or blurring""
problem, i.e., pre-filtering the aliasing components (caused by the angular
sparsity of the input LF) always leads to a blurry result. In this paper, we
intend to solve this challenge by introducing an elaborately designed epipolar
plane image (EPI) structure within a learning-based framework. Specifically, we
start by analytically showing that decreasing the spatial scale of an EPI shows
higher efficiency in addressing the aliasing problem than simply adopting
pre-filtering. Accordingly, we design a Laplacian Pyramid EPI (LapEPI)
structure that contains both low spatial scale EPI (for aliasing) and
high-frequency residuals (for blurring) to solve the trade-off problem. We then
propose a novel network architecture for the LapEPI structure, termed as
LapEPI-net. To ensure the non-Lambertian performance, we adopt a
transfer-learning strategy by first pre-training the network with natural
images then fine-tuning it with unstructured LFs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the high performance and robustness of the proposed approach for
tackling the aliasing-or-blurring problem as well as the non-Lambertian

Our method is able to achieve high classification accuracy and cope with the
challenging scenario of blind detection, i.e., no training sample is available
from ""unknown"" colorization algorithm that we may encounter during the testing
phase. This blind detection performance can be regarded as a generalization
performance. First, we design and implement a base network, which can attain
better performance in terms of classification accuracy and generalization (in
most cases) compared with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we design a
new branch, which analyzes smaller regions of extracted features, and insert it
into the above base network. Consequently, our network can not only improve the
classification accuracy, but also enhance the generalization in the vast
majority of cases. To further improve the performance of blind detection, we
propose to automatically construct negative samples through linear
interpolation of paired natural and colorized images. Then, we progressively
insert these negative samples into the original training dataset and continue
to train the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
achieve stable and high generalization performance when tested against

connecting drivers and passengers through mobile internets. Online matching

in a ride-sourcing system. The average pickup distance or time is an important
measurement of system efficiency since it affects both passengers' waiting time
and drivers' utilization rate. It is naturally expected that a more effective
bipartite matching (with smaller average pickup time) can be implemented if the
platform accumulates more idle drivers and waiting passengers in the matching
pool. A specific passenger request can also benefit from a delayed matching
since he/she may be matched with closer idle drivers after waiting for a few
seconds. Motivated by the potential benefits of delayed matching, this paper
establishes a two-stage framework which incorporates a combinatorial
optimization and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning methods. The
multi-agent reinforcement learning methods are used to dynamically determine
the delayed time for each passenger request (or the time at which each request
enters the matching pool), while the combinatorial optimization conducts an
optimal bipartite matching between idle drivers and waiting passengers in the

statistic given by the number of bigrassmannian permutations below a
permutation in Bruhat order as Reading suggested (2002) and afterward the
author developed (2011). Second, bigrassmannian determinant is a $q$-analog of
the determinant with respect to our statistic. It plays a key role for a
determinantal expression of those polynomials. We further show that
bigrassmannian determinant satisfies weighted condensation as a generalization
of Dodgson, Jacobi-Desnanot and Robbins-Rumsey (1986).

improving the recommendation accuracy and explainability. However, existing
methods largely assume that a KG is complete and simply transfer the
""knowledge"" in KG at the shallow level of entity raw data or embeddings. This
may lead to suboptimal performance, since a practical KG can hardly be
complete, and it is common that a KG has missing facts, relations, and
entities. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider the incomplete nature
of KG when incorporating it into recommender system.
  In this paper, we jointly learn the model of recommendation and knowledge
graph completion. Distinct from previous KG-based recommendation methods, we
transfer the relation information in KG, so as to understand the reasons that a
user likes an item. As an example, if a user has watched several movies
directed by (relation) the same person (entity), we can infer that the director
relation plays a critical role when the user makes the decision, thus help to
understand the user's preference at a finer granularity.
  Technically, we contribute a new translation-based recommendation model,
which specially accounts for various preferences in translating a user to an
item, and then jointly train it with a KG completion model by combining several
transfer schemes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods. Further
analysis verifies the positive effect of joint training on both tasks of
recommendation and KG completion, and the advantage of our model in
understanding user preference. We publish our project at

useful control technique applied to transient chaotic dynamics affected by a

outside a certain region $Q$ of the phase space. For that purpose, there exists
a control bound such that for controls smaller than this bound trajectories are
kept in a special subset of $Q$ called the safe set. The aim of this new
approach is to go further, and to compute for every point of $Q$ the minimal
control bound that would keep it in $Q$. This defines a special function that
we call the safety function, which can provide the necessary information to
compute the safe set once we choose a particular value of the control bound.

learning methods which aims to improve the learning speed of a reinforcement

knowledge from previously learned tasks and transferring that knowledge to use
it in a target task. The latter step is well discussed in the literature with
various methods being proposed for it, while the former has been explored less.
With this in mind, the type of knowledge that is transmitted is very important
and can lead to considerable improvement. Among the literature of both the
transfer learning and the potential-based reward shaping, a subject that has
never been addressed is the knowledge gathered during the learning process
itself. In this paper, we presented a novel potential-based reward shaping

the opportunity of a deeper understanding of the studied system, but also
introduces some new statistical challenges. First, the separation of
information that is common across all or some of the data sets, and the
information that is specific to each data set is problematic. Furthermore,
these data sets are often a mix of quantitative and discrete (binary or
categorical) data types, while commonly used data fusion methods require all
data sets to be quantitative. In this paper, we propose an exponential family
simultaneous component analysis (ESCA) model to tackle the potential mixed data
types problem of multiple data sets. In addition, a structured sparse pattern
of the loading matrix is induced through a nearly unbiased group concave
penalty to disentangle the global, local common and distinct information of the
multiple data sets. A Majorization-Minimization based algorithm is derived to
fit the proposed model. Analytic solutions are derived for updating all the
parameters of the model in each iteration, and the algorithm will decrease the
objective function in each iteration monotonically. For model selection, a
missing value based cross validation procedure is implemented. The advantages
of the proposed method in comparison with other approaches are assessed using
comprehensive simulations as well as the analysis of real data from a chronic

reduce the screening guideline of 10 $\mu$g/dl to 2 $\mu$g/dl. Measurable
cognitive decline (reduced IQ, academic deficits) have been found to occur at
levels below 10mg/dl.
  Knowledge of lead pharmacology allows us to better understand its absorption
and metabolization, mechanisms that produce its medical consequences. Based
upon an original and very simplified compartmental model of Rabinowitz (1973)
with only three major compartments (blood, bone and soft tissue), extensive
biophysical models sprouted over the following two decades. However, none of
these models have been specifically designed to use new knowledge of lead
molecular dynamics to understand its deleterious effects on the brain. We build
and analyze a compartmental model of lead pharmacokinetics, focused

methods, parameter sensitivity analysis and bifurcation theory to study the
transitions in the system's behavior in response to various physiological
parameters.
  We conclude that modeling the complex interaction of lead and calcium along
their dynamic trajectory may successfully explain counter-intuitive effects on
systemic function and neural behavior which could not be addressed by existing
linear models. Our results encourage further efforts towards using nonlinear
phenomenology in conjunction with empirically driven system parameters, to

strong quasi-classical transverse gluon field emerges at about $\tau_0 \simeq
0.1 \, \rm fm/c$ and evolves together with their longitudinal counterparts
according to the classical Yang-Mills (CYM) equations. Recently it has been
shown that these fields induce a diffusion of charm quarks in momentum space
resulting in a tilt of their spectrum without a significant drag. We find that
in nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC such a novel dynamics of charm quarks
leads to an initial enhancement of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$)
at $p_T$ larger than 2 GeV$/c$ contrary to the standard lore. Moreover, the
same dynamics leads to a larger final elliptic flow ($v_2$) inducing a relation
between $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ that is quite close to the experimental
measurements. Our study also shows that such an initial pre-thermal stage is
unlikely to be described in terms of a standard drag and diffusion dynamics,
because even if one tune such coefficients to reproduce the same $R_{AA}(p_T)$
this would imply a significantly smaller $v_2$.

expected attributes, which has received significant attention in recent years.
However, most of the existing methods lack the ability to de-correlate the
target attributes and irrelevant information, i.e., the other attributes and
background information, thus often suffering from blurs and artifacts. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Attribute Manifold Encoding GAN

every detail in the images. Specifically, our method divides the input image
into image attribute part and image background part on manifolds, which are
controlled by attribute latent variables and background latent variables
respectively. Through enforcing attribute latent variables to Gaussian
distributions and background latent variables to uniform distributions
respectively, the attribute transfer procedure becomes controllable and image
generation is more photo-realistic. Furthermore, we adopt a conditional
multi-scale discriminator to render accurate and high-quality target attribute
images. Experimental results on three popular datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method in both performances of the attribute

exploration. Accurate velocity models are key prerequisites for reverse-time
migration and other high-resolution seismic imaging techniques. Such velocity
information has traditionally been derived by tomography or full-waveform
inversion (FWI), which are time consuming and computationally expensive, and
they rely heavily on human interaction and quality control. We investigate a
novel method based on the supervised deep fully convolutional neural network
(FCN) for velocity-model building (VMB) directly from raw seismograms. Unlike
the conventional inversion method based on physical models, the supervised
deep-learning methods are based on big-data training rather than
prior-knowledge assumptions. During the training stage, the network establishes
a nonlinear projection from the multi-shot seismic data to the corresponding
velocity models. During the prediction stage, the trained network can be used
to estimate the velocity models from the new input seismic data. One key
characteristic of the deep-learning method is that it can automatically extract
multi-layer useful features without the need for human-curated activities and
initial velocity setup. The data-driven method usually requires more time
during the training stage, and actual predictions take less time, with only
seconds needed. Therefore, the computational time of geophysical inversions,
including real-time inversions, can be dramatically reduced once a good
generalized network is built. By using numerical experiments on synthetic
models, the promising performances of our proposed method are shown in
comparison with conventional FWI even when the input data are in more realistic
scenarios. Discussions on the deep-learning methods, training dataset, lack of
low frequencies, and advantages and disadvantages of the new method are also

behavior of the system in terms of structural (pairwise connection strength and

limited to synaptic plasticity develops two distinct clusters both structurally

communication across these structural clusters. Hence, dynamic conduction
velocity permits the functional integration of structurally segregated

surface. Since the metallic $\sigma$-bonding bands of honeycomb boron sheet
play a crucial role in the 39 K superconductivity of MgB$_2$, it is physically
interesting to examine whether similar property exists in this material. We
have calculated the electronic structures and the electron-phonon coupling for
honeycomb borophene by explicitly considering the substrate effect using
first-principles density functional theory in conjunction with the Wannier
interpolation technique. We find that the $sp^2$-hybridized $\sigma$-bonding
bands of honeycomb borophene are metallized due to moderate charge transfer
from the Al substrate, similar as in MgB$_2$. However, the electron-phonon
coupling in honeycomb borophene is much weaker than in MgB$_2$ due to the
hardening of the bond-stretching boron phonon modes and the reduction of phonon
density of states. Nevertheless, the interlayer coupling between Al-associated
phonons and electrons in borophene is strong. Based on this observation, we
predict that a 6.5 K superconducting transition can be observed in a
free-standing borophene decorated by a single Al layer, namely monolayer
AlB$_2$. Accordingly, similar superconducting transition temperature could be
expected in honeycomb borophene on Al(111).

to inform predictions for future observations. In the absence of any actual new
data to predict, cross-validation can be used to estimate a model's future
predictive accuracy, for instance, for the purpose of model comparison or
selection. Exact cross-validation for Bayesian models is often computationally
expensive, but approximate cross-validation methods have been developed, most
notably methods for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). If the actual
prediction task is to predict the future given the past, LOO-CV provides an
overly optimistic estimate because the information from future observations is
available to influence predictions of the past. To properly account for the
time series structure, we can use leave-future-out cross-validation (LFO-CV).
Like exact LOO-CV, exact LFO-CV requires refitting the model many times to
different subsets of the data. Using Pareto smoothed importance sampling, we
propose a method for approximating exact LFO-CV that drastically reduces the
computational costs while also providing informative diagnostics about the
quality of the approximation.

deep refactoring of the systems. Therefore, the migration usually has a big
economic impact and companies tend to postpone several activities during this
process, mainly to speed-up the migration itself, but also because of the need
to release new features. Objective. We monitored the Technical Debt of a small
and medium enterprise while migrating a legacy monolithic system to an
ecosystem of microservices to analyze changes in the code technical debt before
and after the migration to microservices. Method. We conducted a case study
analyzing more than four years of the history of a big project (280K Lines of
Code) where two teams extracted five business processes from the monolithic
system as microservices, by first analyzing the Technical Debt with SonarQube
and then performing a qualitative study with the developers to understand the
perceived quality of the system and the motivation for eventually postponed
activities. Result. The development of microservices helps to reduce the
Technical Debt in the long run. Despite an initial spike in the Technical Debt,
due to the development of the new microservice, after a relatively short
period, the Technical Debt tends to grow slower than in the monolithic system.

topology across several DRL benchmark tasks. Additionally, we observe that 1000
learning agents arranged in an Erdos-Renyi graph can perform as well as 3000
agents arranged in the standard fully-connected topology, showing the large
learning improvement possible when carefully designing the topology over which
agents communicate. We complement these empirical results with a theoretical
investigation of why our alternate topologies perform better. Overall, our work
suggests that distributed machine learning algorithms could be made more
effective if the communication topology between learning agents was optimized.

capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers,
they can be operated with extremely low power consumption. However, they have
to use very high-resistance devices, on the order of giga-ohms. We designed a
CMOS VLSI chip to verify weighted-sum operation based on the proposed model
with binary weights, which realizes the BinaryConnect model. In the chip,
memory cells of static-random-access memory (SRAM) are used for synaptic
connection weights. High-resistance operation was realized by using the
subthreshold operation region of MOS transistors unlike the ordinary
computing-in-memory circuits. The chip was designed and fabricated using a
250-nm fabrication technology. Measurement results showed that energy
efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 300~TOPS/W (Tera-Operations Per
Second per Watt), which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that in
state-of-the-art digital AI processors, even though the minimum width of
interconnection used in this chip was several times larger than that in such
digital processors. If state-of-the-art VLSI technology is used to implement
the proposed model, an energy efficiency of more than 1,000~TOPS/W will be
possible. For practical applications, development of emerging analog memory

problem, which is generally framed as the portfolio optimization problem.
General models include the single-period and multi-period cases. The
traditional Mean-Variance model introduced by Harry Markowitz has been the
basis of many models used to solve the portfolio optimization problem. The
overall goal is to achieve the highest return and lowest risk in portfolio
optimization problems. In this paper, we will present an optimal portfolio
based the Markowitz Mean-Variance-Skewness with weight constraints model for
short-term investment opportunities in Iran's stock market. We will use a
neural network based predictor to predict the stock returns and measure the
risk of stocks based on the prediction errors in the neural network. We will
perform a series of experiments on our portfolio optimization model with the
real data from Iran's stock market indices including Bank, Insurance,
Investment, Petroleum Products and Chemicals indices. Finally, 8 different
portfolios with low, medium and high risks for different type of investors
(risk-averse or risk taker) using genetic algorithm will be designed and
analyzed.

Artificial Intelligence (AI). For instance, 100 new professorships are said to
be established. However, the white paper of the government does not answer what
an AI professorship is at all. In order to give colleagues, politicians, and
citizens an idea, we present a view that is often followed when appointing
professors for AI at German and international universities. We hope that it
will help to establish a guideline with internationally accepted measures and
thus make the public debate more informed.
