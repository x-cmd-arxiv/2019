can greatly reduce the repetition rate and adversarial training mitigates
generating incoherent phrases. Our model significantly outperforms the baseline

manipulation capability have a particular need for robotic hand exoskeletons.
Among assistive and rehabilitative medical exoskeletons, there exists a sharp
trade-off between device power on the one hand and ergonomics and portability
on other, devices that provide stronger grasping assistance do so at the cost
of patient comfort. This paper proposes using fin-ray inspired, cable-driven
finger orthoses to generate high fingertip forces without the painful
compressive and shear stresses commonly associated with conventional
cable-drive exoskeletons. With combination cable-driven transmission and
segmented-finger orthoses, the exoskeleton transmitted larger forces and
applied torques discretely to the fingers, leading to strong fingertip forces.
A prototype of the finger orthoses and associated cable transmission was
fabricated, and force transmission tests of the prototype in the finger flexion
mode demonstrated a 2:1 input-output ratio between cable tension and fingertip
force, with a maximum fingertip force of 22 N. Moreover, the proposed design
provides a comfortable experience for wearers thanks to its lightweight and
conformal properties to the hands.

crucial role for coherent detection in almost every communication system.
Particularly in the recently proposed cell-free massive MIMO system, in which a

performance through the use of detection algorithms such as minimum mean square

especially the increase in fronthaul load arising from the transfer of high

paper, we address these CSI acquisition problems by utilizing vector
quantization with precision of only a few bits and we show that the accuracy of
the channel estimate at the CPU can be increased by exploiting the spatial

the Bussgang theorem and compare its performance to

on the surface magnetic field emerging in sunspots, while a suitable proxy of
the evolution of the bright magnetic features, specifically faculae/plage and
network, is missing. This information can potentially be extracted from the
historical full-disc observations in the Ca II K line. We have analysed over
100,000 historical images from 8 digitised photographic archives of the
Arcetri, Kodaikanal, McMath-Hulbert, Meudon, Mitaka, Mt Wilson, Schauinsland,
and Wendelstein observatories, as well as one archive of modern observations
from the Rome/PSPT. The analysed data cover the period 1893--2018. We first
performed careful photometric calibration and compensation for the
centre-to-limb variation, and then segmented the images to identify plage
regions. This has been consistently applied to both historical and modern
observations. The plage series derived from different archives are generally in
good agreement with each other. However, there are also clear deviations that
most likely hint at intrinsic differences in the data and their digitisation.
We showed that accurate image processing significantly reduces errors in the
plage area estimates. Accurate photometric calibration also allows precise
plage identification on images from different archives without the need to
arbitrarily adjust the segmentation parameters. Finally, by comparing the plage
area series from the various records, we found the conversion laws between
them. This allowed us to produce a preliminary composite of the plage areas
obtained from all the datasets studied here. This is a first step towards an
accurate assessment of the long-term variation of plage regions.

astrophysics payload on the International Space Station. It enables
unprecedented high-precision timing of millisecond pulsars without the pulse
broadening and delays due to dispersion and scattering within the interstellar
medium that plague radio timing. We present initial timing results from a year
of data on the millisecond pulsars PSR B1937+21 and PSR J0218+4232, and nine
months of data on PSR B1821-24. NICER time-of-arrival uncertainties for the
three pulsars are consistent with theoretical lower bounds and simulations
based on their pulse shape templates and average source and background photon
count rates. To estimate timing stability, we use the $\sigma_z$ measure, which
is based on the average of the cubic coefficients of polynomial fits to subsets
of timing residuals. So far we are achieving timing stabilities $\sigma_z
\approx 3 \times 10^{-14}$ for PSR B1937+21 and on the order of $10^{-12}$ for
PSRs B1821$-$24 and J0218+4232. Within the span of our \textit{NICER} data we
do not yet see the characteristic break point in the slope of $\sigma_z$;
detection of such a break would indicate that further improvement in the
cumulative root-mean-square (RMS) timing residual is limited by timing noise.
We see this break point in our comparison radio data sets for PSR B1821-24 and
PSR B1937+21 on time scales of $> 2$ years.

  Queue Counterfactuals",,,,,"cs.SI cs.CY econ.EM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Randomized experiments, or A/B tests are used to estimate the causal impact
of a feature on the behavior of users by creating two parallel universes in
which members are simultaneously assigned to treatment and control. However, in
social network settings, members interact, such that the impact of a feature is
not always contained within the treatment group. Researchers have developed a
number of experimental designs to estimate network effects in social settings.
Alternatively, naturally occurring exogenous variation, or 'natural
experiments,' allow researchers to recover causal estimates of peer effects
from observational data in the absence of experimental manipulation. Natural
experiments trade off the engineering costs and some of the ethical concerns
associated with network randomization with the search costs of finding
situations with natural exogenous variation. To mitigate the search costs
associated with discovering natural counterfactuals, we identify a common
engineering requirement used to scale massive online systems, in which natural
exogenous variation is likely to exist: notification queueing. We identify two
natural experiments on the LinkedIn platform based on the order of notification
queues to estimate the causal impact of a received message on the engagement of
a recipient. We show that receiving a message from another member significantly
increases a member's engagement, but that some popular observational
specifications, such as fixed-effects estimators, overestimate this effect by
as much as 2.7x. We then apply the estimated network effect coefficients to a
large body of past experiments to quantify the extent to which it changes our
interpretation of experimental results. The study points to the benefits of
using messaging queues to discover naturally occurring counterfactuals for the
estimation of causal effects without experimenter intervention.

peer-to-peer networks. These protocols are often claimed to guarantee privacy
because of the uncertainty they introduce on the node that started the
dissemination. But is that claim really true? Can the source of a gossip safely
hide in the crowd? This paper examines, for the first time, gossip protocols
through a rigorous mathematical framework based on differential privacy to
determine the extent to which the source of a gossip can be traceable.
Considering the case of a complete graph in which a subset of the nodes are
curious, we study a family of gossip protocols parameterized by a ``muting''
parameter $s$: nodes stop emitting after each communication with a fixed
probability $1-s$. We first prove that the standard push protocol,
corresponding to the case $s=1$, does not satisfy differential privacy for
large graphs. In contrast, the protocol with $s=0$ achieves optimal privacy
guarantees but at the cost of a drastic increase in the spreading time compared
to standard push, revealing an interesting tension between privacy and
spreading time. Yet, surprisingly, we show that some choices of the muting
parameter $s$ lead to protocols that achieve an optimal order of magnitude in
both privacy and speed. We also confirm empirically that, with appropriate
choices of $s$, we indeed obtain protocols that are very robust against
concrete source location attacks while spreading the information almost as fast
as the standard (and non-private) push protocol.

like quantum circuits, ZX-Calculus, ZW-Calculus, etc. Each of these languages
forms a dagger-symmetric monoidal category (dagger-SMC) and comes with an
interpretation functor to the dagger-SMC of (finite dimension) Hilbert spaces.
In the recent years, one of the main achievements of the categorical approach
to quantum mechanics has been to provide several equational theories for most
of these graphical languages, making them complete for various fragments of
pure quantum mechanics. We address the question of the extension of these
languages beyond pure quantum mechanics, in order to reason on mixed states and
general quantum operations, i.e. completely positive maps. Intuitively, such an
extension relies on the axiomatisation of a discard map which allows one to get
rid of a quantum system, operation which is not allowed in pure quantum
mechanics. We introduce a new construction, the discard construction, which
transforms any dagger-symmetric monoidal category into a symmetric monoidal
category equipped with a discard map. Roughly speaking this construction
consists in making any isometry causal. Using this construction we provide an
extension for several graphical languages that we prove to be complete for
general quantum operations. However this construction fails for some fringe
cases like the Clifford+T quantum mechanics, as the category does not have
enough isometries.

measurements in the microwave regime with high-refractive-index mm-disk

achieve quasi-BICs throughout the electromagnetic spectrum inaccessible through

DerSimonian-Laird, restricted maximum likelihood, and Mandel and Paule; the
less-familiar method of Jackson; and the new method (KD) based on the improved
approximation to the distribution of the Q statistic by Kulinskaya and

Q-profile, Biggerstaff and Jackson, Jackson, and KD), six point estimators of
the overall effect (the five inverse-variance estimators related to the point
estimators of $\tau^2$ and an estimator (SSW) whose weights use only
study-level sample sizes), and eight interval estimators for the overall effect
(five based on the point estimators for $\tau^2$; the
Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) interval; a KD-based modification of HKSJ;
and an interval based on the sample-size-weighted estimator). Results of our
simulations show that none of the point estimators of $\tau^2$ can be
recommended, however the new KD estimator provides a reliable coverage of
$\tau^2$. Inverse-variance estimators of the overall effect are substantially
biased. The SSW estimator of the overall effect and the related confidence
interval provide the reliable point and interval estimation of log-odds-ratio.

due to the fluid stresses. Recent experimental and theoretical studies on the
steady flow in shallow deformable microchannels have shown that the flow rate
is a nonlinear function of the pressure drop due to the deformation of the
upper soft wall. Here, we extend the steady theory of Christov et al. (2018) by
considering the start-up flow from rest, both in pressure-controlled and in
flow-rate-controlled configurations. The characteristic scales and relevant
parameters governing the transient flow are first identified, followed by the
development of an unsteady lubrication theory assuming that the inertia of the
fluid is negligible, and that the upper wall can be modeled as an elastic plate
under pure bending satisfying the Kirchhoff-Love equation. The model is
governed by two non-geometrical dimensionless numbers: a compliance parameter
$\beta$, which compares the characteristic displacement of the upper wall with
the undeformed channel height, and a parameter $\gamma$ that compares the
inertia of the solid with its flexural rigidity. In the limit of negligible
solid inertia, $\gamma \to 0$, a quasi-steady model is developed, whereby the
fluid pressure satisfies a nonlinear diffusion equation, with $\beta$ as the
only parameter, which admits a self-similar solution under pressure-controlled
conditions. This simplified lubrication description is validated with coupled
three-dimensional numerical simulations of the Navier equations for the elastic
solid and the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid. The agreement is very good
when the hypotheses behind the model are satisfied. Unexpectedly, we find fair
agreement even in cases where the solid and liquid inertia cannot be neglected.

wettability and inclination on the post impact dynamics of droplets. Maximum
spreading diameter and spreading time were found to decrease with increasing
inclination angle and normal Weber number for superhydrophobic surfaces. The
experiments on SH surfaces were found to be in excellent agreement with an
existing analytical model, incorporated with the modifications for the oblique
impact conditions. Energy ratios and elongation factor were also measured for
different inclination angles. On inclined SH surfaces, different features like
arrest of secondary droplet formation, reduced pinch off at the contact line
and inclination dependent elongation mechanism were observed. Contrary to SH
surfaces, hydrophilic surfaces show opposite trends of maximum spreading factor
and spreading time with inclination angle and normal Weber number respectively.
This was due to the dominance of tangential kinetic energy over adhesion energy
and gravitational potential at higher inclination angles. Finally, colloidal
solutions of nanoparticles were used to elucidate slip and disjoining pressure
on SH and hydrophilic surfaces, respectively. Overall, the article provides a
comprehensive picture of post impact dynamics of droplets on inclined surfaces
encompassing a broad spectrum of governing parameters like Reynolds number,
Weber number, degree of inclination and surface wettability.

by training a spelling correction (SC) model to explicitly correct those

piecewise-linear recurrent neural networks (PLRNN) to assess dynamics from
neuroimaging data. In contrast to many other nonlinear time series models which
have been proposed for reconstructing latent dynamics, our model is easily
interpretable in neural terms, amenable to systematic dynamical systems
analysis of the resulting set of equations, and can straightforwardly be
transformed into an equivalent continuous-time dynamical system. The major
contributions of this paper are the introduction of a new observation model
suitable for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coupled to the latent
PLRNN, an efficient stepwise training procedure that forces the latent model to
capture the 'true' underlying dynamics rather than just fitting (or predicting)
the observations, and of an empirical measure based on the Kullback-Leibler
divergence to evaluate from empirical time series how well this goal of
approximating the underlying dynamics has been achieved. We validate and
illustrate the power of our approach on simulated 'ground-truth' dynamical

demonstrate that the latent dynamics harbors task-related nonlinear structure
that a linear dynamical model fails to capture. Given that fMRI is one of the
most common techniques for measuring brain activity non-invasively in human
subjects, this approach may provide a novel step toward analyzing aberrant

by dense, high-velocity clouds from the broad-line region, which may penetrate
into the jet and lead to the formation of a strong shock. Such jet-cloud
interactions are expected to have measurable effects on the $\gamma$-ray
emission from blazars. We characterise the dynamics of a typical cloud-jet
interaction scenario, and the evolution of its radiative output in the
0.1-30~GeV energy range, to assess to what extent these interactions can
contribute to the $\gamma$-ray emission in blazars. We use semi-analytical
descriptions of the jet-cloud dynamics, taking into account the expansion of
the cloud inside the jet and its acceleration. Assuming that electrons are
accelerated in the interaction and making use of the hydrodynamical
information, we then compute the high-energy radiation from the cloud,
including the absorption of $\gamma$-rays in the ambient photon field through
pair creation. Jet-cloud interactions can lead to significant $\gamma$-ray
fluxes in blazars with a broad-line region, in particular when the cloud
expansion and acceleration inside the jet are taken into account. This is
caused by 1) the increased shocked area in the jet, which leads to an increase
in the energy budget for the non-thermal emission; 2) a more efficient inverse
Compton cooling with the boosted photon field of the broad-line region; and 3)
an increased observer luminosity due to Doppler boosting effects. For typical
broad-line region parameters, either (i) jet-cloud interactions contribute
significantly to the persistent $\gamma$-ray emission from blazars or (ii) the
broad-line region is far from spherical or the fraction of energy deposited in
non-thermal electrons is small.

constant electric field and a thermal background. We show that this process is
similar to dynamically assisted Schwinger pair production, where the strong
field is instead assisted by another coherent field, which is weaker but
faster. We treat the interaction with the photons from the thermal background
perturbatively, while the interaction with the electric field is
nonperturbative (i.e. a Furry picture expansion in $\alpha$). At
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$ we have ordinary perturbative Breit-Wheeler pair
production assisted nonperturbatively by the electric field. Already at this
order we recover the same exponential part of the probability as previous
studies, which did not expand in $\alpha$. This means that we do not have to
consider higher orders, so our approach allows us to calculate the
pre-exponential part of the probability, which has not been obtained before in
this regime. Although the prefactor is in general subdominant compared to the
exponential part, in this case it can be important because it scales as
$\alpha^2\ll1$ and is therefore much smaller than the prefactor at
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha^0)$ (pure Schwinger pair production). We show that, because
of the exponential enhancement, $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$ still gives the
dominant contribution for temperatures above a certain threshold, but, because
of the small prefactor, the threshold is higher than what the exponential alone
would suggest.

that the optimal potential function is convex and the optimal transport map is
the gradient of the optimal potential function. Using this geometric structure,
we restrict the optimization problem to different parametrized classes of
convex functions and pay special attention to the class of input-convex neural

power of the resulting approximate metric, and we prove a restricted
moment-matching property for the approximate optimal map. Finally, we discuss a
numerical algorithm to solve the restricted optimization problem and provide
numerical experiments to illustrate and compare the proposed approach with the
established regularization-based approaches. We further discuss practical

work, we study the interacting Aubry-Andre model, a prototype quasiperiodic
system, as a function of incommensurate potential strength using a novel
dynamical measure, information scrambling, in a large system of 200 lattice
sites. Between the thermal phase and the many-body localized phase, we find an
intermediate dynamical phase where the butterfly velocity is zero and
information spreads in space as a power-law in time. This is in contrast to the
ballistic spreading in the thermal phase and logarithmic spreading in the
localized phase. We further investigate the entanglement structure of the
many-body eigenstates in the intermediate phase and find strong fluctuations in
eigenstate entanglement entropy within a given energy window, which is
inconsistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Machine-learning on
the entanglement spectrum also reaches the same conclusion. Our large-scale
simulations suggest that the intermediate phase with vanishing butterfly

infrared modified theories have been shown to be equivalent to standard Maxwell
electrodynamics with an additional classical electromagnetic current induced by
the quantum charges. The induced current only has support for very small

this work we explore the possibility that this de-electrification effect could

stringent limits on the electric charge asymmetry of the universe. We consider
a simple model of infrared-modified scalar electrodynamics in the cosmological

energy-momentum tensor whose dominant contribution at late times is a
cosmological constant-like term. If the charge asymmetry was generated during
inflation, the limits on the asymmetry parameter in order not to produce a
too-large cosmological constant are very stringent $\eta_Q <10^{-131}-
10^{-144}$ for a number of e-folds $N=50-60$ in typical models. However if the
charge imbalance is produced after inflation, the limits are relaxed in such a
way that $\eta_Q<10^{-43}(100 \,\mbox{GeV}/T_Q)$, with $T_Q$ the temperature at

are unstable to the formation of a strong bar of semi-major axis 2 < a_B < 3

become inconsistent with the current, apparently well-settled, state. The
formation of a bar is unaffected by how the gas component is modelled, by
increasing the mass of the nuclear star cluster, or by making the dark matter
halo counter-rotate, but it can be prevented by either reducing the
mass-to-light ratio of the stars to Upsilon_V ~ 0.6 or Upsilon_K ~ 0.23 in
solar units or by increasing the random motions of the stars. Also a shorter
and weaker bar results when the halo is rigid and unresponsive. However, all
three near-stable models support multi-arm spirals, and not the observed
large-scale bi-symmetric spiral. A two-arm spiral pattern could perhaps be
tidally induced, but such a model would require an implausibly low mass disc to
avoid a bar and there is no visible culprit. Thus the survival of the current

forming melts, yet it is usually determined from the average co-ordination
number through the chemical composition. A discussion is presented on how
viscoelasticity can be used as an alternative way to determine glass rigidity
and to give clues about the relaxation processes. In particular, it is shown
that the transverse current dynamical structure factor of dense glass and
crystal forming fluids contain rich information about rigidity that can be
related with the presence of a dynamical-gap for transversal vibrational modes.
As a result, the number of floppy modes can be related with the size of the
dynamical gap and with the liquid relaxation time. From this, a dynamical
average effective coordination number can be defined. As an example, numerical
simulations for hard-disks in a dense fluid phase are provided. Finally, a
discussion is presented on the need to improve glass viscoelasticity models to
describe consistently non-exponential stress and strain relaxation.

influence of electric fields on the evaporation kinetics of pendant droplets.
It is shown that the evaporation kinetics of saline pendant droplets can be
augmented by the application of an external alternating electric field. The
evaporation behaviour is modulated by an increase in the field strength and
frequency. The classical diffusion driven evaporation model is found
insufficient in predicting the improved evaporation rates. The change in
surface tension due to field constraint is insufficient for explaining the
observed physics. Consequently, the internal hydrodynamics of the droplet is
probed employing particle image velocimetry. It is revealed that the electric
field induces enhanced internal advection, which improves the evaporation
rates. A scaled analytical model is proposed to understand the role of internal
electrohydrodynamics, electrothermal and the electrosolutal effects. Stability
maps reveal that the advection is caused nearly equally by the electrosolutal
and electrothermal effects within the droplet. The model is able to illustrate
the influence played by the governing thermal and solutal Marangoni number, the
electro Prandtl and electro Schmidt number, and the associated
Electrohydrodynamic number. The magnitude of the internal circulation can be
well predicted by the proposed model, which validates the proposed mechanism.

node information and topological structure, have been demonstrated to be
powerful in learning on graph data. These advantages of GNNs provide great
potential to advance social recommendation since data in social recommender
systems can be represented as user-user social graph and user-item graph; and
learning latent factors of users and items is the key. However, building social
recommender systems based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user-item
graph encodes both interactions and their associated opinions; social relations
have heterogeneous strengths; users involve in two graphs (e.g., the user-user
social graph and the user-item graph). To address the three aforementioned
challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we present a novel graph neural
network framework (GraphRec) for social recommendations. In particular, we
provide a principled approach to jointly capture interactions and opinions in
the user-item graph and propose the framework GraphRec, which coherently models
two graphs and heterogeneous strengths. Extensive experiments on two real-world

  Process in Small Organizations","30 pages",,,,"cs.SE cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing usable products is important to provide a competitive edge through
user satisfaction. A first step to establish or improve a usability process is
to perform a process assessment. As this may be costly, an alternative for
organizations seeking for lighter assessments, especially small organizations,
may be self-assessments. They can be carried out by an organization on its own
to assess the capability of its process. Although there are specific assessment
methods to assess the usability process, none of them provides a
self-assessment method considering the specific characteristics of small
organizations. The objective of this research is to propose a method for
self-assessing the capability of the usability process in small organizations.
The method consists of a usability process reference model, a measurement
framework, an assessment model, and a self-assessment process supported by an
online tool. Based on systematic mapping studies on usability
capability/maturity models and software process self-assessment methods, we
identified the specific requirements of such a method. The UPCASE method was
systematically developed using a multi-method approach based on the ISO/IEC TR
29110 and ISO/TR 18529 standard. The method has been applied and evaluated with
respect to its reliability, usability, comprehensibility and internal
consistency through a series of case studies. First results indicate that the
method may be reliable. Feedback also indicates that the method is easy to use
and understandable even for non-software process improvement experts. The
UPCASE method is a first step to the self-assessment of the usability process
in small organizations supporting the systematic establishment and improvement
of the usability process contributing to the improvement of the usability of
their software products.

diverse as population genetics, opinion formation, species competition and
language dynamics, among others. In a single step of the dynamics, an
individual chosen at random copies the state of a random neighbor in the
population. In this basic formulation it is assumed that the copying is
perfect, and thus an exact copy of an individual is generated at each time
step. Here we introduce and study a variant of the multi-state voter model in
mean-field that incorporates a degree of imperfection or error in the copying
process, which leaves the states of the two interacting individuals similar but
not exactly equal. This dynamics can also be interpreted as a perfect copying
with the addition of noise; a minimalistic model for flocking. We found that
the ordering properties of this multi-state noisy voter model, measured by a
parameter $\psi$ in [0, 1], depend on the amplitude $\eta$ of the copying error
or noise and the population size N. In the case of perfect copying $\eta=0$ the
system reaches an absorbing configuration with complete order ($\psi=1$) for
all values of N. However, for any degree of imperfection $\eta>0$, we show that
the average value of $\psi$ at the stationary state decreases with N as
$\langle \psi \rangle \simeq 6/(\pi^2 \eta^2 N)$ for $\eta \ll 1$ and $\eta^2 N
\gtrsim 1$, and thus the system becomes totally disordered in the thermodynamic
limit $N \to \infty$. We also show that $\langle \psi \rangle \simeq 1-1.64 \,

complete order is never achieved for $\eta > 0$. These results are supported by
Monte Carlo simulations of the model, which allow to study other scenarios as

solution of the nonlinear filtering problem in continuous-time settings. In any
numerical implementation of the FPF algorithm, the main challenge is to
numerically approximate the so-called gain function. A numerical algorithm for
gain function approximation is the subject of this paper. The exact gain
function is the solution of a Poisson equation involving a probability-weighted
Laplacian $\Delta_\rho$. The numerical problem is to approximate this solution
using {\em only} finitely many particles sampled from the probability
distribution $\rho$. A diffusion map-based algorithm was proposed by the
authors in a prior work to solve this problem. The algorithm is named as such
because it involves, as an intermediate step, a diffusion map approximation of
the exact semigroup $e^{\Delta_\rho}$. The original contribution of this paper
is to carry out a rigorous error analysis of the diffusion map-based algorithm.
The error is shown to include two components: bias and variance. The bias
results from the diffusion map approximation of the exact semigroup. The
variance arises because of finite sample size. Scalings and upper bounds are
derived for bias and variance. These bounds are then illustrated with numerical
experiments that serve to emphasize the effects of problem dimension and sample
size. The proposed algorithm is applied to two filtering examples and
comparisons provided with the sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle

efficient and sustainable ridesharing service: ridesharing market design. We
formulate it as a fair cost allocation problem through the lens of the
cooperative game theory. A special property of the cooperative ridesharing game
is that its characteristic function values are calculated by solving an
optimization problem. Several concepts of fairness are investigated and special
attention is paid to a solution concept named nucleolus, which aims to minimize
the maximum dissatisfaction in the system. Due to its computational
intractability, we break the problem into a master-subproblem structure and two
subproblems are developed to generate constraints for the master problem. We
propose a coalition generation procedure to find the nucleolus and approximate
nucleolus of the game. Experimental results showed that when the game has a
non-empty core, in the approximate nucleolus scheme the coalitions are computed
only when it is necessary and the approximate procedure produces the actual
nucleolus. And when the game has an empty core, the approximate nucleolus is
close to the actual one. Regardless of the emptiness of the game, our algorithm
needs to generate only a small fraction (1.6%) of the total coalition
constraints to compute the approximate nucleolus. The proposed model and
results nicely fit systems operated by autonomous vehicles.

reaches S1 and methodological differences in the assessment of cortical
representations that might explain these findings. We used functional magnetic
resonance imaging during a virtual hand motor task, analogous to the classical
mirror box task, in amputees with and without PLP and in matched controls. We
assessed the relationship between task-related activation maxima and PLP
intensity in S1 versus motor (M1) maps. We also measured cortical distances
between the location of activation maxima using region of interest (ROI),
defined from individual or group analyses. Amputees showed significantly
increased activity in M1 and S1 compared to controls, which was not
significantly related to PLP intensity. The location of activation maxima
differed between groups depending on M1 and S1 maps. Neural activity was
positively related to PLP only in amputees with pain and only if a
group-defined ROI was chosen. These findings show that the analysis of changes
in S1 versus M1 yields different results, possibly indicating different
pain-related processes.

the relation between memories and the network's hidden state dynamics was
established over the last decade, previous works in this direction were of a
predominantly descriptive nature focusing mainly on locating the dynamical
objects of interest. In particular, it remained unclear how dynamical
observables affect the performance, how they form and whether they can be
manipulated. Here, we utilize different training protocols, datasets and
architectures to obtain a range of networks solving a delayed classification
task with similar performance, alongside substantial differences in their
ability to extrapolate for longer delays. We analyze the dynamics of the
network's hidden state, and uncover the reasons for this difference. Each
memory is found to be associated with a nearly steady state of the dynamics
which we refer to as a 'slow point'. Slow point speeds predict extrapolation
performance across all datasets, protocols and architectures tested.
Furthermore, by tracking the formation of the slow points we are able to
understand the origin of differences between training protocols. Finally, we
propose a novel regularization technique that is based on the relation between
hidden state speeds and memory longevity. Our technique manipulates these
speeds, thereby leading to a dramatic improvement in memory robustness over
time, and could pave the way for a new class of regularization methods.

conservation dictates that the absorbed photons transfer their momentum
$p_{\gamma}=E_{\gamma}/c$ to the electron and its parent ion. Even after 30
years of studying strong-field ionization, the sharing of the photon momentum
between the two particles and its underlying mechanism are still under debate
in theory. Corresponding experiments are very challenging due to the extremely
small photon momentum ($~10^{-4}$ a.u.) and their precision has been too
limited, so far, to ultimately resolve the debate. Here, by utilizing a novel
experimental approach of two counter-propagating laser pulses, we present a
detailed study on the effects of the photon momentum in strong-field
ionization. The high precision and self-referencing of the method allows to
unambiguously demonstrate the action of the light's magnetic field on the
electron while it is under the tunnel barrier, confirming theoretical
predictions, disproving others. Our results deepen the understanding of, for
example, molecular imaging and time-resolved photoelectron holography.

on energy distance and maximum mean discrepancy are mainly targeting the
differences between marginal means and variances, whereas the test based on

sheds new light on the limitation of inter-point distance based tests, the

measurement anomalies in real-time to eliminate their effects on the state

subcortical brain structures, which would be useful in neuroimaging studies of
many neurological disorders. However, most of the previous deep learning work
does not investigate the specific difficulties that exist in segmenting
extremely small but important brain regions such as the amygdala and its
subregions. To tackle this challenging task, a novel 3D Bayesian fully
convolutional neural network was developed to apply a dilated dualpathway
approach that retains fine details and utilizes both local and more global
contextual information to automatically segment the amygdala and its subregions
at high precision. The proposed method provides insights on network design and
sampling strategy that target segmentations of small 3D structures. In
particular, this study confirms that a large context, enabled by a large field
of view, is beneficial for segmenting small objects; furthermore, precise
contextual information enabled by dilated convolutions allows for better
boundary localization, which is critical for examining the morphology of the
structure. In addition, it is demonstrated that the uncertainty information
estimated from our network may be leveraged to identify atypicality in data.
Our method was compared with two state-of-the-art deep learning models and a
traditional multi-atlas approach, and exhibited excellent performance as
measured both by Dice overlap as well as average symmetric surface distance. To
the best of our knowledge, this work is the first deep learning-based approach
that targets the subregions of the amygdala.

gradient errors are strongly reduced by using an integral approach. We consider
both adiabatic and radiative simulations. We construct clusters subsamples
according to the cluster dynamical status or gas physical modeling, from which
we extract small-scale turbulent velocities obtained by applying to cluster
velocities different multiscale filtering methods. The velocity power spectra
of non-radiative relaxed clusters are mostly solenoidal and steeper than
Kolgomorov. Cooling runs are distinguished by much shallower spectra, a feature
which we interpret as the injection of turbulence at small scales due to the
interaction of compact cool gas cores with the ICM. Turbulence in galaxy
clusters is then characterized by multiple injection scales, with the small
scale driving source acting in addition to the large scale injection
mechanisms. Cooling runs of relaxed clusters exhibit enstrophy profiles with a
power-law behavior over more than two decades in radius, and a
turbulent-to-thermal energy ratio ~1 %. In accord with Hitomi observations, in
the core of a highly relaxed cluster we find low level of gas motions. In
addition, the estimated cluster radial profile of the sloshing oscillation
period exhibits an associated Froude number satisfying Fr ~ 0.1 within r /
r_{200} <~ 0.1. Our findings suggest that in cluster cores ICM turbulence
approaches a stratified anisotropic regime, with weak stirring motions
dominated by gravity buoyancy forces and strongly suppressed along the radial

Its location coincides with the southern latitudes of the NEB (7--17$^{\circ}$

latitudes $\lesssim |20^\circ|$. The lowest brightness temperature is in the EZ
near a latitude of 4$^\circ$N, and the NEB has the highest brightness
temperature near 11$^\circ$N. The bright part of the NEB increases in
latitudinal extent (spreads towards the north) with deceasing frequency, i.e.,
with depth into the atmosphere. In longitude-resolved maps, several belts, in
particular in the southern hemisphere, are not continuous along the latitude
line, but broken into small segments as if caused by an underlying wave. (iii)
Model fits to longitude-smeared spectra are obtained at each latitude. These
show a high NH$_3$ abundance (volume mixing ratio $\sim 4 \times 10^{-4}$) in
the deep ($P>8-10$ bar) atmosphere, decreasing at higher altitudes due to cloud
formation (e.g., in zones), or dynamics in combination with cloud condensation

propose to oversample those images with small objects and augment each of those

evaluate different pasting augmentation strategies, and ultimately, we achieve

When mutational robustness is high, most mutations do not change fitness or
have only a minor effect on it. From the point of view of fitness landscapes,
robust genotypes form neutral networks of almost equal fitness. Using
deterministic population models it has been shown that selection favors
genotypes inside such networks, which results in increased mutational
robustness. Here we demonstrate that this effect is massively enhanced by
recombination. Our results are based on a detailed analysis of mesa-shaped
fitness landscapes, where we derive precise expressions for the dependence of
the robustness on the landscape parameters for recombining and non-recombining
populations. In addition, we carry out numerical simulations on different types
of random holey landscapes as well as on an empirical fitness landscape. We
show that the mutational robustness of a genotype generally correlates with its
recombination weight, a new measure that quantifies the likelihood for the
genotype to arise from recombination. We argue that the favorable effect of
recombination on mutational robustness is a highly universal feature that may
have played an important role in the emergence and maintenance of mechanisms of
genetic exchange.

personalization of the synergy setting is necessary for the effective operation

synergies in human-prosthesis interfaces. The first is related to the process
of human motor adaptation and the second to the variation in motor learning
dynamics of individuals. In this paper, a systematic personalization of
kinematic synergies for human-prosthesis interfaces using on-line measurements
from each individual is proposed. The task of reaching using the upper-limb is
described by an objective function and the interface is parameterized by a
kinematic synergy. Consequently, personalizing the interface for a given
individual can be formulated as finding an optimal personalized parameter. A
structure to model the observed motor behavior that allows for the personalized
traits of motor preference and motor learning is proposed, and subsequently
used in an on-line optimization scheme to identify the synergies for an
individual. The knowledge of the common features contained in the model enables
on-line adaptation of the human-prosthesis interface to happen concurrently to
human motor adaptation without the need to re-tune the personalization
algorithm for each individual. Human-in-the-loop experimental results with
able-bodied subjects, performed in a virtual reality environment to emulate
amputation and prosthesis use, show that the proposed personalization algorithm
was effective in obtaining optimal synergies with a fast uniform convergence

  Our proof proceeds in two steps. First, we give a reduction from the

showing that no low-degree polynomial can (in expectation) distinguish the
spiked and unspiked models. This method for identifying computational
thresholds was proposed in a sequence of recent works on the sum-of-squares

proof can be seen as constructing a distribution over symmetric matrices that
appears computationally indistinguishable from the GOE, yet is supported on
matrices whose maximum quadratic form over $\boldsymbol x \in \mathcal{S}$ is
much larger than that of a GOE matrix.

Reynolds numbers, we show that circulation exhibits a bifractal behavior at the
highest Reynolds number considered: space filling for moments up to order $3$

orders; this change in character roughly at the third-order moment is
reminiscent of a ""phase transition"". We explore the possibility that
circulation becomes effectively space filling at much higher Reynolds numbers

for a figure-$8$ loop, the relevant area is the scalar sum of the two segments

is based on the piece-wise smooth approximation of the matrices involved in a
standard finite element discretization. In particular, it relies on the
projection of smooth so-called stencil functions onto high-order polynomial
subspaces. The performance advantage of the surrogate matrix methodology is
seen in constructions where each stencil function uniquely determines the

shown to be widely achievable through the use of locally-structured meshes.
Therefore, this methodology can be applied to a wide variety of physically
meaningful problems, including nonlinear problems and problems with curvilinear

novel surrogate method for the variable coefficient Poisson equation. The
flexibility of the methodology is also demonstrated through the construction of
novel methods for linear elasticity and nonlinear diffusion problems. In

Roughly speaking, a matrix is rigid if its rank cannot be reduced significantly
by changing a small number of entries. There has been extensive interest in
rigid matrices as Valiant showed in his MFCS'77 paper that rigidity can be used
to prove arithmetic circuit lower bounds.
  In a surprising result, Alman and Williams (FOCS'19) showed that the (real
valued) Hadamard matrix, which was conjectured to be rigid, is actually not
very rigid. This line of work was extended by Dvir and Edelman (\emph{Theory of
Computing}, 2019) to a family of matrices related to the Hadamard matrix, but
over finite fields. In our work, we take another step in this direction and
show that for any abelian group $G$ and function $f:G \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$,
the matrix given by $M_{xy} = f(x - y)$ for $x,y \in G$ is not rigid. In
particular, we get that complex valued Fourier matrices, circulant matrices,
and Toeplitz matrices are all not rigid and cannot be used to carry out
Valiant's approach to proving circuit lower bounds. Our results also hold when
we consider matrices over a fixed finite field instead of the complex numbers.
This complements a recent result of Goldreich and Tal (\emph{Comp. Complexity},
2018) who showed that Toeplitz matrices are nontrivially rigid (but not enough
for Valiant's method). Our work differs from previous non-rigidity results in
that those works considered matrices whose underlying group of symmetries was
of the form $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ with $p$ fixed and $n$ tending to infinity, while
in the families of matrices we study, the underlying group of symmetries can be
any abelian group and, in particular, the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_N$, which
has very different structure. Our results also suggest natural new candidates
for rigidity in the form of matrices whose symmetry groups are highly
non-abelian.

perturbations at Paranal Observatory and the Chilean coast tides, which are
mostly modulated by the 14-day syzygy solar-lunar tidal cycle. To this aim, we
downloaded 15 years (2003-2017) of cloud coverage data from the AQUA satellite,
in a matrix that includes also Armazones, the site of the European Extremely
Large Telescope. By applying the Fast Fourier Transform to these data we
detected a periodicity peak of about 14 days. We studied the tide cycle at
Chanaral De Las Animas, on the ocean coast, for the year 2017, and we
correlated it with the atmospheric perturbations at Paranal and the lunar
phases. We found a significant correlation (96%) between the phenomena of short
duration and intensity (1-3 days) and the tidal cycle at Chanaral. We then show
that an atmospheric perturbation occurs at Paranal in concomitance with the low
tide, which anticipates the full (or the new) moon by 3-4 days. This result
allows to improve current weather forecasting models for astronomical
observatories by introducing a lunar variable.

science and technology. For practical applications, large-scale
room-temperature solid-state platforms are required. Color centers in layered
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently been found to be ultra-bright and
stable SPEs at room temperature. Yet, to scale up solid-state quantum
information processing, large tuning range of single photon energy is demanded
for wavelength division multiplexing quantum key distribution, where
indistinguishability is not required, and for indistinguishable single-photon
production from multi-emitters. Stark effect can tune the single photon energy
by an electric field, which however, has been achieved only at cryogenic
temperature so far. Here we report the first room-temperature Stark effect of
SPEs by exploiting hBN color centers. Surprisingly, we observe a giant Stark
shift of single photon more than 30 meV, about one order of magnitude greater
than previously reported in color center emitters. Moreover, for the first
time, the orientation of the electric permanent dipole moment in the
solid-state SPE is determined via angle-resolved Stark effect, revealing the
intrinsic broken symmetries at such a color center. The remarkable Stark shift
discovered here and the significant advance in understanding its atomic

inference-as-a-service for clients. In this scenario, clients send their raw
data to the server to run the deep learning model and send back the results.
One standing challenge in this setting is to ensure the privacy of the clients'
sensitive data. Oblivious inference is the task of running the neural network
on the client's input without disclosing the input or the result to the server.
This paper introduces XONN, a novel end-to-end framework based on Yao's Garbled
Circuits (GC) protocol, that provides a paradigm shift in the conceptual and
practical realization of oblivious inference. In XONN, the costly
matrix-multiplication operations of the deep learning model are replaced with
XNOR operations that are essentially free in GC. We further provide a novel
algorithm that customizes the neural network such that the runtime of the GC
protocol is minimized without sacrificing the inference accuracy.
  We design a user-friendly high-level API for XONN, allowing expression of the
deep learning model architecture in an unprecedented level of abstraction.
Extensive proof-of-concept evaluation on various neural network architectures
demonstrates that XONN outperforms prior art such as Gazelle (USENIX
Security'18) by up to 7x, MiniONN (ACM CCS'17) by 93x, and SecureML (IEEE
S&P'17) by 37x. State-of-the-art frameworks require one round of interaction
between the client and the server for each layer of the neural network,
whereas, XONN requires a constant round of interactions for any number of
layers in the model. XONN is first to perform oblivious inference on Fitnet
architectures with up to 21 layers, suggesting a new level of scalability
compared with state-of-the-art. Moreover, we evaluate XONN on four datasets to
perform privacy-preserving medical diagnosis.

  Generation Primitives",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  DRAM manufacturers have been prioritizing memory capacity, yield, and
bandwidth for years, while trying to keep the design complexity as simple as
possible. DRAM chips do not carry out any computation or other important
functions, such as security. Processors implement most of the existing security
mechanisms that protect the system against security threats, because 1)
executing security mechanisms usually require non-trivial computational
capabilities (e.g., encryption), and 2) commodity DRAM chips are not designed
to perform computations or tasks other than data storage. In this work, we
advocate for DRAM as a key component for providing security mechanisms to the
system. To this end, we propose Dataplant, a new class of low-cost,
high-performance, and reliable security primitives that can be integrated in
commodity DRAM chips with minimal changes. The main idea of Dataplant is to
slightly modify the internal DRAM timing signals to expose the inherent process
variation found in all DRAM chips for generating unpredictable but reproducible
values (e.g., keys) within DRAM. We use Dataplant to build two new security
mechanisms. First, a new Dataplant-based physical unclonable function (PUF)
with non-destructive read-out, low evaluation latency, robust responses,
resiliency to temperature changes, and data-independent responses. Second, a
new cold boot attack prevention mechanism that automatically destroys all data
within DRAM on every power cycle with zero run-time energy and latency
overheads. Using a combination of detailed simulations and experiments with 136
real commodity DRAM chips, we show that our Dataplant-based PUF has 1.8x higher
throughput than the best state-of-the-art DRAM PUFs. We also demonstrate that
our Dataplant-based cold boot attack protection mechanism is 19.5x faster and
consumes 2.54x less energy when compared to existing mechanisms.

computing called distributed serving with mobile servers (DSMS). In DSMS, there
are $k$ identical mobile servers residing at the processors of a network. At
arbitrary points of time, any subset of processors can invoke one or more
requests. To serve a request, one of the servers must move to the processor
that invoked the request. Resource allocation is performed in a distributed
manner since only the processor that invoked the request initially knows about
it. All processors cooperate by passing messages to achieve correct resource
allocation. They do this with the goal to minimize the communication cost.
  Routing servers in large-scale distributed systems requires a scalable
location service. We introduce the distributed protocol GNN that solves the
DSMS problem on overlay trees. We prove that GNN is starvation-free and
correctly integrates locating the servers and synchronizing the concurrent
access to servers despite asynchrony, even when the requests are invoked over
time. Further, we analyze GNN for ""one-shot"" executions, i.e., all requests are
invoked simultaneously. We prove that when running GNN on top of a special
family of tree topologies---known as hierarchically well-separated trees
(HSTs)---we obtain a randomized distributed protocol with an expected
competitive ratio of $O(\log n)$ on general network topologies with $n$
processors. From a technical point of view, our main result is that GNN
optimally solves the DSMS problem on HSTs for one-shot executions, even if
communication is asynchronous. Further, we present a lower bound of
$\Omega(\max\{k, \log n/\log\log n\})$ on the competitive ratio for DSMS. The
lower bound even holds when communication is synchronous and requests are

consuming fewer resources provides any selective advantage. To answer this
question, we propose a Wright- Fisher model with two types of individuals: the
inefficient individuals, those who need more resources to reproduce and can
have a higher growth rate, and the efficient individuals. In this model, the
total amount of resource N, is fixed, and the population size varies randomly
depending on the number of efficient individuals. We show that, as N increases,
the frequency process of efficient individuals converges to a diffusion which
is a generalisation of the Wright- Fisher diffusion with selection. The
genealogy of this model is given by a branching-coalescing process that we call
the Ancestral Selection/Efficiency Graph, and that is an extension of the
Ancestral Selection Graph (Krone and Neuhauser (1997a), Krone and Neuhauser
(1997b)). The main contribution of this paper is that, in evolving populations,
inefficiency can arise as a promoter of selective advantage and not necessarily
as a trade-off.

the computer vision, and conventional methods take the holistic human body as

different body components (limbs and the torso) have distinctive
characteristics in terms of the moving pattern. In this paper, we argue local
representations on different body components should be learned separately and,
based on such idea, propose a network, Skeleton Network (SkelNet), for
long-term human motion prediction. Specifically, at each time-step, local
structure representations of input (human body) are obtained via SkelNet's
branches of component-specific layers, then the shared layer uses local spatial
representations to predict the future human pose. Our SkelNet is the first to
use local structure representations for predicting the human motion. Then, for
short-term human motion prediction, we propose the second network, named as
Skeleton Temporal Network (Skel-TNet). Skel-TNet consists of three components:
SkelNet and a Recurrent Neural Network, they have advantages in learning
spatial and temporal dependencies for predicting human motion, respectively; a
feed-forward network that outputs the final estimation. Our methods achieve
promising results on the Human3.6M dataset and the CMU motion capture dataset.

properties of quark-hadron many-body systems. The QNP is an international
conference which covers a wide range of hadron and nuclear physics, including
quark and gluon structure of hadrons, hadron spectroscopy, hadron interactions

First, I introduce the current status of the hadron and nuclear physics field
related to this conference. Next, the organization of the conference is
explained, and a brief overview of major recent developments is discussed by
selecting topics from discussions at the plenary sessions. They include
rapidly-developing field of gravitational waves and nuclear physics, hadron
interactions and nuclear structure with strangeness, lattice QCD, hadron
spectroscopy, nucleon structure, heavy-ion physics, hadrons in nuclear medium,
and experimental facilities of EIC, GSI-FAIR, JLab, J-PARC, Super-KEKB, and
others. Nuclear physics is at a fortunate time to push various projects at
these facilities. However, we should note that the projects need to be
developed together with related studies in other fields such as gravitational
physics, astrophysics, condensed-matter physics, particle physics, and
fundamental quantum physics.

First, for action frame localization, we take advantage of the self-attention
mechanism to weight each frame, such that the influence of background frames
can be effectively eliminated. Second, considering that there are trimmed
videos publicly available and also they contain useful information to leverage,
we present an additional module to transfer the knowledge from trimmed videos
for improving the classification performance in untrimmed ones. Extensive
experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets (i.e., THUMOS14 and
ActivityNet1.3), and experimental results clearly corroborate the efficacy of
our method.

to the phase transition between excitonic and electron-hole plasma states.
Herein, we show that through trap-state and band-edge engineering, bound

Under modest pumping conditions, these states enable stimulated emission
behaviour that exhibits a low threshold carrier density of only 1.6*1017 cm-3,

that bound exciton stimulated emission has been realised at room temperature

dynamic paired comparison model which uses a Gaussian Process (GP) as a prior
for the time dynamics rather than the Markovian dynamics usually assumed. In
addition, we show that the GP model can easily incorporate covariates. We
derive an efficient approximate Bayesian inference procedure based on the
Laplace Approximation and sparse linear algebra. We select hyperparameters by
maximising their marginal likelihood using Bayesian Optimisation, comparing the
results against random search. Finally, we fit and evaluate the model on the
2018 season of ATP tennis matches, where it performs competitively,
outperforming Elo and Glicko on log loss, particularly when surface covariates

  Meng","Meta-Weight-Net: Learning an Explicit Mapping For Sample Weighting","NeurIPS 2019",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Current deep neural networks (DNNs) can easily overfit to biased training
data with corrupted labels or class imbalance. Sample re-weighting strategy is
commonly used to alleviate this issue by designing a weighting function mapping
from training loss to sample weight, and then iterating between weight
recalculating and classifier updating. Current approaches, however, need
manually pre-specify the weighting function as well as its additional
hyper-parameters. It makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice
due to the significant variation of proper weighting schemes relying on the
investigated problem and training data. To address this issue, we propose a
method capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting function directly
from data. The weighting function is an MLP with one hidden layer, constituting
a universal approximator to almost any continuous functions, making the method
able to fit a wide range of weighting functions including those assumed in
conventional research. Guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data, the
parameters of the weighting function can be finely updated simultaneously with
the learning process of the classifiers. Synthetic and real experiments
substantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper weighting
functions in class imbalance and noisy label cases, fully complying with the
common settings in traditional methods, and more complicated scenarios beyond
conventional cases. This naturally leads to its better accuracy than other
state-of-the-art methods.

archetypal problem for illustrating statistical-computational tradeoffs. This
trend has largely been driven by a line of research aiming to characterize the
average-case complexity of sparse PCA through reductions from the planted
clique (PC) conjecture - which conjectures that there is no polynomial-time
algorithm to detect a planted clique of size $K = o(N^{1/2})$ in
$\mathcal{G}(N, \frac{1}{2})$. All previous reductions to sparse PCA either
fail to show tight computational lower bounds matching existing algorithms or
show lower bounds for formulations of sparse PCA other than its canonical
generative model, the spiked covariance model. Also, these lower bounds all
quickly degrade with the exponent in the PC conjecture. Specifically, when only
given the PC conjecture up to $K = o(N^\alpha)$ where $\alpha < 1/2$, there is
no sparsity level $k$ at which these lower bounds remain tight. If $\alpha \le
1/3$ these reductions fail to even show the existence of a
statistical-computational tradeoff at any sparsity $k$. We give a reduction
from PC that yields the first full characterization of the computational
barrier in the spiked covariance model, providing tight lower bounds at all
sparsities $k$. We also show the surprising result that weaker forms of the PC
conjecture up to clique size $K = o(N^\alpha)$ for any given $\alpha \in (0,
1/2]$ imply tight computational lower bounds for sparse PCA at sparsities $k =
o(n^{\alpha/3})$. This shows that even a mild improvement in the signal
strength needed by the best known polynomial-time sparse PCA algorithms would
imply that the hardness threshold for PC is subpolynomial. This is the first
instance of a suboptimal hardness assumption implying optimal lower bounds for
another problem in unsupervised learning.

Brownian ratchet model described by a single effective coordinate with multiple
electronic states in a dissipative environment. The rotational motion of the
motor system is investigated on the basis of wavepacket dynamics. A current
determined from the interplay between a fast photochemical isomerization
(photoisomerization) process triggered by pulses and a slow thermal
isomerization (thermalization) process arising from an overdamped environment
is numerically evaluated. For this purpose, we employ the multi-state
low-temperature quantum Smoluchowski equations that allow us to simulate the
fast quantum electronic dynamics in the overdamped environment. We analyze the
motor efficiency by numerically integrating the equations of motion for a
rotator system driven by repeatedly impulsive excitations. When the timescales
of the pulse repetition, photoisomerization, and thermalization processes are
separated, the average rotational speed of the motor is determined by the
timescale of thermalization. In this regime, the average rotational current can
be described by a simple equation derived from a rate equation for the
thermalization process. When laser pulses are applied repeatedly and the
timescales of the photoisomerization and pulse repetition are close, the
details of the photoisomerization process become important to analyze the
entire rotational process. We examine the possibility of observing the
photoisomerization and the thermalization processes associated with stationary
rotating dynamics of the motor system by spectroscopic means, e.g. pump-probe,
transient absorption, and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy techniques.

the curvature weighted approach and the convex relaxation method. Then an
alternating optimization strategy is applied with the merits of using some

their unique half-metallic band structures which exhibit high spin polarization
and yield huge magnetoresistance ratios. Besides serving as ferromagnetic
electrodes, Heusler alloys also have the potential to host spin-charge
conversion which has been recently demonstrated in other ferromagnetic metals.
Here, we report on the spin-charge conversion effect in the prototypical
Heusler alloy NiMnSb. Spin currents were injected from Y3Fe5O12 into NiMnSb
films by spin pumping, and then the spin currents were converted to charge
currents via spin-orbit interactions. Interestingly, an unusual charge signal
was observed with a sign change at low temperature, which can be manipulated by
film thickness and ordering structure. It is found that the spin-charge
conversion has two contributions. First, the interfacial contribution causes a
negative voltage signal, which is almost constant versus temperature. The
second contribution is temperature dependent because it is dominated by
minority states due to thermally excited magnons in the bulk part of the film.
This work provides a pathway for the manipulation of spin-charge conversion in
ferromagnetic metals by interface-bulk engineering for spintronic devices.

Recently, the interest in supersymmetry arises in the condensed matter
community owing to its potential emergence at the continuous quantum phase
transition. In this work, we demonstrate that 2+1D supersymmetry, relating
massive Majorana and Ising fields, might emerge at the first-order quantum
phase transition of the Ising magnetization by tuning a single parameter.
Although the emergence of the SUSY is only allowed in a finite range of scales
due to the existence of relevant masses, the scale range can be large when the
masses before scaling are small. We show that the emergence of supersymmetry is
accompanied by a topological phase transition for the Majorana field, where its
non-zero mass changes the sign but keeps the magnitude. An experimental
realization of this scenario is proposed using the surface state of a 3+1D
time-reversal invariant topological superconductor with surface magnetic
doping.

fashion, the download of mobile video, which is expected to comprise 75 % of
total mobile data traffic by 2020. The server can dynamically choose which
packets to download to clients, from among several packets which encode their
videos at different resolutions, as well as the power levels of their
transmissions. This allows it to control packet delivery probabilities, and
thereby, for example, avert imminent video outages at clients. It must however
respect the access point's constraints on bandwidth and average transmission
power. The goal is to maximize video ""Quality of Experience"" (QoE), which
depends on several factors such as (i) outage duration when the video playback
buffer is empty, (ii) number of outage periods, (iii) how many frames
downloaded are of lower resolution, (iv) temporal variations in resolution,
etc.
  It is shown that there exists an optimal decentralized solution where the AP
announces the price of energy, and each client distributedly and dynamically
maximizes its own QoE subject to the cost of energy. A distributed iterative
algorithm to solve for optimal decentralized policy is also presented. Further,
for the client-level QoE optimization, the optimal choice of video-resolution
and power-level of packet transmissions has a simple monotonicity and threshold
structure vis-a-vis video playback buffer level. When the number of orthogonal
channels is less than the number of clients, there is an index policy for
prioritizing packet transmissions. When the AP has to simply choose which
clients' packets to transmit, the index policy is asymptotically optimal as the
number of channels is scaled up with clients.

propose cognitive jamming for the monitor to change the suspicious link's
long-term belief on the parallel channels' distributions, and thereby induce it
to transmit more likely over a smaller subset of unjammed channels with a lower
transmission rate. As the half-duplex monitor cannot eavesdrop the channel that
it is simultaneously jamming to, our jamming design should also control the
probability of such ""own goal"" that occurs when the suspicious link chooses one
of the jammed (uneavesdroppable) channels to transmit. We formulate the optimal
jamming design problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming and show that
it is non-convex. Nevertheless, we prove that the monitor should optimally use
the maximum jamming power if it decides to jam, for maximally reducing
suspicious link's communication rate and driving the suspicious link out of the
jammed channels. Then we manage to simplify the MINLP to integer programming
and reveal a fundamental trade-off in deciding the number of jammed channels:
jamming more channels helps reduce the suspicious link's communication rate for
overhearing more clearly, but increases own goal probability and thus decreases
eavesdropping success probability. Finally, we extend our study to the two-way
suspicious communication scenario, and show there is another interesting
trade-off in deciding the common jammed channels for balancing bidirectional
eavesdropping performances. Numerical results show that our optimized
jamming-assisted eavesdropping scheme greatly increase eavesdropping success
probability as compared with the conventional passive eavesdropping.

appropriately defined, we demonstrate that valid statistical inference is
possible without assuming stationarity. As a working example, we consider
post-selection inference for regression coefficients under a random design

  We view this result as a step towards proving a conjecture of Friedgut, which
states that Boolean functions on the continuous cube $[0,1]^n$ (or,
equivalently, on $\{1,\dots,n\}^n$) can be biased using coalitions of $o(n)$
players. This is the first step taken in this direction since Friedgut proposed
the conjecture in 2004.
  Russell, Saks and Zuckerman extended the result of Kahn, Kalai and Linial to
multi-round protocols, showing that when the number of rounds is $o(\log^* n)$,
a coalition of $o(n)$ players can bias the outcome with respect to the uniform

$\{0,1\}^n$.
  The argument of Russell et al. relies on the fact that a coalition of $o(n)$
players can boost the expectation of any Boolean function from $\epsilon$ to
$1-\epsilon$ with respect to the uniform measure. This fails for general
product distributions, as the example of the AND function with respect to
$\mu_{1-1/n}$ shows. Instead, we use a novel boosting argument alongside a

inadequate to train a reliable classifier, and more seriously, some of these

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised learning paradigm that

insufficiency, we use a graph to bridge the data points so that the label
information can be propagated from the scarce labeled examples to unlabeled
examples along the graph edges. To address label inaccuracy, Graph Trend
Filtering (GTF) and Smooth Eigenbase Pursuit (SEP) are adopted to filter out
the initial noisy labels. GTF penalizes the l_0 norm of label difference
between connected examples in the graph and exhibits better local adaptivity
than the traditional l_2 norm-based Laplacian smoother. SEP reconstructs the
correct labels by emphasizing the leading eigenvectors of Laplacian matrix
associated with small eigenvalues, as these eigenvectors reflect real label
smoothness and carry rich class separation cues. We term our algorithm as
`Semi-supervised learning under Inadequate and Incorrect Supervision' (SIIS).
Thorough experimental results on image classification, text categorization, and
speech recognition demonstrate that our SIIS is effective in label error
correction, leading to superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods in
the presence of label noise and label scarcity.

consideration of active forces. Here, we derive expressions for the stress

proposed. It is based on the introduction of two different surrogate models and
an adaptive on-the-fly switching. The two concurrent surrogates are built
incrementally starting from a moderate set of evaluations of the full order
model. Therefore, a reduced order model (ROM) is generated. Using a hybrid
ROM-preconditioned FE solver, additional effective stress-strain data is
simulated while the number of samples is kept to a moderate level by using a
dedicated and physics-guided sampling technique. Machine learning (ML) is
subsequently used to build the second surrogate by means of artificial neural
networks (ANN). Different ANN architectures are explored and the features used
as inputs of the ANN are fine tuned in order to improve the overall quality of
the ML model. Additional ANN surrogates for the stress errors are generated.
Therefore, conservative design guidelines for error surrogates are presented by
adapting the loss functions of the ANN training in pure regression or pure
classification settings. The error surrogates can be used as quality indicators
in order to adaptively select the appropriate -- i.e. efficient yet accurate --
surrogate. Two strategies for the on-the-fly switching are investigated and a
practicable and robust algorithm is proposed that eliminates relevant technical
difficulties attributed to model switching. The provided algorithms and ANN
design guidelines can easily be adopted for different problem settings and,
thereby, they enable generalization of the used machine learning techniques for
a wide range of applications. The resulting hybrid surrogate is employed in
challenging multilevel FE simulations for a three-phase composite with
pseudo-plastic micro-constituents. Numerical examples highlight the performance

the emergence of digitalization and robo-advisors. This phenomenon affects
major financial services, including wealth management, employee savings plans,
asset managers, etc. Since the robo-advisory model is in its early stages, we
estimate that robo-advisors will help to manage around $1 trillion of assets in
2020 (OECD, 2017). And this trend is not going to stop with future generations,
who will live in a technology-driven and social media-based world. In the
investment industry, robo-advisors face different challenges: client profiling,
customization, asset pooling, liability constraints, etc. In its primary sense,
robo-advisory is a term for defining automated portfolio management. This
includes automated trading and rebalancing, but also automated portfolio
allocation. And this last issue is certainly the most important challenge for
robo-advisory over the next five years. Today, in many robo-advisors, asset
allocation is rather human-based and very far from being computer-based. The
reason is that portfolio optimization is a very difficult task, and can lead to
optimized mathematical solutions that are not optimal from a financial point of
view (Michaud, 1989). The big challenge for robo-advisors is therefore to be
able to optimize and rebalance hundreds of optimal portfolios without human
intervention. In this paper, we show that the mean-variance optimization
approach is mainly driven by arbitrage factors that are related to the concept
of hedging portfolios. This is why regularization and sparsity are necessary to
define robust asset allocation. However, this mathematical framework is more
complex and requires understanding how norm penalties impacts portfolio
optimization. From a numerical point of view, it also requires the
implementation of non-traditional algorithms based on ADMM methods.

shows that there is only one persistent (and perhaps slightly variable)
periodicity of 0.617 d of the light variations, with a double-wave light curve,
all other short periods having only transient character. Our suggestion that
this dominant period is the star's rotational period agrees with the estimated
stellar radius, projected rotational velocity and with the orbital inclination

disclosing it prompts serious threats to individuals' privacy. To limit such

indicate, e.g., how many people are in a location at a time interval, rather
than raw individual traces. In this paper, we perform a measurement study to
understand Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on aggregate location
time-series, where an adversary tries to infer whether a specific user
contributed to the aggregates.
  We find that the volume of contributed data, as well as the regularity and
particularity of users' mobility patterns, play a crucial role in the attack's
success. We experiment with a wide range of defenses based on generalization,
hiding, and perturbation, and evaluate their ability to thwart the attack
vis-a-vis the utility loss they introduce for various mobility analytics tasks.
  Our results show that some defenses fail across the board, while others work
for specific tasks on aggregate location time-series. For instance, suppressing
small counts can be used for ranking hotspots, data generalization for
forecasting traffic, hotspot discovery, and map inference, while sampling is
effective for location labeling and anomaly detection when the dataset is
sparse. Differentially private techniques provide reasonable accuracy only in
very specific settings, e.g., discovering hotspots and forecasting their
traffic, and more so when using weaker privacy notions like crowd-blending
privacy. Overall, our measurements show that there does not exist a unique
generic defense that can preserve the utility of the analytics for arbitrary
applications, and provide useful insights regarding the disclosure of sanitized

tetragonally distorted L2$_{1}$ one (i. e. to L1$_{0}$) causes significant
changes in the electronic structure of alloy, a drastic increase in alloy

that they may change their flavor identities through so-called fast-pairwise
conversions induced by mutual forward scatterings. If that is really the case,
the dynamics of supernova explosion will be influenced, since the conversion
may occur near the neutrino sphere, from which neutrinos are effectively
emitted. In this paper, we conduct a pilot study of such possibilities based on
the results of fully self-consistent, realistic simulations of a core-collapse
supernova explosion in two spatial dimensions under axisymmetry. As we solved
the Boltzmann equations for neutrino transfer in the simulation not as a
post-process but in real time, the angular distributions of neutrinos in
momentum space for all points in the core at all times are available, a
distinct feature of our simulations. We employ some of these distributions
extracted at a few selected points and times from the numerical data and apply
linear analysis to assess the possibility of the conversion. We focus on the
vicinity of the neutrino sphere, where different species of neutrinos move in
different directions and have different angular distributions as a result. This
is a pilot study for a more thorough survey that will follow soon. We find no
positive sign of conversion unfortunately at least for the spatial points and
times we studied in this particular model. We hence investigate rather in
detail the condition for the conversion by modifying the neutrino distributions

represents the probability of finding a nucleus at a given position in space
independent of the location of the other nuclei. In contrast to the full
many-dimensional nuclear probability density, the one-nucleus density contains
less information and may thus be better accessible by experiment, especially
for large molecules. It also provides a quantum-mechanical view of molecular

relatively small molecules, only certain vibrational excitations change the

collisionless, electrostatic and Maxwellian electron-ion plasma. The trapped
population of electrons is modeled based on well-known Schamel distribution
function. Head-on mutual collisions of nonlinear solutions are performed in
order to examine their collisional stability. The findings include three major
aspects: (I) These nonlinear solutions are found to be divided into three
categories based on their Mach numbers, i.e. stable, semi-stable and unstable.
Semi-stable solutions indicates a smooth transition from stable to unstable
solutions for increasing Mach number. (II) The stability of solutions is traced
back to a condition imposed on averaged velocities, i.e. net neutrality. It is
shown that a bipolar structure is produced in the flux of electrons,early in
the temporal evolution. This bipolar structure acts as the seed of the
net-neutrality instability, which tips off the energy balance of nonlinear
solution during collisions. As the Mach number increases, the amplitude of
bipolar structure grows and results in a stronger instability. (III) It is
established that during mutual collisions, a merging process of electron holes
can happen to a variety of degrees, based on their velocity characteristics.
Specifically, the number of rotations of electron holes around each other (in
the merging phase) varies. Furthermore, it is observed that in case of a
non-integer number of rotations, two electron holes exchange their phase space
cores.

solar-type stars is explored. Species are categorised into several types
according to their response to the outburst. The first and second types imply
chemical changes only during the outburst (with slightly different behaviours).
These response types are mostly observed close to the star and are caused by
icy mantle evaporation. However, mantles recover after the outburst almost
immediately. A notable exception is benzene ice, which is accumulated on dust
surfaces during and after the outburst, so that its abundance exceeds the
pre-outburst level by orders of magnitude. The third type of response is mostly
seen at the disc periphery and implies alteration of abundances during the
outburst and preservation of these `abnormal' abundances for centuries. This
behaviour is typical of organic compounds, like HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$CN, CH$_2$CO.
Their presence in the dark disc regions can be a manifestation of the past
outburst. CO and CO$_2$ only trace past outbursts at the remote disc regions.
The outburst changes the C/O ratio, but it quickly returns to the pre-outburst
value almost everywhere in the disc. An important factor determining the
sensitivity of molecular composition to the outburst is the dust size
distribution. The duration of the pre-outburst stage and of the outburst itself
influence the chemical effects, if the burst duration is shorter than 50 yr and
the duration of the quiescent phase between the bursts is shorter than 100 kyr.

that the positive weights are preserved. In the case of addition of a single
node, the derived inequalities that describe the regions where nodes can be
added are explicit. Besides addition of nodes these inequalities also yield an
algorithmic description of the replacement and removal of nodes. It is shown
that it is not always possible to add a single node while preserving positive
weights. On the other hand, addition of multiple nodes and preservation of
positive weights is always possible, although the minimum number of nodes that
need to be added can be as large as the number of nodes of the quadrature rule.
In case of addition of multiple nodes the inequalities describing the regions
where nodes can be added become implicit. It is shown that the well-known
Patterson extension of quadrature rules is a special case that forms the
boundary of these regions and various examples of the applicability of the
framework are discussed. By exploiting the framework, two new sets of
quadrature rules are proposed. Their performance is compared with the
well-known Gaussian and Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules, demonstrating the
advantages of our proposed nested quadrature rules with positive weights and
fine granularity.

promises for the engineering of non-abelian Majorana quasi-particles. A wide
class of systems expected to exhibit exotic correlations are based on nanoscale
conductors with strong spin-orbit interaction, subject to a strong external
magnetic field. The strength of the spin-orbit coupling is a crucial parameter
for the topological protection of Majorana modes as it forbids other trivial
excitations at low energy. The spin-orbit interaction is in principle intrinsic
to a material. As a consequence, experimental efforts have been recently
focused on semiconducting nano-conductors or spin-active atomic chains
contacted to a superconductor. Alternatively, we show how both a spin-orbit and
a Zeeman effect can be autonomously induced by using a magnetic texture coupled
to any low dimensional conductor, here a carbon nanotube. Transport
spectroscopy through superconducting contacts reveals oscillations of Andreev
like states under a change of the magnetic texture. These oscillations are well
accounted for by a scattering theory and are absent in a control device with no
magnetic texture. A large synthetic spin-orbit energy of about 1.1 meV, larger
than the intrinsic spin orbit energy in many other platforms, is directly
derived from the number of oscillations. Furthermore, a robust zero energy
state, the hallmark of devices hosting localized Majorana modes, emerges at
zero magnetic field. Our findings synthetize all the features for the emergence
of Majorana modes at zero magnetic field in a controlled, local and autonomous
fashion. It could be used for advanced experiments, including microwave
spectroscopy and braiding operations, which are at the heart of new schemes of
topological quantum computation.

use conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) to achieve generation of

that users could not discriminate generated signals and genuine ones and users

government commitments to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are insufficient by
far, actors such as institutional and private investors and the social movement
on divestment from fossil fuels could play an important role in putting

stochastic agent-based model of co-evolving financial market and investors'

that the dynamics of divestment from fossil fuels shows potential for social
tipping away from a fossil-fuel based economy. Our results further suggest that
socially responsible investors have leverage: a small share of 10--20\,\% of
such moral investors is sufficient to initiate the burst of the carbon bubble,
consistent with the Pareto Principle. These findings demonstrate that

discrepancies are more significant under the classification criteria of classic

overestimate SZ signal. By contrast, the ratio of $Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}/Y_{\rm SZ,

computational complexity theory and establish the natural measures for time and
space -- the number of beta-reductions and the size of the largest term in a
computation -- as reasonable measures with respect to the invariance thesis of
Slot and van Emde Boas [STOC~84]. More precisely, we show that, using those
measures, Turing machines and the weak call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus can
simulate each other within a polynomial overhead in time and a constant factor
overhead in space for all computations that terminate in (encodings) of 'true'
or 'false'. We consider this result as a solution to the long-standing open
problem, explicitly posed by Accattoli [ENTCS~18], of whether the natural
measures for time and space of the $\lambda$-calculus are reasonable, at least
in case of weak call-by-value evaluation.
  Our proof relies on a hybrid of two simulation strategies of reductions in
the weak call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus by Turing machines, both of which are
insufficient if taken alone. The first strategy is the most naive one in the
sense that a reduction sequence is simulated precisely as given by the
reduction rules; in particular, all substitutions are executed immediately.
This simulation runs within a constant overhead in space, but the overhead in
time might be exponential. The second strategy is heap-based and relies on
structure sharing, similar to existing compilers of eager functional languages.
This strategy only has a polynomial overhead in time, but the space consumption
might require an additional factor of $\log n$, which is essentially due to the
size of the pointers required for this strategy. Our main contribution is the
construction and verification of a space-aware interleaving of the two
strategies, which is shown to yield both a constant overhead in space and a
polynomial overhead in time.

easily accessible and cheap to obtain, but label noise might also have many
negative consequences if not accounted for. How to fully utilize noisy labels
has been studied extensively within the framework of standard supervised
machine learning over a period of several decades. However, very little
research has been conducted on solving the challenge posed by noisy labels in
non-standard settings. This includes situations where only a fraction of the
samples are labeled (semi-supervised) and each high-dimensional sample is
associated with multiple labels. In this work, we present a novel
semi-supervised and multi-label dimensionality reduction method that
effectively utilizes information from both noisy multi-labels and unlabeled
data. With the proposed Noisy multi-label semi-supervised dimensionality
reduction (NMLSDR) method, the noisy multi-labels are denoised and unlabeled
data are labeled simultaneously via a specially designed label propagation
algorithm. NMLSDR then learns a projection matrix for reducing the
dimensionality by maximizing the dependence between the enlarged and denoised
multi-label space and the features in the projected space. Extensive
experiments on synthetic data, benchmark datasets, as well as a real-world case
study, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that it
outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label feature extraction algorithms.

severely hindered in generalizing across different scanners and institutions.
In this paper, we present a novel patchbased Output Space Adversarial Learning
framework (pOSAL) to jointly and robustly segment the OD and OC from different
fundus image datasets. We first devise a lightweight and efficient segmentation
network as a backbone. Considering the specific morphology of OD and OC, a
novel morphology-aware segmentation loss is proposed to guide the network to
generate accurate and smooth segmentation. Our pOSAL framework then exploits
unsupervised domain adaptation to address the domain shift challenge by
encouraging the segmentation in the target domain to be similar to the source
ones. Since the whole-segmentationbased adversarial loss is insufficient to
drive the network to capture segmentation details, we further design the pOSAL
in a patch-based fashion to enable fine-grained discrimination on local
segmentation details. We extensively evaluate our pOSAL framework and
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the segmentation performance on
three public retinal fundus image datasets, i.e., Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and

In contrast to conventional PET reconstruction our method combines the
information from all detected events not only to reconstruct the dynamic
evolution of the radionuclide distribution, but also to improve the
reconstruction at each single time point by enforcing temporal consistency.
This is achieved via optimal transport regularization where in principle, among
all possible temporally evolving radionuclide distributions consistent with the
PET measurement, the one is chosen with least kinetic motion energy. The
reconstruction is found by convex optimization so that there is no dependence
on the initialization of the method. We study its behaviour on simulated data
of a human PET system and demonstrate its robustness even in settings with very
low radioactivity. In contrast to previously reported cell tracking algorithms,
our technique is oblivious to the number of tracked cells. Without any
additional complexity one or multiple cells can be reconstructed, and the model
automatically determines the number of particles. For instance, four
radiolabelled cells moving at a velocity of 3.1 mm/s and a PET recorded count
rate of 1.1 cps (for each cell) could be simultaneously tracked with a tracking
accuracy of 5.3 mm inside a simulated human body.

time posteriors alone, no unambiguous identification of a single mode is
possible. More in-depth analysis adopting a ringdown model based on results in

red giant stars and extract the corresponding time scales from the power
density spectra as well as the autocorrelation function of the BRITE time

seismic scaling relations, we use parameters from a large sample of Kepler

the granulation signal. We develop a method to identify which component is
measured if only one granulation component is statistically significant in the

sample stars, finding them to be consistent with those determined from the
autocorrelation signal of the time series. We further use radius estimates from
the literature to determine the stellar masses of our sample stars from the
measured surface gravities. We also define a statistical measure for the

incorporating liquid crystals (LCs) with graded index photonic crystal (GRIN
PC). The GRIN PC structures are composed of low refractive index polymer
annular rods having gradually varied radii of holes. To actively manipulate
incident light, the annular rods are infiltrated with nematic LCs. By applying
an external voltage to the infiltrated LCs, the effective index profile of the
low-index GRIN PC structure is modulated without introducing any mechanical
movement. The incident beam deflection and corresponding focal distance
modulation are tuned only by controlling the applied bias voltage. In the
present work, hyperbolic secant refractive index profile is chosen to design
GRIN PC structures. To design GRIN PC structure with annular PCs,
Maxwell-Garnett effective medium approximation is employed. Moreover, we
analytically express the relation between infiltrated LCs and gradient
parameter to show the physical background of the tuning ability of the proposed
devices. Also, beam steering and afocal zooming devices are analytically
investigated via geometrical optics and numerically realized with the help of
the finite-difference time-domain method. A beam deflection with an angle
change of {\Delta}{\theta}out= 44{\deg} and a light magnification with maximum
x2.15 are obtained. LCs are inexpensive materials and work under low
voltage/power condition. This feature can be used for designing an
electro-optic GRIN PC device that can be useful in various optical
applications.

significantly increase the capacity of secondary users (SUs). We derive the
false alarm probability and transmission outage probability for CRNs under our

the capacity of SUs under the MFH scheme. Numerical results show that our

a rotation evolution code to derive the properties of the formation and

be present even after the star reaches the main sequence phase. In a fast
rotator, this means that prominences can form until the star reaches $\sim 800$

many approaches have been described for this purpose, we look at the problem
here from the perspective of helicity preservation. Specifically, the
anti-reflection performance of nano-particle arrays on top of solar cell stacks
is related to two conditions: a high enough degree of discrete rotational
symmetry and the ability of the system to suppress cross-talk between the two
handednesses (helicities) of the electromagnetic field upon light-matter
interaction. For particle-lattice systems with high enough degree of discrete
rotational symmetry ($2\pi/n$ for $n>2$), our numerical studies link the
suppression of backscattering to the ability of the system to avoid the mixing
between the two helicity components of the incident field. In an exemplary
design, we use an array of TiO$_2$ disks placed on top of a flat heterojunction
solar cell stack, and analyze the helicity preservation properties of the
system. We show numerically that a hexagonal array lattice, featuring a higher
degree of discrete rotational symmetry, can improve over the anti-reflection
performance of a square lattice. Importantly, the disks are introduced in an
electrically decoupled manner such that the passivation and electric properties
of the device are not disturbed.

possibilities by varying the geometry of the cavity wall to ensure a nearly

are available, little is known about the details of mining pool behaviors
(e.g., empty blocks, mining revenue and transaction collection strategies) and
their effects on the Bitcoin end users (e.g., transaction fees, transaction
delay and transaction acceptance rate). This paper aims to fill this gap with a
systematic study of mining pools. We traced over 1.56 hundred thousand blocks
(including about 257 million historical transactions) from February 2016 to
January 2019 and collected over 120.25 million unconfirmed transactions from
March 2018 to January 2019. Then we conducted a board range of measurements on
the pool evolutions, labeled transactions (blocks) as well as real-time network
traffics, and discovered new interesting observations and features.
Specifically, our measurements show the following. 1) A few mining pools
entities continuously control most of the computing resources of the Bitcoin
network. 2) Mining pools are caught in a prisoner's dilemma where mining pools
compete to increase their computing resources even though the unit profit of
the computing resource decreases. 3) Mining pools are stuck in a Malthusian
trap where there is a stage at which the Bitcoin incentives are inadequate for
feeding the exponential growth of the computing resources. 4) The market price
and transaction fees are not sensitive to the event of halving block rewards.
5) The block interval of empty blocks is significantly lower than the block
interval of non-empty blocks. 6) Feerate plays a dominating role in transaction
collection strategy for the top mining pools. Our measurements and analysis

a legitimate but compromised participant manipulates the honest parties so that
the victim becomes unknowingly associated with a third party. These attacks are
well known, and resistance to misbinding is considered a critical requirement
for security protocols on the Internet. In the context of device pairing, on
the other hand, the attack has received little attention outside the
trusted-computing community. This paper points out that most device pairing
protocols are vulnerable to misbinding. Device pairing protocols are
characterized by lack of a-priory information, such as identifiers and
cryptographic roots of trust, about the other endpoint. Therefore, the devices
in pairing protocols need to be identified by the user's physical access to
them. As case studies for demonstrating the misbinding vulnerability, we use
Bluetooth and a protocol that registers new IoT devices to authentication
servers on wireless networks. We have implemented the attacks. We also show how
the attacks can be found in formal models of the protocols with carefully
formulated correspondence assertions. The formal analysis yields a new type of
double misbinding attack. While pairing protocols have been extensively
modelled and analyzed, misbinding seems to be an aspect that has not previously
received sufficient attention. Finally, we discuss potential ways to mitigate
the threat and its significance to security of pairing protocols.

around 8.2 and 10 K respectively. When magnetic fields are applied parallel to
the $c$ axis, metamagnetic transitions are observed at low temperatures,
corresponding to a magnetic field-induced phase transition. It is found that
the field-induced transition changes from second-order at higher temperatures,
to first-order at low temperatures, suggesting the existence of tricritical
points (TCPs) in both compounds. Since replacing Bi with Sb suppresses the TCP
to lower temperatures and corresponds to a positive chemical pressure, these
results suggest that applying pressure to Ce$_2$Sb may suppress the TCP to
lower temperatures, potentially to zero temperature at a quantum tricritical
point.

Recently, Funke and Sanders (2017) presented a divide-and-conquer DT algorithm
that merges two partial triangulations by re-triangulating a small subset of
their vertices - the border vertices - and combining the three triangulations
efficiently via parallel hash table lookups. The input point division should
therefore yield roughly equal-sized partitions for good load-balancing and also
result in a small number of border vertices for fast merging. In this paper, we
present a novel divide-step based on partitioning the triangulation of a small

non-data-sensitive division schemes on inputs exhibiting an exploitable

  Our main result is a generic reduction that transforms any quantum dishonest

underlying sigma-protocol (in the standard model). Applied to the standard
soundness and proof-of-knowledge definitions, our reduction implies that both

quantum attacks. Our result improves and completes the partial results that

  In the context of post-quantum secure signature schemes, our results imply
that for any sigma-protocol that is a proof-of-knowledge against quantum
dishonest provers (and that satisfies some additional natural properties), the
corresponding Fiat-Shamir signature scheme is secure in the quantum

performances. We perform a full electro-optical characterization of the curved
detectors, by measuring the gain, the full well capacity, the dynamic-range and
the noise properties, such as dark current, readout noise,
pixel-relative-non-uniformity. We repeat the same process for the flat version
of the same CMOS sensor, as a reference for comparison. We find no significant
difference among most of the characterization values of the curved and flat
samples. We obtain values of readout noise of 10e$^-$ for the curved samples

dynamic ranges for the curved detectors. Additionally we measure consistently
smaller values of dark current compared to the flat CMOS sensor. The curving

We detected a cluster of 25 continuum sources, most of which are likely tracing
disks around Class 0/I protostars. Excluding the two most massive objects,
disks masses are in the range 0.003-0.05 Msun. The analysis of the cluster
properties indicates that GGD27 displays moderate subclustering. This result
combined with the dynamical timescale of the radio jet (10000 years) suggests
the youthfulness of the cluster. The lack of disk mass segregation signatures
may support this too. We found a clear paucity of disks with Rdisk >100 au. The
median value of the radius is 34 au, smaller than the median of 92 au for
Taurus but comparable to the value found in Ophiuchus and in the Orion Nebula
Cluster. In GGD27 there is no evidence of a distance-dependent disk mass
distribution (i. e., disk mass depletion due to external photoevaporation),
most likely due to the cluster youth. There is a clear deficit of disks for
distances <0.02 pc. Only for distances >0.04 pc stars can form larger and more
massive disks, suggesting that dynamical interactions far from the cluster
center are weaker, although the small disks found could be the result of disk
truncation. This work demonstrates the potential to characterize disks from

insufficient or limited number of high-dose projections. In both cases the
angular sampling is assumed to be isotropic, and the photon budget throughout
the experiment is fixed based on the maximum allowable radiation dose on the

protein oscillator design - the repressilator - and investigate its robustness
to pulse perturbations, computationally as well as using analytical tools of
Floquet theory. We find that the metric provided by direct computations of the
time it takes for the oscillator to settle after a pulse perturbation is
applied, correlates well with the metric provided by Floquet theory. We
investigate the parametric dependence of the Floquet metric, finding that the
parameters that increase the effective delay enhance robustness to pulse
perturbation. We find that the structural changes such as increasing the number
of proteins in a ring oscillator as well as adding positive feedback, both of
which increase effective delay, facilitates such robustness. These results
highlight such design principles, especially the role of delay, for designing
an oscillator that is robust to pulse perturbation.

= volume' (CV) conjecture. First, it seems that there is a universal property:
the superconducting phase always has a smaller complexity than the unstable
normal phase below the critical temperature, which is similar to a free energy.
We investigate the temperature dependence of the complexity. In the low
temperature limit, the complexity (of formation) scales as $T^\alpha$, where
$\alpha$ is a function of the complex scalar mass $m^2$, the $U(1)$ charge $q$,
and dimension $d$. In particular, for $m^2=0$, we find $\alpha=d-1$,
independent of $q$, which can be explained by the near horizon geometry of the
low temperature holographic superconductor. Next, we develop a general
numerical method to compute the time-dependent complexity by the CV conjecture.
By this method, we compute the time-dependent complexity of holographic
superconductors. In both normal and superconducting phase, the complexity
increases as time goes on and the growth rate saturates to a temperature
dependent constant. The higher the temperature is, the bigger the growth rate
is. However, the growth rates do not violate the Lloyd's bound in all cases and
saturate the Lloyd's bound in the high temperature limit at a late time.

mesonic fields realized through the density dependent coupling strengths. The
central depletion in deformed nuclei tends to disappear irrespective of the
occupancy of $2s_{1/2}$ state in contrast to the spherical nuclei in which the
unoccupancy of $2s_{1/2}$ state leads to the central depletion. Due to the
differences in the strength of spin-orbit potentials in these models, the
central depletions are found to be model dependent. The influence of the
central depletion on the neutron-skin thickness is also investigated. It
appears that the effects of the central depletion do not percolate far enough
to display its finger prints on the trends of the neutron-skin thickness.

hyperspectral images measured by remote sensors. Most of the spectral unmixing
algorithms are developed using the linear mixing models. To estimate endmembers
and fractional abundance matrices in a blind problem, nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF) and its developments are widely used in the SU problem. One
of the constraints which was added to NMF is sparsity, that was regularized by
Lq norm. In this paper, a new algorithm based on distributed optimization is
suggested for spectral unmixing. In the proposed algorithm, a network including
single-node clusters is employed. Each pixel in the hyperspectral images is
considered as a node in this network. The sparsity constrained distributed
unmixing is optimized with diffusion least mean p-power (LMP) strategy, and
then the update equations for fractional abundance and signature matrices are
obtained. Afterwards the proposed algorithm is analyzed for different values of
LMP power and Lq norms. Simulation results based on defined performance metrics
illustrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm in spectral unmixing of
hyperspectral data compared with other methods.

ubiquitous in the real world. How does the non-Markovian characteristic affect
failure propagation in complex networks? We consider failures due to internal
causes at the nodal level and external failures due to an adverse environment,
and develop a pair approximation analysis taking into account the two-node
correlation. In general, a high failure stationary state can arise,
corresponding to large-scale failures that can significantly compromise the
functioning of the network. We uncover a striking phenomenon: memory associated
with nodal recovery can counter-intuitively make the network more resilient
against large-scale failures. In natural systems, the intrinsic non-Markovian
characteristic of nodal recovery may thus be one reason for their resilience.
In engineering design, incorporating certain non-Markovian features into the

study the strain adaption mechanism in a thin film model system as function of

buffer layers, which allow for large variation of the preset lattice constants,
e.g. epitaxial boundary condition. It is shown by means of high resolution
X-ray reciprocal space maps and transmission electron microscopy that the
system reacts with a tilting mechanism of the structural units in order to
adapt to the lattice constants of the buffer layer. This response explained by
density functional theory calculations, which evidence an energetic minimum for
structures with a distortion of c/a =0.87. The experimentally observed tilting
mechanism is induced by this energy gain and allows the system to remain in the
most favorable structure. In general, it is shown that the use of epitaxial
model heterostructures consisting of alloy buffer layers of fully miscible
elements and the functional material of interest allows to study strain
adaption behaviors in great detail. This approach makes even small secondary
effects observable, such as the directional tilting of the structural domains

the 2MASS $JHK_{\rm S}$ bands and the short-wavelength bands of Spitzer.
Meanwhile, the inhomogeneous extinction causes the P-L relation scattering in
the $V$ band, and the dust emission causes the less tight P-L relation in the
Spitzer/[8.0] and [24] bands. The derived P-L relations in the 2MASS/$K_{\rm

for such events has been made using the Time Projection Chambers of ND280,
where the background has been reduced to less than two events in the current
dataset in all channels. No excess has been observed in the signal region. A
combined Bayesian statistical approach has been applied to extract upper limits
on the mixing elements of heavy neutrinos to electron-, muon- and tau-
flavoured currents ($U_e^2$, $U_{\mu}^2$, $U_{\tau}^2$) as a function of the
heavy neutrino mass, e.g. $U_e^2 < 10^{-9}$ at $90\%$ C.L. for a mass of $390$

pattern-matching indexes designed for repetitive text collections achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in space. Instead, there are not many analogous

the $ndoc$ distinct documents where a pattern of length $m$ appears in time
$\mathcal{O}(m+ndoc \cdot \log n)$. We exploit the repetitiveness of the
document array (i.e., the suffix array coarsened to document identifiers) to
grammar-compress it while precomputing the answers to nonterminals, and store
them in grammar-compressed form as well. Our experimental results show that our
index sharply outperforms existing alternatives in the space/time tradeoff map.

density-based machine learning clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, OPTICS, and
HDBSCAN) to a sample drawn from the Gaia catalogue centred on the Ophiuchus
cloud. The clustering analysis was applied in the five astrometric dimensions
defined by the three-dimensional Cartesian space and the proper motions in
right ascension and declination. The three clustering algorithms systematically
identify a similar set of candidate members in a main cluster with astrometric
properties consistent with those of the control sample. The increased
flexibility of the OPTICS and HDBSCAN algorithms enable these methods to
identify a secondary cluster. We constructed a common sample containing 391
member candidates including 166 new objects, which have not yet been discussed
in the literature. By combining the Gaia data with 2MASS and WISE photometry,
we built the spectral energy distributions from 0.5 to $22\microm$ for a subset

sub-type is around 1 sub-type and the uncertainty of the luminosity class is
around 1 level. However, about 40\% of the OB stars are failed to be assigned
to any class by MKCLASS and a few spectra are significantly misclassified by
MKCLASS. This is likely because that the template spectra of MKCLASS are
selected from nearby stars in the solar neighborhood, while the OB stars in
this work are mostly located in the outer disk and may have lower metallicity.
The rotation of the OB stars may also be responsible for the
mis-classifications. Moreover, we find that the spectral and luminosity classes

substantially different with those located in latitude smaller than 20$^\circ$,

between modern applications and main memory, composed of DRAM chips.
Manufacturers are now selling and proposing many different types of DRAM, with
each DRAM type catering to different needs (e.g., high throughput, low power,
high memory density). At the same time, the memory access patterns of prevalent
and emerging workloads are rapidly diverging, as these applications manipulate
larger data sets in very different ways. As a result, the combined
DRAM-workload behavior is often difficult to intuitively determine today, which
can hinder memory optimizations in both hardware and software.
  In this work, we identify important families of workloads, as well as
prevalent types of DRAM chips, and rigorously analyze the combined
DRAM--workload behavior. To this end, we perform a comprehensive experimental
study of the interaction between nine different DRAM types and 115 modern
applications and multiprogrammed workloads. We draw 12 key observations from
our characterization, enabled in part by our development of new metrics that
take into account contention between memory requests due to hardware design.
Notably, we find that (1) newer DRAM types such as DDR4 and HMC often do not
outperform older types such as DDR3, due to higher access latencies and, in the
case of HMC, poor exploitation of locality; (2) there is no single DRAM type
that can cater to all components of a heterogeneous system (e.g., GDDR5
significantly outperforms other memories for multimedia acceleration, while HMC
significantly outperforms other memories for network acceleration); and (3)
there is still a strong need to lower DRAM latency, but unfortunately the
current design trend of commodity DRAM is toward higher latencies to obtain
other benefits. We hope that the trends we identify can drive optimizations in
both hardware and software design.

acceleration-based robust position control of robot manipulators by using
Disturbance Observer (DOb). It is shown that if the nominal inertia matrix is
properly tuned in the design of DOb, then the position error asymptotically
goes to zero in regulation control and is uniformly ultimately bounded in
trajectory tracking control. As the bandwidth of DOb and the nominal inertia
matrix are increased, the bound of error shrinks, i.e., the robust stability
and performance of the position control system are improved. However, neither
the bandwidth of DOb nor the nominal inertia matrix can be freely increased due
to practical design constraints, e.g., the robust position controller becomes
more noise sensitive when they are increased. The proposed stability analysis
provides insights regarding the dynamic behavior of DOb-based robust motion
control systems. It is theoretically and experimentally proved that
non-diagonal elements of the nominal inertia matrix are useful to improve the
stability and adjust the trade-off between the robustness and noise
sensitivity. The validity of the proposal is verified by simulation and
experimental results.

dietary self-reported data there is increased interest in the use of dietary
biomarkers as objective measures of intake. Furthermore, there is a growing
consensus of the need to combine dietary biomarker data with self-reported
data.
  A review of state of the art techniques employed when combining biomarker and
self-reported data is conducted. Two predominant methods, the calibration
method and the method of triads, emerge as relevant techniques used when
combining biomarker and self-reported data to account for measurement errors in
dietary intake assessment. Both methods crucially assume measurement error
independence. To expose and understand the performance of these methods in a
range of realistic settings, their underpinning statistical concepts are
unified and delineated, and thorough simulation studies conducted.
  Results show that violation of the methods' assumptions negatively impacts
resulting inference but that this impact is mitigated when the variation of the
biomarker around the true intake is small. Thus there is much scope for the
further development of biomarkers and models in tandem to achieve the ultimate
goal of accurately assessing dietary intake.

large gains in terms of the rate, however at the cost of subpacketization that
is exponential in $K^{\frac{1}{r}}$ ($K$ being the number of clients, $r$ some
positive integer). Building upon recent prior work for coded caching design via
line graphs and finite-field projective geometries, we present a new scheme in
this work which achieves a subexponential (in $K$) subpacketization of
$q^{O((log_qK)^2)}$ and rate $\Theta\left(\frac{K}{(log_qK)^2}\right)$, for
large $K$, and the cached fraction $\frac{M}{N}$ being upper bounded by a
constant $\frac{2}{q^{\alpha-1}}$ (for some prime power $q$ and constant
$\alpha \geq 2$) . Apart from this asymptotic improvement, we show that through
some numerical comparisons that our present scheme has much lower
subpacketization than previous comparable schemes, with some increase in the
rate of the delivery scheme, for the same memory requirements. For instance, we
obtain practically relevant subpacketization levels such as $10^2 - 10^7$ for
$10^2 - 10^4$ number of clients. Leveraging prior results on adapting coded

antenna of infinite length, with application to the finite-length antenna. We
discuss our results in connection with the perfectly conducting antenna,
providing perturbative corrections to the current distribution for a large
conductance, as well as presenting a delta-sequence and the field of a Hertzian
dipole for the effective current in the limit of vanishing conductance. To that
end, we employ both analytical tools and numerical methods to compare with
experimental results.

by utilizing feedforward neural networks. Although still in the shape of a

  Physiological Advantages in Plant Defence Mechanisms","69 pages, 7 figures, 2 Tables",,,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kinos are plant exudates, rich in polyphenols, produced by several
angiosperms in reaction to damage. They flow out of kino veins,
schizolysigenous ducts composing an anatomically distinct continuous system of
tangentially anastomosing lacunae produced by the vascular cambium, which
encircle the plant. Kino is secreted holocrinously into the vein lumen by a
cambiform epithelium lined by suberized cells that separate kino veins from the
surrounding axial parenchyma. A model describing kino flow in eucalypts is
presented to investigate how vein distribution and structure, as well as kino
holocrine loading, crystallization, and viscosity affect flow. Considering
viscosity, vein anatomy, and a time-dependent holocrine loading of kino, the
unsteady Stokes equation was applied. Qualitatively, kino flow is similar to
resin flow. There is an increase in flow towards the vein open end, and both
pressure and flow depend on vein dimensions, kino properties and holocrine
loading. However, kino veins present a much smaller specific resistance to flow
compared to resin ducts. Also, unlike resin loading in conifers, holocrine kino
loading is not pressure-driven. The pressure and pressure gradient required to
drive an equally fast flow are smaller than what is observed on the resin ducts
of conifers. These results agree with previous observations on some angiosperms
and suggest that holocrinous gum flow may have lower metabolic energy costs;
thus presenting physiological advantages and possibly constituting an
evolutionary step of angiosperms in using internal secretory systems in plant
defence mechanisms compared to resin flow in conifers. Understanding of how
these physiological and morphological parameters affect kino flow might be
useful for selecting species and developing more sustainable and economically
viable methods of tapping gum and gum resin in angiosperms.

  Application to Non-isothermal Nematic Liquid Crystals","29 pages",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To most existing non-equilibrium theories, the modeling of non-isothermal
processes was a hard task. Intrinsic difficulties involved the non-equilibrium
temperature, the coexistence of conserved energy and dissipative entropy, etc.
In this paper, by taking the non-isothermal flow of nematic liquid crystals as
a typical example, we illustrated that thermodynamically consistent models in
either vectorial or tensorial forms could be constructed within the framework
of Conservation-Dissipation Formalism (CDF). And the classical isothermal
Ericksen-Leslie model and Qian-Sheng model were shown to be special cases of
our new vectorial and tensorial models in the isothermal, incompressible and
stationary limit. Most importantly, from above examples, it was learnt that
mathematical modeling based on CDF could easily solve the issues relating with
non-isothermal situations in a systematic way. The first and second laws of
thermodynamics were satisfied simultaneously. The non-equilibrium temperature
was defined self-consistently through the partial derivative of entropy
function. Relaxation-type constitutive relations were constructed, which gave
rise to the classical linear constitutive relations, like Newton's law and
Fourier's law, in stationary limits. Therefore, CDF was expected to have a
broad scope of applications in soft matter physics, especially under the
complicated situations, such as non-isothermal, compressible and nanoscale
systems.

Dark-bright entities are spontaneously generated for quenches towards the phase
separated regime and dark-antidark states are formed in the reverse process.
The distinct mechanisms of creation of the aforementioned states are discussed

is found that the number of solitary waves generated is larger for larger
particle imbalances, a result that is enhanced for stronger postquench
interspecies interactions. Additionally the confining geometry highly affects
the production of both types of states with a decaying solitary wave formation
occurring for tighter traps. Furthermore, in both of the aforementioned

obviates the need to employ complex heartbeat monitors such as
Electrocardiogram or Photoplethysmogram. Indeed, our experiments show that
piezo sensors can measure heartbeat intervals on many different body locations

that the heartbeat interval signal captured by piezo vibration sensors has low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) because they are not designed as precision
heartbeat monitors, which becomes the key challenge for H2B. To overcome this
problem, we first apply a quantile function-based quantization method to fully
extract the useful entropy from the noisy piezo measurements. We then propose a
novel Compressive Sensing-based reconciliation method to correct the high bit
mismatch rates between the two independently generated keys caused by low SNR.
We prototype H2B using off-the-shelf piezo sensors and evaluate its performance
