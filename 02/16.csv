High-Density Carbon indirect drive designs of the National Ignition Facility
for three regimes of alpha-heating - self-heating, robust ignition and
propagating burn - exploring hotspot power balance, perturbations and
hydrodynamic scaling. A Monte-Carlo Particle-in-Cell charged particle transport
package for the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Chimera was developed for
this work. Hotspot power balance between alpha-heating, electron thermal
conduction and radiation was studied in 1D for each regime, and the impact of
perturbations on this power balance explored in 3D using a single
Rayleigh-Taylor spike. Heat flow into the spike from thermal conduction and
alpha-heating increases by $\sim2-3\times$, due to sharper temperature
gradients and increased proximity of the cold, dense material to the main
fusion regions respectively. The radiative contribution remains largely
unaffected in magnitude. Hydrodynamic scaling with capsule size and laser
energy of two perturbation scenarios (a short-wavelength multi-mode & a
low-mode radiation asymmetry) is explored in 3D, demonstrating the differing
hydrodynamic evolution of the three alpha-heating regimes. The multi-mode yield
increases faster with scale factor due to more synchronous $PdV$ compression
producing higher temperatures and densities, and hence stronger bootstrapping.
Effects on the hydrodynamic evolution are clearer for stronger alpha-heating
regimes and include: reduced perturbation growth due to ablation from
fire-polishing and stronger thermal conduction; sharper temperature and density
gradients; and increased hotspot pressures which further compress the shell,
increase hotspot size and induce faster re-expansion. Faster expansion into
regions of weak confinement is more prominent for stronger alpha-heating
regimes, and can result in loss of confinement.

Dirac and Weyl modes beyond the conventional high energy paradigm. Yet, finding
real materials naturally hosting these excitations at the Fermi energy has
remained challenging. Here we show that twisted bilayer graphene is a versatile
platform to realize robust triple point fermions in two dimensions. In
particular, we establish that the introduction of localized impurities lifts
one of the two degenerate Dirac cones, yielding triple point fermions at charge
neutrality. Furthermore, we show that the valley polarization is preserved for
certain impurity locations in the moire supercell for both weak and strong
impurity potentials. We finally show that in the presence of interactions, a
symmetry broken state with local magnetization can develop out of the triple
point bands, which can be selectively controlled by electrostatic gating. Our
results put forward twisted bilayer graphene as a simple solid-state platform
to realize triple point fermions at charge neutrality, and demonstrate the
non-trivial role of impurities in moire systems.

machine such that the total number of tardy jobs is minimized. The machine can
simultaneously process several jobs as a batch as long as the machine capacity
is not violated. The batch processing time is equal to the largest processing
time among those jobs in the batch. Two decisions are made to schedule jobs on
the batch processing machine, namely grouping jobs to form batches and
sequencing the batches on the machines. Both the decisions are interdependent
as the composition of the batch affects the processing time of the batch. The
problem under study is NP-hard. Consequently, solving a mathematical
formulation to find an optimal solution is computationally intensive. A Greedy
Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) is proposed to solve the problem
under study with the assumption of arbitrary job sizes, arbitrary processing
times and arbitrary due dates. A novel construction phase for the GRASP
approach is proposed to improve the solution quality. In addition, a path
relinking procedure is proposed for solving large-sized problems effectively.
The performance of the proposed GRASP approach is evaluated by comparing its
results to a commercial solver (which was used to solve the mathematical model)
and a construction heuristic. Experimental studies suggest that the solution
obtained from the GRASP approach is superior compared to the commercial solver
and the construction heuristic.

to centuries, represent one of the keys to the understanding of the processes
leading to the differentiation of stellar rotation.
  Aims. We characterise the variations of the magnetic field of the Ap star HD
50169 and derive constraints about its structure.
  Methods. We combine published measurements of the mean longitudinal field
<Bz> of HD 50169 with new determinations of this field moment from circular
spectropolarimetry obtained at the 6-m telescope BTA of the Special
Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. For the mean
magnetic field modulus <B>, literature data are complemented by the analysis of
ESO spectra, both newly acquired and from the archive. Radial velocities are
also obtained from these spectra.
  Results. We present the first determination of the rotation period of HD
50169, Prot = (29.04+/-0.82) y. HD 50169 is currently the longest-period Ap
star for which magnetic field measurements have been obtained over more than a
full cycle. The variation curves of both <Bz> and <B> have a significant degree
of anharmonicity, and there is a definite phase shift between their respective
extrema. We confirm that HD 50169 is a wide spectroscopic binary, refine its
orbital elements, and suggest that the secondary is probably a dwarf star of
spectral type M.
  Conclusions. The shapes and mutual phase shifts of the derived magnetic
variation curves unquestionably indicate that the magnetic field of HD 50169 is
not symmetric about an axis passing through its centre. Overall, HD 50169
appears similar to the bulk of the long-period Ap stars.

computing abstraction that makes it easier to write robust, large-scale web
services. In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless
functions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system,
resource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand for the
service spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware to the
service and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently
deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it
transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services
introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions
are now available on all major cloud computing platforms.
  Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level
operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about
their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting
$\lambda_\Lambda$, an operational semantics of the essence of serverless
computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, $\lambda_\Lambda$
models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show
that $\lambda_\Lambda$ is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease
reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless
execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and
$\lambda_\Lambda$ coincide. Second, we augment $\lambda_\Lambda$ with a
key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third,
since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function
composition, we show how to extend $\lambda_\Lambda$ with a composition
language. We have implemented this composition language and show that it
outperforms prior work.

restricting the length of augmenting paths to at most three. The algorithm has
time complexity $O(m \log \Delta + n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of
vertices, $m$ is the number of edges, and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of a

  The approximation ratio of the algorithm is obtained by considering failed

the exact algorithm does. We show that there are two distinct heavier matched
vertices that we can charge each failed vertex to. Our proof techniques
characterize the structure of augmenting paths in a novel way.

moir\'e effect can be especially strong for interlayer excitons, where
electrons and holes reside in different layers and can be addressed separately.
In particular, it was recently proposed that the moir\'e superlattice potential
not only localizes interlayer exciton states at different superlattice
positions, but also hosts an emerging moir\'e quasi-angular momentum (QAM) that
periodically switches the optical selection rules for interlayer excitons at
different moir\'e sites. Here we report the observation of multiple interlayer
exciton states coexisting in a WSe2/WS2 moir\'e superlattice and unambiguously
determine their spin, valley, and moir\'e QAM through novel resonant optical
pump-probe spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. We
demonstrate that interlayer excitons localized at different moir\'e sites can
exhibit opposite optical selection rules due to the spatially-varying moir\'e
QAM. Our observation reveals new opportunities to engineer interlayer exciton

an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the sensors' required energy
while guaranteeing their required information transmissions and processing
rates by jointly optimizing the multi-user scheduling, the time assignment, the
sensors' transmit powers and the PS ratios. Since the problem is a mixed
integer programming (MIP) problem and cannot be solved with existing solution
methods, we solve it by applying problem decomposition, variable substitutions
and theoretical analysis. For a scheduled sensor, the closed-form and
semi-closedform solutions to achieve its minimal required energy are derived,
and then an efficient multi-user scheduling scheme is presented, which can
achieve the suboptimal user scheduling with low computational complexity.
Numerical results demonstrate our obtained theoretical results, which show that
for each sensor, when it is located close to the HAP or the fog server (FS),
the fog offloading mode is the better choice; otherwise, the local computing
mode should be selected. The system performances in a frame-by-frame manner are
also simulated, which show that using the energy stored in the batteries and
that harvested from the signals transmitted by previous scheduled sensors can
further decrease the total required energy of the sensors.

Hamiltonian in this limit, obtained by a similarity transformation, is a

the possibilities of d-wave pairing and extended s-wave pairing superconducting
(SC) phases on a two dimensional square lattice at zero temperature within a
Gutzwiller projected renormalized mean field theory. In the sector of solutions
that forbid spin ordering, the system shows a finite non-zero d-wave as well as
extended s-wave pairing amplitude for $\Delta \sim U \gg t$. The width of the
superconducting phase in $U-\Delta$ regime shrinks with increase in $U$ and
$\Delta$, though the extended s-wave pairing phase is higher in energy than the
d-wave pairing superconducting phase. But in a spin resolved renormalized mean
field calculation, which allows for an antiferromagnetic (AF) order along with
the d-wave or extended s-wave pairing, the SC phase is no longer viable and the
system shows a direct transition from an AF ordered phase to a paramagnetic
band insulator. Except for a thin sliver of a half-metallic AF phase close to
the AF transition point, most of the AF ordered phase is a Mott insulator. We
benchmarked the AF Mott insulator to band insulator transition within the
Gutzwiller projected renormalized mean field theory against the dynamical mean
field theory (DMFT) solved using continuous time quantum Monte-Carlo (CTQMC).
Our work suggests that the ground state phase diagram of the IHM at
half-filling in the limit of extreme correlations does not have any SC phase.
The SC phase seen in the paramagnetic sector is a metastable phase, being
higher in energy than the AF Mott insulator phase.

  Brown, Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s showed that the maximum number of edges of such

problem to determine the correct exponent of $n$.
  Among other results, we improve the above lower bound by showing that
  $$f_r(n,v,e)=\Omega(n^{\frac{er-v}{e-1}}(\log n)^{\frac{1}{e-1}})$$

election outcome is constrained by interval constraints -- of the form ""Between
3 and 5 candidates with label X"" -- and dominance constraints -- ""At least as
many candidates with label X as with label Y"". The problem is, what shall we do
if the committee selected by a given voting rule fails these constraints? In
this paper we argue how the logic underlying weakly-separable and best-$k$
rules can be extended into an ordering of committees, and study the question of
how to select the best valid committee with respect to this order. The problem
is NP-hard, but we show the existence of a polynomial time solution in the case

a giant valley exciton splitting of 18 meV/T for monolayer WS2, using the
proximity effect from a ferromagnetic EuS substrate, which is enhanced by
nearly two orders of magnitude from the 0.2 meV/T obtained by an external
magnetic field. More interestingly, a sign reversal of the valley exciton
splitting is observed as compared to that of WSe2 on EuS. Using first
principles calculations, we investigate the complex behavior of exchange
interactions between TMDs and EuS, that is qualitatively different from the
Zeeman effect. The sign reversal is attributed to competing ferromagnetic (FM)
and antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange interactions for Eu- and S- terminated EuS
surface sites. They act differently on the conduction and valence bands of WS2
compared to WSe2. Tuning the sign and magnitude of the valley exciton splitting
offers opportunities for versatile control of valley pseudospin for quantum
information processing.

commercial CMOS technology. By fully integrating both analog and digital
readout-circuitry on the same particle-detecting substrate, current challenges
of hybrid sensor technologies, i.e., larger readout input-capacitance, lower
production-yield, and higher production and integration cost, can be
downscaled. The large electrode design using high-resistivity substrates
actively helps to mitigate the charge-trapping effects, making these chips
radiation hard. The surface and bulk damage induced in high irradiation
environment change the effective doping concentration of the device, which
modulates high electric fields as the reverse-bias voltage increases. This
effect can cause high leakage current and premature electrical breakdown,
driven by impact ionization. In order to assess the characteristics of heavily
irradiated samples, we have carried out dedicated campaigns on ATLASPix1 chips
that included irradiations of neutrons and protons, made at different
facilities. Here, we report on the electrical characterization of the
irradiated samples at different ambient conditions, also in comparison to their

can be safely operated at a voltage high enough to allow for high efficiency,
up to the fluence of 2E15 neq/cm2, beyond the radiation levels (TID and NIEL)

investigate the causal role of DLPFC in implicit contextual memory-guided
attention. We aimed to test whether transient disruption of the DLPFC would
interfere with implicit learning performance and related electrical brain

as a control region prior to the performance of an implicit contextual learning
task. We found that cTBS applied over the DLPFC significantly improved
performance during implicit contextual learning. We also noted that beta-band

Taken together, our results provide evidence that DLPFC-mediated top-down

Galactic Nuclei (AGN). An AGN can eject winds, jets, and produce radiation
across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The fraction of the bolometric
emission in the radio spans a factor of ~10^5 across the different AGN classes.
The weakest radio sources, radio-quiet (RQ) AGN, are typically 1,000 times
fainter than the radio-loud (RL) AGN, and represent the majority of the AGN
population. In RL AGN, radio emission is essentially all produced by
synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet. In contrast, in RQ AGN the
absence of luminous jets allows us to probe radio emission from a wide range of
possible mechanisms, from the host galaxy kpc scale down to the innermost
region near the SMBHs: star formation, AGN driven wind, free-free emission from
photo-ionized gas, low power jet, and the innermost accretion disc coronal
activity. All these mechanisms can now be probed with unprecedented precision
and spatial resolution, thanks to the current and forthcoming generation of
highly sensitive radio arrays.

negative charge, cannot fold into well-defined architectures with tertiary
interactions, in the absence of ions. For ribozymes, divalent cations are known
to be more efficient than monovalent ions in driving them to a compact state
although Mg$^{2+}$ ions are needed for catalytic activities. Therefore, how
ions interact with RNA is relevant in understanding RNA folding. It is often
thought that most of the ions are territorially and non-specifically bound to
the RNA, as predicted by the counterion condensation (CIC) theory. Here, we
show using simulations of ${\it Azoarcus}$ ribozyme, based on an accurate
coarse-grained Three Site Interaction (TIS) model, with explicit divalent and
monovalent cations, that ion condensation is highly specific and depends on the
nucleotide position. The regions with high coordination between the phosphate
groups and the divalent cations are discernible even at very low Mg$^{2+}$
concentrations when the ribozyme does not form tertiary interactions.
Surprisingly, these regions also contain the secondary structural elements that
nucleate subsequently in the self-assembly of RNA, implying that ion
condensation is determined by the architecture of the folded state. These
results are in sharp contrast to interactions of ions (monovalent and divalent)
with rigid charged rods in which ion condensation is uniform and position
independent. The differences are explained in terms of the dramatic
non-monotonic shape fluctuations in the ribozyme as it folds with increasing
Mg$^{2+}$ or Ca$^{2+}$ concentration.

in which on parts of the system it is energetically favourable to project out
doublons from the low energy Hilbert space while on other sites of the system
it is favourable to project out holes while still allowing for doublons. As an
effect the low energy Hilbert space itself varies with sites of the system.
Though the formalism is well developed for the case of doublon projection in
the literature, case of hole projection has not been explored in detail so far.
We derive basic framework by defining creation and annihilation operators for
electrons in a restricted Hilbert space where holes are projected out but which
still allows for doublons. We generalise the idea of Gutzwiller approximation
for case of hole projection which has been done in literature for the case of
doublon projection. To be specific, we provide detailed analysis of strongly
correlated limit of the ionic Hubbard model (IHM) which has a staggered
potential $\Delta$ on two sublattices of a bipartite lattice and the correlated
binary alloys which have binary disorder $\pm V/2$ randomly distributed on
sites of the lattice. In both the cases, for $\Delta \sim U \gg t$ and for
$V\sim U \gg t$, where $U$ is the Hubbard energy cost for having a doublon at a
site, there are sites on which doublons are allowed while holes are the maximum
energy states. We do a systematic generalization of similarity transformation
for both these cases and obtain the effective low energy Hamiltonian. We
further derive Gutzwiller approximation factors which provide renormalization
of various terms in the effective low energy Hamiltonian due to the Gutzwiller
projection operators, excluding holes on some sites and doublons on the
remaining sites.

when part of a dilute suspension is examined numerically for moderate Reynolds
numbers ($10 \le Re \le 80$). Stability metrics for particles with arbitrary
shapes are formulated based on linear-stability theory. Particle shape is
parametrized by a compact, Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)-based
representation. Shape-design is posed as an optimization problem and solved
using adaptive Bayesian optimization. We focus on designing particles for
maximal stability at the channel-centerline robust to perturbations. Our
results indicate that centerline-focusing particles are families of
characteristic ""fish""/""bottle""/""dumbbell""-like shapes, exhibiting fore-aft
asymmetry. A parametric exploration is then performed to identify stable
particle-designs at different k's (particle chord-to-channel width ratio) and
Re's ($0.1 \le k \le 0.4, 10 \le Re \le 80$). Particles at high-k's and Re's
are highly stabilized when compared to those at low-k's and Re's. A comparison
of the modified dumbbell designs from the current framework also shows better
performance to perturbations in Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) when compared
to the rod-disk model reported previously (Uspal & Doyle 2014) for low-Re
Hele-Shaw flow. We identify basins of attraction around the centerline, which
span larger release-angle-ranges and lateral locations (tending to the channel
width) for narrower channels, which effectively standardizes the notion of
global focusing in such configurations using the current stability-paradigm.
The present framework is illustrated for 2D cases and is potentially
generalizable to stability in 3D flow-fields. The current formulation is also
agnostic to Re and particle/channel geometry which indicates substantial

(SM) according to the analyticity property of the Lagrangian as a function of
the Higgs doublet H. Our distinction in analytic and non-analytic corresponds
to the more familiar one between linearly and non-linearly realized electroweak
symmetry, but offers deeper physical insight. From the UV perspective,
non-analyticity occurs when the new states acquire mass from electroweak
symmetry breaking, and thus cannot be decoupled to arbitrarily high scales.
This is reflected in the IR by the anomalous growth of the interaction strength
for processes involving many Higgs bosons and longitudinally polarized massive
vectors, with a breakdown of the EFT description below a scale $O(4 \pi v)$.
Conversely, analyticity occurs when new physics can be pushed parametrically
above the electroweak scale.
  We illustrate the physical distinction between these two EFT families by
discussing Higgs boson self-interactions. In the analytic case, at the price of
some unnaturalness in the Higgs potential, there exists space for $O(1)$
deviations of the cubic coupling, compatible with single Higgs and electroweak
precision measurements, and with new particles out of the direct LHC reach.
Larger deviations are possible, but subject to less robust assumptions about
higher-dimensional operators in the Higgs potential. On the other hand, when
the cubic coupling is produced by a non-analytic deformation of the SM, we show
by an explicit calculation that the theory reaches strong coupling at $O(4 \pi
v)$, quite independently of the magnitude of the cubic enhancement.

method in materials research, able to produce volumetrically large specimens

on heating from high-powered bulb sources in combination with parabolic
mirrors, and hence are constrained to transparent growth chambers with large
solid angles of optical access. This results in a stark limitation on
achievable processing gas pressures, and in turn renders a range of compounds
unsuitable for crystal growth by the floating zone technique, either due to
excessive volatility or due to metastability. Here, we demonstrate a novel
high-pressure laser-based floating zone system (HP-LFZ). The use of lasers for
heating allows implementation of a high-strength metal growth chamber,
permitting greatly enhanced processing pressures over conventional mirror-based
designs, with the current design allowing for pressures up to 1000 bar. We
demonstrate a series of example single crystal growths using this design in
pressures up to 675 bar, a significant increase over processing pressures
attainable in commercially available floating zone systems. The general utility
of the HP-LFZ is also illustrated via growths of a range of complex oxides.

the agent-based modelling paradigm faces mounting criticism, focused
particularly on the rigour of current validation and calibration practices,
most of which remain qualitative and stylised fact-driven. While the literature
on quantitative and data-driven approaches has seen significant expansion in
recent years, most studies have focused on the introduction of new calibration
methods that are neither benchmarked against existing alternatives nor
rigorously tested in terms of the quality of the estimates they produce. We
therefore compare a number of prominent ABM calibration methods, both
established and novel, through a series of computational experiments in an
attempt to determine the respective strengths and weaknesses of each approach

Bayesian estimation, though less popular in the literature, consistently
outperforms frequentist, objective function-based approaches and results in
reasonable parameter estimates in many contexts. Despite this, we also find

only a matter of mathematical curiosity, but also motivated by a quest for 3D
Fibonacci spirals. As we were not able to find any survey on the particular
topic of cubic Fibonacci identities we decided to try to fill this void. We
started by surveying many Fibonacci identities and recording cubic ones.
Obviously, tracing all Fibonacci identities (for identifying a handful) is a
daunting task. Checking several hundred we have realized that it is not always
clear who the author is. The reason is that in many cases an identity was
stated in one article (sometimes without a proof, e.g., as an open problem, or
a conjecture) while later being proven in another article, or effectively
rediscovered independently by other authors. However, we have done our best to
present the identities chronologically. We have supplied our own proof for one
identity, having tried, but failed, to find a published proof. For all the
other identities, we either proved them on a computer, or else verified by hand
their original published proofs. Somehow unexpectedly, our investigations have
revealed only a rather small number of cubic Fibonacci identities, representing
a tiny fraction of all published Fibonacci identities (most of which are linear
or quadratic). Finally, out of these, only a handful of cubic Fibonacci
identities are homogeneous.

in this paper that significant changes in PGM structure do not occur so

statistical study of BOA is thus presented to characterise a pattern of PGM

collapse in a tiny fraction of a second, or expand exponentially forever as
empty, structureless universes. However, restricting to those bubble universes
that form non-linear structure at some time in their history we find
cosmologies that look remarkably similar to ours. They undergo about 60 efolds
of inflation, making them flat, homogeneous and isotropic, and endowing them
with a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primordial density perturbations with
roughly the observed magnitude and tilt. They reheat after inflation to a
period of radiation domination, followed by matter domination with roughly the
observed abundance, followed by vacuum energy domination at roughly the
observed density. None of these features require any model building or small
parameters. Instead, all dimensionful parameters in the theory can be set equal

material. The mass distribution of the system evolves as matter accretes from
the large-scale envelope through the disk and onto the protostar. While this
general picture is supported by simulations and indirect observational
measurements, the specific timescales related to disk growth and envelope
dissipation remain poorly constrained. In this paper we conduct a rigorous test
of a method introduced by J{\o}rgensen et al. (2009) to obtain mass
measurements of disks and envelopes around embedded protostars with
observations that do not resolve the disk (resolution of $\sim$1000\,AU). Using
unresolved data from the recent Mass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their
Evolution with the SMA (MASSES) survey, we derive disk and envelope mass
estimates for $59$ protostellar systems in the Perseus molecular cloud. We
compare our results to independent disk mass measurements from the VLA Nascent
Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) survey and find a strong linear correlation,
suggesting that accurate disk masses can be measured from unresolved
observations. Then, leveraging the size of the MASSES sample, we find no
significant trend in protostellar mass distribution as a function of age, as
approximated from bolometric temperatures. These results may indicate that the
disk mass of a protostar is set near the onset of the Class 0 protostellar
stage and remains roughly constant throughout the Class I protostellar stage.

  Kramers-Wannier duality as an exact $Z_2$ symmetry","42 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases host
non-trivial boundaries that cannot be mimicked in a lower-dimensional system
with a conventional realization of symmetry. However, for SPT phases of bosons
(fermions) within the cohomology (supercohomology) classification the boundary
can be recreated without the bulk at the cost of a non-onsite symmetry action.
This raises the question: can one also mimic the boundaries of SPT phases which
lie outside the (super)cohomology classification? In this paper, we study this
question in the context of 2+1D fermion SPTs. We focus on the root SPT phase
for the symmetry group $G =Z_2 \times Z^f_2$. Starting with an exactly solvable
model for the bulk of this phase constructed by Tarantino and Fidkowski, we
derive an effective 1d lattice model for the boundary. Crucially, the Hilbert
space of this 1d model does not have a local tensor product structure, but
rather is obtained by placing a local constraint on a local tensor product
Hilbert space. We derive the action of the $Z_2$ symmetry on this Hilbert space
and find a simple 3-site Hamiltonian that respects this symmetry. We study this
Hamiltonian numerically using exact diagonalization and DMRG and find strong
evidence that it realizes an Ising CFT where the $Z_2$ symmetry acts as the
Kramers-Wannier duality; this is the expected stable gapless boundary state of
the present SPT. A simple modification of our construction realizes the
boundary of the 2+1D topological superconductor protected by time-reversal
symmetry ${\cal T}$ with ${\cal T}^2 = (-1)^{\cal F}$.

from globular cluster (GC) and stellar kinematics, carries a considerable
amount of uncertainty, with current constraints also allowing for the complete
absence of dark matter. We test the viability of such a scenario by examining
whether in a `baryon-only' mass model, the observed GC population experiences
rapid orbital decay due to dynamical friction. Using a suite of 50 multi-GC
N-body simulations that match observational constraints on both the stellar
component of NGC1052-DF2 and its GC population but differ in the initial
line-of-sight positions and the tangential velocities of the GCs, we show that
there is a substantial amount of realization-to-realization variance in the
evolution of the GCs. Nevertheless, over 10 Gyr, some of the GCs experience
significant orbital evolution. Others evolve less. A combination of reduced
dynamical friction in the galaxy core and GC-GC scattering keeps the GCs
afloat, preventing them from sinking all the way to the galaxy center. While
the current phase-space coordinates of the GCs are not unlikely for a
baryon-only mass model, the GC system does evolve over time. Therefore, if
NGC1052-DF2 has no dark matter, some of its GCs must have formed further out,
and the GC system must have been somewhat more extended in the past. The
presence of a low mass cuspy halo, while allowed by the kinematics, seems
improbable as significantly shorter inspiral timescales in the central region
would quickly lead to the formation of a nuclear star cluster.

globular clusters (GCs), motivating theoretical studies of the formation and
evolution of these sources through stellar evolution coupled to stellar
dynamics. Here we study MSPs in GCs using realistic $N$-body simulations with
our Cluster Monte Carlo code. We show that neutron stars (NSs) formed in
electron-capture supernovae (including both accretion-induced and
merger-induced collapse of white dwarfs) can be spun up through mass transfer
to form MSPs. Both NS formation and spin-up through accretion are greatly
enhanced through dynamical interaction processes. We find that our models for
average GCs at the present day with masses $\approx 2 \times 10^5\,M_\odot$ can
produce up to $10-20$ MSPs, while a very massive GC model with mass $\approx
10^6\,M_\odot$ can produce close to $100$. We show that the number of MSPs is
anti-correlated with the total number of stellar-mass black holes (BHs)
retained in the host cluster. The radial distributions are also affected: MSPs
are more concentrated towards the center in a host cluster with a smaller
number of retained BHs. As a result, the number of MSPs in a GC could be used
to place constraints on its BH population. Some intrinsic properties of MSP
systems in our models (such as the magnetic fields and spin periods) are in
good overall agreement with observations, while others (such as the
distribution of binary companion types) less so, and we discuss the possible
reasons for such discrepancies. Interestingly, our models also demonstrate the
possibility of dynamically forming NS--NS and NS--BH binaries in GCs, although

Universe, including the nature of dark matter or the reason of unexpected
accelerated expansion of the Universe. In order to answer these questions, two
important ingredients are needed: 1) data from observations and 2) a
theoretical model that allows fast comparison between observation and theory.
Most of the cosmological surveys observe galaxies, which are very difficult to
model theoretically due to the complicated physics involved in their formation
and evolution; modeling realistic galaxies over cosmological volumes requires
running computationally expensive hydrodynamic simulations that can cost
millions of CPU hours. In this paper, we propose to use deep learning to
establish a mapping between the 3D galaxy distribution in hydrodynamic
simulations and its underlying dark matter distribution. One of the major
challenges in this pursuit is the very high sparsity in the predicted galaxy
distribution. To this end, we develop a two-phase convolutional neural network
architecture to generate fast galaxy catalogues, and compare our results
against a standard cosmological technique. We find that our proposed approach
either outperforms or is competitive with traditional cosmological techniques.
Compared to the common methods used in cosmology, our approach also provides a
nice trade-off between time-consumption (comparable to fastest benchmark in the
literature) and the quality and accuracy of the predicted simulation. In
combination with current and upcoming data from cosmological observations, our
method has the potential to answer fundamental questions about our Universe

pre-trained dense model. We further investigated the mechanisms underlying the
superior generalization performance of the resultant sparse networks. We found
that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the non-zero parameters

the reconstruction error decays exponentially with respect to the bit-rate. We
build on our previous result, which extends signal decimation to finite frames,

underestimated. In this paper, we characterize high-resolution changes in

spatial statistical methods that allow us to derive gridded estimates that do
not smooth extreme daily measurements and are consistent with statistics from
the original station data while increasing the resulting signal to noise ratio.
Furthermore, we use a robust statistical technique to identify significant
pointwise changes in the climatology of extreme precipitation while carefully
controlling the rate of false positives. We present and discuss seasonal
changes in the statistics of extreme precipitation: the largest and most
spatially-coherent pointwise changes are in fall (SON), with approximately 33%
of CONUS exhibiting significant changes (in an absolute sense). Other seasons
display very few meaningful pointwise changes (in either a relative or absolute
sense), illustrating the difficulty in detecting pointwise changes in extreme
precipitation based on in situ measurements. While our main result involves
seasonal changes, we also present and discuss annual changes in the statistics

texture space or are learned by auto-encoders directly from in-the-wild images.
In all cases, the quality of the facial texture reconstruction of the
state-of-the-art methods is still not capable of modeling textures in high

power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and DCNNs in order to
reconstruct the facial texture and shape from single images. That is, we
utilize GANs to train a very powerful generator of facial texture in UV space.
Then, we revisit the original 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) fitting approaches
making use of non-linear optimization to find the optimal latent parameters
that best reconstruct the test image but under a new perspective. We optimize
the parameters with the supervision of pretrained deep identity features

achieve for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, facial texture

Combine is a key module in the MUF, responsible for merging data, raw or

central tendency. In this work the performance of Combine's MC replicates is
analytically compared against its stated design goals. An alternative
construction is proposed for Combine's MC replicates and its performance is
compared, too, against Combine's design goals. These comparisons are made
within an archetypal two-stage scenario in which received data are first
transformed in conjunction with shared systematic error and then combined to
produce summary information. These comparisons reveal the limited conditions
under which Combine's uncertainty results are unbiased and the extent of these
biases when these conditions are not met. For small MC sample sizes neither
construction, current or alternative, fully meets Combine's design goals, nor
does either construction consistently outperform the other. However, for large
MC sample sizes the bias in the proposed alternative construction is
asymptotically zero, and this construction is recommended.

therefore important to be able to verify their behavior. Because verifying the
correctness of neural networks is extremely challenging, it is common to focus
on the verification of other properties of these systems. One important
property, in particular, is robustness. Most existing definitions of
robustness, however, focus on the worst-case scenario where the inputs are
adversarial. Such notions of robustness are too strong, and unlikely to be
satisfied by-and verifiable for-practical neural networks. Observing that
real-world inputs to neural networks are drawn from non-adversarial probability
distributions, we propose a novel notion of robustness: probabilistic
robustness, which requires the neural network to be robust with at least $(1 -
\epsilon)$ probability with respect to the input distribution. This
probabilistic approach is practical and provides a principled way of estimating
the robustness of a neural network. We also present an algorithm, based on
abstract interpretation and importance sampling, for checking whether a neural
network is probabilistically robust. Our algorithm uses abstract interpretation
to approximate the behavior of a neural network and compute an
overapproximation of the input regions that violate robustness. It then uses
importance sampling to counter the effect of such overapproximation and compute
an accurate estimate of the probability that the neural network violates the
robustness property.

approximately twice at 2.4 GHz as compared to 915 MHz. Moreover, the variance
of shadowing increases significantly as the in vivo antenna is placed deeper

unprecedentedly high rates in ambient conditions. This enhancement of quantum
emitters' radiation rate is based on the existence of optical modes with highly
sub-diffraction volumes supported by plasmonic gap nanoantennas. Nanoantennas
with gap sizes on the order of few nanometers have been typically produced
using various self-assembly or random assembly techniques. Yet, the difficulty
of controllably fabricate nanoantennas with the smallest mode sizes coupled to
pre-characterized single emitters until now has remained a serious issue
plaguing the development of quantum plasmonic devices. We demonstrate the
transfer of nanodiamonds with single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to an
epitaxial silver substrate and their subsequent deterministic coupling to
plasmonic gap nanoantennas. Through fine control of the assembled nanoantenna
geometry, a dramatic shortening of the NV fluorescence lifetime was achieved.
We furthermore show that by preselecting NV centers exhibiting a photostable
spin contrast, a coherent spin dynamics can be measured in the coupled
configuration. The demonstrated approach opens unique applications of
plasmon-enhanced quantum emitters for integrated quantum information and
sensing devices.

photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a ubiquitous tool for the study of
solids. When extended to the temporal domain, time-resolved (TR)-ARPES offers
the potential to move beyond equilibrium properties, exploring both the
unoccupied electronic structure as well as its dynamical response under
ultrafast perturbation. Historically, ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (XUV)
sources employing high-order harmonic generation (HHG) have required
compromises that make it challenging to achieve a high energy resolution -
which is highly desirable for many TR-ARPES studies - while producing high
photon energies and a high photon flux. We address this challenge by performing
HHG inside a femtosecond enhancement cavity (fsEC), realizing a practical
source for TR-ARPES that achieves a flux of over 10$^{11}$ photons/s delivered
to the sample, operates over a range of 8-40 eV with a repetition rate of 60
MHz. This source enables TR-ARPES studies with a temporal and energy resolution
of 190 fs and 22 meV, respectively. To characterize the system, we perform
ARPES measurements of polycrystalline Au and MoTe$_2$, as well as TR-ARPES
studies on graphite.

enhanced Rashba spin-orbit coupling provide a new platform for investigation of
spintronic and magnetic phenomena in materials. We theoretically investigate
the interlayer exchange interaction between two ferromagnets deposited on
opposite surfaces of a bulk Rashba semiconductor BiTeI in its trivial and
topological insulator phases. In the trivial phase BiTeI, we find that for
ferromagnets with a magnetization orthogonal to the interface, the exchange
coupling is reminiscent of that of a conventional three-dimensional metal.
Remarkably, ferromagnets with a magnetization parallel to the interface display
a magnetic exchange qualitatively different from that of conventional
three-dimensional metal due to the spin-orbit coupling. In this case, the
interlayer exchange interaction acquires two periods of oscillations and decays
as the inverse of the thickness of the BiTeI layer. For topological BiTeI, the
magnetic exchange interaction becomes mediated only by the helical surface
states and acts between the one-dimensional spin chains at the edges of the
sample. The surface state-mediated interlayer exchange interaction allows for
the coupling of ferromagnets with non-collinear magnetization and displays a
decay power different from that of trivial BiTeI, allowing the detection of the
topological phase transition in this material. Our work provides insights into
the magnetic properties of these newly discovered materials and their possible
functionalization.

hardware implementation. In this work, a hardware architecture of the
Linearized Bregman Iterations algorithm is presented and tested on a Field

FPGAs and the percentage of used hardware as well as the maximum frequency

This represents a tremendous advantage in using a dedicated unit for trend

reported, based on measurements with the SOPHIE spectrograph. Current data do
not allow us to distinguish between a 12.95-day period and its one-day alias at
1.08 days, but favour the former slightly. The velocity variation has an
amplitude of 1.6 m/s, making this the lowest-amplitude signal detected with
SOPHIE up to now. We have performed a detailed analysis of the significance of
the signal and its origin, including extensive simulations with both
uncorrelated and correlated noise, representing the signal induced by stellar
activity. The signal is significantly detected, and the results from all tests
point to its planetary origin. Additionally, the presence of an additional
acceleration in the velocity time series is suggested by the current data. On
the other hand, a previously reported signal with a period of 9.9 days,
detected in HIRES velocities of this star, is not recovered in the SOPHIE data.
An independent analysis of the HIRES dataset also fails to unveil the 9.9-day
signal.
  If the 12.95-day period is the real one, the amplitude of the signal detected
with SOPHIE implies the presence of a planet, called Gl411 b, with a minimum
mass of around three Earth masses, orbiting its star at a distance of 0.079 AU.
The planet receives about 3.5 times the insolation received by Earth, which
implies an equilibrium temperature between 255 K and 350 K, and makes it too
hot to be in the habitable zone. At a distance of only 2.5 pc, Gl411 b, is the
third closest low-mass planet detected to date. Its proximity to Earth will
permit probing its atmosphere with a combination of high-contrast imaging and
high-dispersion spectroscopy in the next decade.

address diverse requirements. This paper presents the significance of adaptive
guards considering a windowed-OFDM system which supports a variety of services
operating asynchronously under the same network. The windowing approach
requires a guard duration to suppress the out-of-band emissions (OOBE), and the
guard band is required to handle the adjacent channel interference (ACI) along
with the windowing. The guards in both time and frequency domains are optimized
with respect to the use case and power offset between the users. To fully
exploit and further increase the potential of adaptive guards, an
interference-based scheduling algorithm is proposed as well. The results show
that the precise design that facilitates such flexibility reduce the guards
significantly and boost the spectral efficiency.

is a nonlinear function of an expected value, i.e., compositional stochastic
{strongly convex programs}. We consider the case where the decision variable is
not vector-valued but instead belongs to a reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
(RKHS), motivated by risk-aware formulations of supervised learning and Markov
Decision Processes defined over continuous spaces.
  We develop the first memory-efficient stochastic algorithm for this setting,
which we call Compositional Online Learning with Kernels (COLK). COLK, at its
core a two-time-scale stochastic approximation method, addresses the fact that
(i) compositions of expected value problems cannot be addressed by classical
stochastic gradient due to the presence of the inner expectation; and (ii) the
RKHS-induced parameterization has complexity which is proportional to the
iteration index which is mitigated through greedily constructed subspace
projections. We establish almost sure convergence of COLK with attenuating
step-sizes, and linear convergence in mean to a neighborhood with constant
step-sizes, as well as the fact that its complexity is at-worst finite. The
experiments with robust formulations of supervised learning demonstrate that
COLK reliably converges, attains consistent performance across training runs,
and thus overcomes overfitting.

computing networks, where a source node transmits a computation-intensive task
to a destination via the aid of multiple relay nodes. It differs from the
traditional relay nodes in the way that each relay node is equipped with an
edge computing server, thus each relay node can execute the received task and
forwards the computed result to the destination. Accordingly, we define a delay
outage probability to evaluate the impact of the relay computing ability on the
link communications, and then propose a latency-best relay selection (LBRS)
scheme that not only consider the communication capability, but also consider
the computing ability. The performance of the proposed relay selection scheme
with the traditional communication-only relay selection (CORS) and
computing-only selection (CPORS) schemes in terms of the delay outage
probability and the diversity order is analyzed, compared with other relay
selection schemes. We show that the proposed LBRS scheme reduces to the
traditional CORS scheme under the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. We
further reveal that the diversity orders of both the proposed LBRS and CORS
schemes are dependent on the computing ability of relay nodes.

stronger and more general approximation guarantees. First of all, we show that
the number of hidden units only needs to be larger than a quantity dependent on

tool for computing the electronic structure of molecular and periodic systems,
especially when electrons of the system are strongly correlated. However, for
the GFCC to be routinely used in the electronic structure calculations, robust
numerical techniques and approximations must be employed to reduce its high
computational overhead. In our recent studies, we demonstrated that the GFCC
equations can be solved directly in the frequency domain using iterative linear
solvers, which can be easily distributed in a massively parallel environment.
In the present work, we demonstrate a successful application of
model-order-reduction (MOR) techniques in the GFCC framework. Briefly, for a
frequency regime which requires high resolution spectral function, instead of
solving GFCC linear equation of full dimension for every single frequency
point, an efficiently-solvable linear system model of a reduced dimension may
be built upon projecting the original GFCC linear system onto a subspace. From
this reduced order model is obtained a reasonable approximation to the full
dimensional GFCC linear equations in both interpolative and extrapolative
spectral regions. Here, we show that the subspace can be properly constructed
in an iterative manner from the auxiliary vectors of the GFCC linear equations
at some selected frequencies within the spectral region of interest. During the
iterations, the quality of the subspace and the linear system model can be
systematically improved. The method is tested in terms of the efficiency and
accuracy of computing spectral functions for some typical molecular systems
such as carbon monoxide, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and adenine. As a byproduct,
the obtained reduced order model may provide a high quality initial guess which
improves the convergence rate for the existing iterative linear solver.

the physical oddity of the proposed moon, that is, its giant radius prompt us
to re-examine the data and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) used for
detection. We combine the Kepler data with the previously published Hubble
light curve. In an alternative approach, we perform a synchronous polynomial
detrending and fitting of the Kepler data combined with our own extraction of
the Hubble photometry. We generate five million MCMC realizations of the data
with both a planet-only model and a planet-moon model and compute the BIC
difference (DeltaBIC) between the most likely models, respectively. DeltaBIC
values of -44.5 (using previously published Hubble data) and -31.0 (using our
own detrending) yield strongly support the exomoon interpretation. Most of our
orbital realizations, however, are very different from the best-fit solutions,
suggesting that the likelihood function that best describes the data is
non-Gaussian. We measure a 73.7min early arrival of Kepler-1625b for its Hubble
transit at the 3 sigma level, possibly caused by a 1 day data gap near the
first Kepler transit, stellar activity, or unknown systematics. The radial
velocity amplitude of a possible unseen hot Jupiter causing Kepler-1625b's
transit timing variation could be some 100m/s. Although we find a similar
solution to the planet-moon model as previously proposed, careful consideration
of its statistical evidence leads us to believe that this is not a secure
exomoon detection. Unknown systematic errors in the Kepler/Hubble data make the
DeltaBIC an unreliable metric for an exomoon search around Kepler-1625b,
allowing for alternative interpretations of the signal.

ordering $(P, <)$ of size $\kappa^+$, for any $\kappa$ of uncountable

consistent with ZFC that the dimension of the Turing degrees under partial
ordering can be strictly less than the continuum.

enabling opportunistic access in TV white space (TVWS) using cognitive radio
(CR) technology. When heterogeneous CR networks that are based on different
wireless standards operate in the same TVWS, coexistence issues can potentially
cause major problems. Enabling collaborative coexistence via direct
coordination between heterogeneous CR networks is very challenging, due to
incompatible MAC/PHY designs of coexisting networks, requirement of an
over-the-air common control channel for inter-network communications, and time
synchronization across devices from different networks. Moreover, such a
coexistence scheme would require competing networks or service providers to
exchange sensitive control information that may raise conflict of interest
issues and customer privacy concerns. In this paper, we present an architecture
for enabling collaborative coexistence of heterogeneous CR networks over TVWS,
called Symbiotic Heterogeneous coexistence ARchitecturE (SHARE). Define
""indirect coordination"" first before using it. Because coexistence cannot avoid
coordination By mimicking the symbiotic relationships between heterogeneous
organisms in a stable ecosystem, SHARE establishes an indirect coordination
mechanism between heterogeneous CR networks via a mediator system, which avoids
the drawbacks of direct coordination. SHARE includes two spectrum sharing
algorithms whose designs were inspired by well-known models and theories from
theoretical ecology, viz, the interspecific competition model and the ideal
free distribution model.

velocity increasing linearly from the axis to the edge. This pattern can be
formed by a spherically expanding wind with axial density concentration. In
this picture, the diverging velocity profile naturally possesses an increasing
expansion velocity away from the axis, resulting in a tooth-like feature on the

which leads to inefficient pruning and prohibits them from solving large scale

for Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) require only a linear
number of messages, but they cannot be directly applied into ADCOPs due to a

combining inference and search to effectively solve ADCOPs at an acceptable
loss of privacy. Specifically, we propose a hybrid complete algorithm called
PT-ISABB which uses a tailored inference algorithm to provide tight lower

improvements for object detection. However, detecting tiny objects in
large-scale remote sensing images still remains challenging. First, the extreme
large input size makes the existing object detection solutions too slow for
practical use. Second, the massive and complex backgrounds cause serious false
alarms. Moreover, the ultratiny objects increase the difficulty of accurate
detection. To tackle these problems, we propose a unified and self-reinforced
network called remote sensing region-based convolutional neural network
($\mathcal{R}^2$-CNN), composing of backbone Tiny-Net, intermediate global
attention block, and final classifier and detector. Tiny-Net is a lightweight
residual structure, which enables fast and powerful features extraction from
inputs. Global attention block is built upon Tiny-Net to inhibit false
positives. Classifier is then used to predict the existence of targets in each
patch, and detector is followed to locate them accurately if available. The
classifier and detector are mutually reinforced with end-to-end training, which
further speed up the process and avoid false alarms. Effectiveness of
$\mathcal{R}^2$-CNN is validated on hundreds of GF-1 images and GF-2 images
that are 18 000 $\times$ 18 192 pixels, 2.0-m resolution, and 27 620 $\times$
29 200 pixels, 0.8-m resolution, respectively. Specifically, we can process a
GF-1 image in 29.4 s on Titian X just with single thread. According to our
knowledge, no previous solution can detect the tiny object on such huge remote
sensing images gracefully. We believe that it is a significant step toward
practical real-time remote sensing systems.

examples (AdExs) can cause drastic, targeted misclassification results mostly
in spectrum sensing/ survey applications (e.g. BPSK mistaken for 8-PSK) with
minimal waveform perturbation. It is not clear if the RF AdExs maintain their
effects in the physical world, i.e., when AdExs are delivered over-the-air
(OTA). Our research on deep learning AdExs and proposed defense mechanisms are
RF-centric, and incorporate physical world, OTA effects. We here present
defense mechanisms based on statistical tests. One test to detect AdExs
utilizes Peak-to- Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) of the DL data points delivered
OTA, while another statistical test uses the Softmax outputs of the DL
classifier, which corresponds to the probabilities the classifier assigns to
each of the trained classes. The former test leverages the RF nature of the

collected from various sectors. The system qualities were examined by analysis
of sensitivity and influence. The result shows that the general resilience of
Beijing's road system exhibits a ""V"" shape in its trend, with the probability
of being generally resilient between 50% and 70%, and at its minimum in 2006.
There was a steep increase in such a probability since 2006. In addition, the
general resilience of Beijing's road transportation system is most affected by
its capabilities: (1) to rebuild its performance, (2) to be robust, (3) to
adapt, (4) to change, and (5) to quickly repair damaged parts. The proposed BNM
is a promising tool for multi-dimensional and systematic analysis, instead of
finding a one-size-fits-all quantification criterion for resilience.

proposed for metal-2D multilayered semiconductor junctions (MmSJ). Taking
multilayered MoS2 as a typical example for van der Waals (vdW) semiconductor in
MmSJ, the extended FLP theory has the following character: strong pinning right
at the metal-1st-layer semiconductor interface while depinning occurs between
MoS2 layers. This depinning effect between vdW layers has several important
consequences: 1) the overall pinning in MmSJ is greatly weakened; 2) p-type
contact, rarely obtained in metal-monolayer MoS2 junctions, becomes favored in
MmSJ, which is important for CMOS logical devices; 3) depinning between MoS2
layers result in type II band alignment in MoS2 'homojunction' supported on
metals, which is useful for optoelectronics. Moreover, our extended FLP theory
sheds light on the recent controversial experimental observation and paves a
new and universal route to type II band alignment in vdW 'homojunctions'.

enormous sideband suppression ratio in the ASG enables an ultra-large dynamic

expressing and enforcing protocols of interaction, (ii) controlling resource

This article presents the design and type-theoretic foundation of Nomos, a
programming language for digital contracts that addresses these challenges. To
express and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on shared binary session types.
To control resource usage, Nomos employs automatic amortized resource analysis.
To prevent the duplication or deletion of assets, Nomos uses a linear type
system. A monad integrates the effectful session-typed language with a
general-purpose functional language. Nomos' prototype implementation features
linear-time type checking and efficient type reconstruction that includes
automatic inference of resource bounds via off-the-shelf linear optimization.
The effectiveness of the language is evaluated with case studies about
implementing common smart contracts such as auctions, elections, and
currencies. Nomos is completely formalized, including the type system, a cost
semantics, and a transactional semantics to instantiate Nomos contracts on a
blockchain. The type soundness proof ensures that protocols are followed at
run-time and that types establish sound upper bounds on the resource
consumption, ruling out re-entrancy and out-of-gas vulnerabilities.

in many disciplines. While network expansion has been studied thoroughly, less
is known about how empirical networks behave when shrinking. For transportation
networks, this is especially relevant on account of their connection with the
socio-economical substrate, and we focus here on the evolution of the French
railway network from its birth in 1840 to 2000, in relation to the country's
demographic dynamics. The network evolved in parallel with technology (e.g.,
faster trains) and under strong constraints, such as preserving a good
population coverage and balancing cost and efficiency. We show that the
shrinking phase that started in 1930 decreased the total length of the network
while preserving efficiency and population coverage: efficiency and robustness
remain remarkably constant while the total length of the network shrinks by
$50\%$ between 1930 and 2000, and the total travel time and time-diameter
decreased by more than $75\%$ during the same period. Moreover, shrinking the
network did not affect the overall accessibility, with an average travel time
that decreases steadily since its formation. This evolution leads naturally to
an increase of transportation multimodality (such as a massive use of cars) and
shows the importance of considering together transportation modes acting at
different spatial scales. More generally, our results suggest that shrinking is
not necessarily associated with a decay in performance and functions, but can
be beneficial in terms of design goals and can be part of the natural evolution
of an adaptive network.

the SNR HB 21. The bulk of this gamma-ray emission is detected from the
remnant; photons up to $\sim$10\,GeV show clear evidence of curvature at the
lower energies. The remnant is characterized by an extension of $0^{\circ}.83$,
that is, 30\% smaller than claimed in previous studies. The increased
statistics allows us also to resolve a point-like source at the edge of the
remnant, in proximity to a molecular cloud of the Cyg OB7 complex. In the
southern part of the remnant, a hint of an additional gamma-ray excess in
correspondence to shocked molecular clouds is observed. The spectral energy
distribution of the SNR shows evidence of a break around 400 MeV, which can be
properly fitted within both the hadronic and leptonic scenario. The pion-decay
mechanism reproduces well the gamma rays, postulating a proton spectrum with a
slope $\sim 2.5$ and with a steepening around tens of GeV, which could be
explained by the energy-dependent escape of particles from the remnant. In the
leptonic scenario the electron spectrum within the SNR matches closely the
locally measured spectrum. This remarkable and novel result shows that SNR HB
21 could be a direct contributor to the population of Galactic electrons. In
the leptonic scenario, we find that the local electron spectrum with a break
around 2 GeV, closely evokes the best-fitting parental spectrum within this
SNR. If such a scenario is confirmed, this would indicate that the SNR might be
a source of Galactic background electrons.

non-perturbative method based on Unitary Chiral Perturbation Theory was also
developed for performing those resummations. This power counting and
non-perturbative techniques were firstly applied to calculate the pion

cancellation of the contributions at NLO to the pion self-energy and decay

We
investigate the statistical properties of 1-min user activity time series of

number of online users exhibits clear intraday and weekly patterns due to
human's circadian rhythms and week cycles. Statistical analysis shows that the
distribution of absolute activity fluctuations has a power-law tail for 44
virtual worlds with an average tail exponent close to 2.15. The partition
function approach unveils that the absolute activity fluctuations possess
multifractal features for all the 95 virtual worlds. For the sample of 44
virtual worlds with power-law tailed distributions of the absolute activity
fluctuations, the width of singularity $\Delta\alpha$ is negatively correlated
with the maximum activity ($p$-value=0.070) and the time to the maximum
activity ($p$-value=0.010). The negative correlations are not observed for
neither the other 51 virtual worlds nor the whole sample of the 95 virtual
worlds. In addition, numerical experiments indicate that both temporal
structure and large fluctuations have influence on the multifractal spectrum.
We also find that the temporal structure has stronger impact on the singularity
width than large fluctuations.

First, we establish weighted versions of classical re-expansion results in the

re-expansion problem to general compact Lie groups can be formulated as
follows: given a function on the maximal torus of a compact Lie group, what
conditions on its (toroidal) Fourier coefficients are sufficient in order to
have that the group Fourier coefficients of its central extension are summable.
We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the above property to
hold in terms of the root system of the group. Consequently, we show how this
problem leads to the re-expansions of even/odd functions on compact Lie groups,
giving a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the discrete Hilbert
transform and the root system. In the model case of the group SU(2) a simple
sufficient condition is given.

Further investigation shows that a small proportion of the possible models give

require so far again a dense pixel representation. To avoid this, we introduce
local Fourier slice photography that allows for refocused image reconstruction
directly from a sparse wavelet representation of a light field, either to
obtain an image or a compressed representation of it. The result is made
possible by wavelets that respect the ""slicing's"" intrinsic structure and
enable us to derive exact reconstruction filters for the refocused image in
closed form. Image reconstruction then amounts to applying these filters to the
light field's wavelet coefficients, and hence no reconstruction of a dense
pixel representation is required. We demonstrate that this substantially
reduces storage requirements and also computation times. We furthermore analyze
the computational complexity of our algorithm and show that it scales linearly
with the size of the reconstructed region and the non-negligible wavelet
coefficients, i.e. with the visual complexity.

a good position to offer a rich experimental research program in the field of

neutrino beam from Protvino towards the KM3NeT/ORCA detector, which is
currently under construction in the Mediterranean Sea 40 km offshore Toulon,
France. This proposal is known as P2O. Thanks to its baseline of 2595 km, this
experiment would yield an unparalleled sensitivity to matter effects in the
Earth, allowing for the determination of the neutrino mass ordering with a high
level of certainty after only a few years of running at a modest beam intensity
of $\approx$ 90 kW. With a prolonged exposure ($\approx$ 1500 kW*yr), a
2$\sigma$ sensitivity to the leptonic CP-violating Dirac phase can be achieved.
A second stage of the experiment, comprising a further intensity upgrade of the
accelerator complex and a densified version of the ORCA detector (Super-ORCA),
would allow for up to a 6$\sigma$ sensitivity to CP violation and a
10$^\circ$-17$^\circ$ resolution on the CP phase after 10 years of running with
a 450 kW beam, competitive with other planned experiments. The initial
composition and energy spectrum of the neutrino beam would need to be monitored
by a near detector, to be constructed several hundred meters downstream from
the proton beam target. The same neutrino beam and near detector set-up would
also allow for neutrino-nucleus cross section measurements to be performed. A
short-baseline sterile neutrino search experiment would also be possible.

multiforme (GBM) after receiving the standard treatment. In the course of
post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PsP exhibits similarities in
shape and intensity to the true tumor progression (TTP) of GBM. So, these
similarities pose challenges on the differentiation of these types of
progression and hence the selection of the appropriate clinical treatment
strategy. In this paper, we introduce DC-AL GAN, a novel feature learning
method based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and
AlexNet, to discriminate between PsP and TTP in MRI images. Due to the
adversarial relationship between the generator and the discriminator of DCGAN,
high-level discriminative features of PsP and TTP can be derived for the
discriminator with AlexNet. Also, a feature fusion scheme is used to combine
higher-layer features with lower-layer information, leading to more powerful
features that are used for effectively discriminating between PsP and TTP. The
experimental results show that DC-AL GAN achieves desirable PsP and TTP
classification performance that is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.

XXI 1354 \AA\ line to fundamental, standing, linear fast sausage modes (FSMs)
in flare loops. Starting with the fluid parameters for an FSM in a straight
tube with equilibrium parameters largely compatible with the IRIS measurements,
we synthesize the line profiles by incorporating the non-Equilibrium Ionization
(NEI) effect in the computation of the contribution function. We find that both
the intensity and Doppler shift oscillate at the wave period ($P$). The phase
difference between the two differs from the expected value ($90^\circ$) only
slightly because NEI plays only a marginal role in determining the ionic
fraction of Fe XXI in the examined dense loop. The Doppler width modulations,
however, posses an asymmetry in the first and second halves of a wave period,
leading to a secondary periodicity at $P/2$ in addition to the primary one at
$P$. This behavior results from the competition between the broadening due to
bulk flow and that due to temperature variations, with the latter being
stronger but not overwhelmingly so. These expected signatures, with the
exception of the Doppler width, are largely consistent with the IRIS
measurements, thereby corroborating the reported detection of a fundamental
FSM. The forward modeled signatures are useful for identifying fundamental FSMs
in flare loops from measurements of the Fe \MyRoman{21} 1354 \AA\ line with
instruments similar to IRIS, even though a much higher cadence is required for
the expected behavior in the Doppler widths to be detected.

invariant gravity, where the interior consists of a gauged scalar field. We
find exact solutions of the exterior of a stationary spinning cosmic string,
where we write the metric as $ g_{\mu\nu}=\omega^2\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$, with
$\omega$ a dilaton field which contains all the scale dependences. The
""unphysical"" metric $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$ is related to the $(2+1)$-dimensional
Kerr spacetime. The equation for the angular momentum $J$ decouples, for the
vacuum situation as well as for global strings, from the other field equations
and delivers a kind of spin-mass relation. For the most realistic solution, $J$
falls off as $\sim\frac{1}{r}$ and $\partial_r J \rightarrow 0$ close to the
core. The spacetime is Ricci flat. The formation of closed timelike curves can
be pushed to space infinity for suitable values of the parameters and the
violation of the weak energy condition can be avoided. For the interior, a
numerical solution is found. This solution can easily be matched at the
boundary on the exterior exact solution by special choice of the parameters of
the string. It turns out, as expected from the ""holographic"" principle, that
the exact solution of the exterior is equivalent with the warped
five-dimensional brane world model, with only a cosmological constant in the
bulk. This example shows the power of conformal invariance to bridge the gap
between general relativity and quantum field theory.

agent and the treasure are modeled as points. This is a variant of the task
known as treasure hunt. The treasure is at a distance at most $D$ from the
initial position of the agent, and the agent finds the treasure when it gets at
distance $r$ from it, called the {\em vision radius}. However, the agent does
not know the location of the treasure and does not know the parameters $D$ and
$r$. The cost of finding the treasure is the length of the trajectory of the
agent. We investigate the tradeoffs between the amount of information held {\em
a priori} by the agent and the cost of treasure hunt. Following the
well-established paradigm of {\em algorithms with advice}, this information is
given to the agent in advance as a binary string, by an oracle cooperating with
the agent and knowing the location of the treasure and the initial position of
the agent. The size of advice given to the agent is the length of this binary
string.
  For any size $z$ of advice and any $D$ and $r$, let $OPT(z,D,r)$ be the
optimal cost of finding the treasure for parameters $z$, $D$ and $r$, if the
agent has only an advice string of length $z$ as input. We design treasure hunt
algorithms working with advice of size $z$ at cost $O(OPT(z,D,r))$ whenever
$r\leq 1$ or $r\geq 0.9D$. For intermediate values of $r$, i.e., $1<r<0.9D$, we
design an almost optimal scheme of algorithms: for any constant $\alpha>0$, the
treasure can be found at cost $O(OPT(z,D,r)^{1+\alpha})$.

Differentiability has been shown in the literature to be a key feature in the

mapped to a quantum entangled state where some properties on one side can be
used to find new properties on the other side. However, the consequences of the
existence of a classical (critical) phase transition on the corresponding
quantum state has been mostly ignored. This is particularly interesting since
the classical partition function exhibits non-analytic behavior at the critical
point and such behavior could have important consequences on the quantum side.
In this paper, we consider this problem for an important example of Kitaev
toric code model which has been shown to correspond to the two-dimensional (2D)
Ising model though a duality transformation. Through such duality
transformation, it is shown that the temperature on the classical side is
mapped to bit-flip noise on the quantum side. It is then shown that a
transition from a coherent superposition of a given quantum state to a
non-coherent mixture corresponds exactly to paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase
transition in the Ising model. To identify such a transition further, we define
an order parameter to characterize the decoherency of such a mixture and show
that it behaves similar to the order parameter (magnetization) of 2D Ising
model, a behavior that is interpreted as a robust coherency in the toric code
model. Furthermore, we consider other properties of the noisy toric code model
exactly at the critical point. We show that there is a relative stability to
noise for the toric code state at the critical noise which is revealed by a
relative reduction in susceptibility to noise. We close the paper with a
discussion on connection between the robust coherency as well as the critical
stability with topological order of the toric code model.

on a set of combinatorial objects by elementary, local changes. Skeletons of
associahedra, for instance, are the graphs induced by quadrilateral flips in
triangulations of a convex polygon. For some definition of a flip graph, a
natural computational problem to consider is the flip distance: Given two
objects, what is the minimum number of flips needed to transform one into the
other?
  We consider flip graphs on orientations of simple graphs, where flips consist
of reversing the direction of some edges. More precisely, we consider so-called
$\alpha$-orientations of a graph $G$, in which every vertex $v$ has a specified
outdegree $\alpha(v)$, and a flip consists of reversing all edges of a directed
cycle. We prove that deciding whether the flip distance between two
$\alpha$-orientations of a planar graph $G$ is at most two is \NP-complete.
This also holds in the special case of perfect matchings, where flips involve
alternating cycles. This problem amounts to finding geodesics on the common
base polytope of two partition matroids, or, alternatively, on an alcoved
polytope. It therefore provides an interesting example of a flip distance
question that is computationally intractable despite having a natural
interpretation as a geodesic on a nicely structured combinatorial polytope.
  We also consider the dual question of the flip distance betwe en graph
orientations in which every cycle has a specified number of forward edges, and
a flip is the reversal of all edges in a minimal directed cut. In general, the
problem remains hard. However, if we restrict to flips that only change sinks
into sources, or vice-versa, then the problem can be solved in polynomial time.
Here we exploit the fact that the flip graph is the cover graph of a
distributive lattice. This generalizes a recent result from Zhang, Qian, and
Zhang.

proportional to the amount of time needed to obtain static analysis results in

that summarizes fix patterns into a hierarchy ranging from general to specific
patterns. Instead of a computationally expensive exploration of a potentially
large space of candidate fixes, Getafix uses a simple yet effective ranking
technique that uses the context of a code change to select the most appropriate
fix for a given bug. Our evaluation applies Getafix to 1,268 bug fixes for six
bug categories reported by popular static analyzers for Java, including null
dereferences, incorrect API calls, and misuses of particular language
constructs. The approach predicts exactly the human-written fix as the top-most

top-5 suggestions contain fixes for 526 of the 1,268 bugs. Moreover, we report

magneto-optical efficiency of iron garnet materials for the miniaturization of
nonreciprocal devices such as isolators and circulators. Elemental
substitutions or proper nano-structuring to benefit from optical resonances
have been pursued. However, all these approaches still require film thicknesses
of at least several tens of microns to deliver useful device applications, and
suffer from narrow bandwidths in the case of optical resonance effects. This
Letter reports on a newly discovered enhancement of the Faraday Effect observed
experimentally in nanoscale bismuth-substituted iron garnet films. It is shown
here that this enhancement is not due to elemental substitution or
compositional variations. Nor is it due to photon trapping or resonance
effects. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of the Faraday
rotation reveals a dramatic seven-fold amplification in the magneto-optic
gyrotropy within only 2 nm of the air-surface interface, corresponding to just
a couple of atomic monolayers as a result of symmetry-breaking at the air-film
interface. This finding opens up an avenue to the application of monolayer
magnetic garnets for the control of light.

example we consider a self-attractive Bose-Einstein condensate with random
spin-orbit coupling (SOC). If Zeeman splitting is also included, the system
becomes nonintegrable. We illustrate this by considering the random walk of a
soliton in a disordered SOC landscape. While at zero Zeeman splitting the
soliton moves without scattering along linear trajectories in the random SOC
landscape, at nonzero splitting it exhibits strong scattering by the SOC
inhomogeneities. For a large Zeeman splitting the integrability is recovered.
In this sense the Zeeman splitting serves as a parameter controlling the
crossover between two different integrable limits.

quantum fields. By probability we mean that there is an unknown operator,
physical or nonphysical, whose eigenvalues obey a certain statistical
distribution. Eigenvalue spectra define spectral functions. Various
thermodynamic quantities in thermodynamics and effective actions in quantum
field theory are all spectral functions. In the scheme, eigenvalues obey a
probability distribution, so a probability distribution determines a family of
spectral functions in thermodynamics and in quantum field theory. This leads to
probability thermodynamics and probability quantum fields determined by a
probability distribution. There are two types of spectra: lower bounded
spectra, corresponding to the probability distribution with nonnegative random
variables, and the lower unbounded spectra, corresponding to probability
distributions with negative random variables. For lower unbounded spectra, we
use the generalized definition of spectral functions. In some cases, we
encounter divergences. We remove the divergence by a renormalization procedure.
Moreover, in virtue of spectral theory in physics, we generalize some concepts
in probability theory. For example, the moment generating function in
probability theory does not always exist. We redefine the moment generating
function as the generalized heat kernel, which makes the concept definable when
the definition in probability theory fails. As examples, we construct examples
corresponding to some probability distributions. Thermodynamic quantities,
vacuum amplitudes, one-loop effective actions, and vacuum energies for various
probability distributions are presented.

display significant Zeeman signatures that we have modelled using Zeeman
Doppler Imaging (ZDI). The magnetic field of TWA 6 is split equally between
poloidal and toroidal components, with the largest fraction of energy in
higher-order modes, with a total unsigned flux of 840 G, and a poloidal
component tilted $35^{\circ}$ from the rotation axis. TWA 8A has a 70 per cent
poloidal field, with most of the energy in higher-order modes, with an unsigned
flux of 1.4 kG (with a magnetic filling factor of 0.2), and a poloidal field
tilted $20^{\circ}$ from the rotation axis. Spectral fitting of the very strong
field in \tb (in individual lines, simultaneously for Stokes $I$ and $V$)
yielded a mean magnetic field strength of $6.0\pm0.5$ kG. The higher field
strengths recovered from spectral fitting suggests that a significant
proportion of magnetic energy lies in small-scale fields that are unresolved by
ZDI. So far, wTTSs in MaTYSSE appear to show that the poloidal-field
axisymmetry correlates with the magnetic field strength. Moreover, it appears
that classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs) and wTTSs are mostly poloidal and
axisymmetric when mostly convective and cooler than $\sim4300$ K, with hotter

longitudinal polarization of gauge bosons can be naturally identified as
mixture of the goldstone component and a remnant gauge component that vanishes
at the limit of zero mass, making the goldstone equivalence manifest. In light
of this observation, we re-examine the Feynman rules of massive gauge theory by
treating gauge fields and their corresponding goldstone fields as single
objects, writing them uniformly as 5-component ""vector"" fields. The gauge group
is taken to be $SU(2)_L$ to preserve custodial symmetry. We find the derivation
of gauge-goldstone propagators becomes rather trivial by noticing there is a
remarkable parallel between massless gauge theory and massive gauge theory in
this notation. We also derive the Feynman rules of all vertices, finding the
vertex for self-interactions of vector (gauge-goldstone) bosons are especially
simplified. We then demonstrate that the new form of the longitudinal
polarization vector and the standard form give the same results for all the
3-point on-shell amplitudes. This on-shell matching confirms similar results
obtained with on-shell approach for massive scattering amplitudes by
Arkani-Hamed et.al. Finally we calculate some $1\rightarrow 2$ collinear
splitting amplitudes by making use of the new Feynman rules and the on-shell
match condition.

time to hospital readmission are subject to truncation by death. These settings
are often modeled with illness-death models for the hazards of the terminal and
nonterminal events, but evaluating causal treatment effects with hazard models
is problematic due to conditioning on survival (a post-treatment outcome) that
is embedded in the definition of a hazard. Extending an existing survivor
average causal effect (SACE) estimand, we frame the evaluation of treatment
effects in the context of semicompeting risks with principal stratification and
introduce two new causal estimands: the time-varying survivor average causal
effect (TV-SACE) and the restricted mean survivor average causal effect
(RM-SACE). These principal causal effects are defined among units that would
survive regardless of assigned treatment. We adopt a Bayesian estimation
procedure that parameterizes illness-death models for both treatment arms. We
outline a frailty specification that can accommodate within-person correlation
between nonterminal and terminal event times, and we discuss potential avenues
for adding model flexibility. The method is demonstrated in the context of
hospital readmission among late-stage pancreatic cancer patients.

depending on the function or the solution space that they attempt to
approximate. This is mainly because of their homogenous configuration based
solely on the linear neuron model. Therefore, while they learn very well those
problems with a monotonous, relatively simple and linearly separable solution
space, they may entirely fail to do so when the solution space is highly
nonlinear and complex. Sharing the same linear neuron model with two additional
constraints (local connections and weight sharing), this is also true for the
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and, it is, therefore, not
surprising that in many challenging problems only the deep CNNs with a massive

performance. In order to address this drawback and also to accomplish a more
generalized model over the convolutional neurons, this study proposes a novel

heterogeneous and encapsulate neurons with any set of operators to boost
diversity and to learn highly complex and multi-modal functions or spaces with
minimal network complexity and training data. Finally, a novel training method

learning for classifying patches by extracting features from commit messages
and code changes. PatchNet contains a deep hierarchical structure that mirrors
the hierarchical and sequential structure of a code change, differentiating it
from the existing deep learning models on source code. PatchNet provides
several options allowing users to select parameters for the training process.
The tool has been validated in the context of automatic identification of
stable-relevant patches in the Linux kernel and is potentially applicable to
automate other software engineering tasks that can be formulated as patch
classification problems. A video demonstrating PatchNet is available at
https://goo.gl/CZjG6X. The PatchNet implementation is available at

  performance: A systems-oriented approach","27 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables",,"10.1016/j.physa.2019.121794",,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Financial markets can be seen as complex systems that are constantly evolving
and sensitive to external disturbance, such as systemic risks and economic
instabilities. Analysis of resilient market performance, therefore, becomes
useful for investors. From a systems perspective, this paper proposes a novel
function-based resilience metric that considers the effect of two
fault-tolerance thresholds: the Robustness Range (RR) and the Elasticity
Threshold (ET). We examined the consecutive resilience cycles and their
dynamics in the performance of two stock markets, NASDAQ and SSE. The proposed
metric was also compared with three well-documented resilience models. The
results showed that this new metric could satisfactorily quantify the
time-varying resilience cycles in the multi-cycle volatile performance of stock
markets while also being more feasible in comparative analysis. Furthermore,
analysis of dynamics revealed that those consecutive resilience cycles in
market performance were distributed non-linearly, following a power-law
behavior in the upper tail. Finally, sensitivity tests demonstrated the
large-value resilience cycles were relatively sensitive to changes in RR. In
practice, RR could indicate investors' psychological capability to withstand
downturns. It supports the observation that perception on the market's
resilient responses may vary among investors. This study provides a new tool
and valuable insight for researchers, practitioners, and investors when
evaluating market performance.

  Solving a Set of Spatial Puzzles","Submitted to Journal of Heuristics",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatial puzzles composed of rigid objects, flexible strings and holes offer
interesting domains for reasoning about spatial entities that are common in the
human daily-life's activities. The goal of this work is to investigate the
automated solution of this kind of puzzles adapting an algorithm that combines
Answer Set Programming (ASP) with Markov Decision Process (MDP), algorithm
oASP(MDP), to use heuristics accelerating the learning process. ASP is applied
to represent the domain as an MDP, while a Reinforcement Learning algorithm
(Q-Learning) is used to find the optimal policies. In this work, the heuristics
were obtained from the solution of relaxed versions of the puzzles. Experiments
were performed on deterministic, non-deterministic and non-stationary versions
of the puzzles. Results show that the proposed approach can accelerate the
learning process, presenting an advantage when compared to the non-heuristic
versions of oASP(MDP) and Q-Learning.

pseudo-polynomial time algorithms based on dynamic programming that can solve
it exactly. There are also the core branch and bound algorithms that can solve
large randomly generated instances in a very short amount of time. However, as
the correlation between the variables is increased, the difficulty of the
problem increases. Recently a new class of knapsack problems was introduced by
D. Pisinger called the spanner knapsack instances. These instances are
unsolvable by the core branch and bound instances; and as the size of the
coefficients and the capacity constraint increase, the spanner instances are
unsolvable even by dynamic programming based algorithms. In this paper, a
genetic algorithm is presented for spanner knapsack instances. Results show
that the algorithm is capable of delivering optimum solutions within a
reasonable amount of computational duration.

  Fiber Bundle",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A human brain is capable of continual learning by nature; however the current
mainstream deep neural networks suffer from a phenomenon named catastrophic
forgetting (i.e., learning a new set of patterns suddenly and completely would
result in fully forgetting what has already been learned). In this paper we
propose a generic learning model, which regards a learning system as a fiber
bundle. By comparing the learning performance of our model with conventional
ones whose neural networks are multilayer perceptrons through a variety of
machine-learning experiments, we found our proposed model not only enjoys a
distinguished capability of continual learning but also bears a high
information capacity. In addition, we found in some learning scenarios the
learning performance can be further enhanced by making the learning time-aware
to mimic the episodic memory in human brain. Last but not least, we found that
the properties of forgetting in our model correspond well to those of human
memory. This work may shed light on how a human brain learns.

number of the antenna is small which is often demanded in practice. The
simulation results show our design reduces overall phased array size, increases
optical power utilization while maintains comparable far field performance.

Results confirm the high energy and runtime costs of data movement, and the
benefits of the combiner optimization on these costs.
