of mobile clusters to minimize energy consumption in large-scale tracking

density and continuous mobility. Utilizing both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
technologies in smart phones, the technique tracks the movement of individuals
in a large crowd within a specific area, and monitors their current locations
and health conditions. The new system has several advantages, including good
positioning accuracy, low energy consumption, short transmission delay, and low
signal interference. Two types of interference are reduced: between Bluetooth
and Wi-Fi signals, and between different Bluetooth signals. An integer linear
programming model is developed to optimize the construction of clusters. In
addition, a simulation model is constructed and used to test the new technique
under different conditions. The proposed clustering technique shows superior
performance according to several evaluation criteria.

locomotion to allow for static friction. We then propose a robust iterative
numerical method to study the efficiency of a wide range of motions under

purpose of applying plasma processing to the Linac Coherent Light Source-II

affecting the high Q of nitrogen-doped cavities. The cleaning for LCLS-II will
follow the same plasma composition adopted at SNS, which allows in-situ

A novel method for plasma ignition has been developed at FNAL: a plasma glow
discharge is ignited using high order modes to overcome limitations imposed by
the fundamental power coupler, allowing in-situ cleaning for cavities in
cryomodule. The plasma can be easily ignited and tuned in each of the cavity
cells using low RF power. A method for plasma detection has been developed as

cylindrical domain $\Omega=(-h,h) \times G$, $G\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ smooth,
with the physical Dirichlet boundary conditions on the sides. Instead of
considering a vanishing vertical viscosity limit, we apply a direct approach
which in particular avoids unnecessary boundary conditions on top and bottom.
For the initial value problem, we obtain existence and uniqueness of local
$z$-weak solutions for initial data in $H^1((-h,h),L^2(G))$ and local strong
solutions for initial data in $H^1(\Omega)$. If $v_0\in H^1((-h,h),L^2(G))$,
$\partial_z v_0\in L^q(\Omega)$ for $q>2$, then the $z$-weak solution
regularizes instantaneously and thus extends to a global strong solution. This
goes beyond the global well-posedness result by Cao, Li and Titi (J. Func.

are in the set of solutions with small norms. Since this is a model with
hyperbolic and parabolic features for which classical results are not directly
applicable, such results for the time-periodic problem even for small forces
are not self-evident.

difficult challenge. We exploit the locality of the unsupervised Spike Timing
Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rule to target local representations in a
Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to adapt to novel information while protecting
essential information in the remainder of the SNN from catastrophic forgetting.
In our Controlled Forgetting Networks (CFNs), novel information triggers
stimulated firing and heterogeneously modulated plasticity, inspired by
biological dopamine signals, to cause rapid and isolated adaptation in the
synapses of neurons associated with outlier information. This targeting
controls the forgetting process in a way that reduces the degradation of
accuracy for older tasks while learning new tasks. Our experimental results on
the MNIST dataset validate the capability of CFNs to learn successfully over
time from an unknown, changing environment, achieving 95.36% accuracy, which we
believe is the best unsupervised accuracy ever achieved by a fixed-size,
single-layer SNN on a completely disjoint MNIST dataset.

to the complex regulatory machinery of the cell, gene regulatory network (GRN)

goal of this paper is to develop optimal classification of single-cell

Boolean dynamical systems (POBDS) are used for modeling gene regulatory
networks observed through noisy gene-expression data. We derive the exact
optimal Bayesian classifier (OBC) for binary classification of single-cell

due to computational and memory requirements. To address this, we introduce a
particle-based single-cell classification method that is highly scalable for
large GRNs with much lower complexity than the optimal solution. The
performance of the proposed particle-based method is demonstrated through
numerical experiments using a POBDS model of the well-known T-cell large

Equation $u_t=\Delta u^m$, posed in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega\subset

bounded positive solutions extinguish in a finite time $T>0$, and also that
they approach a separate variable solution $u(t,x)\sim (T-t)^{1/(1-m)}S(x)$, as
$t\to T^-$. It has been shown recently that $v(x,t)=u(t,x)\,(T-t)^{-1/(1-m)}$

from this result, we investigate the fine asymptotic behaviour and prove sharp
rates of convergence for the relative error. The proof is based on an entropy
method relying on a (improved) weighted Poincar\'e inequality, that we show to
be true on generic bounded domains. Another essential aspect of the method is
the new concept of ""almost orthogonality"", which can be thought as a nonlinear
analogous of the classical orthogonality condition needed to obtain improved
Poincar\'e inequalities and sharp convergence rates for linear flows.

embeddings such as i-vectors and d-vectors. Since different types of embeddings
are often complementary, this paper proposes a generic framework to improve
performance by combining them into a single embedding, referred to as a
c-vector. This combination uses a 2-dimensional (2D) self-attentive structure,
which extends the standard self-attentive layer by averaging not only across
time but also across different types of embeddings. Two types of 2D
self-attentive structure in this paper are the simultaneous combination and the
consecutive combination, adopting a single and multiple self-attentive layers
respectively. The penalty term in the original self-attentive layer which is
jointly minimised with the objective function to encourage diversity of
annotation vectors is also modified to obtain not only different local peaks
but also the overall trends in the multiple annotation vectors. Experiments on
the AMI meeting corpus show that our modified penalty term improves the d-
vector relative speaker error rate (SER) by 6% and 21% for d-vector systems,
and a 10% further relative SER reduction can be obtained using the c-vector

better justification for using these delay-type models. The Mori-Zwanzig
technique gives a formal rewriting of the system using a projection onto a set

computation of this memory term requires solving the orthogonal dynamics
equation, which represents the unresolved dynamics. For nonlinear systems, it
is often not possible to obtain an analytical solution to the orthogonal
dynamics and an approximate solution needs to be found. Here, we demonstrate
the Mori-Zwanzig technique for a two-strip model of the El Nino Southern

resulting nonlinear delay model contains an additional term compared to
previously proposed ad-hoc conceptual models. This new term leads to a larger

abundance patterns of the chemical elements in gradual solar energetic-particle
(SEP) events; those neglected abundances show a surprising new pattern of
behavior. Abundance enhancements of elements with 2 <= Z <= 56, relative to
coronal abundances, show a power-law dependence, versus their average
mass-to-charge ratio A/Q, that varies from event to event and with time during
events. The ion charge states Q depend upon the source plasma temperature T.
For most gradual SEP events, shock waves have accelerated ambient coronal
material with T < 2 MK with decreasing power-laws in A/Q. In this case, the
proton abundances agree rather well with the power-law fits extrapolated from
elements with Z >= 6 at A/Q > 2 down to hydrogen at A/Q = 1. Thus the
abundances of the elements with Z >= 6 fairly accurately predict the observed
abundance of H, at a similar velocity, in most SEP events. However, for those
gradual SEP events where ion enhancements follow positive powers of A/Q,
especially those with T > 2 MK where shock waves have reaccelerated residual
suprathermal ions from previous impulsive SEP events, proton abundances
commonly exceed the extrapolated expectation, usually by a factor of order ten.
This is a new and unexpected pattern of behavior that is unique to the
abundances of protons and may be related to the need for more streaming protons
to produce sufficient waves for scattering and acceleration of more heavy ions
at the shock.

provides heavy quasiparticles at room temperature. In heavy fermion systems
such localization is prototypically present only at liquid helium temperatures.
In these $f$-electron Kondo systems, conduction electrons magnetically couple
to localized moments, enhancing their mass and scatting time. These
quasiparticles may form Cooper pairs and cause unconventional superconductivity
with a critical temperature $T_c$ of the order of the Fermi energy
$\varepsilon_F$. In relative terms, this $T_c$ is much larger than in cuprate
or BCS superconductors for which $T_c\ll \varepsilon_F$. This suggests that
Kondo systems in general have the potential to be high-temperature
superconductors. For this to occur, strong correlations that cause electron
localization need to take place at much larger temperatures. Here we show that
metal hydrides manifest strong electron correlations in a single $3d_{x^2-y^2}$
band at the Fermi level, similar to the cuprates but at room temperature. Hole
doping of this band, by varying the hydrogen content, causes divergence of the
carrier mass and suggests the approach of an ordered Mott transition with
signatures of a correlated metallic Kondo lattice. These room-temperature
phenomena are expected to be widespread across hydrogen-rich compounds, and
offer a promising novel ground to encounter unconventional superconductivity in
the class of the metallic hydrides.

contribute to identifying and explaining influences of internal or external

study sensitivity of intra-cellular networks and to identify key intervention
pathways, by performing both static and dynamic sensitivity analysis. While the
static sensitivity analysis focuses on the impact of network topology and
update functions, the dynamic analysis accounts for context-dependent transient
state distributions. To study sensitivity, we use discrete models, where each
element is represented as a discrete variable and assigned an update rule,
which is a function of element's known direct and indirect regulators. Our
sensitivity analysis framework allows for assessing the effect of context on
individual element sensitivity, as well as on element criticality in reaching
preferred outcomes. The framework also enables discovery of most influential
pathways in the model that are essential for satisfying important system
properties, and thus, could be used for interventions. We discuss the role of
nine different network attributes in identifying key elements and intervention
pathways, and evaluate their performance using model checking method. Finally,
we apply our methods on the model of naive T cell differentiation, and further
demonstrate the importance of context-based sensitivity analysis in identifying
most influential elements and pathways.

of two distinct QMC which are not quasi-equivalent and their supports do not

remain recognizable for humans. Ullman et al. 2016 show that a slight
modification of the location and size of the visible region of the minimal
image produces a sharp drop in human recognition accuracy. In this paper, we
demonstrate that such drops in accuracy due to changes of the visible region
are a common phenomenon between humans and existing state-of-the-art deep
neural networks (DNNs), and are much more prominent in DNNs. We found many
cases where DNNs classified one region correctly and the other incorrectly,
though they only differed by one row or column of pixels, and were often bigger
than the average human minimal image size. We show that this phenomenon is
independent from previous works that have reported lack of invariance to minor
modifications in object location in DNNs. Our results thus reveal a new failure
mode of DNNs that also affects humans to a much lesser degree. They expose how
fragile DNN recognition ability is for natural images even without adversarial
patterns being introduced. Bringing the robustness of DNNs in natural images to
the human level remains an open challenge for the community.

in momentum space. Associated with each crossing point (or Weyl node) is an
integer topological invariant known as the Berry monopole charge. The discovery
of new classes of Weyl materials is driving the search for novel properties
that derive directly from the Berry charge. The circular photogalvanic effect
(CPGE), whereby circular polarized light generates a current whose direction
depends on the helicity of the absorbed photons, is a striking example of a
macroscopic property that emerges from Weyl topology. Recently, it was
predicted that the rate of current generation associated with optical
transitions near a Weyl node is proportional to its monopole charge and
independent of material-specific parameters. In Weyl semimetals that retain
mirror symmetry this universal photogalvanic current is strongly suppressed by
opposing contributions from energy equivalent nodes of opposite charge.
However, when all mirror symmetries are broken, as in chiral Weyl systems,
nodes with opposite topological charge are no longer degenerate, opening a
window of photon energies where the topological CPGE can emerge. In this work
we test this theory through measurement of the photon-energy dependence of the
CPGE in the chiral Weyl semimetal RhSi. The spectrum is fully consistent with a
topological CPGE, as it reveals a response in a low-energy window that closes
at 0.65 eV, in quantitative agreement with the theoretically-derived
bandstucture.

the increase in Gas-Fueled Power Plants (GFPP), have created significant
interdependencies between the electrical power and natural gas transmission
systems. However, despite their physical and economic couplings, these networks
are still operated independently, with asynchronous market mechanisms. This
mode of operation may lead to significant economic and reliability risks in
congested environments as revealed by the 2014 polar vortex event experienced
by the northeastern United States. To mitigate these risks, while preserving
the current structure of the markets, this paper explores the idea of
introducing gas network awareness into the standard unit commitment model.
Under the assumption that the power system operator has some (or full)
knowledge of gas demand forecast and the gas network, the paper proposes a
tri-level mathematical program where natural gas zonal prices are given by the
dual solutions of natural-gas flux conservation constraints and commitment
decisions are subject to bid-validity constraints that ensure the economic
viability of the committed GFPPs. This tri-level program can be reformulated as
a single-level Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone program which can then be solved
using a dedicated Benders decomposition. The approach is validated on a case
study for the Northeastern United States [1] that can reproduce the gas and
electricity price spikes experienced during the early winter of 2014. The
results on the case study demonstrate that gas awareness in unit commitment is
instrumental in avoiding the peaks in electricity prices while keeping the gas
prices to reasonable levels.

friction. We find that the total number of BHs increases significantly in this
region due to this process for lower mass SMBHs by up to a factor of 5, but
there is no increase in the vicinity of the highest mass SMBHs. Due to the high
BH number density in the NSC, BH-BH binaries form during close approaches due
to GW emission. We update the previous estimate of O'Leary et al. for the rate
of such GW capture events by estimating the $\langle n^2\rangle/\langle
n\rangle^2$ parameter where $n$ is the number density. We find a BH merger rate
for this channel to be in the range $\sim0.01-0.1 \, \mathrm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$.
The total merger rate is dominated by the smallest galaxies hosting SMBHs, and
the number of heaviest BHs in the NSC. It is also exponentially sensitive to
the radial number density profile exponent, reaching $>100 \,
\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ when the BH mass function is $m^{-2.3}$ or shallower

the change in the Bayesian posterior of the background only model and the
global p-value. We find that, as anticipated, the posterior converges to
certainty about the model as luminosity increases. The p-value, on the other
hand, randomly walks between 0 and 1 if the background only model is true, and
otherwise converges to 0. After briefly commenting on the frequentist
properties of the posterior, we make a direct comparison of the significances
obtained in Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We find that the well-known
look-elsewhere effect reduces local significances by about 1$\sigma$. We
furthermore find that significances from our Bayesian framework are typically
about 1 to 2$\sigma$ smaller than the global significances, though the
reduction depends on the prior, global significance and integrated luminosity.
This suggests that even global significances could significantly overstate the
evidence against the background only model. We checked that this effect --- the
Bayes effect --- was robust with respect to fourteen choices of prior and

Type 2 AGNs follow the same intrinsic Lx-L6um relation, suggesting that
mid-infrared emission is a reasonably good measure of the AGN accretion power
regardless of obscuration. We find that there is a strong increase in Type 1
AGN fraction toward higher AGN luminosity, possibly due to the fact that Type 1
AGNs tend to be hosted by more massive galaxies. The AGN luminosity and SFR are
consistent with an increase toward high stellar mass, while both the
Mstellar-dependence is weaker towards the high-mass end, which could be
interpreted as a consequence of quenching both star formation and AGN activity
in massive galaxies. AGN host galaxies tend to have SFRs that are consistent
with normal star-forming galaxies, independent of AGN luminosities. We confirm
that black hole accretion rate and SFR are correlated up to z~5, when forming
stars. The majority (~73%) of our AGN sample are faint in the far-infrared,
implying that the moderate-luminosity AGNs seem to be still active after the
star formation is suppressed. It is not certain whether AGN activity plays a
role in quenching the star formation. We conclude that both AGN activity and
star formation might be more fundamentally related to host stellar mass.

for a superconducting phase difference of zero, and a $\pi$-junction phase,
where the free energy has its minimum for a superconducting phase difference of
$\pi$. These transitions occur in the absence of Coulomb blockade or magnetic
impurities. Rather, they are driven by the spin orbit coupling in the junction,
and can be probed, for example, by measuring the tunneling density of states or
the critical current as a function of the junction's length or its Fermi

model for sequence generation based on insertion operations. Unlike typical
autoregressive models which rely on a fixed, often left-to-right ordering of
the output, our approach accommodates arbitrary orderings by allowing for
tokens to be inserted anywhere in the sequence during decoding. This
flexibility confers a number of advantages: for instance, not only can our
model be trained to follow specific orderings such as left-to-right generation
or a binary tree traversal, but it can also be trained to maximize entropy over
all valid insertions for robustness. In addition, our model seamlessly
accommodates both fully autoregressive generation (one insertion at a time) and
partially autoregressive generation (simultaneous insertions at multiple
locations). We validate our approach by analyzing its performance on the WMT
2014 English-German machine translation task under various settings for
training and decoding. We find that the Insertion Transformer outperforms many
prior non-autoregressive approaches to translation at comparable or better
levels of parallelism, and successfully recovers the performance of the
original Transformer while requiring only logarithmically many iterations
during decoding.

use its potential and the performance demands will only increase with the
upcoming generation of telescopes. In this paper, we study the possible impact
of High Performance Computing techniques on a performance-critical part of the
widely used lens modeling software LENSTOOL. We implement the algorithm once as
a highly optimized CPU version and once with graphics card acceleration for a
simple parametric lens model. In addition, we study the impact of finite
machine precision on the lensing algorithm. While double precision is the
default choice for scientific applications, we find that single precision can
be sufficiently accurate for our purposes and lead to a big speedup. Therefore
we develop and present a mixed precision algorithm which only uses double
precision when necessary. We measure the performance of the different
implementations and find that the use of High Performance Computing Techniques
dramatically improves the code performance both on CPUs and GPUs. Compared to
the current LENSTOOL implementation on 12 CPU cores, we obtain speedup factors
of up to 170. We achieve this optimal performance by using our mixed precision
algorithm on a high-end GPU which is common in modern supercomputers. We also
show that these techniques reduce the energy consumption by up to 98%.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that a highly competitive speedup can be reached
with consumer GPUs. While they are an order of magnitude cheaper than the
high-end graphics cards, they are rarely used for scientific computations due
to their low double precision performance. Our mixed precision algorithm
unlocks their full potential. The consumer GPU delivers a speedup which is only
a factor of four lower than the best speedup achieved by a high-end GPU.

convolutional filters are located in FS as overlapping 1D segments, and nearby
filters in FS share weights in their overlapping regions in a natural way. The
resultant neural network based on such weight sharing scheme, termed Filter
Summary CNNs or FSNet, has a FS in each convolution layer instead of a set of
independent filters in the conventional convolution layer. FSNet has the same
architecture as that of the baseline CNN to be compressed, and each convolution
layer of FSNet has the same number of filters from FS as that of the basline
CNN in the forward process. With compelling computational acceleration ratio,
the parameter space of FSNet is much smaller than that of the baseline CNN. In
addition, FSNet is quantization friendly. FSNet with weight quantization leads
to even higher compression ratio without noticeable performance loss. We
further propose Differentiable FSNet where the way filters share weights is
learned in a differentiable and end-to-end manner. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of FSNet in compression of CNNs for computer vision tasks
including image classification and object detection, and the effectiveness of
DFSNet is evidenced by the task of Neural Architecture Search.

species' molecular networks that uncovers similar network regions, thus
allowing for transfer of functional knowledge between the aligned nodes.
However, current NA methods do not end up aligning functionally related nodes.
A likely reason is that they assume it is topologically similar nodes that are
functionally related. However, we show that this assumption does not hold well.
So, a paradigm shift is needed with how the NA problem is approached. We
redefine NA as a data-driven framework, TARA (daTA-dRiven network Alignment),
which attempts to learn the relationship between topological relatedness and
functional relatedness without assuming that topological relatedness
corresponds to topological similarity, like traditional NA methods do. TARA
trains a classifier to predict whether two nodes from different networks are
functionally related based on their network topological patterns. We find that
TARA is able to make accurate predictions. TARA then takes each pair of nodes
that are predicted as related to be part of an alignment. Like traditional NA
methods, TARA uses this alignment for the across-species transfer of functional
knowledge. Clearly, TARA as currently implemented uses topological but not
protein sequence information for this task. We find that TARA outperforms
existing state-of-the-art NA methods that also use topological information,
WAVE and SANA, and even outperforms or complements a state-of-the-art NA method
that uses both topological and sequence information, PrimAlign. Hence, adding
sequence information to TARA, which is our future work, is likely to further
improve its performance.

degree to which these two aspects can be intertwined. In experiments on

stress-strain response under repeated compressive loading and find that the
aggregate's shear strength falls rapidly when compared to other particle
shapes. We probe the granular material at mm-scales with X-ray computed
tomography and $\mu$m-scales with high-resolution surface metrology to look for
the cause of the degradation. We find that wear due to accumulated deformation
smooths out the lens surfaces in a controlled and systematic manner that
correlates with a significant loss of shear strength observed for the assembly
as a whole. The sensitivity of lenses to changes in surface properties
contrasts with results for assemblies of 3D printed tetrahedra and spheres,
which under the same load cycling are found to exhibit only minor degradation
in strength. This case study provides insight into the relationship between
particle shape, surface wear, and the overall material response, and suggests
new strategies when designing a granular material with desired evolution of
properties under repeated deformation.

the sequence into K contiguous segments that are maximally homogeneous. A
classic approach to find the optimal solution is by using a dynamic program.
Unfortunately, the execution time of this program is quadratic with respect to
the length of the input sequence. This makes the algorithm slow for a sequence
of non-trivial length. In this paper we study segmentations whose measure of
goodness is based on log-linear models, a rich family that contains many of the

pressure of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC), whose goal is to campaign
for scholarly publishers to make their citations as totally open. This paper
investigates the growth of open citations with an experiment on the Italian

agents play a simple game on a graph: the probability of winning each round is
proportional to the agent's current power, and the winner gets more power as a
result. We show that, when the agents are distributed on simple 1D and 2D
networks, inequality grows naturally up to a certain stationary value
characterized by a clear division between a higher and a lower class of agents.
High class agents are separated by one or several lower class agents which
serve as a geometrical barrier preventing further flow of power between them.
Moreover, we consider the effect of redistributive mechanisms, such as
proportional (non-progressive) taxation. Sufficient taxation will induce a
sharp transition towards a more equal society, and we argue that the critical
taxation level is uniquely determined by the system geometry. Interestingly, we
find that the roughness and Shannon entropy of the power distributions are a
very useful complement to the standard measures of inequality, such as the Gini

surgery. The ability of a surgeon to reach patient remotely opens exciting
opportunities. Early experience with telerobotic surgery has been interesting,
but the clinical feasibility remains out of reach, largely due to the
deleterious effects of communication delays. Teleoperation tasks are
significantly impacted by unavoidable signal latency, which directly results in
slower operations, less precision in movements, and increased human errors.
Introducing significant changes to the surgical workflow, for example by
introducing semi-automation or self-correction, present too significant a
technological and ethical burden for commercial surgical robotic systems to
adopt. In this paper, we present three simple and intuitive motion scaling
solutions to combat teleoperated robotic systems under delay and help improve
operator accuracy. Motion scaling offers potentially improved user performance
and reduction in errors with minimal change to the underlying teleoperation
architecture. To validate the use of motion scaling as a performance enhancer
in telesurgery, we conducted a user study with 17 participants, and our results
show that the proposed solutions do indeed reduce the error rate when operating
under high delay.

distance/Hilbert-Schmidt covariance between two random vectors can be
approximated by the sum of squared componentwise sample cross-covariances up to
an asymptotically constant factor, which indicates that the
distance/Hilbert-Schmidt covariance based test can only capture linear
dependence in high dimension. As a consequence, the distance correlation based
t-test developed by Szekely and Rizzo (2013) for independence is shown to have
trivial limiting power when the two random vectors are nonlinearly dependent

seems to be discovered for the first time, is further confirmed in our
simulation study. As a remedy, we propose tests based on an aggregation of
marginal sample distance/Hilbert-Schmidt covariances and show their superior
power behavior against their joint counterparts in simulations. We further
extend the distance correlation based t-test to those based on Hilbert-Schmidt
covariance and marginal distance/Hilbert-Schmidt covariance. A novel unified
approach is developed to analyze the studentized sample
distance/Hilbert-Schmidt covariance as well as the studentized sample marginal
distance covariance under both null and alternative hypothesis. Our theoretical

that the transverse-traceless (TT) portion of the gravitational perturbations

source(s) outside the past null cone of the observer. This implies the TT
gravitational wave (GW) cannot be a standalone observable -- despite widespread
(apparent) claims in the gravitational wave literature to the contrary. About a
Minkowski background, all 4 of the gauge-invariant variables -- the two
scalars, one vector and tensor -- play crucial roles to ensure the spatial
tidal forces encoded within the gauge-invariant linearized Riemann tensor are
causal. These gravitational tidal forces do not depend solely on the TT
graviton but rather on the causal portion of its acceleration. However, in the
far zone radiative limit, the flat spacetime `TT' graviton Green's function
does reduce to the causal `tt' ones, which are the ones commonly used to
compute gravitational waveforms. Similar remarks apply to the spin-1 photon;
for instance, the electric field does not depend solely on the photon, but is
the causal part of its velocity. As is known within the quantum theory of
photons and linearized gravitons, there are obstacles to the construction of
simultaneously gauge-invariant and Lorentz-covariant descriptions of these
massless spin-1 and spin-2 states. Our results transparently demonstrate that
the quantum operators associated with the helicity-1 photon and helicity-2
linear graviton both violate micro-causality: namely, they do not commute
outside the light cone in flat and cosmological spacetimes.

systems such as the Earth's climate. In this context, functional climate
networks can be constructed using a spatiotemporal climate dataset and a
suitable time series distance function. The resulting coarse-grained view on
climate variability consists of representing distinct areas on the globe (i.e.,
grid cells) by nodes and connecting pairs of nodes that present similar time
series. One fundamental concern when constructing such a functional climate
network is the definition of a metric that captures the mutual similarity
between time series. Here we study systematically the effect of 29 time series
distance functions on functional climate network construction based on global
temperature data. We observe that the distance functions previously used in the
literature commonly generate very similar networks while alternative ones
result in rather distinct network structures and reveal different long-distance
connection patterns. These patterns are highly important for the study of
climate dynamics since they generally represent pathways for the long-distance
transportation of energy and can be used to forecast climate variability on
subseasonal to interannual or even decadal scales. Therefore, we propose the
measures studied here as alternatives for the analysis of climate variability
and to further exploit their complementary capability of capturing different
aspects of the underlying dynamics that may help gaining a more holistic
empirical understanding of the global climate system.

of new Galactic double neutron stars and GW170817, the first neutron star
merger event to be observed with gravitational waves, it is timely to revisit
this model. In order to constrain the mass distribution of double neutron
stars, we perform Bayesian inference using a sample of 17 Galactic double
neutron stars effectively doubling the sample used in previous studies. We
expand the space of models so that the recycled neutron star need not be drawn

different functional forms including uniform, single-Gaussian, and two-Gaussian

find positive support (a Bayes factor of 9) for the hypothesis that recycled

probable model---preferred with a Bayes factor of 29 over the conventional
model---is one in which the recycled neutron star mass is distributed according
to a two-Gaussian distribution and the non-recycled neutron star mass is
distributed uniformly. We show that precise component mass measurements of
$\approx 20$ double neutron stars are required in order to determine with high
confidence (a Bayes factor of 150) if recycled and non-recycled neutron stars
come from a common distribution. Approximately $60$ are needed in order to

consistency. Consistency in distributed computing systems has been employed in
three different applicable fields, such as system architecture, distributed

Initially, consistency models are categorized into three groups of
data-centric, client-centric and hybrid models. Each of which is then grouped
into three subcategories of traditional, extended, and novel consistency
models. Consequently, the concepts and procedures are expressed in mathematical
terms, which are introduced in order to present our models' behavior without
implementation. Moreover, we have surveyed different aspects of challenges with
respect to the consistency i.e., availability, scalability, security, fault
tolerance, latency, violation, and staleness, out of which the two latter i.e.
violation and staleness, play the most pivotal roles in terms of consistency
and trade-off balancing. Finally, the contribution extent of each of the
consistency models and the growing need for them in distributed systems are

collaboration has occurred between experimentalists and technicians, who offer
new physical tools to measure and manipulate neural function. In other
contexts, that collaboration has occurred between experimentalists and
theorists, who offer new conceptual tools to explain existing data and inform
new directions for empirical research. In this chapter, we offer an example of
the latter. Specifically, we focus on the simple but powerful framework of
linear systems theory as a useful tool both for capturing biophysically
relevant parameters of neural activity and connectivity, and for analytical and
numerical study. We begin with a brief overview of state-space representations
and linearization of neural models for non-linear dynamical systems. We then
derive core concepts in the theory of linear systems such as the impulse and
controlled responses to external stimuli, achieving desired state transitions,
controllability, and minimum energy control. Afterwards, we discuss recent
advances in the application of linear systems theory to structural and
functional brain data across multiple spatial and temporal scales, along with
methodological considerations and limitations. We close with a brief discussion
of open frontiers and our vision for the future.

  thin bi-Lipschitz domains","11 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work is part of a program of development of asymptotically sharp
geometric rigidity estimates for thin domains. A thin domain in three
dimensional Euclidean space is roughly a small neighborhood of regular enough
two dimensional compact surface. We prove an asymptotically sharp geometric
rigidity interpolation inequality for thin domains with little regularity. In
contrast to that celebrated Friesecke-James-M\""uller rigidity estimate
[\textit{Comm. Pure Appl. Math.,} 55(11):1461-1506, 2002] for plates, our
estimate holds for any proper rotations $\BR\in SO(3).$ Namely, the estimate
bounds the $L^p$ distance of the gradient of any $\By\in W^{1,p}(\Omega,\mathbb
R^3)$ field from any constant proper rotation $\BR\in SO(3)$, in terms of the
average $L^p$ distance (nonlinear strain) of the gradient $\nabla\By$ from the
rotation group $SO(3)$, and the average $L^p$ distance of the field itself from
the set of rigid motions corresponding to the rotation $\BR$. There are several
remarkable facts about the estimate: 1. The constants in the estimate are sharp
in terms of the domain thickness scaling for any thin domains with the required
regularity. 2. In the special cases when the domain has positive or negative
Gaussian curvature, the inequality reduces the problem of estimating the
gradient $\nabla\By$ in terms of the prototypical nonlinear strain
$\int_\Omega\mathrm{dist}^p(\nabla\By(x),SO(3))dx$ to the easier problem of
estimating only the vector field $\By$ in terms of the nonlinear strain without
any loss in the constant scalings as the Ans\""atze suggest. The later will be a
geometric rigidity Korn-Poincar\'e type estimate. This passage is major
progress in the thin domain rigidity problem. 3. For the borderline energy
scaling (bending-to-stretching), the estimate implies improved strong
compactness on the vector fields for free.

fluctuating intrinsic fields, which give rise to an additional dephasing-type
mechanism for washing out correlations. In particular, we establish two time
scales for characterizing fluctuations (i) the average time for a nanomagnet to
reverse|which for the experimentally relevant regime of low damping is governed
primarily by dephasing and becomes independent of $\alpha$, (ii) the time scale
for memory loss of a single nanomagnet|which scales as $\alpha^{-1/3}$ and is
governed by a combination of energy dissipation and dephasing mechanism. For
typical experimentally accessible values of intrinsic fields, the resultant
thermal-fluctuation rate is increased by multiple orders of magnitude when
compared with the bound set solely by the energy relaxation mechanism in
uniaxial magnets. This could lead to higher operating speeds of emerging
devices exploiting magnetic fluctuations.

particles themselves and the membrane environment in which they are suspended.
Experiments have shown that chiral rod-like inclusions dissolved in a colloidal
membrane of opposite handedness assemble into colloidal rafts, which are
finite-sized reconfigurable droplets consisting of a large but precisely
defined number of rods. Here, we systematically tune the chirality of the
background membrane, and find that in the achiral limit colloidal rafts acquire
fundamentally new structural properties and interactions. In particular, rafts
can switch between two chiral states of opposite handedness, which dramatically
alters the nature of the membrane-mediated raft-raft interactions. Rafts with
the same chirality have long-ranged repulsions, while those with opposite
chirality acquire attractions with a well-defined minimum. Both attractive and
repulsive interactions are explained by a continuum model that accounts for the
coupling between the membrane thickness and the local tilt of the constituent
rods. These switchable interactions enable assembly of colloidal rafts into
intricate higher-order architectures with unusual symmetries, including stable
tetrameric clusters and ""ionic crystallites"" of counter-twisting domains
organized on a binary square lattice. Furthermore, the properties of individual
rafts, such as their sizes, are controlled by their complexation with other
rafts. The emergence of these complex behaviors can be rationalized purely in
terms of generic couplings between compositional and orientational order of
fluids of rod-like elements. Thus, the uncovered principles might have
relevance for conventional lipid bilayers, in which the assembly of
higher-order structures is also mediated by complex membrane-mediated
interactions.

the interaction between a moving Aluminum plasma and a Nitrogen plasma at rest.
In the numerical experiment, the Nitrogen plasma is unmagnetized or magnetized
by a weak external magnetic field. Since the previous study suggested the
generation of spontaneous magnetic field in the piston (Aluminum) plasma due to
the Biermann battery, the effect of the magnetic field is of interest. Sharp
jumps of electron density and magnetic field are observed around the interface
between the two plasmas as long as one of the two plasmas is magnetized, which
indicates the formation of tangential electron-magneto-hydro-dynamic
discontinuity. When the Aluminum plasma is magnetized, strong compression of
both density and magnetic field takes place in the pure Aluminum plasma during
the gyration of Nitrogen ions in the Aluminum plasma region. The formation of a
shock downstream is indicated from the shock jump condition. The result
suggests that the spontaneous magnetic field in the piston (Aluminum) plasma
plays an essential role in the formation of a perpendicular collisionless
shock.

Our approach is based on time-domain moment matching framework, where we
optimize over families of parameterized reduced order models matching a set of

order models is in terms of the free parameters and of the interpolation
points. For this family of parameterized models we formulate an

that the error system admits a block diagonal observability Gramian, allowing
for a simple convex reformulation as semidefinite programming, but at the cost
of some performance loss. We also derive sufficient conditions to guarantee
block diagonalization of the Gramian. The second solution employs a gradient

magnetoresistance in Pr/Sm mono-antimonides/bismuthides (PrSb, SmSb, PrBi,
SmBi). Our photoemission measurements reveal that the bulk band inversion and
surface states are absent (present) in Pr/Sm antimonides (bismuthides),
implying that topological surface states are unlikely to play an important role
for the observed extreme magnetoresistance. We found that the electron-hole
compensation is well satisfied in all these compounds and the bulk band
structure exhibits no obvious temperature dependence from 10 K up to 150 K.
Simultaneous fittings of the magnetoresistance and Hall coefficient reveal that
the carrier mobility is dramatically enhanced at low temperature, which
naturally explains the suppression of extreme magnetoresistance at high
temperatures. Our results therefore show that the extreme magnetoresistance in
these compounds can be well accounted for by the two-band model with good
electron-hole compensation. Finally, we found that both PrSb and SmSb exhibit
highly linear bulk bands near the X point and lie close to the transition point
between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase, which might be relevant
for the observed anomalous quantum oscillations.

Poincar\'e Surface of Section technique, the islands of stability associated
with the 1:3 resonance are identified and studied. Along all its existence this
resonance showed to be doubled, producing pairs of periodic and quasi-periodic
orbits. The fact of being doubled introduces a separatrix, which generates a
chaotic layer that significantly reduces the size of the stable regions of the
1:3 resonance. The results also show that there is a minimum equivalent
eccentricity ($e_{1:3}$) for the existence of such resonance. This value seems
to be too high to keep a particle within the borders of the ring. On the other
hand, the Poincar\'e Surface of Sections show the existence of much larger
stable regions, but associated with a family of first kind periodic orbits.
They exist with equivalent eccentricity values lower than $e_{1:3}$, and
covering a large radial distance, which encompasses the region of the Haumea's
ring. Therefore, this analysis suggests the Haumea's ring is in a stable region
associated with a first kind periodic orbit instead of the 1:3 resonance.

dermoscopic images of skin. The challenge was hosted in 2018 at the Medical
Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) conference in
Granada, Spain. The dataset included over 12,500 images across 3 tasks. 900
users registered for data download, 115 submitted to the lesion segmentation
task, 25 submitted to the lesion attribute detection task, and 159 submitted to
the disease classification task. Novel evaluation protocols were established,
including a new test for segmentation algorithm performance, and a test for
algorithm ability to generalize. Results show that top segmentation algorithms
still fail on over 10% of images on average, and algorithms with equal
performance on test data can have different abilities to generalize. This is an
important consideration for agencies regulating the growing set of machine
learning tools in the healthcare domain, and sets a new standard for future
public challenges in healthcare.

  weighted graph states",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The instantaneous quantum polynomial time model (or the IQP model) is one of
promising models to demonstrate a quantum computational advantage over
classical computers. If the IQP model can be efficiently simulated by a
classical computer, an unlikely consequence in computer science can be obtained
(under some unproven conjectures). In order to experimentally demonstrate the
advantage using medium or large-scale IQP circuits, it is inevitable to
efficiently verify whether the constructed IQP circuits faithfully work. There
exists two types of IQP models, each of which is the sampling on hypergraph
states or weighted graph states. For the first-type IQP model, polynomial-time
verification protocols have already been proposed. In this paper, we propose
verification protocols for the second-type IQP model. To this end, we propose
polynomial-time fidelity estimation protocols of weighted graph states for each
of the following four situations where a verifier can (i) choose any
measurement basis and perform adaptive measurements, (ii) only choose
restricted measurement bases and perform adaptive measurements, (iii) choose
any measurement basis and only perform non-adaptive measurements, and (iv) only
choose restricted measurement bases and only perform non-adaptive measurements.
In all of our verification protocols, the verifier's quantum operations are
only single-qubit measurements. Since we assume no i.i.d. property on quantum
states, our protocols work in any situation.

particularly effective for weakly constrained SDPs. The key idea is to
formulate an approximate complementarity principle: Given an approximate
solution to the dual SDP, the primal SDP has an approximate solution whose
range is contained in the eigenspace with small eigenvalues of the dual slack
matrix. For weakly constrained SDPs, this eigenspace has very low dimension, so
this observation significantly reduces the search space for the primal
solution.
  This result suggests an algorithmic strategy that can be implemented with
minimal storage:
  (1) Solve the dual SDP approximately;
  (2) compress the primal SDP to the eigenspace with small eigenvalues of the
dual slack matrix;
  (3) solve the compressed primal SDP.
  The paper also provides numerical experiments showing that this approach is
successful for a range of interesting large-scale SDPs.

fundamental problem in healthcare informatics. A proper patient similarity
measure enables various downstream applications, such as cohort study and
treatment comparative effectiveness research. One major carrier for conducting
patient similarity research is Electronic Health Records(EHRs), which are
usually heterogeneous, longitudinal, and sparse. Though existing studies on
learning patient similarity from EHRs have shown being useful in solving real
clinical problems, their applicability is limited due to the lack of medical
interpretations. Moreover, most previous methods assume a vector-based
representation for patients, which typically requires aggregation of medical
events over a certain time period. As a consequence, temporal information will
be lost. In this paper, we propose a patient similarity evaluation framework
based on the temporal matching of longitudinal patient EHRs. Two efficient
methods are presented, unsupervised and supervised, both of which preserve the
temporal properties in EHRs. The supervised scheme takes a convolutional neural
network architecture and learns an optimal representation of patient clinical
records with medical concept embedding. The empirical results on real-world
clinical data demonstrate substantial improvement over the baselines. We make
our code and sample data available for further study.

subsonic, incompressible turbulence gives a model for turbulence that involves
eddies interacting on many length scales, and so the question has been asked:
is The Starry Night turbulent? To answer this question, we calculate the
azimuthally averaged power spectrum of a square region ($1165 \times 1165$
pixels) of night sky in The Starry Night. We find a power spectrum,
$\mathcal{P}(k)$, where $k$ is the wavevector, that shares the same features as
supersonic turbulence. It has a power-law $\mathcal{P}(k) \propto
k^{-2.1\pm0.3}$ in the scaling range, $34 \leq k \leq 80$. We identify a
driving scale, $k_\text{D} = 3$, dissipation scale, $k_\nu = 220$ and a
bottleneck. This leads us to believe that van Gogh's depiction of the starry

iron mononitride (FeN) thin films. Initial stages of film growth were trapped
utilizing synchrotron based soft x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy
(XANES) at the N $K$-edge and nuclear resonant scattering (NRS). Films were
grown using dc-magnetron sputtering, separately at the experimental stations of
SXAS beamline (BL01, Indus 2) and NRS beamline (P01, Petra III). It was found
that the initial stages of film growth differs from the bulk of it. Ultrathin
FeN films, exhibited larger energy separation between the t$_{2g}$ and e$_g$
features and an intense e$_g$ feature in the N $K$-edge pattern. This indicates
that a structural transition is taking place from the rock-slat (RS)-type FeN
to zinc-blende(ZB)-type FeN when the thickness of films increases beyond 5\,nm.
The behavior of such N $K$-edge features correlates very well with the
emergence of a magnetic component appearing in the NRS pattern at 100\,K in
ultrathin FeN films. Combining the \textit{in-situ} XANES and NRS measurements,
it appears that initial FeN layers grow in RS-type structure having a magnetic
ground state. Subsequently, the structure changes to ZB-type which is known to
be non-magnetic. Observed results help in resolving the long standing debate
about the structure and the magnetic ground state of FeN.

post-filter that provides inter-utterance pitch variation for deep neural
network (DNN)-based singing voice synthesis. The natural pitch variation of a
human singing voice leads to a richer musical experience and is used in
double-tracking, a recording method in which two performances of the same
phrase are recorded and mixed to create a richer, layered sound. However,
singing voices synthesized using conventional DNN-based methods never vary
because the synthesis process is deterministic and only one waveform is
synthesized from one musical score. To address this problem, we use a GMMN to
model the variation of the modulation spectrum of the pitch contour of natural
singing voices and add a randomized inter-utterance variation to the pitch
contour generated by conventional DNN-based singing voice synthesis.
Experimental evaluations suggest that 1) our approach can provide perceptible
inter-utterance pitch variation while preserving speech quality. We extend our
approach to double-tracking, and the evaluation demonstrates that 2) GMMN-based
neural double-tracking is perceptually closer to natural double-tracking than
conventional signal processing-based artificial double-tracking is.

appealing results on many tasks, they are too large to be deployed on edge
devices like smartphones or embedded sensor nodes. There have been efforts to
compress these networks, and a popular method is knowledge distillation, where
a large (teacher) pre-trained network is used to train a smaller (student)
network. However, in this paper, we show that the student network performance
degrades when the gap between student and teacher is large. Given a fixed
student network, one cannot employ an arbitrarily large teacher, or in other
words, a teacher can effectively transfer its knowledge to students up to a
certain size, not smaller. To alleviate this shortcoming, we introduce
multi-step knowledge distillation, which employs an intermediate-sized network
(teacher assistant) to bridge the gap between the student and the teacher.
Moreover, we study the effect of teacher assistant size and extend the
framework to multi-step distillation. Theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10,100 and ImageNet datasets and on CNN and ResNet
architectures substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

spatial approximations is sample dependent so that the computational effort at
each collocation point can be optimised individually. We outline a rigorous
analysis for the convergence and computational complexity of the adaptive
multilevel algorithm and we provide optimal choices for error tolerances at

multiple access (OTFS-MA), where delay-Doppler bins serve as the resource
blocks for multiple access. Different delay-Doppler resource blocks (DDRBs) in
the delay-Doppler grid are allocated to different users for multiple access. We
consider three different DDRB allocation schemes. While Scheme 1 multiplexes
the users along the delay axis, Scheme 2 multiplexes them along the Doppler
axis. In both these schemes, each user's signal spans the entire time-frequency
plane. Scheme 3 allocates the DDRBs in such a way that each user's signal is
limited to span only over a subset of the time-frequency plane. We study the
performance of OTFS-MA in high mobility environments on the uplink and compare
it with those of OFDMA and SC-FDMA. Our results show that OTFS-MA (with
maximum-likelihood detection in small dimension systems and with a message

1989 March event that caused the most intense geomagnetic storm of the space
age. Observations of these events in the historically weak solar cycle 24
indicate that a solar superstorm can occur in any solar cycle and at any phase
of the cycle. Recurrent patterns are identified in both cases, including the
long-lived eruptive nature of the active region, a complex event composed of
successive eruptions from the same active region, and in-transit interaction
between the successive eruptions resulting in exceptionally strong ejecta
magnetic fields at 1 AU. Each case also shows unique characteristics.
Preconditioning of the upstream solar wind leading to unusually high solar wind
speeds at 1 AU is observed in the first case whereas not in the latter. This
may suggest that the concept of ""preconditioning"" appears to be necessary for
making a Carrington-class storm. We find a considerable deflection by nearby
coronal holes in the second case but not in the first. On the basis of these
results, we propose a hypothesis for further investigation that superstorms are

  Station",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Urban wastewater sector is being pushed to optimize processes in order to
reduce energy consumption without compromising its quality standards. Energy
costs can represent a significant share of the global operational costs
(between 50% and 60%) in an intensive energy consumer. Pumping is the largest
consumer of electrical energy in a wastewater treatment plant. Thus, the
optimal control of pump units can help the utilities to decrease operational
costs. This work describes an innovative predictive control policy for
wastewater variable-frequency pumps that minimize electrical energy
consumption, considering uncertainty forecasts for wastewater intake rate and
information collected by sensors accessible through the Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition system. The proposed control method combines statistical
learning (regression and predictive models) and deep reinforcement learning
(Proximal Policy Optimization). The following main original contributions are
produced: i) model-free and data-driven predictive control; ii) control
philosophy focused on operating the tank with a variable wastewater set-point
level; iii) use of supervised learning to generate synthetic data for
pre-training the reinforcement learning policy, without the need to physically
interact with the system. The results for a real case-study during 90 days show
a 16.7% decrease in electrical energy consumption while still achieving a 97%
reduction in the number of alarms (tank level above 7.2 meters) when compared
with the current operating scenario (operating with a fixed set-point level).
The numerical analysis showed that the proposed data-driven method is able to
explore the trade-off between number of alarms and consumption minimization,
offering different options to decision-makers.

$2$ approximation was known before, the running time of the algorithm is at
least $\Omega(n^{256})$ in the worst case. Therefore, an $O(n)$ algorithm is
surprising and the best possible. We archive this result by calling an AEPTAS
with approximation guarantee $(1+\varepsilon)OPT +p_{\max}$ and running time of
the form $O(n\log(1/\varepsilon)+ f(1/\varepsilon))$ with a constant
$\varepsilon$ to schedule the jobs on a single cluster. This schedule is then
distributed on the $N$ clusters in $O(n)$. Moreover, this distribution
technique can be applied to any variant of of Multi Cluster Scheduling for
which there exists an AEPTAS with additive term $p_{\max}$.
  While the above result is strong from a theoretical point of view, it might
not be very practical due to a large hidden constant caused by calling an
AEPTAS with a constant $\varepsilon \geq 1/8$ as subroutine. Nevertheless, we
point out that the general approach of finding first a schedule on one cluster
and then distributing it onto the other clusters might come in handy in
practical approaches. We demonstrate this by presenting a practical algorithm

$9/4$-approximation for one third of all possible instances, i.e, all instances

  Stateful Load Balancers","IEEE International Conference on Communications 2019 (ICC'19)",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to scale web or other services, the load on single instances of the
respective service has to be balanced. Many services are stateful such that
packets belonging to the same connection must be delivered to the same
instance. This requires stateful load balancers which are mostly implemented in
software. On the one hand, modern packet processing frameworks supporting
software load balancers, such as the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), deliver
high performance compared to older approaches. On the other hand, common
Network Interface Cards (NICs) provide additional matching capabilities that
can be utilized for increasing the performance even further and in turn reduce
the necessary server resources. In fact, offloading the packet matching to
hardware can free up CPU cycles of the servers.
  Therefore, in this work, we propose the Hybrid NIC-offloading Load Balancer
(HNLB), a high performance hybrid hardware-software load balancer, utilizing
the NIC-offloading hardware matching capabilities. The results of our
performance evaluations show that the throughput using NIC offloading can be
increased by up to 50%, compared to a high performance software-only
implementation. Furthermore, we investigated the limitations of our proposed
approach, e.g., the limited number of possible concurrent connections.

swept helically such that the time information is uniformly encoded into the
angular distribution that allows one to characterize both the temporal profile

Brown-Twiss (HBT) correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider

originate from a substantial coherence of the particle-emitting sources. In
this work we investigate the normalized three- and four-pion HBT correlation
functions for evolving pion gas (EPG) sources with Bose-Einstein condensation.
We find that the intercepts of the normalized correlation functions at zero
relative momentum are sensitive to source condensation and particle momentum.
The normalized correlation functions in low average-momentum regions of three
and four pions decrease with decreasing temperature and increasing particle
number of the source, indicating a dependence of the normalized correlation
functions on source condensation. However, this dependence becomes weak in an
intermediate average-momentum region because particles with high momenta are
likely emitted from excited states incoherently in the EPG model, even if the
source has a considerable condensation fraction. For a wide momentum range, the
normalized correlation functions for low source temperatures are enhanced at
larger relative momenta because of a rapid increase of two-pion chaoticity
parameter with increasing particle momentum. We hope the significant
enhancement of the normalized four-pion correlation function at high relative
momentum will be identified through future analyses of experimental data.

two algorithms, both exploiting sparsity of a proper representation of the

the wave dissipation to the electron and anisotropic proton temperatures, we

Turing-like patterns may occur even in the absence of instabilities. Results

  at: https://github.com/jsegoviamartin/network_connectivity_dynamics_model",,,,"cs.SI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The distribution of cultural variants in a population is shaped by both
neutral evolutionary dynamics and by selection pressures, which include several
individual cognitive biases, demographic factors and social network structures.
The temporal dynamics of social network connectivity, i.e. the order in which
individuals in a population interact with each other, has been largely
unexplored. In this paper we investigate how, in a fully connected social
network, connectivity dynamics, alone and in interaction with different
cognitive biases, affect the evolution of cultural variants. Using agent-based
computer simulations, we manipulate population connectivity dynamics (early,
middle and late full-population connectivity); content bias, or a preference
for high-quality variants; coordination bias, or whether agents tend to use
self-produced variants (egocentric bias), or to switch to variants observed in
others (allocentric bias); and memory size, or the number of items that agents
can store in their memory. We show that connectivity dynamics affect the
time-course of variant spread, with lower connectivity slowing down convergence
of the population onto a single cultural variant. We also show that, compared
to a neutral evolutionary model, content bias accelerates convergence and
amplifies the effects of connectivity dynamics, whilst larger memory size and
coordination bias, especially egocentric bias, slow down convergence.
Furthermore, connectivity dynamics affect the frequency of high quality
variants (adaptiveness), with late connectivity populations showing bursts of
rapid change in adaptiveness followed by periods of relatively slower change,
and early connectivity populations following a single-peak evolutionary
dynamic. In this way, we provide for the first time a direct connection between
the order of agents' interactions and punctuational evolution.

While this technique is overshadowed by his more familiar differential equation
approach, it has found wide application as an illustration of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics. One reason for the reticence in its usage for conventional
quantum instruction is that the approach for simple problems like the
particle-in-a-box is much more complicated than the differential equation
approach, making it appear to be less useful for pedagogy. We argue that the
approach is still quite attractive because it employs only algebraic methods,
and thereby has a much lower level of math background needed to use it. We show
how Schroedinger's operator method can be streamlined for these
particle-in-a-box problems greatly reducing the complexity of the solution and
making it much more accessible. As an application, we illustrate how this
approach can be used to prove an important result, the existence of bound
states for one- and two-dimensional attractive potentials, using only algebraic
methods. The approach developed here can be employed in undergraduate classes
and possibly even high school classes because it employs only algebra and
requires essentially no calculus.
