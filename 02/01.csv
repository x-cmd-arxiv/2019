data, and causal model search to find the most probable graphical model
accounting for self-reported sleep efficiency (SE), sleep quality (SQ), and the
latent EDA factors. Structural equation modeling was used to confirm fit of the
extracted graph. Based on the generated graph, logistic regression and naive
Bayes models were used to test the efficacy of the EDA data in predicting SE
and SQ. Six EDA features extracted from the total signal over a night's sleep
could be explained by two latent factors, EDA Magnitude and EDA Storms. EDA
Magnitude performed as a strong predictor for SE to aid detection of
substantial changes in time asleep. The performance of EDA Magnitured and SE in
classifying SQ showed promise for wearable sleep monitoring applications.
However, our data suggest that obtaining a more accurate sensor-based measure
of SE will be necessary before smaller changes in SQ can be detected from EDA

reliable stellar parameters using a model atom built afresh for this work, and
check the consistency of our results over a wide wavelength range with
transitions of atomic and singly ionised calcium. Methods. We built and tested
Ca i and Ca ii model atoms with state-of-the-art radiative and collisional
data, and tested their performance deriving the Ca abundance in three benchmark
stars: Procyon, the Sun, and Arcturus. We have excellent-quality observations
and accurate stellar parameters for these stars. Two methods to derive the LTE

variation (CLV) of Ca lines in the Sun was also investigated. Results. The two
methods used give similar results in all three stars. Several discrepancies
found in LTE do not appear in our NLTE results; in particular the agreement
between abundances in the visual and infra-red (IR) and the Ca i and Ca ii
ionisation balance is improved overall, although substantial line-to-line
scatter remains. The CLV of the calcium lines around 6165 Angs can be partially

due to inhomogeneities in the atmosphere that require 3D modelling.

the constant-energy trajectory in phase space. This model has several salient
advantages as compared with the previous ones. The condensates are isolated
from their excitations by a finite gap, thus can greatly suppress the damping
effect induced by thermal atoms and Bogoliubov excitations. The oscillation
period can be tuned by several order of magnitudes without influencing other
parameters. In experiments, the dynamics can be mapped out from spin and

case of metric distance functions, metric index structures can be used to

effectively and efficiently, dispatch user's ride requests to the right driver

problem setting, which requires a sophisticated hand-crafted weight design for
either centralized authority control or decentralized multi-agent scheduling
systems. Although recent approaches have used reinforcement learning to provide
centralized combinatorial optimization algorithms with informative weight
values, their single-agent setting can hardly model the complex interactions
between drivers and orders. In this paper, we address the order dispatching
problem using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which follows the
distributed nature of the peer-to-peer ridesharing problem and possesses the
ability to capture the stochastic demand-supply dynamics in large-scale
ridesharing scenarios. Being more reliable than centralized approaches, our
proposed MARL solutions could also support fully distributed execution through
recent advances in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and the Vehicle-to-Network
(V2N). Furthermore, we adopt the mean field approximation to simplify the local
interactions by taking an average action among neighborhoods. The mean field
approximation is capable of globally capturing dynamic demand-supply variations
by propagating many local interactions between agents and the environment. Our
extensive experiments have shown the significant improvements of MARL order
dispatching algorithms over several strong baselines on the gross merchandise
volume (GMV), and order response rate measures. Besides, the simulated
experiments with real data have also justified that our solution can alleviate
the supply-demand gap during the rush hours, thus possessing the capability of
reducing traffic congestion.

main new difficulties arising in the free endpoint setting are defining the
endpoint geometry, identifying the extent of the 1D slender body force density,

gradient, only averaging to the real gradient. Standard approaches like
momentum or ADAM only consider a single direction, and do not try to model
distance from extremum - neglecting valuable information from calculated
sequence of gradients, often stagnating in some suboptimal plateau. Second
order methods could exploit these missed opportunities, however, beside
suffering from very large cost and numerical instabilities, many of them
attract to suboptimal points like saddles due to negligence of signs of
curvatures (as eigenvalues of Hessian).
  Saddle-free Newton method is a rare example of addressing this issue -
changes saddle attraction into repulsion, and was shown to provide essential
improvement for final value this way. However, it neglects noise while
modelling second order behavior, focuses on Krylov subspace for numerical
reasons, and requires costly eigendecomposion.
  Maintaining SFN advantages, there are proposed inexpensive ways for
exploiting these opportunities. Second order behavior is linear dependence of
first derivative - we can optimally estimate it from sequence of noisy
gradients with least square linear regression, in online setting here: with
weakening weights of old gradients. Statistically relevant subspace is
suggested by PCA of recent noisy gradients - in online setting it can be made
by slowly rotating considered directions toward new gradients, gradually
replacing old directions with recent statistically relevant. Eigendecomposition
can be also performed online: with regularly performed step of QR method to
maintain diagonal Hessian. Outside the second order modeled subspace we can
simultaneously perform gradient descent.

parameters are much larger than the number of samples used to train the
network. Even in such a regime deep architectures do not overfit. This
phenomenon is an active area of research and many theories have been proposed
trying to understand this peculiar observation. These include the Vapnik
Chervonenkis (VC) dimension bounds and Rademacher complexity bounds which show
that the capacity of the network is characterized by the norm of weights rather
than the number of parameters. However, the effect of input noise on these
measures for shallow and deep architectures has not been studied. In this
paper, we analyze the effects of various regularization schemes on the
complexity of a neural network which we characterize with the loss, $L_2$ norm
of the weights, Rademacher complexities (Directly Approximately Regularizing
Complexity-DARC1), VC dimension based Low Complexity Neural Network (LCNN) when
subject to varying degrees of Gaussian input noise. We show that $L_2$
regularization leads to a simpler hypothesis class and better generalization
followed by DARC1 regularizer, both for shallow as well as deeper

In order to obtain an increase in the classification accuracy for a given

learning method that we propose here. Funnelling consists of generating a
two-tier classification system where all documents, irrespectively of language,
are classified by the same (2nd-tier) classifier. For this classifier all
documents are represented in a common, language-independent feature space
consisting of the posterior probabilities generated by 1st-tier,
language-dependent classifiers. This allows the classification of all test
documents, of any language, to benefit from the information present in all
training documents, of any language. We present substantial experiments, run on
publicly available multilingual text collections, in which funnelling is shown
to significantly outperform a number of state-of-the-art baselines. All code

suspected malicious nodes. A crucial consideration in such settings is the
uncertainty endemic in detection, coupled with considerations of network

as well as failing to remove malicious nodes. A recent approach proposed to
address this problem directly tackles these considerations, but has a
significant limitation: it assumes that the decision maker has accurate
knowledge of the joint maliciousness probability of the nodes on the network.
This is clearly not the case in practice, where such a distribution is at best
an estimate from limited evidence. To address this problem, we propose a
distributionally robust framework for optimal node removal. While the problem
is NP-Hard, we propose a principled algorithmic technique for solving it
approximately based on duality combined with Semidefinite Programming
relaxation. A combination of both theoretical and empirical analysis, the
latter using both synthetic and real data, provide strong evidence that our
algorithmic approach is highly effective and, in particular, is significantly

This paper this paper proposes a method to transform the sentiment of sentences

that one sentence can be transformed to an opposite sentiment sentence and
should reduce by half the work required in the generation of text. The proposed
pipeline consists of a sentiment classifier with an attention mechanism to
highlight the short phrases that determine the sentiment of a sentence. Then,
these phrases are changed to phrases of the opposite sentiment using a baseline
model and an autoencoder approach. Experiments are run on both the separate
parts of the pipeline as well as on the end-to-end model. The sentiment
classifier is tested on its accuracy and is found to perform adequately. The
autoencoder is tested on how well it is able to change the sentiment of an

evaluation to judge the performance of the full (end-to-end) pipeline and that
reveals that a model using word vectors outperforms the encoder model.

of the topological invariant upon tuning a certain system parameter defines a

quantum criticality of the topological phase transitions in one to three
spatial dimensions, which simultaneously incorporates the symmetry
classification, order of band crossing, $m$-fold rotational symmetry,
correlation functions, critical exponents, scaling laws, and renormalization
group approach. We first classify higher-order Dirac models according to the
time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries, and determine the
even-oddness of the order of band crossing in each symmetry class. The
even-oddness further constrains the rotational symmetry $m$ permitted in a
symmetry class. Expressing the topological invariant in terms of a momentum
space integration over a curvature function, the order of band crossing
determines the critical exponent of the curvature function, as well as that of
the Wannier state correlation function introduced through the Fourier transform
of the curvature function. The conservation of topological invariant further
yields a scaling law between critical exponents. In addition, a renormalization
group approach based on deforming the curvature function is demonstrated for
all dimensions and symmetry classes. Through clarification of how the critical
quantities, including the jump of the topological invariant and critical
exponents, depend on the nonspatial and the rotational symmetry, our work

Metric-based and pattern-based methods have been presented for identifying
vulnerable code. The former relies on machine learning and cannot work well due
to the severe imbalance between non-vulnerable and vulnerable code or lack of
features to characterize vulnerabilities. The latter needs the prior knowledge
of known vulnerabilities and can only identify similar but not new types of
vulnerabilities.
  In this paper, we propose and implement a generic, lightweight and extensible
framework, LEOPARD, to identify potentially vulnerable functions through
program metrics. LEOPARD requires no prior knowledge about known
vulnerabilities. It has two steps by combining two sets of systematically
derived metrics. First, it uses complexity metrics to group the functions in a
target application into a set of bins. Then, it uses vulnerability metrics to
rank the functions in each bin and identifies the top ones as potentially
vulnerable. Our experimental results on 11 real-world projects have
demonstrated that, LEOPARD can cover 74.0% of vulnerable functions by
identifying 20% of functions as vulnerable and outperform machine
learning-based and static analysis-based techniques. We further propose three

determining tumor grade and treatment for patients. However, this task is often
challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of lung adenocarcinoma and the

model that automatically classifies the histologic patterns of lung
adenocarcinoma on surgical resection slides. Our model uses a convolutional
neural network to identify regions of neoplastic cells, then aggregates those
classifications to infer predominant and minor histologic patterns for any
given whole-slide image. We evaluated our model on an independent set of 143
whole-slide images. It achieved a kappa score of 0.525 and an agreement of
66.6% with three pathologists for classifying the predominant patterns,
slightly higher than the inter-pathologist kappa score of 0.485 and agreement
of 62.7% on this test set. All evaluation metrics for our model and the three
pathologists were within 95% confidence intervals of agreement. If confirmed in
clinical practice, our model can assist pathologists in improving
classification of lung adenocarcinoma patterns by automatically pre-screening
and highlighting cancerous regions prior to review. Our approach can be

a gecko spatula using a coupled adhesion-friction model. The objective is to
explain the strong attachment and easy detachment behaviour of the spatulae as
well as to understand the principles behind their optimum design. Using
nonlinear finite element computations, it is shown that during
tangentially-constrained peeling the partial sliding of the spatula pad near
the peeling front stretches the spatula, thus increasing the strain energy and
leading to high pull-off forces. The model is used to investigate the influence
of various parameters on the pull-off forces -- such as the peeling angle,
spatula shaft angle, strip thickness, and material stiffness. The model shows
that increasing the spatula pad thickness beyond a certain level does not lead
to a significant increase in the attachment forces. Further, the easy
detachment behaviour of geckos is studied under tangentially-free peeling
conditions. It is found that the spatulae readily detach from the substrate by
changing their shaft angle and eventually peel vertically like a tape. Since
the present computational model is not limited by the geometrical, kinematical,
and material restrictions of theoretical models, it can be employed to analyse
similar biological adhesive systems.

  Processes: A Scalable and Regularized Approach",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently there has been an increasing interest in the multivariate Gaussian
process (MGP) which extends the Gaussian process (GP) to deal with multiple
outputs. One approach to construct the MGP and account for non-trivial
commonalities amongst outputs employs a convolution process (CP). The CP is
based on the idea of sharing latent functions across several convolutions.
Despite the elegance of the CP construction, it provides new challenges that
need yet to be tackled. First, even with a moderate number of outputs, model
building is extremely prohibitive due to the huge increase in computational
demands and number of parameters to be estimated. Second, the negative transfer
of knowledge may occur when some outputs do not share commonalities. In this
paper we address these issues. We propose a regularized pairwise modeling
approach for the MGP established using CP. The key feature of our approach is
to distribute the estimation of the full multivariate model into a group of
bivariate GPs which are individually built. Interestingly pairwise modeling
turns out to possess unique characteristics, which allows us to tackle the
challenge of negative transfer through penalizing the latent function that
facilitates information sharing in each bivariate model. Predictions are then
made through combining predictions from the bivariate models within a Bayesian
framework. The proposed method has excellent scalability when the number of
outputs is large and minimizes the negative transfer of knowledge between
uncorrelated outputs. Statistical guarantees for the proposed method are
studied and its advantageous features are demonstrated through numerical
studies.

A popular strategy is Bayesian optimization (BO), which leverages probabilistic
models for this task. Most BO today uses Gaussian processes (GPs), or a few
other surrogate models. However, there is a broad set of Bayesian modeling
techniques that could be used to capture complex systems and reduce the number
of queries in BO. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are modern tools
that allow for flexible model definition, prior specification, model
composition, and automatic inference. In this paper, we develop ProBO, a BO
procedure that uses only standard operations common to most PPLs. This allows a
user to drop in a model built with an arbitrary PPL and use it directly in BO.
We describe acquisition functions for ProBO, and strategies for efficiently
optimizing these functions given complex models or costly inference procedures.
Using existing PPLs, we implement new models to aid in a few challenging
optimization settings, and demonstrate these on model hyperparameter and
architecture search tasks.

employs a range of mechanisms that have been developed to harden OAuth 2.0.
  In this paper, we perform a rigorous, systematic formal analysis of the

severe attacks, breaking authentication, authorization, and session integrity

output of light harvesting devices by reducing the rate of radiative

outputs in dimer systems which use quantum interference to generate dark
states. These models have typically been restricted to particular geometries
and to weakly coupled vibrational baths. Here we consider the
experimentally-relevant strong vibrational coupling regime with no geometric
restrictions on the dimer. We analyze how dark states can be formed in the
dimer by numerically minimizing the emission rate of the lowest energy excited
eigenstate, and then calculate the power output of the molecules with these
dark states. We find that there are two distinct types of dark states depending
on whether the monomers form homodimers, where energy splittings and dipole
strengths are identical, or heterodimers, where there is some difference.
Homodimers, which exploit destructive quantum interference, produce high power
outputs but strong phonon couplings and perturbations from ideal geometries are
extremely detrimental. Heterodimers, which are closer to the classical picture
of a distinct donor and acceptor molecule, produce an intermediate power output
that is relatively stable to these changes. The strong vibrational couplings
typically found in organic molecules will suppress destructive interference and
thus favour the dark-state enhancement offered by heterodimers.

weights. Polar codes select instead rows having the largest conditional mutual
information proceeding top to down in $G_m$; while this is a more elaborate and
channel-dependent rule, the top-to-down ordering has the advantage of making
the conditional mutual information polarize, giving directly a
capacity-achieving code on any binary memoryless symmetric channel (BMSC). RM
codes are yet to be proved to have such property.
  In this paper, we reconnect RM codes to polarization theory. It is shown that
proceeding in the RM code ordering, i.e., not top-to-down but from the lightest
to the heaviest rows in $G_m$, the conditional mutual information again
polarizes. We further demonstrate that it does so faster than for polar codes.
This implies that $G_m$ contains another code, different than the polar code
and called here the twin code, that is provably capacity-achieving on any BMSC.
This proves a necessary condition for RM codes to achieve capacity on BMSCs. It
further gives a sufficient condition if the rows with the largest conditional
mutual information correspond to the heaviest rows, i.e., if the twin code is
the RM code. We show here that the two codes bare similarity with each other

It turns out, that depending on the location of the coupling constant and the
energy level of the atom (with respect to certain constants depending on the
maximal and the minimal values of the boson energy) as well as the validity or
the violation of the infrared regularity type conditions, the essential
spectrum is either a single finite interval or a disjoint union of at most six
finite intervals. The corresponding critical values of the coupling constant
are determined explicitly and the asymptotic lengths of the possible gaps are
given when $\alpha$ approaches to the respective critical value. Under minimal
smoothness and regularity conditions on the boson dispersion relation and the

fully generic potentials. For illustration, we follow the evolution of
planetary orbits in a clumpy environment. We show that stochastic heating of
(mass-less) discs in a Keplerian potential leads to the formation, and
subsequent `evaporation' of Oort-like clouds, and derive analytical expressions
for the escape rate and the fraction of comets on retrograde orbits as a
function of time. Extrapolation of the subhalo mass function of Milky Way-like

state approximating energy equipartition, for example through many dynamical
encounters that exchange energy, their eccentricity distribution can be
described by : dN/de = 2e. This is referred to as the thermal eccentricity
distribution, and has been widely used for initial conditions in theoretical
investigations of binary stars. However, observations suggest that the
eccentricity distributions of most observed binaries, and particularly those
with masses < 5 Msun, are flatter than thermal and follow more closely to a
uniform distribution. Nonetheless, it is often argued that dynamical
interactions in a star cluster would quickly thermalize the binaries, which
could justify imposing a thermal eccentricity distribution at birth for all
binaries. In this paper we investigate the validity of this assumption. We
develop our own rapid semi-analytic model for binary evolution in star
clusters, and also compare with detailed N-body and Monte Carlo star cluster
models. We show that, for nearly all binaries, dynamical encounters fail to
convert an initially uniform eccentricity distribution to thermal within a star
cluster's lifetime. Thus, if a thermal eccentricity distribution is observed,
it is likely imprinted upon formation rather than through subsequent long-term
dynamical processing. Theoretical investigations that initialize all binaries
with a thermal distribution will make incorrect predictions for the evolution
of the binary population. Such models may overpredict the merger rate for
binaries with modest orbital separations by a factor of about two.

ground detections. In general, the merger signal of binaries observable by LISA
is strong enough to be unambiguously identified by both current and future

Recently we showed that the diffusive phase of this model exhibits extensive
mutual information of its non-equilibrium steady-state density matrix. We show
that that this extensive scaling persists in the entanglement and at the
localization critical point, before crossing over to a short-range (area-law)
scaling in the localized phase. We introduce an entanglement witness for
fermionic states that we name the mutual coherence, which, for fermionic
Gaussian states, is also a lower bound on the mutual information. Through a
combination of analytical arguments and numerics, we determine the finite-size

of halo formation time. We also repeat our key analyses across a broad range of
halo masses and for alternative formation time definitions. We show that
splashback subhaloes are responsible for two thirds of the assembly bias

have been removed, we find that the remaining assembly bias signal is due to a
relatively small fraction ($\lesssim 10\%$) of haloes in dense regions. We test
a number of additional physical processes thought to contribute to assembly
bias and demonstrate that the two key processes are the slowing of mass growth
by large-scale tidal fields and by the high velocities of ambient matter in
sheets and filaments. We also rule out several other proposed physical causes
of halo assembly bias. Based on our results, we argue that there are three
processes that contribute to assembly bias of low-mass halos: large-scale tidal

through keyword mapping and join path inference. Keyword mapping is the task of
mapping individual keywords in the original NLQ to database elements (such as
relations, attributes or values). It is challenging due to the ambiguity in
mapping the user's mental model and diction to the schema definition and
contents of the underlying database. Join path inference is the process of
selecting the relations and join conditions in the FROM clause of the final SQL

leveraging information from the SQL query log of a database to enhance the
performance of existing NLIDBs with respect to these challenges. We present a
system Templar that can be used to augment existing NLIDBs. Our extensive
experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, leading

a spectral embedding of the data regions provides coordinates that are used to

open a gap, the disc is separated into an inner, precessing disc and an outer
disc with a warp. In this work, we compute infrared scattered light images to
investigate the observational consequences of such an arrangement. We find that
an inner disc misaligned by a less than a degree to the outer disc is indeed
able to cast a shadow at larger radii. In our simulations a planet of around 6
Jupiter masses inclined by around 2 degrees is enough to warp the disc and cast
a shadow with a depth of more than 10% of the average flux at that radius. We
also demonstrate that warp in the outer disc can cause a variation in the
azimuthal brightness profile at large radii. Importantly, this latter effect is
a function of the distance from the star and is most prominent in the outer
disc. We apply our model to the TW Hya system, where a misaligned, precessing
inner disc has been invoked to explain an recently observed shadow in the outer
disc. Consideration of the observational constraints suggest that an inner disc
precessing due to a misaligned planet is an unlikely explanation for the

instance when a conducting boundary is introduced, dispersions of the particle
velocity may occur. As a consequence, besides the existence of classical
effects due to the interaction between particle and boundary, there will be a
quantum contribution to the motion of the particle whose magnitude depends on
how fast the transition between the different vacuum states occurs. Here this
issue is revisited and a smooth transition with a controllable switching time
between the vacuum states of the system is implemented. Dispersions of the
particle velocity in both, zero and finite temperature regimes are examined.
More than just generalizing previous results for specific configurations, new
effects are unveiled. Particularly, it is shown that the well known vacuum
dominance reported to occur arbitrarily near the wall is a consequence of
assumed idealizations. The use of a controllable switching enable us to
conclude that thermal effects can be as important as or even stronger than
vacuum effects arbitrarily near the wall. Additionally, the residual effect
predicted to occur in the late time regime was here shown to be linked to the
duration of the transition. In this sense, such effect is understood to be a
sort of particle energy exchanging due to the vacuum state transition.
Furthermore, in certain arrangements a sort of cooling effect over the motion
of the particle can occur, i.e., the kinetic energy of the particle is lessen
by a certain amount due to subvacuum quantum fluctuations.

survey. We simulate simplified Euclid VIS images including and excluding this
faint population, and measure the shift in the multiplicative shear bias
between the two sets of simulations. We measure the shear with three different
algorithms: a moment-based approach, model fitting, and machine learning. We
find that for all methods, a spatially uniform random distribution of faint
galaxies introduces a shear multiplicative bias of the order of a few times
$10^{-3}$. This value increases to the order of $10^{-2}$ when including the
clustering of the faint galaxies, as measured in the Hubble Space Telescope
Ultra-Deep Field. The magnification of the faint background galaxies due to the
brighter galaxies along the line of sight is found to have a negligible impact
on the multiplicative bias. We conclude that the undetected galaxies must be
included in the calibration simulations with proper clustering properties down
to magnitude 28 in order to reach a residual uncertainty on the multiplicative
shear bias calibration of a few times $10^{-4}$, in line with the
$2\times10^{-3}$ total accuracy budget required by the scientific objectives of

model for continuous outputs that uses multiple unstructured predictors to form
its features and at the same time exploits dependence structure among outputs,
which is provided by a similarity measure. In this paper, a Gaussian
conditional random fields model for structured binary classification (GCRFBC)
is proposed. The model is applicable to classification problems with undirected
graphs, intractable for standard classification CRFs. The model representation
of GCRFBC is extended by latent variables which yield some appealing
properties. Thanks to the GCRF latent structure, the model becomes tractable,
efficient and open to improvements previously applied to GCRF regression
models. In addition, the model allows for reduction of noise, that might appear
if structures were defined directly between discrete outputs. Additionally, two
different forms of the algorithm are presented: GCRFBCb (GCRGBC - Bayesian) and
GCRFBCnb (GCRFBC - non Bayesian). The extended method of local variational
approximation of sigmoid function is used for solving empirical Bayes in
Bayesian GCRFBCb variant, whereas MAP value of latent variables is the basis
for learning and inference in the GCRFBCnb variant. The inference in GCRFBCb is
solved by Newton-Cotes formulas for one-dimensional integration. Both models
are evaluated on synthetic data and real-world data. It was shown that both
models achieve better prediction performance than unstructured predictors.
Furthermore, computational and memory complexity is evaluated. Advantages and
disadvantages of the proposed GCRFBCb and GCRFBCnb are discussed in detail.

ordered arrays of immersed, flexible fibers. While specialized numerical
methods have been developed to study fluid-fiber systems, they become
infeasible when there are many, rather than a few, fibers present, nor do these
methods lend themselves to analytical calculation. Here, we introduce a
coarse-grained continuum model, based on local-slender body theory, for elastic
fibers immersed in a viscous Newtonian fluid. It takes the form of an
anisotropic Brinkman equation whose skeletal drag is coupled to elastic forces.
This model has two significant benefits: (1) the density effects of the fibers
in a suspension become analytically manifest, and (2) it allows for the rapid
simulation of dense suspensions of fibers in regimes inaccessible to standard
methods. As a first validation, without fitting parameters, we achieve very
reasonable agreement with 3D Immersed Boundary simulations of a bed of anchored
fibers bent by a shear flow. Secondly, we characterize the effect of density on
the relaxation time of fiber beds under oscillatory shear, and find close
agreement to results from full numerical simulations. We then study buckling
instabilities in beds of fibers, using our model both numerically and
analytically to understand the role of fiber density and the structure of
buckling transitions. We next apply our model to study the flow-induced bending
of inclined fibers in a channel, as has been recently studied as a flow
rectifier, examining the nature of the internal flows within the bed, and the
emergence of inhomogeneous permeability. Finally, we extend the method to study
a simple model of metachronal waves on beds of actuated fibers, as a model for
ciliary beds. Our simulations reproduce qualitatively the pumping action of
coordinated waves of compression through the bed.

under-sampled confocal microscopy samples. The well known and widely celebrated
total variation regularization, which is the L1 norm of derivatives, turns out
to be unsuitable for this problem; it is unable to handle both noise and
under-sampling together. This issue is linked with the notion of phase
transition phenomenon observed in compressive sensing research, which is
essentially the break-down of total variation methods, when sampling density
gets lower than certain threshold. The severity of this breakdown is determined
by the so-called mutual incoherence between the derivative operators and
measurement operator. In our problem, the mutual incoherence is low, and hence
the total variation regularization gives serious artifacts in the presence of
noise even when the sampling density is not very low. There has been very few
attempts in developing regularization methods that perform better than total
variation regularization for this problem. We develop a multi-resolution based
regularization method that is adaptive to image structure. In our approach, the
desired reconstruction is formulated as a series of coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution reconstructions; for reconstruction at each level, the
regularization is constructed to be adaptive to the image structure, where the
information for adaption is obtained from the reconstruction obtained at
coarser resolution level. This adaptation is achieved by using maximum entropy
principle, where the required adaptive regularization is determined as the
maximizer of entropy subject to the information extracted from the coarse
reconstruction as constraints. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
regularization method over existing ones using several reconstruction examples.

optimizing a noisy and costly ""black box""-like function in a high-dimensional
space. Despite progress in this field, there is no docking method available for
rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) of its solution quality (e.g.
interface RMSD or iRMSD).
  Results: We introduce a novel algorithm, Bayesian Active Learning (BAL), for
optimization and UQ of such black-box functions and flexible protein docking.
BAL directly models the posterior distribution of the global optimum (or native
structures for protein docking) with active sampling and posterior estimation
iteratively feeding each other. Furthermore, we use complex normal modes to
represent a homogeneous Euclidean conformation space suitable for
high-dimension optimization and construct funnel-like energy models for
encounter complexes. Over a protein docking benchmark set and a CAPRI set
including homology docking, we establish that BAL significantly improve against
both starting points by rigid docking and refinements by particle swarm
optimization, providing for one third targets a top-3 near-native prediction.
BAL also generates tight confidence intervals with half range around 25% of
iRMSD and confidence level at 85%. Its estimated probability of a prediction
being native or not achieves binary classification AUROC at 0.93 and AUPRC over
0.60 (compared to 0.14 by chance); and also found to help ranking predictions.
To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first uncertainty
quantification solution for protein docking, with theoretical rigor and
comprehensive assessment.

would result in a much faster convergence rate. We fill in this gap, and
provide simple closed form expressions for the expected smoothness constant and
careful numerical experiments verifying these bounds. Using these bounds, and
since the SAGA algorithm is part of this JacSketch family, we suggest a new
standard practice for setting the step sizes and mini-batch size for SAGA that
are competitive with a numerical grid search. Furthermore, we can now show that
the total complexity of the SAGA algorithm decreases linearly in the mini-batch
size up to a pre-defined value: the optimal mini-batch size. This is a rare
result in the stochastic variance reduced literature, only previously shown for
the Katyusha algorithm. Finally we conjecture that this is the case for many
other stochastic variance reduced methods and that our bounds and analysis of
the expected smoothness constant is key to extending these results.

cellular signaling systems and eventually activate oncogenic processes.
Therefore, understanding the functional impact of SGAs is a fundamental task in
cancer biology and precision oncology. Here, we present a deep neural network
model with encoder-decoder architecture, referred to as genomic impact
transformer (GIT), to infer the functional impact of SGAs on cellular signaling
systems through modeling the statistical relationships between SGA events and
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumors. The model utilizes a
multi-head self-attention mechanism to identify SGAs that likely cause DEGs, or
in other words, differentiating potential driver SGAs from passenger ones in a
tumor. GIT model learns a vector (gene embedding) as an abstract representation
of functional impact for each SGA-affected gene. Given SGAs of a tumor, the
model can instantiate the states of the hidden layer, providing an abstract
representation (tumor embedding) reflecting characteristics of perturbed
molecular/cellular processes in the tumor, which in turn can be used to predict
multiple phenotypes. We apply the GIT model to 4,468 tumors profiled by The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The attention mechanism enables the model
to better capture the statistical relationship between SGAs and DEGs than
conventional methods, and distinguishes cancer drivers from passengers. The
learned gene embeddings capture the functional similarity of SGAs perturbing
common pathways. The tumor embeddings are shown to be useful for tumor status

simulations of supersonic turbulence. Two sets of simulations, carried out
using a finite-volume code that evolves the hydrodynamic equations with an
approximate Riemann solver and a finite-difference code that solves the
Navier-Stokes equations, are tested against a number of criteria based on the
continuity equation, including exact results at statistically steady state. We
find that the spatial derivatives in the Navier-Stokes runs are accurate and
satisfy all the criteria. In particular, they satisfy our exact results that
the conditional mean velocity divergence, $\langle \nabla \cdot {\bs
u}|s\rangle$, where $s$ is the logarithm of density, and the conditional mean
of the advection of $s$, $\langle {\bs u} \cdot \nabla s|s\rangle$, vanish at
steady state for all density values, $s$. On the other hand, the Riemann solver
simulations fail all the tests that require accurate evaluation of spatial
derivatives, resulting in apparent violation of the continuity equation, even
if the solver enforces mass conservation. In particular, analysis of the
Riemann simulations may lead to the incorrect conclusion that the $\pdv$ work
tends to preferentially convert kinetic energy into thermal energy,
inconsistent with the exact result that the energy exchange by $\pdv$ work is
symmetric in barotropic supersonic turbulence at steady state. The inaccuracy
of spatial derivatives is a general problem in the post-processing of
simulations of supersonic turbulence with Riemann solvers. Solutions from such
simulations must be used with caution in post-processing studies concerning the
spatial gradients.

the $HST$ Treasury Program ""Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey"" (LEGUS). Cluster
identification and photometry in this subsample are similar to that of the
entire LEGUS sample, but special methods were developed to provide robust
catalogs with accurate fluxes due to low cluster statistics. The colors and
ages are largely consistent for two widely used aperture corrections, but a
significant fraction of the clusters are more compact than the average training
cluster. However, the ensemble luminosity, mass, and age distributions are
consistent suggesting that the systematics between the two methods are less
than the random errors. When compared with the clusters from previous dwarf
galaxy samples, we find that the LEGUS catalogs are more complete and provide
more accurate total fluxes. Combining all clusters into a composite dwarf
galaxy, we find that the luminosity and mass functions can be described by a
power law with the canonical index of $-2$ independent of age and global SFR
binning. The age distribution declines as a power law, with an index of
$\approx-0.80\pm0.15$, independent of cluster mass and global SFR binning. This
decline of clusters is dominated by cluster disruption since the combined star
formation histories and integrated-light SFRs are both approximately constant
over the last few hundred Myr. Finally, we find little evidence for an
upper-mass cutoff ($<2\sigma$) in the composite cluster mass function, and can
rule out a truncation mass below $\approx10^{4.5}$M$_{\odot}$ but cannot rule
out the existence of a truncation at higher masses.

atmospheric characterizations for these objects. Rotational phase mapping is a
powerful technique to constrain the condensate cloud properties in ultra-cool

angular momentum of substellar companions. Here, we present Hubble Space
Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 near-infrared time-resolved photometry for three
planetary-mass companions, AB Pic B, 2M0122B, and 2M1207b. Using two-roll
differential imaging and hybrid point spread function modeling, we achieve
sub-percent photometric precision for all three observations. We find tentative
modulations ($<\!\!2\sigma$) for AB Pic B and 2M0122B but cannot reach
conclusive results on 2M1207b due to strong systematics. The relatively low
significance of the modulation measurements cannot rule out the hypothesis that
these planetary-mass companions have the same vertical cloud structures as
brown dwarfs. Our rotation rate measurements, combined with archival period
measurements of planetary-mass companions and brown dwarfs do not support a
universal mass-rotation relation. The high precision of our observations and
the high occurrence rates of variable low-surface gravity objects encourage
high-contrast time-resolved observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.

Our aim is to understand how physical conditions inside a prominence slab
influence shapes and properties of emergent Mg II line profiles. We compute the
spectrum of Mg II lines using a one-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer code
for two large grids of model atmospheres (isothermal isobaric, and with a
transition region). The influence of the plasma parameters on the emergent
spectrum is discussed in detail. Our results agree with previous studies. We
present several dependencies between observables and prominence parameters
which will help with interpretation of observations. A comparison with known
limits of observed line parameters suggests that most observed prominences
emitting in Mg II h and k lines are cold, low pressure, and optically thick
structures. Our results indicate that there are good correlations between the
Mg II k line intensities and the intensities of hydrogen lines, as well as the
emission measure. One-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer codes are
well-suited to understand the main characteristics of the Mg II h and k line

segment a new image, the feature vectors are computed and clustered. Both
empirically and theoretically, it is unclear whether or when deep metric
learning is superior to the more conventional approach of directly predicting
an affinity graph with a convolutional net. We compare the two approaches using
brain images from serial section electron microscopy images, which constitute
an especially challenging example of instance segmentation. We first show that
seed-based postprocessing of the feature vectors, as originally proposed,
produces inferior accuracy because it is difficult for the convolutional net to
predict feature vectors that remain uniform across large objects. Then we
consider postprocessing by thresholding a nearest neighbor graph followed by
connected components. In this case, segmentations from a ""metric graph"" turn
out to be competitive or even superior to segmentations from a directly
predicted affinity graph. To explain these findings theoretically, we invoke
the property that the metric function satisfies the triangle inequality. Then
we show with an example where this constraint suppresses noise, causing
connected components to more robustly segment a metric graph than an
unconstrained affinity graph.

$\Omega(\frac{\lambda n}{\ln \lambda} + n \log n)$ evaluations to find any
desired target set of up to exponential size, with an overwhelming probability.
This yields lower bounds for the typical optimisation time on unimodal and

equipartition in non-linear ordered systems and the low temperature phase-space
fragmentation in disordered systems. We demonstrate that they are just two
manifestation of the same underlying phenomenon: ergodicity breaking. Inspired
by recent experiments, suggesting that lasing in optically active disordered
media is related to an ergodicity-breaking transition, we studied numerically a
statistical mechanics model for the nonlinearly coupled light modes in a
disordered medium under external pumping. Their collective behavior appears to
be akin to the one displayed around the ergodicity-breaking transition in
glasses, as we show measuring the glass order parameter of the
replica-symmetry-breaking theory. Most remarkably, we also find that at the
same critical point a breakdown of energy equipartition among light modes
occurs, the typical signature of ergodicity breaking in non-linear systems as
the celebrated Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model. The crucial ingredient of our system
which allows us to find equipartition breakdown together with replica symmetry
breaking is that the amplitudes of light modes are locally unbounded, i.e.,
they are only subject to a global constraint. The physics of random lasers
appears thus as a unique test-bed to develop under a unifying perspective the
study of ergodicity breaking in statistical disordered systems and non-linear
ordered ones.

blockchains have increased substantially. As a result, miners are heavily
incentivized to design and utilize Application Specific Integrated Circuits
(ASICs) that can compute hashes far more efficiently than existing general
purpose hardware. Currently, it is difficult for most users to purchase and
operate ASICs due to pricing and availability constraints, resulting in a
relatively small number of miners with respect to total user base for most
popular cryptocurrencies. In this work, we aim to invert the problem of ASIC
development by constructing a Proof-of-Work function for which an existing
general purpose processor (GPP, such as an x86 IC) is already an optimized
ASIC. In doing so, we will ensure that any would-be miner either already owns
an ASIC for the Proof-of-Work system they wish to participate in or can attain
one at a competitive price with relative ease. In order to achieve this, we
present HashCore, a Proof-of-Work function composed of ""widgets"" generated
pseudo-randomly at runtime that each execute a sequence of general purpose
processor instructions designed to stress the computational resources of such a
GPP. The widgets will be modeled after workloads that GPPs have been optimized
for, for example, the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suite for x86 ICs, in a technique
we refer to as inverted benchmarking. We provide a proof that HashCore is
collision-resistant regardless of how the widgets are implemented. We observe
that GPP designers/developers essentially create an ASIC for benchmarks such as
SPEC CPU 2017. By modeling HashCore after such benchmarks, we create a
Proof-of-Work function that can be run most efficiently on a GPP, resulting in
a more accessible, competitive, and balanced mining market.

models that generalize to novel testing domains with different statistics than
a set of known training domains. The simple approach of aggregating data from
all source domains and training a single deep neural network end-to-end on all
the data provides a surprisingly strong baseline that surpasses many prior
published methods. In this paper, we build on this strong baseline by designing
an episodic training procedure that trains a single deep network in a way that
exposes it to the domain shift that characterises a novel domain at runtime.
Specifically, we decompose a deep network into feature extractor and classifier
components, and then train each component by simulating it interacting with a
partner who is badly tuned for the current domain. This makes both components
more robust, ultimately leading to our networks producing state-of-the-art
performance on three DG benchmarks. Furthermore, we consider the pervasive
workflow of using an ImageNet trained CNN as a fixed feature extractor for
downstream recognition tasks. Using the Visual Decathlon benchmark, we
demonstrate that our episodic-DG training improves the performance of such a
general-purpose feature extractor by explicitly training a feature for
robustness to novel problems. This shows that DG training can benefit standard
practice in computer vision.

many-electron system cannot be exact for all one-electron densities. In 1981,
Perdew and Zunger (PZ) subtracted the fully-nonlocal self-interaction error
orbital-by-orbital, making the corrected functional exact for all collections
of separated one-electron densities, and making no correction to the exact
functional. Although the PZ self-interaction correction (SIC) eliminates many
errors of semi-local functionals, it is often worse for equilibrium properties
of sp-bonded molecules and solids. Non-empirical semi-local functionals are
usually designed to be exact for electron gases of uniform density, and thus
also make 0% error for neutral atoms in the limit of large atomic number Z, but
PZ SIC is not so designed. For localized SIC orbitals, we show analytically
that the LSDA-SIC correlation energy per electron of the uniform gas in the
high-density limit makes an error of -50% in the spin-unpolarized case, and
-100% in the fully-spin-polarized case. Then we extrapolate from the Ne, Ar,
Kr, and Xe atoms to estimate the relative errors of the PZ SIC
exchange-correlation energies (with localized SIC orbitals) in the limit of
large atomic number: about +5.5% for the local spin density approximation
(LSDA-SIC), and about -3.5% for nonempirical generalized gradient (PBE-SIC) and
meta-generalized gradient (SCAN-SIC) approximations. The SIC errors are
considerably larger than those that have been estimated for LSDA-SIC by
approximating the localized SIC orbitals for the uniform gas, and may explain
the errors of PZ SIC for equilibrium properties, opening the door to a
generalized SIC that is more widely accurate.

research. Analogy is particularly challenging for machines because it requires
relational structures to be represented such that they can be flexibly applied
across diverse domains of experience. Here, we study how analogical reasoning
can be induced in neural networks that learn to perceive and reason about raw
visual data. We find that the critical factor for inducing such a capacity is
not an elaborate architecture, but rather, careful attention to the choice of
data and the manner in which it is presented to the model. The most robust
capacity for analogical reasoning is induced when networks learn analogies by
contrasting abstract relational structures in their input domains, a training
method that uses only the input data to force models to learn about important
abstract features. Using this technique we demonstrate capacities for complex,
visual and symbolic analogy making and generalisation in even the simplest
neural network architectures.

supergravity makes the procedure simpler than that from $N=2$ Poincar\'e
supergravity, which makes it easier to show the correspondence to the standard

with experimental results including recent X-ray scattering. Then a crucial

the causal arrow with time-symmetric laws of physics.

yields two limiting regimes offering the 3D scale factor as a function of the

cosmology, offering a late-time behavior for the 3D scale factor after becoming
valid in the early universe, and can give rise to a late-time accelerated

volume regime solution, which offers a very early-time epoch of accelerated
expansion for a radiation-dominated universe for d=1. The time scales
describing these phenomena, including the transition from volume to fluid

architecture can match the structure of any optimizer-selected query execution
plan and predict its latency with high accuracy. We also propose a number of

well as new avenues in probing new physics beyond the Standard Model. Six years
after the discovery, with a conspicuously larger dataset collected during LHC
Run 2 at a 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy, the theory and experimental particle

precision measurements of its properties. This includes studies of Higgs boson
production and decays processes, the search for rare decays and production
modes, high energy observables, and searches for an extended electroweak

opportunities in Higgs physics during the High Luminosity phase of the LHC,
with an expected dataset of pp collisions at 14 TeV, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$. These studies are performed in light of
the most recent analyses from LHC collaborations and the latest theoretical

subpacketization in such a network. In particular, we propose a new approach
for both prefetching and linear delivery schemes based on a combinatorial
design called {\em hypercube}. We show that required number of packets per file
can be exponentially reduced compared to the state of the art scheme proposed
by Naderializadeh {\em et al.}, or the NMA scheme. When $M_TK_T+K_RM_R \geq
K_R$, the achievable one-shot sum-DoF using this approach is
$\frac{{M_TK_T+K_RM_R}}{{N}}$ , which shows that 1) the one-shot sum-DoF scales
linearly with the aggregate cache size in the network and 2) it is within a
factor of $2$ to the information-theoretic optimum. Surprisingly, the identical
and near optimal sum-DoF performance can be achieved using the hypercube
approach with a much less file subpacketization.

called Tsallis MDPs, with Tsallis entropy maximization, which generalizes
existing maximum entropy reinforcement learning (RL). A Tsallis MDP provides a
unified framework for the original RL problem and RL with various types of
entropy, including the well-known standard Shannon-Gibbs (SG) entropy, using an
additional real-valued parameter, called an entropic index. By controlling the
entropic index, we can generate various types of entropy, including the SG
entropy, and a different entropy results in a different class of the optimal
policy in Tsallis MDPs. We also provide a full mathematical analysis of Tsallis
MDPs, including the optimality condition, performance error bounds, and
convergence. Our theoretical result enables us to use any positive entropic
index in RL. To handle complex and large-scale problems, we propose a
model-free actor-critic RL method using Tsallis entropy maximization. We
evaluate the regularization effect of the Tsallis entropy with various values
of entropic indices and show that the entropic index controls the exploration
tendency of the proposed method. For a different type of RL problems, we find
that a different value of the entropic index is desirable. The proposed method

maximal effort in reducing the load and to not falsify the base load. We model
the problem of designing the contract by the DRA for the customer as a

capable of performing real-time inference using very deep models. Computations
associated with deep models for today's intelligent applications are typically
performed solely on the cloud. This cloud-only approach requires significant
amounts of raw data to be uploaded to the cloud over the mobile wireless
network and imposes considerable computational and communication load on the

of deep neural networks in mobile applications can be notably reduced by
splitting the workload between the mobile device and the cloud. In this
approach, referred to as collaborative intelligence, intermediate features
computed on the mobile device are offloaded to the cloud instead of the raw

low-complexity algorithms for efficiently solving such high-dimensional
regression tasks. Often, it is the case that side information (SI) is available
during reconstruction. For this reason a novel algorithmic framework that
incorporates SI into AMP, referred to as approximate message passing with side
information (AMP-SI), has been recently introduced. An attractive feature of
AMP is that when the elements of the signal are exchangeable, the entries of
the measurement matrix are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
Gaussian, and the denoiser applies the same non-linearity at each entry, the
performance of AMP can be predicted accurately by a scalar iteration referred
to as state evolution (SE). However, the AMP-SI framework uses different
entry-wise scalar denoisers, based on the entry-wise level of the SI, and
therefore is not supported by the standard AMP theory. In this work, we provide
rigorous performance guarantees for AMP-SI when the input signal and SI are
drawn i.i.d. according to some joint distribution subject to finite moment
constraints. Moreover, we provide numerical examples to support the theory
which demonstrate empirically that the SE can predict the AMP-SI mean square
error accurately.

learning tasks such as domain transfer, super resolution, and synthetic data

making them expensive to deploy for applications in low SWAP (size, weight, and
power) hardware, such as mobile devices, and for applications with real time
capabilities. There has been no work found to reduce the number of parameters
used in GANs. Therefore, we propose a method to compress GANs using knowledge
distillation techniques, in which a smaller ""student"" GAN learns to mimic a
larger ""teacher"" GAN. We show that the distillation methods used on MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and Celeb-A datasets can compress teacher GANs at ratios of 1669:1,
58:1, and 87:1, respectively, while retaining the quality of the generated

compression. Moreover, we observe that, with a fixed parameter budget,
compressed GANs outperform GANs trained using standard training methods. We
conjecture that this is partially owing to the optimization landscape of
over-parameterized GANs which allows efficient training using alternating
gradient descent. Thus, training an over-parameterized GAN followed by our
proposed compression scheme provides a high quality generative model with a
small number of parameters.

Enough frequency intervals between the bands. These are related with the
conditions which give good constraints on dust properties: the combination of
optically thick and thin bands are required, and large beta (beta is the
power-law index of dust opacity), and low dust temperature are preferable. To
examine our synthetic analysis results, we apply the multiband analysis to ALMA

social workers, in three key areas: (a) GUIDE proposes near-optimal solutions
that are shown, via extensive simulations, to significantly improve over the
traditional qualitative practices for forming intervention groups; (b) GUIDE is
able to identify circumstances when an intervention will lead to deviancy
training, thus saving time, money, and effort; (c) GUIDE can evaluate current
strategies of group formation and discard strategies that will lead to deviancy
training. In developing GUIDE, we are primarily interested in substance use

GUIDE is developed in collaboration with Urban Peak, a homeless-youth serving

these tasks assume accurate knowledge of the document date, this is not always
available, especially for arbitrary documents from the Web. Document Dating is
a challenging problem which requires inference over the temporal structure of
the document. Prior document dating systems have largely relied on handcrafted
features while ignoring such document internal structures. In this paper, we
propose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based document dating
approach which jointly exploits syntactic and temporal graph structures of
document in a principled way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
application of deep learning for the problem of document dating. Through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we find that NeuralDater
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline by 19% absolute (45%
relative) accuracy points.

  using Green Function Convolution","17 pages, single column scientific paper. Patent submitted",,,,"cs.CV cs.DM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In computer vision, the gradient and Laplacian of an image are used in
different applications, such as edge detection, feature extraction, and
seamless image cloning. Computing the gradient of an image is straightforward
since numerical derivatives are available in most computer vision toolboxes.
However, the reverse problem is more difficult, since computing an image from
its gradient requires to solve the Laplacian equation, also called Poisson
equation. Current discrete methods are either slow or require heavy parallel
computing. The objective of this paper is to present a novel fast and robust
method of solving the image gradient or Laplacian with minimal error, which can
be used for gradient domain editing. By using a single convolution based on a
numerical Green's function, the whole process is faster and straightforward to
implement with different computer vision libraries. It can also be optimized on
a GPU using fast Fourier transforms and can easily be generalized for an n
dimension image. The tests show that, for images of resolution 801x1200, the
proposed GFC can solve 100 Laplacian in parallel in around 1.0 milliseconds ms.
This is orders of magnitude faster than our nearest competitor which requires
294ms for a single image. Furthermore, we prove mathematically and demonstrate
empirically that the proposed method is the least error solver for gradient
domain editing. The developed method is also validated with examples of Poisson
blending, gradient removal, and the proposed gradient domain merging GDM.
Finally, we present how the GDM can be leveraged in future works for
convolutional neural networks CNN.

of the surrogates presented in the literature. Following this, we theoretically
study the surrogates at initialisation. We derive, using mean field theory, a
set of scalar equations describing how input signals propagate through the
randomly initialised networks. The equations reveal whether so-called critical
initialisations exist for each surrogate network, where the network can be
trained to arbitrary depth. Moreover, we predict theoretically and confirm
numerically, that common weight initialisation schemes used in standard
continuous networks, when applied to the mean values of the stochastic binary
weights, yield poor training performance. This study shows that, contrary to
common intuition, the means of the stochastic binary weights should be
initialised close to $\pm 1$, for deeper networks to be trainable.

potential as a thermoelectric material due to its ultralow thermal conductivity
and moderate electronic transport performance. As thermoelectric application
usually requires doped material, charge carriers can play a role in the thermal
transport in doped SnSe, but such an effect has not been clearly elucidated in
previous theoretical and experimental studies. Here we performed a fully
first-principles study on the effects of electrons to the thermal transport in
doped SnSe. The electron-phonon coupling (EPC) effects on both phonons and
charge carriers were considered using the mode specific calculation in our
work. It is found that for phonons, EPC are weak compared to the intrinsic
phonon-phonon scattering even at high carrier concentrations and thus have
negligible effects on the lattice thermal conductivity. The electronic thermal
conductivity is not negligible when the carrier concentration is higher than
$10^{19} cm^{-3}$ and the values can be as high as 1.55, 1.45 and 1.77
$Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ on a, b and c axes, respectively, for $10^{20} cm^{-3}$

and it is dependent on crystal orientations, carrier concentrations, and
carrier types. The simple estimation of electronic thermal conductivity using
Wiedemann-Franz law can cause large uncertainties for doped SnSe.

walks or crawling agents on the graph. Most of the works around MCMC, however,
presume that the graph is undirected or has reciprocal edges, and become
inapplicable when the graph is directed and non-reciprocal. Here we develop a
similar framework for directed graphs, which we call Non-Markovian Monte Carlo
(NMMC), by establishing a mapping to convert $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ into the
quasi-stationary distribution of a carefully constructed transient Markov chain
on an extended state space. As applications, we demonstrate how to achieve any

eigenvector centrality using a set of non-Markovian, history-dependent random

statistical hypothesis testing, especially when standard parametric assumptions
are not clear or likely to fail. However, in modern data science settings where
a large number of hypothesis tests need to be performed simultaneously, it is
rarely used due to its prohibitive computational cost. In genome-wide
association studies, for example, the number of hypothesis tests $m$ is around
$10^6$ while the number of MC samples $n$ for each test could be greater than
$10^8$, totaling more than $nm$=$10^{14}$ samples. In this paper, we propose
Adaptive MC multiple Testing (AMT) to estimate MC p-values and control false
discovery rate in multiple testing. The algorithm outputs the same result as
the standard full MC approach with high probability while requiring only
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}m)$ samples. This sample complexity is shown to be optimal.
On a Parkinson GWAS dataset, the algorithm reduces the running time from 2
months for full MC to an hour. The AMT algorithm is derived based on the theory
of multi-armed bandits.

popularity in modeling the kinematics of a serial-link robot, the
Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) notation is still the most widely used due to its
intuitive and concise geometric interpretation of the robot. This paper has
developed an analytical solution to automatically convert a POE model into a
D-H model for a robot with revolute, prismatic, and helical joints, which are
the complete set of three basic one degree of freedom lower pair joints for
constructing a serial-link robot. The conversion algorithm developed can be
used in applications such as calibration where it is necessary to convert the
D-H model to the POE model for identification and then back to the D-H model
for compensation. The equivalence of the two models proved in this paper also
benefits the analysis of the identifiability of the kinematic parameters. It is
found that the maximum number of identifiable parameters in a general POE model
is 5h+4r +2t +n+6 where h, r, t, and n stand for the number of helical,
revolute, prismatic, and general joints, respectively. It is also suggested
that the identifiability of the base frame and the tool frame in the D-H model
is restricted rather than the arbitrary six parameters as assumed previously.

contributed much of the polar flux and led to polar-field reversals. Multiple
reversals of dominant polarities at the Sun's poles were identified in Cycles
20 and 21. Three-fold reversals were caused by remnant flux surges of following
and leading polarities. Time-latitude analysis of solar magnetic fields in
Cycles 20--24 revealed zones which are characterized by a predominance of
negative (non-Joy's) tilts and appearance of active regions which violate
Hale's polarity law. The decay of non-Joy's and anti-Hale's active regions

use by a publisher of digital ads. We developed this system for JD.com, an
eCommerce company, which is also a publisher of digital ads in China. The
approach has two steps. The first step ('response modeling') fits a user-level
model for purchase of a product as a function of the user's exposure to ads.
The second ('credit allocation') uses the fitted model to allocate the
incremental part of the observed purchase due to advertising, to the ads the
user is exposed to over the previous T days. To implement step one, we train a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on user-level conversion and exposure data. The
RNN has the advantage of flexibly handling the sequential dependence in the
data in a semi-parametric way. The specific RNN formulation we implement
captures the impact of advertising intensity, timing, competition, and
user-heterogeneity, which are known to be relevant to ad-response. To implement
step two, we compute Shapley Values, which have the advantage of having
axiomatic foundations and satisfying fairness considerations. The specific
formulation of the Shapley Value we implement respects incrementality by
allocating the overall incremental improvement in conversion to the exposed
ads, while handling the sequence-dependence of exposures on the observed
outcomes. The system is under production at JD.com, and scales to handle the
high dimensionality of the problem on the platform (attribution of the orders

the symbol set that makes the two coincide. PLSTs are applicable to the
parameterized pattern matching problem, which is to decide whether the input
parameterized text has a substring that matches the input parameterized
pattern. The size of PLSTs is linear in the text size, with which our algorithm
solves the parameterized pattern matching problem in linear time in the pattern
size. PLSTs can be seen as a compacted version of parameterized suffix tries
and a combination of linear-size suffix tries and parameterized suffix trees.
We experimentally show that PLSTs are more space efficient than parameterized
suffix trees for highly repetitive strings.

distribution is two-stage, the most recognized low-income distribution is the
exponential form, and the high-income distribution is the recognized Pareto
power law distribution. The probability distribution can explain the entire
distribution of United States income data. In addition, the internal energy,
entropy and temperature of the United States income system can be calculated,

coupling between the different split rings is fully included at all orders. The
methods allow to calculate local field and Purcell factor enhancement arising

increased standard deviation of the Purcell-enhancement with disorder, making
it increasingly likely to find collective excitation eigenmodes with very high
Purcell factors that are also stronger for magnetic than electric excitations.

standard sirens, produced by the coalescence of double neutron stars and black
hole--neutron star binaries, provide an independent way to measure the
distances of GW sources, which are not affected by cosmic opacity. In this
paper, we first propose that combining the GW observations of third-generation
GW detectors with SN Ia data in similar redshift ranges offers a novel and
model-independent method to constrain cosmic opacity. Through Monte Carlo
simulations, we find that one can constrain the cosmic opacity parameter
$\kappa$ with an accuracy of $\sigma_{\kappa}\sim0.046$ by comparing the
distances from 100 simulated GW events and 1048 current Pantheon SNe Ia. The
uncertainty of $\kappa$ can be further reduced to $\sim0.026$ if 800 GW events
are considered. We also demonstrate that combining 2000 simulated SNe Ia and
1000 simulated GW events could result in much severer constraints on the
transparent universe, for which $\kappa=0.0000\pm0.0044$. Compared to previous
opacity constraints involving distances from other cosmic probes, our method
using GW standard sirens and SN Ia standard candles at least achieves
competitive results.

approximations such as the induced-interaction and parquet theories.
Notwithstanding their explanatory power, some theories have lacked an explicit
Hamiltonian from which all significant system properties, static and dynamic,
emerge canonically. This absence can complicate evaluation of the conserving
sum rules, essential consistency checks on the validity of any model. In a
series of papers Kraichnan introduced a stochastic embedding procedure to
generate explicit Hamiltonians for common approximations for the full many-body
problem. Existence of a Hamiltonian greatly eases the task of securing
fundamental identities in such models. I revisit Kraichnan's method to apply it
to correlation theories for which such a canonical framework has not been
available. I exhibit Hamiltonians for more elaborate correlated models
incorporating both long-range screening and short-range scattering phenomena.

traditional computers as their capabilities such as CPU computation, memory,
RAM size, and many more, are being enhanced almost to the level of conventional
computers. These capabilities are being exploited by mobile apps developers to
produce apps that offer more functionalities and optimized performance. To
ensure acceptable quality and to meet their specifications (e.g., design),
mobile apps need to be tested thoroughly. As the testing process is often
tedious, test automation can be the key to alleviating such laborious
activities. In the context of the Android-based mobile apps, researchers and
practitioners have proposed many approaches to automate the testing process
mainly on the creation of the test suite. Although useful, most existing
approaches rely on reverse engineering a model of the application under test
for test case creation. Often, such approaches exhibit a lack of
comprehensiveness as the application model does not capture the dynamic
behavior of the applications extensively due to the incompleteness of reverse
engineering approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes AMOGA, a
strategy that uses a hybrid, static-dynamic approach for generating user
interface model from mobile apps for model-based testing. AMOGA implements a
novel crawling technique that uses the event list of UI element associated with
each event to dynamically exercise the events ordering at the run-time to
explore the applications' behavior. Results of the experimental assessment
showed that AMOGA represents an alternative approach for model-based testing of
mobile apps by generating comprehensive models to improve the coverage of the

properties of single layer 1T-NbS$_2$. We find that single-layer 1T-NbS$_2$
undergoes a $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ star-of-David charge density wave.
Within the generalized gradient approximation, the weak interaction between the
stars leads to an ultraflat band at the Fermi level isolated from all other
bands. The spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation stabilizes a total
spin $1/2$ magnetic state with opening of a $0.15$ eV band gap and a
$0.21\mu_B$ magnetic moment localized on the central Nb in the star. Within
GGA+U, the magnetic moment on the central Nb is enhanced to $0.41\mu_{B}$ and a
larger gap occurs. Most important, this approximation gives a small energy
difference between the 1T and 1H polytypes (only $+0.5$ mRy/Nb), suggesting
that the 1T-polytype can be synthesized in a similar way as done for single
layer 1T-NbSe$_2$. Finally we compute first and second nearest neighbors

measure $\mathcal{M}_{T_X}=2.35^{+0.74}_{-0.55}$ and
$\mathcal{M}_{T_X}=2.02^{+0.74}_{-0.47}$ from the temperature jump, with {\it
Chandra} and {\it Suzaku} respectively. These values are consistent with the
Mach number estimate from a previous study of the radio spectral index, under
the assumption of diffusive shock acceleration ($\mathcal{M}_{\rm
RW}=2.4^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$). Interestingly, the western radio relic does not
entirely trace the X-ray shock. A possible explanation is that the relic traces
fossil plasma from nearby radio galaxies which is re-accelerated at the shock.
For the eastern relic we do not detect an X-ray surface brightness
discontinuity, despite the fact that radio observations suggest a shock with
$\mathcal{M}_{\rm RE}=2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$. The low surface brightness and
reduced integration time for this region might have prevented the detection.
{\it Chandra} surface brightness profile suggests $\mathcal{M}\lesssim1.5$,
while {\it Suzaku} temperature measurements found
$\mathcal{M}_{T_X}=1.54^{+0.65}_{-0.47}$. Finally, we also detect a merger
induced cold front on the western side of the cluster, behind the shock that
traces the western relic.

scattering process using a Fokker-Planck equation and apply this formalism to
several regimes of interest. In the first regime the density fluctuations are
considered quasi-static and diffusion in wavevector space is dominated by
angular diffusion on the surface of a constant energy sphere. In the
small-angle (""pencil beam"") approximation, this diffusion further occurs over a
small solid angle in wavevector space. The second regime corresponds to a much
later time, by which scattering has rendered the photon distribution
near-isotropic resulting in a spatial diffusion of the radiation. The third
regime involves time-dependent fluctuations and, therefore, Fermi acceleration
of photons. Combined, these results provide a comprehensive theoretical
framework within which to understand several important features of propagation
of radio burst waves in the solar corona: emitted photons are accelerated in a
relatively small inner region and then diffuse outwards to larger distances. En
route, angular diffusion results both in source sizes which are substantially
larger than the intrinsic source, and in observed intensity-versus-time
profiles that are asymmetric, with a sharp rise and an exponential decay. Both
of these features are consistent with observations of solar radio bursts.

priors that do not account for model structure. We present a new framework for
prior selection based on a hierarchical decomposition of the total variance
along a tree structure to the individual model components. For each split in
the tree, an analyst may be ignorant or have a sound intuition on how to
attribute variance to the branches. In the former case a Dirichlet prior is
appropriate to use, while in the latter case a penalised complexity (PC) prior
provides robust shrinkage. A bottom-up combination of the conditional priors
results in a proper joint prior. We suggest default values for the
hyperparameters and offer intuitive statements for eliciting the
hyperparameters based on expert knowledge. The prior framework is applicable
for R packages for Bayesian inference such as INLA and RStan.
  Three simulation studies show that, in terms of the application-specific
measures of interest, PC priors improve inference over Dirichlet priors when
used to penalise different levels of complexity in splits. However, when
expressing ignorance in a split, Dirichlet priors perform equally well and are
preferred for their simplicity. We find that assigning current state-of-the-art
default priors for each variance parameter individually is less transparent and
does not perform better than using the proposed joint priors. We demonstrate
practical use of the new framework by analysing spatial heterogeneity in

resulting into a mean relative error of less than 0.5% for low-thrust transfers

positive value for small electron energies, it changes sign after level
arising. We found that at the moments of arising in the well not only of the
first but also following s-levels as well, the time delay as a function of U
experiences instant jumps from a positive value to a negative one. The
amplitudes of these jumps increases with decrease of the electron wave vector
k. The times delay for potential well, the variation of the radius of which R
leads to the appearance of discrete levels, also change sign at these critical
radii.

materials, reaching reasonable thermal stability in optical data storage,
relies on mixing precise amounts of different dopants, resulting often in
quaternary or even more complicated compounds. Here we show how the simplest
material imaginable, a single element (in this case, antimony), can become a
valid alternative when confined in extremely small volumes. This compositional
simplification eliminates problems related to unwanted deviations from the

The time dependence of the trapped atoms indicates some difference of the

degrees of freedom between the geometry and the matter fields so as to build a
quantum field theory for the matter content with good quantum properties. We
investigate this issue in an inflationary, flat cosmology with inhomogeneous
perturbations, and focus the discussion on a Dirac field, minimally coupled to
the cosmological background and treated as a perturbation. After truncating the
action at the lowest nontrivial order in perturbations, one must define
canonical variables for the matter content, for which one generally employs
canonical transformations that mix the homogeneous background and the
perturbations. Each of these possible definitions comes associated with a
different matter contribution to the Hamiltonian of the complete system, that
may, in general, contain terms that are quadratic in creationlike variables,
and in annihilationlike variables, with the subsequent production and
destruction of pairs of fermionic particles and antiparticles. We determine a
choice of the fermionic canonical variables for which the interaction part of
the Hamiltonian can be made as negligible as desired in the asymptotic regime
of large particle/antiparticle wave numbers. Finally, we study the quantum
dynamics for this choice, imposing the total Hamiltonian constraint on the
quantum states and assuming that their gravitational part is not affected
significantly by the presence of fermions. In this way, we obtain a
Schr\""odinger equation for the fermionic degrees of freedom in terms of quantum
expectation values of the geometry that leads to asymptotically diagonal
Heisenberg relations and Bogoliubov evolution transformations, with no

Examples include string theory S-matrix for generic external momenta and
computation of the spectrum of string theory under a marginal deformation of
the world-sheet theory. The former requires us to define the S-matrix via
analytic continuation or as limits of contour integrals in complexified moduli
space, while the latter requires us to use an ultraviolet cut-off at
intermediate steps. In contrast, string field theory does not suffer from such
divergences. In this paper we show how string field theory can be used to
generate an explicit algorithm for computing tree level amplitudes in any
string theory that does not suffer from any short distance divergence from
integration over the world-sheet variables. We also use string field theory to
compute second order mass shift of string states under a marginal deformation
without having to use any cut-off at intermediate steps. We carry out the
analysis in a broad class of string field theories, thereby making it manifest
that the final results are independent of the extra data that go into the
formulation of string field theory. We also comment on the generalization of

considers multiple color spaces within the same model gives excellent levels of
accuracy. Also, we show that such a model, where the input is preprocessed into
multiple color spaces simultaneously, needs far fewer parameters to obtain high
accuracy for classification. For example, our model with 1.75M parameters
significantly outperforms DenseNet 100-12 that has 12M parameters and gives
results comparable to Densenet-BC-190-40 that has 25.6M parameters for

V~30. In this field we report the discovery of Bedin I a dwarf spheroidal
galaxy too faint and too close to the core of NGC 6752 for detection in earlier
surveys. As it is of broad interest to complete the census of galaxies in the
local Universe, in this Letter we provide the position of this new object along
with preliminary assessments of its main param eters. Assuming the same
reddening as for NGC 6752, we estimate a distance modulus of (m-M)_0 =
29.70+/-0.13 from the observed red giant branch, i.e., 8.7 (+0.5 -0.7) Mpc, and
size of ~840x340pc, about 1/5 the size of the LMC. A comparison of the observed
colour-magnitude diagram with synthetic counterparts that account for the
galaxy distance modulus, reddening and photometric errors, suggests the
presence of an old (~13Gyr) and metal poor ([Fe/H]~-1.3) population. This
object is most likely a relatively isolated satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxy
of the nearby great spiral NGC 6744, or potentially the most distant isolated
dwarf spheroidal known with a secure distance.

planets. They can lock these planets into an asynchronous rotation state of
equilibrium. We aim at characterizing the dependence of the tidal torque
resulting from the semidiurnal thermal tide on the tidal frequency, the planet
orbital radius, and the atmospheric surface pressure. The tidal torque is
computed from full 3D simulations of the atmospheric climate and mean flows
using a generic version of the LMDZ general circulation model (GCM) in the case
of a nitrogen-dominated atmosphere. Numerical results are discussed with the
help of an updated linear analytical framework. Power scaling laws governing
the evolution of the torque with the planet orbital radius and surface pressure
are derived. The tidal torque exhibits i) a thermal peak in the vicinity of
synchronization, ii) a resonant peak associated with the excitation of the Lamb
mode in the high frequency range, and iii) well defined frequency slopes
outside these resonances. These features are well explained by our linear
theory. Whatever the star-planet distance and surface pressure, the torque
frequency spectrum -- when rescaled with the relevant power laws -- always
presents the same behaviour. This allows us to provide a single and easily
usable empirical formula describing the atmospheric tidal torque over the whole
parameter space. With such a formula, the effect of the atmospheric tidal
torque can be implemented in evolutionary models of the rotational dynamics of

arises from the mismatch between the pre-relaxed geometry and that obtained
after a subsequent hybrid-DFT-level relaxation. The second occurs when defect
states edging an underestimated band gap artificially mix with crystalline
states, affecting the local bonding character of the defect, and therefore
leading the spurious hybrid-DFT energies. Due to cancelation effects, the
lingering strain contributes little ($\lesssim10$ meV) to the error bar of
quantities based on energy differences of pre-relaxed structures. The error
from state over-mixing does not benefit from cancelation effects and has to be

TCLs is firstly developed based on the migration of TCLs' room temperature
within the temperature hysteresis band. Then, considering the stochastic
consumers' behaviour and ambient temperature, the probability distribution
functions of reserve capacity provided by TCLs are obtained by cumulants. On
this basis, the states of reserve capacity and the corresponding probabilities
at each time instant are obtained for representing the reliability of operating
reserve provided by TCLs in the LZ-transform approach. Case studies are
conducted to validate the proposed technique.

magnetohydrodynamic shocks, one propagating upwards and the second one
propagating downwards in the solar atmosphere. The downward moving shock is
reflected at deep and dense atmospheric layers and triggers oscillations of
these layers. These oscillations generate the upwards moving
magnetohydrodynamic waves that can influence the above located magnetic

segmentation mask of the lane markings is predicted first, and a lane line
model (like a parabola or spline) is fitted to the post-processed mask next.
The problem with such a two-step approach is that the parameters of the network
are not optimized for the true task of interest (estimating the lane curvature
parameters) but for a proxy task (segmenting the lane markings), resulting in
sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a method to train a lane
detector in an end-to-end manner, directly regressing the lane parameters. The
architecture consists of two components: a deep network that predicts a
segmentation-like weight map for each lane line, and a differentiable
least-squares fitting module that returns for each map the parameters of the
best-fitting curve in the weighted least-squares sense. These parameters can
subsequently be supervised with a loss function of choice. Our method relies on
the observation that it is possible to backpropagate through a least-squares
fitting procedure. This leads to an end-to-end method where the features are
optimized for the true task of interest: the network implicitly learns to
generate features that prevent instabilities during the model fitting step, as
opposed to two-step pipelines that need to handle outliers with heuristics.
Additionally, the system is not just a black box but offers a degree of
interpretability because the intermediately generated segmentation-like weight
maps can be inspected and visualized. Code and a video is available at

been studied under various assumptions on the sensing capabilities of mobile

identical and indistinguishable, oblivious, and lack the capacity of direct
communication. At the beginning of unit-time intervals, the agents select
random headings in the plane and then detect the presence of other agents
behind them. Then they move forward only if no agents are detected in their
sensing ""back half-plane"". Two types of motion are considered: when no peers
are detected behind them, either the agents perform unit jumps forward, or they
start to move with unit speed while continuously sensing their back half-plane,
and stop whenever another agent appears there. For the first type of motion
extensive empirical evidence suggests that with high probability clustering
occurs in finite expected time to a small region with diameter of about the
size of the unit jump, while for continuous sensing and motion we can prove
gathering in finite expected time if a ""blind-zone"" is assumed in their sensing
half-plane. Relationships between the number of agents or the size of the
blind-zone and convergence time are empirically studied and compared to a
theoretical upper-bound dependent on these factors.

characterized in detail for both piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties and
their energy harvesting performance figures of merit were assessed parallel and
perpendicular to the freezing direction. As a result of the introduction of
porosity into the ceramic microstrucutre, high piezoelectric and pyroelectric

to dense PZT due to the reduced permittivity and volume specific heat capacity.
Experimental results were compared to parallel and series analytical models
with good agreement and the PZT with porosity aligned parallel to the freezing
direction exhibited the highest piezoelectric and pyroelectric harvesting
response; this was a result of the enhanced interconnectivity of the
ferroelectric material along the poling direction and reduced fraction of
unpoled material that leads to a higher polarization. A complete thermal energy
harvesting system, composed of an parallel-aligned PZT harvester element and an
AC/DC converter successfully demonstrated by charging a storage capacitor. The
maximum energy density generated by the 60 vol.% porous parallel-connected PZT

that evolutionary algorithms, despite usually being robust problem solvers, can

started with a random Hamming neighbor of the optimum, the (1+1) evolutionary

re-optimizing a structurally good solution.

optimization structurally good solutions can easily be replaced by structurally
worse solutions of equal or better fitness. We propose a simple diversity
mechanism that prevents this behavior, thereby reducing the re-optimization

thresholds, they are calculated from individual active region with the average
of 75/77/57 G for $B_{x}$/$B_{y}$/$B_{z}$ for all original data. When the

acceleration site for High Energy Cosmic Rays (HECRs) and a recent model showed
that the HECR data can be explained by these sources, if the arrival directions
of HECRs at energies $\lesssim 8\,\text{EeV}$ from a certain RG, Cygnus A, are
isotropized.
  First, this work introduces the inverted simulation setup in order to probe
the isotropy assumption. Here, different extragalactic magnetic field models
are compared showing that either a magnetic field of primordial origin that
yields a high field strength in the large scale structures of the Universe is
needed, or a significant contribution by a multitude of isotropically
distributed sources.
  Secondly, the HECRs contribution by the bulk of RGs of different
Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type is determined. Here, the most recent FR-type dependent
radio-to-CR correlations $Q_{\rm cr}\propto L_{\rm radio}^{\beta_L}$ are used,
and the impact of the slope $\beta_L$ on the HECRs is analyzed in detail.
Finally, it is carved out that FR-II RGs provide a promising spectral behavior
at the hardening part of the CR flux, between about $3\,\text{EeV}$ and
$30\,\text{EeV}$, but most likely not enough CR power. At these energies, FR-I
RGs can only provide an appropriate flux in the case of a high acceleration
efficiency and $\beta_L\gtrsim 0.9$, otherwise these sources rather contribute
below $3\,\text{EeV}$. Further, the required acceleration efficiency for a
significant HECR contribution is exposed dependent on $\beta_L$ and the CR
spectrum at the acceleration site.

at detecting underlying patterns in the distribution of photometric spots in a

the magnetic field topology. Photometric time-series observations from the
ASAS-3 archive were employed to inspect the light-curve morphology of our

numerous simulations assuming different spot parameters and following the
symmetry of a simple dipole magnetic field. These were subsequently compared
with the observed light curves. The results from our simulations are in
contradiction with the observations and predict a much higher percentage of
doublewave light curves than is actually observed. We thereby conclude that the
distribution of the chemical spots does not follow the magnetic field topology,

a given knowledge base. Previous studies have highlighted the necessity for
entity linking systems to capture the global coherence. However, there are two
common weaknesses in previous global models. First, most of them calculate the
pairwise scores between all candidate entities and select the most relevant
group of entities as the final result. In this process, the consistency among
wrong entities as well as that among right ones are involved, which may
introduce noise data and increase the model complexity. Second, the cues of
previously disambiguated entities, which could contribute to the disambiguation
of the subsequent mentions, are usually ignored by previous models. To address
these problems, we convert the global linking into a sequence decision problem
and propose a reinforcement learning model which makes decisions from a global
perspective. Our model makes full use of the previous referred entities and
explores the long-term influence of current selection on subsequent decisions.
We conduct experiments on different types of datasets, the results show that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art systems and has better generalization

examination of the influence of porosity volume fraction and morphology on the

of the electric field distribution and a decrease in the electric field
experienced by the ferroelectric ceramic medium due to the presence of
low-permittivity pores is examined and its implications on the shape of the
hysteresis loop, remnant polarisation and coercive field is discussed. The
variation of coercive field with porosity level is seen to be complex and is
attributed to two competing mechanisms where at high porosity levels the
influence of the broadening of the electric field distribution dominates, while
at low porosity levels an increase in the compliance of the matrix is more
important. This new approach to understanding these materials enables the
seemingly conflicting observations in the existing literature to be clarified
and provides an effective approach to interpret the influence of pore fraction
and morphology on the polarisation behaviour of ferroelectrics. Such
information provides new insights in the interpretation of the physical
properties of porous ferroelectric materials to inform future effort in the

This approach guarantees that sensitive information cannot be exploited by any

introduces a sensitive information removal function in the learning objective.
The method is evaluated on three different primary tasks (identity,

key implication of the framework is that standard ways of thinking about

determining the dynamic multivariate structure of brain data. Accordingly,
central problems become to characterize the dimensionality of neural

more general operational theories of physics. In this thesis, we develop an
approach to the study of such theories purely in terms of the behaviour of
their processes, as described mathematically through the language of category
theory. This extends a framework for quantum processes known as categorical
quantum mechanics (CQM) due to Abramsky and Coecke.
  We first consider categorical frameworks for operational theories. We
introduce a notion of such theory, based on those of Chiribella, D'Ariano and
Perinotti (CDP), but more general than the probabilistic ones typically
considered. We establish a correspondence between these and what we call
""operational categories"", using features introduced by Jacobs et al. in
effectus theory, an area of categorical logic to which we provide an
operational interpretation. We then see how to pass to a broader category of
""super-causal"" processes, allowing for the powerful diagrammatic features of
CQM.
  Next we study operational theories themselves. We survey numerous principles
that a theory may satisfy, treating them in a basic diagrammatic setting, and
relating notions from probabilistic theories, CQM and effectus theory. We
provide a new description of superpositions in the category of pure quantum
processes, using this to give an abstract construction of the category of
Hilbert spaces and linear maps.
  Finally, we reconstruct finite-dimensional quantum theory itself. More
broadly, we give a recipe for recovering a class of generalised quantum
theories, before instantiating it with operational principles inspired by an
earlier reconstruction due to CDP. This reconstruction is fully categorical,
not requiring the usual technical assumptions of probabilistic theories.
Specialising to such theories recovers both standard quantum theory and that
over real Hilbert spaces.

Matched Multi-Filter (MMF) technique and an optimised Internal Linear
Combination (ILC). We show that when applying the MMF to the combination of ACT
and Planck data, the size-flux degeneracy is reduced and the signal-to-noise of
clusters detected with their SZ signal improves by up to a factor of three. In
the case of the optimised ILC method, we show that the tSZ map is reconstructed
with a resolution of $\sim 1.5$ arcmin. This is more than a factor two
improvement compared with the Planck resolution, and with a very good control
of noise, i.e. limited only by the intrinsic noise of the individual
experiments. The combination of ACT and Planck data offers a unique opportunity
to improve on the study of the pressure profiles and to study substructure in
clusters through their tSZ.

that emotion and motivation need to be integrated with all aspects of the
architecture. Thus, cognitive-emotional integration is a key design principle.
Emotion is not an ""add on"" that endows a robot with ""feelings"" (for instance,
reporting or expressing its internal state). It allows the significance of
percepts, plans, and actions to be an integral part of all its computations. It
is hypothesized that a sophisticated artificial intelligence cannot be built

the Turing test, called the Dolores test, is proposed to test this assertion.

secondary magnetic field caused by the application of a stronger primary
magnetic field. Both the in-phase and quadrature component of the secondary
field commonly suffer from systematic measurement errors, which would result in
a non-zero response in free space. The in-phase response is typically strongly
correlated to subsurface magnetic susceptibility. Considering common
applications on weakly to moderately susceptible grounds, the in-phase
component of the secondary field is usually weaker than the quadrature
component, making it relatively more prone to systematic errors. Incorporating
coil-specific offset parameters in a probabilistic inversion framework, we show
how systematic errors in FDEM measurements can be estimated jointly with
electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. Including FDEM
measurements from more than one height, the offset estimate becomes closer to
the true offset, allowing an improved inversion result for the subsurface
magnetic susceptibility.

Antagonistic emotions, which is the typical psychological state of agents in

and the way they spread through contagion in a crowd are important causes of
crowd antagonistic behaviors. Moreover, games, which refers to the interaction
between opposing groups adopting different strategies to obtain higher benefits

antagonistic crowd simulation model, ACSEE, which is integrated with
antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories. Our approach
models the antagonistic emotions between agents in different roles using two
components: mental emotion and external emotion. We combine enhanced
susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and game approaches to evaluate the
role of antagonistic emotional contagion in crowd violence. Our evolutionary
game theoretic approach incorporates antagonistic emotional contagion through
deterrent force, which is modelled by a mixture of emotional forces and
physical forces defeating the opponents. Antagonistic emotional contagion and
evolutionary game theories influence each other to determine antagonistic crowd
behaviors. We evaluate our approach on real-world scenarios consisting of
different kinds of agents. We also compare the simulated crowd behaviors with
real-world crowd videos and use our approach to predict the trends of crowd
movements in violence incidents. We investigate the impact of various factors

improvements in safety, energy efficiency, and time utilization. However, their
net effect on energy and environmental outcomes is unclear. Higher fuel economy
reduces the energy required per mile of travel, but it also reduces the fuel
cost of travel, incentivizing more travel and causing an energy ""rebound
effect."" Moreover, CAVs are predicted to vastly reduce the time cost of travel,
inducing further increases in travel and energy use. In this paper, we forecast
the induced travel and rebound from CAVs using data on existing travel
behavior. We develop a microeconomic model of vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
choice under income and time constraints; then we use it to estimate
elasticities of VMT demand with respect to fuel and time costs, with fuel cost
data from the 2017 United States National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and
wage-derived predictions of travel time cost. Our central estimate of the
combined price elasticity of VMT demand is -0.4, which differs substantially
from previous estimates. We also find evidence that wealthier households have
more elastic demand, and that households at all income levels are more
sensitive to time costs than to fuel costs. We use our estimated elasticities
to simulate VMT and energy use impacts of full, private CAV adoption under a
range of possible changes to the fuel and time costs of travel. We forecast a
2-47% increase in travel demand for an average household. Our results indicate
that backfire - i.e., a net rise in energy use - is a possibility, especially
in higher income groups. This presents a stiff challenge to policy goals for
reductions in not only energy use but also traffic congestion and local and
global air pollution, as CAV use increases.

Banach space of geometrically decaying Fourier coefficients, a
Newton-Kantorovich theorem is applied to obtain the (computer-assisted) proofs
of existence. The required analytic estimates to verify the contractibility of
the operator are presented in full generality and symmetries from the model are
used to reduce the size of the problem to be solved. As applications, we
present proofs of existence of spontaneous periodic orbits in the Navier-Stokes
equations with Taylor-Green forcing.

(RAN) of next-generation (5G) wireless systems are ushering in a vision where
applications and services are physically decoupled from devices and network
infrastructure. This crucial aspect will ultimately enable the dynamic
deployment of heterogeneous services by different network operators over the
same physical infrastructure. RAN slicing is a form of 5G virtualization that
allows network infrastructure owners to dynamically ""slice"" and ""serve"" their
network resources (i.e., spectrum, power, antennas, among others) to different
mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), according to their current needs.
Once the slicing policy (i.e., the percentage of resources assigned to each
MVNO) has been computed, a major challenge is how to allocate spectrum
resources to MVNOs in such a way that (i) the slicing policy defined by the
network owner is enforced; and (ii) the interference among different MVNOs is
minimized. In this article, we mathematically formalize the RAN slicing
enforcement problem (RSEP) and demonstrate its NP-hardness. For this reason, we
design three approximation algorithms that render the solution scalable as the
RSEP increases in size. We extensively evaluate their performance through
simulations and experiments on a testbed made up of 8 software-defined radio
peripherals. Experimental results reveal that not only do our algorithms
enforce the slicing policies, but can also double the total network throughput

on the causal structure of spacetime. It models each spacetime configuration as

for the recovery of spatial geometry from discrete causal structure, the
construction of a spatial distance function for causal sets is reviewed.
Secondly, it is an open question whether the path sum over all causal sets
gives rise to an expectation value for the causal set that corresponds to a
cosmologically viable spacetime. To provide a tool to tackle the path sum over
causal sets, the derivation of a flow equation for the effective action for
causal sets in matrix-model language is reviewed. This could provide a way to
coarse-grain discrete networks in a background-independent way. Finally, a
short roadmap to test the asymptotic-safety conjecture in Lorentzian quantum

Eigenvalues in the pseudo-continuous spectrum however, converge to the
imaginary axis. We show that after rescaling, the pseudo-continuous spectrum
exhibits a hierarchical structure corresponding to the time-scales
$\tau_{1},\tau_{2},\ldots,\tau_{n}.$ Each level of this hierarchy is
approximated by spectral manifolds that can be easily computed. The set of
spectral manifolds comprises the so-called asymptotic continuous spectrum. It
is shown that the position of the asymptotic strong spectrum and asymptotic
continuous spectrum with respect to the imaginary axis completely determines
stability. In particular, a generic destabilization is mediated by the crossing
of an $n$-dimensional spectral manifold corresponding to the timescale
$\tau_{n}$.

ignoring their inter-dependencies. In this work, we study the effect of
relaxing these two assumptions. First, by characterizing a closed-form formula
for the Hessian matrix of a deep ReLU network, we prove that, for a

empirical experiments on ImageNet samples are consistent with our theory. This
result can have implications in other related problems such as adversarial

the $L_0-L_1$ relaxation technique along with the proximal gradient descent to
have an efficient computation of group feature importance scores. Our empirical
results indicate that considering group features can improve deep learning

unconstrained optimization. In terms of computational complexity, we show how
variants of the algorithm can recover continuous-variable Grover search, and
how a single iteration can replicate continuous-variable instantaneous quantum

consequence, the charges created by light illumination provoke two important

of several learning tasks such as generative models, domain adaptation,
clustering, etc. In this work, we focus on mixture distributions that arise
naturally in several application domains where the data contains different
sub-populations. For mixture distributions, established distance measures such
as the Wasserstein distance do not take into account imbalanced mixture
proportions. Thus, even if two mixture distributions have identical mixture
components but different mixture proportions, the Wasserstein distance between
them will be large. This often leads to undesired results in distance-based
learning methods for mixture distributions. In this paper, we resolve this
issue by introducing the Normalized Wasserstein measure. The key idea is to
introduce mixture proportions as optimization variables, effectively
normalizing mixture proportions in the Wasserstein formulation. Using the
proposed normalized Wasserstein measure leads to significant performance gains
for mixture distributions with imbalanced mixture proportions compared to the
vanilla Wasserstein distance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
measure in GANs, domain adaptation and adversarial clustering in several
benchmark datasets.

consequence, the energy gap between the vertex types can be partially modified
by varying the geometrical parameters of the nanomagnets, such as their width
and thickness. Based on the energy levels given by the micromagnetic
simulations, we compute the thermodynamic properties of the corresponding spin
models using Monte Carlo simulations. We found two regimes, both being
characterized by an extensive ground state manifold, in sharp contrast with
similar lattices with disconnected nanomagnets. For narrow and thin
nanomagnets, low-energy spin configurations consist of independent
ferromagnetic straight lines crossing the whole lattice. The ground state
manifold is thus highly degenerate, although this degeneracy is subdominant. In
the limit of thick and wide nanomagnets, our findings suggest that the

and its analysis can reveal fundamental parameters such as metallicity, age and
star formation history. Widely used methods to analyze these spectra are based
on comparing the galaxy spectra to stellar population (SP) models. Despite
being a powerful tool, SP models contain many ingredients, each with their
assumptions and uncertainties. Among the several possible sources of
uncertainties, it is not straightforward to identify which ingredient dominates
the errors in the models. In this work we propose a study of one of the SP
model ingredients -- the spectral stellar libraries -- independently of the
other ingredients. To that aim, we will use the integrated spectra of globular
clusters which have color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) available. From these CMDs
it is possible to model the integrated spectra of these objects without having
to adopt -- or make assumptions -- on the other two main ingredients of SP
models, evolutionary tracks or an IMF. Here we tested four widely used stellar
libraries. We found that the libraries are able to reproduce the integrated
spectra of 18 of the 30 cluster spectra inside a mean flux uncertainty of 5%.
For the larger wavelength range tested, a theoretical library outperforms the
empirical ones in the comparison. Without the blue part of the spectra,
empirical libraries fare better than the theoretical, in particular when
individual features are concerned. However, the results are promising for
theoretical libraries, which are equally efficient to reproduce the whole

  Approximation Method","12 pages, 5 figures, Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Power Systems
  on January 27, 2019. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1810.08156",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a novel non-intrusive probabilistic power flow (PPF) analysis
method based on the low-rank approximation (LRA) is proposed, which can
accurately and efficiently estimate the probabilistic characteristics (e.g.,
mean, variance, probability density function) of the PPF solutions. This method
aims at building up a statistically-equivalent surrogate for the PPF solutions
through a small number of power flow evaluations. By exploiting the retained
tensor-product form of the univariate polynomial basis, a sequential
correction-updating scheme is applied, making the total number of unknowns to
be linear rather than exponential to the number of random inputs. Consequently,
the LRA method is particularly promising for dealing with high-dimensional
problems with a large number of random inputs. Numerical studies on the IEEE
39-bus, 118-bus, and 1354-bus systems show that the proposed method can achieve
accurate probabilistic characteristics of the PPF solutions with much less
computational effort compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Even compared to
the polynomial chaos expansion method, the LRA method can achieve comparable
accuracy, while the LRA method is more capable of handling higher-dimensional
problems. Moreover, numerical results reveal that the randomness brought about
by the renewable energy resources and loads may inevitably affect the
feasibility of dispatch/planning schemes.

  Attacks","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1809.09262",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial attacks add perturbations to the input features with the intent
of changing the classification produced by a machine learning system. Small
perturbations can yield adversarial examples which are misclassified despite
being virtually indistinguishable from the unperturbed input. Classifiers
trained with standard neural network techniques are highly susceptible to
adversarial examples, allowing an adversary to create misclassifications of
their choice.
  We introduce a new type of network unit, called MWD (max of weighed distance)
units that have a built-in resistant to adversarial attacks. These units are
highly non-linear, and we develop the techniques needed to effectively train
them. We show that simple interval techniques for propagating perturbation
effects through the network enables the efficient computation of robustness
(i.e., accuracy guarantees) for MWD networks under any perturbations, including
adversarial attacks.
  MWD networks are significantly more robust to input perturbations than ReLU
networks. On permutation invariant MNIST, when test examples can be perturbed
by 20% of the input range, MWD networks provably retain accuracy above 83%,
while the accuracy of ReLU networks drops below 5%. The provable accuracy of
MWD networks is superior even to the observed accuracy of ReLU networks trained
with the help of adversarial examples. In the absence of adversarial attacks,
MWD networks match the performance of sigmoid networks, and have accuracy only
slightly below that of ReLU networks.

particle identification via time-of-flight determination with about 20~ps

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1712.07793",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a compositional approach for the construction of
finite abstractions (a.k.a. finite Markov decision processes (MDPs)) for
networks of discrete-time stochastic control subsystems that are not
necessarily stabilizable. The proposed approach leverages the interconnection
topology and a notion of finite-step stochastic storage functions, that
describes joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems and their
abstractions, and establishes a finite-step stochastic simulation function as a
relation between the network and its abstraction. To this end, we first develop
a new type of compositionality conditions which is less conservative than the
existing ones. In particular, using a relaxation via a finite-step stochastic
simulation function, it is possible to construct finite abstractions such that
stabilizability of each subsystem is not necessarily required. We then propose
an approach to construct finite MDPs together with their corresponding
finite-step storage functions for general discrete-time stochastic control
systems satisfying an incremental passivablity property. We also construct
finite MDPs for a particular class of nonlinear stochastic control systems. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results, we apply our results on
three different case studies.

arbitrary ergodic finite-state Markov chain from a single trajectory of length
$m$. The reversible case was addressed by Hsu et al. [2019], who left the
general case as an open problem. In the reversible case, the analysis is
greatly facilitated by the fact that the Markov operator is self-adjoint, and
Weyl's inequality allows for a dimension-free perturbation analysis of the
empirical eigenvalues. As Hsu et al. point out, in the absence of reversibility
(which induces asymmetric pair probabilities matrices), the existing
perturbation analysis has a worst-case exponential dependence on the number of
states $d$. Furthermore, even if an eigenvalue perturbation analysis with
better dependence on $d$ were available, in the non-reversible case the
connection between the spectral gap and the mixing time is not nearly as
straightforward as in the reversible case. Our key insight is to estimate the
pseudo-spectral gap $\gamma_{\mathsf{ps}}$ instead, which allows us to overcome
the loss of symmetry and to achieve a polynomial dependence on the minimal
stationary probability $\pi_\star$ and $\gamma_{\mathsf{ps}}$. Additionally, in
the reversible case, we obtain simultaneous nearly (up to logarithmic factors)
minimax rates in $t_{\mathsf{mix}}$ and precision $\varepsilon$, closing a gap
in Hsu et al., who treated $\varepsilon$ as constant in the lower bounds.
Finally, we construct fully empirical confidence intervals for
$\gamma_{\mathsf{ps}}$, which shrink to zero at a rate of roughly $1/\sqrt{m}$,

tasks, their accuracy drops significantly in the presence of small adversarial
perturbations to inputs. Defenses based on regularization and adversarial
training are often followed by new attacks to defeat them. In this paper, we
propose attack-agnostic robustness certificates for a multi-label
classification problem using a deep ReLU network. Although computing the exact
distance of a given input sample to the classification decision boundary
requires solving a non-convex optimization, we characterize two lower bounds
for such distances, namely the simplex certificate and the decision boundary
certificate. These robustness certificates leverage the piece-wise linear
structure of ReLU networks and use the fact that in a polyhedron around a given
sample, the prediction function is linear. In particular, the proposed simplex
certificate has a closed-form, is differentiable and is an order of magnitude
faster to compute than the existing methods even for deep networks. In addition
to theoretical bounds, we provide numerical results for our certificates over
MNIST and compare them with some existing upper bounds.

introspective analyses of rhythm as a correlate of syllable and foot timing in

physical oscillations. The present study avoids introspection and
human-filtered annotation methods and extends the signal processing paradigm of
amplitude envelope spectrum analysis by adding an additional analytic step of
edge detection, and postulating the co-existence of multiple speech rhythms in

exploratory investigation of the utility of RZT is conducted, suggesting that
native and non-native readings of the same text are distinct sub-genres of read
speech: a reading by a US native speaker and non-native readings by relatively
low-performing Cantonese adult learners of English. The study concludes by
noting that with the methods used, RZT can distinguish between the speech
rhythms of well-defined sub-genres of native speaker reading vs. non-native
learner reading, but needs further refinement in order to be applied to the
paradoxically more complex speech of low-performing language learners, whose
speech rhythms are co-determined by non-fluency and disfluency factors in

equilibrium points in the model, damage, loss or income functions of the
objects of which are described by convex functions. Such models can be found in
medicine, economics, game theory, and biology. Knowledge of the equilibrium
points is important for our life, since all complex structures, such as any
highly developed living organism, our society and also multi-competitive
organizations in economics, biology and game theory strive for them. To reduce
a more complicated case with nonsmooth functions describing the state of each
element of the system as damage, loss, or profit, to a case with smooth
functions the Steklov average integrals are used that turn nonsmooth functions
into smooth ones, for which previously developed numerical methods can be used
for finding equilibrium points. During the process of optimization, the
diameters of the sets over which the averaging takes place are decreased. The
numerical methods for finding the equilibrium points in the more general
non-smooth case are constructed. The convergence of all limit points to the
equilibrium points is proved. It is concluded that it is necessary to apply new
methods for finding Nash equilibrium points in the nonsmooth case, as well as
to obtain the set of all such points in order to analyze it and select the most
optimal solutions.

storage. The gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellite mission
provided a valuable independent data source for tracking TWS at regional and

hydrological models to improve their predictive performance. Here we develop
and apply deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to learn the
spatiotemporal patterns of mismatch between TWS anomalies (TWSA) derived from
GRACE and those simulated by NOAH, a widely used land surface model. Once
trained, our CNN models can be used to correct the NOAH simulated TWSA without
requiring GRACE data, potentially filling the data gap between GRACE and its
follow-on mission, GRACE-FO. Our methodology is demonstrated over India, which
has experienced significant groundwater depletion in recent decades that is
nevertheless not being captured by the NOAH model. Results show that the CNN
models significantly improve the match with GRACE TWSA, achieving a
country-average correlation coefficient of 0.94 and Nash-Sutcliff efficient of
0.87, or 14\% and 52\% improvement respectively over the original NOAH TWSA. At
the local scale, the learned mismatch pattern correlates well with the observed
in situ groundwater storage anomaly data for most parts of India, suggesting
that deep learning models effectively compensate for the missing groundwater

system, which has received more attention recently, due to increasing growth in
the e-commerce sector. Instead of sending pickers to the inventory area to
search for and pick the ordered items, robots carry shelves (called ""pods"")
including ordered items from the inventory area to picking stations. In the
picking stations, human pickers put ordered items into totes; then these items
are transported by a conveyor to the packing stations. This type of warehousing
system relieves the human pickers and improves the picking process. In this
paper, we concentrate on decisions about the assignment of pods to stations and
orders to stations to fulfill picking for each incoming customer's order. In
previous research for an RMFS with multiple picking stations, these decisions
are made sequentially. Instead, we present a new integrated model. To improve
the system performance even more, we extend our model by splitting orders. This
means parts of an order are allowed to be picked at different stations. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first publication on split orders
in an RMFS. We analyze different performance metrics, such as pile-on,
pod-station visits, robot moving distance and order turn-over time. We compare
the results of our models in different instances with the sequential method in
our open-source simulation framework RAWSim-O.

optimization of the solar energy is undertaken by subject matter experts using

based on the B\'ezier extraction and the $C^0$-type higher-order shear
deformation theory ($C^0$-HSDT). By applying the B\'ezier extraction, the
original Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) control meshes can be
transformed into the B\'ezier elements which allow us to inherit the standard
numerical procedure like the finite element method (FEM). The mechanical
displacement field is approximated based on the $C^0$-HSDT whilst the electric
potential is assumed to be a linear function through the thickness of each
piezoelectric sublayer. The FG plate contains the internal pores and GPLs
dispersed in the metal matrix either uniformly or non-uniformly according to
various different patterns along the thickness of plate. In addition, to
control dynamic responses, two piezoelectric layers are perfectly bonded on the
top and bottom surfaces of the FG plate. The geometrically nonlinear equations
are solved by the Newton-Raphson iterative procedure and the Newmark's time
integration scheme. The influences of the porosity coefficients, weight
fractions of GPLs as well as the external electrical voltage on the
geometrically nonlinear behaviours of the plates with different porosity
distributions and GPL dispersion patterns are evidently investigated through
numerical examples. Then, a constant displacement and velocity feedback control
approaches are adopted to active control the geometrically nonlinear static as
well as the dynamic responses of the FG porous plates, where the effect of the
structural damping is considered, based on a closed-loop control with
piezoelectric sensors and actuators.

worlds. Photons are discrete energy packets only at the moment of emission;
then they evolve diffractively and propagate as classical waves. We apply IPMT

NIW. NIW was recognized by Huygens when postulating his secondary spherical

causal and working mathematical equations, along with NIW in interferometric
experiments, reveal that Superposition Effects can emerge only when the
interacting material dipoles respond, whether classically or quantum
mechanically, to the joint stimulations due to all the simultaneously
superposed waves. This indicates the non-causality of our belief that a single
indivisible photon can interfere by itself. We would not have a causally
evolving universe had any stable elementary particle were to change itself
