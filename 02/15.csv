exhibit the butterfly effect: a minute change in initial conditions can soon
have exponentially large effects elsewhere. But this phenomenon is difficult to
reconcile with quantum mechanics. One of the main goals in the field of quantum
chaos is to establish a correspondence between the dynamics of classical
chaotic systems and their quantum counterparts. In isolated systems in the
absence of decoherence, there is such a correspondence in dynamics, but it
usually persists only over a short time window, after which quantum
interference washes out classical chaos. We demonstrate that quantum mechanics
can also play the opposite role and generate exponential instabilities in
classically non-chaotic systems within this early-time window. Our calculations
employ the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) -- a diagnostic that reduces
to the Lyapunov exponent in the classical limit, but is well defined for
general quantum systems. Specifically, we show that a variety of classically
non-chaotic models, such as polygonal billiards, whose classical Lyapunov
exponents are always zero, demonstrate a Lyapunov-like exponential growth of
the OTOC at early times with Planck's-constant-dependent rates. This behavior
is sharply contrasted with the slow early-time growth of the analog of the OTOC
in the systems' classical counterparts. These results suggest that
classical-to-quantum correspondence in dynamics is violated in the OTOC even
before quantum interference develops.

astronomical sources with respect to their cosmic time are important l
phenomena that can provide valuable information about the dynamics within the

applying linear analysis to understand and model quasars' light curves. Here,
we study the multifractal behavior of selected quasars' radio emissions in
their observed frame (at 22 and 37 GHz bands) and and their rest frame. To this
end, we apply the wavelet transform-based multifractal analysis formalism
called wavelet transform modulus maxima. In addition, we verify whether the
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models fit our data or not. In
our work, we observe strong multifractal behavior for all the sources.
Additionally, we find that the degree of multifractality is strongly similar
for each source and significantly different between sources at 22 and 37 GHz.
This similarity implies that the two frequencies have the same radiation region
and mechanism, whereas the difference indicates that the sources have
intrinsically different dynamics. Furthermore, we show that the degree of
multifractality is the same in the observed and rest frames of the quasars,
i.e., multifractality is an intrinsic property of radio quasars. Finally, we
show that the ARIMA models fit the 3C 345 quasar at 22 GHz and partially fit
most of the time series with the exception of the 3C 273 and 3C 279 quasars at
37 GHz, for which the models are found to be inadequate.

confirming the previous assignment of $dd$ and spin excitations (magnon,

where the s-wave scattering is the only low energy constant at play. Many-Body
Perturbative approach that is usually valid at rather low density is first
discussed. We then use the resummation technique with the ladder approximation
to obtain compact expressions for both the energy and/or the on-shell
self-energy in infinite spin-degenerated systems. Diagrammatic resummation
technique has the advantage in general to be predictive in a region of density
larger compared to many-body perturbation theory. It also leads to
non-diverging limit as $|a_s| \rightarrow + \infty$. Still, the obtained
expressions are rather complex functional of the Fermi momentum $k_F$. We
introduce the full phase-space average or the partial phase-space methods
respectively applied to the energy or to the self-energy to simplify their
dependences in terms of $(a_s k_F)$ while keeping the correct limit at low
density and the non-diverging property at large $|a_s k_F|$. Quasi-particle
properties of Fermi system in various regime of density and scattering length
are then illustrated. Our conclusion is that such simplified expressions where
the direct link is made with the low energy constant without fine-tuning can
provide a clear guidance to obtain density functional theory beyond the
perturbative regime. However, quasi-particle properties close or near unitary
cannot be reproduced unless this limit is explicitly used as a constraint. We
finally discuss how such approximate treatment of quasi-particle can guide the
development of density functional theory for strongly interacting Fermi

persistence time $\tau_p$ and high P\'eclet number, exhibits remarkable
behaviour at high densities. As $\tau_p\to 0$, the assembly undergoes a gradual
slowing down of density relaxations, as one reduces the active propulsion force
$f$, until at the glass transition, the relaxation times diverge. In the other
limit, $\tau_p \to \infty$, the fluid jams on lowering $f$, at a critical
threshold $f^*(\infty)$, with stresses concentrated along force-chains. As one
moves away from this jamming threshold, the force-chains dynamically remodel,
and the lifetime of the force-balanced configurations diverges as one
approaches $f^*(\infty)$, by tuning $\tau_p$. In between these limits, the
approach to dynamical arrest at low $f$, goes through a phase characterised by
intermittency in the kinetic energy. This intermittency is a consequence of
long periods of jamming followed by bursts of plastic yielding associated with
Eshelby deformations, akin to the response of dense amorphous solids to an
externally imposed shear. The frequency of these plastic bursts increases as
one moves towards the intermittent phase-fluid boundary, where the correlated
plastic events result in large scale vorticity and turbulence. Dense extreme

complex tasks is still a challenging problem. Open-ended evolution of complex
robot behaviors can be a possible solution whereby an intrinsic driver for
pattern formation and self-organization may prove to be important. We implement
such a driver in collective robot systems by evolving prediction networks as
world models in pair with action-selection networks. Fitness is given for good
predictions which causes a bias towards easily predictable environments and
behaviors in the form of emergent patterns, that is, environments of minimal
surprise. There is no task-dependent bias or any other explicit
predetermination for the different qualities of the emerging patterns. A
careful configuration of actions, sensor models, and the environment is
required to stimulate the emergence of complex behaviors. We study
self-assembly to increase the scenario's complexity for our minimal surprise
approach and, at the same time, limit the complexity of our simulations to a
grid world to manage the feasibility of this approach. We investigate the
impact of different swarm densities and the shape of the environment on the
emergent patterns. Furthermore, we study how evolution can be biased towards
the emergence of desired patterns. We analyze the resilience of the resulting
self-assembly behaviors by causing damages to the assembled pattern and observe
the self-organized reassembly of the structure. In summary, we evolved swarm
behaviors for resilient self-assembly and successfully engineered
self-organization in simulation. In future work, we plan to transfer our
approach to a swarm of real robots.

Though
many methods have been proposed, it still remains an open question how to

state-of-the-art works train action classifiers on video segments
pre-determined by action proposal. However, recent work found that a desirable
model should move beyond segment-level and make dense predictions at a fine
granularity in time to determine precise temporal boundaries. In this paper, we
propose a Frame Segmentation Network (FSN) that places a temporal CNN on top of
the 2D spatial CNNs. Spatial CNNs are responsible for abstracting semantics in
spatial dimension while temporal CNN is responsible for introducing temporal
context information and performing dense predictions. The proposed FSN can make
dense predictions at frame-level for a video clip using both spatial and
temporal context information. FSN is trained in an end-to-end manner, so the
model can be optimized in spatial and temporal domain jointly. We also adapt
FSN to use it in weakly supervised scenario (WFSN), where only video level
labels are provided when training. Experiment results on public dataset show
that FSN achieves superior performance in both frame-level action localization

electrical control of magnetization. A quintessential example of SOI-induced
transport is the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), first observed in 1880, in which
an electric current perpendicular to the magnetization in a magnetic film
generates charge accumulation on the surfaces. Here we report the observation
of a counterpart of the AHE that we term the anomalous spin-orbit torque
(ASOT), wherein an electric current parallel to the magnetization generates
opposite spin-orbit torques on the surfaces of the magnetic film. We interpret
the ASOT as due to a spin-Hall-like current generated with an efficiency of
0.053+/-0.003 in Ni80Fe20, comparable to the spin Hall angle of Pt. Similar
effects are also observed in other common ferromagnetic metals, including Co,
Ni, and Fe. First principles calculations corroborate the order of magnitude of
the measured values. This work suggests that a strong spin current with spin
polarization transverse to magnetization can exist in a ferromagnet, despite
spin dephasing. It challenges the current understanding of spin-orbit torque in

a lack of blue objects, and a small intrinsic scatter in stellar mass at fixed

Yet, both have time-varying and unpredictable dynamics and are challenging to

the stability analysis is to assume passive user and environment, and to
control the master-communications-slave system to be passive as well. This
paper circumvents the need to model the user and environment in a novel way: it
regards their forces as external excitations for a semi-autonomous force

injection controller that renders bilateral teleoperation with time-varying
delays exponentially input-to-state stable. The controller uses the position

associated with a crossover into a regime of coherent quasiparticles with
strong orbital differentiation of the inelastic scattering rates. The eventual

However, to date no scalable methodology for gaining electrical access to

viable edge contact formation to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulated

smooth hBN environment also preserves the intrinsic MoS$_2$ channel quality
during fabrication, leading to a steep subthreshold swing of 116 mV/dec with a
negligible hysteresis. Hence, edge contacts are highly promising for
large-scale practical implementation of encapsulated heterostructure devices,
especially those involving air sensitive materials, and can be arbitrarily
narrow, which opens the door to further shrinkage of 2D device footprint.

advocated in view of neutrino oscillation anomalies. This extra state would
contribute to the tritium decay spectrum, and its properties, mass and mixing

at redshift $z = 0.94$ in a strongly lensed arc behind a Hubble Frontier Field
galaxy cluster, MACS J0416.1-2403, discovered as part of a systematic archival
search. The bright transient (dubbed ""Warhol"") was discovered in Hubble Space
Telescope data taken on 2014 September 15 and 16. This single image faded over
a period of two weeks, and observations taken on 2014 September 1 show that the
duration of the microlensing event was at most four weeks in total. The light
curve may also exhibit slow changes over a period of years consistent with the
level of microlensing expected from stars responsible for the intracluster
light (ICL) of the cluster. Optical and infrared observations taken near peak
brightness can be fit by a stellar spectrum with moderate host-galaxy
extinction. A blue supergiant matches the measured spectral energy distribution
near peak, implying a temporary magnification of at least several thousand.
While the spectrum of an O-type star would also fit the transient's spectral
energy distribution, extremely luminous O-type stars are much less common than
blue supergiants. The short timescale of the event and the estimated effective
temperature indicate that the lensed source is an extremely magnified star.

increase the level of dopamine in the brain (including, but not limited to,
nicotine) also increase feelings of wakefulness. Diseases that are
characterized by low dopamine levels, like Parkinson's disease, also are
related to sleep disorders.
  In this work we investigate the influence that nicotine and alcohol exert on
sleep, modeling the coupling of reward and thalamocortical circuits in a
reward-attention circuit. Computer simulations of the circuit reflect the
spiking behavior of neurons in the network under the presence or absence of
nicotine or alcohol.
  Each neuron in the reward-attention model represents a population of cells in
the circuit, and is described by a coupled system of nonlinear differential
equations that replicates essential neurophysiological properties of the
population. The computational simulations highlight aspects of clinical
insomnia symptoms in Parkinson's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder and autism spectrum disorder.
  Our results imply that nicotine can disrupt sleep, promoting wakefulness. In
contrast, alcohol increases sleep latency (time to fall asleep). Also, the
simulations suggest that alcohol has a sedative effect in people with insomnia.

the progress of understanding the role of decoherence. In order to fulfill its
promise as a realistic description of the physical world, two postulates are
formulated. In short they are 1) for a system with continuous coordinates
$\vec{x}$, discrete variable $j$, and state $\psi_j(\vec{x})$, the density
$\rho_j(\vec{x})=|\psi_j(\vec{x})|^2$ gives the distribution of the location of
the system with the respect to the variables $\vec{x}$ and $j$; 2) an equation
of motion for the state $i\hbar \partial_t \psi = H\psi$. The first postulate
connects the mathematical description to the physical reality, which has been
missing in previous versions. The contents of the standard (Copenhagen)
postulates are derived, including the appearance of Hilbert space and the Born
rule. The approach to probabilities earlier proposed by Greaves replaces the

which is designed to produce synthetic observations from simulated clusters.
The code can synthesise observations from both ground- and spaced-based
observatories, for a range of different filters, observational conditions and
angular/spectral resolution. In this paper, we highlight some of the features
of MYOSOTIS, creating synthetic observations from young massive star clusters.
Our model clusters are simulated using nbody6 code and have different total
masses, half-mass radii, and binary fractions. The synthetic observations are
made at the age of 2 Myr with Solar metallicity and under different extinction
conditions. For each cluster, we create synthetic images of the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) in the visible (WFPC2/F555W) as well as Very Large Telescopes
(VLT) in the nearIR (SPHERE/IRDIS/Ks). We show how MYOSOTIS can be used to look
at mass function (MF) determinations. For this aim we re-estimate stellar
masses using a photometric analysis on the synthetic images. The synthetic MF
slopes are compared to their actual values. Our photometric analysis
demonstrate that depending on the adopted filter, extinction, angular
resolution and pixel sampling of the instruments, the power-law index of the
underlying MFs can be shallower than the observed ones by at least 0.25 dex
which is in agreement with the observed discrepancies reported in the
literature, specially for young star clusters.

have been successfully applied to account for the EM spectral variability.
However, these models still lack the compromise between flexibility and
low-dimensional representation that is necessary to properly explore the fact
that spectral variability is often confined to a low-dimensional manifold in
real scenes. In this paper we propose to learn a spectral variability model
directly form the observed data, instead of imposing it \emph{a priori}. This
is achieved through a deep generative EM model, which is estimated using a
variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder and decoder that compose the
generative model are trained using pure pixel information extracted directly
from the observed image, what allows for an unsupervised formulation. The
proposed EM model is applied to the solution of a spectral unmixing problem,
which we cast as an alternating nonlinear least-squares problem that is solved
iteratively with respect to the abundances and to the low-dimensional
representations of the EMs in the latent space of the deep generative model.
Simulations using both synthetic and real data indicate that the proposed
strategy can outperform the competing state-of-the-art algorithms.

coefficients of electrons in pure xenon gas and in xenon-helium gas mixtures at
1-9 bar and electric field strengths of 50-300 V/cm. In pure xenon we find
excellent agreement with world data at all $E/P$, for both drift velocity and
diffusion coefficients. However, a larger value of the longitudinal diffusion
coefficient than theoretical predictions is found at low $E/P$ in pure xenon,
below the range of reduced fields usually probed by TPC experiments. A similar
effect is observed in xenon-helium gas mixtures at somewhat larger $E/P$. Drift
velocities in xenon-helium mixtures are found to be theoretically well
predicted. Although longitudinal diffusion in xenon-helium mixtures is found to
be larger than anticipated, extrapolation based on the measured longitudinal
diffusion coefficients suggest that the use of helium additives to reduce
transverse diffusion in xenon gas remains a promising prospect.

alignment between the radio jet and the associated rotation axis of the sub-pc

this alignment has not yet been checked in a sufficient number of Low
Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs). The project intends to examine the
validity of this paradigm by measuring the radio continuum on the same physical
scale as the accretion disks, to investigate any possible connection between
these disks and the radio continuum. We observed a sample of 18 LLAGNs in the
4.8 GHz (6 cm) radio continuum using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) with
3.3 to 6.5 milliarcseconds resolution. The sources were selected to show both
an edge-on accretion disk revealed by 22 GHz H$_{2}$O megamaser emission and
signatures of a radio jet. Furthermore, the sources were previously detected in
33GHz radio continuum observations made with the Very Large Array. Five out of
18 galaxies observed were detected at 8 sigma or higher levels (Mrk0001,
Mrk1210, Mrk1419, NGC2273 and UGC3193). While all these sources are known to
have maser disks, four of these five sources exhibit a maser disk with known
orientation. For all four sources, the radio continuum is misaligned relative
to the rotation axis of the maser disk, but with a 99.1% confidence level, the
orientations are not random and are confined to a cone within 32 degree of the
maser disk's normal. Among the four sources the misalignment of the radio
continuum with respect to the normal vector to the maser disk is smaller when
the inner radius of the maser disk is larger. Furthermore, a correlation is
observed between the 5 GHz VLBA radio continuum and the [OIII] luminosity and
also with the H$_{2}$O maser disk's inner radius.

existing complex agent (e.g., a robotic arm), which they learn to control. In
contrast, this paper investigates a modular co-evolution strategy: a collection
of primitive agents learns to dynamically self-assemble into composite bodies
while also learning to coordinate their behavior to control these bodies. Each
primitive agent consists of a limb with a motor attached at one end. Limbs may
choose to link up to form collectives. When a limb initiates a link-up action,
and there is another limb nearby, the latter is magnetically connected to the
'parent' limb's motor. This forms a new single agent, which may further link
with other agents. In this way, complex morphologies can emerge, controlled by
a policy whose architecture is in explicit correspondence with the morphology.
We evaluate the performance of these dynamic and modular agents in simulated
environments. We demonstrate better generalization to test-time changes both in
the environment, as well as in the structure of the agent, compared to static
and monolithic baselines. Project video and code are available at

formation: TNG50, the third and final installment of the IllustrisTNG project.
TNG50 evolves 2x2160^3 dark-matter particles and gas cells in a volume 50
comoving Mpc across. It hence reaches a numerical resolution typical of zoom-in
simulations, with a baryonic element mass of 8.5x10^4 Msun and an average cell
size of 70-140 parsecs in the star-forming regions of galaxies. Simultaneously,
TNG50 samples ~700 (6,500) galaxies with stellar masses above 10^10 (10^8) Msun
at z=1. Here we investigate the structural and kinematical evolution of
star-forming galaxies across cosmic time (0 < z < 6). We quantify their sizes,
disk heights, 3D shapes, and degree of rotational vs. dispersion-supported
motions as traced by rest-frame V-band light (i.e. roughly stellar mass) and by
Halpha light (i.e. star-forming and dense gas). The unprecedented resolution of
TNG50 enables us to model galaxies with sub-kpc half-light radii and with
<300-pc disk heights. Coupled with the large-volume statistics, we characterize
a diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical
morphological mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs. Our model predicts
that for star-forming galaxies the fraction of disk-like morphologies, based on
3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass. Gas
kinematics reveal that the vast majority of 10^9-11.5 Msun star-forming
galaxies are rotationally-supported disks for most cosmic epochs
(Vmax/sigma>2-3, z<5), being dynamically hotter at earlier epochs (z>1.5).
Despite large velocity dispersion at high redshift, cold and dense gas in
galaxies predominantly arranges in disky or elongated shapes at all times and
masses; these gaseous components exhibit rotationally-dominated motions far
exceeding the collisionless stellar bodies.

spatial resolution of star-forming ISM gas is ~100-140 parsecs. This resolution
approaches or exceeds that of modern 'zoom' simulations of individual massive
galaxies, while the volume contains ~20,000 resolved galaxies with M*>10^7
Msun. Herein we show first results from TNG50, focusing on galactic outflows
driven by supernovae as well as supermassive black hole feedback. We find that
the outflow mass loading is a non-monotonic function of galaxy stellar mass,
turning over and rising rapidly above 10^10.5 Msun due to the action of the
central black hole. Outflow velocity increases with stellar mass, and at fixed
mass is faster at higher redshift. The TNG model can produce high velocity,
multi-phase outflows which include cool, dense components. These outflows reach
speeds in excess of 3000 km/s out to 20 kpc with an ejective, BH-driven origin.
Critically, we show how the relative simplicity of model inputs (and scalings)
at the injection scale produces complex behavior at galactic and halo scales.
For example, despite isotropic wind launching, outflows exhibit natural
collimation and an emergent bipolarity. Furthermore, galaxies above the
star-forming main sequence drive faster outflows, although this correlation
inverts at high mass with the onset of quenching, whereby low luminosity,
slowly accreting, massive black holes drive the strongest outflows.

supergravity, in which the axionic structure originates from, and is protected
by, gauge symmetry in an extra dimension. While local supersymmetry (SUSY) is
necessarily Higgsed at high scales during inflation we show that it can
naturally survive down to the $\sim$ TeV scale in the current era in order to
resolve the electroweak hierarchy problem. We show how a suitable inflationary
effective potential for the axions can be generated at tree-level by charged
fields under the higher-dimensional gauge symmetry. The inflationary trajectory
lies along the lightest direction in the bi-axion field space, with periodic
effective potential and an effective super-Planckian field range emerging from
fundamentally sub-Planckian dynamics. The heavier direction in the field space
is shown to also play an important role, as the dominant source of
super-Higgsing during inflation. This model presents an interesting interplay
of tuning considerations relating the electroweak hierarchy, cosmological
constant and inflationary superpotential, where maximal naturalness favors SUSY
breaking near the electroweak scale after inflation. The scalar superpartner of
the axionic inflaton, the ""sinflaton"", can naturally have $\sim$ Hubble mass
during inflation and sufficiently strong coupling to the inflaton to mediate
primordial non-Gaussianities of observable strength in future 21-cm surveys.
Non-minimal charged fields under the higher-dimensional gauge symmetry can

early stages of it's evolution. In this paper we analyse the influence of the
thermal bath of Standard Model particles on the dynamics of cosmological Higgs
domain walls. This manuscript poses an~extension of our earlier work in which
we investigated the evolution of networks of Higgs domain walls neglecting the
impact of temperature variation.
  Using the thermally corrected effective potential of Standard Model we have
found that both the position of the local maximum $h_{max}$ separating minima
and the width of domain walls strongly depend on temperature $T$. For
temperatures higher than $10^{10}\; \textrm{GeV}$ they respectively increase
proportionally and decrease inverse proportionally to the increasing
temperature. Thus, the energy scale of the problem follows the value of
temperature.
  Our numerical lattice simulations based on the PRS algorithm reveal that
Higgs domain walls in the presence of the background thermal bath are highly
unstable and decay shortly after formation. Moreover we have found that the
fraction of horizons produced by inflation in which Higgs field expectation
value is higher then $h_{max}$ needs to be very low in order for the evolution
of the~network of the domain walls to end in the electroweak vacuum. This means
that Higgs domain walls necessarily were very rare objects and their average
energy density was very small. As a result, the domain walls can not
significantly effect cosmological observables.

properties of stars like the Sun. However, main-sequence F-type stars exhibit
short mode lifetimes relative to their oscillation frequency, resulting in
overlapping radial and quadrupole modes. The goal of this paper is to use the
blended modes for asteroseismology in place of the individual separable modes.
We used a peak-bagging method to measure the centroids of radial-quadrupole
pairs for 66 stars from the \textit{Kepler} LEGACY sample, as well as {\theta}
Cyg, HD 49933, HD 181420, and Procyon. We used the relative quadrupole-mode
visibility to estimate a theoretical centroid frequency from a grid of stellar
oscillation models. The observed centroids were matched to the modelled
centroids with empirical surface correction to calculate stellar parameters. We
find that the stellar parameters returned using this approach agree with the
results using individual mode frequencies for stars, where those are available.
We conclude that the unresolved centroid frequencies can be used to perform
asteroseismology with an accuracy similar to that based on individual mode
frequencies.

excitation by the magnetic field, which couples unnatural-parity states. Since
the M1 excitation occurs mainly for open-shell nuclei, the nuclear pairing
effect is expected to play a role. As expected from the form of operator, this
mode may provide the information on the spin-related properties, including the
spin component of dineutron and diproton correlations. In general, the sum rule
for M1 transition strength has not been derived yet. Purpose: To investigate
the M1 excitation of the systems with two valence nucleons above the
closed-shell core, with pairing correlation included, and to establish the M1
sum rule that could be used to validate theoretical and experimental
approaches. Possibility to utilize the M1 excitation as a tool to investigate
the pairing correlation in medium is also discussed. Method: Three-body model,
which consists of a rigid spherical core and two valence nucleons, is employed.
Interactions for its two-body subsystems are phenomenologically determined in
order to reproduce the two-body and three-body energies. We also derive the M1
sum rule within this three-body picture. Conclusion: The introduced M1 sum rule
can be utilized as a benchmark for model calculations of M1 transitions in the
systems with two valence nucleons. The total sum of the M1 transition strength
is related with the coupled spin of valence nucleons in the open shell, where
the pairing correlation is unnegligible. The three-body-model calculations for
18 O, 18 Ne, and 42 Ca nuclei demonstrate a significant effect of the pairing
correlations on the low-lying M1 transitions. Therefore, further experimental
studies of M1 transitions in those systems are on demand, in order to validate
proposed sum rule, provide a suitable probe for the nuclear pairing in medium,
as well as to optimize the pairing models.

the calculation of tunnelling profiles for cosmological phase transitions,

our approach to provide at least as accurate results as these dedicated

accurate and reliable solutions. In particular, we compare the neural network
approach with two publicly available profile solvers, \texttt{CosmoTransitions}

network approach finds the correct solution while dedicated solvers do not. We
point out that this approach of using artificial neural networks to solve

evolutionary patterns. G-HMMs allow for: near limitless behavioral variation;
imposing constraints on how individuals can evolve; different evolutionary
rates; and are parsimonious. Our experiments with Academic and StackExchange

researchers: $\textit{Steady}$, $\textit{Diverse, Evolving and Diffuse}$. We
observe clear differences in the evolution of male and female researchers
within the same archetype. Specifically, women and men differ within an
archetype (e.g. Diverse) in how they start, how they transition and the time
spent in mid-career. We also found that the differences in grant income are
better explained by the differences in archetype than by differences in gender.
For StackOverflow, discovered archetypes could be labeled as $\textit{Experts,
Seekers, Enthusiasts, and Facilitators}$. We have strong quantitative results

session prediction, the proposed G-HMM cluster model improves by an average of

incorporate anatomical priors to make contextual and non-local decisions that

reconstructions of larger spatial extent of existing white matter bundles,
promising reconstructions of less false positives, and promising robustness to
known position and shape biases of current tractography techniques. But as of
today, none of these ML-based methods have shown conclusive performances or
have been adopted as a de facto solution to tractography. One reason for this
might be the lack of well-defined and extensive frameworks to train, evaluate,

a different formation path. On the other hand, however, isolated fully-recycled

network in near real-time is a canonical problem. However, current tracking
platforms have two key limitations: 1) They are monolithic, proprietary and
lack the ability to rapidly incorporate sophisticated tracking models; and 2)
They are less responsive to dynamism across wide-area computing resources that
include edge, fog and cloud abstractions. We address these gaps using Anveshak,
a runtime platform for composing and coordinating distributed tracking
applications. It provides a domain-specific dataflow programming model to
intuitively compose a tracking application, supporting contemporary CV advances
like query fusion and re-identification, and enabling dynamic scoping of the

tunable batching and data-dropping strategies for dataflow blocks deployed on

balance the tracking accuracy, its real-time performance and the active

density. However, it is very sensitive to a length parameter that is inherent
to the Schr\""odinger equation. In addition, linking data points into clusters
requires local estimates of covariance that are also controlled by length
parameters. This raises the question of how to adjust the control parameters of
the Schr\""odinger equation for optimal clustering. We propose a probabilistic
framework that provides an objective function for the goodness-of-fit to the
data, enabling the control parameters to be optimised within a Bayesian
framework. This naturally yields probabilities of cluster membership and data
partitions with specific numbers of clusters. The proposed framework is tested
on real and synthetic data sets, assessing its validity by measuring
concordance with known data structure by means of the Jaccard score (JS). This
work also proposes an objective way to measure performance in unsupervised
learning that correlates very well with JS.

photon-phonon interface. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the
generation and manipulation of quantum correlations in a microfabricated
optomechanical array. We consider a system consisting of localized photonic and
phononic modes interacting locally via radiation pressure at each lattice site
with the possibility of hopping of photons and phonons between neighboring
sites. We show that such an interaction can correlate various modes of a driven
coupled optomechanical array with well-chosen system parameters. Moreover, in
the linearized regime of Gaussian fluctuations, the quantum correlations not
only survive in the presence of thermal noise, but may also be generated
thermally. We find that these optomechanical arrays provide a suitable platform
for quantum simulation of various many-body systems.

dot (QD) molecule immersed in a cavity were studied under the quantum Markovian
master equation formalism in order to account for dissipation phenomena. We
explain how for higher PhAT rates, a stronger interaction between a QD and the
cavity at off-resonance takes place through the resonant interaction of another
QD and the cavity, where the QDs interact through tunnelling. A closer look at
the system's allowed optical transitions as a function of PhAT rates showed
coalescence of the transition energies, leading to a loss of spectroscopic
resolution in the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. This coalescence occurs at
several exceptional points, suggesting a quantum dynamical phase transition.

  Manipulation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regularized autoencoders learn the latent codes, a structure with the
regularization under the distribution, which enables them the capability to
infer the latent codes given observations and generate new samples given the
codes. However, they are sometimes ambiguous as they tend to produce
reconstructions that are not necessarily faithful reproduction of the inputs.
The main reason is to enforce the learned latent code distribution to match a
prior distribution while the true distribution remains unknown. To improve the
reconstruction quality and learn the latent space a manifold structure, this
work present a novel approach using the adversarially approximated autoencoder
(AAAE) to investigate the latent codes with adversarial approximation. Instead
of regularizing the latent codes by penalizing on the distance between the
distributions of the model and the target, AAAE learns the autoencoder flexibly
and approximates the latent space with a simpler generator. The ratio is
estimated using generative adversarial network (GAN) to enforce the similarity
of the distributions. Additionally, the image space is regularized with an
additional adversarial regularizer. The proposed approach unifies two deep
generative models for both latent space inference and diverse generation. The
learning scheme is realized without regularization on the latent codes, which
also encourages faithful reconstruction. Extensive validation experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AAAE. In
comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches, AAAE generates samples with
better quality and shares the properties of regularized autoencoder with a nice
latent manifold structure.

harmless 3D ultrasound (US) can improve the efficiency and outcome of the

sonographers to localize the catheter. In this paper, we propose a catheter
detection method based on a pre-trained VGG network, which exploits 3D
information through re-organized cross-sections to segment the catheter by a
shared fully convolutional network (FCN), which is called a Direction-Fused FCN
(DF-FCN). Based on the segmented image of DF-FCN, the catheter can be localized
by model fitting. Our experiments show that the proposed method can
successfully detect an ablation catheter in a challenging ex-vivo 3D US
dataset, which was collected on the porcine heart. Extensive analysis shows
that the proposed method achieves a Dice score of 57.7%, which offers at least
an 11.8 % improvement when compared to state-of-the-art instrument detection
methods. Due to the improved segmentation performance by the DF-FCN, the
catheter can be localized with an error of only 1.4 mm.

negatively charged particles with mass-over-charge ratios up to 13,800
\textit{u/q}. At present, only a handful of anions have been characterized by
photochemical models, consisting mainly of C$_n$H$^-$ carbon chain and
C$_{n-1}$N$^-$ cyano compounds ($n=2-6$); their formation occurring essentially
through proton abstraction from their parent neutral molecules. However,
numerous other species have yet to be detected and identified. Considering the
efficient anion growth leading to compounds of thousands of \textit{u/q}, it is
necessary to better characterize the first light species. Here, we present new
negative ion measurements with masses up to 200 \textit{u/q} obtained in an
\ce{N2}:\ce{CH4} dusty plasma discharge reproducing analogous conditions to
Titan's ionosphere. We perform a comparison with high altitude CAPS-ELS
measurements near the top of Titan's ionosphere from the T18 encounter. The
main observed peaks are in agreement with the observations. However, a number
of other species (\textit{e.g.} \ce{CNN-}, \ce{CHNN-}) previously not
considered suggests an abundance of N-bearing compounds, containing two or
three nitrogen atoms, consistent with certain adjacent doubly-bonded nitrogen
atoms found in tholins. These results suggest that an N-rich incorporation into
tholins may follow mechanisms including anion chemistry, further highlighting
the important role of negative ions in Titan's aerosol growth.

information protocols. The optimum approach saturates the Helstrom bound, which
quantifies the unavoidable error probability of mistaking one state for

and diagonalization of the density matrices describing these states. Both of
these fundamental requirements become impractically difficult to obtain as the
dimension of the states grow large. In this article, we analyze quantum
illumination as a quantum channel discrimination protocol and circumvent these
issues by using the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt inner product as a measure of

with the $Chandra$ X-ray Observatory High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) in

influence of the dust scattering halo on the broad band spectrum and we argue
that dust scattering and extinction is not the most likely origin for the
narrow featureseen near the Si K edge. We identify the features of a wind in
the profiles of the strong resonance lines and we show that the wind is more
apparent in the lines from the lighter elements. We argue that this wind is
most likely associated with the companion star. We show that the intensities of
most lines can be fitted, crudely, by a single component photoionized model.
However, the iron K lines do not fit with this model. We show that the iron K
line variability as a function of orbital phase is different from the lower
energy lines, which indicates that the lines arise in physically distinct

  Approach","This is a preprint of an article accepted for EC 2019",,,,"cs.GT cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We empirically study the interplay between exploration and competition.
Systems that learn from interactions with users often engage in exploration:
making potentially suboptimal decisions in order to acquire new information for
future decisions. However, when multiple systems are competing for the same
market of users, exploration may hurt a system's reputation in the near term,
with adverse competitive effects. In particular, a system may enter a ""death
spiral"", when the short-term reputation cost decreases the number of users for
the system to learn from, which degrades its performance relative to
competition and further decreases its market share.
  We ask whether better exploration algorithms are incentivized under
competition. We run extensive numerical experiments in a stylized duopoly model
in which two firms deploy multi-armed bandit algorithms and compete for myopic
users. We find that duopoly and monopoly tend to favor a primitive ""greedy
algorithm"" that does not explore and leads to low consumer welfare, whereas a
temporary monopoly (a duopoly with an early entrant) may incentivize better
bandit algorithms and lead to higher consumer welfare. Our findings shed light
on the first-mover advantage in the digital economy by exploring the role that
data can play as a barrier to entry in online markets.

  Checking of full CTL (Extended Version)",,,,,"cs.PL cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variability models allow effective building of many custom model variants for
various configurations. Lifted model checking for a variability model is
capable of verifying all its variants simultaneously in a single run by
exploiting the similarities between the variants. The computational cost of
lifted model checking still greatly depends on the number of variants (the size
of configuration space), which is often huge.
  One of the most promising approaches to fighting the configuration space
explosion problem in lifted model checking are variability abstractions. In
this work, we define a novel game-based approach for variability-specific
abstraction and refinement for lifted model checking of the full CTL,
interpreted over 3-valued semantics. We propose a direct algorithm for solving
a 3-valued (abstract) lifted model checking game. In case the result of model
checking an abstract variability model is indefinite, we suggest a new notion
of refinement, which eliminates indefinite results. This provides an iterative
incremental variability-specific abstraction and refinement framework, where
refinement is applied only where indefinite results exist and definite results
from previous iterations are reused.

as low as $n_e(0) = 1.5\times 10^{17}\, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and matched spot
sizes in the range $ 20 \mu \mathrm{m} \lesssim W_M \lesssim 40 \mu
\mathrm{m}$. Control of these channel parameters via adjustment of the initial
cell pressure and the delay after the arrival of the channel-forming pulse is
demonstrated. For laser pulses with a peak axial intensity of $4 \times
10^{17}\, \mathrm{W\,cm}^{-2}$, highly reproducible, high-quality guiding over
more than 14 Rayleigh ranges is achieved at a pulse repetition rate of 5 Hz,
limited by the available channel-forming laser and vacuum pumping system.
Plasma channels of this type would seem to be well suited to multi-GeV laser
wakefield accelerators operating in the quasi-linear regime.

density increase across the shock front. Rankine-Hugoniot (R-H) relations
quantify these changes, correlating post-shock quantities with upstream
conditions (pre-shock) and incident shock Mach number [1-5]. These equations
describe a calorically perfect gas, but deliver a good approximation for real
gases, provided the upstream conditions are well-characterized with a
thermodynamic mixing model. Two classic thermodynamic models of gas mixtures
are Dalton's law of partial pressures and Amagat's law of partial volumes [6].
Here we show that neither thermodynamic model can accurately predict the
post-shock quantities of interest (temperature and pressure), on time scales
much longer than those associated with the shock front passage, due to their
implicit assumptions about behavior on the molecular level, including mixing
reversibility. We found that in non-reacting binary mixtures of sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6) and helium (He), kinetic molecular theory (KMT) can be used
to quantify the discrepancies found between theoretical and experimental values
for post-shock pressure and temperature. Our results demonstrate the complexity
of analyzing shock wave interaction with two highly disparate gases, while also
providing starting points for future theoretical and experimental work and
validation of numerical simulations.

we consider the continuous reachability problem for UDPN, which can be seen as
an over-approximation of the reachability problem. Our main result is a
characterization of continuous reachability for UDPN and polynomial time
algorithm for solving it. This is a consequence of a combinatorial argument,

with a first order Smectic-$A^*$--Smectic-$C^*$ (Sm-$A^*$--Sm-$C^*$)

parameter space Type I systems exhibit a macroscopically achiral (in which the
Sm-$C^*$ helical superstructure is expelled) low-tilt (LT) Sm-$C$--high-tilt
(HT) Sm-$C$ critical point, which terminates a LT Sm-$C$--HT Sm-$C$ first order
boundary. This boundary extends to an achiral-chiral triple point where the
achiral LT Sm-$C$ and HT Sm-$C$ phases coexist with the chiral Sm-$C^*$ phase.
In Type II systems the critical point, triple point, and first order boundary
are replaced by a Sm-$C^*$ region, between LT and HT achiral Sm-$C$ phases, at
low and high fields respectively. When the field is ramped up, the Type II
system displays a reentrant Sm-$C$--Sm-$C^*$-Sm-$C$ phase sequence. A
discontinuity in the tilt of the optical axis at each of the two phase
transitions means the Type II system is tristable. The system is Type I or Type
II depending on the ratio of two length scales, one is the zero-field Sm-$C^*$
helical pitch, the other depends on the latent heat at the zero-field first
order Sm-$A^*$--Sm-$C^*$ transition. A system could be experimentally tuned by
varying enantiomeric excess, between Type I and Type II behavior. We also show
this Type I vs Type II behavior is the Ising universality class analog of Type
I vs Type II behavior in XY universality class systems. Lastly, we make a
complete mapping of the phase boundaries in temperature--field--enantiomeric
excess parameter space (not just near the critical point) which shows a variety
of interesting features, including a multicritical point, tricritical points

There is a body of literature which tries to address this challenge. We created
a more expansive survey of the task by experimenting with different models and
adding new loss functions to improve results. We created a database of pairs of
satellite images and the corresponding map of the area. Our model translates
the satellite image to the corresponding standard layer map image using three
main model architectures: (i) a conditional Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) which compresses the images down to a learned embedding, (ii) a generator
which is trained as a normalizing flow (RealNVP) model, and (iii) a conditional
GAN where the generator translates via a series of convolutions to the standard
layer of a map and the discriminator input is the concatenation of the
real/generated map and the satellite image. Model (iii) was by far the most
promising of three models. To improve the results we also added a
reconstruction loss and style transfer loss in addition to the GAN losses. The
third model architecture produced the best quality of sampled images. In
contrast to the other generative model where evaluation of the model is a
challenging problem. since we have access to the real map for a given satellite
image, we are able to assign a quantitative metric to the quality of the
generated images in addition to inspecting them visually. While we are
continuing to work on increasing the accuracy of the model, one challenge has
been the coarse resolution of the data which upper-bounds the quality of the
results of our model. Nevertheless, as will be seen in the results, the
generated map is more accurate in the features it produces since the generator
architecture demands a pixel-wise image translation/pixel-wise coloring. A

  Smart Contract Platforms",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the age of Big Data, enabling task scheduling while protecting users'
privacy is critical for various decentralized applications in blockchain-based
smart contract platforms. Such a privacy-preserving task scheduler requires the
task input data to be secretly maintained until a prescribed task execution
time and be automatically recorded into the blockchain to enabling the
execution of the task at the execution time, even if the user goes offline.
While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the
problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust and involve
a single point of control. This paper presents decentralized techniques for
supporting privacy-preserving task scheduling using smart contracts in Ethereum
blockchain networks. We design a privacy-preserving task scheduling protocol
that is managed by a manager smart contract. The protocol requires a user to
schedule a task by deploying a proxy smart contract maintaining the
non-sensitive information of the task while creating decentralized secret trust
and selecting trustees from the network to maintain the sensitive information
of the task. With security techniques including secret sharing and layered
encryption as well as security deposit paid by trustees as economic deterrence,
the protocol can protect the sensitive information against possible attacks
including some trustees destroying the sensitive information (drop attack) or
secretly releasing the sensitive information before the execution time
(release-ahead attack). We demonstrate the attack-resilience of the proposed
protocol through rigorous analysis.Our implementation and experimental
evaluation on the Ethereum official test network demonstrate the low monetary
cost and the low time overhead associated with the proposed approach.

the fact that nearly constant amplitudes are usually observed is evidence that
nonlinear mechanisms inhibit the growth of finite amplitude pulsations. Models
predict that the mass of DAV convection zones is very sensitive to temperature
(i.e., $M_{\text{CZ}} \propto T_{\text{eff}}^{-90}$) leading to the possibility
that even ""small amplitude"" pulsators may experience significant nonlinear
effects. In particular, the outer turning point of finite-amplitude g-mode
pulsations can vary with the local surface temperature, producing a reflected
wave that is slightly out of phase with that required for a standing wave. This
can lead to a lack of coherence of the mode and a reduction in its global
amplitude. We compute the size of this effect for specific examples and discuss
the results in the context of Kepler and K2 observations.

obtaining statistical lower bound and especially popular for functional
estimation problems. This work aims to explain and give conditions for the
tightness of Le Cam's lower bound in functional estimation from the perspective
of convex duality. Under a variety of settings it is shown that the
maximization problem that searches for the best two-point lower bound, upon
dualizing, becomes a minimization problem that optimizes the bias-variance
tradeoff among a family of estimators.
  For estimating linear functionals of a distribution our work strengthens
prior results of Donoho-Liu \cite{DL91} (for quadratic loss) by dropping the
H\""olderian assumption on the modulus of continuity. For exponential families
our results extend those of Juditsky-Nemirovski \cite{JN09} by characterizing
the minimax risk for the quadratic loss under weaker assumptions on the
exponential family.
  We also provide an extension to the high-dimensional setting for estimating
separable functionals. Notably, coupled with tools from complex analysis, this
method is particularly effective for characterizing the ``elbow effect'' -- the
phase transition from parametric to nonparametric rates. As the main
application we derive sharp minimax rates in the Distinct elements problem
(given a fraction $p$ of colored balls from an urn containing $d$ balls, the
optimal error of estimating the number of distinct colors is $\tilde
\Theta(d^{-\frac{1}{2}\min\{\frac{p}{1-p},1\}})$) and the Fisher's species

  In this setting we determine the minimax optimal learning rates (up to
logarithmic factors). The rate displays interesting threshold behaviour: When
the regression function approaches its extrema at a sufficient rate, the
optimal learning rates are of the same order as those obtained in the
label-noise free setting. If the regression function approaches its extrema
more gradually then classification performance necessarily degrades. In
addition, we present an adaptive algorithm which attains these rates without

One usage, here called `Bell contextual' since the idea goes back to Bell, is
that if $A$, $B$ and $C$ are three quantum observables, with $A$ compatible
(i.e., commuting) with $B$ and also with $C$, whereas $B$ and $C$ are
incompatible, a measurement of $A$ might yield a different result (indicating
that quantum mechanics is contextual) depending upon whether $A$ is measured
along with $B$ (the $\{A,B\}$ context) or with $C$ (the $\{A,C\}$ context). An
analysis of what projective quantum measurements measure shows that quantum
theory is Bell noncontextual: the outcome of a particular $A$ measurement when
$A$ is measured along with $B$ would have been exactly the same if $A$ had,
instead, been measured along with $C$.
  A different definition, here called `globally (non)contextual' refers to
whether or not there is ('noncontextual') or is not ('contextual') a single
joint probability distribution that simultaneously assigns probabilities in a
consistent manner to the outcomes of measurements of a certain collection of
observables, not all of which are compatible. A simple example shows that such
a joint probability distribution can exist even in a situation where the
measurement probabilities cannot refer to properties of a quantum system, and
hence lack physical significance, even though mathematically well-defined. It
is noted that the quantum sample space, a projective decomposition of the
identity, required for interpreting measurements of incompatible properties in
different runs of an experiment using different types of apparatus has a tensor

of 2-level systems, or qubits, as the fundamental unit of quantum information.
However, recent innovations in quantum error correction and magic state
distillation protocols demonstrate that there are advantages of using d-level
quantum systems, known as \emph{qudits}, over the qubit analogues. When
designing a quantum architecture, it is crucial to consider protocols for
compilation, the optimal conversion of high-level instructions used by
programmers into low-level instructions interpreted by the machine. In this
work, we present a general purpose automated compiler for multiqudit exact
synthesis based on previous work on qubits that uses an algebraic
representation of quantum circuits called phase polynomials. We assume Clifford
gates are low-cost and aim to minimise the number of M gates in a Clifford+M
circuit, where M is the qudit analog for the qubit T or pi/8 phase gate. A
surprising result that showcases our compiler's capabilities is that we found a
unitary implementation of the CCZ or Toffoli gate that uses 4 M gates, which
compares to 7 T gates for the qubit analogue.

scales with the size of the network. For example, in planar topologies where
nodes communicate with their natural neighbors, the scaling factor is $O(n)$,
where $n$ is the number of nodes. As the size of the network increases, this
makes global convergence over the entire network less practical. On the other
hand, for several applications, such as load balancing or detection of local
events, global convergence may not be necessary or even relevant. We introduce
simple distributed iterative processes which limit the scope of the
computational task to a smaller subnetwork of the entire network. This is
achieved using one additional local parameter which controls the size of the
subnetwork. We establish termination and convergence rate of such processes in
theory, in experiment, in comparison to the well understood behavior of Markov

beneficial for an efficient transfer of energy to the electrons. In this
manuscript, we study by using full-scale three-dimensional particle-in-cell

with triangular nanostructure (previously found to allow 97% laser energy
absorption) is used . We demonstrate that the absorbed laser energy does not
depend on the dimensionality in the range of parameters presented. We also
present an analytical model for laser absorption that includes deviations from
the ideal conditions. This is supported by a numerical parameter study that
establishes the tolerance with respect to the nanostructure size, use of
different ion species, existence of preplasma, etc. We found that altering the
target thickness or using different ions does not affect the absorption, but it
does affect the energy redistribution among the different plasma species. The
optimal configuration ($h = 1~\lambda,~ w = 0.7~ \lambda$) is robust with
respect to the target fabrication errors. However, high contrast laser pulses
are required, because a pre-plasma layer with a thickness on the order of 0.5

centrals, suggesting that environment is directly quenching their star
formation. Here, we investigate whether satellite quenching is accompanied by
changes in stellar spin (quantified by the ratio of the rotational to
dispersion velocity V/$\sigma$) for a sample of massive ($M_{*}>$10$^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$) satellite galaxies extracted from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. These
systems are carefully matched to a control sample of main sequence, high
$V/\sigma$ central galaxies. As expected, at fixed stellar mass and
ellipticity, satellites have lower star formation rate (SFR) and spin than the
control centrals. However, most of the difference is in SFR, whereas the spin
decreases significantly only for satellites that have already reached the red
sequence. We perform a similar analysis for galaxies in the EAGLE
hydro-dynamical simulation and recover differences in both SFR and spin similar
to those observed in SAMI. However, when EAGLE satellites are matched to their
`true' central progenitors, the change in spin is further reduced and galaxies
mainly show a decrease in SFR during their satellite phase. The difference in
spin observed between satellites and centrals at $z\sim$0 is primarily due to
the fact that satellites do not grow their angular momentum as fast as centrals
after accreting into bigger halos, not to a reduction of $V/\sigma$ due to
environmental effects. Our findings highlight the effect of progenitor bias in
our understanding of galaxy transformation and they suggest that satellites
undergo little structural change before and during their quenching phase.

features/patterns from data without dwelling on domain expertise although seems
highly promising but comes at the cost of high reliance on large amount of
accurately labeled data, which is often hard to acquire and formulate
especially in time-series domains like anomaly detection, natural disaster
management, predictive maintenance and healthcare. As these networks completely
rely on data and ignore a very important modality i.e. expert, they are unable
to harvest any benefit from the expert knowledge, which in many cases is very
useful. In this paper, we try to bridge the gap between these data driven and
expert knowledge based systems by introducing a novel framework for
incorporating expert knowledge into the network (KINN). Integrating expert
knowledge into the network has three key advantages: (a) Reduction in the
amount of data needed to train the model, (b) provision of a lower bound on the
performance of the resulting classifier by obtaining the best of both worlds,
and (c) improved convergence of model parameters (model converges in smaller
number of epochs). Although experts are extremely good in solving different
tasks, there are some trends and patterns, which are usually hidden only in the
data. Therefore, KINN employs a novel residual knowledge incorporation scheme,
which can automatically determine the quality of the predictions made by the
expert and rectify it accordingly by learning the trends/patterns from data.
Specifically, the method tries to use information contained in one modality to
complement information missed by the other. We evaluated KINN on a real world
traffic flow prediction problem. KINN significantly superseded performance of

  Signals",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider a passive radar system that estimates the
positions and velocities of multiple moving targets by using OFDM signals
transmitted by a totally un-coordinated and un-synchronizated illuminator and
multiple receivers. It is assumed that data demodulation is performed
separately based on the direct-path signal, and the error-prone estimated data
symbols are made available to the passive radar receivers, which estimate the
positions and velocities of the targets in two stages. First, we formulate a
problem of joint estimation of the delay-Doppler of reflectors and the
demodulation errors, by exploiting two types of sparsities of the system,
namely, the numbers of reflectors (i.e., targets and clutters) and demodulation
errors are both small. This problem is non-convex and a conjugate gradient
descent method is proposed to solve it. Then in the second stage we determine
the positions and velocities of targets based on the estimated delay-Doppler in
the first stage. And two methods are proposed: the first is based on
numerically solving a set of nonlinear equations, while the second is based on
the back propagation neural network, which is more efficient. The performance
of the proposed passive OFDM radar receiver algorithm is evaluated through
extensive simulations.

Intelligent Transport Systems. However, it is difficult to analyze and predict
traffic based on image frames because the representation of each frame may vary
significantly within a short time period. This also would inaccurately
represent the traffic over a longer period of time such as the case of video.
We propose a novel bio-inspired methodology that integrates analysis of the
previous image frames of the video to represent the analysis of the current
image frame, the same way a human being analyzes the current situation based on
past experience. In our proposed methodology, called IRON-MAN (Integrated
Rational prediction and Motionless ANalysis), we utilize Bayesian update on top
of the individual image frame analysis in the videos and this has resulted in
highly accurate prediction of Temporal Motionless Analysis of the Videos (TMAV)
for most of the chosen test cases. The proposed approach could be used for TMAV
using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for applications where the number of
objects in an image is the deciding factor for prediction and results also show
that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art for the chosen test
case. We also introduce a new metric named, Energy Consumption per Training
Image (ECTI). Since, different CNN based models have different training
capability and computing resource utilization, some of the models are more
suitable for embedded device implementation than the others, and ECTI metric is
useful to assess the suitability of using a CNN model in multi-processor
systems-on-chips (MPSoCs) with a focus on energy consumption and reliability in
terms of lifespan of the embedded device using these MPSoCs.

of methods have been proposed for estimating the parameters of Weibull

interface between two domains. A micro-PL and Raman system is used to obtain
spatially resolved images of the differently doped transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs). The domain inverted lithium niobate causes changes in
the TMDs due to electrostatic doping as a result of the remnant polarization
from the substrate. Moreover, the differently doped TMDs (n-type MoSe2 and
p-type WSe2) exhibit opposite PL modulation. Distinct oppositely charged
domains were obtained with a 9-fold PL enhancement for the same single MoSe2
sheet when adhered to the positive (P+) and negative (P-) domains. This sharp
PL modulation on the ferroelectric domain results from different free electron
or hole concentrations in the materials conduction band or valence band.
Moreover, excitons dissociate rapidly at the interface between the P+ and P-
domains due to the built-in electric field. We are able to adjust the charge on
the P+ and P- domains using temperature via the pyroelectric effect and observe
rapid PL quenching over a narrow temperature range illustrating the observed PL
modulation is electronic in nature. This observation creates an opportunity to
harness the direct bandgap TMD 2D materials as an active optical component for
the lithium niobate platform using domain engineering of the lithium niobate
substrate to create optically active heterostructures that could be used for
photodetectors or even electrically driven optical sources on-chip.

retweet content promoting immunization from their accounts. Our design exploits
the structure of what information is passed on along a retweet chain on Twitter

users can identify as being originated by a celebrity are far more likely to be
liked or retweeted by users than similar tweets seen by the same users but
without the celebrities' imprimatur. By contrast, explicitly citing sources in
the tweets actually reduces diffusion. By randomizing which celebrities tweeted

influence beliefs about vaccination and knowledge of immunization-seeking

limit for LFC designs. In this paper, by doing a detailed geometrical optical
analysis of the sampling process in an LFC, we show that the effective sampling
resolution is generally higher than the number of micro-lenses. This
contribution makes it theoretically possible to break the resolution trade-off.
Our second contribution is an epipolar plane image (EPI) based super-resolution
method, which can super-resolve the spatial and angular dimensions
simultaneously. We prove that the light field is a 2D series, thus, a
specifically designed CNN-LSTM network is proposed to capture the continuity
property of the EPI. Rather than leveraging semantic information, our network
focuses on extracting geometric continuity in the EPI. This gives our method an

information. Even when the information is injected by a local unitary operation
to the system, the entanglement delocalizes it. In a recent study on
multiple-qubit systems, it is shown that a virtual qubit defined in the
correlation space plays a role of perfect storage of delocalized information,
which is called a quantum information capsule (QIC). In order to enhance the
capacity of quantum information storage, it is crucial to formulate the cases
for multiple-qudit systems and continuous-variable (CV) systems. We
analytically prove that it is possible to construct a QIC for general write
operations of the systems. It turns out that the extension to quantum field
theory is achievable. For Gaussian states, we explicitly construct a QIC for
shift write operations. We analyze the time-evolution of QIC in a CV system to
demonstrate the diffusion of information in entangled pure states.

  with Ties and Incomplete Lists",,,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the stable marriage problem (SM), a mechanism that always outputs a stable
matching is called a stable mechanism. One of the well-known stable mechanisms
is the man-oriented Gale-Shapley algorithm (MGS). MGS has a good property that
it is strategy-proof to the men's side, i.e., no man can obtain a better
outcome by falsifying a preference list. We call such a mechanism a
man-strategy-proof mechanism. Unfortunately, MGS is not a woman-strategy-proof
mechanism. Roth has shown that there is no stable mechanism that is
simultaneously man-strategy-proof and woman-strategy-proof, which is known as
Roth's impossibility theorem.
  In this paper, we extend these results to the stable marriage problem with
ties and incomplete lists (SMTI). Since SMTI is an extension of SM, Roth's
impossibility theorem takes over to SMTI. Therefore, we focus on the
one-sided-strategy-proofness. In SMTI, one instance can have stable matchings
of different sizes, and it is natural to consider the problem of finding a
largest stable matching, known as MAX SMTI. Thus we incorporate the notion of
approximation ratio used in the theory of approximation algorithms. We say that
a stable-mechanism is $c$-approximate-stable mechanism if it always returns a
stable matching of size at least $1/c$ of a largest one. We also consider a
restricted variant of MAX SMTI, which we call MAX SMTI-1TM, where only men's
lists can contain ties.
  Our results are summarized as follows: (i) MAX SMTI admits both a
man-strategy-proof 2-approximate-stable mechanism and a woman-strategy-proof
2-approximate-stable mechanism. (ii) MAX SMTI-1TM admits a woman-strategy-proof
2-approximate-stable mechanism. (iii) MAX SMTI-1TM admits a man-strategy-proof
1.5-approximate-stable mechanism. All these results are tight in terms of
approximation ratios. Also, all these strategy-proofness results apply for
strategy-proofness against coalitions.

assumption of the nonconvex objective term and additional bounded variance
assumption if applied to expectation problems. They work with both constant and
adaptive step-sizes, while allowing single sample and mini-batches. In all
these cases, we prove that our algorithms can achieve the best-known complexity

function of teeth are important goals for personal oral care. To understand the
heterogeneity in patients with diverse PD patterns, we develop BAREB, a
Bayesian repulsive biclustering method that can simultaneously cluster the PD
patients and their tooth sites after taking the patient- and site- level
covariates into consideration. BAREB uses the determinantal point process (DPP)
prior to induce diversity among different biclusters to facilitate parsimony
and interpretability. Since PD progression is hypothesized to be
spatially-referenced, BAREB factors in the spatial dependence among tooth
sites. In addition, since PD is the leading cause for tooth loss, the missing
data mechanism is non-ignorable. Such nonrandom missingness is incorporated
into BAREB. For the posterior inference, we design an efficient reversible jump
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Simulation studies show that BAREB is able to
accurately estimate the biclusters, and compares favorably to alternatives. For
real world application, we apply BAREB to a dataset from a clinical PD study,
and obtain desirable and interpretable results. A major contribution of this

By contrast, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), where the discriminative function is
restricted to 1-Lipschitz, does not suffer from such a gradient
uninformativeness problem. We further show in the paper that the model with a
compact dual form of Wasserstein distance, where the Lipschitz condition is
relaxed, may also theoretically suffer from this issue. This implies the
importance of Lipschitz condition and motivates us to study the general
formulation of GANs with Lipschitz constraint, which leads to a new family of
GANs that we call Lipschitz GANs (LGANs). We show that LGANs guarantee the
existence and uniqueness of the optimal discriminative function as well as the
existence of a unique Nash equilibrium. We prove that LGANs are generally
capable of eliminating the gradient uninformativeness problem. According to our
empirical analysis, LGANs are more stable and generate consistently higher

enable the deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on low-power

kernel in a convolutional layer independently for higher inference accuracy,
since the weight kernels in a layer exhibit different variances and hence have
different amounts of redundancy. The quantization bitwidth or bit number (QBN)
directly decides the inference accuracy, latency, energy and hardware overhead.
To effectively reduce the redundancy and accelerate CNN inferences, various
weight kernels should be quantized with different QBNs. However, prior works
use only one QBN to quantize each convolutional layer or the entire CNN,
because the design space of searching a QBN for each weight kernel is too
large. The hand-crafted heuristic of the kernel-wise QBN search is so
sophisticated that domain experts can obtain only sub-optimal results. It is
difficult for even deep reinforcement learning (DRL) Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG)-based agents to find a kernel-wise QBN configuration that can
achieve reasonable inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a
hierarchical-DRL-based kernel-wise network quantization technique, AutoQ, to
automatically search a QBN for each weight kernel, and choose another QBN for
each activation layer. Compared to the models quantized by the state-of-the-art
DRL-based schemes, on average, the same models quantized by AutoQ reduce the
inference latency by 54.06\%, and decrease the inference energy consumption by
50.69\%, while achieving the same inference accuracy.

observed on the surface of MoS2 using scanning tunneling microscopy can vary by
up to one order of magnitude with an increase in the electric field. This
unusual phenomenon originates from quantum trapping, where the electron relaxed
from the resonant electron in the FER is momentarily trapped in the potential
well on the MoS2 surface. Because the relaxed electron and the resonant
electron have the same spin and the action of the Pauli exclusion principle,
the lifetimes of the resonant electrons can be substantially prolonged when the
relaxed electrons engage in the resonance trapping. The linewidth of the FER is
thus shrunk considerably to as narrow as 12 meV. Moreover, it was found that
the valley intensities around the FER are zero, indicating that MoS2 has an
energy gap above the vacuum level. By using the energies of FERs, the potential
of the band bending in the MoS2 interior can be measured precisely.

fixed scales, which do not comply with the nature of dynamical temporal
patterns among sequences. In this paper, we propose Adaptively Scaled Recurrent
Neural Networks (ASRNN), a simple but efficient way to handle this problem.
Instead of using predefined scales, ASRNNs are able to learn and adjust scales
based on different temporal contexts, making them more flexible in modeling
multiscale patterns. Compared with other multiscale RNNs, ASRNNs are bestowed
upon dynamical scaling capabilities with much simpler structures, and are easy
to be integrated with various RNN cells. The experiments on multiple sequence

remediation and protection, energy conversion and storage. Most of these
diverse applications are results of a large diversity of the electronic states

applications in catalysis because of low density of active sites in these
materials. Size reduction of oxide catalyst is a strategy to improve the active
site density. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of single atomic metal oxide
in which the oxide size reaches its minimum. However, the catalytic mechanism
in this SATO is determined by a quasi atom physics which is fundamentally
distinct from the traditional size effect, and also is in contrast to the
standard condensed matter physics. SATO results in a record high and stable
sunlight photocatalytic degradation rate of 0.24, which exceeds those of
available photocatalysis by approximately two orders of magnitude. The
photocatalytic process is enabled by a quasi atom physical mechanism, in which,
an electron in the spin up channel is excited from HOMO to LUMO+1 state, which
can only occur in SATO with W5+.

solar cells, because it has a high absorption coefficient and a nearly ideal
band gap of 1.48 eV for solar cell according to the Shockley-Queisser limit.
However, its solar to electricity power conversion efficiency (PCE) is hindered
by the relatively low open circuit voltage (VOC) due to intrinsic defect
related issues. Here, we propose the strategy of improving CdTe solar cell
performance byr reducing the ""ideal"" band gap of CdTe to gain more
short-circuit current from long-wavelength absorption without sacrificing much
VOC. Alloying CdTe with CdSe seems to be the most appropriate approach to
reduce the band gap because of the large optical bowing and relatively small
lattice mismatch in this system, even though CdSe has larger band gap than
CdTe. Using the first principle hybrid functional calculation, we find that the
minimum band gap of the CdTe1-xSex alloy can be reduced from 1.48 eV at x=0 to
1.39 eV at x=0.32. We also show that the formation of the alloy can improve the
defect property, for example, p-type doping of CdTe by CuCd can be greatly
enhanced by the alloying effects.

rehabilitation remains unclear. To investigate how tDCS reorganizes brain
circuitry, nineteen post-stroke patients underwent rehabilitation sessions with
bi-hemispheric real vs sham tDCS intervention. Resting motor threshold
measurements showed tDCS evoked higher excitability in the motor cortex that
enhanced the descending conduction from the lesioned primary motor cortex to
the target hand muscle. Granger causality analysis further revealed brain
circuitry rewiring among the lesioned cerebellum, premotor, and primary motor
cortex in the tDCS group compared to the sham owing to the newly formed
connections close to the anodal electrode. Rebuilding of these critical
pathways was clear via the increase of event related desynchronisation (ERD)
and white matter integrity in the same lesioned region. Furthermore, only the
tDCS group demonstrated a positive recovery trend in the penumbra regions by
the longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. To
interpret tDCS mechanism, we introduce a polarized gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) theory, where GABAA receptor activity depends on the orientation of
dipolar GABA that can be manipulated by tDCS field. Results suggest that tDCS
intervention lowers motor excitability via re-orienting GABA, leading to
reorganization of the lesioned cortical network, and the motor descending
pathway, finally the recovery of motor function.

of offloading compute to centralized servers if they are uncertain locally or
want to run more accurate, compute-intensive models. However, cloud robotics

sending high data-rate video or LIDAR from multiple robots over congested

offloading strategy improves vision task performance by between 1.3-2.6x of

Remarkably, the temporal credit assignment has been performed on rate-coded

the spike count of each neuron is used as a surrogate for gradient

that the proposed learning rule achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on all

spike rate and hardware constraints into the SNN learning, which is superior to
the indirect approach in which conventional artificial neural networks are
first trained and then converted to SNNs. Hence, it allows direct deployment to
the neuromorphic hardware and supports efficient inference. Notably, a test
accuracy of 98.40% was achieved on the MNIST dataset in our experiments with
only 10 simulation time steps, when the same latency constraint is imposed

Question Answering (XQA), i.e., generating natural language (NL) explanations
for the Visual Question Answering (VQA) problem. We generate NL explanations
comprising of the evidence to support the answer to a question asked to an
image using two sources of information: (a) annotations of entities in an image
(e.g., object labels, region descriptions, relation phrases) generated from the
scene graph of the image, and (b) the attention map generated by a VQA model
when answering the question. We show how combining the visual attention map
with the NL representation of relevant scene graph entities, carefully selected
using a language model, can give reasonable textual explanations without the
need of any additional collected data (explanation captions, etc). We run our
algorithms on the Visual Genome (VG) dataset and conduct internal user-studies
to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach over a strong baseline. We have
also released a live web demo showcasing our VQA and textual explanation
generation using scene graphs and visual attention.

Collision detection does not always perform as expected and collision avoidance
is still an active research area. Collision avoidance works well for fixed
robot-camera setups, however, if they are shifted around, Eye-to-Hand
calibration becomes invalid making it difficult to accurately run many of the
existing collision avoidance algorithms. We approach the problem by presenting
a stand-alone system capable of detecting the robot and estimating its
position, including individual joints, by using a simple 2D colour image as an
input, where no Eye-to-Hand calibration is needed. As an extension of previous
work, a two-stage transfer learning approach is used to re-train a
multi-objective convolutional neural network (CNN) to allow it to be used with
heterogeneous robot arms. Our method is capable of detecting the robot in
real-time and new robot types can be added by having significantly smaller
training datasets compared to the requirements of a fully trained network. We
present data collection approach, the structure of the multi-objective CNN, the
two-stage transfer learning training and test results by using real robots from
Universal Robots, Kuka, and Franka Emika. Eventually, we analyse possible

evolutionary increases in phenotypic complexity can be caused by a
threshold-like response to growing ecological pressures resulting from
evolutionary diversification at a given level of complexity. Acquisition of a
new phenotypic feature allows an evolving species to escape this pressure but
can typically be expected to carry significant physiological costs. Therefore,
the ecological pressure should exceed a certain level to make such an
acquisition evolutionarily successful. We present a detailed quantitative
description of this process using a microevolutionary competition model as an
example. The model exhibits sequential increases in phenotypic complexity
driven by diversification at existing levels of complexity and the resulting
increase in competitive pressure, which can push an evolving species over the
barrier of physiological costs of new phenotypic features.

Hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice with the effective interactions that
induce local $\Gamma_3$ states. By evaluating multipole susceptibility in a
random phase approximation, we find that the hybridization between $\Gamma_7$

quadrupole ordering. We also emphasize that $\Gamma_3$ quadrupole ordering can
be understood from the concept of {\it multipole nesting}, in which the Fermi
surface region with large $\Gamma_8$ orbital density should be nested on the
area with a significant $\Gamma_7$ component when the positions of the Fermi
surfaces are shifted by the ordering vector. This concept cab be intuitively
understood from the fact that local $\Gamma_3$ doublets are mainly composed of
two singlets between $\Gamma_8$ and $\Gamma_7$ orbitals. Finally, we discuss

stellar initial mass function (IMF) lies at the heart of all star formation
theories. In this paper, we study the earliest phases of star formation with a
series of high-resolution numerical simulations that include the formation of
sinks. In particular, we focus on the transition from cores to sinks within a
massive molecular filament. We compare the CMF and IMF between magnetized and
unmagnetized simulations, and between different resolutions. We find that
selecting cores based on their kinematic virial parameter excludes collapsing
objects because they host large velocity dispersions. Selecting only the
thermally unstable magnetized cores, we observe that their mass-to-flux ratio
spans almost two orders of magnitude for a given mass. We also see that, when
magnetic fields are included, the CMF peaks at higher core mass values with
respect to pure hydrodynamical simulations. Nonetheless, all models produce
sink mass functions with a high-mass slope consistent with Salpeter. Finally,
we examine the effects of resolution and find that, in isothermal simulations,
even models with very high dynamical range fail to converge in the mass
function. Our main conclusion is that, although the resulting CMFs and IMFs
have similar slopes in all simulations, the cores have slightly different sizes
and kinematical properties when a magnetic field is included. However, a core
selection based on the mass-to-flux ratio alone is not enough to alter the
shape of the CMF, if we do not take thermal stability into account. Finally, we
conclude that extreme care should be given to resolution issues when studying
sink formation with an isothermal equation of state.

bursty write requests. Although burst buffer can improve I/O performance in
many cases, we find that it has some limitations such as requiring large SSD
capacity and harmonious overlapping between computation phase and data flushing
phase. In this paper, we propose a scheme, called SSDUP+1. SSDUP+ aims to
improve the burst buffer by addressing the above limitations. First, in order
to reduce the demand for the SSD capacity, we develop a novel method to detect
and quantify the data randomness in the write traffic. Further, an adaptive
algorithm is proposed to classify the random writes dynamically. By doing so,
much less SSD capacity is required to achieve the similar performance as other
burst buffer schemes. Next, in order to overcome the difficulty of perfectly
overlapping the computation phase and the flushing phase, we propose a pipeline
mechanism for the SSD buffer, in which data buffering and flushing are
performed in pipeline. In addition, in order to improve the I/O throughput, we
adopt a traffic-aware flushing strategy to reduce the I/O interference in HDD.
Finally, in order to further improve the performance of buffering random writes
in SSD, SSDUP+ transforms the random writes to sequential writes in SSD by
storing the data with a log structure. Further, SSDUP+ uses the AVL tree
structure to store the sequence information of the data. We have implemented a
prototype of SSDUP+ based on OrangeFS and conducted extensive experiments. The
experimental results show that our proposed SSDUP+ can save an average of 50%
SSD space, while delivering almost the same performance as other common burst
buffer schemes. In addition, SSDUP+ can save about 20% SSD space compared with
the previous version of this work, SSDUP, while achieving 20%-30% higher I/O
throughput than SSDUP.

theory and density functional theory that gave promising results when applied
to the one-dimensional Hubbard model. Despite its overall good performance,
SOET faces a computational cost problem as its auxiliary impurity-interacting
system remains the size of the full system (which is problematic as the
computational cost increases exponentially with system size). In this work,
this issue is circumvented by employing the Schmidt decomposition, thus leading
to a drastic reduction of the computational cost while retaining the same
accuracy. We show that this projected version of SOET (P-SOET) is competitive
with other embedding techniques such as density matrix embedding theory (DMET)
[G. Knizia and G. K-L. Chan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 186404 (2012)]. In contrast
to the latter, density functional contributions come naturally into play in
P-SOET's framework without any additional computational cost or double counting
effect. As an important result, the density-driven Mott-Hubbard transition
(which is displayed by multiple impurity sites in DMET or in dynamical
mean-field theory) is well described, for the first time, with a single
impurity site.

relaxation (muSR) and neutron powder diffraction studies. The material used in
the present investigation is an off-stoichiometric alloy of nominal
composition, Ni[2.04]Mn[1.4]Sn[0.56]. This prototypical alloy, similar to other
members in the Ni-Mn-Sn series, orders ferromagnetically below T[CA] (= 320 K),
and undergoes martensitic type structural transition at T[MS] (= 290 K), which
is associated with the sudden loss of magnetization. The sample regains its
magnetization below another magnetic transition at T[CM] = 260 K. Eventually,
the composition shows a step-like anomaly at T[B] = 120 K, which is found to
coincide with the blocking temperature of exchange bias effect observed in the
alloy. In our study, the initial asymmetry A_[10] ) of the $\mu$SR data falls
rapidly below T[CA], indicating the onset of bulk magnetic order. A[10] regains
its full asymmetry value below T[MS] suggesting the collapse of the
ferromagnetic order into a fully disordered paramagnetic state. Below the
second magnetic transition at T[CM], asymmetry drops again, confirming the
re-entrance of a long range ordered state. Interestingly, A[10] increases
sluggishly below T[B], indicating that the system attains a disordered/glassy
magnetic phase below T[B], which is responsible for the exchange bias and
frequency dispersion in the ac susceptibility data as previously reported. The
neutron powder diffraction data do not show any magnetic superlattice
reflections, ruling out the possibility of a long range antiferromagnetic state
at low temperatures. The ground state is likely to be comprised of a
concentrated metallic spin-glass in the backdrop of an ordered ferromagnetic
state.

proton bunches via a dipole magnet. The dipole magnet also induces an
energy-dependent spatial horizontal spread on the electron bunch which then
impacts on a scintillator screen. The scintillation photons emitted are
transported via three highly-reflective mirrors to an intensified CCD camera,
housed in a dark room, which passes the images to the CERN controls system for
storage and further analysis. Given the known magnetic field and determination
of the efficiencies of the system, the spatial spread of the scintillation
photons can be converted to an electron energy distribution. A lamp attached on

with calibration of the scintillator screen's response to electrons carried out

flow conditions is investigated numerically using a high-order,
adaptive-in-time boundary integral method. In a quiescent flow, two nearby
vesicles move slowly towards each other under the adhesive potential, pushing
out fluid between them to form a vesicle doublet at equilibrium. A lubrication
analysis on such draining of a thin film gives the dependencies of draining
time on adhesion strength and separation distance that are in good agreement
with numerical results. In a planar extensional flow we find a stable vesicle
doublet forms only when two vesicles collide head-on around the stagnation
point. In a microfluid trap where the stagnation of an extensional flow is
dynamically placed in the middle of a vesicle doublet through an active control
loop, novel dynamics of a vesicle doublet are observed. Numerical simulations
show that there exists a critical extensional flow rate above which adhesive
interaction is overcome by the diverging stream, thus providing a simple method
to measure the adhesion strength between two vesicle membranes. In a planar
shear flow, numerical simulations reveal that a vesicle doublet may form
provided that the adhesion strength is sufficiently large at a given vesicle
reduced area. Once a doublet is formed, its oscillatory dynamics is found to
depend on the adhesion strength and their reduced area. Furthermore the
effective shear viscosity of a dilute suspension of vesicle doublets is found
to be a function of the reduced area. Results from these numerical studies and
analysis shed light on the hydrodynamic and rheological consequences of
adhesive interactions between vesicles in a viscous fluid.

greatly benefit MR-guided radiotherapy/interventions and cardiac imaging, but
remains a challenge to date. In image-based methods, where motion is indirectly
estimated by reconstructing and co-registering images, a trade off between
spatial and temporal resolution of the motion-fields has to be made due to the
image reconstruction step. However, we observe that motion-fields are very
compressible due to the spatial correlation of internal body motion. Therefore,
reconstructing only motion-fields directly from surrogate signals or k-space
data without the need for image reconstruction should require few data, and
could eventually result in high spatio-temporal resolution motion-fields. In
this work we introduce MR-MOTUS, a framework that makes exactly this possible.
The two main innovations of this work are (1) a signal model that explicitly
relates the k-space signal of a deforming object to general non-rigid
motion-fields, and (2) model-based reconstruction of motion-fields directly
from highly undersampled k-space data by solving the corresponding inverse
problem. The signal model is derived by modeling a deforming object as a static
reference object warped by dynamic motion-fields, such that the dynamic signal
is given explicitly in terms of motion-fields. We validate the signal model
through numerical experiments with an analytical phantom, and reconstruct
motion-fields from retrospectively undersampled in-vivo data. Results show that
the reconstruction quality is comparable to state-of-the-art image registration
for undersampling factors as high as 63 for 3D non-rigid respiratory motion and
as high as 474 for 3D rigid head motion.

investigate tetraquarks composed of $us\bar{d}\bar{b}$ and $ud\bar{s}\bar{b}$
in two structures: meson-meson structure and diquark-antidiquark structure.
Neither bound state nor resonance state is found in the system composed of
$us\bar{d}\bar{b}$. The reported $X(5568)$ cannot be explained as a molecular
state or a diquark-antidiquark resonance of $us\bar{d}\bar{b}$ in present
calculation. However, two bound states of the diquark-antidiquark structure are
obtained in the tetraquarks system composed of $ud\bar{s}\bar{b}$: an $IJ=00$
state with the mass of $5701$ MeV, and an $IJ=01$ state with the mass of $5756$
MeV, which maybe the partners of $X(5568)$ states. Our results indicate that
the diquark-antidiquark configuration would be a good choice for the
tetraquarks $ud\bar{s}\bar{b}$ with quantum numbers $IJ=00$ and $IJ=01$. The
tetraquarks composed of $ud\bar{s}\bar{b}$ is more possible to form bound
states than the one composed of $us\bar{d}\bar{b}$. These bound states are
worth investigating in future experiments.

Depending on the geometry of the stretching experiment, the force threshold for
the overstretching transition is around 65 or 110 pN. Although the mechanisms
behind force-induced melting have been correctly described by Rouzina and
Bloomfield \cite{RouzinaBloomfield2001a}, neither force threshold has been
exactly calculated by theory. In this work, a detailed analysis of the
force-extension curve is presented, based on a description of single-stranded
DNA in terms of the discrete Kratky-Porod model, consistent with (i) the
contour length expected from the crystallographically determined monomer
distance, and (ii) a high value of the elastic stretch modulus arising from
covalent bonding. The value estimated for the ss-DNA persistence length,
$\lambda = 1.0 $ nm, is at the low end of currently known estimates and
reflects the intrinsic stiffness of the partially, or fully stretched state,
where electrostatic repulsion effects are expected to be minimal. A detailed
analysis of single- and double-stranded DNA free energies provides estimates of
the overstretching force thresholds. In the unconstrained geometry, the
predicted threshold is 64 pN. In the constrained geometry, after allowing for
the entropic penalty of the plectonemic topology of the molten state, the
predicted threshold is 111 pN.

gradient-based framework for efficient architecture search by sharing
information across several tasks. We start by training many model architectures
on several related (training) tasks. When a new unseen task is presented, the
framework performs architecture inference in order to quickly identify a good
candidate architecture, before any model is trained on the new task. At the
core of our framework lies a deep value network that can predict the
performance of input architectures on a task by utilizing task meta-features
and the previous model training experiments performed on related tasks. We
adopt a continuous parametrization of the model architecture which allows for
efficient gradient-based optimization. Given a new task, an effective
architecture is quickly identified by maximizing the estimated performance with
respect to the model architecture parameters with simple gradient ascent. It is
key to point out that our goal is to achieve reasonable performance at the
lowest cost. We provide experimental results showing the effectiveness of the
framework despite its high computational efficiency.

nonlinear thermo-poroelasticity model problem. The thermo-poroelastic model
problem we consider is formulated as a three-field system of PDE's, consisting
of an energy balance equation, a mass balance equation and a momentum balance
equation, where the primary variables are temperature, fluid pressure, and
elastic displacement. Due to the presence of a nonlinear convective transport
term in the energy balance equation, it is convenient to have access to both
the pressure and temperature gradients. Hence, we introduce these as two
additional variables and extend the original three-field model to a five-field
model. For the numerical solution of this five-field formulation, we compare
three approaches that differ by how we treat the coupling/decoupling between
the flow and/from heat and/from mechanics; these approaches have in common a
simultaneous application of the fixed-stress splitting scheme on both the
non-linearity and the coupling structure of the problem. More precisely, the
derived procedures transform a nonlinear and fully coupled problem into a set
of simpler subproblems to be solved sequentially in an iterative fashion. We
provide a convergence proof for the derived algorithms, and validate our
results through several numerical examples.

to capacity loss, which depend on cell chemistry and are affected by
temperature, state of charge, and cycling rate. Here we show that, despite this

curve, for several cell types aged under various different conditions. We
discuss the statistical origin of this common behaviour, and the testing

(vdW) materials holds promises for novel spintronic devices with exceptional
performances. However, in order to utilize 2D vdW magnets for building
spintronic nanodevices such as magnetic memories, key challenges remain in
terms of effectively switching the magnetization from one state to the other
electrically. Here, we devise a bilayer structure of Fe3GeTe2/Pt, in which the
magnetization of few-layered Fe3GeTe2 can be effectively switched by the
spin-orbit torques (SOTs) originated from the current flowing in the Pt layer.
The effective magnetic fields corresponding to the SOTs are further
quantitatively characterized using harmonic measurements. Our demonstration of
the SOT-driven magnetization switching in a 2D vdW magnet could pave the way
for implementing low-dimensional materials in the next-generation spintronic
applications.

structures of Laplacian eigenfunctions and their deep relationship to the
quantitative behaviours of the eigenfunctions in two dimensions. We introduce a
new notion of generalized singular lines of the Laplacian eigenfunctions, and
carefully study these singular lines and the nodal lines. The studies reveal
that the intersecting angle between two of those lines is closely related to
the vanishing order of the eigenfunction at the intersecting point. We
establish an accurate and comprehensive quantitative characterisation of the
relationship. Roughly speaking, the vanishing order is generically infinite if
the intersecting angle is {\it irrational}, and the vanishing order is finite
if the intersecting angle is rational. In fact, in the latter case, the
vanishing order is the degree of the rationality. The theoretical findings are
original and of significant interest in spectral theory. Moreover, they are
applied directly to some physical problems of great importance, including the
inverse obstacle scattering problem and the inverse diffraction grating
problem. It is shown in a certain polygonal setup that one can recover the
support of the unknown scatterer as well as the surface impedance parameter by
finitely many far-field patterns. Indeed, at most two far-field patterns are
sufficient for some important applications. Unique identifiability by finitely
many far-field patterns remains to be a highly challenging fundamental
mathematical problem in the inverse scattering theory.

similar to the existing approaches deriving electromagnetism from special

Maxwell's equations with minimal physical assumptions. In particular, without
postulating Coulomb's law, homogeneous Maxwell's equations are written down by
following a route different from the standard one, i.e. first introducing
electromagnetic potentials in order to write down a relativistic invariant
action, which is just the inverse approach to the usual one. Also, Feynman's
derivation of the Lorentz force exclusively follows from its linearity in the
charge velocity and from relativistic invariance. Going further, i.e. adding
the inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations, requires some more physical input, and
can be done by just following conventional lines, hence this task was not
pursued here. Despite its incompleteness, this way of proceeding is of great
historical and epistemological significance. We also comment about its possible
relevance to didactics, as an interesting supplement to usual treatments.

topological quantum computation. It can be achieved through tuning the coupling
between the two Majorana modes to be exchanged and two ancillary Majorana
modes. However, this coupling also makes the braiding subject to
environment-induced decoherence. Here, we study the effects of decoherence on
the diabatic errors in the braiding process for a set of time-dependent
Hamiltonians with finite smoothness. To this end, we employ the master equation
to calculate the diabatic excitation population for three kinds of decoherence
processes. (1) Only pure dehasing: the scaling of the excitation population
changed from $T^{-2k-2}$ to $T^{-1}$ ($k$ is the number of the Hamiltonian's
time derivatives vanishing at the initial and final times) as the braiding
duration $T$ exceeds a certain value. (2) Only relaxation: the scaling
transforms from $T^{-2k-2}$ to $T^{-2}$ for $k=0$ and to $T^{-a}$ ($a>3$) for
$k>0$. (3) Pure dephasing and relaxation: the original scaling switches to
$T^{-1}$ firstly and then evolves to $T^{-2}$ in the adiabatic limit.
Interestingly, the third scaling-varying style holds even when the expectation
of pure dephasing rate is much smaller than that of the relaxation rate, which
is attributed to the vanishing relaxation at the turning points of the
braiding.

parameter estimation and model-order selection using a Bayesian framework and
has been shown to be especially useful for the analysis of the structure of
beam-sensitive nanomaterials. In order to avoid beam damage, images of such
materials are usually acquired using a limited incoming electron dose resulting
in a low contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) which makes visual inspection
unreliable. This creates a need for an objective and quantitative approach. The
present paper describes the methodology of the MAP probability rule, gives its
step-by-step derivation and discusses its algorithmic implementation for atom
column detection. In addition, simulation results are presented showing that
the performance of the MAP probability rule to detect the correct number of
atomic columns from HAADF STEM images is superior to that of other model-order
selection criteria, including the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Moreover, the MAP probability rule is
used as a tool to evaluate the relation between STEM image quality measures and
atom detectability resulting in the introduction of the so-called integrated
CNR (ICNR) as a new image quality measure that better correlates with atom
detectability than conventional measures such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)

Floquet-state occupation probabilities for arbitrarily strong driving. This

different from the temperature of the bath, and independent of the spin quantum

magnetism of the nonequilibrium steady state of a driven ideal paramagnetic

such a material to the combined fields is predicted to show several unexpected
features, even allowing one to turn a paramagnet into a diamagnet under strong
driving. Thus, we argue that experimental measurements of this response may
provide key paradigms for the emerging field of periodic thermodynamics.

encountered in many other tasks including model calibration, discrimination,
identifiability and checking as well as optimum experiment design, sensitivity
analysis, bifurcation analysis and other. The aim of this review paper is to
explore developments of past decade to understand what BRN models are commonly

collection of about 700 publications excluding books in computational biology

performed as text mining using scripts to automate search for relevant keywords

provided to facilitate understanding of estimation methods which are used for

anti vinyl mercaptan to the millimeter domain using a frequency-multiplication
spectrometer. The species were produced by a radiofrequency discharge in
1,2-ethanedithiol. Additional transitions have been re-measured in the
centimeter band using Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy to better
determine rest frequencies of transitions with low-$J$ and low-$K_a$ values.
Experimental investigations were supported by quantum chemical calculations on
the energetics of both the [C$_2$,H$_4$,S] and [C$_2$,H$_4$,O] isomeric
families. Interstellar searches for both syn and anti vinyl mercaptan as well
as vinyl alcohol were performed in the EMoCA (Exploring Molecular Complexity
with ALMA) spectral line survey carried out toward Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N2)
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Highly accurate
experimental frequencies (to better than 100 kHz accuracy) for both syn and
anti isomers of vinyl mercaptan have been measured up to 250 GHz; these deviate
considerably from predictions based on extrapolation of previous microwave
measurements. Reliable frequency predictions of the astronomically most
interesting millimeter-wave lines for these two species can now be derived from
the best-fit spectroscopic constants. From the energetic investigations, the
four lowest singlet isomers of the [C$_2$,H$_4$,S] family are calculated to be
nearly isoenergetic, which makes this family a fairly unique test bed for
assessing possible reaction pathways. Upper limits for the column density of
syn and anti vinyl mercaptan are derived toward the extremely molecule-rich
star-forming region Sgr B2(N2) enabling comparison with selected complex
organic molecules.

biological parameters for investigating the stress score of the subject. The

virtually impossible in high dimensions. This motivates the problem studied in
this work, which is to find universal lower and upper bounds of the extreme
Value-at-Risk under practically estimable constraints. That is, we study the
infimum and supremum of the extreme Value-at-Risk functional, over the infinite
dimensional space of all possible spectral measures that meet a finite set of
constraints. We focus on extremal coefficient constraints, which are popular
and easy to interpret in practice. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we
show that optimization problems over an infinite dimensional space of spectral
measures are in fact dual problems to linear semi-infinite programs (LSIPs) --
linear optimization problems in an Euclidean space with an uncountable set of
linear constraints. This allows us to prove that the optimal solutions are in
fact attained by discrete spectral measures supported on finitely many atoms.

results for the lower bounds as well as closed form solutions for both the
lower- and upper-bounds of extreme Value-at-Risk in the special case of a

degree $\mathbf{d}$ such that $\sf G1$ holds for $T$ and $T$ is weaker than

compresses an input network into a series of smaller networks using a
community-awareness compressing strategy. Then, an existing NRL method is used
to learn node embeddings for each compressed network. Finally, the node
embeddings of the input network are obtained by concatenating the node
embeddings from all compressed networks. Empirical studies for link prediction

applications in spiral particle separators used in the mining and mineral
processing industries. In this paper, we extend the previous work of Lee,
Stokes, Bertozzi (2013) by studying thin-film flows of mono-disperse
particle-laden fluid in helically-wound channels of arbitrary centreline
curvature and torsion, and arbitrary cross-sectional shape. In the case where
the particles are uniformly distributed through the depth of the film,
significant analytic progress can be made: the governing equations reduce to a
single nonlinear ordinary differential equation, which is readily integrated
numerically to obtain the solution subject to appropriate boundary conditions.
Motivated by possible application to the design of spiral separators, we
consider the effects of changing the channel centreline geometry, the
cross-sectional shape and the particle density on the resulting flows and the
radial distribution of particles. Our results support the findings in Arnold,
Stokes, Green (2016) regarding the effect of channel centreline geometry and
cross-sectional shape on flows in particle-free regions. In particle-rich
regions, similar effects are seen, although the primary velocity is lower due
to increased effective mixture viscosity. \ys{Of key interest, is the effect of
channel geometry on the focusing of the particles, for given fluxes of fluid
and particles. We find that introducing a trench into the channel
cross-section, a feature often used in commercial spiral particle separators,
leads to smaller radial width of the particle-rich region, i.e. sharper
focusing of the particles, which is consistent with experiments showing that
channel geometry influences particle separation in a spiral separator.

made space-, as well as time-dependent. The border separating the low-field
region with under-tilted Dirac fermions from the high-field region with

accurately assessing their impact plays a crucial role in managing grid assets

impulsive, which means they are of high power density and vary in a fast and

methods unsuitable. This paper proposes an algorithm, which captures the
inter-temporal response of grid assets and allows fast assessment through an

analytical models for two generic classes of grid assets (continuous and
discrete operating assets) and recast their cost functions in the statistical
settings of PEV charging. Distinct from simulation-based methods, the proposed
method is analytical, and thus greatly reduce the computation resources and

algorithm has been demonstrated on a set of power distribution networks in
Columbus metropolitan area, in comparison with the conventional assessment
methods.

robustness requires that a matching must be stable in the classic sense, even
if the agents slightly change their preferences. Near stability, on the other
hand, imposes that a matching must become stable (again, in the classic sense)
provided the agents are willing to adjust their preferences a bit. Both of our
concepts are quantitative; together they provide means for a fine-grained
analysis of stability for matchings. Moreover, our concepts allow to explore
the trade-offs between stability and other criteria of societal optimality,
such as the egalitarian cost and the number of unmatched agents. We investigate
the computational complexity of finding matchings that implement certain
predefined trade-offs. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that given
agents' preferences returns a socially optimal robust matching, and we prove
that finding a socially optimal and nearly stable matching is computationally
hard.

to estimate the (counterfactual) resource usage under the possible

intervention strategy that leads to the best expected health outcome accounting
for a health system's resource constraints. We then apply this method to
