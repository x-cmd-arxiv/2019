  signals",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to their ubiquitous and pervasive nature, Wi-Fi networks have the
potential to collect large-scale, low-cost, and disaggregate data on multimodal
transportation. In this study, we develop a semi-supervised deep residual
network (ResNet) framework to utilize Wi-Fi communications obtained from
smartphones for the purpose of transportation mode detection. This framework is
evaluated on data collected by Wi-Fi sensors located in a congested urban area
in downtown Toronto. To tackle the intrinsic difficulties and costs associated
with labelled data collection, we utilize ample amount of easily collected
low-cost unlabelled data by implementing the semi-supervised part of the
framework. By incorporating a ResNet architecture as the core of the framework,
we take advantage of the high-level features not considered in the traditional
machine learning frameworks. The proposed framework shows a promising
performance on the collected data, with a prediction accuracy of 81.8% for
walking, 82.5% for biking and 86.0% for the driving mode.

Exploitation of unlabeled data during training is thus a long pursued objective

auxiliary task (different, but related to the supervised task) for which data
is abundantly available. In this paper, we show how ranking can be used as a
proxy task for some regression problems. As another contribution, we propose an
efficient backpropagation technique for Siamese networks which prevents the
redundant computation introduced by the multi-branch network architecture. We
apply our framework to two regression problems: Image Quality Assessment (IQA)
and Crowd Counting. For both we show how to automatically generate ranked image
sets from unlabeled data. Our results show that networks trained to regress to
the ground truth targets for labeled data and to simultaneously learn to rank
unlabeled data obtain significantly better, state-of-the-art results for both
IQA and crowd counting. In addition, we show that measuring network uncertainty
on the self-supervised proxy task is a good measure of informativeness of
unlabeled data. This can be used to drive an algorithm for active learning and
we show that this reduces labeling effort by up to 50%.

difficult issue to be tackled for many non-volatile memories (NVMs). In this
paper, we first propose novel neural network (NN) detectors by using the
multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and the recurrent neural network (RNN),
which can effectively tackle the unknown offset of the channel. However,
compared with the conventional threshold detector, the NN detectors will incur
a significant delay of the read latency and more power consumption. Therefore,
we further propose a novel dynamic threshold detector (DTD), whose detection
threshold can be derived based on the outputs of the proposed NN detectors. In
this way, the NN-based detection only needs to be invoked when the error
correction code (ECC) decoder fails, or periodically when the system is in the
idle state. Thereafter, the threshold detector will still be adopted by using
the adjusted detection threshold derived base on the outputs of the NN
detector, until a further adjustment of the detection threshold is needed.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DTD based on the RNN detection
can achieve the error performance of the optimum detector, without the prior
knowledge of the channel.

capacity constraint in cellular network design. In fact, this tight integration
of access and backhaul is one of the key ways in which 5G millimeter wave
(mm-wave) heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) differ from traditional
settings where the backhaul network was designed independently from the radio
access network (RAN). With the goal of elucidating key design trends for this
new paradigm, we develop an analytical framework for a two-tier HetNet with IAB
where the macro base stations (MBSs) provide mm-wave backhaul to the small cell
base stations (SBSs). For this network, we derive the downlink rate coverage
probability for two types of resource allocations at the MBS: 1) integrated
resource allocation (IRA): where the total bandwidth (BW) is dynamically split
between access and backhaul, and 2) orthogonal resource allocation (ORA): where
a static partition is defined for the access and backhaul communications. Our
analysis concretely demonstrates that offloading users from the MBSs to SBSs
may not provide similar rate improvements in an IAB setting as it would in a
HetNet with fiber-backhauled SBS. Our analysis also shows that it is not
possible to improve the user rate in an IAB setting by simply densifying the
SBSs due to the bottleneck on the rate of wireless backhaul links between MBS

online. The idea is that Alice wraps her message to Bob in layers of encryption
to form an ""onion,"" and routes it through a series of intermediaries. Each
intermediary's job is to decrypt (""peel"") the onion it receives to obtain
instructions for where to send it next, and what to send. The intuition is
that, by the time it gets to Bob, the onion will have mixed with so many other
onions, that its origin will be hard to trace even for an adversary that
observes the entire network and controls a fraction of the participants,
possibly including Bob.
  In spite of its widespread use in practice, until now no onion routing
protocol was known that simultaneously achieved, in the presence of an active
adversary that observes all network traffic and controls a constant fraction of
the participants, (a) fault-tolerance, where even if a few of the onions are
dropped, the protocol still delivers the rest; (b) reasonable communication and
computational complexity as a function of the security parameter and the number
of participants; and (c) anonymity.
  In this paper, we give the first onion routing protocol that meets these
goals: our protocol (a) tolerates a polylogarithmic (in the security parameter)
number of dropped onions and still delivers the rest; (b) requires a
polylogarithmic number of rounds and a polylogarithmic number of onions sent
per participant per round; and (c) achieves anonymity. We also show that to
achieve anonymity in a fault-tolerant fashion via onion routing, this number of
onions and rounds is necessary.
  Of independent interest, our analysis introduces two new security properties
of onion routing -- mixing and equalizing -- and we show that together they
imply anonymity.

much studied in the past. In this paper, we introduce a new class of problems:
transport in Hamiltonian systems with slowly changing phase space structure
that are not order one perturbations of a given Hamiltonian. This class of
problems is very important for many applications, for instance in celestial
mechanics. As an example, we study a class of one-dimensional Hamiltonians that
depend explicitly on time and on stochastic external parameters. The variations
of the external parameters are responsible for a distortion of the phase space
structures: chaotic, weakly chaotic and regular sets change with time. We show
that theoretical predictions of transport rates can be made in the limit where
the variations of the stochastic parameters are very slow compared to the
Hamiltonian dynamics. Exact asymptotic results can be obtained in the classical
case where the Hamiltonian dynamics is integrable for fixed values of the
parameters. For the more interesting chaotic Hamiltonian dynamics case, we show
that two mechanisms contribute to the transport. For some range of the
parameter variations, one mechanism -called transport by migration together
with the mixing regions - is dominant. We are then able to model transport in
phase space by a Markov model, the local diffusion model, and to give
reasonably good transport estimates.

While the prevalent first-principles methods have provided significant insight
into characters of point defects in a transparent manner, the crucial
connection between crystal stoichiometry and chemical potentials is usually not
made. However, ad hoc choices for chemical potentials can lead to nonphysical
negative formation energies in some Fermi level ranges, along with questions
about charge balance. Herein, we formulate a canonical framework describing how
the chemical potential of each element is directly linked to the composition of
the crystal under (off-)stoichiometric conditions instead of the ad hoc
assumption that the chemical potential is the elemental limit under a certain
growth condition. Consequently, the chemical potential changes with the Fermi
level within the band gap, and the formation energies are positive. Using such
an approach, we present $ab$ $initio$ results for native point defects in BAs,
a semiconductor with ultra-high room temperature thermal conductivity. We find
that antisites are the constitutional defects in off-stoichiometric material,
while B$_\mathrm{As}$ antisites and B vacancies dominate in the stoichiometric
material. We further discuss the thermodynamic equilibrium and charge
neutrality point in BAs in light of our stoichiometry-determined chemical
potentials. As discussed, our work offers a more applicable and accessible
approach to tackle defect formation energies in semiconductors, especially the

including support vector machine (SVM) for classification, principal component
analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and regression for dependency
estimation, we need the inner products of the data samples, rather than the
data samples themselves.
  Motivated by the above observation, we introduce the problem of private inner
product retrieval for distributed machine learning, where we have a system
including a database of some files, duplicated across some non-colluding
servers. A user intends to retrieve a subset of specific size of the inner
products of the data files with minimum communication load, without revealing
any information about the identity of the requested subset. For achievability,
we use the algorithms for multi-message private information retrieval. For
converse, we establish that as the length of the files becomes large, the set
of all inner products converges to independent random variables with uniform
distribution, and derive the rate of convergence. To prove that, we construct
special dependencies among sequences of the sets of all inner products with
different length, which forms a time-homogeneous irreducible Markov chain,
without affecting the marginal distribution. We show that this Markov chain has
a uniform distribution as its unique stationary distribution, with rate of
convergence dominated by the second largest eigenvalue of the transition
probability matrix. This allows us to develop a converse, which converges to a
tight bound in some cases, as the size of the files becomes large. While this
converse is based on the one in multi-message private information retrieval,
due to the nature of retrieving inner products instead of data itself some
changes are made to reach the desired result.

approach the segmentation output is a binary mask of perfusion ROI that has
zero values for air pixels, pixels that represent non-brain tissues, and
cerebrospinal fluid pixels. The process of binary mask producing starts with
extracting low intensity pixels by thresholding. Optimal low-threshold value is
solved by obtaining intensity pixels information from the approximate
anatomical brain location. Holes filling algorithm and binary region growing
algorithm are used to remove falsely detected regions and produce region of
only brain tissues. Further, CSF pixels extraction is provided by thresholding
of high intensity pixels from region of only brain tissues. Each time-point
image of the perfusion sequence is used for adjustment of CSF pixels location.
The segmentation results were compared with the manual segmentation performed
by experienced radiologists, considered as the reference standard for
evaluation of proposed approach. On average of 120 images the segmentation
results have a good agreement with the reference standard. All detected

bundles, columnar liquid crystals, and superconductor vortex arrays; to
familiar macroscopic materials, like ropes, cables and textiles. Interactions
between the constituent filaments in such systems are most sensitive to the
{\it distance of closest approach} between the central curves which approximate
their configuration, subjecting these distinct assemblies to common geometric
constraints. In this paper, we consider two distinct notions of constant
spacing in multi-filament packings in $\mathbb{R}^3$: {\it equidistance}, where
the distance of closest approach is constant along the length of filament
pairs; and {\it isometry}, where the distances of closest approach between all
neighboring filaments are constant and equal. We show that, although any smooth
curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$ permits one dimensional families of collinear
equidistant curves belonging to a ruled surface, there are only two families of
tangent fields with mutually equidistant integral curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The
relative shapes and configurations of curves in these families are highly
constrained: they must be either (isometric) developable domains, which can
bend, but not twist; or (non-isometric) constant-pitch helical bundles, which
can twist, but not bend. Thus, simultaneously bent and twisted filament
textures, such as twisted toroids of condensed DNA plasmids or wire ropes, are
doubly frustrated: twist frustrates constant neighbor spacing in the
cross-section, while non-equidistance requires longitudinal variations of
inter-filament spacing. To illustrate the consequences of the failure of
equidistance, we compare spacing in three ""almost equidistant"" ansatzes for
twisted toroidal bundles and use our formulation of equidistance to construct

is a necessary component for safety. Existing approaches are, however,
expensive in computation due to high dimensionality of point clouds. We utilize
the 3D data more efficiently by representing the scene from the Bird's Eye View

oriented 3D object estimates decoded from pixel-wise neural network
predictions. The input representation, network architecture, and model
optimization are especially designed to balance high accuracy and real-time
efficiency. We validate PIXOR on two datasets: the KITTI BEV object detection
benchmark, and a large-scale 3D vehicle detection benchmark. In both datasets
we show that the proposed detector surpasses other state-of-the-art methods
notably in terms of Average Precision (AP), while still runs at >28 FPS.

domain gap by projecting the source and target domains into a common
association space through an unsupervised ``cross-grafted representation
stacking'' (CGRS) mechanism. Specifically, we construct variational
auto-encoders (VAE) for the two domains, and form bidirectional associations by
cross-grafting the VAEs' decoder stacks. Furthermore, generative adversarial
networks (GAN) are employed for label alignment (LA), mapping the target domain
data to the known label space of the source domain. The overall adaptation
process hence consists of three phases: feature representation learning by
VAEs, association generation, and association label alignment by GANs.
Experimental results demonstrate that our CGRS-LA approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art on a number of unsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks.

networks (PRN0). In this paper, we propose the Network Dynamics (ND) model,
which reconstructs a PRN0 by adding back its edges according to some recipe,
while its nodes are fixed at native (PDB) locations. A PRN0 reconstruction will
eventually reconstruct its SCN0, but only after exploring several non-native
shortcut network (SCN) configurations. It is these other SCN configurations
that are of interest to us, as they produce the statistics to evaluate the
different recipes. The recipes vary from each other slightly to investigate the
effect of different edge orderings on protein folding. An edge ordering is
deemed more successful if it produces a stronger correlation with experimental
folding rates. Over proteins of different chain fold types, this basic
requirement is best satisfied when a recipe favours earlier restoration of
edges with smaller sequence separation, and earlier restoration of edges
incident on nodes with larger remaining degree within the 1-hop neighborhood of
a previously selected node. Further, this recipe generated more route-like
trajectories over SCN space and a wider range of simulated folding rates, both
of which signal cooperative two-state folding behavior. It also produced better
correspondence between ND calculated phi-values and experimental phi-values
obtained from a set of ten transition state ensembles (TSE). Also introduced is
the local centrality measure which uses centrality of initial fold
substructures to yield calculated phi-values from PRN0s with even better
overall correspondence than ND calculated phi-values. Preliminary investigation
with mixed ND recipes by chain fold type suggests that concocting further
context-sensitive recipes by chain fold type and combining them could improve
ND. This search task may be better undertaken by machine learning.

We initiate a new direction via two simultaneous deviation points:
generalization to imperfect-information games and a game-theoretic approach. We
study how one should act when facing an opponent whose lookahead is limited. We
study this for opponents that differ based on their lookahead depth, based on
whether they, too, have imperfect information, and based on how they break
ties. We characterize the hardness of finding a Nash equilibrium or an optimal
commitment strategy for either player, showing that in some of these variations
the problem can be solved in polynomial time while in others it is PPAD-hard,
NP-hard, or inapproximable. We proceed to design algorithms for computing
optimal commitment strategies---for when the opponent breaks ties favorably,
according to a fixed rule, or adversarially. We then experimentally investigate
the impact of limited lookahead. The limited-lookahead player often obtains the
value of the game if she knows the expected values of nodes in the game tree

way the delay enters the system. We consider a special class of nonlinear
systems with delay obtained by taking a gradient dynamical system with a
two-well ""potential"" function and replacing the argument of the right-hand side
function with its delayed version. This choice of the system is motivated by
the relative ease of its graphical interpretation, and by its relevance to a
recent approach to use delay in finding the global minimum of a multi-well

hypothesise and verify the possibility to qualitatively predict the
delay-induced effects, such as a chain of homoclinic bifurcations one by one
eliminating local attractors and enabling the phase trajectory to spontaneously
visit vicinities of all local minima. The key phenomenon here is delay-induced
reorganisation of manifolds, which cease to serve as barriers between the local
minima after homoclinic bifurcations. Despite the general scenario being quite
universal in two-well potentials, the homoclinic bifurcation comes in various
versions depending on the fine features of the potential. Our results are a

In the first ``historical'' model the star is assumed to be comprised of a
fluid core and an elastic crust with the same density. We compare the response
of stars with different masses and equations of state to a decreasing
centrifugal force, finding smaller deformations for heavier stars: the strain
angle is peaked at the equator and turns out to be a decreasing function of the
mass.We introduce a second, more refined, model in which the core and the crust
have different densities and the gravitational potential of the deformed body
is self-consistently accounted for. Also in this case the strain angle is a
decreasing function of the stellar mass, but its maximum value is at the poles
and is always larger than the corresponding one in the one-density model by a
factor of two. Finally, within the present analytic approach, it is possible to
estimate easily the impact of the Cowling approximation: neglecting the
perturbations of the gravitational potential, the strain angle is 40\% of the
one obtained with the complete model.

architecture based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We consider a network
where a fleet of UAVs at a fixed altitude flies on planned trajectories and IoT
devices on the ground are scheduled to transmit their data to the UAVs when the

transmissions of the IoT devices. As a result, network performance is
determined by the geometric and dynamic characteristics of the system. We
propose a joint stationary model for UAVs and IoT devices and then evaluate the
interference, the coverage probability, and the data rate of the typical UAV.
To assess the harvesting capability of the proposed architecture, we derive a
formula for the amount of data uploaded from each IoT device to a UAV. We also
establish a linear relationship between the UAV coverage and the harvesting
capability of the network, which provides insights into the design of the
proposed harvesting scheme. In addition, we use our analytical results to
numerically show that there exists a trade-off between the uploaded data and
the size of the IoT scheduling window. Specifically, for a given UAV and IoT

can reduce data quality and have a direct impact on inference drawn from

is unfeasible given the volume and velocity of data the sensors produce. Here,
we proposed an automated framework that provides early detection of outliers in
water-quality data from in situ sensors caused by technical issues.The
framework was used first to identify the data features that differentiate
outlying instances from typical behaviours. Then statistical transformations
were applied to make the outlying instances stand out in transformed data
space. Unsupervised outlier scoring techniques were then applied to the
transformed data space and an approach based on extreme value theory was used
to calculate a threshold for each potential outlier. Using two data sets
obtained from in situ sensors in rivers flowing into the Great Barrier Reef
lagoon, Australia, we showed that the proposed framework successfully
identified outliers involving abrupt changes in turbidity, conductivity and
river level, including sudden spikes, sudden isolated drops and level shifts,
while maintaining very low false detection rates. We implemented this framework
in the open source R package oddwater.

of the membrane potential dynamics of its constituent neurons, which propagates
across the neuronal tissue via electrical signalling. We recently reported the
existence of electrical signalling in a much simpler organism, the bacterium
Bacillus subtilis. In dense bacterial communities known as biofilms,
nutrient-deprived B. subtilis cells in the interior of the colony use
electrical communication to transmit stress signals to the periphery, which
interfere with the growth of peripheral cells and reduce nutrient consumption,
thereby relieving stress from the interior. Here we explicitly address the
interplay between metabolism and electrophysiology in bacterial biofilms, by
introducing a spatially-extended mathematical model that combines the metabolic
and electrical components of the phenomenon in a discretised reaction-diffusion
scheme. The model is experimentally validated by environmental and genetic
perturbations, and confirms that metabolic stress is transmitted through the
bacterial population via a potassium wave. Interestingly, this behaviour is
reminiscent of cortical spreading depression in the brain, characterised by a
wave of electrical activity mediated by potassium diffusion that has been
linked to various neurological disorders, calling for future studies on the
evolutionary link between the two phenomena.

objective (e.g., sum-rate) is maximized. In centralized networks such as
cellular networks, this task is carried by the base station which gathers the
channel state information (CSI) from the users and computes the optimal
solution. In distributed networks such as ad-hoc and device-to-device (D2D)
networks, no base station exists and conveying global CSI between users is
costly or simply impractical. When the CSI is time varying and unknown to the
users, the users face the challenge of both learning the channel statistics
online and converge to a good channel allocation. This introduces a multi-armed
bandit (MAB) scenario with multiple decision makers. If two users or more
choose the same channel, a collision occurs and they all receive zero reward.
We propose a distributed channel allocation algorithm that each user runs and
converges to the optimal allocation while achieving an order optimal regret of
O\left(\log T\right). The algorithm is based on a carrier sensing multiple
access (CSMA) implementation of the distributed auction algorithm. It does not
require any exchange of information between users. Users need only to observe a
single channel at a time and sense if there is a transmission on that channel,
without decoding the transmissions or identifying the transmitting users. We
demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using simulated LTE and 5G
channels.

proliferation of blockchain-based decentralized applications including
applications that store and manage a wide range of data. Current smart
contracts are designed to be executed solely by miners and are revealed
entirely on-chain, resulting in reduced scalability and privacy. In this paper,
we discuss that scalability and privacy of smart contracts can be enhanced by
splitting a given contract into an off-chain contract and an on-chain contract.
Specifically, functions of the contract that involve high-cost computation or
sensitive information can be split and included as the off-chain contract, that
is signed and executed by only the interested participants. The proposed
approach allows the participants to reach unanimous agreement off-chain when
all of them are honest, allowing computing resources of miners to be saved and
content of the off-chain contract to be hidden from the public. In case of a
dispute caused by any dishonest participants, a signed copy of the off-chain
contract can be revealed so that a verified instance can be created to make
miners enforce the true execution result. Thus, honest participants have the
ability to redress and penalize any fraudulent or dishonest behavior, which
incentivizes all participants to honestly follow the agreed off-chain contract.
We discuss techniques for splitting a contract into a pair of on/off-chain
contracts and propose a mechanism to address the challenges of handling
dishonest participants in the system. Our implementation and evaluation of the
proposed approach using an example smart contract demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach in Ethereum.

give rise to extremely deformed dynamical regimes and patterns. Those latter,
may suddenly turn into a stream of nuclear clusters, resembling collimated
jets. Because the underlying instabilities are inadequately described by usual
modelling approaches based on equilibrium approximations, this mechanism
resulted rather unnoticed, even though it should be frequently registered in
experiments. We employ the Boltzmann-Langevin equation to specifically address
out-of-equilibrium conditions and handle dynamical fluctuations. An interesting
interplay between surface and volume instabilities is discussed for the first
time. Stable and rather regular patterns of streaming clusters arise from these
conditions. Counterintuitively, we find that these clustered structures are not
triggered by cohesive forces and they recall the granular flow of a stream of

therefore not limited to timescales longer than the trapping period. We find
that fast gates designed for micromotion-free environments have significantly
reduced fidelity in the presence of micromotion. We show that when fast gates
are designed to account for the RF-induced micromotion, they can, in fact,
out-perform fast gates in the absence of micromotion. The state-dependent force
due to the laser induces energy shifts that are amplified by the
state-independent forces producing the micromotion. This enhancement is present
for all trapping parameters and is robust to realistic sources of experimental
error. This result paves the way for fast two-qubit entangling gates on
scalable 2D architectures, where micromotion is necessarily present on at least

Popular supervised learning models such as deep neural networks are considered

however, it is known that the performance of supervised learning approaches
highly relies on the availability and quality of labeled training data. In
Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) applications, the lack of labeled incipient

proposes using Monte Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) to enhance the supervised

$\kappa(G)$ is $\Theta\big(tw(G)\big/\sqrt{\log tw(G)}\big)$. This implies that
the average-case complexity of $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$ is $n^{o(tw(G))}$ when $G$ is

approach based on alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM), which
can eliminate the need for complex iterative pruning and fine-tuning procedure
and achieve a target compression ratio with only one run of pruning and
fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of
single-shot channel pruning. The proposed method introduces filter-level
sparsity during training and can achieve competitive performance with a simple
heuristic pruning criterion (L1-norm). Extensive evaluations have been
conducted with various widely-used benchmark architectures and image datasets
for object classification purpose. The experimental results on classification
accuracy show that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art network

of direct principal value integral over the positive frequency axis and the
method by transferring into the imaginary axis, this method avoids the

scattering photon GF in enough to get a convergent result. It is numerically
demonstrated in the case for a quantum emitter (QE) located around a nanosphere

calculated by the time domain method through solving Schr\""{o}dinger equation

the spread of infectious diseases, but have generally overlooked the fact that
most realistic networks are dynamical rather than static. In this paper, we
study a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model with vaccination in a
dynamical contact network of moving individuals, where we regard mobile
individuals as random walkers that are allowed to perform long-range jumps.
Different from previous studies of epidemics in a random walk network with a
constant interaction radius, we consider the scenario where the individuals
have a heterogeneous distribution of interaction radius $r$ and infected
individuals are vaccinated with a probability depending on the interaction
radius distribution. We derive the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$
and explore the stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria of the model.
Both theoretical and simulation results reveal that the distribution of
individual interaction radius has significant effects on the basic reproduction
number and the epidemic prevalence. In general, the disease will break out more
readily in the population with a more heterogeneous radius distribution;
however resulting in a lower epidemic prevalence. Interestingly, the results
suggest that an optimal vaccination intervention for disease prevention and
control is achievable regardless of the radius distribution. Furthermore, some
interesting results on the structure of the underlying contact network are
shown to have strong correlation with the epidemic dynamics. This study
provides potential implications for developing efficient containment measures
against infectious disease while considering the spatial constraints of moving
individuals.

in order to offer specific services, often for the purpose of improving the
user's experience while using such applications. However, even when user data
is privatized by employing privacy-preserving mechanisms (PPM), users' privacy
may still be compromised by an external party who leverages statistical
matching methods to match users' traces with their previous activities. In this
paper, we obtain the theoretical bounds on user privacy for situations in which
user traces are matchable to sequences of prior behavior, despite anonymization
of data time series. We provide both achievability and converse results for the
case where the data trace of each user consists of independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random samples drawn from a multinomial distribution, as
well as the case that the users' data points are dependent over time and the

many models consider growing filaments pushing against a movable obstacle or
barrier. In order to grow, the filaments need space and hence it is necessary
to move the barrier. Two different mechanisms for this growth are widely
considered in literature. In one class of models (type $A$), the filaments can
directly push the barrier and move it, thereby performing some work in the
process. In another type of models (type $B$), the filaments wait till thermal
fluctuations of the barrier position create enough space between the filament
tip and the barrier, and then they grow by inserting one monomer in that gap.
The difference between these two types of growth seems microscopic and rather a
matter of modelling details. However, we find that this difference has
important effect on many qualitative features of the models. In particular, how
the relative time-scale between the barrier dynamics and filament dynamics
influences the force generation properties, are significantly different for
type $A$ and $B$ models. We illustrate these differences for three types of
barrier: a rigid wall-like barrier, an elastic barrier and a barrier with
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamics. Our numerical simulations match well with our
analytical calculations. Our study highlights the importance of taking the
details of filament-barrier interaction into account while modelling force
generation properties of actin filaments.

three dimensional cubic lattice. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that
the system exhibits four different phases as the density of cubes is increased:
disordered, layered, sublattice ordered, and columnar ordered. In the layered
phase, the system spontaneously breaks up into parallel slabs of size $2\times
L \times L$ where only a very small fraction cubes do not lie wholly within a
slab. Within each slab, the cubes are disordered; translation symmetry is thus
broken along exactly one principal axis. In the solid-like sublattice ordered
phase, the hard cubes preferentially occupy one of eight sublattices of the
cubic lattice, breaking translational symmetry along all three principal
directions. In the columnar phase, the system spontaneously breaks up into
weakly interacting parallel columns of size $2\times 2\times L$ where only a
very small fraction cubes do not lie wholly within a column. Within each
column, the system is disordered, and thus translational symmetry is broken
only along two principal directions. Using finite size scaling, we show that
the disordered-layered phase transition is continuous, while the
layered-sublattice and sublattice-columnar transitions are discontinuous. We
construct a Landau theory written in terms of the layering and columnar order
parameters, which is able to describe the different phases that are observed in
the simulations and the order of the transitions. Additionally, our results
near the disordered-layered transition are consistent with the $O(3)$
universality class perturbed by cubic anisotropy as predicted by the Landau

high-symmetry systems such as cubic or hexagonal systems, a proper
consideration of low-symmetry systems such as monoclinic or triclinic crystals
demands a clear distinction between the TEC tensor and the lattice-parameter
TECs along the crystallographic directions. The latter is more complicated and
it involves integrating the equations of motion for the primitive lattice
vectors, with input from the TEC tensor. A first-principles study of the TEC is
carried out for the first time on a monoclinc crystal, where we unveil high TEC
anisotropies in a recently reported monoclinic phase of niobium trisulfide
(NbS3) crystal with a relatively large primitive cell (32 atoms per cell) using
density-functional theory. We find the occurrence of a negative TEC tensor
component is largely due to the mechanical property rather than the anharmonic
effect, contrary to the common belief. Our theoretical treatment of the
monoclinic system with a single off-diagonal tensor element could be routinely
generalized to any crystal system, including the lowest-symmetry triclinic

target attribute of a sensitive dataset which can only be queried through a
specific class of real-world privacy-preserving algorithms which we call
bounded perturbation algorithms. A defining property of such an algorithm is
that it perturbs answers to the queries by adding zero-mean noise distributed
within a bounded (possibly undisclosed) range. Other key properties of the
algorithm include only allowing restricted queries (enforced via an online
interface), suppressing answers to queries which are only satisfied by a small
group of individuals (e.g., by returning a zero as an answer), and adding the
same perturbation to two queries which are satisfied by the same set of
individuals (to thwart differencing or averaging attacks). A real-world example
of such an algorithm is the one deployed by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics' (ABS) online tool called TableBuilder, which allows users to create
tables, graphs and maps of Australian census data [30]. We assume an attacker
(say, a curious analyst) who is given oracle access to the algorithm via an
interface. We describe two attacks on the algorithm. Both attacks are based on
carefully constructing (different) queries that evaluate to the same answer.
The first attack finds the hidden perturbation parameter $r$ (if it is assumed
not to be public knowledge). The second attack removes the noise to obtain the
original answer of some (counting) query of choice. We also show how to use
this attack to find the number of individuals in the dataset with a target
attribute value $a$ of any attribute $A$, and then for all attribute values
$a_i \in A$. Our attacks are a practical illustration of the (informal)
fundamental law of information recovery which states that ``overly accurate

examine the extent to which packet timing can be used to facilitate WF attacks.
We first propose a new set of timing-related features based on burst-level
characteristics to further identify more ways that timing patterns could be
used by classifiers to identify sites. Then we evaluate the effectiveness of
both raw timing and directional timing which is a combination of raw timing and
direction in a deep-learning-based WF attack. Our closed-world evaluation shows
that directional timing performs best in most of the settings we explored,
achieving: (i) 98.4% in undefended Tor traffic; (ii) 93.5% on WTF-PAD traffic,
several points higher than when only directional information is used; and (iii)
64.7% against onion sites, 12% higher than using only direction. Further
evaluations in the open-world setting show small increases in both precision
(+2%) and recall (+6%) with directional-timing on WTF-PAD traffic. To further
investigate the value of timing information, we perform an information leakage
analysis on our proposed handcrafted features. Our results show that while
timing features leak less information than directional features, the
information contained in each feature is mutually exclusive to one another and
can thus improve the robustness of a classifier.

its strong capabilities to encode word content, CBOW embeddings perform well on
a wide range of downstream tasks while being efficient to compute. However,
CBOW is not capable of capturing the word order. The reason is that the
computation of CBOW's word embeddings is commutative, i.e., embeddings of XYZ
and ZYX are the same. In order to address this shortcoming, we propose a
learning algorithm for the Continuous Matrix Space Model, which we call
Continual Multiplication of Words (CMOW). Our algorithm is an adaptation of
word2vec, so that it can be trained on large quantities of unlabeled text. We
empirically show that CMOW better captures linguistic properties, but it is
inferior to CBOW in memorizing word content. Motivated by these findings, we
propose a hybrid model that combines the strengths of CBOW and CMOW. Our
results show that the hybrid CBOW-CMOW-model retains CBOW's strong ability to
memorize word content while at the same time substantially improving its
ability to encode other linguistic information by 8%. As a result, the hybrid
also performs better on 8 out of 11 supervised downstream tasks with an average
improvement of 1.2%.

ideal quantum gases. Especially, using an analytic continuation treatment, we
discuss the application of the heat kernel technique to Fermi gases in which
the expansion diverges when the fugacity $z>1$. In order to calculate the
modification of heat kernel coefficients caused by external potentials, we
suggest an approach for calculating the expansion of the global heat kernel of
the operator $-\Delta+U\left( x\right) $ based on an approximate method of the
calculation of spectrum in quantum mechanics. At last, we discuss the
properties of quantum gases under the condition of weak and complete

their conductance signature in non-uniform topological insulator nano-wires. We
modelled the non-uniform nano-wires as junction between two cylindrical
nano-wires with different radius. In the limit of wire length being much larger
than its radius, the surface state of the nanowire splits into one dimensional
Dirac modes propagating along the axis of the cylinder owing to radial
confinement. The sign of the mass gap in each of these Dirac mode is decided by
angular momentum quantum number corresponding to the rotational motion of the
electron about the axis of the cylindrical. Application of an external magnetic
flux through the cylindrical nanowires enables us to tune the mass gap from
positive to negative value across the junction. Due to this flux tunable band
inversion, controlled by the external magnetic filed, Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes
can be made to appear or disappear at the junction. We compute differential
conductance of our topological insulator nanowire junction and show that a
quantized conductance peak appears at zero-energy (zero-bias) in the presence
of the Jackiw-Rebbi mode.

reached so far on the standardization of data definition languages (DDLs) for

ongoing in many standardization and community groups. Although some basic

graph databases, full support is missing allowing to constraint property graphs
with more or less flexibility. In this paper, we focus on two different
perspectives from which a PG schema should be considered, as being descriptive
or prescriptive, and we show how it would be possible to switch from one to
another as the application under development gains more stability. Apart from
proposing concise schema DDL inspired by Cypher syntax, we show how schema
validation can be enforced through homomorphisms between PG schemas and PG
instances; and how schema evolution can be described through the use of graph
rewriting operations. Our prototypical implementation demonstrates feasibility
and shows the need of offering high-level query primitives to accommodate
flexible graph schema requirements as showcased in our work.

We demonstrate that this framework extends to momentum exchange in

Focussing on the latter, we show that the dilemma resolution is not limited to
discriminating between kinematic and canonical momenta but also involves a

existence of two momenta in materials, plasmas, and waveguides, for which light

show that diversity has varying effects on team effectiveness: although diverse

DeepMIMO dataset generation framework has two important features. First, the
DeepMIMO channels are constructed based on accurate ray-tracing data obtained
from Remcom Wireless InSite. The DeepMIMO channels, therefore, capture the
dependence on the environment geometry/materials and transmitter/receiver
locations, which is essential for several machine learning applications.
Second, the DeepMIMO dataset is generic/parameterized as the researcher can
adjust a set of system and channel parameters to tailor the generated DeepMIMO
dataset for the target machine learning application. The DeepMIMO dataset can
then be completely defined by the (i) the adopted ray-tracing scenario and (ii)
the set of parameters, which enables the accurate definition and reproduction
of the dataset. In this paper, an example DeepMIMO dataset is described based
on an outdoor ray-tracing scenario of 18 base stations and more than one

Water and
complex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to first form on the ice mantles
and subsequently are released into the gas phase due to star formation
activity. However, the critical question is whether ice mantles can survive
stellar radiation when grains are being heated from $T_{d}\sim 10\rm K$ to
$\gtrsim 100$ K. In this paper, we first study the effect of suprathermal grain
rotation driven by the intense radiation of young stellar objects (YSOs) on the
ice mantles. We find that the entire ice mantles can be disrupted into small
fragments by centrifugal stress before the water ice and COMs desorb via
thermal sublimation. We then study the consequence of resulting ice fragments
and find that tiny fragments of radius $a \lesssim 10$\AA~ exhibit transient
release of COMs due to thermal spikes, whereas larger fragments can facilitate
thermal sublimation at much higher rates than from the original icy grain or
the same rate but with temperatures of $\sim 20-40$ K lower. We find that
rotational desorption is efficient for hot cores/corinos from the inner to
outer regions where the temperature drops to $T_{\rm gas}\sim 40\rm K$ and
$n_{\rm H}\sim 10^{4}\rm cm^{-3}$. We discuss the implications of this
mechanism for desorption of COMs and water ice in various environments,
including outflow cavity walls, photodissociation regions, and protoplanetary
disks. Finally, we show that very large aggregate grains can be disrupted into
individual icy grains via rotational disruption mechanism, followed by
rotational desorption of ice mantles.

Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion and denoted HSIC, are widely used to
statistically decide whether or not two random vectors are dependent. Recently,
non-parametric HSIC-based statistical tests of independence have been
performed. However, these tests lead to the question of the choice of the
kernels associated to the HSIC. In particular, there is as yet no method to
objectively select specific kernels with theoretical guarantees in terms of
first and second kind errors. One of the main contributions of this work is to
develop a new HSIC-based aggregated procedure which avoids such a kernel
choice, and to provide theoretical guarantees for this procedure. To achieve
this, we first introduce non-asymptotic single tests based on Gaussian kernels
with a given bandwidth, which are of prescribed level $\alpha \in (0,1)$. From
a theoretical point of view, we upper-bound their uniform separation rate of
testing over Sobolev and Nikol'skii balls. Then, we aggregate several single
tests, and obtain similar upper-bounds for the uniform separation rate of the
aggregated procedure over the same regularity spaces. Another main contribution
is that we provide a lower-bound for the non-asymptotic minimax separation rate
of testing over Sobolev balls, and deduce that the aggregated procedure is
adaptive in the minimax sense over such regularity spaces. Finally, from a
practical point of view, we perform numerical studies in order to assess the
efficiency of our aggregated procedure and compare it to existing independence

Artificial Intelligence is difficult when the decision process or internal

together, a number of extra-musical cues are used to augment musical
communication and expose mental or emotional states which affect musical
decisions and the effectiveness of the collaboration. We developed a
collaborative improvising AI drummer that communicates its confidence through
an emoticon-based visualisation. The AI was trained on musical performance
data, as well as real-time skin conductance, of musicians improvising with
professional drummers, exposing both musical and extra-musical cues to inform
its generative process. Uni- and bi-directional extra-musical communication
with real and false values were tested by experienced improvising musicians.
Each condition was evaluated using the FSS-2 questionnaire, as a proxy for

a combination of SRT predictors to further improve the approximation accuracy

parallel SRT algorithm is based on both tree decomposition and adaptive radial
basis function (RBF) explorations, whereby for each child a sparse and proper
RBF refinement is added to the approximation by minimizing the norm of the
residual inherited from its parent. The convergence results are established for
both SRTs and SRFs. The worst case time complexity of SRTs is
$\mathcal{O}(N\log_2N)$ for the initial work and $\mathcal{O}(\log_2N)$ for
each prediction, meanwhile, the worst case storage requirement is
$\mathcal{O}(N\log_2N)$, where the $N$ data points can be arbitrary

Dimethyl-ether displays excited torsional and vibrational levels at low energy

to extend the analysis of the rotational spectrum over the ground state. Its
spectrum in the THz region is rather complex due to the coupling of the
torsional overtones $2\nu_{11}$ and $2\nu_{15}$ with the COC bending mode, and
the presence of many hot bands. The torsional overtones are set here at
$2\nu_{11}=385.2$~cm$^{-1}$ and $2\nu_{15}=482.0$~cm$^{-1}$ for
$^{12}$CH$_3$O$^{12}$CH$_3$, and $2\nu_{11}=385.0$~cm$^{-1}$ and
$2\nu_{15}=481.1$~cm$^{-1}$ for $^{13}$CH$_3$O$^{12}$CH$_3$. The new assignment
of $2\nu_{11}$ is downshifted around $\sim 10$~cm$^{-1}$ with respect to the
literature. All the other (hot) bands have been re-assigned consistently. In
addition, the infrared-forbidden torsional fundamental band $\nu_{11}$ is
observed here at 197.8~cm$^{-1}$. The new spectral characterization in the THz
region reported here provides improved values of the Hamiltonian parameters, to
be used in the analysis of the rotational spectra of DME isotopologues for
further astrophysical detections.

recently shown the potential to replace recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in a
variety of NLP tasks. However, it is not clear if the self-attention network
could be a good alternative of RNNs in automatic speech recognition (ASR),
which processes the longer speech sequences and may have online recognition
requirements. In this paper, we present a RNN-free end-to-end model:
self-attention aligner (SAA), which applies the self-attention networks to a
simplified recurrent neural aligner (RNA) framework. We also propose a
chunk-hopping mechanism, which enables the SAA model to encode on segmented
frame chunks one after another to support online recognition. Experiments on
two Mandarin ASR datasets show the replacement of RNNs by the self-attention
networks yields a 8.4%-10.2% relative character error rate (CER) reduction. In
addition, the chunk-hopping mechanism allows the SAA to have only a 2.5%
relative CER degradation with a 320ms latency. After jointly training with a
self-attention network language model, our SAA model obtains further error rate
reduction on multiple datasets. Especially, it achieves 24.12% CER on the
Mandarin ASR benchmark (HKUST), exceeding the best end-to-end model by over 2%
absolute CER.

of interest and to improve the classification therein. In our method we make
use of well-established concepts from the field of machine learning like kernel
support vector machines and kernel ridge regression. From a comparison with a
Kriging-based exploration approach based on recently published results we can
show the advantages of our algorithm in a binary feasibility classification
scenario with a discrete feasibility constraint violation. In this context, we

propose a simple approach to approximate the SIR meta distribution for
non-Poisson networks based on the ASAPPP (""approximate SIR analysis based on

$G_0$ between its standard success probability and that for the Poisson point
process exactly characterizes the gap between the $b$th moment of the

$G_0$ allows two simple approximations of the meta distribution for general
HCNs: 1) the per-tier approximation by applying the shift $G_0$ to each tier
and 2) the effective gain approximation by directly shifting the meta
distribution for the homogeneous independent Poisson network. Given the
generality of the model considered and the fine-grained nature of the meta

that these ocean-interior turbulence estimates are from short-lived (less than

the turbulence inertial subrange is found to extend into the internal wave
band, the overturns are predominantly driven by shear associated with inertial

sub-inertial frequencies during the Meddy passage, suggesting wave trapping in
the warm anti-cyclonic eddy and/or weakly stratified layers. The observations

divided by phase space does not have a clear peak above the $D\bar{D}$

$D^0\bar{D}^0$, $D_s\bar{D}_s$, and $\eta\eta$, with some of the interactions
taken from a theoretical model, and use the data to fix other parameters. We
then show that, given the poor quality of the data, we can get different fits
leading to very different $D\bar{D}$ amplitudes, some of them supporting a
$D\bar{D}$ bound state and others not. The main conclusion is that the claim
for the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ state, already included in the PDG, is premature, but
refined data can provide very valuable information on the $D\bar{D}$ scattering
amplitude. As side effects, we warn about the use of a Breit-Wigner amplitude
parameterization close to threshold, and show that the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ channel
plays an important role in this reaction.

two-phase flow is described by the time-dependent incompressible Navier--Stokes

equation in a time-dependent domain. The arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian~(ALE)
formulation with finite elements is used to solve the governing equations in
the time-dependent domain. The interface-resolved moving meshes in ALE allows
to incorporate the interfacial tension force and jumps in the material
parameters accurately. An one-level Local Projection Stabilization~(LPS), which
is based on an enriched approximation space and a discontinuous projection
space, where both spaces are defined on a same mesh is used to stabilize the
model equations. The stabilized numerical scheme allows us to use equal order
interpolation spaces for the velocity and the viscoelastic stress, whereas
inf-sup stable finite elements are used for the velocity and the pressure. A
comprehensive numerical investigation is performed for a Newtonian bubble
rising in a viscoelastic fluid and a viscoelastic bubble rising in a Newtonian

to the formulation of an Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA)-like criterion at

within the Stoner band model. The spin-charge dynamics in the system is then
modeled by a set of diffusive equations with the contributions from
spin-dependent surface screening ands spin-dependent conductivity. We show for
MgO-Cu-Co-MgO system that the spin-dependent screening in thin Co film produces
spin accumulation 7 times higher than that obtained by the spin-dependent
conductivity in thick Co films. We propose an experimental approach to validate
our numerical predictions and to distinguish between spin accumulation induced
by the spin-dependent conductivity and by the spin-dependent surface screening.

the particle number symmetry, a precise description of phenomena like the
particle transfer during heavy-ion reactions can only be achieved by
considering systems with good particle numbers. We investigate the possibility
to restore particle number in many-body dynamical problems by mixing-up several
Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Bogolyubov (TDHFB) trajectories. In our approach,
each trajectory is independent from the others and the quantum mixing between
trajectories is deduced from a variational principle. The associated theory can
be seen as a simplified version of the Multi-Configuration TDHFB (MC-TDHFB)
theory. Its accuracy to tackle the problem of symmetry restoration in dynamical
problems is illustrated for the case of two superfluid systems that exchange
particles during a short time. In Ref. [Phys. Rev. C 97, 034627 (2018)], using
a schematic model where two systems initially described by a pairing
Hamiltonians are coupled during a short contact time, it was demonstrated that
statistical mixing of TDHFB trajectories can only qualitatively describe the
transfer process and that a fully quantum treatment is mandatory. We show here
that the present MC-TDHFB approach gives an excellent agreement with the exact
solution when the two superfluids are the same (symmetric case) or different
(asymmetric case) and from weak to strong interaction strength. Finally, we
discuss the benefits and bottleneck of this method in view of its application
to realistic systems.

with many models, especially with Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). Instead,
posterior approximations are often sought. Unfortunately, when posterior
approximations are used, prior-focused approaches do not succeed in evaluations
designed to capture properties of realistic continual learning use cases. As an
alternative to prior-focused methods, we introduce a new approximate Bayesian
derivation of the continual learning loss. Our loss does not rely on the
posterior from earlier tasks, and instead adapts the model itself by changing
the likelihood term. We call these approaches likelihood-focused. We then
combine prior- and likelihood-focused methods into one objective, tying the two

bipartite graphical model that jointly learns a probability distribution over
data and extracts their relevant statistical features. As such, RBM were
recently proposed for characterizing the patterns of coevolution between amino
acids in protein sequences and for designing new sequences. Here, we study how
the nature of the features learned by RBM changes with its defining parameters,
such as the dimensionality of the representations (size of the hidden layer)
and the sparsity of the features. We show that for adequate values of these
parameters, RBM operate in a so-called compositional phase in which visible
configurations sampled from the RBM are obtained by recombining these features.
We then compare the performance of RBM with other standard representation
learning algorithms, including Principal or Independent Component Analysis,
autoencoders (AE), variational auto-encoders (VAE), and their sparse variants.
We show that RBM, due to the stochastic mapping between data configurations and
representations, better capture the underlying interactions in the system and
are significantly more robust with respect to sample size than deterministic
methods such as PCA or ICA. In addition, this stochastic mapping is not
prescribed a priori as in VAE, but learned from data, which allows RBM to show
good performance even with shallow architectures. All numerical results are
illustrated on synthetic lattice-protein data, that share similar statistical
features with real protein sequences, and for which ground-truth interactions
are known.

  elliptic operators and of products of second order operators","Major revision: Sections 2,3,5 are new and the main results of v1 are
  improved",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study fundamental solutions of elliptic operators of order $2m\geq4$ with
constant coefficients in large dimensions $n\ge 2m$, where their singularities
become unbounded. For compositions of second order operators these can be
chosen as convolution products of positive singular functions, which are
positive themselves. As soon as $n\geq3$, the polyharmonic operator
$(-\Delta)^m$ may no longer serve as a prototype for the general elliptic
operator. It is known from examples of [V.G. Maz'ya, S. A. Nazarov, Math. Notes
39 (1986); Transl. of Mat. Zametki 39 (1986)] and [E.B. Davies, Journal Differ.
Equations 135 (1997)] that in dimensions $n\ge 2m+3$ fundamental solutions of
specific operators of order $2m\geq4$ may change sign near their singularities:
there are ``positive'' as well as ``negative'' directions along which the
fundamental solution tends to $+\infty$ and $-\infty$ respectively, when
approaching its pole. In order to understand this phenomenon systematically we
first show that existence of a ``positive'' direction directly follows from the
ellipticity of the operator. We establish an inductive argument by space
dimension which shows that sign change in some dimension implies sign change in
any larger dimension for suitably constructed operators. Moreover, we deduce
for $n=2m$, $n=2m+2$ and for all odd dimensions an explicit closed expression
for the fundamental solution in terms of its symbol. From such formulae it
becomes clear that the sign of the fundamental solution for such operators
depends on the dimension. Indeed, we show that we have even sign change for a
suitable operator of order $2m$ in dimension $n=2m+2$. On the other hand we
show that in the dimensions $n=2m$ and $n=2m+1$ the fundamental solution of any
such elliptic operator is always positive around its singularity.

with core levels close in energy are studied theoretically and experimentally.
The Coulomb transitions of a hole between such levels lead to a resonant
enhancement of the Auger spectra (with respect to the energy difference between
the levels). Interatomic Auger transitions involving high lying levels are
formed by shaking up electrons due to the dynamic field of photo holes produced
during the transition. These effects were observed experimentally in XPS and
Auger spectra of CuInSe2 type materials.

Learning algorithms for prediction of some rock properties which geoscientists
usually define due to special lab analysis. We demonstrate that these special
properties can be predicted only basing on routine core analysis (RCA) data. To
validate the approach core samples from the reservoir with soluble rock matrix
components (salts) were tested within 100+ laboratory experiments. The
challenge of the experiments was to characterize the rate of salts in cores and
alteration of porosity and permeability after reservoir desalination due to
drilling mud or water injection. For these three measured characteristics, we
developed the relevant predictive models, which were based on the results of
RCA and data on coring depth and top and bottom depths of productive horizons.
To select the most accurate Machine Learning algorithm a comparative analysis
has been performed. It was shown that different algorithms work better in
different models. However, two hidden layers Neural network has demonstrated
the best predictive ability and generalizability for all three rock
characteristics jointly. The other algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine
and Linear Regression, also worked well on the dataset, but in particular
cases. Overall, the applied approach allows predicting the alteration of
porosity and permeability during desalination in porous rocks and also
evaluating salt concentration without direct measurements in a laboratory. This
work also shows that developed approaches could be applied for prediction of
other rock properties (residual brine and oil saturations, relative
permeability, capillary pressure, and others), which laboratory measurements
are time-consuming and expensive.

improve the performance for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning under two
application scenarios: 1) classical multi-agent reinforcement learning with
direct message communication among agents and 2) centralized training with
decentralized execution. In the first application scenario of multi-agent
systems in which direct message communication among agents is allowed, the
message-dropout technique drops out the received messages from other agents in
a block-wise manner with a certain probability in the training phase and
compensates for this effect by multiplying the weights of the dropped-out block
units with a correction probability. The applied message-dropout technique
effectively handles the increased input dimension in multi-agent reinforcement
learning with communication and makes learning robust against communication
errors in the execution phase. In the second application scenario of
centralized training with decentralized execution, we particularly consider the
application of the proposed message-dropout to Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (MADDPG), which uses a centralized critic to train a
decentralized actor for each agent. We evaluate the proposed message-dropout
technique for several games, and numerical results show that the proposed
message-dropout technique with proper dropout rate improves the reinforcement
learning performance significantly in terms of the training speed and the
steady-state performance in the execution phase.

acyclic polyenes as a weak and essentially local delocalization of
initially-localized pairs of electrons ascribed to individual double bonds
(instead of formation of a completely delocalized electron system as usual). To
this end, polyenes are modelled as sets of weakly interacting formally-double
bonds, where the single bonds represent the interaction between the former and
are treated as a perturbation. Mathematically, the above-formulated goal is
realized by means of a particular version of the non-canonical method of
molecular orbitals (MOs) based on the Brillouin theorem and yielding the
expressions both for total energies and for non-canonical (localized) MOs
(NCMOs) directly without any reference to usual (canonical) MOs. In addition,
total energies and NCMOs are interrelated explicitly in the approach applied,
viz. the former are representable via the so-called delocalization coefficients
of the latter. Adaptation of these general results to the above-specified model
of polyene yields coincidence between the conjugation energy (CE) and the total
delocalization energy of all pairs of electrons contained. Moreover, a local
relation follows between constitution of the nearest environment of a certain
bond, delocalization pattern of the respective pair of electrons and
contribution of just this pair to the total CE of the given polyene. As a
result, different stabilities of distinct polyenes (e.g. of isomers) prove to
be accompanied by variable extents of delocalization of separate pairs of
electrons. Linear and cross-conjugated polyene chains are comparatively
analyzed.

variant of data poisoning attacks. Trojan attacks exploit an effective backdoor
created in a DNN model by leveraging the difficulty in interpretability of the
learned model to misclassify any inputs signed with the attacker's chosen
trojan trigger. Since the trojan trigger is a secret guarded and exploited by
the attacker, detecting such trojan inputs is a challenge, especially at
run-time when models are in active operation. This work builds STRong
Intentional Perturbation (STRIP) based run-time trojan attack detection system
and focuses on vision system. We intentionally perturb the incoming input, for
instance by superimposing various image patterns, and observe the randomness of
predicted classes for perturbed inputs from a given deployed model---malicious
or benign. A low entropy in predicted classes violates the input-dependence
property of a benign model and implies the presence of a malicious input---a
characteristic of a trojaned input. The high efficacy of our method is
validated through case studies on three popular and contrasting datasets:
MNIST, CIFAR10 and GTSRB. We achieve an overall false acceptance rate (FAR) of
less than 1%, given a preset false rejection rate (FRR) of 1%, for different
types of triggers. Using CIFAR10 and GTSRB, we have empirically achieved result
of 0% for both FRR and FAR. We have also evaluated STRIP robustness against a
number of trojan attack variants and adaptive attacks.

one could assess the status of the essential elements required for conducting

the research has focused on less-resourced and minority languages, it concludes
that DHuRAF has the potential to be generalized in a variety of different

The model is characterized by an energy displaying both elastic and surface

epitaxially-strained thin films to crystalline cavities, and from capillarity
problems to fracture models.
  Existence of minimizing configurations is established by adopting the direct

sequences and energy lower semicontinuity are shown with respect to a proper
selected topology in a class of admissible configurations that extends the
classes previously considered in the literature. In particular, graph-like

have become possible only recently, and have discovered, in particular, that
the value of the observed thermal conductance of the 5/2 state is not
consistent with either the Pfaffian or the anti-Pfaffian model, motivating
several theoretical articles. The analysis of the experiments has been made
complicated by the presence of counter-propagating edge channels arising from
edge reconstruction, an inevitable consequence of separating the dopant layer
from the GaAs quantum well. In particular, it has been found that the universal
quantization requires thermalization of downstream and upstream edge channels.
Here we measure the thermal conductance in hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated
graphene devices of sizes much smaller than the thermal relaxation length of
the edge states. We find the quantization of thermal conductance within 5%

used hole transport layer
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with a
better hole-selective polyarylamine. As a result, these cells exhibit superior
operation under reduced light conditions, which we demonstrate for the extreme
case of moonlight irradiance, at which open-circuit voltages of 530 mV can
still be obtained. By the shunt removal we also observe the VOC to drop to zero
after as long as 2 h after the light has been switched off. Second, at higher
illumination intensities the dominant losses in the PEDOT:PSS-based cell are
ascribed to surface recombination and are also proven to be substantially
minimized by instead employing the polyarylamine. We attribute the reduced
shunt and surface recombination to the far better suited semiconductor
character of the polyarylamine, compared to that of PEDOT:PSS, efficiently
blocking electrons from recombining at this electrode.

believed that in the presence of interactions the Hall conductivity is given by
the same expression, in which the noninteracting two - point Green function is

Besides, we extend our consideration to the $3+1$ D Weyl semimetals. It was
known previously that with the interactions neglected the Hall conductivity in
those systems is expressed through the two - point Green function in the way
similar to that of the $2+1$ D topological insulators. Again, the influence of

call the ""social phenotype"" of diseases. Materials and methods: In this paper
we present a data analytic framework to represent, extract and analyze the

presents a detailed case study on diabetes. First, we create a high quality
data sample of diabetic patients' messages, extracted from popular medical
forums during more than 10 years. Next, we use a topic extraction techniques

on the patients' quality of life. In our case study on diabetes, we found that
issues reported to have a daily impact on diabetic patients are diet, glycemic
control, drugs and clinical tests. These problems are not commonly considered

median-combined to for a high-quality light curve without temporal local
brightness variations. Stellar specific intensities are extracted from this
light curve using a model-free method. We search individual light curves for

SST, $\mathcal{F}_B < 0$ due to its stable nature; consequently, the kinetic
energy flux $\Pi_u(k)$ decreases with wavenumber $k$ that leads to a steep
kinetic energy spectrum, $E_u(k) \sim k^{-11/5}$. Turbulent convection is
unstable, hence $\mathcal{F}_B > 0$ that leads to an increase of $\Pi_u(k)$
with $k$; this increase however is marginal due to relatively weak buoyancy,

crystalline films deposited on substrates is performed by $\Gamma$-convergence.
The discrete model here introduced is characterized by an energy with two
contributions, the surface and the elastic-bulk energy, and it is formally
justified starting from atomistic interactions. The surface energy counts
missing bonds at the film and substrate boundaries, while the elastic energy
models the fact that for film atoms there is a preferred interatomic distance
different from the preferred interatomic distance for substrate atoms. In the
regime of small mismatches between the film and the substrate optimal lattices,
a discrete rigidity estimate is established by regrouping the elastic energy in
triangular-cell energies and by locally applying rigidity estimates from the
literature. This is crucial to establish pre-compactness for sequences with
equibounded energy and to prove that the limiting deformation is one single
rigid motion. By properly matching the convergence scaling of the different
terms in the discrete energy, both surface and elastic contributions appear
also in the resulting continuum limit in agreement (and in a form consistent)

sleep experts investigate sleep-related events and consider the transition
rules between the found events. Similarly, IITNet extracts representative
features at a sub-epoch level by a residual neural network and captures intra-

bidirectional LSTM. The performance was investigated for three datasets as the
sequence length (L) increased from one to ten. IITNet achieved the comparable
performance with other state-of-the-art results. The best accuracy, MF1, and
Cohen's kappa ($\kappa$) were 83.9%, 77.6%, 0.78 for SleepEDF (L=10), 86.5%,

improvement was not significant. The results support that considering the

the experiments with the baselines showed that introducing intra-epoch temporal

weak memory model of C/C++, libraries may suffer from vulnerabilities which can
expose the applications to potential attacks. For example, a very large number
of return oriented programming gadgets exist in glibc that allow stitching
together semantically valid but malicious Turing-complete programs. In spite of
significant advances in attack detection and mitigation, full defense is
unrealistic against an ever-growing set of possibilities for generating such
malicious programs.
  In this work, we create a defense mechanism by debloating libraries to reduce
the dynamic functions linked so that the possibilities of constructing
malicious programs diminishes significantly. The key idea is to locate each
library call site within an application, and in each case to load only the set
of library functions that will be used at that call site. This approach of
demand-driven loading relies on an input-aware oracle that predicts a
near-exact set of library functions needed at a given call site during the
execution. The predicted functions are loaded just in time, and the complete
call chain (of function bodies) inside the library is purged after returning
from the library call back into the application. We present a decision-tree
based predictor, which acts as an oracle, and an optimized runtime system,
which works directly with library binaries like GNU libc and libstdc++. We show
that on average, the proposed scheme cuts the exposed code surface of libraries
by 97.2%, reduces ROP gadgets present in linked libraries by 97.9%, achieves a
prediction accuracy in most cases of at least 97%, and adds a small runtime
overhead of 18% on all libraries (16% for glibc, 2% for others) across all

entropy is carried by superhorizon modes of the metric. It can be directly
estimated from the partition function as $S=\log Z$ in Liouville gravity. We
formulate a gravitational Fokker-Planck equation to elucidate the Brownian

independent tensors we study if the rank of their direct sum is equal to the
sum of their individual ranks. A positive answer to this problem was previously
known as Strassen's conjecture until recent counterexamples were proposed by
Shitov. The latter are not very explicit, and they are only known to exist
asymptotically for very large tensor spaces. In this article we prove that for
some small three-way tensors the additivity holds. For instance, if the rank of
one of the tensors is at most 6, then the additivity holds. Or, if one of the
tensors lives in $C^k \otimes C^3 \otimes C^3$ for any $k$, then the additivity
also holds. More generally, if one of the tensors is concise and its rank is at
most 2 more than the dimension of one of the linear spaces, then additivity
holds. In addition we also treat some cases of the additivity of border rank of
such tensors. In particular, we show that the additivity of the border rank
holds if the direct sum tensor is contained in $C^4 \otimes C^4 \otimes C^4$.

broken-symmetry order parameter that is presumed to exist in the strongly
correlated electron system URu2Si2 on the basis of the reported similarity of
the heat capacity at its phase transition at To~17 K to that produced by
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean field theory. Here we show that the phase
boundary in URu2Si2 has the elliptical form expected for an entropy-driven
phase transition, as has been shown to accompany a change in valence. We show
one characteristic feature of such a transition is that the ratio of the
critical magnetic field to the critical temperature is defined solely in terms
of the effective quasiparticle g-factor, which we find to be in quantitative
agreement with prior g-factor measurements. We further find the anomaly in the
heat capacity at To to be significantly sharper than a BCS phase transition,
and, once quasiparticle excitations across the hybridization gap are taken into
consideration, loses its resemblance to a second order phase transition. Our
findings imply that a change in valence dominates the thermodynamics of the
phase boundary in URu2Si2, and eclipses any significant contribution to the
thermodynamics from a hidden order parameter.

state of $^{12}$C in the resonating group method or the generator coordinate
method, a superposition of the orientations of Wheeler's triangular cluster on
the cluster plane would naturally generate an intrinsic toroidal density. A
toroidal state also has a probability amplitude to overlap with a 3-alpha
cluster, which is the dominant decay mode for the Hoyle state. For these
reasons, we study a toroidal description of the states of $^{12}$C in the
toroidal configuration both phenomenologically and microscopically. A toroidal
$^{12}$C nucleus distinguishes itself by toroidal particle-hole multiplet
excitations between one toroidal single-particle shell to another. From such a
signature and experimental data, we find phenomenologically that the Hoyle
state and many of its higher excited states may be tentatively attributed to
those of the $^{12}$C nucleus in a toroidal configuration. We then study the
$^{12}$C system from a microscopic mean-field approximation using variational
wave functions. We find that the equidensity surfaces of the $^{12}$C ground
state exhibit a dense toroidal core immersed in lower-density oblate spheroids
in the surface region. Furthermore, there are prominent toroidal features of
the equidensity surfaces for the state at the Hoyle excitation energy, at which
previous cluster model calculations indicate the presence of a 3-alpha cluster
state. A toroidal coexistence model therefore may emerge to suggest the
possibility that the physical Hoyle state may have probability amplitudes to be
in the toroidal configuration and the 3-alpha cluster configuration.

socio-semantic network analyses to examine how cultural homophily works when
field logic meets practice. On the one hand, because individuals in similar
field positions are also imposed with similar cultural orientations, cultural
homophily reproduces objective field structure in intersubjective social
network ties. On the other hand, fields are operative in practice and to
accomplish pragmatic goals individuals who occupy different field positions
often join in groups, creatively reinterpret the field-imposed cultural
orientations, and produce cultural similarities alternative to the
position-specific ones. Drawing on these emergent similarities, the cultural
homophily mechanism might stimulate social network ties between members who
occupy not the same but different field positions, thus contesting fields. I
examine this ambivalent role of cultural homophily in two creative collectives,
each embracing members positioned closer to the opposite poles of the field of
cultural production. I find different types of cultural similarities to affect
different types of social network ties within and between the field positions:
Similarity of vocabularies stimulates friendship and collaboration ties within
positions, thus reproducing the field, while affiliation with the same cultural
structures stimulates collaboration ties between positions, thus contesting the
field. The latter effect is visible under statistical analysis of ethnographic
data, but easy to oversee in qualitative analysis of texts because informants
tend to flag conformity to their positions in their explicit statements. This
highlights the importance of mixed socio-semantic network analysis, both
sensitive to the local context and capable of unveiling the mechanisms
underlying the interplay between the cultural and the social.

on $Y$ is weakly contained in a Bernoulli shift. This subgroup is also the
minimal subgroup so that any action weakly contained in a Bernoulli shift is
$G\curvearrowright X/Y$-ergodic ""in the presence of $G\curvearrowright X$"". We
give several applications, including a major simplification of the proof that
measure entropy equals topological entropy for principal algebraic actions
whose associated convolution operator is injective. We also deduce from our
techniques that algebraic actions whose square summable homoclinic group is
dense have completely positive entropy when the acting group is sofic.

understanding the AHE mechanism has been challenging and largely restricted to
ferromagnetic metals. Here, we investigate the recently discovered AHE in the

an anomalous thermal Hall effect (ATHE). The amplitude of the ATHE scales with
the anomalous Hall conductivity of Mn3Sn over a wide temperature range,
demonstrating that the AHE of Mn3Sn arises from a dissipationless intrinsic
mechanism associated with the Berry curvature. Moreover, we find that the
dissipationless AHE is significantly stabilized by shifting the Fermi level
toward the magnetic Weyl points. Thus, in Mn3Sn, the Berry curvature emerging
from the proposed magnetic Weyl fermion state is a key factor for the observed
AHE and ATHE.

results of a Monte Carlo interplanetary transport model, combined with a full

the 300-800 keV nominal energy channel. Unlike previous studies, we have
considered both the energy and angular responses of the detector. This method
allowed us to infer the electron release time profile at the source and
determine the electron interplanetary transport conditions. We discuss the
duration of the release time profiles and the values of the radial mean free
path, and compare them with the values reported previously in the literature
using earlier approaches. Five of the events show short injection histories
(<30 min) at the Sun and ten events show long-lasting (>30 min) injections. The
values of mean free path range from 0.02 AU to 0.27 AU. The inferred injection
histories match with the radio and soft x-ray emissions found in literature. We
find no dependence of the radial mean free path on the radial distance. In
addition, we find no apparent relation between the strength of interplanetary
scattering and the size of the solar particle release.

  In the first part, we use the DFT+$U$ method, to calculate the equilibrium
phase transitions of LuNiO$_3$ as an example of rare-earth nickelates under a
substrate-induced strain, and the nonequilibrium phase transitions of VO$_2$ as
an example of narrow-gap Mott insulators under laser-pulse-induced

the change of band structure in response to the change of orbital occupancies
of electrons, i.e., the soft band effect. This effect brings about competitions
of electrons between different orbitals and gives rise to multiple metastable
states.

density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method based on matrix product
states (MPS) to perform real-time evolutions of the Anderson impurity model,
towards the goal of building a real-time impurity solver for the nonequilibrium

${\cal Q}=0$ as a signature of string theory. In the Racetrack K\""ahler uplift
model, where $P(\Lambda)$ of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ peaks sharply
at $\Lambda=0$, the electroweak scale (not the electroweak model) naturally
emerges when the median $\Lambda$ is matched to the observed value. We check
the robustness of this scenario. In a bottom-up approach, we find that the
observed quark and charged lepton masses are consistent with the same
probabilistic philosophy, with distribution $P(m)$ that diverges at $m=0$, with
the same (or almost the same) degree of divergence. This suggests that the
Standard Model has an underlying string theory description, and yields
relations among the fermion masses, albeit in a probabilistic approach (very
different from the usual sense). Along this line of reasoning, the normal
hierarchy of neutrino masses is clearly preferred over the inverted hierarchy,
and the sum of the neutrino masses is predicted to be $\sum m_{\nu} \simeq
0.0592$ eV, with an upper bound $\sum m_{\nu} <0.066$ eV. This illustrates a
novel way string theory can be applied to particle physics phenomenology.

of pump in Tm-doped fiber laser. A pulsed laser technique, unlike Q-switching
and gain-switching, is explored under the equilibrium between the stimulated
emission and absorption. After the laser reaching a CW steady state, the
temporal fluctuation of pump power is called power adiabatic evolution if it
does not break the balance between the stimulated emission and the absorption.
Under the pump power adiabatic evolution the population densities in the upper
and lower laser levels get clamped to their steady-state values, and the
temporal shape of output laser is identical with that of pump. Based on the
power adiabatic evolution of pump a laser pulse can therefore be generated by a
pulsed pump which is added to a CW pump. Moreover, the temporal profile,
duration and peak power of the laser pulse can all be precisely controlled.
Power adiabatic evolution of pump can be achieved in the three pumping shemes
of Tm-doped fiber laser, provided that the duration of pump pulse is broader
than a certain value. The study on the pulsing mechanism highlights an

generate large magnetic dipole-dipole interaction with electron spins in
organic semiconductors (OSECs). This concept could be considered analogous to
the effect of hyperfine interaction (HFI). In order to investigate this model,
Fe3O4 MNPs are used as a dopant for generating random hyperfine-like magnetic
fields in a HFI-dominant {\pi}-conjugated polymer host,
poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MeH-PPV). The
magnetoconductance (MC) response in organic light emitting diodes made by
MeH-PPV/MNP blends is used to estimate the effective hyperfine field in the
blends. Firstly, we find that the shape of the MC response essentially remains
the same regardless of the MNP concentration, which is attributed to the
similar functionality between the nuclear spins and the MNPs. Secondly, the
width of MC increases with increasing MNP concentration. Magneto-optical Kerr
effect experiments and micromagnetic simulation indicate that the additional
increase of the MC width is associated with the strength of the magnetization
of the blend. Finally, the MC broadening has the same temperature dependent
trend as the magnetization of the MNPs where the unique effect of the MNPs in
their superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic regimes on the MC response is
observed. Magneto-photoinduced absorption (MPA) spectroscopy confirms that the
MC broadening is not due to defects introduced by the MNPs, but is a result of
unique superparamagnetic behavior. Our study yields a new pathway for tuning
OSECs' magnetic functionality, which is essential to organic optoelectronic

a local passive eavesdropper to infer the victim's activity, even when the

deep-learning classifier, a WF attacker can gain over 98% accuracy on Tor
traffic. In this paper, we explore a novel defense, Mockingbird, based on the
idea of adversarial examples that have been shown to undermine machine-learning
classifiers in other domains. Since the attacker gets to design and train his
attack classifier based on the defense, we first demonstrate that at a
straightforward technique for generating adversarial-example based traces fails
to protect against an attacker using adversarial training for robust
classification. We then propose Mockingbird, a technique for generating traces
that resists adversarial training by moving randomly in the space of viable
traces and not following more predictable gradients. The technique drops the
accuracy of the state-of-the-art attack hardened with adversarial training from
98% to 42-58% while incurring only 58% bandwidth overhead. The attack accuracy
is generally lower than state-of-the-art defenses, and much lower when
considering Top-2 accuracy, while incurring lower bandwidth overheads.

simple exponential law even in the case of ideal fermions due to the finite
size of the simulation box. Moreover, we introduce a permutation-cycle

simultaneously find cycles of different lengths within a single configuration.
Again, we find that finite-size effects predominate the observed behaviour.

duplex multi-cell multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with active eavesdropping. We assume that the eavesdropper actively
attacks the uplink pilot transmission and the uplink data transmission before
eavesdropping the downlink data transmission of the users. We exploit both the
received pilots and the received data signals for uplink channel estimation. We
show analytically that when the number of transmit antennas and the length of
the data vector both tend to infinity, the signals of the desired user and the
eavesdropper lie in different eigenspaces of the received signal matrix at the
base station provided that their signal powers are different. This finding
reveals that decreasing (instead of increasing) the desired user's signal power
might be an effective approach to combat a strong active attack from an
eavesdropper. Inspired by this observation, we propose a data-aided secure
downlink transmission scheme and derive an asymptotic achievable secrecy
sum-rate expression for the proposed design. For the special case of a
single-cell single-user system with independent and identically distributed
fading, the obtained expression reveals that the secrecy rate scales
logarithmically with the number of transmit antennas. This is the same scaling
law as for the achievable rate of a single-user massive MIMO system in the
absence of eavesdroppers. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme
achieves significant secrecy rate gains compared to alternative approaches
based on matched filter precoding with artificial noise generation and null

cloud servers as well as supercomputers, are constrained by two main
conflicting requirements: IT power consumption generated by the computing nodes
and the heat that must be removed to avoid thermal hazards. In the worst cases,
up to 60% of the energy consumed in a data center is used for cooling, often
related to an over-designed cooling system. We propose a low-cost and
battery-supplied wireless sensor network (WSN) for fine-grained, flexible and
long-term data center temperature monitoring. The WSN has been operational
collecting more than six million data points, with no losses, for six months
without battery recharges. Our work reaches a 300x better energy efficiency
than the previously reported WSNs for similar scenarios and on a 7x wider area.
The data collected by the network can be used to optimize cooling effort while
avoiding dangerous hot spots.

measurements simultaneously with CIGALE using variable attenuation laws based
on flexible recipes. Both studies conclude to a large variety of effective
attenuation laws with an attenuation law flattening when the obscuration
increases. An extra attenuation is found for nebular lines. The comparison with
radiative transfer models implies a flattening of the attenuation law up to
near infrared wavelengths, which is well reproduced with a power-laws recipe
inspired by the Charlot and Fall recipe. Here we propose a global modification
of the Calzetti attenuation law to better reproduce the results of radiative

applications. However, the high number of end devices expected in at-scale

challenge the scalability of this standard. In this paper, we present an
approach to increase network throughput through a Slotted-ALOHA overlay on
LoRaWAN networks. To increase the single channel capacity, we propose to
regulate the communication of LoRaWAN networks using a Slotted-ALOHA variant on
the top of the Pure-ALOHA approach used by the standard; thus, no modification
in pre-existing libraries is necessary. Our method is based on an innovative
synchronization service that is suitable for low-cost wireless sensor nodes. We
modelled the LoRaWAN channel with extensive measurement on hardware platforms,
and we quantified the impact of tuning parameters on physical and medium access
control layers, as well as the packet collision rate. Results show that
Slotted-ALOHA supported by our synchronization service significantly improves
the performance of traditional LoRaWAN networks regarding packet loss rate and
network throughput.

  (TELECOM)","Diagnostics of GNSS-based Virtual Balise in Railway Using Embedded
  Odometry and Track Geometry",,"Institute of Navigation International Technical Meeting 2019, Jan
  2019, Reston, VA, United States",,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of GNSS in the railway sector has been postulated on the notion of a
Virtual Balise (VB). The VB-based positioning system works by setting a VB
point on the railway track and determining the passage of the VB point using
the position solution from the GNSS receiver. Although augmentation systems
such as SBAS or GBAS are able to satisfy the integrity requirements of the
aviation standards down to the 10-7 level, it is difficult to satisfy the high
integrity requirements of the railway sector because firstly the railway users
located on the ground are affected by the ground environment such as terrain,
buildings and tunnels and secondly because the stringency of the railway sector
requirements extends below the 10-9 level. This paper proposes a method to
detect faults in the GNSS solution due to satellite failure or local effects.
Firstly, requirements for the monitoring performance are carefully derived
accounting for the specificities of GNSS, namely that the possibility of
consecutive VB faults cannot be discounted. The second contribution of the
paper is the proposed detection using both odometry and track geometry of the
onboard system. This enables to monitor all three-dimensional solution error so
that higher sensitivity for the fault detection can be achieved. Simulations
have been performed with both single and dual (GPS, GALILEO) solutions. It has
been found that the combinations of metrics are able to achieve very small
missed detection probabilities for mean failure rates from 5.0m/s down to
0.03m/s for most dual constellation geometries. The detection performance of
the odometer implementation varied according to the heading of the train. On
the other hand, when odometry and track geometry are used together, all the
three-directional monitors can obtain stable results regardless of the heading.

is usually stored in some representation, which can be referred to as a map.
Conventionally, most maps are built upon hand-crafted features. Recently,
neural networks have attracted attention as a data-driven map representation,
and have shown promising results in visual localization. However, these neural
network maps are generally hard to interpret by human. A readable map is not
only accessible to humans, but also provides a way to be verified when the
ground truth pose is unavailable. To tackle this problem, we propose Generative
Map, a new framework for learning human-readable neural network maps, by
combining a generative model with the Kalman filter, which also allows it to
incorporate additional sensor information such as stereo visual odometry. For
evaluation, we use real world images from the 7-Scenes and Oxford RobotCar
datasets. We demonstrate that our Generative Map can be queried with a pose of
interest from the test sequence to predict an image, which closely resembles
the true scene. For localization, we show that Generative Map achieves
comparable performance with current regression models. Moreover, our framework
is trained completely from scratch, unlike regression models which rely on
large ImageNet pretrained networks.

in the dynamics of small systems, focusing on azimuthal correlations at
different multiplicities. To this end we introduce a new model, matching the
classical Yang-Mills dynamics of pre-equilibrium gluon fields (IP-GLASMA) to a
perturbative QCD based parton cascade for the final state evolution (BAMPS) on
an event-by-event basis. Depending on multiplicity of the event, we see
transverse momentum dependent signatures of the initial, but also the final
state in azimuthal correlation observables, such as $v_2\left\lbrace
2PC\right\rbrace(p_T)$. In low-multiplicity events, initial state correlations
dominate for transverse momenta $p_T>2~\mathrm{GeV}$, whereas in
high-multiplicity events and at low momenta final state interactions dominate
and initial state correlations strongly affect $v_2\left\lbrace
2PC\right\rbrace(p_T)$ for $p_T>2~\mathrm{GeV}$ as well as the $p_T$ integrated
$v_2\left\lbrace 2PC\right\rbrace$. Nearly half of the final pT integrated
$v_2\left\lbrace 2PC\right\rbrace$ is contributed by the initial state in
low-multiplicity events, whereas in high-multiplicity the share is much less.
Based on Ref. [1], we are now able to carry out a systematic multiplicity scan,
probing the dynamics on the border of initial state dominated to final state
dominated - but not yet hydrodynamic regime.
