communications systems often relies upon idealized antenna characteristic,
where the side-lobe gain of UAVs' antenna is ignored. In practice, however,
side-lobe cause inevitable interference to the ground users. We investigate the
impact of UAVs' antenna side-lobe on the performance of UAV-enabled
communication. Our analysis shows that even for a very small antenna's
side-lobe gain, the ground receiver can experience substantial interference. We
further show that a rather large exclusion zone is required to ensure a
sufficient level of protection for the ground receiver. Nevertheless, in a
multiple-antenna setting for the ground users, even when such a large exclusion
zone was in place, UAVs' antenna side-lobe creates a high level of correlation
among the interference signals received across receive antennas. Such a
correlation limits the system ability to exploit channel diversity in a
multiple-antenna setting for improving capacity. We then quantify the impact of
UAVs' antenna side-lobes on the overall system performance by deriving the
corresponding loss of the achieved capacity in various communications
environments. We provide a new quantitative insight on the cost of adopting
non-ideal UAV antenna on the overall capacity. Our analysis also shows that the
capacity loss can be confined by careful selection of system parameters.

incorporation of UAV-mounted BSs (U-BS) poses on the coverage probability of
cellular networks. To this end, we focus on the evaluation of the coverage

the coverage probability based on main system parameters and percentage of BSs
in each tier that are aerial. We confirm the accuracy of our analysis. Using
our analysis, we observe that for several common communication environments,
e.g., high-rise and dense urban environments, the inclusion of U-BSs can be
detrimental to the coverage probability. Nevertheless, it is still possible to
minimize the coverage cost by turning off a percentage of G-BSs. Interestingly,
for urban and sub-urban areas one can adjust the altitude of U-BSs in order to
increase the coverage probability.

the streamwise and spanwise permeabilities. This linear regime breaks down for
a critical value of the wall-normal permeability, beyond which the performance
begins to degrade. We observe that the degradation is associated with the
appearance of spanwise-coherent structures, attributed to a
Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instability of the mean flow. This feature is common to a
variety of obstructed flows, and linear stability analysis can be used to
predict it. For large permeabilities, these structures become prevalent in the

increase of drag. For the substrate configurations considered, the largest drag

linguistics approaches, and the mathematical theory of hypernetworks, where
elementary units are aggregated into high-level entities. In this line of
thought, a narrative is understood as a social construct where a related and
coherent aggregate of terms within public discourse is repeated and propagated
on media until it can be identified as a communication pattern, embodying
meaning in a way that provides individuals some interpretation of their world.
An inclusive methodology, with state-of-the-art technologies on natural

However, wave packets limited in space and time are used to transmit energy and

part of the pulsed beams propagates in free space at a variable speed,
exhibiting both subluminal and superluminal behaviours in the region close to
the source, and their velocity approaches the value of c with distance.
Although the pulse can travel over small distances faster than the speed of
light in vacuum, the average on-axis velocity, which is estimated by the
arrival time of the pulse at distances z >> ld (ld is the Rayleigh diffraction
range) and z > ct (t is the pulse width) is less than c. The total pulse beam
propagates at a constant subluminal velocity through the whole distance. The
mutual influence of the spatial distribution of radiation and temporal shape of
the pulse during nonparaxial propagation in vacuum is studied. It is found that
the decrease in the width of the incident beam and the increase in the central
wavelength of the pulse lead to a decrease in the propagation velocity of the
wave packet. It is shown that the velocities of the Bessel-Gauss and
Laguerre-Gauss pulsed beams decrease with increasing orbital angular momentum
(OAM). The results obtained are in good agreement with subluminal and
superluminal measurements in free space.

recommendation. Sequential recommenders have been successful in modeling the
dynamics of users and items over time. However, while different model
architectures excel at capturing various temporal ranges or dynamics, distinct
application contexts require adapting to diverse behaviors. In this paper we
examine how to build a model that can make use of different temporal ranges and
dynamics depending on the request context. We begin with the analysis of an
anonymized Youtube dataset comprising millions of user sequences. We quantify
the degree of long-range dependence in these sequences and demonstrate that
both short-term and long-term dependent behavioral patterns co-exist. We then
propose a neural Multi-temporal-range Mixture Model (M3) as a tailored solution
to deal with both short-term and long-term dependencies. Our approach employs a
mixture of models, each with a different temporal range. These models are
combined by a learned gating mechanism capable of exerting different model
combinations given different contextual information. In empirical evaluations
on a public dataset and our own anonymized YouTube dataset, M3 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.

  In-Plane Accelerated Simultaneous Multislice Imaging","22 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: The goal of this work is to extend the capabilities of RAKI, a
k-space interpolating neural network, to reconstruct high-quality images from
in-plane accelerated simultaneous multislice imaging acquisitions. This method
is referred to as slice-RAKI.
  Methods: A three-layer convolutional neural network was designed to output
k-space signals for separate slices given the input of a multicoil
slice-aliased k-space. The output of the slice-interpolation network is passed
into a separate in-plane interpolating network for each slice. The proposed
framework was tested in retrospective acceleration experiments in vivo, and in
prospectively accelerated phantom and in vivo experiments.
  Results: The neural network interpolation based reconstruction quantitatively
outperforms conventional parallel imaging reconstruction algorithms for all
tested in-plane and simultaneous multislice acceleration factors. Visually, the
neural network reconstructions are of superior quality compared to parallel
imaging reconstructions in prospectively accelerated acquisitions.
  Conclusion: Slice-RAKI provides a patient specific neural network based
non-linear reconstruction which improves image quality compared with
conventional linear parallel imaging algorithms. It could find use in MR-guided
interventions such as MR-guided radiation therapy for use in rapid real-time
cine imaging for motion monitoring.

of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way,
allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects,

the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites.
Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the
electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an

further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results
obtained on spatial characterization of slow oscillations will be essential for

whether the theory is kept invariant under charge conjugation ($Q_L\to

few-TeV range mass of $W_R$ boson which would require $v_R \lesssim 10 \, (15)$
TeV if $g_R/g_L = 1 (0.65)$. This requires one quartic coupling in the scalar
potential to go non-perturbative, posing a theoretical problem if the $W_R$ is
discovered at LHC. We propose a simple extension of the minimal LRSM that adds
a $B-L=0$ scalar triplet and study how this can ameliorate this tension. We
find that such a model is also constrained from various considerations and
implies a lower bound on the $W_R$ mass of 8.1 (5.26) TeV for the parity case

Hamiltonian systems over last two decades. In this paper, synchronization for
coupled Harper system is investigated in both classical and quantum contexts.
The concept of measure synchronization involves with the phase space and it
seems that the measure synchronization is restricted in classical limit. But,
on the contrary, here, we have extended the aforesaid synchronization in
quantum domain. In quantum context, the coupling occurs between two many body
systems via a time and site dependent potential. The coupling leads to the
generation of entanglement between the quantum systems. We have used a
technique, which is already accepted in the classical domain, in both the
contexts to establish a connection between classical and quantum scenarios.
Interestingly, results corresponding to both the cases lead to some common
features.

spectrum contains photospheric absorption lines and wind features indicating
the presence of OB-type stars. The most significantly detected photospheric
features are used to characterize the recent star formation: neither
instantaneous nor continuous star-formation history is consistent with the
relative strength of the Si II $\lambda$1485 and S V $\lambda$1502 absorption.
Rather, at least two bursts of star formation took place in the recent past, at
$6^{+1}_{-2}$ Myr and $\gtrsim20$ Myr ago, respectively. We deduce a molecular
H$_{2}$ gas mass of $(3.9\pm1.0)\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ based on ALMA
observations of the [C I] $^3$P$_{2}$-$^3$P$_{1}$ emission. The molecular gas
mass is only 13 % of its stellar mass. Combined with its high star-formation
rate of ($1020^{+190}_{-170}$) Myr, this implies a high star-formation
efficiency of $(26\pm8$) Gyr$^{-1}$ and a short depletion time of $(38\pm12)$
Myr. We attribute the efficient star formation to compressive gas motions in
order to explain the modest velocity dispersions ($\leqslant$ 55 km s$^{-1}$)
of the photospheric lines and of the star-forming gas traced by [C I]. Because
of the likely very young age of the radio source, our findings suggest that
vigorous star formation consumes much of the gas and works in concert with the
AGN to remove any residual molecular gas, and eventually quenching star
formation in massive galaxies.

the decay of photons that acquire an in-medium plasma mass. These plasmon

including this channel leads to a significant reduction in the predicted signal

Anomaly Detection And Classification (BADAC) formalism, which provides a

hierarchical Bayesian framework. BADAC deals with uncertainties by
marginalising over the unknown, true, value of the data. Using simulated data
with Gaussian noise, BADAC is shown to be superior to standard algorithms in
both classification and anomaly detection performance in the presence of
uncertainties, though with significantly increased computational cost.
Additionally, BADAC provides well-calibrated classification probabilities,
valuable for use in scientific pipelines. We show that BADAC can work in online
mode and is fairly robust to model errors, which can be diagnosed through
model-selection methods. In addition it can perform unsupervised new class
detection and can naturally be extended to search for anomalous subsets of
data. BADAC is therefore ideal where computational cost is not a limiting
factor and statistical rigour is important. We discuss approximations to speed
up BADAC, such as the use of Gaussian processes, and finally introduce a new
metric, the Rank-Weighted Score (RWS), that is particularly suited to
evaluating the ability of algorithms to detect anomalies.

$\beta = 1.8$. From the best-fit model, we derive the dust temperature, $T_{\rm

resolution for SMC and LMC, and at 167 parsec resolution for all targets. This
measurement allows us to build the distribution of dust mass and luminosity as
functions of dust temperature and mass surface density. We compare those
distribution functions among galaxies and between regions in a galaxy. We find
that LMC has the highest mass-weighted average $T_{\rm d}$, while M31 and M33
have the lowest mass-weighted average $T_{\rm d}$. Within a galaxy, star
forming regions have higher $T_{\rm d}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm d}$ relative to the
overall distribution function, due to more intense heating by young stars and
higher gas mass surface density. When we degrade the resolutions to mimic
distant galaxies, the mass-weighted mean temperature gets warmer as the
resolution gets coarser, meaning the temperature derived from unresolved
observation is systematically higher than that in highly resolved observation.
As an implication, the total dust mass is lower (underestimated) in coarser
resolutions. This resolution-dependent effect is more prominent in clumpy
star-forming galaxies (SMC, LMC, and M33), and less prominent in more quiescent
massive spiral (M31).

previous studies are the following: 1) we use the most recent measurements,
namely 8 years of throughgoing muons and 7.5 years of High Energy Starting

consistent with the observations between 30 TeV and few PeV; 3) we use the
throughgoing muon flux to predict the number of astrophysical HESE tracks. We
show that accounting for the three previous elements, the result favors
surprisingly the hypothesis of neutrinos produced by neutron decay, disfavoring
the standard picture of neutrinos from pion decay at 2.0$\sigma$ and the damped
muons regime at $2.6 \sigma$, once the atmospheric background is considered.
Although the conventional scenario is not yet completely ruled out in the

energy spectrum characterized by a non trivial shape, this intriguing result
may suggest new directions for both theoretical interpretation and experimental

surrogate models are then employed to retrieve the surface thermal properties
by Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian inversion of observed infrared fluxes. We
apply the method to the inversion of simulated infrared fluxes of asteroid

planned for NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission -- and infrared observations of asteroid
(25143) Itokawa. In both cases, the surface properties of the asteroid -- such
as surface roughness, thermal inertia of the regolith and rock component, and
relative rock abundance -- are retrieved; the contribution from the regolith
and rock components are well separated. For the case of Itokawa, we retrieve a
rock abundance of about 85% for pebbles larger than the diurnal skin depth,
which is about 2 cm. The thermal inertia of the rock is found to be lower than
the expected value for LL chondrites, indicating that the rocks on Itokawa
could be fractured. The average thermal inertia of the surface is around 750 $J

corresponds to an average regolith particle diameter of about 10 mm,
consistently with in situ measurements as well as results from previous

up-type vector-like fermion pair and three right-handed neutrinos charged under
the relaxion shift symmetry. The observed dark matter abundance is generated
automatically by oscillations of the relaxion field that begin once it is
misaligned from its original stopping point after reheating. The
matter-antimatter asymmetry arises from spontaneous baryogenesis induced by the
CPT violation due to the rolling of the relaxion after reheating. The CPT
violation is communicated to the baryons and leptons via an operator,
$\partial_\mu \phi J^\mu$, where $J^\mu$ consists of right-handed neutrino
currents arising naturally from a simple neutrino mass model. Finally, the
strong CP problem is solved via the Nelson-Barr mechanism, i.e. by imposing CP
as a symmetry of the Lagrangian that is broken only spontaneously by the
relaxion. The CP breaking is such that although an ${\cal O}(1)$ strong CKM
phase is generated, the induced strong CP phase is much smaller, i.e., within

quasicircular orbit, each with spins $\chi_{\rm{NS}}=-0.053,\,0,\,0.24$, or
$0.36$. The stars are endowed initially with a dipolar magnetic field extending
from the interior into the exterior, as in a radio pulsar. Following merger,
the redistribution of angular momentum by magnetic braking and magnetic
turbulent viscosity in the hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant, along with
the loss of angular momentum due to gravitational radiation, induce the
formation of a massive, nearly uniformly rotating inner core surrounded by a
magnetized Keplerian disk-like envelope. The HMNS eventually collapses to a BH,
with spin $a/M_{\rm BH} \simeq 0.78$ independent of the initial spin of the
NSs, surrounded by a magnetized accretion disk. The larger the initial NS spin
the heavier the disk. After $\Delta t\sim 3000-4000 M \sim 45-60(M_{\rm
NS}/1.625M_\odot)\rm ms$ following merger, a mildly relativistic jet is
launched. The lifetime of the jet [$\Delta t\sim 100-140(M_{\rm
NS}/1.625M_\odot)\rm ms$] and its outgoing Poynting luminosity [$L_{\rm EM}\sim
10^{51.5\pm 1}\rm erg/s$] are consistent with typical sGRBs, as well as with
the Blandford--Znajek mechanism for launching jets and their associated
Poynting luminosities.

Furthermore, the proposed framework is capable of addressing supervised,

the framework adopts a regularization term over the codewords, which
automatically chooses the codewords for the problem. To efficiently solve the

also show that one step of the algorithms can be casted into several Support
Vector Machine problems which enables our algorithms to utilize efficient

results on photons, we use it to characterise visons and their thermodynamic
behaviour, which remained hitherto largely unexplored. We find that visons, in
contrast to spinons in classical spin ice, form a weak electrolyte: vison pairs
are the dominant population at low temperatures. This is reflected in the
behaviour of thermodynamic quantities, such as pinch point motifs in the
relevant correlators. Visons also appear to strongly hybridise with the photon
background, a phenomenon that affects the way these quasiparticles may show up

athermal, frictionless, soft-core two dimensional spherocylinders driven in
uniform steady state shear. Energy dissipation is via a viscous drag with
respect to a uniformly sheared host fluid, giving a model for a non-Brownian
suspension with a Newtonian rheology. We study pressure $p$ and deviatoric
shear stress $\sigma$ as a function of packing fraction $\phi$, strain rate
$\dot\gamma$, and a parameter $\alpha$ that measures the asphericity of the
particles. We consider the anisotropy of the stress tensor, the macroscopic
friction $\mu=\sigma/p$, and the divergence of the transport coefficient
$\eta_p=p/\dot\gamma$ as $\phi$ is increased to the jamming $\phi_J$. From an
analysis of Herschel-Bulkley rheology above jamming, we estimate $\phi_J$ as a
function of $\alpha$ and show that the variation of $\phi_J$ with $\alpha$ is
the main cause for differences in rheology as $\alpha$ is varied. However a
detailed scaling analysis of the divergence of $\eta_p$ for our most elongated
particles suggests that the jamming transition of spherocylinders may be in a
different universality class than that of circular disks. We compute the number
of contacts per particle $Z$ in the system and show that at jamming $Z_J$ is a
non-monotonic function of $\alpha$ that is always smaller than the isostatic
value. We measure the probability distribution of contacts per unit surface
length $\mathcal{P}(\vartheta)$ at polar angle $\vartheta$ with respect to the
spherocylinder spine, and find that as $\alpha\to 0$ this distribution seems to
diverge at $\vartheta=\pi/2$, giving a finite limiting probability for contacts
on the vanishingly small flat sides of the spherocylinder. Finally we consider

locate n marks on a ruler such that the distance between any two distinct pair
of marks are different from each other and the total length of the ruler is
minimized. The Golomb ruler problem has applications in information theory,
astronomy and communications, and it can be seen as a challenge for
combinatorial optimization algorithms. Although constructing high quality
rulers is well-studied, proving optimality is a far more challenging task. In
this paper, we provide a computational comparison of different optimization
paradigms, each using a different model (linear integer, constraint programming
and quadratic integer) to certify that a given Golomb ruler is optimal. We
propose several enhancements to improve the computational performance of each
method by exploring bound tightening, valid inequalities, cutting planes and
branching strategies. We conclude that a certain quadratic integer programming
model solved through a Benders decomposition and strengthened by two types of
valid inequalities performs the best in terms of solution time for small-sized
Golomb ruler problem instances. On the other hand, a constraint programming
model improved by range reduction and a particular branching strategy could
have more potential to solve larger size instances due to its promising
parallelization features.

is a challenging yet important problem in biology. Structures are not known for
the vast majority of protein sequences, but structure is critical for
understanding function. Existing approaches for detecting structural similarity
between proteins from sequence are unable to recognize and exploit structural
patterns when sequences have diverged too far, limiting our ability to transfer
knowledge between structurally related proteins. We newly approach this problem
through the lens of representation learning. We introduce a framework that maps
any protein sequence to a sequence of vector embeddings --- one per amino acid
position --- that encode structural information. We train bidirectional long
short-term memory (LSTM) models on protein sequences with a two-part feedback
mechanism that incorporates information from (i) global structural similarity
between proteins and (ii) pairwise residue contact maps for individual
proteins. To enable learning from structural similarity information, we define
a novel similarity measure between arbitrary-length sequences of vector
embeddings based on a soft symmetric alignment (SSA) between them. Our method
is able to learn useful position-specific embeddings despite lacking direct
observations of position-level correspondence between sequences. We show
empirically that our multi-task framework outperforms other sequence-based
methods and even a top-performing structure-based alignment method when
predicting structural similarity, our goal. Finally, we demonstrate that our
learned embeddings can be transferred to other protein sequence problems,
improving the state-of-the-art in transmembrane domain prediction.

were willing to pay more to ship grocery items such as food, beverages, and

  in Healthcare Applications","34 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Providing a mechanism to authenticate users in healthcare applications is an
essential security requirement to prevent both external and internal attackers
from penetrating patients' identities and revealing their health data. Many
schemes have been developed to provide authentication mechanisms to ensure that
only legitimate users are authorized to connect, but these schemes still suffer
from vulnerable security. Various attacks expose patients' data for malicious
tampering or destruction. Transferring health-related data and information
between users and the health centre makes them exposed to penetration by
adversaries as they may move through an insecure channel. In addition, previous
mechanisms have suffered from the poor protection of users' authentication
information. To ensure the protection of patients' information and data, we
propose a scheme that authenticates users based on the information of both the
device and the legitimate user. In this paper, we propose a Robust
Authentication Model for Healthcare Users (RAMHU) that provides mutual
authentication between server and clients. This model utilizes an Elliptic
Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and PHOTON to achieve strong
security and a good overall performance. RAMHU relies on multi pseudonyms,
physical address, and one-time password mechanisms to authenticate legitimate
users. Moreover, extensive informal and formal security analysis with the
automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA)
tool demonstrates that our model offers a high level of security in repelling a
wide variety of possible attacks.

coupled in one element are particularly useful for small sized bio-inspired
robotic flyers, whose weight, size, and power are under stringent constraint.
In this work, we present the first flapping-wing robot using its flapping wings
for environmental perception and navigation in tight space, without the need
for any visual feedback. As the test platform, we introduce the Purdue
Hummingbird, a flapping-wing robot with 17cm wingspan and 12 grams weight, with
a pair of 30-40Hz flapping wings driven by only two actuators. By interpreting
the wing loading feedback and its variations, the vehicle can detect the
presence of environmental changes such as grounds, walls, stairs, obstacles and
wind gust. The instantaneous wing loading can be obtained through the
measurements and interpretation of the current feedback by the motors that
actuate the wings. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally
demonstrated on several challenging flight tasks without vision: terrain
following, wall following and going through a narrow corridor. To ensure flight
stability, a robust controller was designed for handling unforeseen
disturbances during the flight. Sensing and navigating one's environment
through actuator loading is a promising method for mobile robots, and it can
serve as an alternative or complementary method to visual perception.

that explicit finite difference or finite element schemes for the heat equation

where $\Delta x$ is the finest spatial grid spacing. In contrast, for the
Dirichlet and Neumann problems on the unit ball in all dimensions $d\ge 1$, we
show that the simplest Volterra marching scheme, i.e., the forward Euler
scheme, is unconditionally stable. Our proof is based on an explicit spectral
radius bound of the marching matrix, leading to an estimate that an $L^2$-norm
of the solution to the integral equation is bounded by $c_dT^{d/2}$ times the
norm of the right hand side. For the Robin problem on the half space in any
dimension, with constant Robin (heat transfer) coefficient $\kappa$, we exhibit
a constant $C$ such that the forward Euler scheme is stable if $\Delta t <
C/\kappa^2$, independent of any spatial discretization. This relies on new
lower bounds on the spectrum of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices defined by
convex sequences. Finally, we show that the forward Euler scheme is
unconditionally stable for the Dirichlet problem on any smooth convex domain in

borrow from the new results on widely linear reproducing kernel Hilbert space

proposed by the authors. This paper shows that in the adaptive version of the
kernel regression for complex-valued signals we need to include another kernel
term, the so-called pseudo-kernel. This new solution is endowed with better
representation capabilities in complex-valued fields, since it can efficiently
decouple the learning of the real and the imaginary part. Also, we review
previous realizations of the complex KLMS algorithm and its augmented version
to prove that they can be rewritten as particular cases of the gCKLMS.
Furthermore, important conclusions on the kernels design are drawn that help to
greatly improve the convergence of the algorithms. In the experiments, we
revisit the nonlinear channel equalization problem to highlight the better
convergence of the gCKLMS compared to previous solutions. Also, the flexibility
of the proposed generalized approach is tested in a second experiment with
non-independent real and imaginary parts. The results illustrate the
significant performance improvements of the gCKLMS approach when the
complex-valued signals have different properties for the real and imaginary

one third of main sequence stars. It has been proposed that super-Earths are
scaled-up terrestrial planets that formed similarly, through mutual accretion
of planetary embryos, but in discs much denser than the solar protoplanetary
disc. We argue instead that terrestrial planets and super-Earths have two
distinct formation pathways that are regulated by the disc's pebble reservoir.
Through numerical integrations, which combine pebble accretion and N-body
gravity between embryos, we show that a difference of a factor of two in the
pebble mass-flux is enough to change the evolution from the terrestrial to the
super-Earth growth mode. If the pebble mass-flux is small, then the initial
embryos within the ice line grow slowly and do not migrate substantially,
resulting in a widely spaced population of Mars-mass embryos when the gas disc
dissipates. Without gas being present, the embryos become unstable and a small
number of terrestrial planets are formed by mutual collisions. The final
terrestrial planets are at most 5 Earth masses. Instead, if the pebble
mass-flux is high, then the initial embryos within the ice line rapidly become
sufficiently massive to migrate through the gas disc. Embryos concentrate at
the inner edge of the disc and growth accelerates through mutual merging. This
leads to the formation of a system of closely spaced super-Earths in the 5 to
20 Earth-mass range, bounded by the pebble isolation mass. Generally,
instabilities of these super-Earth systems after the disappearance of the gas
disc trigger additional merging events and dislodge the system from resonant
chains. The pebble flux - which controls the transition between the two growth
modes - may be regulated by the initial reservoir of solids in the disc or the
presence of more distant giant planets that can halt the radial flow of
pebbles.

inhomogeneity and anisotropy at all scales. In this paper we analyze the
viability of a set of inflationary potentials in both the context of the
collapse proposal and within the standard inflationary framework. For this, we
perform a statistical analysis using recent CMB and BAO data to obtain the
prediction for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ in the context of a particular
collapse model: the Wigner scheme. The predicted $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r$ in terms of the slow roll parameters is different between the
collapse scheme and the standard inflationary model. For each potential
considered we compare the prediction of $n_s$ and $r$ with the limits
established by observational data in both pictures. The result of our analysis
shows in most cases a difference in the inflationary potentials allowed by the
observational limits in both frameworks. In particular, in the standard
approach the more concave a potential is, the more is favored by the data. On
the other hand, in the Wigner scheme, the data favors equally all type of
concave potentials, including those at the border between convex and concave

  Motion data had been previously collected from 6 stroke patients wearing 11
inertial measurement units (IMUs) as they moved objects on a target array. To
identify optimal ML performance, we evaluated 4 algorithms that are commonly
used in activity recognition (linear discriminant analysis (LDA), na\""ive
Bayes, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors). We compared their
classification accuracy, computational complexity, and tuning requirements. To
identify optimal sensor configuration, we progressively sampled fewer sensors
and compared classification accuracy. To identify optimal data requirements, we
compared accuracy using data from IMUs versus accelerometers.
  We found that LDA had the highest classification accuracy (92%) of the
algorithms tested. It also was the most pragmatic, with low training and
testing times and modest tuning requirements. We found that 7 sensors on the
paretic arm and back resulted in the best accuracy. Using this array,
accelerometers had a lower accuracy (84%).
  We refined strategies to accurately and pragmatically quantify functional

smaller than $\Delta_0$. Motivated by recent work on covering integer programs

rounding followed by alteration, similar to those of Bansal et al.
\cite{bansal-sparse} (but with a twist), yield approximation ratios for PIPs

independent set even when $\Delta_1 \le 2$. In sharp contrast to this negative
result, as soon as width is strictly larger than one, we obtain positive
results via the natural LP relaxation. For PIPs with width $W = 1 + \epsilon$

$\Omega(\epsilon^2/\Delta_1)$-approximation. In the large width regime, when $W
\ge 2$, we obtain an $\Omega((\frac{1}{1 +

a relatively impenetrable surface). The parameters in these GSTCs are
interpreted as effective surface susceptibilities and surface porosities, which
themselves are related to the geometry of the apertures that constitute the
metascreen. In this paper, we use these GSTCs to derive the plane-wave
reflection ($R$) and transmission ($T$) coefficients of a symmetric metascreen,
expressed in terms of these surface parameters. From these equations, we
develop a retrieval approach for determining the uniquely defined effective
surface susceptibilities and surface porosities that characterize the
metascreen from measured or simulated data for the $R$ and $T$ coefficients. We
present the retrieved surface parameters for metascreens composed of five
different types of apertures (circular holes, square holes, crosses, slots, and
a square aperture filled with a high-contrast dielectric). The last example
exhibits interesting resonances at frequencies where no resonances exist when
the aperture is not filled, which opens up the possibility of designing
metasurfaces with unique filtering properties. The retrieved surface parameters
are validated by comparing them to other approaches.

parameters that describe an astronomical (or any) physical system. We recall
that behind Dimensionless scaling laws in complex, self-interacting physical
objects lies a rigorous theorem of Dimensional analysis, known widely as the
Buckingham theorem. Once a {\it catalogue} of properties and forces that define
an object or physical system is established, the theorem allows one to select a
complete set of Dimensionless quantities or {\it Numbers} on which structure
must depend. The internal structure takes the form of a functionally defined
manifold in the space of these Numbers. Simple and familiar examples are
discussed by way of introduction. Correlations in properties of astronomical
objects can be sought either through the constancy of these Numbers or between
pairs of the Numbers. In either case, within errors, the functional dependences
take on an absolute numerical character. As our principal application, we study
a well defined sample of galaxies in order to reveal the implied Tully Fisher
and Baryonic Tully Fisher relations. We find that $L\,\propto\,v_{rot}^4$ for
the former and $M_b\,\propto\,v_{rot}^3$ for the latter, suggesting that these
relations may have different causal origins.

inherently non-Gaussian whereby the error covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}_{ij}$
of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) contains a trispectrum contribution that would
be absent if the signal were Gaussian. Using the binned power spectrum and
trispectrum from simulations, here we present a methodology for incorporating
these with the baseline distribution and system noise to make error predictions
for observations with any radio-interferometric array. Here we consider the
upcoming SKA-Low. Non-Gaussianity enhances the errors introducing a positive
deviation $\Delta$ relative to the Gaussian predictions. $\Delta$ increases
with observation time $t_{\rm obs}$ and saturates as the errors approach the
cosmic variance. Considering $t_{\rm obs}=1024$ hours where a $5 \sigma$
detection is possible at all redshifts $7 \le z \le 13$, in the absence of
foregrounds we find that the deviations are important at small $k$ where we
have $\Delta \sim 40-100 \%$ at $k~\sim 0.04 ~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for some of the
redshifts and also at intermediate $k \, (\sim 0.4 ~{\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ where we
have $\Delta \sim 200 \%$ at $z=7$. Non-Gaussianity also introduces
correlations between the errors in different $k$ bins, and we find both
correlations and anticorrelations with the correlation coefficient value
spanning $-0.4 \le r_{ij} \le 0.8$. Incorporating the foreground wedge,
$\Delta$ continues to be important ($> 50\%$) at $z=7$. We conclude that
non-Gaussianity makes a significant contribution to the errors and this is
important in the context of the future instruments that aim to achieve

osteoblast differentiation and bone remodelling. Mechanotransduction provides
the link between modulation of the extracellular matrix and intracellular
actions. By controlling the balance between the intracellular and extracellular
domains, the mechanotransduction process determines optimal functionality of
the skeletal dynamics, and it is one of the possible causes of
osteophatological diseases.
  Results: Mechanotransduction in a single osteoblast under external mechanical
perturbations has been modelled in the agent based framework to reproduce the
dynamics of the stochastic reaction diffusion process among molecules in the
cytoplasm, nuclear and extracellular domains. The amount of molecules and
fluctuations of each molecular class has been analysed in terms of recurrences
of critical events. A numerical approach has been developed to invert
subordination processes and to extract the directing processes from the
molecular signals in order to derive the distribution of recurrence of events.
  Conclusions: We observed large fluctuations enclose information hidden in the
noise which is beyond the dynamic variations of molecular baselines. Studying
the system under different parametric conditions and stimuli, the results have
shown that the waiting time distributions of each molecule are a signature of
the system's dynamics. The behaviours of the molecular waiting times change
with the changing of parameters presenting the same variation of patterns for
similar interacting molecules and identifying specific alterations for key
molecules in the mechanotransduction pathway.

states for a given applied voltage. Noise effects are particularly strong near
the onset and offset of bistable current behavior, corresponding to bifurcation

evidence of very long c-axis phonon MFPs at room temperature in these layered

adversarial attacks. Verification algorithms fall into two categories: exact
verifiers that run in exponential time and relaxed verifiers that are efficient
but incomplete. In this paper, we unify all existing LP-relaxed verifiers, to
the best of our knowledge, under a general convex relaxation framework. This
framework works for neural networks with diverse architectures and
nonlinearities and covers both primal and dual views of robustness
verification. We further prove strong duality between the primal and dual
problems under very mild conditions. Next, we perform large-scale experiments,
amounting to more than 22 CPU-years, to obtain exact solution to the
convex-relaxed problem that is optimal within our framework for ReLU networks.
We find the exact solution does not significantly improve upon the gap between
PGD and existing relaxed verifiers for various networks trained normally or
robustly on MNIST and CIFAR datasets. Our results suggest there is an inherent
barrier to tight verification for the large class of methods captured by our
framework. We discuss possible causes of this barrier and potential future
directions for bypassing it. Our code and trained models are available at

basic parameterized problems admit parameterized algorithms where $f(k)$ is
single-exponential, that is, $c^k$ for some constant $c$, which makes aiming
for such a running time a natural goal for other problems as well. However
there are still plenty of problems where the $f(k)$ appearing in the best known

  In this paper, we examine parameterized problems where $f(k)$ is

error can be provably reduced by having a shared input representation that
makes the source and target domains indistinguishable from each other. Very
recently it has been studied that not just matching the marginal input
distributions, but the alignment of output (class) distributions is also
critical. The latter can be achieved by minimizing the maximum discrepancy of
predictors (classifiers). In this paper, we adopt this principle, but propose a
more systematic and effective way to achieve hypothesis consistency via
Gaussian processes (GP). The GP allows us to define/induce a hypothesis space
of the classifiers from the posterior distribution of the latent random
functions, turning the learning into a simple large-margin posterior separation
problem, far easier to solve than previous approaches based on adversarial
minimax optimization. We formulate a learning objective that effectively pushes
the posterior to minimize the maximum discrepancy. This is further shown to be
equivalent to maximizing margins and minimizing uncertainty of the class
predictions in the target domain, a well-established principle in classical
(semi-)supervised learning. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach is
comparable or superior to the existing methods on several benchmark domain

Here, we offer one useful framework with an aim to stimulate dialogue between

for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction,
computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been
an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm, a collection of

problems of other second order forms, but are almost always non-conservative.
Additionally, the standard LS form is not compatible with discrete ordinates
method (Sn) iterative solution techniques such as source iteration. A new form
of the least-squares transport equation has recently been developed that is
compatible with voids and standard Sn iterative solution techniques. Performing
Nonlinear Diffusion Acceleration (NDA) using an independently-differenced
low-order equation enforces conservation for the whole system, and makes this
equation suitable for reactor physics calculations.
  In this context independent means that both the transport and low-order
solutions converge to the same scalar flux and current as the spatial mesh is
refined, but for a given mesh, the solutions are not necessarily equal. In this
paper we show that introducing a weight function to this least-squares equation
improves issues with causality and can render our equation equal to the
Self-Adjoint Angular Flux (SAAF) equation. Causality is a principle of the
transport equation which states that information only travels downstream along
characteristics. This principle can be violated numerically. We show how to
limit the weight function in voids and demonstrate the effect of this limit on
the accuracy. Using the C5G7 benchmark, we compare our method to the
self-adjoint angular flux formulation with a void treatment (\SAAFt), which is
not self-adjoint and has a non-symmetric coefficient matrix. We show that the
weighted least-squares equation with NDA gives acceptable accuracy relative to
the SAAFt equation while maintaining a symmetric positive-definite system

color when the particles are on the scale of the wavelength of visible light.
Previous work has shown that the positions of the peaks in the reflectance
spectra can be predicted accurately from a single-scattering model that
accounts for the effective refractive index of the material. This agreement
shows that the main color peak arises from short-range correlations between
particles. However, the single-scattering model does not quantitatively
reproduce the observed color: the main peak in the reflectance spectrum is much
broader and the reflectance at low wavelengths is much larger than predicted by
the model. We use a combination of experiment and theory to understand these
features. We find that one significant contribution to the breadth of the main
peak is light that is scattered, totally internally reflected from the boundary
of the sample, and then scattered again. The high reflectance at low
wavelengths also results from multiple scattering but can be traced to the
increase in the scattering cross-section of individual particles with
decreasing wavelength. Both of these effects tend to reduce the saturation of
the structural color, which limits the use of these materials in applications.
We show that while the single-scattering model cannot reproduce the observed
saturations, it can be used to design materials in which multiple scattering is
suppressed and the color saturated, even in the absence of absorbing
components.

for detecting differentially abundant taxonomic features across healthy and
diseased populations, with the ultimate goal of deciphering the relationship
between the microbiome diversity and health conditions. As the microbiome data
are high-dimensional, typically featuring by uneven sampling depth,
overdispersion and a huge amount of zeros, these data characteristics often
hamper the downstream analysis. Moreover, the taxonomic features are implicitly
imposed by the phylogenetic tree structure and often ignored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for the
analysis of microbiome count data for differential abundance analysis. Under
this framework, we introduce a bi-level Bayesian hierarchical model that allows
a flexible choice of the count generating process, and hyperpriors in the
feature selection scheme. We particularly focus on employing a zero-inflated
negative binomial model with a Bayesian nonparametric prior model on the bottom
level, and applying Gaussian mixture models for differentially abundant taxa
detection on the top level. Our method allows for the simultaneous modeling of
sample heterogeneity and detecting differentially abundant taxa. We conducted
comprehensive simulations and summarized the improved statistical performances
of the proposed model. We applied the model in two real microbiome study
datasets and successfully identified biologically validated differentially
abundant taxa. We hope that the proposed framework and model can facilitate
further microbiome studies and elucidate disease etiology.

introduces a new multistage method to extract Google Scholar citation counts
for large collections of dissertations from repositories indexed by Google. The
method was used to extract Google Scholar citation counts for 77,884 American
doctoral dissertations from 2013-2017 via ProQuest, with a precision of over
95%. Some ProQuest dissertations that were dual indexed with other repositories
could not be retrieved with ProQuest-specific searches but could be found with
Google Scholar searches of the other repositories. The Google Scholar citation
counts were then compared with Mendeley reader counts, a known source of
scholarly-like impact data. A fifth of the dissertations had at least one
citation recorded in Google Scholar and slightly fewer had at least one
Mendeley reader. Based on numerical comparisons, the Mendeley reader counts
seem to be more useful for impact assessment purposes for dissertations that
are less than two years old, whilst Google Scholar citations are more useful
for older dissertations, especially in social sciences, arts and humanities.
Google Scholar citation counts may reflect a more scholarly type of impact than
that of Mendeley reader counts because dissertations attract a substantial
minority of their citations from other dissertations. In summary, the new
method now makes it possible for research funders, institutions and others to
systematically evaluate the impact of dissertations, although additional Google

comparatively recently, with the advent of a new generation of instruments,
that it has become possible to capture data with sufficient resolution
(temporal, spectral and angular) that one can begin to characterize the solar
morphology simultaneously along the axes of time and frequency. This ability is
naturally accompanied by an enormous increase in data volumes and computational
burden, a problem which will only become more acute with the next generation of
instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The usual approach, which
requires manual guidance of the calibration process, is impractical. Here we
present the ""Automated Imaging Routine for Compact Arrays for the Radio Sun

arrays with a compact core. We have used AIRCARS so far on data from the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase-I. The dynamic range of the images is
routinely from a few hundred to a few thousand. In the few cases, where we have
pushed AIRCARS to its limits, the dynamic range can go as high as $\sim$75000.
The images made represent a substantial improvement in the state-of-the-art in
terms of imaging fidelity and dynamic range. This has the potential to
transform the multi-petabyte MWA solar archive from raw visibilities into

CP symmetry in the standard model (SM) of electroweak interactions. In such a
way, complex Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrices are achieved which stand
for the violation of CP symmetry. At the beginning, two necessary but not
sufficient conditions for yielding a complex CKM matrix are stated as criteria.
Then we found an interesting condition between the real and imaginary parts of
a Hermitian $3\times 3$ matrix may provide extra relations among its parameters
and reduce the number of them from eighteen down to five. In previous
investigations, this can be done only down to nine. With another assumption
among some of those parameters, the mass-matrix pattern is further simplified
so as to be diagonalized analytically and in consequence four matrices which
reveal $S_N$ symmetries among or between quark generations are obtained. In
some of such $S_N$-symmetric cases, the derived CKM matrices are complex which
indicate that CP symmetry is violated accordingly. Taking the Jarlskog
invariant as an estimate of the CPV strength, the value predicted by this model
is orders stronger than the empirical value detected experimentally. However,
that happens to fill partly the gap between the cosmologically observed amount
of Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) and that current Standard Model of
particle physics predicts. It also proves the long suspected existence of
BAU-productive eras in early universe if some fermions were indistinguishable,
i.e., $S_N$-symmetric, under circumstances of extremely high temperatures.

the symplectic plane, apply it to the Schr\""odinger polarization and study the
corresponding evolution of polarized sections. The flow is periodic in
imaginary time and the evolution of polarized sections has interesting
features. On the time intervals for which the polarization is real or K\""ahler,
the half--form corrected time evolution of polarized sections is given by
unitary operators which turn out to be equivalent to the classical
Segal-Bargmann transforms (which are usually associated to the quadratic
elliptic Hamiltonian $H=\frac12 p^2$ and to the heat operator). At the right
endpoint of these intervals, the evolution of polarized sections is given by
the Fourier transform from the Schr\""odinger to the momentum representation. In
the complementary intervals of imaginary time, the polarizations are
anti--K\""ahler and the Hilbert space of polarized sections collapses to
${\mathcal H}= \{0\}$.
  Hyperbolic quadratic Hamiltonians thus give rise to a new factorization of
the Segal-Bargmann transform, which is very different from the usual one, where
one first applies a bounded contraction operator (the heat kernel operator),
mapping $L^2$--states to real analytic functions with unique analytic
continuation, and then one applies analytic continuation. In the factorization
induced by an hyperbolic complexifier, both factors are unbounded operators but
their composition is, in the K\""ahler or real sectors, unitary.

unitary transforms to the definition of new holomorphic fractional Fourier
transforms.

However, extensions of these learning algorithms beyond the uniform

quantum algorithms for learning Boolean linear functions on $n$ bits from

applicable to any (except full) bias and requires $\mathcal{O}(\ln (n))$

is independent of $n$, but the strategy is applicable only for small bias.
Moreover, we show that the second procedure is stable w.r.t. noisy training
data and w.r.t. faulty quantum gates. This also enables us to solve a version
of the learning problem in which the underlying distribution is not known in
advance. Finally, we prove lower bounds on the classical and quantum sample
complexities of the learning problem. Whereas classically, $\Omega (n)$
examples are necessary independently of the bias, we are able to establish a
quantum sample complexity lower bound of $\Omega (\ln (n))$ only under an
assumption of large bias. Nevertheless, this allows for a discussion of the
performance of our suggested learning algorithms w.r.t. sample complexity. With

transport may be understood as a result of the increased coherency of the
thermal plumes, which are elementary heat carriers of the system. To our
knowledge this is the first time that a heat transfer enhancement by the
stabilising Lorentz force in quasistatic magnetoconvection has been observed.
We further found that the optimal enhancement may be understood in terms of the

that temperature fluctuations are maximum near the position where the BLs

both environments galaxies hosting AGNs are generally old, with low star

free-electron laser pulses. It is based upon our previously reported code XTANT
(X-ray-induced Thermal And Nonthermal Transition; N. Medvedev et. al, 4open 1,
3, 2018), which combines tight-binding (TB) molecular dynamics for atoms with
Monte Carlo modeling of high-energy electrons and core-holes, and Boltzmann
collision integrals for nonadiabatic electron-ion coupling. The current version
of the code, XTANT-3, includes LCAO basis sets sp3, sp3s*, and sp3d5, and can
operate with both orthogonal and nonorthogonal Hamiltonians. It includes the TB
parameterizations by Goodwin et al., a transferrable version of Vogl's et al.
TB, NRL, and DFTB. Considering that other modules of the code are applicable to
any chemical element, this makes XTANT-3 capable of treating a large variety of
materials. In order to extend it to the WDM regime, a few limitations that must
be overcome are discussed here: short-range repulsion potential must be
sufficiently strong; basis sets must span large enough energy space within the
conduction band; dependence of the electronic scattering cross sections on the
electronic and atomic temperatures and structure needs to be considered.
Directions at solving these issues are outlined in this proceeding.

inevitably led to low stiffness and high-density materials. Here, we transcend

In addition, the power of primal-dual mesh pairs, exemplified by

numerous formulations. The VoroCrust algorithm is the first provably-correct

from a human rights perspective, with a primary focus on identity systems in
the developed world. We assert that individual persons must be allowed to
manage their personal information in a multitude of different ways in different
contexts and that to do so, each individual must be able to create multiple
unrelated identities. Therefore, we first define a set of fundamental
constraints that digital identity systems must satisfy to preserve and promote
privacy as required for individual autonomy. With these constraints in mind, we
then propose a decentralised, standards-based approach, using a combination of
distributed ledger technology and thoughtful regulation, to facilitate
many-to-many relationships among providers of key services. Our proposal for
digital identity differs from others in its approach to trust in that we do not
seek to bind credentials to each other or to a mutually trusted authority to
achieve strong non-transferability. Because the system does not implicitly
encourage its users to maintain a single aggregated identity that can
potentially be constrained or reconstructed against their interests,
individuals and organisations are free to embrace the system and share in its
benefits.

investigate how the formation of planetary systems depends on the radial flux
of pebbles through the protoplanetary disc and on the planet migration rate.
Our N-body simulations confirm previous findings that Jupiter-like planets in
orbits outside the water ice line originate from embryos starting out at 20-40
AU when using nominal type-I and type-II migration rates and a pebble flux of
100-200 Earth masses per million years, enough to grow Jupiter within the
lifetime of the solar nebula. The planetary embryos placed up to 30AU migrate
into the inner system (r<1AU) and form super-Earths or hot and warm gas giants,
producing systems that are inconsistent with the configuration of the solar
system, but consistent with some exoplanetary systems. We also explore slower
migration rates which allow the formation of gas giants from embryos
originating from the 5-10AU region, which are stranded exterior to 1 AU at the
end of the gas-disc phase. We identify a pebble flux threshold below which
migration dominates and moves the planetary core to the inner disc, where the
pebble isolation mass is too low for the planet to accrete gas efficiently.
Giant planet growth requires a sufficiently-high pebble flux to enable growth
to out-compete migration. Even higher pebble fluxes produce systems with
multiple gas giants. We show that planetary embryos starting interior to 5AU do
not grow into gas giants, even if migration is slow and the pebble flux is
large. Instead they grow to the mass regime of super-Earths. This stunted
growth is caused by the low pebble isolation mass in the inner disc and is
independent of the pebble flux. Additionally we show that the long term
evolution of our formed planetary systems can produce systems with hot
super-Earths and outer gas giants as well as systems of giants on eccentric
orbits (abridged).

We show that the integrated pebble mass reservoir creates a bifurcation between
hot super-Earths or hot-Neptunes ($\lesssim15M_{\oplus}$) and super-massive
planetary cores potentially able to become gas giant planets
($\gtrsim15M_{\oplus}$). Simulations with moderate pebble fluxes grow multiple
super-Earth-mass planets that migrate inwards and pile up at the inner edge of
the disk forming long resonant chains. We follow the long-term dynamical
evolution of these systems and use the period ratio distribution of observed
planet-pairs to constrain our model. Up to $\sim$95\% of resonant chains become
dynamically unstable after the gas disk dispersal, leading to a phase of late
collisions that breaks the original resonant configurations. Our simulations
naturally match observations when they produce a dominant fraction
($\gtrsim95\%$) of unstable systems with a sprinkling ($\lesssim5\%$) of stable
resonant chains (the Trappist-1 system represents one such example). Our
results demonstrate that super-Earth systems are inherently multiple (${\rm
N\geq2}$) and that the observed excess of single-planet transits is a
consequence of the mutual inclinations excited by the planet--planet
instability. In simulations in which planetary seeds are initially distributed

relocation, and replenishment decisions at each decision epoch. To enhance

  with Dynamic Task Arrivals","7 pages, 3 figures, and Accepted by IEEE ICC 2019, Shanghai, China",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers a wireless powered multiuser mobile edge computing (MEC)
system, where a multi-antenna access point (AP) employs the radio-frequency
(RF) signal based wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge a number of
distributed users, and each user utilizes the harvested energy to execute
computation tasks via local computing and task offloading. We consider the
frequency division multiple access (FDMA) protocol to support simultaneous task
offloading from multiple users to the AP. Different from previous works that
considered one-shot optimization with static task models, we study the joint
computation and wireless resource allocation optimization with dynamic task
arrivals over a finite time horizon consisting of multiple slots. Under this
setup, our objective is to minimize the system energy consumption including the
AP's transmission energy and the MEC server's computing energy over the whole
horizon, by jointly optimizing the transmit energy beamforming at the AP, and
the local computing and task offloading strategies at the users over different
time slots. To characterize the fundamental performance limit of such systems,
we focus on the offline optimization by assuming the task and channel
information are known a-priori at the AP. In this case, the energy minimization
problem corresponds to a convex optimization problem. Leveraging the Lagrange
duality method, we obtain the optimal solution to this problem in a well
structure. It is shown that in order to maximize the system energy efficiency,
the optimal number of task input-bits at each user and the AP are monotonically
increasing over time, and the offloading strategies at different users depend
on both the wireless channel conditions and the task load at the AP. Numerical
results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed joint-WPT-MEC design over
alternative benchmark schemes without such joint design.

hosting capacity methods study the problem considering a large number of
scenarios, many of which provide little additional information. We overcome
this problem by studying only cases where voltage constraints are active, with
results illustrating a reduction in the number of scenarios required by an
order of magnitude. A linear power flow model is utilised for this task,
showing excellent performance. The hosting capacity is finally studied as a
function of the number of generators connected, demonstrating that assumptions

underlying mean-field states. By and large, multi-dimensional geometries afford
unique opportunities to explore the existence of complex self-sustained states,

optimality criterion is to minimize the average (over pairs of points chosen
independently from the distribution) time to travel between the points, where a
travel path consists of any line segments in the plane traversed at slow speed
and any route within the subway network traversed at a faster speed. Of major
interest is how the shape of the optimal network changes as $L$ increases. We
first study the simplest variant of this problem where the optimization
criterion is to minimize the average distance from a point to the network, and
we provide some general arguments about the optimal networks. As a second
variant we consider the optimal network that minimizes the average travel time
to a central destination, and discuss both analytically and numerically some
simple shapes such as the star network, the ring or combinations of both these

minimizes the average time between all pairs of points. For this case, we
propose a scaling form for the average time that we verify numerically. We also
show that in the medium-length regime, as $L$ increases, resources go

asymmetry of the magnetic field in a rest frame of the electron, which appears
thanks to the spreading of the packet with time. Thus, somewhat contrary to
physical intuition, the spreading may enhance non-paraxial phenomena. For the
available electron beams, this asymmetry can in principle be reliably detected,

responses is a central challenge for current vision-based brain-machine
interface techniques. To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals,
visual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate
prediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft
visual features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or data-driven
features (e.g., features extracted from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also
assume a linear mapping between feature representation to brain activity.
However, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for
maximizing prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding
framework to predict cortical responses in a benchmark functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework, we employ the transfer
learning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and train a
nonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear
mapping replaces the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve
prediction accuracy on brain activity. Results: The proposed framework can
significantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early visual areas (i.e.,
V1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy.
Comparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding
models, we find that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher
prediction accuracy in all early visual areas, especially in relatively
anterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work proposes a new
framework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings
from visual features to brain activity.

which we call atoms and electrons. The atoms interact with photons via an
infrared regular form-factor and thus they are Wigner-type particles with sharp
mass-shells. The electrons have an infrared singular form-factor and thus they
are infraparticles accompanied by soft-photon clouds correlated with their
velocities. In the weak coupling regime we construct scattering states of one
atom and one electron, and demonstrate their asymptotic clustering into
individual particles. The proof relies on the Cook's argument, clustering
estimates, and the non-stationary phase method. The latter technique requires
sharp estimates on derivatives of the ground state wave functions of the fiber
Hamiltonians of the model, which were proven in the earlier papers of this
series. Although we rely on earlier studies of the atom-atom and
electron-photon scattering in the Nelson model, the paper is written in a
self-contained manner. A perspective on the open problem of the
electron-electron scattering in this model is also given.

time-varying abilities of individuals to influence their neighbors. To
understand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which
each voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$
is fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics
of the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive
voter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases
its fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and
slowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the
fitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the
voter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest
rank) to $N$ (lowest), where $N$ is the population size. In a voting event in
which voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,
the rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank
distribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\ldots,N$, leading to
stationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with
these two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach
consensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\exp(\sqrt{N})$. This long
consensus time arises because the average rank of the minority population is
typically higher than that of the majority. Thus whenever consensus is
approached, this highly ranked minority tends to drive the population away from
consensus.

the fact that the canonical interpolation of both nonconforming elements lacks
a crucial superclose property, and the nonconformity of both elements. The main
idea is to employ the relation between the lowest-order mixed Raviart--Thomas

superclose property of the canonical interpolation of the lowest-order mixed
Raviart--Thomas element. To overcome the difficulty caused by the
nonconformity, the commuting property of the canonical interpolation operators

control methods for three-phase inverters with an output LC filter, where a
high-quality voltage with low total harmonic distortion (THD) is needed.
Although it is an intuitive controller, easy to understand and implement, it
has the significant disadvantage of requiring a large number of online
calculations for solving the optimization problem. On the other hand, the
application of model-free approaches such as those based on artificial neural
networks approaches is currently growing rapidly in the area of power
electronics and drives. This paper presents a new control scheme for a

of getting lower THD and improving the steady and dynamic performance of the
system for different types of loads. First, MPC is used, as an expert, in the
training phase to generate data required for training the proposed neural
network. Then, once the neural network is fine-tuned, it can be successfully
used online for voltage tracking purpose, without the need of using MPC. The
proposed ANN-based control strategy is validated through simulation, using
MATLAB/Simulink tools, taking into account different loads conditions.
Moreover, the performance of the ANN-based controller is evaluated, on several
samples of linear and non-linear loads under various operating conditions, and
compared to that of MPC, demonstrating the excellent steady-state and dynamic

steps were found to be crucial to eliminate these aggregates and to provide
uniformly covered substrates for subsequent POM deposition and electrical
characterizations. This especially holds for commercially available gold/glass
substrates while these rinsing steps were not essential in the case of template

class-representative samples, called prototypes, by replacing the last layer
with a novel Hit-or-Miss layer. This layer contains activated vectors, called
capsules, that we train to hit or miss a fixed target capsule by tailoring a
specific centripetal loss function. This possibility allows to develop a data
augmentation step combining information from the data space and the feature
space, resulting in a hybrid data augmentation process. We show that our
network, named HitNet, is able to reach better performances than those
reproduced with the initial CapsNet on several datasets, while allowing to
visualize the nature of the features extracted as deformations of the
prototypes, which provides a direct insight into the feature representation
learned by the network .
