blood cells (RBCs), which are crucial for the pathological analysis of some
blood diseases such as malaria. Over the past decades, numerous efforts have
mainly focused on the study of the RBC biomechanical properties that arise from
the unique deformability of erythrocytes. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear
optical effects from human RBCs suspended in different osmotic solutions.
Specifically, we observe self-trapping and scattering-resistant nonlinear
propagation of a laser beam through RBC suspensions under all three osmotic
conditions, where the strength of the optical nonlinearity increases with
osmotic pressure on the cells. This tunable nonlinearity is attributed to
optical forces, particularly the forward scattering and gradient forces.
Interestingly, in aged blood samples (with lysed cells), a notably different
nonlinear behavior is observed due to the presence of free hemoglobin. We use a
theoretical model with an optical force-mediated nonlocal nonlinearity to
explain the experimental observations. Our work on light self-guiding through
scattering bio-soft-matter may introduce new photonic tools for noninvasive
biomedical imaging and medical diagnosis.

this area is deciding whether a given permutation of length $n$ contains a
given pattern of length $k$.
  In this work we give two new algorithms for this well-studied problem, one
whose running time is $n^{0.44k+o(k)}$, and one whose running time is the
better of $O(1.6181^n)$ and $n^{k/2+o(k)}$. These results improve the earlier

  Our second algorithm uses polynomial space and is significantly simpler than
all previous approaches with comparable running times, including an
$n^{k/2+o(k)}$ algorithm proposed by Guillemot and Marx. Our approach can be
summarized as follows: ""for every matching of the even-valued entries of the

interacting entities that can be regarded as heterogeneous networks including
human connections and biological evolutions. One of the main issues in such
networks is to predict information diffusion such as shape, growth and size of
social events and evolutions in the future. While there exist a variety of
works on this topic mainly using a threshold-based approach, they suffer from
the local viewpoint on the network and sensitivity to the threshold parameters.
In this paper, information diffusion is considered through a latent
representation learning of the heterogeneous networks to encode in a deep
learning model. To this end, we propose a novel meta-path representation
learning approach, Heterogeneous Deep Diffusion(HDD), to exploit meta-paths as
main entities in networks. At first, the functional heterogeneous structures of
the network are learned by a continuous latent representation through
traversing meta-paths with the aim of global end-to-end viewpoint. Then, the
well-known deep learning architectures are employed on our generated features
to predict diffusion processes in the network. The proposed approach enables us
to apply it on different information diffusion tasks such as topic diffusion
and cascade prediction. We demonstrate the proposed approach on benchmark
network datasets through the well-known evaluation measures. The experimental
results show that our approach outperforms the earlier state-of-the-art

fundamental techniques in handling high-dimensional data. Starting with the
celebrated Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, such reductions have been studied in

$(\ell_1)$ metric. Our primary motivation is the approximate nearest neighbor
problem in $\ell_1$. We exploit its reduction to the decision-with-witness
version, called approximate \textit{near} neighbor, which incurs a roughly
logarithmic overhead. In 2007, Indyk and Naor, in the context of approximate
nearest neighbors, introduced the notion of nearest neighbor-preserving
embeddings. These are randomized embeddings between two metric spaces with
guaranteed bounded distortion only for the distances between a query point and
a point set. Such embeddings are known to exist for both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$

open were doubling subsets of $\ell_1$. In this paper, we propose a dimension
reduction by means of a \textit{near} neighbor-preserving embedding for
doubling subsets of $\ell_1$. Our approach is to represent the pointset with a
carefully chosen covering set, then randomly project the latter. We study two
types of covering sets: $c$-approximate $r$-nets and randomly shifted grids,

polylogarithmic time. Their algorithm remained the state-of-the-art for general
graphs, as well as specific graph topologies. In this paper we obtain
significantly improved algorithms for various graph topologies. Specifically,
we show that $O(1)$-approximation to optimal backup placement can be computed
deterministically in $O(1)$ rounds in graphs that model wireless networks,
certain social networks, claw-free graphs, and more generally, in any graph

  Clearly, our constant-time algorithms for graphs with constant neighborhood
independence are asymptotically optimal. Moreover, we show that our algorithms
for sparse graphs are not far from optimal as well, by proving several lower

$\Omega(\log n)$ time, and approximate backup placement with a polylogarithmic
approximation factor requires $\Omega(\sqrt {\log n / \log \log n})$ time. Our

in the pseudo-gap phase of high temperature superconductors. Aiming to
understand this pseudo-gap phenomena, we study a holographic Fermionic system
coupled with a massive scalar field in an AdS black hole background. Depending
on the boundary condition on the scalar field mode, we discuss two possible
scenarios. When the scalar condenses below a critical temperature $T_c$, the
Fermi surface undergoes a transition from normal phase to pseudo-gap phase.
Hence $T_c$ can be the reminiscent of well-known cross over temperature $T^*$
in cuprate superconductor, below which pseudo-gap appears at constant doping.
In the second scenario, the bulk scalar develops a non-normalizable profile at
arbitrary temperature for non-zero source at the boundary. Therefore, we can
tune the Fermi spectrum by tuning a dual source at the boundary. The dual
source for this case can be the reminiscent of hole doping in the real cuprate
superconductor. For both the cases we have studied Fermi spectrum and observed
anisotropic gap in the spectral function depending on the model parameter and
studied the properties of Fermi arcs across different phases.

persistence in a changing environment. Even with eventual rescue, evolutionary
time lags can cause the population size to temporarily fall below a threshold
susceptible to extinction. To reduce extinction risk given human-driven global
change, conservation management can enhance populations through actions such as
captive breeding. To quantify the optimal timing of, and indicators for
engaging in, investment in temporary enhancement to enable evolutionary rescue,
we construct a model of coupled demographic-genetic dynamics given a moving
optimum. We assume 'decelerating change', as might be relevant to climate
change, where the rate of environmental change initially exceeds a rate where
evolutionary rescue is possible, but eventually slows. We analyze the optimal
control path of an intervention to avoid the population size falling below a
threshold susceptible to extinction, minimizing costs. We find that the optimal
path of intervention initially increases as the population declines, then
declines and ceases when the population growth rate becomes positive, which
lags the stabilization in environmental change. In other words, the optimal
strategy involves increasing investment even in the face of a declining
population, and positive population growth could serve as a signal to end the
intervention. In addition, a greater carrying capacity relative to the initial
population size decreases the optimal intervention. Therefore, a one-time
action to increase carrying capacity, such as habitat restoration, can reduce
the amount and duration of longer-term investment in population enhancement,
even if the population is initially lower than and declining away from the new
carrying capacity.

single correlation (hyper-)parameter, controlling the shrinkage towards the

desirable properties from a practical point of view: i) it ensures appropriate
shrinkage to the iid case; ii) it depends on a scaling parameter whose choice
only requires a prior guess on the proportion of total variance explained by
the grouping factor; iii) it is defined on a distance scale common to all group

an important role in processing, organizing, and communicating world knowledge.
Categories exist across cultures: they allow to efficiently represent the
complexity of the world, and members of a community strongly agree on their
nature, revealing a shared mental representation. Models of category learning
and representation, however, are typically tested on data from small-scale
experiments involving small sets of concepts with artificially restricted
features; and experiments predominantly involve participants of selected
cultural and socio-economical groups (very often involving western native
speakers of English such as U.S. college students) . This work investigates
whether models of categorization generalize (a) to rich and noisy data
approximating the environment humans live in; and (b) across languages and
cultures. We present a Bayesian cognitive model designed to jointly learn
categories and their structured representation from natural language text which
allows us to (a) evaluate performance on a large scale, and (b) apply our model
to a diverse set of languages. We show that meaningful categories comprising
hundreds of concepts and richly structured featural representations emerge
across languages. Our work illustrates the potential of recent advances in

Poisson expectations. The accompanying uncertainty from the finite Monte Carlo
sample size can be incorporated into parameter estimation by modifying the
Poisson likelihood. We first review previous Frequentist methods of this type
by Barlow et al, Bohm et al, and Chirkin, as well as recently proposed
probabilistic methods by the author and Arg\""uelles et al. We show that all
these approaches can be understood in a unified way: they all approximate the
underlying probability distribution of the sum of weights in a given bin, the
compound Poisson distribution (CPD). The Probabilistic methods marginalize the
Poisson mean with a distribution that approximates the CPD, while the
Frequentist counterparts optimize the same integrand treating the mean as a
nuisance parameter. With this viewpoint we can motivate three new probabilistic
likelihoods based on generalized gamma-Poisson mixture distributions which we
derive in analytic form. Afterwards, we test old and new formulas in different
parameter estimation settings consisting of a ""background"" and ""signal""
dataset. The probablistic counterpart to the Ansatz by Barlow et al.
outperforms all other existing approaches in various scenarios. We further find
a surprising outcome: usage of the exact CPD is actually bad for parameter
estimation. A continuous approximation performs much better and in principle
allows to perform bias-free inference at any level of simulated livetime if the
first two moments of the CPD of each dataset are known exactly. Finally, we
also discuss the situation where new Monte Carlo simulation is produced for a
given parameter choice which leads to fluctuations in the computed likelihood
value. Two of the new formulas allow to include this Poisson uncertainty
directly into the likelihood which substantially decreases these fluctuations.

such a model was able to predict responses which correlate significantly with
human judgements, both at utterance and system level. Their system was shown to
have beaten word-overlap metrics such as BLEU with large margins. We start with
the question of whether an adversary can game the ADEM model. We design a
battery of targeted attacks at the neural network based ADEM evaluation system

go. ADEM can get confused with a variation as simple as reversing the word
order in the text! We report experiments on several such adversarial scenarios
that draw out counterintuitive scores on the dialogue responses. We take a
systematic look at the scoring function proposed by ADEM and connect it to
linear system theory to predict the shortcomings evident in the system. We also
devise an attack that can fool such a system to rate a response generation
system as favorable. Finally, we allude to future research directions of using
the adversarial attacks to design a truly automated dialogue evaluation system.

and thus a challenge problem because the inferred power value of an appliance
given only the mains could not be unique. To mitigate the unidentifiable
problem, various methods incorporating domain knowledge into NILM have been
proposed and shown effective experimentally. Recently, among these methods,
deep neural networks are shown performing best. Arguably, the recently proposed
sequence-to-point (seq2point) learning is promising for NILM. However, the
results were only carried out on the same data domain. It is not clear if the
method could be generalised or transferred to different domains, e.g., the test
data were drawn from a different country comparing to the training data. We
address this issue in the paper, and two transfer learning schemes are
proposed, i.e., appliance transfer learning (ATL) and cross-domain transfer
learning (CTL). For ATL, our results show that the latent features learnt by a
`complex' appliance, e.g., washing machine, can be transferred to a `simple'
appliance, e.g., kettle. For CTL, our conclusion is that the seq2point learning
is transferable. Precisely, when the training and test data are in a similar
domain, seq2point learning can be directly applied to the test data without
fine tuning; when the training and test data are in different domains,
seq2point learning needs fine tuning before applying to the test data.
Interestingly, we show that only the fully connected layers need fine tuning
for transfer learning. Source code can be found at

of momentum- and energy-containing eddies (energy-eddies), whose sizes differ
by many orders of magnitude. These eddies follow a self-sustaining cycle, i.e.,
existing eddies are seeds for the inception of new ones, and so forth.
Understanding this process is critical for the modelling and control of
geophysical and industrial flows, in which a non-negligible fraction of the
energy is dissipated by turbulence in the immediate vicinity of walls. In this
study, we examine the causal interactions of energy-eddies in wall-bounded
turbulence by quantifying how the knowledge of the past states of eddies
reduces the uncertainty of their future states. The analysis is performed via
direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel flows in which
time-resolved energy-eddies are isolated at a prescribed scale. Our approach
unveils, in a simple manner, that causality of energy-eddies in the buffer and
logarithmic layers is similar and independent of the eddy size. We further show
an example of how novel flow control and modelling strategies can take
advantage of such self-similar causality.

known about when it can be done without affecting the convergence or the sum of

can add the even-indexed and odd-indexed terms separately, or arrange the terms
in an infinite two-dimensional table and first compute the sum of each column.
The possibility of even more intricate re-orderings prompts us to find a
general underlying principle. We identify such a principle in the setting of
Banach spaces, where we consider well-ordered series with indices beyond
{\omega}, but strictly under {\omega}_1 . We prove that for every absolutely
convergent well-ordered series indexed by a countable ordinal, if the series is
rearranged according to any countable ordinal, then the absolute convergence

illustrative simulations of polycrystalline solidification using physical
parameters for an aluminum-10wt%copper alloy. Resulting microstructures show
notable differences when taking into account natural buoyancy in comparison to

computationally and quantitatively investigating the influence of fluid flow

from a collection of documents are clustered by k-means in order to learn a
codebook of semnatically-related word embeddings. Each word embedding is then
associated to its nearest cluster centroid (codeword). The Vector of
Locally-Aggregated Word Embeddings (VLAWE) representation of a document is then
computed by accumulating the differences between each codeword vector and each
word vector (from the document) associated to the respective codeword. We plug
the VLAWE representation, which is learned in an unsupervised manner, into a

the use of collective variables. The efficiency of these methods relies
critically on an educated guess of the collective variables. For this reason
much effort has been devoted to the construction and improvement of collective
variables. Among the many methods proposed, harmonic linear discriminant
analysis has proven effective. This method builds the collective coordinates
solely from the knowledge of the fluctuations in the different metastable
state. In this Letter we propose to improve upon the harmonic linear
discriminant analysis by adding to the construction of the collective
coordinates an extra bit of information, namely that of the transition state
ensemble. Configurations belonging to the transition state ensemble are
harnessed by the use of the spring shooting transition path sampling algorithm.
We show on a challenging example that these coordinates thus augmented not only
perform better in the calculation of the static properties, but also accelerate
considerably the calculation of reaction rates.

function of temperature at large supercoolings but the extrapolation to the
melting temperature leads to a value which is considerably different from the
CFM value. This is consistent with the large anisotropy of the SLI properties
of the B33 phase nearby the melting temperature observed in the simulation of
the nominally flat interface migration.

numerical solution of time-fractional diffusion inverse problems (TFDIPs).
Computational challenges in the EKI arise from the need for repeated
evaluations of the forward model. We address this challenge by introducing a
non-intrusive reduced basis (RB) method for constructing surrogate models to
reduce computational cost. In this method, a reduced basis is extracted from a
set of full-order snapshots by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and a
doubly stochastic radial basis function (DSRBF) is used to learn the projection
coefficients. The DSRBF is carried out in the offline stage with a stochastic
leave-one-out cross-validation algorithm to select the shape parameter, and the
outputs for new parameter values can be obtained rapidly during the online
stage. Due to the complete decoupling of the offline and online stages, the
proposed non-intrusive RB method -- referred to as POD-DSRBF -- provides a
powerful tool to accelerate the EKI approach for TFDIPs. We demonstrate the
practical performance of the proposed strategies through two nonlinear
time-fractional diffusion inverse problems. The numerical results indicate that
the new algorithm can achieve significant computational gains without
sacrificing accuracy.

transition whose physics differs fundamentally from that of passive wetting
phenomena. By combining an active polar fluid model with measurements of
physical forces as a function of tissue size, contractility, cell-cell and
cell-substrate adhesion, and substrate stiffness, we show that the wetting
transition results from the competition between traction forces and contractile
intercellular stresses. This competition defines a new intrinsic lengthscale
that gives rise to a critical size for the wetting transition in tissues, a
striking feature that has no counterpart in classical wetting. Finally, we show
that active shape fluctuations are dynamically amplified during tissue

formal guarantees, in terms of a privacy budget, $\epsilon$, about how much

privacy-preserving machine learning often select large values of $\epsilon$ in
order to get acceptable utility of the model, with little understanding of the
impact of such choices on meaningful privacy. Moreover, in scenarios where
iterative learning procedures are used, differential privacy variants that
offer tighter analyses are used which appear to reduce the needed privacy
budget but present poorly understood trade-offs between privacy and utility. In
this paper, we quantify the impact of these choices on privacy in experiments
with logistic regression and neural network models. Our main finding is that
there is a huge gap between the upper bounds on privacy loss that can be
guaranteed, even with advanced mechanisms, and the effective privacy loss that
can be measured using current inference attacks. Current mechanisms for
differentially private machine learning rarely offer acceptable utility-privacy
trade-offs with guarantees for complex learning tasks: settings that provide
limited accuracy loss provide meaningless privacy guarantees, and settings that
provide strong privacy guarantees result in useless models. Code for the

phylodynamics is to estimate changes in (effective) population size. When
applied to infectious disease sequences such estimation of population size
trajectories can provide information about changes in the number of infections.
To model changes in the number of infected individuals, current phylodynamic
methods use non-parametric approaches, parametric approaches, and stochastic
modeling in conjunction with likelihood-free Bayesian methods. The first class
of methods yields results that are hard-to-interpret epidemiologically. The
second class of methods provides estimates of important epidemiological
parameters, such as infection and removal/recovery rates, but ignores variation
in the dynamics of infectious disease spread. The third class of methods is the
most advantageous statistically, but relies on computationally intensive
particle filtering techniques that limits its applications. We propose a
Bayesian model that combines phylodynamic inference and stochastic epidemic
models, and achieves computational tractability by using a linear noise
approximation (LNA) --- a technique that allows us to approximate probability
densities of stochastic epidemic model trajectories. LNA opens the door for
using modern Markov chain Monte Carlo tools to approximate the joint posterior
distribution of the disease transmission parameters and of high dimensional
vectors describing unobserved changes in the stochastic epidemic model
compartment sizes (e.g., numbers of infectious and susceptible individuals). We
apply our estimation technique to Ebola genealogies estimated using viral

clearly demonstrated based on molecular dynamics simulations and potential

freedom, which can collaborate with other phonon distortions and form a complex

Second, as pointed out by many existing studies, it is not trivial to rank
items from heterogeneous sources because the relevance scores from different
source systems are not directly comparable. To address these two issues, we
decompose the task into two subtasks in a hierarchical structure: a high-level
task for source selection where we model the sequential patterns of user
behaviors onto aggregated results in different pages so as to understand user
intents and select the relevant sources properly; and a low-level task for item
presentation where we formulate a slot filling process to sequentially present
the items instead of giving each item a relevance score when deciding the
presentation order of heterogeneous items. Since both subtasks can be naturally
formulated as sequential decision problems and learn from the future user
feedback on search results, we build our model with hierarchical reinforcement
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model obtains remarkable
improvements in search performance metrics, and achieves a higher user
satisfaction.

$s_\Omega=\|\Sigma^{-1}a_0\|_0$, provided that the de-biased estimate is
modified with the degrees-of-freedom adjustment. The dependence in
$s_0,s_\Omega$ and $\|\Sigma^{-1}a_0\|_1$ is optimal. Our estimated score
vector provides a novel methodology to handle dense $a_0$.
  Our analysis shows that the degrees-of-freedom adjustment is not needed when
the initial bias in direction $a_0$ is small, which is granted under stringent
conditions on $\Sigma^{-1}$. The main proof argument is an interpolation path
similar to that typically used to derive Slepian's lemma. It yields a new
$\ell_\infty$ error bound for the Lasso which is of independent interest.

We propose that this observation can be explained by the statistical
hadronization model (SHM), by employing a largely augmented set of charm-baryon
states beyond the current listings of the particle data group. We estimate the
additional states using guidance from the relativistic quark model and from
lattice QCD. Using charm- and strange-quark fugacity factors to account for the
well-known suppression of heavy flavor in elementary collisions, we compute the
yields and spectra of $D$, $D_s$ and $\Lambda_c$ hadrons in proton-proton
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5$\,TeV. Our main finding is that the enhanced feeddown
from excited charm baryons can account for the $\Lambda_c/D^0$ ratio measured
by ALICE at midrapidity, with some caveat for the forward-rapidity LHCb data.
Furthermore, assuming independent fragmentation of charm quarks but with the
hadronic ratios fixed by the SHM, the measured transverse-momentum ($p_T$)
spectra of $D$-mesons and $\Lambda_c$ can also be described; in particular, the
low-$p_T$ enhancement in the observed $\Lambda_c/D^0$ ratio is attributed to
the enhanced feeddown from ""missing"" charm-baryon states. We comment on the
implications of these findings for measurements of $D_s$ and $\Lambda_c$ in

defined by just adding a gluon mass term to the Yang-Mills theory with the
Lorentz-covariant gauge fixing term and the associated Faddeev-Popov ghost
term. First of all, we show that massive Yang-Mills model is obtained as a
gauge-fixed version of the gauge-invariantly extended theory which is
identified with the gauge-scalar model with a single fixed-modulus scalar field
in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. This equivalence is
obtained through the gauge-independent description of the Brout-Englert-Higgs
mechanism proposed recently by one of the authors. Then, we reconfirm that the
Euclidean gluon and ghost propagators in the Landau gauge obtained by numerical
simulations on the lattice are reproduced with good accuracy from the massive
Yang-Mills model by taking into account one-loop quantum corrections. Moreover,
we demonstrate in a numerical way that the Schwinger function calculated from
the gluon propagator in the Euclidean region exhibits violation of the
reflection positivity at the physical point of the parameters. In addition, we
perform the analytic continuation of the gluon propagator from the Euclidean
region to the complex momentum plane towards the Minkowski region. We give an
analytical proof that the reflection positivity is violated for any choice of
the parameters in the massive Yang-Mills model, due to the existence of a pair
of complex conjugate poles and the negativity of the spectral function for the
gluon propagator to one-loop order. The complex structure of the propagator
enables us to explain why the gluon propagator in the Euclidean region is well
described by the Gribov-Stingl form.

structures relies on balancing the workload of the robots and ensuring
collision-free scheduling. We cast this problem as that of allocating a large
number of repetitive assembly tasks, such as drilling holes and installing
fasteners, among multiple robots. Such task allocation is often formulated as a
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard, implying that computing an
exactly optimal solution is computationally prohibitive for real-world

robot failures necessitating real-time task reallocation. In this letter, we
present an efficient method that exploits workpart geometry and problem
structure to initially generate balanced and conflict-free robot schedules
under nominal conditions. Subsequently, we deal with the failures by allowing
the robots to first complete their nominal schedules and then employing a
market-based optimizer to allocate the leftover tasks. Results show an
improvement of 11.5\% in schedule efficiency as compared to an optimized greedy
multi-agent scheduler on a four robot system, which is especially promising for
aircraft assembly processes that take many hours to complete. Moreover, the
computation times are similar and small, typically hundreds of milliseconds.

applications in different fields like security informatics, e-learning, humor
detection, targeted advertising, etc. Many of these applications focus on
social media and treat this problem as a classification problem, which requires
preparing training data. The typical method for annotating the training data by
human experts is considered time consuming, labor intensive and sometimes prone
to error. Moreover, such an approach is not easily extensible to new
domains/languages since such extensions require annotating new training data.
In this study, we propose a distant supervised learning approach where the
training sentences are automatically annotated based on the emojis they have.
Such training data would be very cheap to produce compared with the manually
created training data, thus, much larger training data can be easily obtained.
On the other hand, this training data would naturally have lower quality as it
may contain some errors in the annotation. Nonetheless, we experimentally show
that training classifiers on cheap, large and possibly erroneous data annotated
using this approach leads to more accurate results compared with training the
same classifiers on the more expensive, much smaller and error-free manually
annotated training data. Our experiments are conducted on an in-house dataset
of emotional Arabic tweets and the classifiers we consider are: Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Random Forest (RF). In
addition to experimenting with single classifiers, we also consider using an
ensemble of classifiers. The results show that using an automatically annotated
training data (that is only one order of magnitude larger than the manually
annotated one) gives better results in almost all settings considered.

learning, character-level classifiers that are able to detect algorithmically
generated domain (AGD) names with high accuracy, and correspondingly,
significantly reduce the effectiveness of DGAs for botnet communication. In
this paper we present MaskDGA, a practical adversarial learning technique that
adds perturbation to the character-level representation of algorithmically
generated domain names in order to evade DGA classifiers, without the attacker
having any knowledge about the DGA classifier's architecture and parameters.
MaskDGA was evaluated using the DMD-2018 dataset of AGD names and four recently
published DGA classifiers, in which the average F1-score of the classifiers
degrades from 0.977 to 0.495 when applying the evasion technique. An additional
evaluation was conducted using the same classifiers but with adversarial
defenses implemented: adversarial re-training and distillation. The results of
this evaluation show that MaskDGA can be used for improving the robustness of
the character-level DGA classifiers against adversarial attacks, but that
ideally DGA classifiers should incorporate additional features alongside
character-level features that are demonstrated in this study to be vulnerable
to adversarial attacks.

on the dynamical behavior on the carrying simplex. However, this manifold is
normally non-smooth. Therefore, not every tool coming from Differential
Geometry can be applied. In particular, the classical Grobman-Hartman theorem
can not be used on the carrying simplex. In this paper, we prove that the
restriction of the map to the carrying simplex in a neighborhood of an interior
fixed point is topologically conjugate to the restriction of the map to its
pseudo-unstable manifold by an invariant foliation. This implies that the
linearization techniques are applicable for studying the local dynamics of the
interior fixed points on the carrying simplex. We further construct the stable
and unstable manifolds on the carrying simplex. On the other hand, our results
also give partial responses to Hirsch's problem regarding the smoothness of the
carrying simplex. We discuss some applications in classical models of
population dynamics. Although we focus on monotone maps, many results of the

folded with their respective super-orbital periods, are shown to be well
reproduced by a model in which X-rays from a compact object towards us are
periodically obscured by a precessing ring at the outermost part of an
accretion disk around the central object. A situation is considered in which
matter from a companion star flows into a gravitational field of a compact star
carrying a certain amount of specific angular momentum and first forms a
geometrically thick ring-tube along the Keplerian circular orbit. For the model
to well fit to the observations, it is necessary that the optical depth of the
ring-tube for Compton scattering, $\tau \simeq 1 \sim 2$, the ring matter
temperature, $T \simeq 10^{5} \sim 10^{6}$ K and the ionization parameter, $\xi
\simeq 10^{2}$ erg cm s$^{-1}$ due to X-ray heating from the central X-ray
source. From simple energetics- and perturbation-arguments, we find that a
precession of such a ring is rather stable and possible to be excited in the
$T$ and $\xi$ ranges. The time during which matter accumulates in the ring is
estimated to be $\sim 10^{6}$ s, and is shown to be comparable to the time for
an accretion disk to extend from the ring. It is discussed that in the above
$T$ and $\xi$ ranges, the ring-tube matter could become thermally unstable.
Then, relatively high density regions in the ring-tube further cools down and
tends to shrink to the tube center. The flow across the ring circulating flow
should excite turbulent motions, and angular momenta of the matter would be
effectively transferred across the tube. Finally, a steady flow should be
established from the companion star through the accretion ring to the accretion
disk towards the central compact star.

to infer a latent `true' annotation, which has been shown to improve the

baselines only in low redundancy settings, where the number of annotations per
instance is low ($\le 3$), or in situations where workers are unreliable and
produce low quality annotations (e.g., through spamming, random, or adversarial

these settings, the majority vote heuristic performs very well, and most truth

of zero sets, called $Z_B$-filters, on $X$. As a natural outcome of this study,
it is observed that $B_1(X)$ is a Gelfand ring but non-Noetherian in general.
Introducing fixed and free maximal ideals in the context of $B_1(X)$, complete
descriptions of the fixed maximal ideals of both $B_1(X)$ and $B_1^*(X)$ are
obtained. Though free maximal ideals of $B_1(X)$ and those of $B_1^*(X)$ do not
show any relationship in general, their counterparts, i.e., the fixed maximal
ideals obey natural relations. It is proved here that for a perfectly normal
$T_1$ space $X$, free maximal ideals of $B_1(X)$ are determined by a typical
class of Baire one functions. In the concluding part of this paper, we study
residue class ring of $B_1(X)$ modulo an ideal, with special emphasize on real

measured enriched by a quasi uniform factor in the 2--4 range, compared to

of these volatile enrichments, we investigate the possibility of inward drift
of particles made of amorphous ice and adsorbed volatiles, and their ability to
enrich in heavy elements the gas phase of the protosolar nebula once they cross
the amorphous-to-crystalline ice transition zone, following the original idea
formulated by Monga & Desch (2015). To do so, we use a simple accretion disk
model coupled to modules depicting the radial evolution of icy particles and
vapors, assuming growth, fragmentation and crystallization of amorphous grains.
We show that it is possible to accrete supersolar gas from the nebula onto
proto-Jupiter's core to form its envelope, and allowing it to match the
observed volatile enrichments. Our calculations suggest that nebular gas with a
metallicity similar to that measured in Jupiter can be accreted by its envelope
if the planet formed in the $\sim$0.5--2 Myr time range and in the 0.5--20 AU
distance range from the Sun, depending on the adopted viscosity parameter of
the disk. These values match a wide range of Jupiter's formation scenarios,
including in situ formation and migration/formation models.

$\alpha$ and the black hole charge $Q$. A general condition following from the

model, we can not only get some existing models, but also derive new models.
Moreover, for the incompressible model derived, a modified pressure scheme is
introduced to calculate the pressure, and then to ensure the accuracy of the
model. In this work, we will focus on a two-phase flow system, and in the frame
work of our generalized LB model, a new phase-field-based LB model is developed
for incompressible and quasi-incompressible two-phase flows. A series of
numerical simulations of some classic physical problems, including a spinodal
decomposition, a static droplet, a layered Poiseuille flow, and a bubble rising
flow under buoyancy, are performed to validate the developed model. Besides,
some comparisons with previous quasi-incompressible and incompressible LB
models are also carried out, and the results show that the present model is
accurate in the study of two-phase flows. Finally, we also conduct a comparison
between quasi-incompressible and incompressible LB models for two-phase flow
problems, and find that in some cases, the proposed quasi-incompressible LB
model performs better than incompressible LB models.

data. Here, non-compliance is defined as non-adherence to a specific treatment,
and occurs within randomised controlled trials (RCTs) when participants depart
from their random assignment. Missing data arises if, for example, there is
loss to follow-up, survey non-response, or the information available from
routine data sources is incomplete. Appropriate statistical methods for
handling non-compliance and missing data have been developed, but they have
rarely been applied in health economics studies. Here, we illustrate the issues
and outline some of the appropriate methods to handle these with an application
to a health economic evaluation that uses data from an RCT.
  In an RCT the random assignment can be used as an instrument for treatment
receipt, to obtain consistent estimates of the complier average causal effect,
provided the underlying assumptions are met. Instrumental variable methods can
accommodate essential features of the health economic context such as the
correlation between individuals' costs and outcomes in cost-effectiveness
studies. Methodological guidance for handling missing data encourages
approaches such as multiple imputation or inverse probability weighting, that
assume the data are Missing At Random, but also sensitivity analyses that
recognise the data may be missing according to the true, unobserved values,
that is, Missing Not at Random.
  Future studies should subject the assumptions behind methods for handling
non-compliance and missing data to thorough sensitivity analyses. Modern
machine learning methods can help reduce reliance on correct model
specification. Further research is required to develop flexible methods for
handling more complex forms of non-compliance and missing data.

of the Weyl semimetals. Because of the Nielsen-Ninomiya ""no-go theorem"", the
total chiral magnetic current is absent in the equilibrium state. One of the
mechanisms for generating this current is the chiral anomaly. This phenomenon
is the anomalous nonconservation of chiral charge for massless relativistic
particles. It can be realized by parallel magnetic and electric fields, and it
leads to such new transport phenomenon as the negative longitudinal
magnetoresistance. Using a simple theory (we consider both linearized and
lattice model), we have shown, that in Weyl metals with tilted dispersion
another mechanism of the chiral magnetic current is possible. It is not
associated with the chiral anomaly. The new transport mechanism is based on the
relativistic effect of electric field on Landau levels. This effect is that an
electric field changes the distance between the Landau levels, and also changes
the effective velocity along magnetic field. At presence of a tilt in the
spectrum, this velocity renormalization is differ for different Weyl points.
This leads to a non-zero resulting drift velocity. As a consequence, an
electrical current arises along the magnetic field. The induced by this
mechanism the electric current is proportional to the pseudoscalar product of
the fields and directed along the magnetic field, that differs it from the Hall
current. At the same time, the conductivity corresponding to this transport
mechanism does not depend on the scattering time like the Hall conductivity.
Thus, we have proposed a new anomalous transport mechanism in the Weyl
semimetal, which is not associated with the chiral anomaly.

approach that avoids the complexity of modeling while capturing nonlinear
factors such as hysteresis, friction and delay of the electronics that are not
easy to model. The approach is tested on a 3-tendon single-segment continuum

complexity of survey design can lead to erroneous inferences when applied to
survey data due to unequal selection probabilities, clustering, and other
design features. In particular, the actual type I error rates of tests of
hypotheses using standard methods can be much bigger than the nominal
significance level. Methods that take account of survey design features in
testing hypotheses have been proposed, including Wald tests and quasi-score
tests that involve the estimated covariance matrices of parameter estimates. In
this paper, we present a unified approach to hypothesis testing that does not
require computing the covariance matrices by constructing bootstrap
approximations to weighted likelihood ratio statistics and weighted quasi-score
statistics and establish the asymptotic validity of the proposed bootstrap
tests. In addition, we also consider hypothesis testing from categorical data
and present a bootstrap procedure for testing simple goodness of fit and
independence in a two-way table. In the simulation studies, the type I error
rates of the proposed approach are much closer to their nominal significance
level compared with the naive likelihood-ratio test and quasi-score test. An
application to data from an educational survey under a logistic regression

equation (posed on $\mathbb T$), which is well-known as a model of
capillary-gravity waves in an infinitely long canal over a flat bottom in a
long wave regime \cite{Hasimoto1970}. We show in this paper some well-posedness
results, mainly the \emph{global well-posedness} in $L^2(\mathbb T)$. The proof
basically relies on the idea introduced in Takaoka-Tsutsumi's works
\cite{TT2004, NTT2010}, which weakens the non-trivial resonance in the cubic
interactions (a kind of smoothing effect) for the local result, and the global
well-posedness result immediately follows from $L^2$ conservation law. An
immediate application of Takaoka-Tsutsumi's idea is available only in
$H^s(\mathbb T)$, $s > 0$, due to the lack of $L^4$-Strichartz estimate for
arbitrary $L^2$ data, a slight modification, thus, is needed to attain the
local well-posedness in $L^2(\mathbb T)$. This is the first low regularity
(global) well-posedness result for the periodic modified Kwahara equation, as
far as we know. A direct interpolation argument ensures the \emph{unconditional
uniqueness} in $H^s(\mathbb T)$, $s > \frac12$, and as a byproduct, we show the
weak ill-posedness below $H^{\frac12}(\mathbb T)$, in the sense that the flow

in the presence of two-dimensional Gaussian potentials. Through extensive

on the external constant force and the Gaussian potential. Within tailored
parameter regimes, the system exhibits a rich variety of transport behaviors.
In the absence of any external driving forces, the spontaneous rectification of
the particles can be manipulated by the spatial position of the Gaussian
potential. Moreover, when the potential lies at the center of the cellular
flow, the system exhibits absolute negative mobility (ANM), i.e., the particles
can move in a direction opposite to the constant force. More importantly, the
phenomenon of ANM induced by Gaussian potential is robust in a wider range of
the system parameters and can be further strengthened with the optimized

dimensional transformation is introduced to give a mapping of the function in
dimensional domain or variations of function in fractional dimension. This
mapping gives more information about signal in different point of view like
Fourier transformation. Then, the complementary fractional dimensional order of

reheating, we establish a relation between DM particle mass $m_\chi$ and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the WIMP paradigm, which also contains two
reheating parameters, the reheating temperature $T_{R_f}$ and the dissipative
constant $\Gamma_0$. Notably, for a sizeable parameter region of WIMP candidate
and cosmic reheating, this relation predicts a smaller value of $r$ in
comparing with the conventional expectation obtained by assuming DM starts out
in thermal equilibrium. Once the suppression of $r$ is measured in future
observations of primordial gravitational wave in CMB, this relation can be used
to constrain $m_\chi$, $T_{R_f}$ and $\Gamma_0$ in principle.

with the assistance of wireless cache nodes. Specifically, the requests of each
file, which is further divided into a number of segments, are modeled as a
Poisson point process within its finite lifetime. Two downlink transmission
modes are considered: (1) the base station reactively multicasts the file
segments to the requesting users and selected cache nodes; (2) the base station
proactively multicasts some file segments to the selected cache nodes without
requests. The cache nodes with decoded file segments can help to offload the
traffic via other spectrum. Without the proactive multicast, we formulate the
downlink transmission resource minimization as a dynamic programming problem
with random stage number, which can be approximated via a finite-horizon Markov
decision process (MDP) with fixed stage number. To address the prohibitively
huge state space, we propose a low-complexity scheduling policy by linearly
approximating the value functions of the MDP, where the bound on the
approximation error is derived. Moreover, we propose a learning-based algorithm
to evaluate the approximated value functions for unknown geographical
distribution of requesting users. Finally, given the above reactive multicast
policy, a proactive multicast policy is introduced to exploit the temporal
diversity of shadowing effect. It is shown by simulation that the proposed
low-complexity reactive multicast policy can significantly reduce the resource
consumption at the base station, and the proactive multicast policy can further
improve the performance.

productivity and well-being across the globe. During the 21st century, global
cooling demand is expected to grow significantly due to the increase in wealth
and population in sunny nations across the globe and the advance of global
warming. The same locations that see high demand for cooling are also ideal for
electricity generation via photovoltaics (PV). Despite the apparent synergy
between cooling demand and PV generation, the potential of the cooling sector
to sustain PV generation has not been assessed on a global scale. Here, we
perform a global assessment of increased PV electricity adoption enabled by the
residential cooling sector during the 21st century. Already today, utilizing PV
production for cooling could facilitate an additional installed PV capacity of
approximately 540 GW, more than the global PV capacity of today. Using
established scenarios of population and income growth, as well as accounting
for future global warming, we further project that the global residential
cooling sector could sustain an added PV capacity between 20-200 GW each year
for most of the 21st century, on par with the current global manufacturing
capacity of 100 GW. Furthermore, we find that without storage, PV could
directly power approximately 50% of cooling demand, and that this fraction is
set to increase from 49% to 56% during the 21st century, as cooling demand
grows in locations where PV and cooling have a higher synergy. With this
geographic shift in demand, the potential of distributed storage also grows. We
simulate that with a 1 m$^3$ water-based latent thermal storage per household,
the fraction of cooling demand met with PV would increase from 55% to 70%
during the century. These results show that the synergy between cooling and PV
is notable and could significantly accelerate the growth of the global PV
industry.

manifested a significant enhancement in text mining applications such as event
detection, opinion mining, and news recommendation. One of the primary
challenges in this regard is structuring a graph that encodes and encompasses
the features of textual data for the effective machine learning algorithm.
Besides, exploration and exploiting of semantic relations is regarded as a
principal step in text mining applications. However, most of the traditional
text mining methods perform somewhat poor in terms of employing such relations.
In this paper, we propose a sentence-level graph-based text representation
which includes stop words to consider semantic and term relations. Then, we
employ a representation learning approach on the combined graphs of sentences
to extract the latent and continuous features of the documents. Eventually, the
learned features of the documents are fed into a deep neural network for the
sentiment classification task. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method substantially outperforms the related sentiment analysis
approaches based on several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our method can be
generalized on different datasets without any dependency on pre-trained word
embeddings.

where the data originates, known as edge computing, has become an increasingly
viable option. In addition to lowering the cost of networking infrastructures,
edge computing reduces edge-cloud delay, which is essential for
mission-critical applications. In this paper, we show the feasibility and study
the performance of image classification using IoT devices. Specifically, we
explore the relationships between various factors of image classification
algorithms that may affect energy consumption such as dataset size, image
resolution, algorithm type, algorithm phase, and device hardware. Our
experiments show a strong, positive linear relationship between three predictor
variables, namely model complexity, image resolution, and dataset size, with
respect to energy consumption. In addition, in order to provide a means of
predicting the energy consumption of an edge device performing image
classification, we investigate the usage of three machine learning algorithms
using the data generated from our experiments. The performance as well as the
trade offs for using linear regression, Gaussian process, and random forests
are discussed and validated. Our results indicate that the random forest model
outperforms the two former algorithms, with an R-squared value of 0.95 and 0.79
for two different validation datasets.

practical approach to designing arbitrary-shaped all-dielectric devices.
However, CM may result in large impractical refractive indices unachievable by
current fabrication techniques. Furthermore, due to the low design flexibility
of CM, the index-matching conditions at the ports of the device can not be
realized as well. In this paper we introduce a method for tailoring the CM
generated graded refractive index, in order to decrease its maximum value and
apply index-matching, while maintaining the propagation path within the device
unchanged. This technique is applied to two arbitrary index-matched waveguides.
The full-wave simulation is performed to show the efficiency of the
tailored-index index-matched waveguides for different relative wavelengths.
