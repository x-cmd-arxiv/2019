express a nuanced range of thoughts and utterances to convey exaggerated
emotions. However, discovering the right sticker from a large and ever
expanding pool of stickers while chatting can be cumbersome. In this paper, we
describe a system for recommending stickers in real time as the user is typing
based on the context of the conversation. We decompose the sticker
recommendation (SR) problem into two steps. First, we predict the message that
the user is likely to send in the chat. Second, we substitute the predicted
message with an appropriate sticker. Majority of Hike's messages are in the
form of text which is transliterated from users' native language to the Roman
script. This leads to numerous orthographic variations of the same message and
makes accurate message prediction challenging. To address this issue, we learn
dense representations of chat messages employing character level convolution
network in an unsupervised manner. We use them to cluster the messages that
have the same meaning. In the subsequent steps, we predict the message cluster
instead of the message. Our approach does not depend on human labelled data
(except for validation), leading to fully automatic updation and tuning
pipeline for the underlying models. We also propose a novel hybrid message
prediction model, which can run with low latency on low-end phones that have
severe computational limitations. Our described system has been deployed for
more than $6$ months and is being used by millions of users along with hundreds
of thousands of expressive stickers.

spectral resolution possible at this time, and allow for detailed lineshape
analysis. We find that the mid-IR water emission lines are similar to the
""narrow component"" in CO rovibrational emission (Banzatti & Pontoppidan 2015),
consistent with disk radii of a few AU. The emission lines are either single
peaked, or consistent with a double peak. Single-peaked emission lines cannot
be produced with a Keplerian disk model, and may suggest that water
participates in the disk winds proposed to explain single-peaked CO emission
lines (Bast et al. 2011, Pontoppidan et al. 2011). Double-peaked emission lines
can be used to determine the radius at which the line emission luminosity drops
off. For HL Tau, the lower limit on this measured dropoff radius is consistent
with the 13 AU dark ring (ALMA partnership et al. 2015). We also report
variable line/continuum ratios from the disks around DR Tau and RW Aur, which
we attribute to continuum changes and line flux changes, respectively. The
reduction in RW Aur line flux corresponds with an observed dimming at visible

models. The inner edge of the H$_2$CO ring coincides with the radius where the

networks, which are graph dressed with SU(2) representations. A spin network
edge carries a half-integer spin, representing basic quanta of area, and the
standard framework imposes an area matching constraint along the edge: it
carries the same spin at its source and target vertices. In the context of
coarse-graining, or equivalently of the definition of spin networks as
projective limits of graphs, it appears natural to introduce excitations of
curvature along the edges. An edge is then treated similarly to a propagator
living on the links of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory: curvature
excitations create little loops -- tadpoles -- which renormalize it. This
relaxes the area matching condition, with different spins at both ends of the
edge. We show that this is equivalent to combining the usual SU(2) holonomy
along the edge with a Lorentz boost into SL(2,C) group elements living on the
spin network edges, underlining the fact that the Ashtekar-Barbero connection

photon frequency converter based on difference frequency generation (DFG). The
device converts 580 nm photons to 1541 nm using a strong pump laser at 930 nm,
in a periodically poled lithium niobate ridge waveguide. The converter reaches
a maximum device efficiency of 46 % (internal efficiency of 67 %) at a pump
power of 250 mW. The noise produced by the pump laser is investigated in detail
by recording the noise spectra both in the telecom and visible regimes, and
measuring the power dependence of the noise rates. The noise spectrum in the
telecom is very broadband, as expected from previous work on similar DFG

These features are explained by sum frequency generation of the telecom noise
at wavelengths given by the phase matching condition of different spatial modes
in the waveguide. The proposed noise model is in good agreement with all the
measured data, including the power-dependence of the noise rates, both in the

out in the frequency domain, where a set of alias cancellation conditions are
imposed on the kernel's frequency response. The Paley-Wiener theorem for 2-D

to the logarithm of the number of microstates per macrostate and the
``continuous'' form related to $f \ln f$, where $f$ is the particle
distribution function. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each and
discuss subtleties about implementing them in PIC codes. Using collisionless
PIC simulations that are two-dimensional in position space and
three-dimensional in velocity space, we verify the implementation of the
kinetic entropy diagnostics and discuss how to optimize numerical parameters to
ensure accurate results. We show the total kinetic entropy is conserved to
three percent in an optimized simulation of anti-parallel magnetic
reconnection. Kinetic entropy can be decomposed into a sum of a position space
entropy and a velocity space entropy, and we use this to investigate the nature
of kinetic entropy transport during collisionless reconnection. We find the
velocity space entropy of both electrons and ions increases in time due to
plasma heating during magnetic reconnection, while the position space entropy
decreases due to plasma compression. This project uses collisionless
simulations, so it cannot address physical dissipation mechanisms; nonetheless,
the infrastructure developed here should be useful for studies of collisional
or weakly collisional heliospheric, planetary, and astrophysical systems.
Beyond reconnection, the diagnostic is expected to be applicable to plasma
turbulence and collisionless shocks.

silicon reference cavities has recently demonstrated the longest optical
coherence times to date. In this work we utilize such a local oscillator, along
with a state-of-the-art frequency comb for coherence transfer, with two Sr

Through an anti-synchronous comparison, the fractional instability of both

order $3$ on elliptic curves. E.g., if $p=2g+1$ is a prime that coincides with
$char(K)$, then every odd degree genus $g$ hyperelliptic curve contains, at
most, two points of order $p$. If $g$ is odd and $f(x)$ has real coefficients,
then there are, at most, two real points of order $2g+1$ on $C_f$. If $f(x)$
has rational coefficients and $g<52$, then there are, at most, two rational
points of order $2g+1$ on $C_f$. (However, there are exist genus $52$
hyperelliptic curves over the field of rational numbers that have, at least,
four rational points of order 105.)

  multiplier: application to large contrast media",,,"10.1093/gji/ggz189",,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a waveform matching procedure, which can
provide a subsurface model with a wavelength-scale resolution. However, this
high resolution makes FWI prone to cycle skipping, which drives the inversion
to a local minimum when the initial model is not accurate enough. Other sources
of nonlinearities and ill-posedness are noise, uneven illumination, approximate
wave physics and parameter cross-talks. All these sources of error require
robust and versatile regularized optimization approaches to mitigate their
imprint on FWI while preserving its intrinsic resolution power. To achieve this
goal, we implement bound constraints and total variation (TV) regularization in
the so-called frequency-domain wavefield-reconstruction inversion (WRI) with
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In the ADMM framework,
WRI relies on an augmented Lagrangian function, a combination of penalty and
Lagrangian functions, to extend the FWI search space by relaxing the
wave-equation constraint during early iterations. Moreover, ADMM breaks down
the joint wavefield reconstruction plus parameter estimation problem into a
sequence of two linear subproblems, whose solutions are coordinated to provide
the solution of the global problem. The decomposability of ADMM is further
exploited to interface in a straightforward way bound constraints and TV
regularization with WRI via variable splitting and proximal operators. The
resilience of our regularized WRI formulation to cycle skipping and noise as
well as its resolution power are illustrated with two targets of the
large-contrast BP salt model. Starting from a 3Hz frequency and a crude initial
model, the extended search space allows for the reconstruction of the salt and
subsalt structures with a high fidelity.

vortex-antivortex annihilation) dominates, whose hallmark is a weak, turbulent

particularly large hardware complexity compared to modern ciphers e.g. AES.

active field in pattern mining. Traditionally, a level-wise approach is used to
discover all frequent episodes. While this technique is computationally
feasible it may result in a vast number of patterns, especially when low
thresholds are used.
  In this paper we propose a new quality measure for episodes. We say that an
episode is significant if the average length of its minimal windows deviates
greatly when compared to the expected length according to the independence
model. We can apply this measure as a post-pruning step to test whether the
discovered frequent episodes are truly interesting and consequently to reduce
the number of output.
  As a main contribution we introduce a technique that allows us to compute the
distribution of lengths of minimal windows using the independence model. Such a
computation task is surpisingly complex and in order to solve it we compute the
distribution iteratively starting from simple episodes and progressively moving
towards the more complex ones. In our experiments we discover candidate
episodes that have a sufficient amount of minimal windows and test each
candidate for significance. The experimental results demonstrate that our
approach finds significant episodes while ignoring uninteresting ones.

central to measure theory by deriving it from various central approximation
results related to Littlewood's three principles. A natural question is then
how hard it is to prove $\textsf{WHBU}$ (in the sense of Kohlenbach's
higher-order Reverse Mathematics}), and how hard it is to compute the objects
claimed to exist by $\textsf{WHBU}$ (in the sense of Kleene's schemes S1-S9).
The answer to both questions is `extremely hard', as follows: on one hand, in
terms of the usual scale of (conventional) comprehension axioms,
$\textsf{WHBU}$ is only provable using Kleene's $\exists^{3}$, which implies
full second-order arithmetic. On the other hand, realisers (aka witnessing
functionals) for $\textsf{WHBU}$, so-called $\Lambda$-functionals, are
computable from Kleene's $\exists^{3}$, but not from weaker comprehension
functionals. Despite this hardness, we show that $\textsf{WHBU}$, and certain
$\Lambda$-functionals, behave much better than $\textsf{HBU}$ and the
associated class of realisers, called $\Theta$-functionals. In particular, we
identify a specific $\Lambda$-functional called $\Lambda_{\textsf{S}}$ which
adds no computational power to the Suslin functional $\textsf{S}^2$, in
contrast to $\Theta$-functionals. Finally, we introduce a hierarchy involving
$\Theta$-functionals and $\textsf{HBU}$.

strong correlations lie in shifting the BCS-FFLO phase boundary towards a lower
Zeeman field and thereby enlarging the window of the FFLO phase. In the FFLO
state, our calculation features a sharp mid-gap peak in the density of states,
indicating the formation of strongly localized Andreev bound states. We also
find that the signatures of the FFLO phase survive even in the presence of an

through the basic mechanism of randomly selecting neighbors for connections.
These processes are well-understood in standard peer-to-peer network models,
but little is known about their behavior in models that abstract the smartphone
peer-to-peer setting. With this in mind, we begin by studying a simple random
gossip process in the synchronous mobile telephone model (the most common
abstraction used to study smartphone peer-to-peer systems). By introducing a
new analysis technique, we prove that this simple process is actually more
efficient than the best-known gossip algorithm in the mobile telephone model,
which required complicated coordination among the nodes in the network. We then
introduce a novel variation of the mobile telephone model that removes the
synchronized round assumption, shrinking the gap between theory and practice.
We prove that simple random gossip processes still converge in this setting and
that information spreading still improves along with graph connectivity. This
new model and the tools we introduce provide a solid foundation for the further
theoretical analysis of algorithms meant to be deployed on real smartphone
peer-to-peer networks. More generally, our results in this paper imply that
simple random information spreading processes should be expected to perform

the significant risks of mass manipulation of public opinion in the context of

during the 2018 US midterm elections and analyze social bot activity and
interactions with humans. We collected 2.6 million tweets for 42 days around
the election day from nearly 1 million users. We use the collected tweets to
answer three research questions: (i) Do social bots lean and behave according
to a political ideology? (ii) Can we observe different strategies among liberal
and conservative bots? (iii) How effective are bot strategies? We show that
social bots can be accurately classified according to their political leaning
and behave accordingly. Conservative bots share most of the topics of
discussion with their human counterparts, while liberal bots show less overlap
and a more inflammatory attitude. We studied bot interactions with humans and
observed different strategies. Finally, we measured bots embeddedness in the
social network and the effectiveness of their activities. Results show that
conservative bots are more deeply embedded in the social network and more
effective than liberal bots at exerting influence on humans.

allows for a taxon's relative abundance to be associated with covariates of

differential relative abundance, but also for differential variability. The
latter is particularly valuable in light of speculation that dysbiosis, the
perturbation from a normal microbiome that can occur in certain disease
conditions, may manifest as a loss of stability, or increase in variability, of
the counts associated with each taxon. We demonstrate the performance of our

smaller Poisson and cosmic variance uncertainties than most $z >0.4$ luminosity

light ratios as a function of $(B-V)$ color, we found a slowly decreasing rate
of growth in red galaxy stellar mass density of $\times2.3$ from $z\sim1.1$ to
$z\sim0.3$, indicating a slowly decreasing rate of migration from the blue

find that massive red galaxies grow by a factor of $\times1.7$ from $z\sim1.1$

These results are comparable with measurements of merger rates and clustering,

magnitude (MV = -5.7 +- 0.1 mag) place the system on the luminosity-metallicity

resolved metallicity and velocity dispersions paint the picture of a slightly
dark matter-dominated satellite. Furthermore, using the Gaia Data Release 2, we
constrain the orbit of the satellite and find an apocenter of 118.4+28.4-23.7

  Science with ELTs, Vienna, August 2018), to appear in the proceedings. arXiv
  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1812.06796",,,,"astro-ph.CO hep-ph physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increased collecting area of the ELTs will bring fainter high-z targets
within the reach of high-resolution ultra-stable spectrographs, thus enabling a
new generation of precision consistency tests, including tests of the stability
of nature's fundamental couplings. For example, the stability of the
fine-structure constant can be tested by looking at metal absorption lines
produced by the intervening clouds along the line of sight of distant quasars.
  In this contribution, we discuss the performance that can be expected from
the ELTs in testing the stability of the fine-structure constant, based on the
early ESPRESSO observations, and some comparative forecasts of the impact of
these measurements for representative models of fundamental physics and
cosmology.

ionizing photons with respect to the UV luminosity density assuming a fiducial
escape fraction of zero. Extending previous measurements of
$\xi_{\textrm{ion,0}}$ to the faint population is important, as ultra-faint
galaxies are expected to contribute the bulk of the ionizing emissivity. We
probe $\xi_{\textrm{ion,0}}$ to such faint magnitudes by taking advantage of
200-hour depth Spitzer/IRAC observations from the GREATS program and
$\approx$300 3<$z$<6 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the MUSE GTO
Deep + Wide programs. Stacked IRAC [3.6]$-$[4.5] colors are derived and used to
infer the H$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent widths, which range from 403\r{A} to
2818\r{A}. The derived $\xi_{\textrm{ion,0}}$ is
$\log_{10}(\xi_{\textrm{ion,0}} / \textrm{Hz erg}^{-1}) = 25.36 \pm 0.08$ over
$-$20.5 < M$_{\textrm{UV}}$ < $-$17.5, similar to those derived for brighter
galaxy samples at the same redshift and therefore suggesting that
$\xi_{\textrm{ion}}$ shows no strong dependence on $M_{UV}$. The
$\xi_{\textrm{ion,0}}$ values found in our sample imply that the
Lyman-continuum escape fraction for $M_{\textrm{UV}} \approx -19$ star-forming
galaxies cannot exceed $\approx$8-20\% in the reionization era.

processes in the core of the cluster. We also provide an estimate of the mass

matter and their properties. Both concepts are central to understanding quantum
Hall ferromagnets (QHFMs), two-dimensional electronic phases with spontaneously
broken spin or pseudospin symmetry whose wavefunctions also have topological
properties. Domain walls between distinct broken symmetry QHFM phases are
predicted to host gapless one-dimensional (1D) modes that emerge due to a
topological change of the underlying electronic wavefunctions at such

materials, probing interacting electronic modes at these domain walls has not
yet been accomplished. Here we use a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to
directly visualize the spontaneous formation of boundary modes, within a
sign-changing topological gap, at domain walls between different
valley-polarized quantum Hall phases on the surface of bismuth. By changing the
valley occupation and the corresponding number of modes at the domain wall, we
can realize different regimes where the valley-polarized channels are either
metallic or develop a spectroscopic gap. This behavior is a consequence of
Coulomb interactions constrained by the symmetry-breaking valley flavor, which
determines whether electrons in the topological modes can backscatter, making
these channels a unique class of interacting Luttinger liquids.

log(M_h/Msol)~9 during/after reionization (-13<M_UV,lim<-11); ii) galaxies
become more efficient producers of ionizing photons at higher redshifts and
fainter magnitudes, and iii) there is a significant, but sub-dominant,

largely quiescent molecular clouds like G0.253+0.016 is of critical importance.
In this paper, we reanalyse Atacama Large Millimeter Array cycle 0 HNCO
$J=4(0,4)-3(0,3)$ data at 3 mm, using two new pieces of software which we make
available to the community. First, scousepy, a Python implementation of the
spectral line fitting algorithm scouse. Secondly, acorns (Agglomerative
Clustering for ORganising Nested Structures), a hierarchical n-dimensional
clustering algorithm designed for use with discrete spectroscopic data.
Together, these tools provide an unbiased measurement of the line of sight
velocity dispersion in this cloud, $\sigma_{v_{los}, {\rm 1D}}=4.4\pm2.1$
kms$^{-1}$, which is somewhat larger than predicted by velocity dispersion-size
relations for the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). The dispersion of centroid
velocities in the plane of the sky are comparable, yielding $\sigma_{v_{los},
{\rm 1D}}/\sigma_{v_{pos}, {\rm 1D}}\sim1.2\pm0.3$. This isotropy may indicate
that the line-of-sight extent of the cloud is approximately equivalent to that
in the plane of the sky. Combining our kinematic decomposition with radiative
transfer modelling we conclude that G0.253+0.016 is not a single, coherent, and
centrally-condensed molecular cloud; 'the Brick' is not a \emph{brick}.
Instead, G0.253+0.016 is a dynamically complex and hierarchically-structured

branch luminosities exceed the Sun's by over three orders of magnitude, leading
to significantly enhanced Yarkovsky and YORP effects on minor planets. Here, we
place bounds on Yarkovsky-induced differential migration between asteroids and
planets during giant branch mass loss by modelling one exo-Neptune with inner
and outer exo-Kuiper belts. In our bounding models, the asteroids move too
quickly past the planet to be diverted from their eventual fate, which can
range from: (i) populating the outer regions of systems out to 10^4-10^5 au,
(ii) being engulfed within the host star, or (iii) experiencing
Yarkovsky-induced orbital inclination flipping without any Yarkovsky-induced
semimajor axis drift. In these violent limiting cases, temporary resonant
trapping of asteroids with radii of under about 10 km by the planet is
insignificant, and capture within the planet's Hill sphere requires fine-tuned
dissipation. The wide variety of outcomes presented here demonstrates the need
to employ sophisticated structure and radiative exo-asteroid models in future
studies. Determining where metal-polluting asteroids reside around a white

golden ratio. Maximum matchings divide the tiling into a fractal of nested
closed regions bounded by loops that cannot be crossed by monomers. These loops
connect second-nearest neighbour even-valence vertices, each of which lies on

technique, we investigate the evolution of AGN fraction as a function of
redshift and IR (8-1000 $\mu$m) luminosity in an extinction-free way. We found
that the AGN fraction (F$_{\rm AGN}$) shows no sign of strong redshift
evolution. Instead, F$_{\rm AGN}$ increases with increasing IR luminosity in
all redshifts bins ($0<z<2$).

understanding of the cosmic star formation history (CSFH), infrared (IR) census
is indispensable. AKARI carried out deep mid-infrared observations using its
continuous 9-band filters in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field (5.4 deg$^2$).
This took significant amount of satellite's lifetime, $\sim$10\% of the entire
pointed observations.
  By combining archival Spitzer (5 bands) and WISE (4 bands) mid-IR photometry,
we have, in total, 18 band mid-IR photometry, which is the most comprehensive
photometric coverage in mid-IR for thousands of galaxies. However previously,
we only had shallow optical imaging ($\sim$25.9ABmag) in a small area of 1.0
deg$^2$. As a result, there remained thousands of AKARI's infrared sources
undetected in optical.
  Using the new Hyper Suprime-Cam on Subaru telescope, we obtained deep enough
optical images of the entire AKARI NEP field in 5 broad bands ($g\sim$27.5mag).
These provided photometric redshift, and thereby IR luminosity for the
previously undetected faint AKARI IR sources. Combined with the accurate mid-IR
luminosity measurement, we constructed mid-IR LFs, and thereby performed a
census of dust-obscured CSFH in the entire AKARI NEP field.
  We have measured restframe 8$\mu$m, 12$\mu$m luminosity functions (LFs), and
estimated total infrared LFs at 0.35$<$z$<$2.2. Our results are consistent with
our previous work, but with much reduced statistical errors thanks to the large
area coverage of the new data. We have possibly witnessed the turnover of CSFH
at $z\sim$2.

to be developed. Up to now, the most widespread approaches require

metal dichalcogenides (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2) with thicknesses ranging from
3 to 10 layers. We critically compare the obtained values for the Young's

results, which are in good agreement with those reported using other highly
sophisticated testing methods. By comparing the cost, complexity and time

equations with the so-called Boris correction. The Boris correction is applied
to reduce wave speeds, avoiding an extremely small timestep in MHD simulations.
The proposed Riemann solver, Boris-HLLD, is based on the HLLD solver. As done
by the original HLLD solver, (1) the Boris-HLLD solver has four intermediate
states in the Riemann fan when left and right states are given, (2) it resolves
the contact discontinuity, Alfv\'en waves, and fast waves, and (3) it satisfies
all the jump conditions across shock waves and discontinuities except for slow
shock waves. The results of a shock tube problem indicate that the scheme with
the Boris-HLLD solver captures contact discontinuities sharply and it exhibits
shock waves without any overshoot when using the minmod limiter. The stability
tests show that the scheme is stable when $|u| \lesssim 0.5c$ for a low
Alfv\'en speed ($V_A \lesssim c$), where $u$, $c$, and $V_A$ denote the gas
velocity, speed of light, and Alfv\'en speed, respectively. For a high Alfv\'en
speed ($V_A \gtrsim c$), where the plasma beta is relatively low in many cases,
the stable region is large, $|u| \lesssim (0.6-1) c$. We discuss the effect of
the Boris correction on physical quantities using several test problems. The
Boris-HLLD scheme can be useful for problems with supersonic flows in which
regions with a very low plasma beta appear in the computational domain.

directly by a non-linear transformation of the input as well as a noise vector
that accounts for latent variability in the output. The slow thinking solver
learns an objective function in the form of a conditional energy function, so
that the output can be generated by optimizing the objective function, or more
rigorously by sampling from the conditional energy-based model. We propose to
learn the two models jointly, where the fast thinking initializer serves to
initialize the sampling of the slow thinking solver, and the solver refines the
initial output by an iterative algorithm. The solver learns from the difference
between the refined output and the observed output, while the initializer
learns from how the solver refines its initial output. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method on various conditional learning tasks,

satellite galaxies as a function of ICM density for low- ($10^9 \lesssim
M_\star \lesssim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$), intermediate- ($10^{10} \lesssim
M_\star \lesssim 10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$), and high-mass ($M_\star \gtrsim
10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) satellite galaxies with $>\!3000$ satellite
galaxies across 24 low-redshift ($z < 0.1$) clusters. For low-mass galaxies we
find evidence for a broken powerlaw trend between satellite quenched fraction
and local ICM density. The quenched fraction increases modestly at ICM
densities below a threshold before increasing sharply beyond this threshold
toward the cluster center. We show that this increase in quenched fraction at
high ICM density is well matched by a simple, analytic model of ram pressure
stripping. These results are consistent with a picture where low-mass cluster
galaxies experience an initial, slow-quenching mode driven by steady gas
depletion, followed by rapid quenching associated with ram pressure of cold-gas
stripping near (one quarter of the virial radius, on average) the cluster
center.

matter is closely related to the existence of integral representations of
Sonine type between the Dunkl kernels and Bessel functions associated with the

concerning the $\rm{L}^{\prime}_{\rm{CO}}$-FWHM correlation seems to have been
caused by the use of heterogeneous samples (e.g., different transition lines)
and/or data with large measurement uncertainties. In order to avoid the
uncertainty caused by using different rotational transitions, in this work we
make an extensive effort to select only CO($J = 1-0$) data from the literature.
We separate these wide-ranging redshift data into two samples : the
low-redshift (z < 1) and high-redshift (z > 1) samples. The samples are
corrected for lensing magnification factors if gravitational-lensing effects
appeared in the observations. The correlation analysis shows that there exists
significant $\rm{L}^{\prime}_{\rm{CO}}$-FWHM correlations for both the
low-redshift and high-redshift samples. A comparison of the low- and
high-redshift $\rm{L}^{\prime}_{\rm{CO}}$-FWHM correlations does not show
strong evolution with redshift. Assuming that there is no evolution, we can use
this relation to determine the model independent distances of high-redshift
galaxies. We then constrain cosmological models with the calibrated

for almost all national governments. The United States Department of State's
Bureau of Counter-Terrorism, maintains a list of 66 terrorist organizations
spanning the entire world. Actively monitoring a large number of organizations
and their members, require considerable amounts of resources on the part of law
enforcement agencies. Oftentimes, the law enforcement agencies do not have
adequate resources to monitor these organizations and their members
effectively. On multiple incidences of terrorist attacks in recent times across
Europe, it has been observed that the perpetrators of the attack were in the
suspect databases of the law enforcement authorities, but weren't under active
surveillance at the time of the attack, due to resource limitations on the part
of the authorities. As the suspect databases in various countries are very
large, and it takes significant amount of technical and human resources to
monitor a suspect in the database, monitoring all the suspects in the database
may be an impossible task. In this paper, we propose a novel terror network
monitoring approach that will significantly reduce the resource requirement of
law enforcement authorities, but still provide the capability of uniquely
identifying a suspect in case the suspect becomes active in planning a
terrorist attack. The approach relies on the assumption that, when an
individual becomes active in planning a terrorist attack, his/her
friends/associates will have some inkling of the individuals plan. Accordingly,
even if the individual is not under active surveillance by the authorities, but
the individual's friends/associates are, then the individual planning the
attack can be uniquely identified. We apply our techniques on various
real-world terror network datasets and show the effectiveness of our approach.

surveillance, diagnosis of movement disorders, and computer animation. While
deep learning has lead to great advances in 2D and 3D pose estimation from
single video sources, the problem of estimating 3D human pose from multiple
video sensors with overlapping fields of view has received less attention. When
the application allows use of multiple cameras, 3D human pose estimates may be
greatly improved through fusion of multi-view pose estimates and observation of
limbs that are fully or partially occluded in some views. Past approaches to
multi-view 3D pose estimation have used probabilistic graphical models to
reason over constraints, including per-image pose estimates, temporal
smoothness, and limb length. In this paper, we present a pipeline for
multi-view 3D pose estimation of multiple individuals which combines a
state-of-art 2D pose detector with a factor graph of 3D limb constraints
optimized with belief propagation. We evaluate our results on the TUM-Campus

duality, or entanglement wedge reconstruction: which part(s) of the boundary
CFT are dual to a given subregion of the bulk? This question can be answered by
appealing to the quantum error correcting properties of holography, and it was
recently shown that robust bulk (entanglement wedge) reconstruction can be
achieved using a universal recovery channel known as the twirled Petz map. In
short, one can use the twirled Petz map to recover bulk data from a subset of
the boundary. However, this map involves an averaging procedure over bulk and
boundary modular time, and hence it can be somewhat intractable to evaluate in
practice. We show that a much simpler channel, the Petz map, is sufficient for
entanglement wedge reconstruction for any code space of fixed finite dimension
- no twirling is required. Moreover, the error in the reconstruction will
always be non-perturbatively small. From a quantum information perspective, we
prove a general theorem extending the use of the Petz map as a general-purpose
recovery channel to subsystem and operator algebra quantum error correction.

between nanoparticles, colloids, and biomolecules because they can be adjusted
by the solution pH or salt concentration. While the presence of salt provides
an easy method to control the net interparticle interaction, the nonlinearities
arising from electrostatic screening make it difficult to quantify the strength
of the interaction. In particular, when charged particles assemble into
clusters or aggregates, nonlinear effects render the interactions strongly
non-pairwise. Here we report Brownian dynamics simulations to investigate the
effect that the non-pairwise nature of electrostatic interactions has on
nanoparticle assembly. We compare these simulations to a system in which the
electrostatics are modeled by a strictly pairwise Yukawa potential. We find
that both systems show a narrow range in parameter space where the particles
form well-ordered crystals. Bordering this range are regions where the net
interactions are too weak to stabilize aggregated structures, or strong enough
that the system becomes kinetically trapped in a gel. The non-pairwise
potential differs from the pairwise system in the appearance of an amorphous
phase for strongly charged particles. This phase appears because the many-body
electrostatic interactions limit the maximum density achievable in an assembly.

  Dynamic Environments","10 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As autonomous robots increasingly become part of daily life, they will often
encounter dynamic environments while only having limited information about
their surroundings. Unfortunately, due to the possible presence of malicious
dynamic actors, it is infeasible to develop an algorithm that can guarantee
collision-free operation. Instead, one can attempt to design a control
technique that guarantees the robot is not-at-fault in any collision. In the
literature, making such guarantees in real time has been restricted to static
environments or specific dynamic models. To ensure not-at-fault behavior, a
robot must first correctly sense and predict the world around it within some
sufficiently large sensor horizon (the prediction problem), then correctly
control relative to the predictions (the control problem). This paper addresses
the control problem by proposing Reachability-based Trajectory Design for
Dynamic environments (RTD-D), which guarantees that a robot with an arbitrary
nonlinear dynamic model correctly responds to predictions in arbitrary dynamic
environments. RTD-D first computes a Forward Reachable Set (FRS) offline of the
robot tracking parameterized desired trajectories that include fail-safe
maneuvers. Then, for online receding-horizon planning, the method provides a
way to discretize predictions of an arbitrary dynamic environment to enable
real-time collision checking. The FRS is used to map these discretized
predictions to trajectories that the robot can track while provably
not-at-fault. One such trajectory is chosen at each iteration, or the robot
executes the fail-safe maneuver from its previous trajectory which is
guaranteed to be not at fault. RTD-D is shown to produce not-at-fault behavior
over thousands of simulations and several real-world hardware demonstrations on
two robots: a Segway, and a small electric vehicle.

study the dependence of the hedging error on a model used for pricing and show
that the variance of the hedging errors of static hedging portfolios can be
sizably larger than the errors of variance-minimizing portfolios. We explain
why the exact semi-static hedging of barrier options is impossible for
processes with jumps, and derive general formulas for variance-minimizing
semi-static portfolio. We show that hedging using vanillas only leads to larger
errors than hedging using vanillas and first touch digitals. In all cases,
efficient calculations of the weights of the hedging portfolios are in the dual

directions and technical feasibility of future developments from the ALMA
Science Advisory Committee (ASAC), the community, and technical documents.
  The Working Group recommends that the top development priority, based on
scientific merit and technical feasibility, is to broaden the receiver IF
bandwidth by at least a factor two, and to upgrade the associated electronics
and correlator. These developments will advance a wide range of scientific
studies by significantly reducing the time required for blind redshift surveys,
chemical spectral scans, and deep continuum surveys. In order of scientific
priority, receiver upgrades are recommended for intermediate (200-425 GHz), low
(< 200 GHz), and high (> 425 GHz) frequencies.
  The Working Group recommends that the receiver and throughput developments
proceed as soon as fiscally and technically feasible. As a first step, a
technical and scientific group should be formed to formalize the top-level
requirements. A team of systems engineers should then be charged with flowing
these requirements down to the subsystems to form a consistent new set of
minimum requirements, which future development projects would have to meet.
Given that upgrading the throughput will impact many ALMA subsystems, the
Working Group recommends that a team within ALMA be charged with coordinating
and monitoring these developments. (Abbreviated)

Superionic crystalline materials having a liquid-like conductivity {\sigma} are
particularly interesting for battery, fuel cell, and other energy applications,
and we study UO2 as a prototypical superionic material since this material is
widely studied given its commercial importance as reactor fuel. Using molecular
dynamics, we first investigate basic thermodynamic and structural properties.
We then quantify structural relaxation, dynamic heterogeneity, and average ions
mobility. We find that the non-Arrhenius diffusion and structural relaxation
time of this prototypical superionic material can be quantitatively described
in terms of a generalized activated transport model ('string model') in which
the activation energy varies in direct proportion to the average string length.
Our transport data can also be described equally well by an Adam-Gibbs model in
which the excess entropy density of the crystalline material is estimated from
specific heat and thermal expansion data, consistent with the average scale of
string-like collective motion scaling inversely with the excess entropy of the
crystal. Strong differences in the temperature dependence of the interfacial
mobility from non-ionic materials are observed, and we suggest that this
difference is due to the relatively high cohesive interaction of ionic
materials. In summary, the study of superionic UO2 provides insight into the
role of cooperative motion in enhancing ion mobility in ionic materials and
offers design principles for the development of new superionic materials for

quasi-quartet CF ground state. The intensity of the lowest-energy CF transition
remarkably increases on cooling, indicating a coupling of this CF excitation to
the quadrupolar fluctuations above T$_0$. From symmetry analysis, we suggest
that the FQ order has B$_{1g}$ symmetry. Moreover, temperature-dependent study
of four Raman-active phonon modes shows that the intensities of the A$_{1g}$

a near-resonant coupling between these two phonon modes and CF transitions.

applications where they are used to explain datasets by a small number of

infinitesimally rigid nonnegative factorizations, prove that a nonnegative
factorization is infinitesimally rigid if and only if it is locally rigid and a
certain matrix achieves its maximal possible Kruskal rank, and show that
locally rigid nonnegative factorizations can be extended to globally rigid
nonnegative factorizations. These results give so far the strongest necessary

connections between rigidity of nonnegative factorizations and boundaries of
the set of matrices of fixed nonnegative rank. Finally we extend these results
from nonnegative factorizations to completely positive factorizations.

market is proposed for local energy trading among prosumers and consumers in
the distribution system. In this market, market players are allowed to share
energy with other players in the local market and with neighborhood areas. A
Two-StepMarket Clearing (2SMC) mechanism is proposed for market clearing, in
which in the first step, each local market is cleared independently to
determine the market clearing price and in the second step, players can trade
energy with neighborhood areas. In comparison to a centralized market, the
proposed method is scalable and reduces computation overheads, because instead
of clearing market for a large number of players, the market is cleared for a
fewer number of players. Also, by applying distributed method and Lagrangian
multipliers for market clearing, there is no need for a central computation
centre and private information of market players. Case studies demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed market clearing method in
increasing social welfare and reducing computation time.

dictio-nary matching to map the temporal MRF signals to quantitative tissue
parameters. Such approaches suffer from inherent discretization errors, as well
as high computational complexity as the dictionary size grows. To alleviate
these issues, we propose a HYbrid Deep magnetic ResonAnce fingerprinting
approach, referred to as HYDRA.
  Methods: HYDRA involves two stages: a model-based signature restoration phase
and a learning-based parameter restoration phase. Signal restoration is
implemented using low-rank based de-aliasing techniques while parameter
restoration is performed using a deep nonlocal residual convolutional neural
network. The designed network is trained on synthesized MRF data simulated with
the Bloch equations and fast imaging with steady state precession (FISP)
sequences. In test mode, it takes a temporal MRF signal as input and produces
the corresponding tissue parameters.
  Results: We validated our approach on both synthetic data and anatomical data
generated from a healthy subject. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to
conventional dictionary-matching based MRF techniques, our approach
significantly improves inference speed by eliminating the time-consuming

to understand dust-obscured star formation history and galaxy evolution. Based
on the near- to mid-IR imaging with 9 continuous filters of AKARI space

showing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features observed by the North
Ecliptic Pole (NEP) wide field survey of AKARI and Herschel. All the sample
galaxies from the AKARI/NEP-Wide data are selected based both on the
Herschel/SPIRE 250 {\mu}m detection and optical spectroscopic redshift data.
The physical modelling of spectral energy distribution (SED) using all
available data points from u to sub-mm 500 {\mu}m band, including WISE and PACS
data where available, takes unique advantages of the continuous near to mid-IR
coverage, reliable constraint on far-IR peak, spectroscopically determined
accurate redshifts, as well as energy balance principle by MAGPHYS. This
enables us to derive physically meaningful and accurate total infrared
luminosity and 8 {\mu}m (or PAH) luminosity consistently. Our sample galaxies
are in the redshift range z <1, and majority of them appear to be normal
SF/spiral populations showing PAH features near the 8 {\mu}m. These SF galaxies
showing PAHs in the mid-IR include various types from quiescent to starbursts.
Some of our sample show shortage of 8 {\mu}m luminosity compared to the total
IR luminosity and this PAH deficit gets severe in more luminous IR galaxies,
suggesting PAH molecules in these galaxies destroyed by strong radiation field
from SF region or a large amount of cold dust in ISM. The specific SFR of our
sample shows mass dependent time evolution which is consistent with downsizing
evolutionary pattern.

stochastic PDEs driven by space-time white noise that is formally invariant
under the action of the diffeomorphism group on $\mathbf{R}^d$. This class
contains in particular the KPZ equation, the multiplicative stochastic heat
equation, the additive stochastic heat equation, and rough Burgers-type
equations. We exhibit a one-parameter family of solution theories with the
following properties:
  - For all SPDEs in our class for which a solution was previously available,
every solution in our family coincides with the previously constructed
solution, whether that was obtained using It\^o calculus (additive and
multiplicative stochastic heat equation), rough path theory (rough Burgers-type
equations), or the Hopf-Cole transform (KPZ equation).
  - Every solution theory is equivariant under the action of the diffeomorphism
group, i.e. identities obtained by formal calculations treating the noise as a
smooth function are valid.
  - Every solution theory satisfies an analogue of It\^o's isometry.
  - The counterterms leading to our solution theories vanish at points where
the equation agrees to leading order with the additive stochastic heat
equation.
  In particular, points 2 and 3 show that, surprisingly, our solution theories
enjoy properties analogous to those holding for both the Stratonovich and It\^o
interpretations of SDEs simultaneously. For the natural noisy perturbation of
the harmonic map flow with values in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, we show
that all these solution theories coincide. In particular, this allows us to
conjecturally identify the process associated to the Markov extension of the
Dirichlet form corresponding to the $L^2$-gradient flow for the Brownian loop
measure.

hypotheses, is a core problem in statistical inference that arises in almost
every scientific field. In this setting, controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), which is the expected proportion of type I error, is an important
challenge for making meaningful inferences. In this paper, we consider the
problem of controlling FDR in an online manner. Concretely, we consider an
ordered, possibly infinite, sequence of hypotheses, arriving one at each
timestep, and for each hypothesis we observe a p-value along with a set of
features specific to that hypothesis. The decision whether or not to reject the
current hypothesis must be made immediately at each timestep, before the next
hypothesis is observed. The model of multi-dimensional feature set provides a
very general way of leveraging the auxiliary information in the data which
helps in maximizing the number of discoveries.
  We propose a new class of powerful online testing procedures, where the
rejections thresholds (significance levels) are learnt sequentially by
incorporating contextual information and previous results. We prove that any
rule in this class controls online FDR under some standard assumptions. We then
focus on a subclass of these procedures, based on weighting significance
levels, to derive a practical algorithm that learns a parametric weight
function in an online fashion to gain more discoveries. We also theoretically
prove, in a stylized setting, that our proposed procedures would lead to an
increase in the achieved statistical power over a popular online testing
procedure proposed by Javanmard & Montanari (2018). Finally, we demonstrate the
favorable performance of our procedure, by comparing it to state-of-the-art
online multiple testing procedures, on both synthetic data and real data
generated from different applications.

Modeling and observing this imprint comes with significant technical
challenges: inhomogeneous reionization must be taken into account while

to reionization. In this work we quantify the impact of inhomogeneous
reionization on the \lya forest at lower redshifts ($2 < z < 4$), where
upcoming surveys such as DESI will enable precision measurements of the flux
power spectrum. We use both small box simulations capable of handling the
small-scale structure of the \lya forest and semi-numerical large box
simulations capable of representing the effects of inhomogeneous reionization.
We find that inhomogeneous reionization could produce a measurable effect on
the \lya forest power spectrum. The deviation in the 3D power spectrum at
$z_{\rm obs} = 4$ and $k = 0.14 \ \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ ranges from $19 - 36\%$, with
a larger effect for later reionization. The corrections decrease to $2.0 -
4.1\%$ by $z_{\rm obs} = 2$. The impact on the 1D power spectrum is smaller,
and ranges from $3.3 - 6.5\%$ at $z_{\rm obs}=4$ to $0.35 - 0.75\%$ at $z_{\rm

maximizing the value function of a Markov decision process (MDP), either in
continuous settings, with fixed discount factor $\gamma < 1$, or in episodic
settings, with $\gamma = 1$. While this has proven effective for specific tasks
with well-defined objectives (e.g., games), it has never been established that
fixed discounting is suitable for general purpose use (e.g., as a model of
human preferences). This paper characterizes rationality in sequential decision
making using a set of seven axioms and arrives at a form of discounting that
generalizes traditional fixed discounting. In particular, our framework admits
a state-action dependent ""discount"" factor that is not constrained to be less
than 1, so long as there is eventual long run discounting. Although this
broadens the range of possible preference structures in continuous settings, we
show that there exists a unique ""optimizing MDP"" with fixed $\gamma < 1$ whose
optimal value function matches the true utility of the optimal policy, and we
quantify the difference between value and utility for suboptimal policies. Our
work can be seen as providing a normative justification for (a slight
generalization of) Martha White's RL task formalism (2017) and other recent
departures from the traditional RL, and is relevant to task specification in

which previously appeared in publications by Mestre, Kuwata-Wang and Satg\'e.
We produce this curve in a simpler manner by finding algebraic equations which
give a direct proof of rationality. We find that the same equations give rise
to rational curves on a class of more general surfaces extending the Kummer
construction. This leads to further applications apart from Mazur's conjecture,
for example the existence of rational points on simultaneous twists of
superelliptic curves.

the previously known examples. Namely, we subdivide all possible $A_n$ type BD
data into oriented and non-oriented kinds. In the oriented case, we single out
BD data satisfying a certain combinatorial condition that we call aperiodicity
and prove that for any BD data of this kind there exists a regular cluster
structure compatible with the corresponding Poisson-Lie bracket. In fact, we
extend the aperiodicity condition to pairs of oriented BD data and prove a more
general result that establishes an existence of a regular cluster structure on
$SL_n$ compatible with a Poisson bracket homogeneous with respect to the right
and left action of two copies of $SL_n$ equipped with two different Poisson-Lie
brackets. If the aperiodicity condition is not satisfied, a compatible cluster
structure has to be replaced with a generalized cluster structure. We will
address this situation in future publications.

use of machine learning to inform policy analysis and decision making. This
paper applies machine learning to examine travel behavior and, in particular,
on modeling changes in travel modes when individuals are presented with a novel
(on-demand) mobility option. It addresses the following question: Can machine
learning be applied to model individual taste heterogeneity (preference
heterogeneity for travel modes and response heterogeneity to travel attributes)
in travel mode choice? This paper first develops a high-accuracy classifier to
predict mode-switching behavior under a hypothetical Mobility-on-Demand Transit
system (i.e., stated-preference data), which represents the case study
underlying this research. We show that this classifier naturally captures
individual heterogeneity available in the data. Moreover, the paper derives
insights on heterogeneous switching behaviors through the generation of
marginal effects and elasticities by current travel mode, partial dependence
plots, and individual conditional expectation plots. The paper also proposes
two new model-agnostic interpretation tools for machine learning, i.e.,
conditional partial dependence plots and conditional individual partial
dependence plots, specifically designed to examine response heterogeneity. The
results on the case study show that the machine-learning classifier, together
with model-agnostic interpretation tools, provides valuable insights on travel
mode switching behavior for different individuals and population segments. For
example, the existing drivers are more sensitive to additional pickups than
people using other travel modes, and current transit users are generally
willing to share rides but reluctant to take any additional transfers.

artificial intelligence for detection of retinal disease. And to evaluate the
accuracy of a particular such system for detection of subretinal fluid (SRF)

Fluid Intelligence, a mobile AI app that detects SRF and ME on OCT scans.
Investigators consecutively selected retinal OCTs, while making effort to
balance the number of scans with retinal fluid and scans without. Exclusion
criteria included poor scan quality, ambiguous features, macula holes,
retinoschisis, and dense epiretinal membranes. Accuracy in the form of
sensitivity and specificity of the AI mobile App was determined by comparing
its assessments to those of the retina specialists. At the time of this

suggests several new ideas. First, a TD($\lambda$)-like source learning

enhances the performance of ARM2GC by omitting costs of the gates associated
with the instructions of the compiled binary, which is known by both parties

that ARM2GC not only outperforms the current GC frameworks that support
high-level languages, it also achieves efficiency comparable to the best prior

compact SFQ pulse sequences in which classical bits are clocked to the qubit at
a frequency that is roughly a factor 5 higher than the qubit oscillation

in three-dimensional insulators indicate a distinct topological phase of matter
with a non-trivial Z2 invariant that can be verified by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy or magnetoresistance quantum oscillation. In TI
nanowires, the gapless surface states exhibit Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations
in conductance, with this quantum interference effect accompanying a change in
the number of transverse one-dimensional modes in transport. Thus, while the
density of states (DOS) of such nanowires is expected to show such AB
oscillation, this effect has yet to be observed. Here, we adopt nanomechanical
measurements that reveal AB oscillations in the DOS of a topological insulator.
The TI nanowire under study is an electromechanical resonator embedded in an
electrical circuit, and quantum capacitance effects from DOS oscillation
modulate the circuit capacitance thereby altering the spring constant to
generate mechanical resonant frequency shifts. Detection of the quantum
capacitance effects from surface-state DOS is facilitated by the small
effective capacitances and high quality factors of nanomechanical resonators,
and as such the present technique could be extended to study diverse quantum
materials at nanoscale.

empirical applications in diverse fields such as statistical genetics and
statistical finance. Testing the number of components in multivariate normal
mixture models is a long-standing challenge even in the most important case of
testing homogeneity. This paper develops likelihood-based tests of the null
hypothesis of $M_0$ components against the alternative hypothesis of $M_0 + 1$
components for a general $M_0 \geq 1$. For heteroscedastic normal mixtures, we
propose an EM test and derive the asymptotic distribution of the EM test
statistic. For homoscedastic normal mixtures, we derive the asymptotic
distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic. We also derive the
asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic and EM test
statistic under local alternatives and show the validity of parametric
bootstrap. The simulations show that the proposed test has good finite sample

useful since they can provide new knowledge about the data and may ease further
data exploration and visualization. Our goal in this paper is to define a
statistically well-founded and an objective score measuring the quality of an
order. Such a measure can be used for determining whether the current order has
any valuable information or can it be discarded.
  Intuitively, we say that the order is good if dependent attributes are close
to each other. To define the order score we fit an order-sensitive model to the
dataset. Our model resembles a Markov chain model, that is, the attributes
depend only on the immediate neighbors. The score of the order is the BIC score
of the best model. For computing the measure we introduce a fast dynamic
program. The score is then compared against random orders: if it is better than
the scores of the random orders, we say that the order is good. We also show
the asymptotic connection between the score function and the number of free
parameters of the model. In addition, we introduce a simple greedy approach for
finding an order with a good score. We evaluate the score for synthetic and
real datasets using different spectral orders and the orders obtained with the
greedy method.

at ultra-low latency in unknown wireless multipath channels, which are static
over the receive duration of one packet. Here the information is modulated on
the zeros of the transmitted discrete-time baseband signal's $z-$transform. Due
to ubiquitous impairments between transmitter and receiver clocks a carrier
frequency offset (CFO) will occur after a down-conversion to the baseband,
which results in a common rotation of the zeros. To identify fractional
rotations of the base angle in the zero-pattern, we propose an oversampled
direct zero testing decoder to identify the most likely one. Integer rotations
correspond to cyclic shifts of the binary message, which we compensate by a
cyclically permutable code (CPC). Additionally, the embedding of CPCs into
cyclic codes, allows to exploit additive error correction which reduces the
bit-error-rate tremendously. Furthermore, we use the trident structure in the
signals autocorrelation to estimate timing offsets and the channels effective
delay spread. We finally demonstrate how these impairment estimations can be
largely improved by receive antenna diversity, which enables extreme bursty

kinetic theory is broken at moderate to strong Coulomb coupling: the collision
rate depends on the signs of the colliding charges. This symmetry breaking is
analogous to the Barkas effect observed in charged-particle stopping
experiments and gives rise to significantly enhanced electron-ion collision
rates. It is expected to affect any neutral plasma with moderate to strong
Coulomb coupling such as ultracold neutral plasmas (UNP) and the dense plasmas
of ICF and laser-matter interaction experiments. The physical mechanism
responsible is screening of binary collisions by the correlated plasma medium,
which causes an asymmetry in the dynamics of large-angle scattering. Because
the effect pertains only to close interactions, it is not predicted by
traditional transport models based on cut-off Coulomb collisions or linear
dielectric response. A model for the effective screened interaction potential
is presented that is suitable for the coupling strengths achieved in UNP
experiments. Transport calculations based on this potential and the effective
potential kinetic theory agree with simulated relaxation rates and predict that
the Barkas effect can cause up to a 70% increase in the electron-ion collision
rate at the conditions of present UNP experiments. The influence of the Barkas

hydrostatic equilibrium analysis of the luminous and relaxed X-ray plasma
emission extending out to a radius $0.85r_{2500}$. We examine several DM model

large positive outlier in the theoretical $\Lambda$CDM $c_{200}-M_{200}$
relation; i.e., ranging from $3.4\,\sigma - 6.3\, \sigma$ above the median
$\Lambda$CDM relation in terms of the intrinsic scatter. The high value of
$c_{200}$ we measure implies an unusually early formation time that firmly
establishes the relic nature of the DM halo in Mrk 1216. The highly
concentrated DM halo leads to a higher DM fraction and smaller total mass slope
at $1R_e$ compared to nearby normal ETGs. In addition, the highly concentrated
total mass profile of Mrk 1216 cannot be described by MOND without adding DM,

the context of a regression task, then even if there is a distribution of
targets the optimal prediction distribution is always a delta function at a
single value. Methods of constructing generative models need to overcome this
tendency. We consider a simple method of summarizing the prediction error, such
that the optimal strategy corresponds to outputting a distribution of
predictions with a support that matches the support of the distribution of
targets --- optimizing against the minimal value of the loss given a set of
samples from the prediction distribution, rather than the mean. We show that
models trained against this loss learn to capture the support of the target
distribution and, when combined with an auxiliary classifier-like prediction
task, can be projected via rejection sampling to reproduce the full
distribution of targets. The resulting method works well compared to other
generative modeling approaches particularly in low dimensional spaces with
highly non-trivial distributions, due to mode collapse solutions being globally
suboptimal with respect to the extreme value loss. However, the method is less
suited to high-dimensional spaces such as images due to the scaling of the
number of samples needed in order to accurately estimate the extreme value loss
when the dimension of the data manifold becomes large.

can be explained by the nonlinear diffusion transport model proposed by our
previous paper (Tsuji et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 128001 (2018)). In this

between the surface velocity and slope in the experiment. These facts are also
reproduced by particle-scale numerical simulations based on the discrete

profile inside the fluidized pile is measured. As a result, we show that the
flow velocity decreases exponentially with depth from the surface of the pile,
which means that a clearly fluidized region, also known as shear band
structure, is localized around the surface. However, its thickness grows
proportionally with the local height of the pile, i.e., the shear band does not
consist of a fluidized layer with a constant thickness. From these features, we
finally demonstrate that the integration of this exponentially-decreasing

one-dimensional trapping potential $V(x)$, being randomly reset at a constant
rate $r$. Stochastic resetting has been of great interest as it is known to
provide an ""optimal rate"" ($r_*$) at which the mean first passage time is a
minimum. On the other hand an attractive potential also assists in first
capture process. Interestingly, we find that for a sufficiently strong external
potential, the advantageous optimal resetting rate vanishes (i.e. $r_*\to 0$).
We derive a condition for this $optimal$ $resetting$ $rate$ $vanishing$
$transition$, which is continuous. We study this problem for various functional

oscillations (CBO) and muon losses can be reduced through application of radio
frequency (RF) electric fields, which ultimately increases the sensitivity of
the muon $g-2$ experiments. As the ensemble of polarized muons goes around a
weak focusing storage ring, their spin precesses, and when they decay through
the weak interaction, $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e \bar{\nu_\mu}$, the decay
positrons are detected by electromagnetic calorimeters. In addition to the
expected exponential decay in the positron time spectrum, the weak decay
asymmetry causes a modulation in the number of positrons in a selected energy
range at the difference frequency between the spin and cyclotron frequencies,
$\omega_\text{a}$. This frequency is directly proportional to the magnetic
anomaly $a_\mu =(g-2)/2$, where $g$ is the g-factor of the muon, which is
slightly greater than 2. The detector acceptance depends on the radial position
of the muon decay, so the CBO of the muon bunch following injection into the
storage ring modulate the measured muon signal with the frequency
$\omega_\text{CBO}$. In addition, the muon populations at the edge of the beam
hit the walls of the vacuum chamber before decaying, which also affects the
signal. Thus, reduction of CBO and unwanted muon loss increases the $a_\mu$
measurement sensitivity. Numerical and experimental studies with RF electric
fields yield more than a magnitude reduction of the CBO, with muon losses
comparable to the conventional method.

for medical decision making. One application of ML is to retrieve visually
similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to
reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. However, no
algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for
every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not
be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. In this paper,
we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images
retrieved using a deep learning algorithm, and developed tools that empower
users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly, communicating what types of
similarity are most important at different moments in time. In two evaluations
with pathologists, we found that these refinement tools increased the
diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm.
The tools were preferred over a traditional interface, without a loss in
diagnostic accuracy. We also observed that users adopted new strategies when
using refinement tools, re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying
algorithm and to disambiguate ML errors from their own errors. Taken together,
these findings inform future human-ML collaborative systems for expert
decision-making.

since the early days of computer algebra, and several algorithms have been
designed to achieve the best possible time complexity. More recently, efforts
have been made to improve the space complexity, developing modified versions of
a few specific algorithms to use no extra space while keeping the same
asymptotic running time. In this work, we broaden the scope in two regards.
First, we ask whether an arbitrary multiplication algorithm can be performed
in-place generically. Second, we consider two important variants which produce
only part of the result (and hence have less space to work with), the so-called
middle and short products, and ask whether these operations can also be
performed in-place. To answer both questions in (mostly) the affirmative, we
provide a series of reductions starting with any linear-space multiplication
algorithm. For full and short product algorithms these reductions yield
in-place versions with the same asymptotic time complexity as the out-of-place
version. For the middle product, the reduction incurs an extra logarithmic
factor in the time complexity only when the algorithm is quasi-linear.

data from the COSMOS survey were used, and the morphological parameters, such
as Abraham and Conselice-Bershady concentration indices, Gini, M20 moment of
light, and asymmetry, were analysed taking into account public catalogues.
Furthermore, a visual classification of galaxies was performed. We found that
the fraction of peculiar galaxies with clear signs of interactions and mergers
is significantly higher in AGN (38%) than non-AGN (19%) green valley galaxies,
while non-AGN galaxies from our sample are predominantly spirals (46%). We
found that the largest fraction of our green valley galaxies is located on the
main-sequence (MS) of star formation, independently on morphology, which is in
contrast with most of previous studies carried out in optical. We also found
that FIR AGN green valley galaxies have significantly higher star formation
rates in all analysed morphological types. Therefore, our results suggest that
interactions and mergers obtained in the high fraction of FIR AGN contribute
significantly to high star formation rates observed in the selected sample, but
are not the only mechanism responsible for enhancing star formation, and others
such as AGN positive feedback could contribute as well. In future we will study
in more details the possibility of AGN positive feedback through the
spectroscopic analysis of public and our SALT data.

graph completion(KGC), which is the task of automatically predicting missing
facts in a knowledge graph. However, even with a simple model like
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC(CP) tensor decomposition, KGC on existing knowledge graphs is
impractical in resource-limited environments, as a large amount of memory is
required to store parameters represented as 32-bit or 64-bit floating point
numbers. This limitation is expected to become more stringent as existing
knowledge graphs, which are already huge, keep steadily growing in scale. To
reduce the memory requirement, we present a method for binarizing the
parameters of the CP tensor decomposition by introducing a quantization
function to the optimization problem. This method replaces floating
point-valued parameters with binary ones after training, which drastically
reduces the model size at run time. We investigate the trade-off between the
quality and size of tensor factorization models for several KGC benchmark
datasets. In our experiments, the proposed method successfully reduced the
model size by more than an order of magnitude while maintaining the task
performance. Moreover, a fast score computation technique can be developed with
bitwise operations.

that by exploiting the sparsity pattern we can provide a sparse formulation for
which the associated semidefinite relaxations are of much smaller size. In
addition, we can decompose the sparse relaxations into completely decoupled
subproblems of smaller size, and in some cases computations can be done in

  http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consequential decisions are increasingly informed by sophisticated
data-driven predictive models. However, to consistently learn accurate
predictive models, one needs access to ground truth labels. Unfortunately, in
practice, labels may only exist conditional on certain decisions---if a loan is
denied, there is not even an option for the individual to pay back the loan.
Hence, the observed data distribution depends on how decisions are being made.
In this paper, we show that in this selective labels setting, learning a
predictor directly only from available labeled data is suboptimal in terms of
both fairness and utility. To avoid this undesirable behavior, we propose to
directly learn decision policies that maximize utility under fairness
constraints and thereby take into account how decisions affect which data is
observed in the future. Our results suggest the need for a paradigm shift in
the context of fair machine learning from the currently prevalent idea of
simply building predictive models from a single static dataset via risk
minimization, to a more interactive notion of ""learning to decide"". In
particular, such policies should not entirely neglect part of the input space,
drawing connections to explore/exploit tradeoffs in reinforcement learning,
data missingness, and potential outcomes in causal inference. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world data illustrate the favorable properties of learning
to decide in terms of utility and fairness.

wide diversity of service classes, leading to a highly dynamic uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL) traffic asymmetry. Thus, dynamic time division duplexing (TDD)
technology has become of a significant importance, due to its radio frame
flexibility. However, fully dynamic TDD systems suffer from potentially severe
inter-cell cross link interference (CLI). In this paper, we propose a novel
inter-cell radio frame coordination (RFC) scheme based on sliding codebook for
fully dynamic TDD 5G networks. Proposed coordination scheme simultaneously
addresses two optimization objectives of minimizing the average CLI while
reliably maximizing the achievable DL/UL capacity, by virtually extending the
RFC degrees of freedom through a sliding phase-offset RFC codebook design.
Compared to the state-of-the-art TDD studies, the proposed scheme shows
significantly improved ergodic capacity, i.e., at least 40% gain under both the
TCP and UDP protocols, and with much less signaling overhead, limited to B-bit.
The paper offers valuable insights about how to most efficiently pre-mitigate
potential CLI in Macro TDD systems.

numerical simulations of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, we present a direct
experimental and numerical assessment of Kolmogorov's first refined similarity
hypothesis based on three-dimensional measurements of the local energy
dissipation rate $\epsilon_r$ measured at dissipative scales $r$. We focus on
the properties of the stochastic variables $V_L = \Delta u(r)/(r
\epsilon_r)^{1/3}$ and $V_T = \Delta v(r)/(r\epsilon_r)^{1/3}$, where $\Delta
u(r)$ and $\Delta v(r)$ are longitudinal and transverse velocity increments.
Over one order of magnitude of scales $r$ within the dissipative range, the
distributions of $V_L$ and $V_T$ from both experiment and simulation collapse
when parameterised by a suitably defined local Reynolds number, providing the
first conclusive experimental evidence in support of the first refined
similarity hypothesis and its universality.

particle transmission trends for ambient and NaCl nanoparticles particles in
the 20 nm - 150 nm range are in good agreement with the theoretical models.
However, for particles in the 10 nm - 20 nm size range, the transmission is
lower due to the increased particle charging resulted from their exposure to
the high-intensity electric field and high charge density in the EHD driven
flow. These conditions yield a high probability of particles below 20 nm to
acquire and hold a unit charge. The transmission is lower for smaller particle
(10 nm) due to their high charge to mass ratio, and it increases as the
single-charged particles grow in mass up to 20 nm, resulting in their lower
electrical mobility. For particles larger than 20 nm, the electrical mobility
increases again as they can acquire multiple charges. The results shed insight

In order to dig into the nature of this novel bond the newly developed
multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules is applied to this
positronic system. The topological analysis reveals that this species is
composed of two atoms in molecules, each containing a proton and half of the
electronic and the positronic populations. Further analysis elucidates that the
electron exchange phenomenon is virtually non-existent between the two atoms
and no electronic covalent bond is conceivable in between. On the other hand,
it is demonstrated that the positron density enclosed in each atom is capable
of stabilizing interactions with the electron density of the neighboring atom.
This electrostatic interaction suffices to make the whole system bonded against
all dissociation channels. Thus, the positron indeed acts like an anti-matter
glue between the two atoms.

already been considered potential sources of excess Fe abundance in cool-core
clusters, distributed heating and turbulence in ICM. A good fraction of total
radio power from mini-halos can be sourced from the SNIa energy deposited in
the ICM with required energy conversion efficiency <1 per cent. The radio power
estimated from low Mach number shock acceleration in SNIa remnants is
consistent with the observations within the uncertainties in the estimates.
Some observational properties of the radio mini-halos are broadly consistent
with the SNIa scenario. It is also speculated that radio powers and possibly
detections of mini-halos are linked to star formation and merger histories of

resolve these gaps. To be able to use these tools, the authors propose a

identify a set of 8 attributes to characterize the design quality model and
based on these attributes, propose a new process to design or adapt the quality
model. Among these attributes, a new one is introduced to capture and measure
the quality model evolution and adaptation aspect: the polymorphism and the
polymorphism degree. Finally, the authors consolidate the measurement part

for both regular and hitting paths and serve as a basis for computing new
covariance and correlation measures between nodes, which are valid positive
semi-definite kernels on a graph. Experiments on semi-supervised classification

precision photometric data will be available in six bands, from near-infrared
to near-ultraviolet. The computation of precise, unbiased, photometric
redshifts up to z = 2, at least, is one of the main LSST challenges and its
performance will have major impact on all extragalactic LSST sciences. We
evaluate the efficiency of our photometric redshift reconstruction on mock
galaxy catalogs up to z=2.45 and estimate the impact of realistic photometric
redshift (hereafter photo-z) reconstruction on the large-scale structures (LSS)
power spectrum and the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale determination
for a LSST-like photometric survey. We study the effectiveness of the BAO scale
as a cosmological probe in the LSST survey. We have performed a detailed
modelling of the photo-z distribution as a function of galaxy type, redshift
and absolute magnitude using our photo-z reconstruction code with a quality
selection cut based on a Boosted decision tree (BDT). We have computed the
fractional error on the recovered power spectrum which is dominated by the
shot-noise at z>1 for scales k>0.1, due to the photo-z damping. The BAO scale
can be recovered with a percent or better accuracy level from z = 0.5 to z =
1.5 using realistic photo-z reconstruction. Outliers can represent a
significant fraction of galaxies at z>2, causing bias and errors on LSS power
spectrum measurement. Although the BAO scale is not the most powerful
cosmological probe in LSST, it can be used to check the consistency of the LSS
measurement. Moreover we show that the impact of photo-z smearing on the
recovered isotropic BAO scale in LSST should stay limited up to z=1.5, so as
long as the galaxy number density balances the photo-z smoothing.

  Using FSI Simulations: Effects of Aortic Stiffness and Peripheral Resistance",,"Cardiovascular Engineering and Technology, Springer, 2018, 9 (4),
  pp.707-722",,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose. It has been reported clinically that rupture or dissections in
thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) often occur due to hypertension which may be
modelled with sudden increase of peripheral resistance, inducing acute changes
of blood volumes in the aorta. There is clinical evidence that more compliant
aneurysms are less prone to rupture as they can sustain such changes of volume.
The aim of the current paper is to verify this paradigm by evaluating
computationally the role played by the variation of peripheral resistance and
the impact of aortic stiffness onto peak wall stress in ascending TAA. Methods.
Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analyses were performed using
patient-specific geometries and boundary conditions derived from 4D MRI
datasets acquired on a patient. Blood was assumed incompressible and was
treated as a non-Newtonian fluid using the Carreau model while the wall
mechanical properties were obtained from the bulge inflation tests carried out
in vitro after surgical repair. The Navier Stokes equations were solved in
ANSYS Fluent. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation was used to account
for the wall deformations. At the interface between the solid domain and the
fluid domain, the fluid pressure was transferred to the wall and the
displacement of the wall was transferred to the fluid. The two systems were
connected by the System Coupling component which controls the solver execution
of fluid and solid simulations in ANSYS. Fluid and solid domains were solved
sequentially starting from the fluid simulations. Results. Distributions of
blood flow, wall shear stress and wall stress were evaluated in the ascending
thoracic aorta using the FSI analyses. We always observed a significant flow
eccentricity in the simulations, in very good agreement with velocity profiles
measured using 4D MRI. The results also showed significant increase of peak
wall stress due to the increase of peripheral resistance and aortic stiffness.
In the worst case scenario, the largest peripheral resistance (10 10 kg.s.m-4)
and stiffness (10 MPa) resulted in a maximal principal stress equal to 702 kPa,
whereas it was only 77 kPa in normal conditions. Conclusions. This is the first
time that the risk of rupture of an aTAA is quantified in case of the combined
effects of hypertension and aortic stiffness increase. Our findings suggest
that a stiffer TAA may have the most altered distribution of wall stress and an
acute change of peripheral vascular resistance could significantly increase the
risk of rupture for a stiffer aneurysm.

We analyse the problem and present an algorithm that solves it. We also discuss

of mixing select for different perceptual ranges, which in turn reshape the
spatial distribution of prey and its interaction with predators. This emergent
pattern of interspecific interactions feeds back to the efficiency of the
various perceptual ranges, thus selecting for new ones. Finally, since

represented through a hybrid approach obtained by the coupling of non-linear
Shallow Water equations with the extended Boussinesq equations of Madsen and
Sorensen. The novelty is the switch tool between the two modelling equations: a
critical free surface Froude criterion. This is based on a physically
meaningful new approach to detect wave breaking, which corresponds to the
steepening of the wave's crest which turns into a roller. To allow for an
appropriate discretization of both types of equations, we consider a finite
element Upwind Petrov Galerkin method with a novel limiting strategy, that
guarantees the preservation of smooth waves as well as the monotonicity of the
results in presence of discontinuities. We provide a detailed discussion of the
implementation of the newly proposed detection method, as well as of two other
well known criteria which are used for comparison. An extensive benchmarking on
several problems involving different wave phenomena and breaking conditions
allows to show the robustness of the numerical method proposed, as well as to
assess the advantages and limitations of the different detection methods.

flux detection. Modelling the GRB multi-wavelength afterglow using the
radiative transfer hydrodynamics code BOXFIT provides constraints on physical
parameters of the GRB jet and its environment, for instance a relatively wide
jet opening angle and an electron energy distribution slope $p$ below 2. Most
importantly, the model predicts an optical flux about two orders of magnitude
above the observed limits. We calculated that the required host extinction to
explain the observed limits in the $r$, $i$ and $z$ bands was $A^{\rm host}_{V}
> 3.2$ mag, equivalent to $E(B-V)^{\rm host} > 1.0$ mag. From the X-ray
absorption we derive that the GRB host extinction is $A^{\rm host}_{\rm V} =
11.6^{+7.5}_{-5.3}$ mag, equivalent to $E(B-V)^{\rm host} = 3.7^{+2.4}_{-1.7}$

lack a secure non-volatile memory (NVM) for storing keys because of cost
constraints. Silicon physical unclonable functions (PUFs) offering unique
device specific secrets to electronic commodities are a low-cost alternative to
secure NVM. As a physical hardware security primitive, reliability of a PUF is
affected by thermal noise and changes in environmental conditions;
consequently, PUF responses cannot be directly employed as cryptographic keys.
A fuzzy extractor can turn noisy PUF responses into usable cryptographic keys.
However, a fuzzy extractor is not immediately mountable on (highly) resource
constrained devices due to its implementation overhead. We present a
methodology for constructing a lightweight and secure PUF key generator for
resource limited devices. In particular, we focus on PUFs constructed from
pervasively embedded SRAM in modern microcontroller units and use a batteryless

spectrum was observed on fast timescales (~ days) in the active galaxy, IRAS

consider only a uniform deployment to maximize the covered area while ignoring
the criticality of specific locations during the deployment process. To
overcome these limitations, we present a framework for autonomously deploy
robots or vehicles using virtual force. The framework is composed of two
stages. In the first stage, a two-hop Cooperative Virtual Force based Robots
Deployment (Two-hop COVER) is employed where a cooperative relation between
robots and neighboring landmarks is established to satisfy mission
requirements. The second stage complements the first stage and ensures perfect
demand satisfaction by utilizing the Trace Fingerprint technique which
collected traces while each robot traversing the deployment area. Finally, a
fairness-aware version of Two-hop COVER is presented to consider scenarios
where the mission requirements are greater than the available resources (i.e.
robots). We evaluate our framework via extensive simulations. The results

account the Pareto tails of losses and the heterogeneous dependence structures
between them. We then derive estimators for individual as well as aggregated
tail risk, measured in terms of Value-at-Risk and Conditional-Tail-Expectation
for very high confidence levels, and provide also an asymptotically full
capital allocation method. Estimation methods for such tail risk measures and
capital allocations are also proposed and tested on simulated data. Finally, by
having access to real-world operational risk losses from the Italian banking
system, we show that even with a small number of observations, the proposed
estimation methods produce reliable estimates, and that quantifying dependence
by means of the empirical network has a big impact on estimates at both
individual and aggregate level, as well as for capital allocations.

interactions are independent of their heavy-quark spin (heavy-quark spin
symmetry) and heavy flavour contents (heavy flavour symmetry). In the molecular
hypothesis the $X(3872)$ resonance is a $1^{++}$ $D^*\bar{D}$ bound state. If
this is the case, the application of heavy-quark symmetry to a molecular
$X(3872)$ suggests the existence of a series of partner states, the most
obvious of which is a possible $2^{++}$ $D^*\bar{D}^*$ bound state for which
the two-body potential is identical to that of the $1^{++}$ $D^*\bar{D}$
system, the reason being that these two heavy hadron-antihadron states have
identical light-spin content. As already discussed in the literature this leads
to the prediction of a partner state at $4012\,{\rm MeV}$, at least in the
absence of other dynamical effects which might affect the location of this
molecule. However the prediction of further heavy-quark symmetry partners
cannot be done solely on the basis of symmetry and requires additional
information. We propose to use the one boson exchange model to fill this gap,

correctly reproduce the location and quantum numbers of the isovector

Boolean algebras, and Heyting algebras. Many geometric categories such as the
category of topological spaces, metric spaces, ordered sets, any topos, ect.,
are comajority categories (i.e.~their duals are majority categories), and we
show that, under mild assumptions, the only categories which are both majority

alternative generalization of arithmetical categories to protoarithmetical
categories in the sense of Bourn. We show that every Mal'tsev majority category
is protoarithmetical, provide a counter-example for the converse implication,

We can then conclude that a category is arithmetical if and only if it is a

resolve small-scale problems, especially the core-cusp problem. This is because
ULA dark matter can create a central soliton core in all dark matter haloes
stemmed from the quantum pressure against gravity below the de Broglie
wavelength, which becomes manifest on astrophysical scales with axion mass
range $\sim10^{-22}$ eV. In this work, we apply our non-spherical dynamical
models to the kinematic data of eight classical dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) to
obtain more reliable and realistic limits on ULA particle mass. This is
motivated by the reasons that the light distributions of the dSphs are not
spherical, nor are the shapes of dark matter haloes predicted by ULA dark
matter simulations. Compared with the previous studies on ULA dark matter
assuming spherical mass models, our result is less stringent than those
constraints due to the uncertainties on non-sphericity. On the other hand,
remarkably, we find that the dSphs would prefer to have a flattened dark matter
halo rather than a spherical one, especially Draco favours a strongly elongated
dark matter halo caused naively by the assumption of a soliton-core profile.
Moreover, our consequent non-spherical core profiles are much more flattened
than numerical predictions based on ULA dark matter, even though there are
still uncertainties on the estimation of dark matter halo structure. To
alleviate this discrepancy, further understanding of baryonic and/or ULA dark
matter physics on small mass scales might be needed.

advantages of using DCT are that (i) the complex arithmetic is not involved in

performance would be better than that by using the periodic boundary condition

further given to illustrate that the efficiency by using DCT is two times
faster than that by using DFT and also the errors of video and multispectral

specification and development of event-based systems with local data states.
The logic is intended to cover a broad range of abstraction levels from
abstract requirements specifications up to constructive specifications. Our
logic uses diamond and box modalities over structured actions adopted from
dynamic logic. Atomic actions are pairs $e /\psi$ where $e$ is an event and
$\psi$ a state transition predicate capturing the allowed reactions to the
event. To write concrete specifications of recursive process structures we
integrate (control) state variables and binders of hybrid logic. The semantic
interpretation relies on event/data transition systems; specification
refinement is defined by model class inclusion. For the presentation of
constructive specifications we propose operational event/data specifications
allowing for familiar, diagrammatic representations by state transition graphs.
We show that $\mathcal{E}^{\downarrow}$-logic is powerful enough to
characterise the semantics of an operational specification by a single
$\mathcal{E}^{\downarrow}$-sentence. Thus the whole development process can
rely on $\mathcal{E}^{\downarrow}$-logic and its semantics as a common basis.
This includes also a variety of implementation constructors to support, among
others, event refinement and parallel composition.

the Narrow Line Region (NLR) in obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) yields
compelling evidence that relatively low-density gas co-exists with higher
density gas on scales as large as 100s of pc. This is commonly interpreted as
evidence for a constant gas pressure multiphase medium, likely produced by
thermal instability. Alternatively, Radiation Pressure Compression (RPC) also
leads to a density distribution, since a gas pressure (and hence density)
gradient must arise within each cloud to counteract the incident ionising
radiation pressure. RPC leads to a well-defined ionization distribution, and a
Differential Emission Measure (DEM) distribution with a universal slope of
$\sim-0.9$, weakly dependent on the gas properties and the illuminating
radiation field. In contrast, a multiphase medium does not predict the form of
the DEM. The observed DEMs of obscured AGN with XMM-Newton RGS spectra (the
CHRESOS sample) are in striking agreement with the predicted RPC DEM, providing
a clear signature that RPC is the dominant mechanism for the observed range of
densities in the X-ray NLR. In contrast with the constant gas pressure
multiphase medium, RPC further predicts an increasing gas pressure with
decreasing ionization, which can be tested with future X-ray missions using
density diagnostics.

sharing scheme is also proposed to handle the overlapping computations among
the adjacent time steps, which enables our framework to run more efficiently.
Moreover, to enhance the performance of our framework for action prediction
with the skeletal input data, a hierarchy of dilated tree convolutions are also
designed to learn the multi-level structured semantic representations over the
skeleton joints at each frame. Our proposed approach is evaluated on four
challenging datasets. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method for skeleton-based online action prediction.

given an initial state, which final states can be reached by the dynamic system

systems following a unital Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation extended by
controls. More precisely, their time evolution shall be governed by an
inevitable potentially unbounded Hamiltonian drift term $H_0$, finitely many
bounded control Hamiltonians $H_j$ allowing for (at least) piecewise constant
control amplitudes $u_j(t)\in{\mathbb R}$ plus a bang-bang (i.e. on-off)
switchable noise term $\mathbf{\Gamma}_V$ in Kossakowski-Lindblad form.
Generalizing standard majorization results from finite to infinite dimensions,
we show that such bilinear quantum control systems allow to approximately reach
any target state majorized by the initial one, as up to now only has been known
in finite dimensional analogues.---The proof of the result is currently limited
to the control Hamiltonians $ H_j$ being bounded and noise terms
$\mathbf{\Gamma}_V$ with compact normal $V$.

presented. The technique is based on the use of the Rational-Dilation Wavelet
Transform (RADWT), equipped with a tunable Q-factor able to provide sparse
representations of functions with different oscillations persistence. In
particular, two different frames are obtained by two RADWT with different
Q-factors that give sparse representations of functions with low and high
resonance. It is assumed that the signals are measured simultaneously on
several independent channels and that they share the low resonance component
and the spectral characteristics of the high resonance component. Then, a
regression analysis is performed by means of the grouped lasso penalty.
Furthermore, a result of asymptotic optimality of the estimator is presented
using reasonable assumptions and exploiting recent results on group-lasso like

methods) have been proposed in the literature as a scalable alternative to
classic Krylov subspace algorithms for iteratively computing the solution to a
large linear system in parallel. For symmetric and positive definite system
matrices the pipelined Conjugate Gradient method outperforms its classic
Conjugate Gradient counterpart on large scale distributed memory hardware by
overlapping global communication with essential computations like the
matrix-vector product, thus hiding global communication. A well-known drawback
of the pipelining technique is the (possibly significant) loss of numerical
stability. In this work a numerically stable variant of the pipelined Conjugate
Gradient algorithm is presented that avoids the propagation of local rounding
errors in the finite precision recurrence relations that construct the Krylov
subspace basis. The multi-term recurrence relation for the basis vector is
replaced by two-term recurrences, improving stability without increasing the
overall computational cost of the algorithm. The proposed modification ensures
that the pipelined Conjugate Gradient method is able to attain a highly
accurate solution independently of the pipeline length. Numerical experiments
demonstrate a combination of excellent parallel performance and improved
maximal attainable accuracy for the new pipelined Conjugate Gradient algorithm.
This work thus resolves one of the major practical restrictions for the
useability of pipelined Krylov subspace methods.

data mining. Such assessment is particularly vital when mining itemsets, since
commonly many of the discovered patterns can be easily explained by background
knowledge. The simplest approach to screen uninteresting patterns is to compare
the observed frequency against the independence model. Since the parameters for
the independence model are the column margins, we can view such screening as a
way of using the column margins as background knowledge.
  In this paper we study techniques for more flexible approaches for infusing
background knowledge. Namely, we show that we can efficiently use additional
knowledge such as row margins, lazarus counts, and bounds of ones. We
demonstrate that these statistics describe forms of data that occur in practice
and have been studied in data mining.
  To infuse the information efficiently we use a maximum entropy approach. In
its general setting, solving a maximum entropy model is infeasible, but we
demonstrate that for our setting it can be solved in polynomial time.
Experiments show that more sophisticated models fit the data better and that
using more information improves the frequency prediction of itemsets.

proton-induced $\alpha$-knockout reactions provide direct manifestation of
$\alpha$-cluster formation in nuclei. In recent and future experiments,
$\alpha$-knockout data are available for neutron-rich beryllium isotopes. In
$^{12}$Be , rich phenomena are induced by the formation of $\alpha$-clusters
surrounded by neutrons, for instance, breaking of the neutron magic number
$N=8$.
  Purpose: Our objective is to provide direct probing of the $\alpha$-cluster
formation in the $^{12}$Be target through associating the structure information
obtained by a microscopic theory with the experimental observables of
$\alpha$-knockout reactions.
  Method: We formulate a new wave function of the
Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R{\""o}pke (THSR) type for the structure calculation of
${}^{12}$Be nucleus and integrate it with the distorted wave impulse
approximation framework for the $\alpha$-knockout reaction calculation of
$^{12}$Be$(p,p\alpha)^{8}$He.
  Results: We reproduce the low-lying spectrum of the $^{12}$Be nucleus using
the THSR wave function and discuss the cluster structure of the ground state.
Based on the microscopic wave function, the optical potentials and
$\alpha$-cluster wave function are determined and utilized in the calculation
of ${}^{12}$Be($p,p\alpha$)${}^{8}$He reaction at 250 MeV. The possibility of
probing the clustering state of $^{12}$Be through this reaction is demonstrated
by analysis of the triple differential cross sections that are sensitively
dependent on the $\alpha$-cluster amplitude at the nuclear surface.
  Conclusions: This study provides a feasible approach to validate directly the
theoretical predictions of clustering features in the $^{12}$Be nucleus through
the $\alpha$-knockout reaction.

several issues that previous clustering/classification methods have not
considered. In fuzzy clustering, object's membership values should sum to 1.
Hence, any object may obtain full membership in at most one cluster.
Possibilistic clustering methods remove this restriction. However, BFPM differs
from previous fuzzy and possibilistic clustering approaches by allowing the
membership function to take larger values with respect to all clusters.
Furthermore, in BFPM, a data object can have full membership in multiple
clusters or even in all clusters. BFPM relaxes the boundary conditions
(restrictions) in membership assignment. The proposed methodology satisfies the
necessity of obtaining full memberships and overcomes the issues with
conventional methods on dealing with overlapping. Analysing the objects'
movements from their own cluster to another (mutation) is also proposed in this
paper. BFPM has been applied in different domains in geometry, set theory,
anomaly detection, risk management, diagnosis diseases, and other disciplines.
Validity and comparison indexes have been also used to evaluate the accuracy of
BFPM. BFPM has been evaluated in terms of accuracy, fuzzification constant
(different norms), objects' movement analysis, and covering diversity. The
promising results prove the importance of considering the proposed methodology

recover the individual activity of hundreds of neurons in a cortical region.
Current methods (mostly matrix factorization) are aimed at detecting neurons in
the field-of-view and then inferring the corresponding time-traces. In this
paper, we reverse the modeling and instead aim to minimize the spatial
inference, while focusing on finding the set of temporal traces present in the
data. We reframe the problem in a dictionary learning setting, where the
dictionary contains the time-traces and the sparse coefficient are spatial
maps. We adapt dictionary learning to calcium imaging by introducing
constraints on the norms and correlations of the time-traces, and incorporating
a hierarchical spatial filtering model that correlates the time-trace usage
over the field-of-view. We demonstrate on synthetic and real data that our
solution has advantages regarding initialization, implicitly inferring number
of neurons and simultaneously detecting different neuronal types.

evolution. We show that the MSP will not be confined in a planar Keplerian
orbit and its spin will exhibit precession and nutation induced by spin-orbit
coupling and spin-curvature interaction. These spin and orbital behaviours will
manifest observationally in the temporal variations in the MSP's pulsed
emission and, with certain geometries, in the self-occultation of the pulsar's
emitting poles. Radio pulsar timing observations will be able to detect such
signatures. These extreme-mass-ratio binaries (EMRBs) and
intermediate-mass-ratio binaries (IMRBs) are also strong gravitational wave
sources. Combining radio pulsar timing and gravitational wave observations will
allow us to determine the dynamics of these systems in high precision and hence
the subtle behaviours of spinning masses in strong gravity.

learning network's (DLN) parameter gradients) to mislead the DLN during test
time. Intuitively, constraining the dimensionality of inputs or parameters of a
network reduces the 'space' in which adversarial examples exist. Guided by this
intuition, we demonstrate that discretization greatly improves the robustness
of DLNs against adversarial attacks. Specifically, discretizing the input space
(or allowed pixel levels from 256 values or 8-bit to 4 values or 2-bit)
extensively improves the adversarial robustness of DLNs for a substantial range
of perturbations for minimal loss in test accuracy. Furthermore, we find that
Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) and related variants are intrinsically more
robust than their full precision counterparts in adversarial scenarios.
Combining input discretization with BNNs furthers the robustness even waiving
the need for adversarial training for certain magnitude of perturbation values.
We evaluate the effect of discretization on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and
Imagenet datasets. Across all datasets, we observe maximal adversarial
resistance with 2-bit input discretization that incurs an adversarial accuracy
loss of just ~1-2% as compared to clean test accuracy.

set of high-quality itemsets. In this paper we propose a new and general
approach for measuring the quality of itemsets. The method is solidly founded
in Bayesian statistics and decreases monotonically, allowing for efficient
discovery of all interesting itemsets. The measure is defined by connecting
statistical models and collections of itemsets. This allows us to score
individual itemsets with the probability of them occuring in random models
built on the data.
  As a concrete example of this framework we use exponential models. This class
of models possesses many desirable properties. Most importantly, Occam's razor
in Bayesian model selection provides a defence for the pattern explosion. As
general exponential models are infeasible in practice, we use decomposable
models; a large sub-class for which the measure is solvable. For the actual
computation of the score we sample models from the posterior distribution using
an MCMC approach.
  Experimentation on our method demonstrates the measure works in practice and
results in interpretable and insightful itemsets for both synthetic and

light of preceding experiences regarding the experimental research of

about the phenomenological properties of astrophysical events, I propose a
comparison between that result and the previous experimental research by the
interferometer GW community, using a fundamental energy emission law, and
including about fifteen years of accredited results regarding coincident
detection. From the present review, an intense and old pre-existing activity in
the field of multimessenger observations emerges giving a first interesting
fact. The widespread opinion that joint detection of GW170817 and GRB 170817A
has opened a new method in astrophysics does not find a robust reason.
Moreover, some critical points highlight. In the past, applying the same
multimessenger method, numerous measures have been taken towards much brighter
and much closer sources. Then, it would have been plausible to see joint
signals even taking into account a worse sensitivity of the instruments of the
time. At current time, there is only one event associated to a subthreshold
GRB, compared to a long list of candidate events that would have been much more
revealing. If these inconsistencies are admissible enough to lead to a claim,
then the question arises about the interpretation of the long previous
measurements carried out applying the same multimessenger observation method

Differential Detection (MSDD) to bridge the performance gap between coherent

channels. Second, we consider multi-antenna systems to combat fading and
improve the transmission reliability. The resulting performance improvement
(known as diversity) does not require additional bandwidth nor power. Achieving
diversity using multiple antennas at the receiver (receive diversity) is proved
to be a much simpler task than using multiple antennas at the transmitter
(transmit diversity). However, in downlink mobile communications, mounting
multiple antennas on the receiving mobile handsets results in an increase in
the size and cost of mobiles. This motivates the need of transmit diversity,
which can be achieved by a technique known as Space-Time Coding (STC). In this
thesis, we investigate a class of ST codes known as Orthogonal Space-Time Block
Codes (OSTBC), which achieves a good performance with linear decoding
complexity. As an attempt to increase the data rate, the orthogonality
requirement of OSTBCs is relaxed leading to the so-called Quasi-Orthogonal
STBCs (QOSTBC). Recently a new class of QOSTBCs known as Minimum Decoding
Complexity QOSTBCs (MDC-QOSTBC) has proved to increase the data rate with the
same complexity requirement of OSTBCs. In this thesis, we propose the use of
MDC-QOSTBC in differential non-coherent systems and show that their performance

CFs of the desired signal (DS) and the noise, where the DS is the product of

information space based on a signaling game framework with a detector that
gives off probabilistic evidence of the deception when the sender acts
deceptively. We then focus on a class of continuous one-dimensional information
space and take into account the cost of deception in the signaling game. We
finally explore the multi-stage incomplete-information Bayesian game model for
defensive deception for advanced persistent threats (APTs). We use the perfect
Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE) as the solution concept for the deception
games and analyze the strategic equilibrium behaviors for both the deceivers
and the deceivees.

uncertainty on data. In particular, the SS-VRPTW-CR considers stochastic
customers with time windows and does not make any assumption on their reveal
times, which are stochastic as well. Based on customer request probabilities,
we look for an a priori solution composed preventive vehicle routes, minimizing
the expected number of unsatisfied customer requests at the end of the day. A
route describes a sequence of strategic vehicle relocations, from which nearby
requests can be rapidly reached. Instead of reoptimizing online, a so-called
recourse strategy defines the way the requests are handled, whenever they
appear. In this paper, we describe a new recourse strategy for the SS-VRPTW-CR,
improving vehicle routes by skipping useless parts. We show how to compute the
expected cost of a priori solutions, in pseudo-polynomial time, for this
recourse strategy. We introduce a new meta-heuristic, called Progressive Focus

solving static stochastic optimization problems. PFS accelerates the search by
using approximation factors: from an initial rough simplified problem, the

the proposed core adopts a height-based approach. The move to a height-based
vertical coordinate is motivated by its potential for improving model stability
over steep terrain, which is expected to become more prevalent with the
increasing demand for very high resolution forecasting systems. A dynamical
core with height-based vertical coordinate generally requires an iterative
solution approach. In addition to a three-dimensional iterative solver, a
simplified approach has been devised allowing the use of a direct solver for
the new dynamical core that separates a three-dimensional elliptic boundary
value problem into a set of two-dimensional independent Helmholtz problems. The
new dynamical core is evaluated using numerical experiments that include
two-dimensional nonhydrostatic theoretical cases as well as 25-km resolution
global forecasts. For a wide range of horizontal grid resolutions---from a few
meters to up to 25 km---the results from the direct solution approach is found
to be equivalent to the iterative approach for the new dynamical core.
Furthermore, results from the numerical experiments confirm that the new

graph. Being able to predict unseen links with good accuracy has important
applications in several domains such as social media, security, transportation,
and recommendation systems. A common approach is to use features based on the
common neighbors of an unconnected pair of nodes to predict whether the pair
will form a link in the future. In this paper, we present an approach for link
prediction that relies on higher-order analysis of the graph topology, well
beyond common neighbors. We treat the link prediction problem as a supervised
classification problem, and we propose a set of features that depend on the
patterns or motifs that a pair of nodes occurs in. By using motifs of sizes 3,
4, and 5, our approach captures a high level of detail about the graph topology
within the neighborhood of the pair of nodes, which leads to a higher
classification accuracy. In addition to proposing the use of motif-based
features, we also propose two optimizations related to constructing the
classification dataset from the graph. First, to ensure that positive and
negative examples are treated equally when extracting features, we propose
adding the negative examples to the graph as an alternative to the common
approach of removing the positive ones. Second, we show that it is important to
control for the shortest-path distance when sampling pairs of nodes to form
negative examples, since the difficulty of prediction varies with the
shortest-path distance. We experimentally demonstrate that using off-the-shelf
classifiers with a well constructed classification dataset results in up to 10
percentage points increase in accuracy over prior topology-based and feature
learning methods.

received much attention in recent years. Because of the increase in the cost of
raw materials and energy carriers, the reuse of large portions of reclaimed
asphalt pavement (RAP) is critical in reducing both the cost and environmental
footprint of asphalt pavements. High-RAP mixtures are more prone to low
temperature cracking and poor mixture workability because of the higher
stiffness of RAP binder. Recycling agents are one of the additives which are
used to improve these deficiencies. However, there is some ambiguity about the
optimum content of recycling agent to assure proper performance of recycled
asphalt pavement during its service life. The current study used 60% and 100%
fractionated RAP with waste cooking oil as a recycling agent and crumb rubber
to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Laboratory evaluation showed that
increasing the amount of recycling agent in the high-RAP mixtures improved
their workability and low temperature performance while decreasing moisture
damage and rutting resistance. The long-term susceptibility to aging of
recycled binder with the organically-based recycling agent was also
investigated. A procedure to obtain the optimum percentage of recycling agent
was devised to strike a balance between the performance characteristics of
mixtures with a high-RAP content.
