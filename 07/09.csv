densities through the metric formalism for extended mechanical charges. Ricci
scalar density is related to invariant sum of inertial and gravitational mass
densities of nonlocal matter-extension. Such a Cartesian continuum of
gravitating inertial densities is self-governed by internal tensor tensions
toward a static equilibrium state with a Euclidean material 3-space under the
equivalence of inertial and gravitational densities of extended masses.
External forces and local frictions transform the self-dynamics of an
elementary closed continuum into a forced motion of still adaptive energy
flows, where high-order space-time derivatives can provide non-Newtonian
self-accelerations. If such tensor inertial feedback with the inverse constant
of Cavendish 1/G is justified by measurements for the modified Navier-Stokes
equation, the Newton empty space model should be replaced by the Cartesian
matter-extension for the non-local macroscopic world.

colossal volumes of the Earth's atmosphere to detect extensive air showers
(EASs) produced by extremely energetic cosmic messengers: UHECRs above 20 EeV

study on the impact of POEMMA for UHECR science by simulating the detector
response and mission performance for EAS from UHECRs. We show that POEMMA will
provide a significant increase in the statistics of observed UHECRs at the
highest energies over the entire sky. POEMMA will be the first UHECR
fluorescence detector deployed in space that will provide high-quality
stereoscopic observations of the longitudinal development of air showers.
Therefore, it will be able to provide event-by-event estimates of the
calorimetric energy and nuclear mass of UHECRs. The particle physics in the
interactions limits the interpretation of the shower maximum on an event by
event basis. In contrast, the calorimetric energy measurement is significantly
less sensitive to the different possible final states in the early
interactions. We study the prospects to discover the origin and nature of
UHECRs using expectations for measurements of the energy spectrum, the
distribution of arrival direction, and the atmospheric column depth at which
the EAS longitudinal development reaches maximum. We also explore supplementary
science capabilities of POEMMA through its sensitivity to particle interactions
at extreme energies and its ability to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos and
photons produced by top-down models including cosmic strings and super-heavy

in terms of proliferation of certain atomic structures with a higher degree of
centrosymmetry, which are more rigid and possess less nonaffine softening

leads to the freezing-in of the dynamics beyond which further structural
rearrangements become highly unfavourable, thus explaining the kink in the

several consecutive frames to position the ball and can achieve high precision
even on public domain videos. The network is evaluated on the video of the

subject to error when written (transmitted) onto the media. In magnetic
recording systems with binary data and bipolar non-return-to-zero signaling,
patterns that have insufficient separation between consecutive transitions
exacerbate inter-symbol interference. Constrained codes are used to eliminate
such error-prone patterns. A recent example is a new family of
capacity-achieving constrained codes, named lexicographically-ordered
constrained codes (LOCO codes). LOCO codes are symmetric, that is, the set of
forbidden patterns is closed under taking pattern complements. LOCO codes are
suboptimal in terms of rate when used in Flash devices where block erasure is
employed since the complement of an error-prone pattern is not detrimental in
these devices. This paper introduces asymmetric LOCO codes (A-LOCO codes),
which are lexicographically-ordered constrained codes that forbid only those
patterns that are detrimental for Flash performance. A-LOCO codes are also
capacity-achieving, and at finite-lengths, they offer higher rates than the
available state-of-the-art constrained codes designed for the same goal. The
mapping-demapping between the index and the codeword in A-LOCO codes allows
low-complexity encoding and decoding algorithms that are simpler than their

increase in DMI strength and reduction in saturation magnetisation -- which are
a direct consequence of the effects of ion irradiation on the bottom and top
CoFeB interfaces, respectively. The threshold irradiation dose above which DWs
acquire a pure N\'eel character is experimentally found to be between 12

emerging as a benchmark in the field of multi-agent learning. In such games the

only critical points of the gradient dynamics are global Nash equilibria. We
then give sufficient conditions under which policy-gradient will avoid the Nash

converging to limit cycles for which the time average does not coincide with a

angular momentum (AM) transport between the core and the envelope is
inefficient, the large core AM upon core-collapse will produce rapidly rotating
neutron stars (NSs). However, observations of low-mass stars suggest an
efficient AM transport mechanism is at work, which could drastically reduce NS
spin rates. Here we study the effects of the baroclinic instability and the
magnetic Tayler instability in differentially rotating radiative zones.
Although the baroclinic instability may occur, the Tayler instability is likely
to be more effective for AM transport. We implement Tayler torques as
prescribed by Fuller et al. 2019 into models of massive stars, finding they
remove the vast majority of the core's AM as it contracts between the main
sequence and helium-burning phases of evolution. If core AM is conserved during
core-collapse, we predict natal NS rotation periods of $P_{\rm NS} \approx
50-200 \, {\rm ms}$, suggesting these torques help explain the relatively slow
rotation rates of most young NSs, and the rarity of rapidly rotating

transport within the star that determines its core rotation rate and the
resulting BH's spin. Internal rotation rates of low-mass stars measured from
asteroseismology prove that AM transport is efficient, suggesting that massive
stellar cores may rotate slower than prior expectations. We investigate AM
transport via the magnetic Tayler instability, which can largely explain the
rotation rates of low-mass stars and white dwarfs. Implementing an updated AM
transport prescription into models of high-mass stars, we compute the spins of
their BH remnants. We predict that BHs born from single stars rotate very
slowly, with $a \sim 10^{-2}$, regardless of initial rotation rate, possibly
explaining the low $\chi_{\rm eff}$ of most BH binaries detected by LIGO thus
far. A limited set of binary models suggests slow rotation for many binary
scenarios as well, although homogeneous evolution and tidal spin-up of
post-common envelope helium stars can create moderate or high BH spins. We make

  Artificial Intelligence and Applications (SAI 2019)",,,,"cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Auto dealerships receive thousands of calls daily from customers who are
interested in sales, service, vendors and jobseekers. With so many calls, it is
very important for auto dealers to understand the intent of these calls to
provide positive customer experiences that ensure customer satisfaction, deep
customer engagement to boost sales and revenue, and optimum allocation of
agents or customer service representatives across the business. In this paper,
we define the problem of customer phone call intent as a multi-class
classification problem stemming from the large database of recorded phone call
transcripts. To solve this problem, we develop a convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based supervised learning model to classify the customer calls into four
intent categories: sales, service, vendor and jobseeker. Experimental results
show that with the thrust of our scalable data labeling method to provide
sufficient training data, the CNN-based predictive model performs very well on
long text classification according to the quantitative metrics of F1-Score,
precision, recall, and accuracy.

population of low-luminosity FRIIs, extending three orders of magnitude below
the traditional FR break, and demonstrate that their host galaxies are on
average systematically fainter than those of high-luminosity FRIIs and of FRIs
matched in luminosity. This result supports the jet power/environment paradigm
for the FR break: low-power jets may remain undisrupted and form hotspots in
lower mass hosts. We also find substantial populations that appear physically
distinct from the traditional FR classes, including candidate restarting
sources and ``hybrids''. We identify 459 bent-tailed sources, which we find to
have a significantly higher SDSS cluster association fraction (at $z<0.4$) than

of classic blockchains by allowing a subset of participants to execute multiple
transactions outside the blockchain. While existing solutions like payment
networks and factories depend on a complex routing protocol, other solutions
simply require participants to build a \emph{childchain}, a secondary
blockchain where their transactions are privately executed. Unfortunately, all
childchain solutions assume either synchrony or a trusted execution
environment.
  In this paper, we present Platypus a childchain that requires neither
synchrony nor a trusted execution environment. Relieving the need for a trusted
execution environment allows Platypus to ensure privacy without trusting a
central authority, like Intel, that manufactures dedicated hardware chipset,
like SGX. Relieving the need for synchrony means that no attacker can steal
coins by leveraging clock drifts or message delays to lure timelocks.
  In order to prove our algorithm correct, we formalize the chilchain problem
as a Byzantine variant of the classic Atomic Commit problem, where closing a
childchain is equivalent to committing the whole set of payments previously
recorded on the childchain ``atomically'' on the main chain. Platypus is

Revised version",,"10.1093/mnras/staa315",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have shown that atmospheric mass-loss powered by the cooling
luminosity of a planet's core can explain the observed radius valley separating
super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, even without photoevaporation. In this work, we
investigate the dependence of this core-powered mass-loss mechanism on stellar
mass ($M_\ast$), metallicity ($Z_\ast$) and age ($\tau_\ast$). Without making
any changes to the underlying planet population, we find that the core-powered
mass-loss model yields a shift in the radius valley to larger planet sizes
around more massive stars with a slope given by $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d
log}M_\ast \simeq 0.35$, in agreement with observations. To first order, this
slope is driven by the dependence of core-powered mass-loss on the bolometric
luminosity of the host star and is given by $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}M_\ast
\simeq (3\alpha-2)/36 \simeq 0.33$, where $(L_\ast/L_\odot) =
(M_\ast/M_\odot)^\alpha$ is the stellar mass-luminosity relation and
$\alpha\simeq 4.6$ for the CKS dataset. We therefore find, in contrast to
photoevaporation models, no evidence for a linear correlation between planet
and stellar mass, but can't rule it out either. In addition, we show that the
location of the radius valley is, to first order, independent of stellar age
and metallicity. Since core-powered mass-loss proceeds over Gyr timescales, the
abundance of super-Earths relative to sub-Neptunes increases with age but
decreases with stellar metallicity. Finally, due the dependence of the
envelope's cooling timescale on metallicity, we find that the radii of
sub-Neptunes increase with metallicity and decrease with age with slopes given
by $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}Z_\ast \simeq 0.1$ and $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d

observational tests that can differentiate between core-powered mass-loss and
photoevaporation models.

spatial data that these applications generate and process, there is a pressing
need for scalable spatial query processing. In this paper, we present new
techniques for spatial query processing and optimization in an in-memory and
distributed setup to address scalability. More specifically, we introduce new
techniques for handling query skew, which is common in practice, and optimize
communication costs accordingly. We propose a distributed query scheduler that
use a new cost model to optimize the cost of spatial query processing. The
scheduler generates query execution plans that minimize the effect of query
skew. The query scheduler employs new spatial indexing techniques based on
bitmap filters to forward queries to the appropriate local nodes. Each local
computation node is responsible for optimizing and selecting its best local
query execution plan based on the indexes and the nature of the spatial queries
in that node. All the proposed spatial query processing and optimization
techniques are prototyped inside Spark, a distributed memory-based computation
system. The experimental study is based on real datasets and demonstrates that
distributed spatial query processing can be enhanced by up to an order of
magnitude over existing in-memory and distributed spatial systems.

Previous work processes 3D data using either voxel-based or point-based NN
models. However, both approaches are computationally inefficient. The
computation cost and memory footprints of the voxel-based models grow cubically
with the input resolution, making it memory-prohibitive to scale up the
resolution. As for point-based networks, up to 80% of the time is wasted on
structuring the sparse data which have rather poor memory locality, not on the
actual feature extraction. In this paper, we propose PVCNN that represents the
3D input data in points to reduce the memory consumption, while performing the
convolutions in voxels to reduce the irregular, sparse data access and improve
the locality. Our PVCNN model is both memory and computation efficient.
Evaluated on semantic and part segmentation datasets, it achieves much higher
accuracy than the voxel-based baseline with 10x GPU memory reduction; it also
outperforms the state-of-the-art point-based models with 7x measured speedup on
average. Remarkably, the narrower version of PVCNN achieves 2x speedup over
PointNet (an extremely efficient model) on part and scene segmentation
benchmarks with much higher accuracy. We validate the general effectiveness of
PVCNN on 3D object detection: by replacing the primitives in Frustrum PointNet
with PVConv, it outperforms Frustrum PointNet++ by 2.4% mAP on average with
1.5x measured speedup and GPU memory reduction.

natural correspondence between tensor networks and probabilistic graphical
models, we provide a rigorous analysis of the expressive power of various
tensor-network factorizations of discrete multivariate probability
distributions. These factorizations include non-negative tensor-trains/MPS,
which are in correspondence with hidden Markov models, and Born machines, which
are naturally related to local quantum circuits. When used to model probability
distributions, they exhibit tractable likelihoods and admit efficient learning
algorithms. Interestingly, we prove that there exist probability distributions
for which there are unbounded separations between the resource requirements of
some of these tensor-network factorizations. Particularly surprising is the
fact that using complex instead of real tensors can lead to an arbitrarily
large reduction in the number of parameters of the network. Additionally, we
introduce locally purified states (LPS), a new factorization inspired by
techniques for the simulation of quantum systems, with provably better
expressive power than all other representations considered. The ramifications
of this result are explored through numerical experiments. Our findings imply
that LPS should be considered over hidden Markov models, and furthermore

  18--20, 2020, San Francisco, CA, USA",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic taint analysis (DTA) is widely used by various applications to track
information flow during runtime execution. Existing DTA techniques use
rule-based taint-propagation, which is neither accurate (i.e., high false
positive) nor efficient (i.e., large runtime overhead). It is hard to specify
taint rules for each operation while covering all corner cases correctly.
Moreover, the overtaint and undertaint errors can accumulate during the
propagation of taint information across multiple operations. Finally,
rule-based propagation requires each operation to be inspected before applying
the appropriate rules resulting in prohibitive performance overhead on large
real-world applications.
  In this work, we propose NEUTAINT, a novel end-to-end approach to track
information flow using neural program embeddings. The neural program embeddings
model the target's programs computations taking place between taint sources and
sinks, which automatically learns the information flow by observing a diverse
set of execution traces. To perform lightweight and precise information flow
analysis, we utilize saliency maps to reason about most influential sources for
different sinks. NEUTAINT constructs two saliency maps, a popular machine
learning approach to influence analysis, to summarize both coarse-grained and
fine-grained information flow in the neural program embeddings.
  We compare NEUTAINT with 3 state-of-the-art dynamic taint analysis tools. The
evaluation results show that NEUTAINT can achieve 68% accuracy, on average,
which is 10% improvement while reducing 40 times runtime overhead over the
second-best taint tool Libdft on 6 real world programs. NEUTAINT also achieves
61% more edge coverage when used for taint-guided fuzzing indicating the
effectiveness of the identified influential bytes.

spatially coincident with two powerful [OIII]-emitting point sources with

binaries for many Hubble times, the so-called `final-parsec problem'.

the Local arm traced by high-mass star forming regions (HMSFRs), but its pitch

significance of the overdensity we report is marginal, its structure poses
questions concerning both of the competing scenarios of spiral arms, the
density-wave theory and the dynamic spiral arm model. The offset between the
arms traced by stars and HMSFRs, i.e., gas, is difficult to be explained by the
dynamic arm scenario. On the other hand, the pitch angle of the stellar Local

SNe) can explode inside a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that extends out to
many times the progenitor radius. This complicates the question of whether all
Ic-BL SNe harbor a jet, which can tunnel through the star and be viewed on-axis
as a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB). More specifically, a sufficiently
dense CSM might ""choke"" the jet, redistributing its energy quasi-spherically.
In this study, we numerically calculate the CSM density necessary for
jet-choking. For typical GRBs, we determine the jet is not choked in the CSM
unless $\rho r^2 > 4 \times 10^{19}$ g/cm; this requires several solar masses
of CSM to be situated within $10^{13}$ cm of the progenitor, a much higher
density than any CSM observed. We conclude that typical GRB jets are not choked
in the CSM. However, in many cases the CSM has sufficient mass to decelerate
the jet to a modest Lorentz factor ($\Gamma \sim 10$), which should lead to a
long coasting phase for the jet, observable as a long plateau (potentially up
to a few days) in the afterglow light curve. For extreme cases of low-energy
GRBs in a high-mass CSM, the jet will decelerate to nonrelativistic velocities,
causing it to spread modestly to a larger opening angle ($\theta_j \approx 20$
degrees) before breaking out of the CSM. Even in these extreme examples, the
jet does not have time to redistribute its energy quasi-spherically in the CSM
before breakout.

a merger-driven process as the most plausible scenario to explain the observed

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz3469",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interpretation of redshift surveys requires modeling the relationship
between large-scale fluctuations in the observed number density of tracers,
$\delta_\mathrm{h}$, and the underlying matter density, $\delta$. Bias models
often express $\delta_\mathrm{h}$ as a truncated series of integro-differential
operators acting on $\delta$, each weighted by a bias parameter. Due to the
presence of `composite operators' (obtained by multiplying fields evaluated at
the same spatial location), the linear bias parameter measured from clustering
statistics does not coincide with that appearing in the bias expansion. This
issue can be cured by re-writing the expansion in terms of `renormalised'
operators. After providing a pedagogical and comprehensive review of bias
renormalisation in perturbation theory, we generalize the concept to
non-perturbative dynamics and successfully apply it to dark-matter haloes
extracted from a large suite of N-body simulations. When comparing numerical
and perturbative results, we highlight the effect of the window function
employed to smooth the random fields. We then measure the bias parameters as a
function of halo mass by fitting a non-perturbative bias model (both before and
after applying renormalisation) to the cross spectrum
$P_{\delta_\mathrm{h}\delta}(k)$. Finally, we employ Bayesian model selection
to determine the optimal operator set to describe
$P_{\delta_\mathrm{h}\delta}(k)$ for $k<0.2\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at redshift $z=0$.
We find that it includes $\delta, \nabla^2\delta, \delta^2$ and the square of
the traceless tidal tensor, $s^2$. Considering higher-order terms (in $\delta$)
leads to overfitting as they cannot be precisely constrained by our data. We
also notice that next-to-leading-order perturbative solutions are inaccurate
for $k\gtrsim 0.1\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

distance measurements from parallax or water masers are screened but a
significant fraction of those in other galaxies are not, neglecting the
difference between their underlying period--luminosity relations biases the
local $H_0$ measurement high. This difference derives from a reduction in the
Cepheid pulsation period and possible increase in luminosity under a fifth
force. We quantify the internal and environmental gravitational properties of
the Riess et al. distance ladder galaxies to assess their degrees of screening
under a range of phenomenological models, and propagate this information into
the $H_0$ posterior as a function of fifth force strength. We consider
well-studied screening models in scalar--tensor gravity theories such as
chameleon, K-mouflage and Vainshtein, along with a recently-proposed mechanism

local dark matter density. We find that a fifth force strength $\sim5-30\%$

ladder data can constrain this strength. Although our analysis is exploratory

topological field theories which describe the dynamics of field singularities
using gauge fields. Homotopy groups are utilized to identify topologically
protected singularities, and the conservation of their protected number is
captured by a topological action term that unambiguously obtains from the given
set of symmetries. Stable phases of these theories include quantum liquids with
emergent massless Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields, as well as topological
orders with long-range quantum entanglement, fractional excitations, boundary

focuses on the derivation of topological field theories and basic
phenomenological characterization of topological orders associated with
homotopy groups $\pi_n(S^n)$, $n\ge 1$. These homotopies govern monopole and
hedgehog topological defects in $d=n+1$ dimensions, and enable the
generalization of both weakly-interacting and fractional quantum Hall liquids
of vortices to $d>2$. Hedgehogs have not been in the spotlight so far, but they
are particularly important defects of magnetic moments because they can be
stimulated in realistic systems with spin-orbit coupling, such as chiral
magnets and $d=3$ topological materials. We predict novel topological orders in
systems with U(1)$\times$Spin($d$) symmetry in which fractional electric charge
attaches to hedgehogs. Monopoles, the analogous defects of charge or generic
U(1) currents, may bind to hedgehogs via Zeeman effect, or effectively emerge
in purely magnetic systems. The latter can lead to spin liquids with different
topological orders than that of the RVB spin liquid. Charge fractionalization
of quarks in atomic nuclei is also seen as possibly arising from the
charge-hedgehog attachment.

minimizing the negative log likelihood (also known as cross entropy) of mixture
models. However, little is understood about the goodness of the fixed points it
converges to. In this paper, we study the regions where one component is
missing in two-component mixture models, which we call one-cluster regions. We
analyze the propensity of such regions to trap EM and gradient descent (GD) for
mixtures of two Gaussians and mixtures of two Bernoullis. In the case of
Gaussian mixtures, EM escapes one-cluster regions exponentially fast, while GD
escapes them linearly fast. In the case of mixtures of Bernoullis, we find that
there exist one-cluster regions that are stable for GD and therefore trap GD,
but those regions are unstable for EM, allowing EM to escape. Those regions are
local minima that appear universally in experiments and can be arbitrarily bad.
This work implies that EM is less likely than GD to converge to certain bad
local optima in mixture models.

gravitational perturbations due to the interaction, while the gas velocity
dispersion is simultaneously enhanced through shocks that convert kinematic

Angular momentum and rotation support in the disc are partly lost during the
most perturbing phases, resulting in a morphologically compact phase. The
fractions of present-day E/S0 versus later type galaxies can be predicted
within only a few per cent, confirming that roughly half of local discs were
reformed in the past 8-9 Gyr after gas-rich major mergers. Major mergers are
shown to strongly scatter scaling relations involving kinematic quantities
(e.g. the Tully-Fisher or Fall relations). Selecting high-z discs relying only
on $V/{\sigma}$ turns out to be less efficient than selecting discs from
multiple criteria based on their morpho-kinematic properties, which can reduce

galaxies frequently form extended radio haloes that are best observable in
edge-on galaxies. For the present study we selected two nearby edge-on galaxies
from the CHANG-ES survey, NGC 891 and 4565, which differ largely in halo size
and SFR. To figure out how such differences are related to the CRE transport in
disc and halo, we use wide-band 1.5 and 6 GHz VLA observations obtained in the
B, C, and D configurations, and combine the 6 GHz images with Effelsberg
observations to correct for missing short spacings. We study the spatially
resolved non-thermal spectral index distribution in terms of CRE spectral
ageing, compute total magnetic field strengths assuming energy equipartition
between CRs and magnetic fields, and also determine synchrotron scale heights.
Based on the vertical profiles of synchrotron intensity and spectral index, we
create purely advective and purely diffusive CRE transport models by
numerically solving the 1D diffusion-loss equation. In particular, we
investigate for the first time the radial dependence of synchrotron and
magnetic field scale heights, advection speeds and diffusion coefficients in
these two galaxies. We find the spectral index distribution of NGC 891 to be
mostly consistent with continuous CRE injection, while in NGC 4565 the local
synchrotron spectra are more in line with discrete-epoch CRE injection (JP or
KP models). This implies that CRE injection timescales are lower than the
synchrotron cooling timescales. The scale height of NGC 891 increases with
radius, indicating that synchrotron losses are significant. NGC 891 is probably
dominated by advective CRE transport at a velocity of
$\gtrsim150\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. In contrast, NGC 4565 is diffusion-dominated
up to $z=1$ kpc or higher, with a diffusion coefficient of
$\geq2\times10^{28}\,\mathrm{cm^2\,s^{-1}}$.

large stellar bar which is driving gas along prominent dust lanes to the inner
1 kpc where the gas settles into a circumnuclear ring. The ring is strongly
star forming and contains a substantial population of young stars as indicated
by the lowered stellar velocity dispersion and gas excitation consistent with
HII regions. We model the kinematics of the ring using the velocity field of
the CO (2--1) emission and stars and find it is consistent with a rotating
disk. The outer regions of the disk, where the dust lanes meet the ring, show
signatures of inflow at a rate of 1 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$. Inside the ring, we
observe three molecular gas components corresponding to the circular rotation
of the outer ring, a warped disk, and the nuclear stellar bar. The AGN is
driving an ionized gas outflow that reaches a radius of 250 pc with a mass
outflow rate of 0.08 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ consistent with its luminosity and
scaling relations from previous studies. While we observe distinct holes in CO

the AGN is not disrupting the structure of the circumnuclear region.

properties of galaxy clusters are tightly linked to structure formation, which
makes X-ray surveys well suited for cosmological studies. To constrain
cosmological parameters accurately by use of galaxy clusters in X-ray surveys,
a better understanding of selection effects related to the detection method is
needed. We aim at a better understanding of galaxy cluster morphologies to
include corrections between the different core types and covariances with X-ray
luminosities in selection functions. We stress the morphological deviations
between a newly described surface brightness (SB) profile characterization and
a commonly used single $\beta$-model. We investigate a novel approach to
describe SB profiles, where the excess cool-core emission in the galaxy cluster
centres is modelled using wavelet decomposition. Morphological parameters and
the residuals are compared to classical single $\beta$-models. Using single
$\beta$-models to describe the ensemble of overall SB profiles leads on average
to a non-zero bias ($0.032 \pm 0.003$) in the outer part of the clusters, i.e.
a $\sim 3\%$ systematic difference in the SB at large radii. In addition
$\beta$-models show a general trend towards underestimating the flux in the
outskirts for smaller core radii. Fixing the $\beta$ parameter to $2/3$ doubles
the bias and increases the residuals from a single $\beta$-model up to more
than $40\%$. Modelling the core region in the fitting procedure reduces the
impact of these two effects significantly. We find a positive scaling between
shape parameters and temperature, as well as a negative correlation
($\sim-0.4$) between extent and luminosity. Our non-parametric analysis of the
self-similar scaled emission measure profiles indicates no systematic core-type

surface can suspend a liquid droplet above a film of its own vapor. The
insulating vapor film can be highly detrimental in metallurgical quenching and
thermal control of electronic devices, but may also be harnessed to reduce drag
and generate power. Manipulation of the LFP has occurred mostly through
experiment, giving rise to a variety of semi-empirical models that account for
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, nucleation rates, and superheat limits.
However, a truly comprehensive model has been difficult given that the LFP
varies dramatically for different fluids and is affected by system pressure,
surface roughness and liquid wettability. Here, we identify the vapor film
instability for small length scales that ultimately sets the collapse condition
at the Leidenfrost point. From a linear stability analysis, it is shown that
the main film stabilizing mechanisms are the liquid-vapor surface tension,
viscous transport of vapor mass, and evaporation at the liquid-vapor interface.
Meanwhile, van der Waals interaction between the bulk liquid and the solid
substrate across the vapor phase drives film collapse. This physical insight
into vapor film dynamics allows us to derive an ab-initio, mathematical
expression for the Leidenfrost point of a fluid. The expression captures the
experimental data on the LFP for different fluids under various surface
wettabilities and ambient pressures. For fluids that wet the surface (small
intrinsic contact angle), the expression can be simplified to a single,
dimensionless number that encapsulates the thermo-wetting instability governing
the LFP.

among the most widely used approaches for solving a convex problem in

requires a fine tuning of system parameters according to the specific
application scenario, and which ultimately calls for a thorough understanding
of the hidden mechanisms that control the convergence behaviour. In this
framework we aim at providing new theoretical insights on the convergence
process and specifically on some constituent matrices of ADMM whose
eigenstructure provides a close link with the algorithm's convergence speed.
One of the key technique that we develop allows to effectively locate the
eigenvalues of a (symmetric) matrix product, thus being able to estimate the
contraction properties of ADMM. In the comparison with the results available
from the literature, we are able to strengthen the precision of our speed

Observation of the neutron spin resonance mode and our RPA calculations in

to the neutron spin resonance mode, upon decreasing temperature below the

in the low-energy inelastic channel. Single-crystal neutron diffraction
measurements demonstrate that the magnetic propagation vector of the Eu
sublattice is $\mathbf{k}=(0, 0, 0.25)$, representing the three-dimensional
antiferromagnetic order. Linear spin wave calculations assuming the obtained
magnetic structure with the intra- and inter-plane nearest neighbor exchange
couplings of $J_1/k_\text{B}=-1.31$~K and $J_c/k_\text{B}=0.08$~K can reproduce

is still the subject of debate. Here we present and analyze disk structures
around ten multiple stellar systems that were included in an unbiased, high
spatial resolution survey performed with ALMA of 32 protoplanetary disks in the
Taurus star-forming region. At the unprecedented spatial resolution of ~0.12""
we detect and spatially resolve the disks around all primary stars, and those
around eight secondary and one tertiary star. The dust radii of disks around
multiple stellar systems are smaller than those around single stars in the same
stellar mass range and in the same region. The disks in multiple stellar
systems also show a steeper decay of the millimeter continuum emission at the
outer radius than disks around single stars, suggestive of the impact of tidal
truncation on the shape of the disks in multiple systems. However, the observed
ratio between the dust disk radii and the observed separation of the stars in
the multiple systems is consistent with analytic predictions of the effect of
tidal truncation only if the eccentricities of the binaries are rather high
(typically >0.5), or if the observed dust radii are a factor of two smaller
than the gas radii, as is typical for isolated systems. Similar high-resolution
studies targeting the gaseous emission from disks in multiple stellar systems
are required to resolve this question.

  Complexity Theory","41 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CC cs.DM cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Counting homomorphisms from a graph $H$ into another graph $G$ is a
fundamental problem of (parameterized) counting complexity theory. In this
work, we study the case where \emph{both} graphs $H$ and $G$ stem from given
classes of graphs: $H\in \mathcal{H}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$. By this, we
combine the structurally restricted version of this problem, with the
language-restricted version.
  Our main result is a construction based on Kneser graphs that associates
every problem $\tt P$ in $\#\mathsf{W[1]}$ with two classes of graphs
$\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ such that the problem $\tt P$ is
\emph{equivalent} to the problem $\#{\tt HOM}(\mathcal{H}\to \mathcal{G})$ of
counting homomorphisms from a graph in $\mathcal{H}$ to a graph in
$\mathcal{G}$. In view of Ladner's seminal work on the existence of
$\mathsf{NP}$-intermediate problems [J.ACM'75] and its adaptations to the
parameterized setting, a classification of the class $\#\mathsf{W[1]}$ in
fixed-parameter tractable and $\#\mathsf{W[1]}$-complete cases is unlikely.
Hence, obtaining a complete classification for the problem $\#{\tt
HOM}(\mathcal{H}\to \mathcal{G})$ seems unlikely. Further, our proofs easily
adapt to $\mathsf{W[1]}$.
  In search of complexity dichotomies, we hence turn to special graph classes.
Those classes include line graphs, claw-free graphs, perfect graphs, and
combinations thereof, and $F$-colorable graphs for fixed graphs $F$: If the
class $\mathcal{G}$ is one of those classes and the class $\mathcal{H}$ is
closed under taking minors, then we establish explicit criteria for the class
$\mathcal{H}$ that partition the family of problems $\#{\tt
HOM}(\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{G})$ into polynomial-time solvable and
$\#\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard cases. In particular, we can drop the condition of
$\mathcal{H}$ being minor-closed for $F$-colorable graphs.

displacement will be vital to a wide range of industrial, environmental, and
pharmaceutical applications, such as geological carbon-dioxide sequestration,
enhanced oil recovery, and drug delivery. We restrict our study to VF, a
well-known hydrodynamic instability, in miscible fluid systems but consider
double-diffusive (DD) effects---the combined effect of compositional changes
because of solute transport and temperature. One often uses numerical
formulations to study VF with DD effects. The primary aim of the current study
is to show that popular formulations have limitations to study VF with DD
effect. These limitations include exhibiting node-to-node spurious
oscillations, violating physical constraints such as the non-negativity of the
concentration field or mathematical principles such as the maximum principle,
and suppressing physical instabilities. We will use several popular stabilized
finite element formulations---the SUPG formulations and three modifications
based on the SOLD approach---in our study. Using representative numerical
results, we will illustrate two critical limitations. First, we document that
these formulations do not respect the non-negative constraint and the maximum
principle for the concentration field. We will also show the impact of these
violations on how viscous fingers develop. Second, we show that these
stabilized formulations, often used to suppress numerical instabilities, may
also suppress physical instabilities, such as viscous fingering. Our study will
be valuable to practitioners who use existing numerical formulations and to
computational mathematicians who develop new formulations.

formation is related to the n-body problem. Here we present the novel n-body
dynamical transport approach PHQMD (Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics)
which is designed to provide a microscopic description of nuclear cluster and
hypernucleus formation as well as of general particle production in heavy-ion
reactions at relativistic energies. In difference to the coalescence or
statistical models, often used for the cluster formation, in PHQMD clusters are
formed dynamically due to the interactions between baryons described on a basis
of Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD)which allows to propagate the n-body Wigner
density and n-body correlations in phase-space, essential for the cluster
formation. The clusters are identified by the MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) or
the SACA ('Simulated Annealing Cluster Algorithm') algorithm which finds the
most bound configuration of nucleons and clusters. Collisions among hadrons as
well as Quark-Gluon-Plasma formation and parton dynamics in PHQMD are treated
in the same way as in the established PHSD (Parton-Hadron-String
Dynamics)transport approach. In order to verify our approach with respect to
the general dynamics we present here the first PHQMD results for general 'bulk'
observables such as rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra for
hadrons ($\pi, K, \bar K, p, \bar p, \Lambda, \bar \Lambda$) from SIS to RHIC
energies. We find a good description of the 'bulk' dynamics which allows us to
proceed with the results on cluster production, including hypernuclei.

infinite range. Consequently, these equations lack a natural phase space, so
that classic dynamical systems tools are not at our disposal. We therefore
develop, from scratch, a general transversality theory, and a classification of

topological Hopf invariant, are widely investigated in the diverse areas

magneto- and hydrodynamics and condensed matter physics. Yet, while holding
high promise for applications, they remain elusive and under-explored. Here we
demonstrate that Hopfions emerge as a basic configuration of polarization field

  Contracts",,,,,"cs.CR cs.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ethereum smart contracts are executable programs, deployed on a peer-to-peer
network and executed in a consensus-based fashion. Their bytecode is public,
immutable and once deployed to the blockchain, cannot be patched anymore. As
smart contracts may hold Ether worth of several million dollars, they are
attractive targets for attackers and indeed some contracts have successfully
been exploited in the recent past, resulting in tremendous financial losses.
The correctness of smart contracts is thus of utmost importance. While first
approaches on formal verification exist, they demand users to be well-versed in
formal methods which are alien to many developers and are only able to analyze
individual contracts, without considering their execution environment, i.e.,
calls to external contracts, sequences of transaction, and values from the
actual blockchain storage. In this paper, we present Annotary, a concolic
execution framework to analyze smart contracts for vulnerabilities, supported
by annotations which developers write directly in the Solidity source code. In
contrast to existing work, Annotary supports analysis of inter-transactional,
inter-contract control flows and combines symbolic execution of EVM bytecode
with a resolution of concrete values from the public Ethereum blockchain. While
the analysis of Annotary tends to weight precision higher than soundness, we
analyze inter-transactional call chains to eliminate false positives from
unreachable states that traditional symbolic execution would not be able to
handle. We present the annotation and analysis concepts of Annotary, explain
its implementation on top of the Laser symbolic virtual machine, and
demonstrate its usage as a plugin for the Sublime Text editor.

with the Hubble Space Telescope during the 6-month reverberation-mapping
campaign in 2014. Our model of the emission from NGC 5548 corrects for
overlying absorption and deblends the individual emission lines. Using the
modeled spectra, we measure the response to continuum variations for the
deblended and absorption-corrected individual broad emission lines, the
velocity-dependent profiles of Ly$\alpha$ and C IV, and the narrow and broad
intrinsic absorption features. We find that the time lags for the corrected
emission lines are comparable to those for the original data. The
velocity-binned lag profiles of Ly$\alpha$ and C IV have a double-peaked
structure indicative of a truncated Keplerian disk. The narrow absorption lines
show delayed response to continuum variations corresponding to recombination in
gas with a density of $\sim 10^5~\rm cm^{-3}$. The high-ionization narrow
absorption lines decorrelate from continuum variations during the same period
as the broad emission lines. Analyzing the response of these absorption lines
during this period shows that the ionizing flux is diminished in strength
relative to the far-ultraviolet continuum. The broad absorption lines
associated with the X-ray obscurer decrease in strength during this same time
interval. The appearance of X-ray obscuration in $\sim\,2012$ corresponds with
an increase in the luminosity of NGC 5548 following an extended low state. We
suggest that the obscurer is a disk wind triggered by the brightening of NGC
5548 following the decrease in size of the broad-line region during the
preceding low-luminosity state.

action and planning as a bayesian inference problem to be solved by minimizing

unifying account of action and perception coupled with a biologically plausible
process theory. Despite these potential advantages, current implementations of
Active Inference can only handle small, discrete policy and state-spaces and
typically require the environmental dynamics to be known. In this paper we
propose a novel deep Active Inference algorithm which approximates key

enables Active Inference to scale to significantly larger and more complex
tasks. We demonstrate our approach on a suite of OpenAIGym benchmark tasks and
obtain performance comparable with common reinforcement learning baselines.
Moreover, our algorithm shows similarities with maximum entropy reinforcement

magnetic recording (HAMR) on granular media depends on a large number of
different parameters. The choice of material properties is essential for the
obtained switching probabilities of single grains and therefore for the written
bits' quality in terms of SNR. Studies where the effects of different material
compositions on transition jitter and the switching probability are evaluated
were done, but it is not obvious, how significant those improvements will
finally change the received SNR. To investigate that influence, we developed an
analytical model of the switching probability phase diagram, which contains
independent parameters for, inter alia, transition width, switching probability
and curvature. Different values lead to corresponding bit patterns on granular
media, where a reader model detects the resulting signal, which is finally
converted to a parameter dependent SNR value. For grain diameters between 4 and
8nm, we show an increase of ~10dB for bit lengths between 4 and 12nm, an
increase of ~9dB for maximum switching probabilities between 0.64 and 1.00, a
decrease of ~5dB for down-track-jitter parameters between 0 and 4nm and an
increase of ~1dB for reduced bit curvature. Those results are furthermore
compared to the theoretical formulas for the SNR. We obtain a good agreement,

employ a block-coordinate primal-dual scheme in which randomly selected primal

component functions in the finite sum is massive, we can derive further
efficiency by utilizing an increasing batch-size of gradients, leading to
progressive variance reduction. An ergodic convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\log(K)/K)$ is obtained using variance reduction which is the
first known rate result for a special purpose method to deal with finite-sum
non-bilinear saddle point problems, matching the best-known rate (up to a log
factor) associated with deterministic primal-dual schemes using full gradients.
Using an acceleration for the setting where a single component gradient is
utilized, a non-asymptotic rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log(K)/\sqrt{K})$ is obtained.
Finally, for both single and increasing sample size scenarios, almost sure

decreases with local density at $z=0.0$, but its dependence on local density
becomes weaker with redshift. At $z\gtrsim1.0$, the SFR of galaxies increases
with local density (reversal of the SFR-density relation), and its dependence
becomes stronger with redshift. This change of SFR-density relation with
redshift still remains even when fixing the stellar masses of galaxies. The
dependence of SFR on the distance to a galaxy cluster also shows a change with
redshift in a way similar to the case based on local density, but the reversal
happens at a higher redshift, $z\sim1.5$, in clusters. On the other hand, the
molecular gas fraction always decreases with local density regardless of
redshift at $z=0.0-2.0$ even though the dependence becomes weaker when we fix
the stellar mass. Our study demonstrates that the observed reversal of the
SFR-density relation at $z\gtrsim1.0$ can be successfully reproduced in
cosmological simulations. Our results are consistent with the idea that
massive, star-forming galaxies are strongly clustered at high redshifts,
forming larger structures. These galaxies then consume their gas faster than
those in low-density regions through frequent interactions with other galaxies,
ending up being quiescent in the local universe.

type of Leonard pair, said to have spin. The notion of a spin model was
introduced by V.F.R. Jones to construct link invariants. A spin model is a
symmetric matrix over $\mathbb{C}$ that satisfies two conditions, called the
type II and type III conditions. It is known that a spin model $\sf W$ is
contained in a certain finite-dimensional algebra $N({\sf W})$, called the
Nomura algebra. It often happens that a spin model $\sf W$ satisfies ${\sf W}
\in {\sf M} \subseteq N({\sf W})$, where $\sf M$ is the Bose-Mesner algebra of
a distance-regular graph $\Gamma$; in this case we say that $\Gamma$ affords
$\sf W$. If $\Gamma$ affords a spin model, then each irreducible module for
every Terwilliger algebra of $\Gamma$ takes a certain form, recently described
by Caughman, Curtin, Nomura, and Wolff. In the present paper we show that the
converse is true; if each irreducible module for every Terwilliger algebra of

we derive from first principles a measure known as effective information and
describe its behavior in common network models. Networks with higher effective

show how subgraphs of nodes can be grouped into macro-nodes, reducing the size

causal emergence). We find that informative higher scales are common in

only structures which contribute to the free energy are chains. We then argue
that the dominance of chain structures is equivalent to the dominance of chain
diagrams in a cluster expansion, but only if the expansion is performed around
a hard sphere system (rather than the standard ideal gas). We show that this
leads to non-standard factorization rules for diagrams, and use this to
construct a closed-form expression for the free energy at low densities. We
then compare this construction to several models previously developed for the
hard sphere dipole system in the regime where chain structures dominate, and
argue that the comparison provides evidence in favor of one model over the

devices, each with its own dataset, carry out distributed stochastic gradient
descent (DSGD) over-the-air with the help of a wireless access point acting as

devices compute gradient estimates with their local datasets, and send them to
the PS over a wireless fading multiple access channel (MAC). Motivated by the
additive nature of the wireless MAC, we propose an analog DSGD scheme, in which
the devices transmit scaled versions of their gradient estimates in an uncoded

at the PS. We instead allow the PS to employ multiple antennas to alleviate the
destructive fading effect, which cannot be cancelled by the transmitters due to
the lack of CSI. Theoretical analysis indicates that, with the proposed DSGD
scheme, increasing the number of PS antennas mitigates the fading effect, and,
in the limit, the effects of fading and noise disappear, and the PS receives
aligned signals used to update the model parameter. The theoretical results are
then corroborated with the experimental ones.

Multiple-time Elliptic Curve Signature (SEMECS), which is suitable for

private key sizes for an EC-based signature without requiring any EC operation

difficult instrumental challenge. Present coronagraphic systems have yet to
achieve the required $10^{-10}$ broadband contrast in a laboratory environment,
but promising progress towards this goal continues. A new approach to starlight
suppression is the use of a single-mode fiber behind a coronagraph. By using
deformable mirrors to create a mismatch between incoming starlight and the
fiber mode, a single-mode fiber can be turned into an integral part of the
starlight suppression system. In this paper, we present simulation results of a
system with five single-mode fibers coupled to shaped pupil and vortex
coronagraphs. We investigate the properties of the system, including its
spectral bandwidth, throughput, and sensitivity to low-order aberrations. We
also compare the performance of the single-mode fiber configuration with
conventional imaging and multi-object modes, finding improved spectral
bandwidth, raw contrast, background-limited SNR, and demonstrate a wavefront
control algorithm which is robust to tip/tilt errors.

NeurIPS 2019 Camera-ready version",,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent results in the literature indicate that a residual network (ResNet)
composed of a single residual block outperforms linear predictors, in the sense
that all local minima in its optimization landscape are at least as good as the
best linear predictor. However, these results are limited to a single residual
block (i.e., shallow ResNets), instead of the deep ResNets composed of multiple
residual blocks. We take a step towards extending this result to deep ResNets.
We start by two motivating examples. First, we show that there exist datasets
for which all local minima of a fully-connected ReLU network are no better than
the best linear predictor, whereas a ResNet has strictly better local minima.
Second, we show that even at the global minimum, the representation obtained
from the residual block outputs of a 2-block ResNet do not necessarily improve
monotonically over subsequent blocks, which highlights a fundamental difficulty
in analyzing deep ResNets. Our main theorem on deep ResNets shows under simple
geometric conditions that, any critical point in the optimization landscape is
either (i) at least as good as the best linear predictor; or (ii) the Hessian
at this critical point has a strictly negative eigenvalue. Notably, our theorem
shows that a chain of multiple skip-connections can improve the optimization
landscape, whereas existing results study direct skip-connections to the last
hidden layer or output layer. Finally, we complement our results by showing
benign properties of the ""near-identity regions"" of deep ResNets, showing
depth-independent upper bounds for the risk attained at critical points as well
as the Rademacher complexity.

Lecoanet et al. (2016) are used, along with an explicit Navier-Stokes viscosity
and thermal conductivity to enforce the evolution in the non-linear regime. We
demonstrate convergence to the reference solution using SPH. The evolution of
the vortex structures and the degree of mixing, as measured by a passive scalar
`colour' field, match the reference solution. Tests with an initial density
contrast produce the correct qualitative behaviour. The L2 error of the SPH
calculations decreases as the resolution is increased. The primary source of
error is numerical dissipation arising from artificial viscosity, and tests
with reduced artificial viscosity have reduced L2 error. A high-order smoothing
kernel is needed in order to resolve the initial velocity amplitude of the
seeded mode and inhibit excitation of spurious modes. We find that standard SPH
with an artificial viscosity has no difficulty in correctly modelling the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and yields convergent solutions.

a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based detector to effectively detect the
data symbols stored in the multi-level-cell (MLC) flash memory without any
prior knowledge of the channel. However, compared with the conventional
threshold detector, the proposed RNN detector introduces much longer read
latency and more power consumption. To tackle this problem, we further propose
an RNN-aided (RNNA) dynamic threshold detector, whose detection thresholds can
be derived based on the outputs of the RNN detector. We thus only need to
activate the RNN detector periodically when the system is idle. Moreover, to
enable soft-decision decoding of error-correction codes, we first show how to
obtain more read thresholds based on the hard-decision read thresholds derived
from the RNN detector. We then propose integer-based reliability mappings based
on the designed read thresholds, which can generate the soft information of the
channel. Finally, we propose to apply density evolution (DE) combined with
differential evolution algorithm to optimize the read thresholds for LDPC coded
flash memory channels. Computer simulation results demonstrate the

gap, however, still exists in understanding ion transport mechanisms and
improving ion transport in solid polymer electrolytes. Therefore, it is crucial
to bridge composition--structure and structure--property relationships. Here we
demonstrate that size asymmetry, $\lambda$, represented by the ratio of
counterion to charged monomer size, plays a key role in both the nanostructure
and in the ionic dynamics. More specifically, when the nanostructure is
modified by the external electric field such that the mobility cannot be
described by linear response theory, two situations arise. The ionic mobility
increases as $\lambda$ decreases (small counterions) in the weak electrostatics
(high dielectric constant) regime. Whereas in systems with strong electrostatic
interactions, ionomers with higher size symmetry ($\lambda \approx 1$) display
higher ionic mobility. Moreover, ion transport is found to be dominated by the
hopping of the ions and not by moving ionic clusters (also known as
""vehicular'' charge transport). These results serve as a guide for designing
ion-containing polymers for ion transport related applications.

near-infrared multiband polarimetry. A close approach of the comet to the Earth
in March 2016 (~0.036 au) provided a rare opportunity for the sampling of the
comet with a high spatial resolution. Methods. We made NIR JHKS bands
polarimetric observations of the comet for 12 days near perihelion,
interspersed between broadband optical imaging observations over four months.
In addition, dynamical simulation of the comet was performed 1000 yr backward
in time. Results. We detected two discontinuous brightness enhancements. Before
the first enhancement, the NIR polarization degrees were far lower than those
of ordinary comets at a given phase angle. Soon after the activation, however,
they increased by ~13 % at most, showing unusual blue polarimetric color over
the J and H bands (-2.55 % / um on average) and bluing of both J-H and H-Ks
dust color. Throughout the event, the polarization vector was marginally
aligned perpendicular to the scattering plane. The subsequent postperihelion
reactivation of the comet lasted for approximately 1.5 months, with a factor of
~30 times pre-activation dust mass-loss rates in the Rc band. Conclusions. The
marked increase in the polarization degree with blue NIR polarimetric color is
reminiscent of the behaviors of a fragmenting comet D/1999 S4 (LINEAR). The
most plausible scenario for the observed polarimetric properties of 252P/LINEAR
would be an ejection of predominantly large, compact dust particles from the
desiccated surface layer. We conjecture that the more intense solar heating
that the comet has received in the near-Earth orbit would cause the paucity of
small, fluffy dust particles around the nucleus of the comet.

and accurate outdoor visual localization in long-term scenarios. Given a query
image, we first match it against a database of registered reference images,
using recent retrieval techniques. This gives us a first estimate of the camera
pose. To refine this estimate, like previous approaches, we match 2D points
across the query image and the retrieved reference image. This step, however,
is prone to fail as it is still very difficult to detect and match sparse
feature points across images captured in potentially very different conditions.
Our key contribution is to show that we need to extract sparse feature points
only in the retrieved reference image: We then search for the corresponding 2D
locations in the query image exhaustively. This search can be performed
efficiently using convolutional operations, and robustly by using hypercolumn
descriptors, i.e. image features computed for retrieval. We refer to this
method as Sparse-to-Dense Hypercolumn Matching. Because we know the 3D
locations of the sparse feature points in the reference images thanks to an
offline reconstruction stage, it is then possible to accurately estimate the
camera pose from these matches. Our experiments show that this method allows us
to outperform the state-of-the-art on several challenging outdoor datasets.

  Motion with Sparse Articulated Motion",,,,,"cs.CV cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we address the problem of exact recovery condition in
retrieving 3D human motion from 2D landmark motion. We use a skeletal kinematic
model to represent the 3D human motion as a vector of angular articulation
motion. We address this problem based on the observation that at high tracking
rate, regardless of the global rigid motion, only few angular articulations
have non-zero motion. We propose a first ideal formulation with $\ell_0$-norm
to minimize the cardinal of non-zero angular articulation motion given an
equality constraint on the time-differentiation of the reprojection error. The
second relaxed formulation relies on an $\ell_1$-norm to minimize the sum of
absolute values of the angular articulation motion. This formulation has the
advantage of being able to provide 3D motion even in the under-determined case
when twice the number of 2D landmarks is smaller than the number of angular
articulations. We define a specific property which is the Projective Kinematic
Space Property (PKSP) that takes into account the reprojection constraint and
the kinematic model. We prove that for the relaxed formulation we are able to
recover the exact 3D human motion from 2D landmarks if and only if the PKSP
property is verified. We further demonstrate that solving the relaxed
formulation provides the same ground-truth solution as the ideal formulation if
and only if the PKSP condition is filled. Results with simulated sparse
skeletal angular motion show the ability of the proposed method to recover
exact location of angular motion. We provide results on publicly available real
data (HUMAN3.6M, PANOPTIC and MPI-I3DHP).

interactions, i.e., resulting from electrical charges associated with the
atoms, and covalent ones, i.e., the sharing of electrons between nuclei of
different atoms, are usually viewed as forces that attract between atoms to
form a rigid structure. Although less common for solid materials, it was shown
theoretically to be possible for covalent interactions at the chemically-active
electronic shell (or valence-band maximum) of semiconductors to reverse their
more common nature and become repulsive, i.e., act against bonding. Some
semiconductors with such predicted anti-bonding valence-band maximum levels
(such as halide perovskites) show experimentally some amazing (opto-)
electronic properties. Predictions that anti-bonding character can allow
tolerance for existing defects, at least in part, can explain the superior
properties of such semiconductors. Although there are known experimental ways
to estimate the degree of the covalent nature (e.g., electronegativity), this
was not possible hitherto for the type, i.e., distinguishing whether a material
exhibits bonding or anti-bonding covalent interactions. We have developed a
simple way to reveal the complete nature (both type and degree) of chemical
bonds, using experimental data. After confirming our development with classical

imitation learning and provide theoretical results showing why preferences over

inverse reinforcement learning. Building on this theory, we introduce
Disturbance-based Reward Extrapolation (D-REX), a ranking-based imitation
learning method that injects noise into a policy learned through behavioral
cloning to automatically generate ranked demonstrations. These ranked
demonstrations are used to efficiently learn a reward function that can then be
optimized using reinforcement learning. We empirically validate our approach on
simulated robot and Atari imitation learning benchmarks and show that D-REX
outperforms standard imitation learning approaches and can significantly
surpass the performance of the demonstrator. D-REX is the first imitation
learning approach to achieve significant extrapolation beyond the
demonstrator's performance without additional side-information or supervision,
such as rewards or human preferences. By generating rankings automatically, we
show that preference-based inverse reinforcement learning can be applied in
traditional imitation learning settings where only unlabeled demonstrations are

promising class of spintronics materials. The peculiar coupling between spin
and polar degrees of freedom responsible for several exceptional properties,
including ferroelectric switching of Rashba spin texture, suggests that the
electron's spin could be controlled by using only electric fields. In this
regard, recent experimental studies revealing charge-to-spin interconversion
phenomena in two prototypical FERSC, GeTe and SnTe, appear extremely relevant.
Here, by employing density functional theory calculations, we investigate spin
Hall effect (SHE) in these materials and show that it can be large either in
ferroelectric or paraelectric structure. We further explore the compatibility
between doping required for the practical realization of SHE in semiconductors
and polar distortions which determine Rashba-related phenomena in FERSC, but
which could be suppressed by free charge carriers. Based on the analysis of the
lone pairs which drive ferroelectricity in these materials, we have found that
the polar displacements in GeTe can be sustained up to a critical hole
concentration of over $\sim 10^{21}$/cm$^{3}$, while the tiny distortions in
SnTe vanish at a minimal level of doping. Finally, we have estimated spin Hall
angles for doped structures and demonstrated that the spin Hall effect could be
indeed achieved in a polar phase. We believe that the confirmation of spin Hall
effect, Rashba spin textures and ferroelectricity coexisting in one material
will be helpful for design of novel multifunctional spintronics devices
operating without magnetic fields.

Additionally, we utilise a tabulated equation of state including the envelope
recombination energy in the simulation (Reichardt et al.), achieving a full

Simulation is an efficient way in the development and testing of complex

due to the lack of credible simulation platforms and assessment methods. This
paper proposes a credible simulation platform based on real-time FPGA-based
hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation, and then an assessment method is
proposed to quantitatively assess its simulation credibility. By using the FPGA
to simulate all sensor chips, the simulation platform can ensure that the
tested electronic system maintains the same hardware and software operating
environment in both simulations and experiments, which makes it possible to
perform the same tests in the simulation platform and the real experiment to
compare and analyze the simulation errors. Then, the testing methods and
assessment indices are proposed to assess the simulation platform from various
perspectives, such as performance, time-domain response, and frequency-domain
response. These indices are all normalized to the same scale (from 0 to 1) and
mapped to a uniform assessment criterion, which makes it convenient to compare
and synthesize different assessment indices. Finally, an overall assessment
index is proposed by combining all assessment indices obtained from different
tests to assess the simulation credibility of the whole simulation platform.
The simulation platform and the proposed assessment method are applied to a

state information retrieved from commodity WiFi devices for respiration
monitoring. However, existing approaches only work when the target is close to
the WiFi transceivers and the performance degrades significantly when the
target is far away. On the other hand, most home environments only have one
WiFi access point and it may not be located in the same room as the target.
This sensing range constraint greatly limits the application of the proposed
approaches in real life.
  This paper presents FarSense--the first real-time system that can reliably
monitor human respiration when the target is far away from the WiFi transceiver
pair. FarSense works well even when one of the transceivers is located in
another room, moving a big step towards real-life deployment. We propose two
novel schemes to achieve this goal: (1) Instead of applying the raw CSI
readings of individual antenna for sensing, we employ the ratio of CSI readings
from two antennas, whose noise is mostly canceled out by the division operation
to significantly increase the sensing range; (2) The division operation further
enables us to utilize the phase information which is not usable with one single
antenna for sensing. The orthogonal amplitude and phase are elaborately
combined to address the ""blind spots"" issue and further increase the sensing
range. Extensive experiments show that FarSense is able to accurately monitor
human respiration even when the target is 8 meters away from the transceiver
pair, increasing the sensing range by more than 100%. We believe this is the
first system to enable through-wall respiration sensing with commodity WiFi
devices and the proposed method could also benefit other sensing applications.

donations over time, in addition to its relationship to the age and popularity
of a repository.
  We scanned over three million repositories looking for donation addresses. We
then extracted and analyzed their transactions from Bitcoin's public
blockchain. Overall, we found a limited adoption of Bitcoin as a payment method
for receiving donations, with nearly 44 thousand deposits adding up to only 8.3
million dollars in the last 10 years. We also found weak positive correlation
between the amount of donations in dollars and the popularity of a repository,
with highest correlation (r=0.013) associated with number of forks.

systems, owing to the recent advancements in standardising various aspects such
as architecture, optimization techniques, and regularization. In this paper, we
take a step towards a better understanding of Spectral Normalization (SN) and
its potential for standardizing regularization of a wider range of Deep
Learning models, following an empirical approach. We conduct several
experiments to study their training dynamics, in comparison with the ubiquitous
Batch Normalization (BN) and show that SN increases the gradient sparsity and
controls the gradient variance. Furthermore, we show that SN suffers from a
phenomenon, we call the mean-drift effect, which mitigates its performance. We,
then, propose a weight reparameterization called as the Mean Spectral
Normalization (MSN) to resolve the mean drift, thereby significantly improving
the network's performance. Our model performs ~16% faster as compared to BN in
practice, and has fewer trainable parameters. We also show the performance of
our MSN for small, medium, and large CNNs - 3-layer CNN, VGG7 and DenseNet-BC,
respectively - and unsupervised image generation tasks using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to evaluate its applicability for a broad range of

recent incremental interventions (which shift propensity scores rather than set
treatment values deterministically) to accommodate multiple outcomes and
subject dropout. We give an identifying expression for incremental intervention
effects when dropout is conditionally ignorable (without requiring treatment
positivity), and derive the nonparametric efficiency bound for estimating such
effects. Then we present efficient nonparametric estimators, showing that they
converge at fast parametric rates and yield uniform inferential guarantees,
even when nuisance functions are estimated flexibly at slower rates. We also
study the variance ratio of incremental intervention effects relative to more
conventional deterministic effects in a novel infinite time horizon setting,
where the number of timepoints can grow with sample size, and show that
incremental intervention effects yield near-exponential gains in statistical
precision in this setup. Finally we conclude with simulations and apply our

a block to become shared variables of its component parallel processes. To
support the mechanisation of the rely/guarantee approach, we have developed a
synchronous concurrent refinement algebra. Its foundation consists of a small

investigated for different element heights and spacings using DNS. The flow can
be decomposed into the element-coherent, dispersive flow, the
Kelvin--Helmholtz-like rollers typically reported over dense canopies, and the
background, incoherent turbulence. The canopies studied have spacings $s^+ =
3$--$50$, which essentially preclude the background turbulence from penetrating
within. The dispersive velocity fluctuations are also mainly determined by the
spacing, and are small deep within the canopy, where the footprint of the
Kelvin--Helmholtz-like rollers dominates. Their typical streamwise wavelength
is determined by the mixing length, which is essentially the sum of its height
above and below the canopy tips. For the present dense canopies, the former
remains roughly the same in wall-units, and the latter, which scales with the
drag length, depends linearly on the spacing. This is the result of the drag
being essentially viscous and governed by the planar layout of the canopy. In
shallow canopies, the proximity of the canopy floor inhibits the formation of
Kelvin--Helmholtz-like rollers, with essentially no signature for
height-to-spacing ratios $h/s \approx 1$, and no further inhibition beyond $h/s
\approx 6$. Very small spacings also inhibit the rollers, due to their
obstruction by the canopy elements. The obstruction decreases with increasing
spacing and the signature of the instability intensifies, even if for canopies
sparser than those studied here the instability eventually breaks down. Simple
models based on linear stability can capture some of the above effects.

are actually being used for. We use DNS cache snooping to determine what
domains people are accessing through VPNs. This technique is used to discover
whether certain queries have been made against a particular DNS server. Some
VPNs operate their own DNS servers, ensuring that any cached queries were made
by users of the VPN. We explore 3 methods of DNS cache snooping and briefly
discuss their strengths and limitations. Using the most reliable of the
methods, we perform a DNS cache snooping scan against the DNS servers of
several major VPN providers. With this we discover which domains are actually
accessed through VPNs. We run this technique against popular domains, as well
as those known to be censored in certain countries; China, Indonesia, Iran, and
Turkey. Our work gives a glimpse into what users use VPNs for, and provides a

digital image forensics, enabling the unique linkage of images to digital
cameras. This so-called camera fingerprint gives rise to different
applications, such as image forensics and authentication. However, if images
are publicly available, an adversary can estimate the fingerprint from her
victim and plant it into spurious images. The concept of fragile camera
fingerprints addresses this attack by exploiting asymmetries in data access:
While the camera owner will always have access to a full fingerprint from
uncompressed images, the adversary has typically access to compressed images
and thus only to a truncated fingerprint. The security of this defense,
however, has not been systematically explored yet. This paper provides the
first comprehensive analysis of fragile camera fingerprints under attack. A
series of theoretical and practical tests demonstrate that fragile camera
fingerprints allow a reliable device identification for common compression

source and destination for users to select. Hence, ranking such paths becomes
increasingly important, which directly affects the service quality. We present
PathRank, a data-driven framework for ranking paths based on historical
trajectories using multi-task learning. If a trajectory used path P from source
s to destination d, PathRank considers this as an evidence that P is preferred
over all other paths from s to d. Thus, a path that is similar to P should have
a larger ranking score than a path that is dissimilar to P. Based on this
intuition, PathRank models path ranking as a regression problem, where each
path is associated with a ranking score.
  To enable PathRank, we first propose an effective method to generate a
compact set of training data: for each trajectory, we generate a small set of
diversified paths. Next, we propose a multi-task learning framework to solve
the regression problem. In particular, a spatial network embedding is proposed
to embed each vertex to a feature vector by considering both road network
topology and spatial properties, such as distances and travel times. Since a
path is represented by a sequence of vertices, which is now a sequence of
feature vectors after embedding, recurrent neural network is applied to model
the sequence. The objective function is designed to consider errors on both
ranking scores and spatial properties, making the framework a multi-task
learning framework. Empirical studies on a substantial trajectory data set
offer insight into the designed properties of the proposed framework and
indicating that it is effective and practical.

objects and stars with transition disks) in NGC 2264 from observations obtained
with Chandra/ACIS-I and CoRoT as part of the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation

correlated, anti-correlated, or not correlated by sampling their optical and
X-ray light curves in suitable time intervals and studying the correlation
between the flux observed in optical and in X-rays. We then studied how this
classification is related with stellar properties. Results. Starting from a
sample of 74 class III/transition disk (TD) stars observed with CoRoT and
detected with Chandra with more than 60 counts, we selected 16 stars whose
optical and X-ray variability is anti-correlated, 11 correlated, and 17 where
there is no correlation. The remaining stars did not fall in any of these
groups. We interpreted the anti-correlated optical and X-ray variability as
typical of spot-dominated sources, due to the rotational modulation of
photospheric spots spatially coincident to coronal active regions, and
correlated variability typical of faculae-dominated sources, where the
brightening due to faculae is dominant over the darkening due to spots.

show that a closely related but finer grained space of measures arises --- via
Stone-Priestley duality and the notion of types from model theory --- by
enriching the expressive power of first-order logic with certain

phase transition using the methods of exact diagonalization as well as matrix
product state dynamics. We estimate the location of transition separating the
ergodic and the many-body localized phases as a function of the disorder
strength and the many-body on-site interaction strength. The main difference
between the bosonic model realized by superconducting circuits and similar
fermionic model is that the effect of the on-site interaction is stronger due
to the possibility of multiple excitations occupying the same site. The phase
transition is found to be robust upon including longer-range hopping and
interaction terms present in the experiments. Furthermore, we calculate
experimentally relevant local observables and show that their temporal
fluctuations can be used to distinguish between the dynamics of Anderson
insulator, many-body localization, and delocalized phases. While we consider
unitary dynamics, neglecting the effects of dissipation, decoherence and
measurement back action, the timescales on which the dynamics is unitary are
sufficient for observation of characteristic dynamics in the many-body
localized phase. Moreover, the experimentally available disorder strength and
interactions allow for tuning the many-body localization phase transition, thus
making the arrays of superconducting circuit devices a promising platform for
exploring localization physics and phase transition.

attack detection (PAD), was focused on boosting the performance of the systems
within a single database. Face PAD datasets are usually captured with RGB
cameras, and have very limited number of both bona-fide samples and
presentation attack instruments. Training face PAD systems on such data leads
to poor performance, even in the closed-set scenario, especially when
sophisticated attacks are involved.
  We explore two paths to boost the performance of the face PAD system against
challenging attacks. First, by using multi-channel (RGB, Depth and NIR) data,
which is still easily accessible in a number of mass production devices.
Second, we develop a novel Autoencoders + MLP based face PAD algorithm.
Moreover, instead of collecting more data for training of the proposed deep
architecture, the domain adaptation technique is proposed, transferring the
knowledge of facial appearance from RGB to multi-channel domain. We also
demonstrate, that learning the features of individual facial regions, is more
discriminative than the features learned from an entire face. The proposed

the restriction of the data distribution on a tile of a Voronoi tessellation

to natural object detection because of two major reasons: small lesion size and
small inter-class variation. Firstly, the lesions usually only occupy a small
region in the CT image. The feature of such small region may not be able to
provide sufficient information due to its limited spatial feature resolution.
Secondly, in CT scans, the lesions are often indistinguishable from the
background since the lesion and non-lesion areas may have very similar
appearances. To tackle both problems, we need to enrich the feature
representation and improve the feature discriminativeness. Therefore, we
introduce a dual-attention mechanism to the 3D contextual lesion detection
framework, including the cross-slice contextual attention to selectively
aggregate the information from different slices through a soft re-sampling
process. Moreover, we propose intra-slice spatial attention to focus the
feature learning in the most prominent regions. Our method can be easily
trained end-to-end without adding heavy overhead on the base detection network.
We use DeepLesion dataset and train a universal lesion detector to detect all
kinds of lesions such as liver tumors, lung nodules, and so on. The results
show that our model can significantly boost the results of the baseline lesion
detector (with 3D contextual information) but using much fewer slices.

for commercial handheld devices because it allows the possibility to get depth
information with minimal user effort and cooperation. Due to speed and memory
issue on these devices, the self calibration optimization of the method using
Bundle Adjustment (BA) need as little as 10-15 images. Therefore, the
optimization tends to take many iterations to converge or may not converge at
all in some cases. This work propose a robust initialization for the bundle
adjustment using the rank-1 factorization method (Tomasi and Kanade, 1992),
(Aguiar and Moura, 1999a). We create a constraint matrix that is rank-1 in a
noiseless situation, then use SVD to compute the inverse depth values and the
camera motion. We only need about quarter fraction of the bundle adjustment
iteration to converge. We also propose grided feature extraction technique so
that only important and small features are tracked all over the image frames.
This also ensure speedup in the full execution time on the mobile device. For
the experiments, we have documented the execution time with the proposed Rank-1
initialization on two mobile device platforms using optimized accelerations
with CPU-GPU co-processing. The combination of Rank 1-BA generates more robust
depth-map and is significantly faster than using BA alone.

  of Transmission Delays and Packet Drops",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the distributed weight balancing problem in networks of nodes
that are interconnected via directed edges, each of which is able to admit a
positive integer weight within a certain interval, captured by individual lower
and upper limits. A digraph with positive integer weights on its (directed)
edges is weight-balanced if, for each node, the sum of the weights of the
incoming edges equals the sum of the weights of the outgoing edges. In this
work, we develop a distributed iterative algorithm which solves the integer
weight balancing problem in the presence of arbitrary (time-varying and
inhomogeneous) time delays that might affect transmissions at particular links.
We assume that communication between neighboring nodes is bidirectional, but
unreliable since it may be affected from bounded or unbounded delays (packet
drops), independently between different links and link directions. We show
that, even when communication links are affected from bounded delays or
occasional packet drops (but not permanent communication link failures), the
proposed distributed algorithm allows the nodes to converge to a set of weight
values that solves the integer weight balancing problem, after a finite number
of iterations with probability one, as long as the necessary and sufficient
circulation conditions on the lower and upper edge weight limits are satisfied.
Finally, we provide examples to illustrate the operation and performance of the
proposed algorithms.

ambiguities remain which are expected to resolve themselves when proceeding to
the next order. Subsequently, a corresponding topological string partition
function is studied in an expansion in terms of independent invariants of $S$,

However, pre-specification is only effective if done in a way that does not

statistical method such as multiple imputation, but give little detail on how
it will be implemented. Because there are many different ways to perform

phenomena yet to be explored. In particular, the response of such solids to a
mechanical load is not well understood and, as has been demonstrated
experimentally, it differs strongly from bulk samples made of the same
materials. Failure patterns and mechanisms are strongly affected by the
geometry of the confinement and the interplay between interfacial effects in
the sample and the time scale, imposed by an external mechanical field. Here,
we present the mechanism of cavity formation in a confined model glass,
subjected to expansion with a constant strain rate. This system is studied for
varying geometric aspect ratio and sample size. Our results show that for a
given temperature and straining condition, the sample shows cavitation when the
aspect ratio reaches a critical value and below this aspect ratio the sample
breaks by forming a neck. The critical aspect ratio is associated with a
critical curvature of the neck that depends on strain rate and temperature. If
this critical curvature is exceeded, the free energy of the system is minimized
by the formation of a cavity. Our study reveals a novel mechanism of cavity
formation on the nanoscale. This is probably a generic mechanism for material's
failure in small confined systems under mechanical load.

chemical compound space. The use of a chemically transferable coarse-grained
model enables different molecular fragments to map to the same bead type, while
also reducing computational expense. These properties further increase
screening efficiency, as many compounds are screened through the use of a
single coarse-grained simulation, effectively reducing the size of chemical
compound space. Here, we propose new criteria for the rational design of
coarse-grained models that allows for the optimization of their chemical
transferability and evaluate the Martini model within this framework. We
further investigate the scope of this chemical transferability by
parameterizing three Martini-like models, in which the number of bead types
ranges from five to sixteen for the different force fields. We then implement a
Bayesian approach to determining which chemical groups are more likely to be
present on fragments corresponding to specific bead types for each model. We
demonstrate that a level of performance and accuracy comparable to Martini can
be obtained by using a force field with fewer bead types. However, the
advantage of including more bead types is a reduction of uncertainty with
respect to back-mapping these bead types to specific chemistries. Just as
reducing the size of the coarse-grained particles leads to a finer mapping of
conformational space, increasing the number of bead types yields a finer
mapping of chemical compound space. Finally, we note that, due to the
relatively large size of the chemical fragments that map to a single martini
bead, a clear resolution limit arises when using the water/octanol partition
free energy as the only descriptor when coarse-graining chemical compound
space.

degrees of freedom among the atoms are related in intricate ways. Therefore, a
variety of analysis frameworks have been introduced in order to distill complex
motions into lower-dimensional representations that model the system dynamics.
These dynamical models have been developed to optimally approximate the
system's global kinetics. However, the separate aims of optimizing global
kinetics and modeling a process of interest diverge when the process of
interest is not the slowest process in the system. Here, we introduce deflation
into state-of-the-art methods in molecular kinetics in order to preserve the
use of variational optimization tools when the slowest dynamical mode is not
the same as the one we seek to model and understand. First, we showcase
deflation for a simple toy system and introduce the deflated variational
approach to Markov processes (dVAMP). Using dVAMP, we show that nondominant
reaction coordinates produced using deflation are more informative than their
counterparts generated without deflation. Then, we examine a protein folding
system in which the slowest dynamical mode is not folding. Following a dVAMP
analysis, we show that deflation can be used to obscure this undesired slow
process from a kinetic model, in this case a VAMPnet. The incorporation of
deflation into current methods opens the door for enhanced sampling strategies
and more flexible, targeted model building.

confounding factors by quantifying the extent of confounding and causality in a

invariants, finding that men and women publish at a comparable annual rate and
have equivalent career-wise impact for the same size body of work. Finally, we
demonstrate that differences in dropout rates and career length explain a large

spectral filtering of transverse-electric-polarized guided modes propagating in
the waveguide. We demonstrate that by proper choice of the distances between
the ridges, flat-top reflectance profiles with steep slopes and virtually no
sidelobes can be obtained using just a few ridges. In particular, the structure
consisting of two ridges can optically implement the second-order Butterworth
filter, whereas at a larger number of ridges, excellent approximations to
higher-order Butterworth filters can be achieved. Owing to the BIC supported by
the ridges constituting the composite structure, the flat-top reflection band
can be made arbitrarily narrow without increasing the structure size. In
addition to the filtering properties, the investigated structures support
another type of BICs - Fabry-P\'erot BICs arising when the distances between
the adjacent ridges meet the Fabry-P\'erot resonance condition. In the vicinity
of the Fabry-P\'erot BICs, an effect similar to the electromagnetically induced
transparency is observed, namely, sharp transmittance peaks against the

comparing the results with those of the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithms

optimization strategies are proposed to find an optimal design to maximize the

result. To this end, a human-in-the-loop optimization algorithm will be used.
The solution of this optimization problem is carried out by Particle Swarm

laws lies in the famous Gibbs-Wilbraham phenomenon, once discontinuities appear

approximation will be polluted by spurious oscillations, which produce
unphysical numerical solutions and might finally blow up the computation. In
this work, we propose a new shock capturing procedure to stabilise high-order
spectral element approximations. The procedure consists of going over from the
original (polluted) approximation to a convex combination of the original
approximation and its Bernstein reconstruction, yielding a stabilised
approximation. The coefficient in the convex combination, and therefore the
procedure, is steered by a discontinuity sensor and is only activated in
troubled elements. Building up on classical Bernstein operators, we are thus
able to prove that the resulting Bernstein procedure is total variation
diminishing and preserves monotone (shock) profiles. Further, the procedure can
be modified to not just preserve but also to enforce certain bounds for the
solution, such as positivity. In contrast to other shock capturing methods,
e.g. artificial viscosity methods, the new procedure does not reduce the time
step or CFL condition and can be easily and efficiently implemented into any
existing code. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed shock-capturing
procedure is able to stabilise and enhance spectral element approximations in
the presence of shocks.

the advent of the World Wide Web, a new type of virtual mobility has emerged
that has begun to supplant many traditional facets of human activity. Here we
conduct a systematic analysis of physical and virtual movement, uncovering both
similarities and differences in their statistical patterns. The differences
manifest themselves primarily in the temporal regime, as a signature of the
spatial and economic constraints inherent in physical movement, features that
are predominantly absent in the virtual space. We demonstrate that once one
moves to the time-independent space of events, i.e the sequences of visited
locations, these differences vanish, and the statistical patterns of physical
and virtual mobility are identical. The observed similarity in navigating these
markedly different domains point towards a common mechanism governing the
movement patterns, a feature we describe through a Metropolis-Hastings type
optimization model, where individuals navigate locations through
decision-making processes resembling a cost-benefit analysis of the utility of
locations. In contrast to existing phenomenological models of mobility, we show

existence of an inflection point which leads to a dynamical phase of ultra slow
roll evolution, thereby causing an enhancement of the primordial perturbation
spectrum at smaller scales. Working with a quasi-inflection point in the
potential, we find that PBHs can be produced in our scenario in the
asteroid-mass window with a nearly monochromatic mass fraction which can
account for the total dark matter in the universe. For different choices of
quasi-inflection points and other parameters of our model, we can also generate
PBHs in higher mass windows but the primordial spectrum of curvature
perturbations becomes strongly tilted at the CMB scales. Moreover, we study the
effects of a reheating epoch after the end of inflation on the PBHs mass
fraction and find that an epoch of a matter dominated reheating can shift the
mass fraction to a larger mass window as well as increase their fractional
contribution to the total dark matter even for the case of a monochromatic mass
fraction.

applications in various fields, including smart grids, healthcare, vehicular

of nodes, e.g., nodes that send emergency, periodic, and normal type data. An
important problem is to rapidly estimate the number of active nodes of each
node type in every time frame in such a network. In this paper, we design two
schemes for estimating the active node cardinalities of each node type in a
heterogeneous M2M network with $T$ types of nodes, where $T \ge 2$ is an
arbitrary integer. Our schemes consist of two phases-- in phase 1, coarse
estimates are computed, and in phase 2, these estimates are used to compute the
final estimates to the required accuracy. We analytically derive a condition
for one of our schemes that can be used to decide as to which of two possible
approaches should be used in phase 2 to minimize its execution time. The
expected number of time slots required to execute and the expected energy
consumption of each active node under one of our schemes are analysed. Using
simulations, we show that our proposed schemes require significantly fewer time
slots to execute compared to estimation schemes designed for a heterogeneous
M2M network in prior work, and also, compared to separately executing a
well-known estimation protocol designed for a homogeneous network in prior work
$T$ times to estimate the cardinalities of the $T$ node types, even though all
these schemes obtain estimates with the same accuracy.

with Sullivan's proof of the No Wandering Domains Theorem in 1985. In 2016 it
was shown, in joint work of the first and last author with Buff, Dujardin and
Raissy, that wandering domains do exist in higher dimensions. In fact,
wandering domains arise even for a seemingly simple class of maps: polynomial
skew products. While the construction gives an infinite dimensional class of
examples, and has been extended to polynomial automorphisms of $\mathbb C^4$ by
Hahn and the last author, the currently known wandering domains are essentially
unique.
  Our goal in this paper is to construct a second example, arising from similar
techniques, but with distinctly different dynamical behavior. Instead of
wandering domains arising from a Lavaurs map with an attracting fixed point, we
construct a domain arising from a Lavaurs map with a fixed point of Siegel
type.
  Siegel disks are not robust under perturbations, as opposed to attracting
fixed points. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence
of a so-called trapping domain for non-autonomous dynamical systems given by
sequences of maps converging parabolically towards a Siegel type limit map.
  Guaranteeing that this condition is satisfied in our current construction
requires a reconsideration of the proof of the original wandering domain, as
more precise estimates on the rate of convergence towards the Lavaurs map are
required. By adapting ideas introduced recently by Bedford, Smillie and Ueda,
and by proving the existence of parabolic curves, with control on their domains
of definition, we prove that the convergence rate is parabolic.

operation is to maximize the utilization of the medium by increasing the number
of parallel transmissions. Nevertheless, due to the novelty of the operation,
its performance gains remain largely unknown. In this paper, we first provide a
gentle tutorial of the SR operation included in the IEEE 802.11ax. Then, we
analytically model SR and delve into the new kinds of MAC-level interactions
among network devices. Finally, we provide a simulation-driven analysis to
showcase the potential of SR in various deployments, comprising different

to a participant are controlled through the private key of an asymmetric key
pair that is owned by the participant. Although, this lets blockchain network
participants to have sovereignty on their assets, it comes with the
responsibility of managing their own keys. Currently, there exists two major
bottlenecks in managing keys; $a)$ users don't have an efficient and secure way
to store their keys, $b)$ no efficient recovery mechanism exists in case the
keys are lost. In this study, we propose secure methods to efficiently store
and recover keys. For the first, we introduce an efficient encryption mechanism
to securely encrypt and decrypt the private key using the owner's biometric
signature. For the later, we introduce an efficient recovery mechanism using
biometrics and secret sharing scheme. By applying the proposed key encryption
and recovery mechanism, asset owners are able to securely store their keys on
their devices and recover the keys in case they are lost.

a hospital has some complicated cardinal preference and constraints. With such
preferences (e.g., submodular) and constraints (e.g., knapsack or matroid

the complexity of checking and computing stable matchings based on preference
class and constraint class. Second, we establish a framework to analyze this

determine the distillable entanglement of a bipartite state, which is equal to
the maximum rate at which fresh Bell states can be distilled from many copies
of a given bipartite state by employing local operations and classical
communication for free. It is the aim of this paper to take this kind of
question to the next level, with the main question being: What is the best way
of using free channels to convert one resourceful quantum channel to another?
Here we focus on the the resource theory of entanglement for bipartite channels
and establish several fundamental tasks and results regarding it. In
particular, we establish bounds on several pertinent information processing
tasks in channel entanglement theory, and we define several entanglement
measures for bipartite channels, including the logarithmic negativity and the
$\kappa$-entanglement. We also show that the max-Rains information of [B\""auml

core. When the core mass becomes close to the Chandrasekhar mass, the core
undergoes electron captures on $^{24}$Mg and $^{20}$Ne, which induce the
electron-capture supernova (ECSN). In order to clarify whether the ECSN leads
to a collapse or thermonuclear explosion, we calculate the evolution of an
$8.4~M_\odot$ star from the main sequence until the oxygen ignition in the
ONeMg core. We apply the latest electron-capture rate on $^{20}$Ne including
the second forbidden transition, and investigate how the location of the oxygen
ignition (center or off-center) and the $Y_e$ distribution depend on the input
physics and the treatment of the semiconvection and convection. The central
density when the oxygen deflagration is initiated, $\rho_{\rm c,def}$, can be
significantly higher than that of the oxygen ignition thanks to the convection,
and we estimate $\log_{10}(\rho_{\rm c,def}/\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}})>10.10$. We
perform two-dimensional simulations of the flame propagation to examine how the
final fate of the ONeMg core depends on the $Y_e$ distribution and $\rho_{\rm
c,def}$. We find that the deflagration starting from $\log_{10}(\rho_{\rm
c,def}/\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}})>10.01 (< 10.01)$ leads to a collapse (thermonuclear
explosion). Since our estimate of $\rho_{\rm c,def}$ exceeds this critical
value, the ONeMg core is likely to collapse, although further studies of the
convection and semiconvection before the deflagration are important.

randomized clinical trials. Knowing the amount of prior information, expressed
as an equivalent prior effective sample size (ESS), clearly facilitates trial
designs. Various methods to obtain a prior's ESS have been proposed recently.
They have been justified by the fact that they give the standard ESS for
one-parameter exponential families. However, despite being based on similar
information-based metrics, they may lead to surprisingly different ESS for
non-conjugate settings, which complicates many designs with prior information.
We show that current methods fail a basic predictive consistency criterion,
which requires the expected posterior-predictive ESS for a sample of size $N$
to be the sum of the prior ESS and $N$. The expected local-information-ratio
ESS is introduced and shown to be predictively consistent. It corrects the ESS
of current methods, as shown for normally distributed data with a heavy-tailed

the dynamics of optical absorption, mechanical losses, heat generation and

temperature regime where neutrinos are trapped and therefore have nonzero
chemical potential. We model the nuclear matter in a relativistic density
functional approach, taking into account the trapped neutrino component. We
find that the resonant maximum of the bulk viscosity would occur at or below
the neutrino trapping temperature, so in the neutrino trapped regime the bulk
viscosity decreases with temperature as $T^{-2}$, this decrease being
interrupted by a drop to zero at a special temperature where the proton
fraction becomes density-independent and the material scale-invariant. The bulk
viscosity is larger for matter with lower lepton fraction, i.e., larger isospin
asymmetry. We find that bulk viscosity in the neutrino-trapped regime is
smaller by several orders of magnitude than in the neutrino-transparent regime,
which implies that bulk viscosity in neutrino-trapped matter is probably not
strong enough to affect significantly the evolution of neutron star mergers.
This also implies weak damping of gravitational waves emitted by the

(re-ID) model trained on one dataset often achieves considerably poor accuracy

method to address the domain-shift problem for re-ID in an unsupervised manner.
Specifically, in the target domain, the re-ID model is inducted to 1) maximize
distances between all person images and 2) minimize distances between similar
person images. In the first case, by treating each person image as an
individual class, a non-parametric classifier with a feature memory is
exploited to encourage person images to move far away from each other. In the
second case, according to a similarity threshold, our method adaptively selects
neighborhoods for each person image in the feature space. By treating these
similar person images as the same class, the non-parametric classifier forces
them to stay closer. However, a problem of the adaptive selection is that, when
an image has too many neighborhoods, it is more likely to attract other images
as its neighborhoods. As a result, a minority of images may select a large
number of neighborhoods while a majority of images have only a few
neighborhoods. To address this issue, we additionally integrate a balance
strategy into the adaptive selection. We evaluate our methods with two
protocols. The first one is called ""target-only re-ID"", in which only the
unlabeled target data is used for training. The second one is called ""domain
adaptive re-ID"", in which both the source data and the target data are used

  Computation (TEAC)",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of multi-dimensional revenue maximization when selling
$m$ items to a buyer that has additive valuations for them, drawn from a
(possibly correlated) prior distribution. Unlike traditional Bayesian auction
design, we assume that the seller has a very restricted knowledge of this
prior: they only know the mean $\mu_j$ and an upper bound $\sigma_j$ on the
standard deviation of each item's marginal distribution. Our goal is to design
mechanisms that achieve good revenue against an ideal optimal auction that has
full knowledge of the distribution in advance. Informally, our main
contribution is a tight quantification of the interplay between the dispersity
of the priors and the aforementioned robust approximation ratio. Furthermore,
this can be achieved by very simple selling mechanisms.
  More precisely, we show that selling the items via separate price lotteries
achieves an $O(\log r)$ approximation ratio where $r=\max_j(\sigma_j/\mu_j)$ is
the maximum coefficient of variation across the items. To prove the result, we
leverage a price lottery for the single-item case. If forced to restrict
ourselves to deterministic mechanisms, this guarantee degrades to $O(r^2)$.
Assuming independence of the item valuations, these ratios can be further
improved by pricing the full bundle. For the case of identical means and
variances, in particular, we get a guarantee of $O(\log(r/m))$ which converges
to optimality as the number of items grows large. We demonstrate the optimality
of the above mechanisms by providing matching lower bounds. Our tight analysis
for the single-item deterministic case resolves an open gap from the work of
Azar and Micali [ITCS'13].
  As a by-product, we also show how one can directly use our upper bounds to
improve and extend previous results related to the parametric auctions of Azar
et al. [SODA'13].

Keplerian but are missing the highest velocity components close to the center

unstable against gravitational instability caused by axisymmetric
perturbations. The dominant sources cover different evolutionary stages within
the same maternal gas clump. The appearance of rotation and outflows of the

  analysis in the diffusion limit",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamical low-rank algorithms are a class of numerical methods that compute
low-rank approximations of dynamical systems. This is accomplished by
projecting the dynamics onto a low-dimensional manifold and writing the
solution directly in terms of the low-rank factors. The approach has been
successfully applied to many types of differential equations. Recently,
efficient dynamical low-rank algorithms have been applied to treat kinetic
equations, including the Vlasov--Poisson and the Boltzmann equation, where it
was demonstrated that the methods are able to capture the low-rank structure of
the solution and significantly reduce numerical cost, while often maintaining
high accuracy. However, no numerical analysis is currently available.
  In this paper, we investigate the error analysis for a dynamical low-rank
algorithm applied to the multi-scale linear Boltzmann equation (a classical
model in kinetic theory) to showcase the validity of the application of
dynamical low-rank algorithms to kinetic theory. The equation, in its parabolic
regime, is known to be rank one theoretically, and we will prove that the
scheme can dynamically and automatically capture this low-rank structure. This
work thus serves as the first mathematical error analysis for a dynamical
low-rank approximation applied to a kinetic problem.

always increases with decreasing As flux and becomes infinite at a certain
minimum flux, which is larger for higher temperature. For given As and Ga
fluxes, the incubation time always increases with temperature and rapidly tends
to infinity above 640 {\deg}C under typical conditions. The strong temperature

newly proposed schemes could be shown to reach arbitrarily high order in time
while preserving the energy dissipation law without any restriction on the time
step size (i.e., unconditionally energy stable). The HSAV strategy is rather
general that it does not depend on the specific expression of the effective
free energy, such that it applies to a class of thermodynamically consistent
gradient flow models arriving at semi-discrete high-order energy-stable
schemes. We then employ the Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial
discretization. The fully discrete schemes are also shown to be unconditionally
energy stable. Furthermore, we present several numerical experiments on several
widely-used gradient flow models, to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and
unconditionally energy stability of the HSAV schemes. The numerical results
verify that the HSAV schemes can reach the expected order of accuracy, and it
allows a much larger time step size to reach the same accuracy than the
standard SAV schemes.

originate from the fluctuations anchored by the point of continuous quantum
phase transition out of the antiferromagnetic order, i.e., a quantum critical
point. What has been unclear is how these phenomena can be associated with a
potential new phase of matter at zero temperature. Here we show that magnetic
frustration of the 4f-local moments in the distorted Kagome intermetallic
compound CePdAl gives rise to such a paramagnetic quantum-critical phase.
Moreover, we demonstrate that this phase turns into a Fermi liquid through a
Mott-like crossover; in a two-dimensional parameter space of pressure and
magnetic field, this crossover is linked to a line of zero-temperature
4f-electron localization-delocalization phase transitions at low and moderate

the number of coherent oscillations, which is given by the ratio of imaginary
and real part of the first non-trivial eigenvalue of the corresponding master

dark sector bound states can influence collider, direct and indirect searches

direct indication of the users point of attention, which can be useful in
improving human-computer interaction. Gaze estimation in a non-intrusive manner
can make human-computer interaction more natural. Eye tracking can be used for
several applications such as fatigue detection, biometric authentication,
disease diagnosis, activity recognition, alertness level estimation,
gaze-contingent display, human-computer interaction, etc. Even though
eye-tracking technology has been around for many decades, it has not found much
use in consumer applications. The main reasons are the high cost of eye
tracking hardware and lack of consumer level applications. In this work, we
attempt to address these two issues. In the first part of this work,
image-based algorithms are developed for gaze tracking which includes a new
two-stage iris center localization algorithm. We have developed a new algorithm
which works in challenging conditions such as motion blur, glint, and varying
illumination levels. A person independent gaze direction classification
framework using a convolutional neural network is also developed which
eliminates the requirement of user-specific calibration.
  In the second part of this work, we have developed two applications which can
benefit from eye tracking data. A new framework for biometric identification
based on eye movement parameters is developed. A framework for activity
recognition, using gaze data from a head-mounted eye tracker is also developed.
The information from gaze data, ego-motion, and visual features are integrated

sources, stands for a sequence of n bits, where the dependence of the i'th bit
on the previous i-1 bits is limited for every $i\in[n]$. If the dependence of
the i'th bit on the remaining n-1 bits is limited, then this is a strong
SV-source. Even the strong SV-sources are known not to admit (universal)
deterministic extractors, but they have seeded extractors, as their min-entropy
is $\Omega(n)$. It is intuitively obvious that strong SV-sources are more than
just high-min-entropy sources, and this work explores the intuition.
Deterministic condensers are known not to exist for general high-min-entropy
sources, and we construct for any constants $\epsilon, \delta \in (0,1)$ a
deterministic condenser that maps n bits coming from a strong SV-source with
bias at most $\delta$ to $\Omega(n)$ bits of min-entropy rate at least
$1-\epsilon$. In conclusion we observe that deterministic condensers are
closely related to very strong extractors - a proposed strengthening of the
notion of strong (seeded) extractors: in particular, our constructions can be
viewed as very strong extractors for the family of strong Santha-Vazirani
distributions. The notion of very strong extractors requires that the output
remains unpredictable even to someone who knows not only the seed value (as in
the case of strong extractors), but also the extractor's outputs corresponding
to the same input value with each of the preceding seed values (say, under the
lexicographic ordering). Very strong extractors closely resemble the original
notion of SV-sources, except that the bits must satisfy the unpredictability

(i) a verification in which they check---in a randomized fashion---the robust
feasibility of a candidate optimal point, and (ii) an optimization step in
which they exchange their candidate basis (the minimal set of constraints
defining a solution) with neighbors and locally solve an optimization problem.
As main result, we show that processors can stop the algorithm after a finite
number of communication rounds (either because verification has been successful
for a sufficient number of rounds or because a given threshold has been
reached), so that candidate optimal solutions are consensual. The common
solution is proven to be---with high confidence---feasible and hence optimal
for the entire set of uncertainty except a subset having an arbitrary small
probability measure. We show the effectiveness of the proposed distributed
algorithm using two examples: a random, uncertain mixed-integer linear program

and network layer (System-Level (SL)). Detailed methodologies of the LL and SL
simulators for C-V2X communication have been illustrated. In the LL simulator,
we get the mapping curves of BLER and Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), which are
used as a baseline for measuring the performance of the LL simulation. In
addition, these mapping curves are used as the important Link-to-System (L2S)
interfaces. The SL simulator is utilized for measuring the performance of cell
networking and simulating large networks comprising of multiple eNBs and UEs.
Finally, the simulation results of both simulators for CV2X communication are
presented, which shows that different objectives can be met by using LL or SL
simulations types.

generalize the approach for arbitrary windows, showing that signal windowing
introduces additional terms in the system's equations. The formalism is useful
for frequency-domain input-output analysis of a system, and also for system
identification. For the latter application, the approach considerably reduces
aliasing effects and allows the computation of the associated correction terms,
reducing the number of parameters that need to be estimated. The system

filtering out the effects of initial conditions while retaining the spectral

polarity, phase) are known in advance. The present work proposes a practical
solution to the EM wave sensing problem using the intelligent and networked MS
counterparts-the HyperSurfaces (HSFs), without requiring dedicated field
sensors. An nano-network embedded within the HSF iterates over the possible MS
configurations, finding the one that fully absorbs the impinging EM wave, hence
maximizing the energy distribution within the HSF. Using a distributed
consensus approach, the nano-network then matches the found configuration to
the most probable EM wave traits, via a static lookup table that can be created
during the HSF manufacturing. Realistic simulations demonstrate the potential
of the proposed scheme. Moreover, we show that the proposed workflow is the
first-of-its-kind embedded EM compiler, i.e., an autonomic HSF that can
translate high-level EM behavior objectives to the corresponding, low-level EM

prediction tasks for knowledge graphs. TransE is the primary model among
translation-based embeddings and is well-known for its low complexity and high
efficiency. Therefore, most of the earlier works have modified the score
function of the TransE approach in order to improve the performance of link
prediction tasks. Nevertheless, proven theoretically and experimentally, the
performance of TransE strongly depends on the loss function. Margin Ranking
Loss (MRL) has been one of the earlier loss functions which is widely used for
training TransE. However, the scores of positive triples are not necessarily
enforced to be sufficiently small to fulfill the translation from head to tail
by using relation vector (original assumption of TransE). To tackle this
problem, several loss functions have been proposed recently by adding upper
bounds and lower bounds to the scores of positive and negative samples.
Although highly effective, previously developed models suffer from an expansion
in search space for a selection of the hyperparameters (in particular the upper
and lower bounds of scores) on which the performance of the translation-based
models is highly dependent. In this paper, we propose a new loss function
dubbed Adaptive Margin Loss (AML) for training translation-based embedding
models. The formulation of the proposed loss function enables an adaptive and
automated adjustment of the margin during the learning process. Therefore,
instead of obtaining two values (upper bound and lower bound), only the center
of a margin needs to be determined. During learning, the margin is expanded
automatically until it converges. In our experiments on a set of standard
benchmark datasets including Freebase and WordNet, the effectiveness of AML is
confirmed for training TransE on link prediction tasks.

context and masked response representation. Finally, the attention weights
between each context and response representations are computed and used in the
further decoding process. Experimental results on both Chinese customer

significantly outperforms baseline models, in terms of both metric-based and

  on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing",,,,"eess.AS cs.CL cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, an ideal model has to be
applicable over multiple domains. In this paper, we propose to teach an
all-rounder with experts in different domains. Concretely, we build a
multi-domain acoustic model by applying the teacher-student training framework.
First, for each domain, a teacher model (domain-dependent model) is trained by
fine-tuning a multi-condition model with domain-specific subset. Then all these
teacher models are used to teach one single student model simultaneously. We
perform experiments on two predefined domain setups. One is domains with
different speaking styles, the other is nearfield, far-field and far-field with
noise. Moreover, two types of models are examined: deep feedforward sequential
memory network (DFSMN) and long short term memory (LSTM). Experimental results
show that the model trained with this framework outperforms not only
multi-condition model but also domain-dependent model. Specially, our training
method provides up to 10.4% relative character error rate improvement over
baseline model (multi-condition model).

fermions superimposed on an ion chain. This compound system features
(attractive) long-range interspecies interactions. By means of density matrix
renormalization group techniques we compute the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid
parameter and speed of sound as a function of the relative atom/ion density and
the two quantum defect parameters, namely, the even and odd short-range phases
which characterize the short-range part of the atom-ion polarization potential.
The presence of ions is found to allow critical tuning of the atom-atom
interaction, and the properties of the system are found to depend significantly
on the short-range phases due to the atom-ion interaction. These latter
dependencies can be controlled, for instance, by manipulating the ions'
internal state. This allows modification of the static properties of the
quantum liquid via external driving of the ionic impurities.

detector that assists end-users to identify news credibility. To effectively
detect and interpret the fakeness of news items, we jointly consider both
attributes (e.g., speaker) and statements. Specifically, MIMIC, ATTN and PERT
frameworks are designed, where MIMIC is built for attribute analysis, ATTN is
for statement semantic analysis and PERT is for statement linguistic analysis.
Beyond the explanations extracted from the designed frameworks, relevant
supporting examples as well as visualization are further provided to facilitate
the interpretation. Our implemented system is demonstrated on a real-world
dataset crawled from PolitiFact, where thousands of verified political news
have been collected.

collectors and highly concentrated among few prominent figures. We hence
propose to adapt Kleinberg's authority/hub HITS method to rate artists and
collectors in the art context. This seems a reasonable choice since the
original method deftly defines its scores in terms of a mutual recursive
relationship between authorities/artists - the miners of information/art, and
hubs/collectors - the assemblers of such information/art.
  We evaluated the proposed method on the collector-artist network of SuperRare
gallery, the major crypto art marketplace. We found that the proposed artist
and collector metrics are weakly correlated with other network science metrics
like degree and strength. This hints the possibility of coupling different
measures in order to profile active users of the gallery and suggests
investment strategies with different risk/reward ratios for collectors as well
as marketing strategies with different targets for artists.

  Effective Graph Sampling","Accepted at AAMAS 2020",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A serious challenge when finding influential actors in real-world social
networks is the lack of knowledge about the structure of the underlying
network. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on hand-crafted sampling
algorithms; these methods sample nodes and their neighbours in a carefully
constructed order and choose opinion leaders from this discovered network to
maximize influence spread in the (unknown) complete network. In this work, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework for network discovery that
automatically learns useful node and graph representations that encode
important structural properties of the network. At training time, the method
identifies portions of the network such that the nodes selected from this
sampled subgraph can effectively influence nodes in the complete network. The
realization of such transferable network structure based adaptable policies is
attributed to the meticulous design of the framework that encodes relevant node
and graph signatures driven by an appropriate reward scheme. We experiment with
real-world social networks from four different domains and show that the
policies learned by our RL agent provide a 10-36% improvement over the current
state-of-the-art method.

plasmon resonance phenomenon is presented. Plasmonic responses of noble metal
nanoparticles such as AuNPs and AgNPs have been exclusively examined by
adopting D-type and tapered optical fiber probes for the detection of methanol.
With increase in concentration of methanol, the effective refractive index of
the medium changes which leads to alter absorbance characteristics of the NPs;
thereby modulating the eventual output responses of the proposed sensor. A
comparative study has been presented with respective change in geometrical
shapes of the probes to detect methanol. The sensitivity in case of D-type
probe for detection of methanol is found to be ~0.09644 mV/ppm with AuNPs and
~0.03038 mV/ppm with AgNPs. On the other hand, the sensitivity for AgNPs coated
probe is found to be ~0.00389 mV/ppm and 0.00379 mV/ppm for AuNPs in case of
tapered probe.

new examples of discrete dynamical systems with anticipation are considered.
The mathematical formulation of problems, possible analytical formulas for
solutions and numerical examples of presumable solutions are proposed. One of
the most interesting properties in such systems is presumable multivaluedness
of the solutions. It can be considered from the point of view of dynamical
chaos and complex behavior. We represent examples of periodic and complex
solutions, attractor's properties and presumable applications in
self-organization. The main peculiarity is the strong anticipation property.
General new possibilities are the presumable multivaluedness of the dynamics of
automata. Possible interpretations of such behavior of cellular automata are
discussed. Further prospects for development of automata theory and hyper
computation are proposed.
