  Ten Years in Retrospect","7 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.GL cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last two decades, the majority of German universities adopted
various characteristics of the prevailing North-American academic system,
resulting in significant changes in several key areas that include, e.g., both
teaching and research. The universities' internal organizational structures,
however, still follow a traditional, decentralized scheme implementing an
additional organizational level -- the Chair -- effectively a ""mini department""
with dedicated staff, budget and infrastructure. Although the Technical
University of Munich (TUM) has been establishing a more centralized scheme for
many administrative tasks over the past decade, the transition from its
distributed to a centralized information technology (IT) administration and
infrastructure is still an ongoing process. In case of the authors' chair, this
migration so far included handing over all network-related operations to the
joint compute center, consolidating the Chair's legacy server system in terms
of both hardware architectures and operating systems and, lately, moving
selected services to replacements operated by Department or University. With
requirements, individuals and organizations constantly shifting, this process,
however, is neither close to completion nor particularly unique to TUM. In this
paper, we will thus share our experiences w.r.t. this IT migration as we
believe both that many of the other German universities might be facing similar
challenges and that, in the future, North-American universities - currently not
implementing the chair layer and instead relying on a centralized IT
infrastructure - could need a more decentralized solution. Hoping that both
benefit from this journey, we thus present the design, commissioning and
evolution of our infrastructure.

To promote an efficient utilization of energy storage, we develop a novel
business model to enable virtual storage sharing among a group of users.
Specifically, a storage aggregator invests and operates the central physical
storage unit, by virtualizing it into separable virtual capacities and selling
to users. Each user purchases the virtual capacity, and utilize it to reduce
the energy cost. We formulate the interaction between the aggregator and users
as a two-stage optimization problem. In Stage 1, over the investment horizon,
the aggregator determines the investment and pricing decisions. In Stage 2, in
each operational horizon, each user decides the virtual capacity to purchase
together with the operation of the virtual storage. We characterize a stepwise
form of the optimal solution of Stage-2 Problem and a piecewise linear
structure of the optimal profit of Stage-1 Problem, both with respect to the
virtual capacity price. Based on the solution structure, we design an algorithm
to attain the optimal solution of the two-stage problem. In our simulation
results, the proposed storage virtualization model can reduce the physical
energy storage investment of the aggregator by 54.3% and reduce the users'
total costs by 34.7%, compared to the case where users acquire their own
physical storage.

metallicity spread, but we do observe possible extended star formation in
several galaxies, as evidenced by a population of asymptotic giant branch stars
brighter than the red giant branch tip. The new dwarfs do not show any signs of

complementary PISCeS survey, we study the luminosity function and 3D structure

collective polaritonic excitations in a dimerized chain of oscillating dipoles
embedded inside a photonic cavity. The added degree of freedom from the cavity
photons upgrades the system from a typical SSH $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ model into a
largely unexplored $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ model. Tuning the light-matter coupling
strength by changing the cavity size reveals three critical points in parameter
space: when the polariton band gap closes, when the Zak phase changes from
being trivial to nontrivial, and when the edge state is lost. Remarkably, these
three critical points do not coincide, and thus the Zak phase is no longer an
indicator of the presence of edge states. Our discoveries demonstrate some
remarkable properties of topological matter when strongly coupled to light, and
could be important for the growing field of topological nanophotonics.

the acceleration of the center of mass induces a time variation in the redshift
of the gravitational wave, which in turn modifies its waveform. We confirm that
while the cosmological acceleration is too small to leave a detectable imprint
on the gravitational waveforms observable by LISA, larger peculiar
accelerations may be measurable for sufficiently long lived sources. We focus
on stellar mass black hole binaries, which will be detectable at low
frequencies by LISA and near coalescence by ground based detectors. These
sources may have large peculiar accelerations, for instance, if they form in
nuclear star clusters or in AGN accretion disks. If that is the case, we find
that in an astrophysical population calibrated to the LIGO-Virgo observed
merger rate, LISA will be able to measure the peculiar acceleration of a small
but significant fraction of the events if the mission lifetime is extended
beyond the nominal duration of 4 years. In this scenario LISA will be able to
assess whether black hole binaries form close to galactic centers, particularly
in AGN disks, and will thus help discriminate between different formation
mechanisms. Although for a nominal 4 years LISA mission the peculiar
acceleration effect cannot be measured, a consistent fraction of events may be
biased by strong peculiar accelerations which, if present, may imprint large
systematic errors on some waveform parameters. In particular, estimates of the
luminosity distance could be strongly biased and consequently induce large
systematic errors on LISA measurements of the Hubble constant with stellar mass
black hole binaries.

raises the question whether there might be an equally simple multi-field
realization consistent with the observations. We explore the idea that an
approximate 'angular' shift symmetry in field space (an isometry) protects the
dynamics of coupled inflationary perturbations. This idea relates to the recent
observation that multi-field inflation mimics the predictions of single-field
inflation, if the inflaton is efficiently and constantly coupled to a second
massless degree of freedom (the isocurvature perturbation). In multi-field
inflation, the inflationary trajectory is in general not aligned with the
gradient of the potential. As a corollary the potential does not reflect the
symmetries of perturbations. We propose a new method to reconstruct
simultaneously a two-field action and an inflationary trajectory which proceeds
along an `angular' direction of field space, with a constant radius of
curvature, and that has a controlled mass of `radial' isocurvature
perturbations (entropy mass). We dub this `Orbital Inflation'. In this set-up
the Hubble parameter determines the behavior of both the background and the
perturbations. First, Orbital Inflation provides a playground for quasi-single
field inflation. Second, the exquisite analytical control of these models
allows us to exactly solve the phenomenology of Orbital Inflation with a small
entropy mass and a small radius of curvature, a regime not previously explored.
The predictions are single-field-like, although the consistency relations are
violated. Moreover, the value of the entropy mass dictates how the inflationary
predictions fan out in the ($n_s$, $r$) plane. Depending on the size of the
self interactions of the isocurvature perturbations, the non-Gaussianity
parameter $f_{NL}$ can range from slow-roll suppressed to $\mathcal{O}(\text{a
few})$.

simulation with a thick, ion-scale equilibrium current sheet (CS) reveals that
the X-line spreads at the ambient ion/electron drift speeds, significantly
slower than the Alfv\'en speed based on the guide field $V_{Ag}$. Additional
simulations with a thinner, sub-ion-scale CS show that the X-line spreads at
$V_{Ag}$ (Alfv\'enic spreading), much higher than the ambient species drifts.
An Alfv\'enic signal consistent with kinetic Alfv\'en waves develops and
propagates, leading to CS thinning and extending, which then results in
reconnection onset. The continuous onset of reconnection in the signal
propagation direction manifests as Alfv\'enic X-line spreading. The strong
dependence on the CS thickness of the spreading speeds, and the X-line
orientation are consistent with the collisionless tearing instability. Our
simulations indicate that when the collisionless tearing growth is sufficiently
strong in a thinner CS such that $\gamma/\Omega_{ci}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(1)$,
Alfv\'enic X-line spreading can take place. Our results compare favorably with
a number of numerical simulations and recent magnetopause observations. A key
implications is that the magnetopause CS is typically too thick for Alfv\'enic
X-line spreading to effectively take place.

quantum circuits on them. Here, certain physical constraints given by the
architectures which restrict the allowed interactions of the involved qubits
have to be satisfied. Thus far, this has been addressed by inserting SWAP and H
operations. However, it remains unknown whether existing methods add a minimum
number of SWAP and H operations or, if not, how far they are away from that
minimum--an NP-complete problem. In this work, we address this by formulating
the mapping task as a symbolic optimization problem that is solved using
reasoning engines like Boolean satisfiability solvers. By this, we do not only
provide a method that maps quantum circuits to IBM's QX architectures with a
minimal number of SWAP and H operations, but also show by experimental
evaluation that the number of operations added by IBM's heuristic solution
exceeds the lower bound by more than 100% on average. An implementation of the

impact of flavor violating neutral current NSI parameter
$\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ in the oscillation of atmospheric neutrino and
antineutrino using the 50 kt magnetized ICAL detector at INO. We find that due
to non-zero $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$, $\nu_\mu\rightarrow\nu_\mu$ and
$\bar\nu_\mu\rightarrow\bar\nu_\mu$ transition probabilities get modified
substantially at higher energies and longer baselines, where vacuum oscillation
dominates. We estimate the sensitivity of the ICAL detector for various choices
of binning schemes and observables. The most optimistic bound on
$\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ that we obtain is $-0.01 < \varepsilon_{\mu\tau} < 0.01

identification capability of the ICAL detector is crucial to set stringent
constraints on $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$. We also show that when we marginalize
over $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ in fit in its range of -0.1 to 0.1, the mass
hierarchy sensitivity deteriorates by 10$\%$ to 20$\%$ depending on the

quite robust at the ICAL detector.

essential role in explaining the characteristics revealed in multiwavelength
observations. In this paper, the TeV-gamma-ray-emitting electrons in the Vela X
PWN are approximated to be injected impulsively when the cocoon is formed due
to the interaction between the SNR reverse shock and the PWN. By solving the
diffusion-loss equation analytically, we reproduce the broadband spectral
energy distribution and surface brightness profile simultaneously. The
diffusion coefficient of TeV electrons and positrons, which is well constrained
by the spectral and spatial properties of the TeV nebula, is thus determined to
be $1 \times 10^{26}$\,cm$^{2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for 10\,TeV electrons and positrons.
This coefficient is more than three orders of magnitude lower than that in the

al.\,2019); here, we account for the broadband photon spectrum of the ERN.
Since the diffusive escape of the electrons from the TeV emitting region is
expected to play an insignificant role in shaping the spectrum of the ERN, we
attribute the GeV cutoff of the ERN to the reverse shock-PWN interaction. Due
to the disruption of the reverse shock, most of plasma of the PWN is driven
into the ERN. During the subsequent reverberation phase, the ERN could be
compressed by a large factor in radius, and the magnetic field in the ERN is
thus significantly enhanced, burning off the high energy electrons. We thus
obtain the electron spectrum of the ERN and the broadband spectrum of the ERN
are explained satisfactorily.

stabilize a dynamical transportation network whenever the exogenous inflows

decentralized and fully scalable as they rely on local feedback information

strategies, the GPA control policies do not require any global information

them robust to demand variations and unpredicted changes in the link capacities

level statistically indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM and at the same time
predicts very large deviations from General Relativity (GR) in the propagation
of gravitational waves (GWs) across cosmological distances. The model is a
variant of the RT nonlocal model proposed and developed by our group, with
initial conditions set during inflation, and predicts a GW luminosity distance
that, at the redshifts accessible to LISA or to a third-generation GW detector
such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), can differ from that in GR by as much as
$60\%$. An effect of this size could be detected with just a single standard
siren with counterpart by LISA or ET. At the redshifts accessible to a
LIGO/Virgo/Kagra network at target sensitivity the effect is smaller but still
potentially detectable. Indeed, for the recently announced LIGO/Virgo NS-BH
candidate S190814bv, the RT model predicts that, given the measured GW
luminosity distance, the actual luminosity distance, and the redshift of an
electromagnetic counterpart, would be smaller by as much as $7\%$ with respect
to the value inferred from $\Lambda$CDM.

indicator of the past of planetary systems. It is however not always clear
whether the eccentricity fitted on radial velocity data is real or if it is an
artefact of an inappropriate modelling. In this work, we address this question
in two steps: we first assume that the model used for inference is correct and
present interesting features of classical estimators. Secondly, we study
whether the eccentricity estimates are to be trusted when the data contain
incorrectly modelled signals, such as missed planetary companions, non Gaussian
noises, correlated noises with unknown covariance, etc. Our main conclusion is
that data analysis via posterior distributions, with a model including a free
error term gives reliable results provided two conditions. First, convergence
of the numerical methods needs to be ascertained. Secondly, the noise power
spectrum should not have a particularly strong peak at the semi period of the
planet of interest. As a consequence, it is difficult to determine if the
signal of an apparently eccentric planet might be due to another inner
companion in 2:1 mean motion resonance. We study the use of Bayes factors to
disentangle these cases. Finally, we suggest methods to check if there are
hints of an incorrect model in the residuals. We show on simulated data the
performance of our methods and comment on the eccentricities of Proxima b and

DropConnect techniques to induce sparsity, our scheme considers feature
importance as a criterion to allocate the trainable parameters (resources)
efficiently in the network. Even though sparsity is ensured, $\ell_1$
regularization requires training on all the resources in a deep neural network.
The DropOut/DropConnect techniques reduce the number of trainable parameters in
the training stage by dropping a random collection of neurons/edges in the
hidden layers. However, both these techniques do not pay heed to the underlying
structure in the data when dropping the neurons/edges. Moreover, these
frameworks require a storage space equivalent to the number of parameters in a
fully connected neural network. We address the above issues with a more
structured architecture inspired from spatially-coupled sparse constructions.
The proposed architecture is shown to have a performance akin to a conventional
fully connected neural network with dropouts, and yet achieving a $94\%$
reduction in the training parameters. Extensive simulations are presented and
the performance of the proposed scheme is compared against traditional neural

HyperFlowCutter builds on the FlowCutter algorithm for partitioning graphs. We
propose additional features, such as handling disconnected hypergraphs, novel

algorithm which obtains an initial partition with the fast multilevel
hypergraph partitioner PaToH and then improves it using HyperFlowCutter as a
refinement algorithm. ReBaHFC is able to significantly improve the solution
quality of PaToH at little additional running time. The solution quality is
only marginally worse than that of the best-performing hypergraph partitioners
KaHyPar and hMETIS, while being one order of magnitude faster. Thus ReBaHFC
offers a new time-quality trade-off in the current spectrum of hypergraph
partitioners. For the special case of perfectly balanced bipartitioning, only
the much slower plain HyperFlowCutter yields slightly better solutions than
ReBaHFC, while only PaToH is faster than ReBaHFC.

can be used to improve surgeon training and, ultimately, patient care through
focused training interventions. Machine learning models to automatically
recognize individual tasks or activities are needed to overcome the otherwise
manual effort of video review. Traditionally, these models have been evaluated
using frame-level accuracy. Here, we propose evaluating surgical activity
recognition models by their effect on task-based efficiency metrics. In this
way, we can determine when models have achieved adequate performance for
providing surgeon feedback via metrics from individual tasks.
  Methods: We propose a new CNN-LSTM model, RP-Net-V2, to recognize the 12
steps of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomies (RARP). We evaluated our
model both in terms of conventional methods (e.g. Jaccard Index, task boundary
accuracy) as well as novel ways, such as the accuracy of efficiency metrics
computed from instrument movements and system events.
  Results: Our proposed model achieves a Jaccard Index of 0.85 thereby
outperforming previous models on robotic-assisted radical prostatectomies.
Additionally, we show that metrics computed from tasks automatically identified
using RP-Net-V2 correlate well with metrics from tasks labeled by clinical
experts.
  Conclusions: We demonstrate that metrics-based evaluation of surgical
activity recognition models is a viable approach to determine when models can
be used to quantify surgical efficiencies. We believe this approach and our
results illustrate the potential for fully automated, post-operative efficiency
reports.

Sr, Ba, and Eu. The majority of abundances are compatible with those of halo

similar metallicity. Pal 15 is enhanced to [Mg/Fe]=0.45 dex, while other

representative for [$\alpha$/Fe], and coupled with the lack of any significant
spread in any of the studied elements we conclude that Pal 15 is typical of the

and masses and regular spacings, and that planet pairs usually show ordered
sizes such that the outer planet is usually the larger one. Here I show that
these patterns can be largely explained by detection biases. The \emph{Kepler}
planet detections are set by the transit signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). For
different stellar properties and orbital period values, the same S/N
corresponds to different planetary sizes. This variation in the detection
threshold naturally leads to apparent correlations in planet sizes and the
observed size ordering. The apparently correlated spacings, measured in period
ratios, between adjacent planet pairs in systems with at least three detected
planets are partially due to the arbitrary upper limit that the earlier study
imposed on the period ratio, and partially due to the varying stability
threshold for different planets. After these detection biases are taken into
account, we do not find strong evidence for the so-called ""intra-system
uniformity"" or the size ordering effect. Instead, the physical properties of
\emph{Kepler} planets are largely independent of the properties of their
siblings and the parent star. It is likely that the dynamical evolution has
erased the memory of \emph{Kepler} planets about their initial formation
conditions. In other words, it will be difficult to infer the initial
conditions from the observed properties and the architecture of \emph{Kepler}

We associate antihermitian forms of unit determinant over Laurent polynomial

that every 2D TI Clifford QCA is trivial since the antihermitian form in this

any TI Clifford QCA is trivial.
  We present explicit examples of nontrivial TI Clifford QCA for $D=3$ and any

necessarily Clifford or translation invariant, is a constant depth quantum

disappearance of zero-bias peaks within the cores of topological vortices upon
increase of the applied magnetic field. The presence of magnetic impurities in
FeTe$_{(1-x)}$Se$_x$, which are attracted to the vortices, would lead to such
Zeeman-induced delocalization of Majorana modes in a fraction of vortices that

simulations to study the role of the post-merger magnetic geometry in the
evolution of merger remnant discs around stationary Kerr black holes. Our
simulations fully capture mass accretion, ejection, and jet production, owing
to their exceptionally long duration exceeding $4$ s. Poloidal post-merger
magnetic field configurations produce jets with energies $E_\mathrm{jet} \sim

$E_\mathrm{iso}\sim(4{-}20)\times10^{52}$ erg, opening angles
$\theta_\mathrm{jet}\sim6{-}13^\circ$, and durations $t_j\lesssim1$ s.
Accompanying the production of jets is the ejection of
$f_\mathrm{ej}\sim30{-}40\%$ of the post-merger disc mass, continuing out to
times $> 1$ s. We discover that a more natural, purely toroidal post-merger
magnetic field geometry generates large-scale poloidal magnetic flux of
alternating polarity and striped jets. The first stripe, of
$E_\mathrm{jet}\simeq2\times10^{48}\,\mathrm{erg}$, $E_\mathrm{iso}\sim10^{51}$
erg, $\theta_\mathrm{jet}\sim3.5{-}5^\circ$, and $t_j\sim0.1$ s, is followed by
$\gtrsim4$ s of striped jet activity with $f_\mathrm{ej}\simeq27\%$. The
dissipation of such stripes could power the short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) prompt
emission. Our simulated jet energies and durations span the range of sGRBs. We
find that although the blue kilonova component is initially hidden from view by
the red component, it expands faster, outruns the red component, and becomes
visible to off-axis observers. In comparison to GW 170817/GRB 170817A, our

induce the formation of two protostellar companions at distances of ~1000 au

approach and orbit the primary on eccentric orbits with separations of ~100 au.
The colliding flows induce transient structures lasting for up to a few 10 kyr

along the line-of-sight. Colliding flows compress the gas and trigger the
formation of stellar companions via turbulent fragmentation. Our results
suggest that protostellar companions form with a wide separation of ~1000 au.
Smaller separations (~100 au or less) are a consequence of subsequent migration
and capturing. Associated with the formation phase of the companion, the
turbulent environment induces arc- and bridge-like structures. These bridges
can become kinematically quiescent, when the velocity components of the
colliding flows eliminate each other. However, the gas in bridges still
contributes to stellar accretion later. Our results demonstrate: bridge-like
structures are a transient phenomenon of stellar multiple formation.

of two states and single-qubit gates only make a rotation in the Bloch sphere.
The key ingredient to circumvent these limitations is to allow for multiple
data re-uploading. A quantum circuit can then be organized as a series of data
re-uploading and single-qubit processing units. Furthermore, both data
re-uploading and measurements can accommodate multiple dimensions in the input
and several categories in the output, to conform to a universal quantum
classifier. The extension of this idea to several qubits enhances the
efficiency of the strategy as entanglement expands the superpositions carried
along with the classification. Extensive benchmarking on different examples of
the single- and multi-qubit quantum classifier validates its ability to
describe and classify complex data.

compare the predictions of this scenario with the ATLAS search for long-lived

optimization of the trigger requirements by means of a high level trigger that
exploits tracker information. The analysis is carried out in the general case

special attention to reproduce the current experimental data on neutrino and

oscillation data are reproduced. We find that important regions of the

bimodality, featuring a passively evolving red sequence and a star-forming blue
cloud. The region between these two, the Green Valley (GV), represents a
fundamental transition where quenching processes operate. We exploit an
alternative definition of the GV using the 4,000 Angstrom break strength, an
indicator that is more resilient than colour to dust attenuation. We compare
and contrast our GV definition with the traditional one, based on
dust-corrected colour, making use of data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
Our GV selection - that does not need a dust correction and thus does not carry
the inherent systematics - reveals very similar trends regarding nebular
activity (star formation, AGN, quiescence) to the standard dust-corrected
$^{0.1}(g-r)$. By use of high SNR stacked spectra of the quiescent GV
subsample, we derive the simple stellar population (SSP) age difference across
the GV, a rough proxy of the quenching timescale ($\Delta$t). We obtain an
increasing trend with velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), from
$\Delta$t$\sim$1.5Gyr at $\sigma$=100km/s, up to 3.5Gyr at $\sigma$=200km/s,
followed by a rapid decrease in the most massive GV galaxies
($\Delta$t$\sim$1Gyr at $\sigma$=250km/s), suggesting two different modes of
quenching, or the presence of an additional channel (rejuvenation).

6876 and the surrounding globular cluster system (GCS). The host galaxy is a
massive elliptical, the brightest of this type in the Pavo Group. According to
its intrinsic brightness (M_v~-22.7), it is expected to belong to a galaxy
cluster instead of a poor group. Observational material consists of g', r', i'
images obtained with the Gemini/GMOS camera. The selected globular cluster (GC)
candidates present a clear bimodal colour distribution at different
galactocentric radii, with mean colours and dispersions for the metal-poor
(""blue"") and metal-rich (""red"") typical of old GCs. The red subpopulation
dominates close to the galaxy centre, in addition to the radial projected
distribution showing that they are more concentrated towards the galaxy centre.
The azimuthal projected distribution shows an overdensity in the red
subpopulation in the direction of a trail observed in X-ray that could be
evidence of interactions with its spiral neighbour NGC 6872. The turn-over of
the luminosity function gives an estimated distance modulus (m - M)~ 33.5 and
the total population amounts to 9400 GCs, i.e. a quite populous system. The
halo mass obtained using the number ratio (i.e. the number of GCs with respect
to the baryonic and dark mass) gives a total of ~10^13, meaning it is a very
massive galaxy, given the environment.

planets, at least three of which orbit in the habitable zone. The radio
emission of such low-mass stars is poorly understood; few UCDs have been
detected at radio frequencies at all, and the likelihood of detection is only
loosely correlated with stellar properties. Relative to other low-mass stars,
UCDs with slow rotation such as TRAPPIST-1 tend to be radio dim, whereas
rapidly rotating UCDs tend to have strong radio emission - although this is not
always the case. We present radio observations of TRAPPIST-1 using ALMA at 97.5
GHz and the VLA at 44 GHz. TRAPPIST-1 was not detected at either frequency and
we place $3 \sigma$ upper flux limits of 10.6 and 16.2 $\mu$Jy, respectively.
We use our results to constrain the magnetic properties and possible outgoing
high energy particle radiation from the star. The presence of radio emission
from UCDs is indicative of a stellar environment that could pose a threat to
life on surrounding planets. Gyrosynchrotron emission, discernible at
frequencies between 20 and 100 GHz, is one of the only processes that can be
used to infer the presence of high energy particles released during magnetic
reconnection events. Since M dwarfs are frequent hosts of terrestrial planets,
characterizing their stellar emission is a crucial part of assessing
habitability. Exposure to outgoing high energy particle radiation - traceable
by radio flux - can erode planetary atmospheres. While our results do not imply
that the TRAPPIST-1 planets are suitable for life, we find no evidence that
they are overtly unsuitable due to proton fluxes.

Here, we investigated the barocaloric effects in WTR and polymer blends made of
vulcanized natural rubber (VNR) and WTR, in order to evaluate its feasibility
for solid-state cooling technologies. The adiabatic temperature change and the
isothermal entropy change reach giant values, as well as the performance
parameters, being comparable or even better than most barocaloric materials in
literature. Moreover, pure WTR and WTR-based samples also present a faster
thermal exchange than VNR, consisting in an additional advantage of using these
discarded materials. Thus, the present findings evidence the encouraging
perspectives of employing waste rubbers in solid-state cooling based on
barocaloric effect, contributing in both the recycling of polymers and the
sustainable energy technology field.

Gluing over 3-edge cuts has been used in algorithms for finding Hamilton cycles

multigraphs. We apply this approach to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) in
the case when the objective function of the subtour elimination relaxation is

where the support graph is subcubic and each vertex is incident to at least one
edge with $x$-value 1. Such points are sufficient to resolve TSP in general.
For these points, we construct a convex combination of tours in which we can
reduce the usage of edges with $x$-value 1 from the $\frac{3}{2}$ of
Christofides algorithm to $\frac{3}{2}-\frac{\theta}{10}$ while keeping the
usage of edges with fractional $x$-value the same as Christofides algorithm. A
direct consequence of this result is for the Uniform Cover Problem for TSP: In
the case when the objective function of the subtour elimination relaxation is
minimized by a $\frac{2}{3}$-uniform point: $x_e \in \{0, \frac{2}{3}\}$, we
give a $\frac{17}{12}$-approximation algorithm for TSP. For such points, this

efficiency due to the significantly higher energy consumption of off-chip DRAM
accesses than arithmetic or SRAM operations. It motivates the intensive
research on model compression with two main approaches. Weight pruning
leverages the redundancy in the number of weights and can be performed in a
non-structured, which has higher flexibility and pruning rate but incurs index
accesses due to irregular weights, or structured manner, which preserves the
full matrix structure with lower pruning rate. Weight quantization leverages
the redundancy in the number of bits in weights. Compared to pruning,
quantization is much more hardware-friendly, and has become a ""must-do"" step
for FPGA and ASIC implementations. This paper provides a definitive answer to
the question for the first time. First, we build ADMM-NN-S by extending and

outperforms the prior art: (i) it achieves 348x, 36x, and 8x overall weight
pruning on LeNet-5, AlexNet, and ResNet-50, respectively, with (almost) zero
accuracy loss; (ii) we demonstrate the first fully binarized (for all layers)
DNNs can be lossless in accuracy in many cases. These results provide a strong
baseline and credibility of our study. Based on the proposed comparison
framework, with the same accuracy and quantization, the results show that
non-structrued pruning is not competitive in terms of both storage and
computation efficiency. Thus, we conclude that non-structured pruning is
considered harmful. We urge the community not to continue the DNN inference
acceleration for non-structured sparsity.

extended the applicability of the polaron-based framework to study
nonequilibrium process beyond the super-Ohmic bath models. Previously, the
polaron-based framework for quantum heat transport reduces exactly to the
non-interacting blip approximation (NIBA) formalism for Ohmic bath models due
to the issue of the infrared divergence associated with the full polaron
transformation. The nonequilibrium variational method allows us to
appropriately treat the infrared divergence in the low-frequency bath modes and
explicitly include cross-bath correlation effects. These improvements provide
more accurate calculation of heat current than the NIBA formalism for Ohmic
bath models. We illustrate the aforementioned improvements with the
nonequilibrium spin-boson model in this work and quantitatively demonstrate the
cross-bath correlation, current turnover, and rectification effects in quantum

presents NullAway, a new type-based null safety checker for Java that overcomes
these issues. NullAway has been carefully engineered for low overhead, so it
can run as part of every build. Further, NullAway reduces annotation burden
through targeted unsound assumptions, aiming for no false negatives in practice
on checked code. Our evaluation shows that NullAway has significantly lower

NullAway, remaining NPEs were due to unchecked third-party libraries (64%),

motion of an atom, coupled to a quantum real scalar field, in the presence of a
static imperfect mirror. Our study consists of two parts: in the first, we
consider accelerated motion in free space, namely, switching off the coupling
to the mirror. This results in motion induced radiation, which we quantify via
the vacuum persistence amplitude. In the model we use, the atom is described by
a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). We show that its natural frequency poses a
threshold which separates different regimes, involving or not the internal
excitation of the oscillator, with the ulterior emission of a photon. At higher
orders in the coupling to the field, pairs of photons may be created by virtue
of the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE). In the second part, we switch on the
coupling to the mirror, which we describe by localized microscopic degrees of
freedom. We show that this leads to the existence of quantum contactless
friction as well as to corrections to the free space emission considered in the
first part. The latter are similar to the effect of a dielectric on the
spontaneous emission of an excited atom. We have found that, when the atom is
accelerated and close to the plate, it is crucial to take into account the
losses in the dielectric in order to obtain finite results for the vacuum
persistence amplitude.

GEMM call, but convolutions with larger kernels require a special memory layout
transformation - im2col or im2row - to fit into GEMM interface.
  The Indirect Convolution algorithm provides the efficiency of the GEMM
primitive without the overhead of im2col transformation. In contrast to
GEMM-based algorithms, the Indirect Convolution does not reshuffle the data to
fit into the GEMM primitive but introduces an indirection buffer - a buffer of
pointers to the start of each row of image pixels. This broadens the
application of our modified GEMM function to convolutions with arbitrary kernel
size, padding, stride, and dilation.
  The Indirect Convolution algorithm reduces memory overhead proportionally to
the number of input channels and outperforms the GEMM-based algorithm by up to
62% on convolution parameters which involve im2col transformations in
GEMM-based algorithms. This, however, comes at cost of minor performance

temperatures of about 1 million Kelvin and luminosities well in excess of what
can be produced by stellar coronae. It has generally been presumed that the
objects in this class are binary star systems in which mass transfer leads to
nuclear fusion on the surface of a white dwarf. Classical novae, the runaway
fusion events on the surfaces of white dwarfs, generally have supersoft phases,
and it is often stated that the bright steady supersoft X-ray sources seen from
white dwarfs accreting mass at a high rate are undergoing steady nuclear
fusion. In this letter, we report the discovery of a transient supersoft source
in the Small Magellanic Cloud without any signature of nuclear fusion having
taken place. This discovery indicates that the X-ray emission probably comes
from a ""spreading layer"" - a belt on the surface of the white dwarf near the
inner edge of the accretion disk in which a large fraction of the total
accretion energy is emitted - and (albeit more tentatively) that the accreting
white dwarf is relatively massive. We thus establish that the presence of a
supersoft source cannot always be used as a tracer of nuclear fusion, in
contradiction with decades-old consensus about the nature of supersoft
emission.

of advection on the distribution of current in a cylindrically symmetric

current enclosed between each plasma fluid element and the axis is conserved,
and so the current profile maintains its shape. We show that for more general
velocity profiles, this simple behavior quickly breaks down, allowing for
non-conservation of current in a compressing conductor, rapid redistribution of
the current density, and even for the formation of reverse currents. In
particular, a specific inward radial velocity profile is shown to result in
radially-outward motion of the current channel, recovering the surprising
current evolution discovered at the Weizmann Institute.

$\gamma$. Thresholds determined numerically are compared with quenched

not change the overall picture: QMF and PQMF provide estimates that are
asymptotically correct for large size for $\gamma<5/2$, while they only capture
the vanishing of the threshold for $\gamma>5/2$, failing to reproduce
quantitatively how this occurs. For a given size, PQMF is more accurate. We
relate the variations in the accuracy of QMF and PQMF predictions with changes
in the spectral properties (spectral gap and localization) of standard and
modified adjacency matrices, which rule the epidemic prevalence near the
transition point, depending on the theoretical framework. We also show that,
for $\gamma<5/2$, while QMF provides an estimate of the epidemic threshold that

place at the edge devices for multiple reasons such as achieving shorter
latency, relieving the burden of the network connecting to the cloud, and
protecting user privacy. The Convolutional Neural Network (\emph{CNN}) is one
of the most widely used model family in the applications. Given the high
computational complexity of the CNN models, it is favorable to execute them on
the integrated GPUs at the edge devices, which are ubiquitous and have more
power and better energy efficiency than the accompanying CPUs. However,
programming on integrated GPUs efficiently is challenging due to the variety of
their architectures and programming interfaces. This paper proposes an
end-to-end solution to execute CNN model inference on the integrated GPUs at
the edge, which uses a unified IR to represent and optimize vision-specific
operators on integrated GPUs from multiple vendors, as well as leverages
machine learning-based scheduling search schemes to optimize
computationally-intensive operators like convolution. Our solution even
provides a fallback mechanism for operators not suitable or convenient to run
on GPUs. The evaluation results suggest that compared to state-of-the-art
solutions backed up by the vendor-provided high-performance libraries on Intel

achieves similar, or even better (up to 1.62$\times$), performance on a number
of popular image classification and object detection models. In addition, our
solution has a wider model coverage and is more flexible to embrace new models.
Our solution has been adopted in production services in AWS and is

sense that they are perfect utility maximizers, and explain economic dynamics
in terms of shocks that drive the economy away from the stead-state. Here we
build on a standard macroeconomic model in which a single rational
representative household makes a savings decision of how much to consume or
invest. In our model households are myopic boundedly rational heterogeneous
agents embedded in a social network. From time to time each household updates
its savings rate by copying the savings rate of its neighbor with the highest
consumption. If the updating time is short, the economy is stuck in a poverty
trap, but for longer updating times economic output approaches its optimal
value, and we observe a critical transition to an economy with irregular
endogenous oscillations in economic output, resembling a business cycle. In
this regime households divide into two groups: Poor households with low savings
rates and rich households with high savings rates. Thus inequality and economic
dynamics both occur spontaneously as a consequence of imperfect household
decision making. Our work here supports an alternative program of research that
substitutes utility maximization for behaviorally grounded decision making.

conflicts over resources. These strategies range from sharing resources without
outward signs of conflict to the development of dominance hierarchies, in which
initial fighting is followed by the submission of subordinates. Although models
have been developed to analyze specific strategies for resolving conflicts over
resources, little work has focused on trying to understand why particular
strategies are more likely to arise in certain situations. In this paper, we
use a model based on an iterated Hawk--Dove game to analyze how resource
holding potentials (RHPs) and other factors affect whether sharing, dominance
relationships, or other behaviours are evolutionarily stable. We find through
extensive numerical simulations that sharing is stable only when the cost of
fighting is low and the animals in a contest have similar RHPs, whereas
dominance relationships are stable in most other situations. We also explore
what happens when animals are unable to assess each other's RHPs without
fighting, and we compare a range of strategies for this problem using
simulations. We find (1) that the most successful strategies involve a limited
period of assessment followed by a stable relationship in which fights are
avoided and (2) that the duration of assessment depends both on the costliness
of fighting and on the difference between the animals' RHPs. Along with our

GS98), the solar standard model is in reasonable agreement with the
helioseismic constraints. However, a solar model with revised composition

  Policies for DRAM Caches",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates intelligent replacement policies for improving the
hit-rate of gigascale DRAM caches. Cache replacement policies are commonly used
to improve the hit-rate of on-chip caches. The most effective replacement
policies often require the cache to track per-line reuse state to inform their
decision. A fundamental challenge on DRAM caches, however, is that stateful
policies would require significant bandwidth to maintain per-line DRAM cache
state. As such, DRAM cache replacement policies have primarily been stateless
policies, such as always-install or probabilistic bypass. Unfortunately, we
find that stateless policies are often too coarse-grain and become ineffective
at the size and associativity of DRAM caches. Ideally, we want a replacement
policy that can obtain the hit-rate benefits of stateful replacement policies,
but keep the bandwidth-efficiency of stateless policies.
  In our study, we find that tracking per-line reuse state can enable an
effective replacement policy that can mitigate common thrashing patterns seen
in gigascale caches. We propose a stateful replacement/bypass policy called
RRIP Age-On-Bypass (RRIP-AOB), that tracks reuse state for high-reuse lines,
protects such lines by bypassing other lines, and Ages the state On cache
Bypass. Unfortunately, such a stateful technique requires significant bandwidth
to update state. To this end, we propose Efficient Tracking of Reuse (ETR). ETR
makes state tracking efficient by accurately tracking the state of only one
line from a region, and using the state of that line to guide the replacement
decisions for other lines in that region. ETR reduces the bandwidth for
tracking replacement state by 70%, and makes stateful policies practical for
DRAM caches. Our evaluations with a 2GB DRAM cache, show that our RRIP-AOB and
ETR techniques provide 18% speedup while needing less than 1KB of SRAM.

As a response to this goal, the weak value amplification approach has been
developed for measuring ultra-small physical effects, realizing sensitivity
that had never been reached before. Encouraged by the successes, many efforts
have been devoted to obtain ultimate sensitivity of weak value amplification.
However, the benefit would be easily compromised in practice, because the cost
of significant reduction on signal intensity leads to an ultra-low
signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing an
alternative weak value amplification approach, which provides sensitivity
several orders of magnitude higher than the standard approach while being
compatible with practical imperfections. In the proof-of-principle experiment
of measuring longitudinal phase change in time-domain, sensitivity up to
$5\times10^{-4}$ attosecond is exemplified. Our approach can be applied to
measure other small parameters with extremely high sensitivity, providing a new

this issue has not been sufficiently investigated from the aspect of

a generalization error regarding DNNs with intrinsically low dimensional

obtain inferences on these statistical models, a substantial number of

optimally designed experiments are useful as they may reduce the total number

for describing charged electronic excitations, and it has been successfully
applied to a wide range of extended systems for several decades using a
plane-wave basis. However, the $GW$ approximation has been used to test limited
spectral properties of a limited set of finite systems (e.g. frontier orbital
energies of closed-shell $sp$ molecules) only for about a decade using a
local-orbital basis. Here, we calculate the quasiparticle spectra of closed-
and open-shell molecular anions with partially and completely filled 3$d$
shells (shallow and deep 3$d$ states, respectively), ScO$^{-}$, TiO$^{-}$,
CuO$^{-}$, and ZnO$^{-}$, using various levels of $GW$ theory, and compare them
to experiments to evaluate the performance of the $GW$ approximation on the
electronic structure of small molecules containing 3$d$ transition metals. We
find that the $G$-only eigenvalue self-consistent $GW$ scheme with $W$ fixed to
the PBE level ($G_{n}W_{0}$@PBE), which gives the best compromise between
accuracy and efficiency for solids, also gives good results for both localized
($d$) and delocalized ($sp$) states of 3$d$-transition-metal oxide molecules.
The success of $G_{n}W_{0}$@PBE in predicting electronic excitations in these
systems reasonably well is likely due to the fortuitous cancellation effect
between the overscreening of the Coulomb interaction by PBE and the
underscreening by the neglect of vertex corrections. Together with the absence
of the self-consistent field convergence error (e.g. spin contamination in
open-shell systems) and the $GW$ multi-solution issue, the $G_{n}W_{0}$@PBE
scheme gives the possibility to predict the electronic structure of complex
real systems (e.g. molecule-solid and $sp$-$d$ hybrid systems) accurately and
efficiently.

potential technologies for addressing the issue of rapidly growing demand in
mobile data services related to 5G cellular networks. It logically decouples
the current cellular networks into two entities; infrastructure providers
(InPs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). The resources of base
stations (e.g., resource blocks, transmission power, antennas) which are owned
by the InP are shared to multiple MVNOs who need resources for their mobile
users. Specifically, the physical resources of an InP are abstracted into
multiple isolated network slices, which are then allocated to MVNO's mobile
users. In this paper, two-level allocation problem in network slicing is
examined, whilst enabling efficient resource utilization, inter-slice isolation
(i.e., no interference amongst slices), and intra-slice isolation (i.e., no
interference between users in the same slice). A generalized Kelly mechanism
(GKM) is also designed, based on which the upper level of the resource
allocation issue (i.e., between the InP and MVNOs) is addressed. The benefit of
using such a resource bidding and allocation framework is that the seller (InP)
does not need to know the true valuation of the bidders (MVNOs). For solving
the lower level of resource allocation issue (i.e., between MVNOs and their
mobile users), the optimal resource allocation is derived from each MVNO to its
mobile users by using KKT conditions. Then, bandwidth resources are allocated
to the users of MVNOs. Finally, the results of simulation are presented to
verify the theoretical analysis of our proposed two-level resource allocation
problem in wireless network slicing.

by a two-dimensional (2D) Brillouin zone, to the modes of the corresponding
bulk material, which are defined by a three-dimensional (3D) Brillouin zone, is
proposed. The algorithm is based on normal mode decomposition and is inspired
by the observation that the atomic motions generated by the 2D eigenvectors
lead to standing-wave-like behaviors in the cross-plane direction. It is
applied to films between two and ten unit cells thick built from Lennard-Jones
(LJ) argon, whose bulk is isotropic, and graphene, whose bulk (graphite) is
anisotropic. For LJ argon, the density of states deviates from that of the bulk
as the film gets thinner due to phonon frequencies that shift to lower values.
This shift is a result of transverse branch splitting due to the film's
anisotropy and the emergence of a quadratic acoustic branch. As such, while the
mapping algorithm works well for the thicker LJ argon films, it does not
perform as well for the thinner films as there is a weaker correspondence
between the 2D and 3D modes. For graphene, the density of states of even the
thinnest films closely matches that of graphite due to the inherent anisotropy,
except for a small shift at low frequency. As a result, the mapping algorithm
works well for all thicknesses of the graphene films, indicating a strong
correspondence between the 2D and 3D modes.

  Misses in Hybrid Memory Systems",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates bandwidth-efficient DRAM caching for hybrid DRAM +
3D-XPoint memories. 3D-XPoint is becoming a viable alternative to DRAM as it
enables high-capacity and non-volatile main memory systems; however, 3D-XPoint
has 4-8x slower read, and worse writes. As such, effective DRAM caching in
front of 3D-XPoint is important to enable a high-capacity, low-latency, and
high-write-bandwidth memory. There are two major approaches for DRAM cache
design: (1) a Tag-Inside-Cacheline (TIC) organization that optimizes for hits,
by storing tag next to each line such that one access gets both tag and data,
and (2) a Tag-Outside-Cacheline (TOC) organization that optimizes for misses,
by storing tags from multiple data-lines together such that one tag-access gets
info for several data-lines. Ideally, we desire the low hit-latency of TIC, and
the low miss-bandwidth of TOC. To this end, we propose TicToc, an organization
that provisions both TIC and TOC to get hit and miss benefits of both.
  However, we find that naively combining both actually performs worse than
TIC, because one needs to pay bandwidth to maintain both metadata. The main
contribution of this work is developing architectural techniques to reduce the
bandwidth of maintaining both TIC and TOC metadata. We find the majority of the
bandwidth cost is due to maintaining TOC dirty bits. We propose DRAM Cache
Dirtiness Bit, which carries DRAM cache dirty info to last-level caches, to
prune repeated dirty-bit checks for known dirty lines. We then propose
Preemptive Dirty Marking, which predicts which lines will be written and
proactively marks dirty bit at install time, to amortize the initial dirty-bit
update. Our evaluations on a 4GB DRAM cache with 3D-XPoint memory show that
TicToc enables 10% speedup over baseline TIC, nearing 14% speedup possible with
an idealized DRAM cache w/ 64MB of SRAM tags, while needing only 34KB SRAM.

jointly learn a model without data sharing. As a leading algorithm in this
setting, Federated Averaging (\texttt{FedAvg}) runs Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) in parallel on a small subset of the total devices and averages the
sequences only once in a while. Despite its simplicity, it lacks theoretical
guarantees under realistic settings. In this paper, we analyze the convergence
of \texttt{FedAvg} on non-iid data and establish a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ for strongly convex and smooth problems, where $T$
is the number of SGDs. Importantly, our bound demonstrates a trade-off between
communication-efficiency and convergence rate. As user devices may be
disconnected from the server, we relax the assumption of full device
participation to partial device participation and study different averaging
schemes; low device participation rate can be achieved without severely slowing
down the learning. Our results indicate that heterogeneity of data slows down
the convergence, which matches empirical observations. Furthermore, we provide
a necessary condition for \texttt{FedAvg} on non-iid data: the learning rate
$\eta$ must decay, even if full-gradient is used; otherwise, the solution will
be $\Omega (\eta)$ away from the optimal.

for the design and evaluation of a lower extremity exoskeleton that is
elastically strapped onto human lower limbs. The exoskeleton has 3 rotational
DOFs on each side and weighs 23kg. Two torque compensation controllers of the
exoskeleton are introduced, aiming to minimize interference and maximize
assistance to human motions, respectively. Their effects on the wearer's
biomechanical loadings are studied with a running motion and predicted ground
reaction forces. It is found that the added weight of the passive exoskeleton
substantially increases the wearer's musculoskeletal loadings. The maximizing
assistance controller reduces the knee joint torque by almost a half when
compared to the passive exoskeleton and the resultant torque is only 72% of
that from the normal running without exoskeleton. When compared to the normal
running, this controller also reduces the hip flexion and extension torques by
31% and 38%, respectively. As a result, the peak activations of the biceps
short head, gluteus maximus, and rectus femoris muscles are reduced by more
than a half. Nonetheless, the axial knee joint reaction force increases for all
exoskeleton cases due to the added weight and higher GRFs. In summary, the
results provide sound evidence of the efficacy of these two controllers on
reducing the wearer's musculoskeletal loadings when compared to the passive
exoskeleton. And it is shown the human-in-the-loop simulation paradigm
presented here can be used for virtual design and evaluation of powered
exoskeletons and pave the way for building optimized exoskeleton prototypes for
experimental evaluation.

Then, researchers have to utilize labeled SE-related texts to customize
sentiment analysis for SE tasks via a variety of algorithms. However, the
scarce labeled data can cover only very limited expressions and thus cannot
guarantee the analysis quality. To address such a problem, we turn to the
easily available emoji usage data for help. More specifically, we employ
emotional emojis as noisy labels of sentiments and propose a representation
learning approach that uses both Tweets and GitHub posts containing emojis to

general sentiment patterns shared across domains. They as well as labeled data
are used to learn the final sentiment classifier. Compared to the existing
sentiment analysis methods used in SE, the proposed approach can achieve
significant improvement on representative benchmark datasets. By further

potentials and Rashba spin-orbit interactions exhibit a striking quantum
criticality. As disorder strength $W$ increases, the systems undergo a
transition from a normal diffusive metal consisting of extended states to a
marginal metal consisting of critical states at a critical disorder $W_{c,1}$.
Further increase of $W$, another transition from the marginal metal to an
insulator occurs at $W_{c,2}$. Through highly accurate numerical procedures
based on the recursive Green's function method and the exact diagonalization,
we elucidate the nature of the quantum criticality and the properties of the

single-parameter scaling law: They collapse onto two branches of curves
corresponding to diffusive metal phase and insulating phase with correlation
lengths diverging exponentially as $\xi\propto\exp[\alpha/\sqrt{|W-W_c|}]$ near
transition points. Finite-size analysis of inverse participation ratios reveals
that the states within the critical regime $[W_{c,1},W_{c,2}]$ are fractals of
a universal fractal dimension $D=1.90\pm0.02$ while those in metallic

lamellar phase instead of fibrillar networks. The mechanical properties of
these materials are controlled by defects, induced by local accumulation of a
polymer or surfactant in a classical lipid bilayer. Herein we report a new
class of lipid lamellar hydrogels composed of one single bolaform glycosylated
lipid obtained by fermentation. The lipid is self-organized into flat
interdigitated membranes, stabilized by electrostatic repulsive forces and
stacked in micrometer-sized lamellar domains. The defects in the membranes and
the interconnection of the lamellar domains are responsible, from the nano- to
the micrometer scales, for the elastic properties of the hydrogels. The
lamellar structure is probed by combining small angle x-ray and neutron
scattering (SAXS, SANS), the defect-rich lamellar domains are visualized by
polarized light microscopy while the elastic properties are studied by
oscillatory rheology. The latter show that both storage G' and loss G'' moduli
scale as a weak power-law of the frequency, that can be fitted with fractional
rheology models. The hydrogels possess rheo-thinning properties with
second-scale recovery. We also show that ionic strength is not only necessary,
as one could expect, to control the interactions in the lamellar phase but,
most importantly, it directly controls the elastic properties of the lamellar
gels.

proposes a novel method that enables distillation of dataset-based knowledge
from the TN using an attention network. The knowledge of the embedding

multi-task learning is performed to give relational inductive bias to the SN.
The MHA can provide clear information about the source dataset, which can
greatly improves the performance of the SN. Experimental results show that the

star explosions to investigate the impact on SN observables of inhomogeneities
in density or composition, with a characteristic scale set to a few percent of
the local radius. Clumping is found to hasten the release of stored radiation,
boosting the early time luminosity and shortening the photospheric phase.
Around the photosphere, radiation leaks between the clumps where the photon
mean free path is greater. Since radiation is stored uniformly in volume, a
greater clumping can increase this leakage by storing more and more mass into
smaller and denser clumps containing less and less radiation energy. An
inhomogeneous medium in which different regions recombine at different
temperatures can also impact the light curve. Clumping can thus be a source of
diversity in SN brightness. Clumping may lead to a systematic underestimate of
ejecta masses from light curve modeling, although a significant offset seems to
require a large density contrast of a few tens between clumps and interclump
medium.

transmission losses due to absorption/scattering in the channel are the major
source of error for most distributed quantum information tasks. Of course
quantum error detection (QED) /correction (QEC) techniques can be used to
mitigate such effects but error detection approaches have severe performance
limitations due to the signaling constraints between nodes and so error
correction approaches are preferable -assuming one has sufficient high quality

more than one qubit of information and so our focus in this work is to explore
whether loss-based QEC codes utilizing quantum multiplexed photons are viable

contamination via the recently proposed Imputation-Regularization Optimization
procedure designed for missing data. Our method is shown to perform better than
the naive method that ignores measurement error in both identification and

making cost-effective decisions concerning road maintenance. Conventional crack
detection algorithms focus on the design of single or multiple crack features
and classifiers. However, complicated topological structures, varying degrees
of damage and oil stains make the design of crack features difficult. In
addition, the contextual information around a crack is not investigated
extensively in the design process. Accordingly, these design features have
limited discriminative adaptability and cannot fuse effectively with the
classifiers. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a deep learning
network for pavement crack detection. Using the Encoder-Decoder structure,
crack characteristics with multiple contexts are automatically learned, and
end-to-end crack detection is achieved. Specifically, we first propose the
Multi-Dilation (MD) module, which can synthesize the crack features of multiple
context sizes via dilated convolution with multiple rates. The crack MD
features obtained in this module can describe cracks of different widths and
topologies. Next, we propose the SE-Upsampling (SEU) module, which uses the
Squeeze-and-Excitation learning operation to optimize the MD features. Finally,
the above two modules are integrated to develop the fast crack detection
network, namely, FPCNet. This network continuously optimizes the MD features
step-by-step to realize fast pixel-level crack detection. Experiments are
conducted on challenging public CFD datasets and G45 crack datasets involving
various crack types under different shooting conditions. The distinct
performance and speed improvements over all the datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art crack detection methods.

main-sequence stars with stellar mass from 0.4 to 0.85\,$M_\odot$ observed by
LAMOST and {\emph Gaia} in the solar neighborhood. By adopting a power-law
shape of the mass-ratio distribution with power index of $\gamma$, we conduct a
hierarchical Bayesian model to derive the binary fraction ($f_{b}$) and
$\gamma$ for stellar populations with different metallicities and primary
masses ($m_1$). We find that $f_b$ is tightly anti-correlated with $\gamma$,
i.e. the populations with smaller binary fraction contains more binaries with
larger mass-ratio and vice versa.The high-$\gamma$ populations with
$\gamma>1.2$ have lower stellar mass and higher metallicity, while the
low-$\gamma$ populations with $\gamma<1.2$ have larger mass or lower
metallicity. The $f_b$ of the high-$\gamma$ group is anti-correlated with
[Fe/H] but flat with $m_1$.Meanwhile, the $f_b$ of the low-$\gamma$ group
displays clear correlation with $m_1$ but quite flat with [Fe/H]. The
substantial differences are likely due to the dynamical processing when the
binaries were in the embedded star clusters in their early days. The dynamical
processing tends to destroy binaries with smaller primary mass, smaller
mass-ratio, and wider separation. Consequently, the high-$\gamma$ group
containing smaller $m_1$ is more effectively influenced and hence contains less
binaries, many of which have larger mass-ratio and shorter period. However, the
low-$\gamma$ group is less affected by the dynamical processing due to their
larger $m_1$. These are evident that the dynamical processing does effectively
work and significantly reshape the present-day binary properties of field
stars.

the microscopic noise breaks the statistical tilt symmetry, or Galilean
invariance, of the original KPZ equation with delta-correlated noise (denoted
SR-KPZ). Thus it is not clear whether the KPZ universality class is preserved
in this case. Conflicting results exist in the literature, some advocating that
it is destroyed even in the limit of infinitesimal temporal correlations, while
others find that it persists up to a critical range of such correlations. Using
non-perturbative and functional renormalization group techniques, we study the
influence of two types of temporal correlators of the noise: a short-range one
with a typical time-scale $\tau$, and a power-law one with a varying exponent
$\theta$. We show that for the short-range noise with any finite $\tau$, the
symmetries (the Galilean symmetry, and the time-reversal one in $1+1$
dimension) are dynamically restored at large scales, such that the
long-distance and long-time properties are governed by the SR-KPZ fixed point.
In the presence of a power-law noise, we find that the SR-KPZ fixed point is
still stable for $\theta$ below a critical value $\theta_{\textrm{th}}$, in
accordance with previous renormalization group results, while a long-range
fixed point controls the critical scaling for $\theta>\theta_{\textrm{th}}$,
and we evaluate the $\theta$-dependent critical exponents at this long-range
fixed point, in both $1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions. While the results in $1+1$
dimension can be compared with previous studies, no other prediction was

small-enough number, to enable visualization of the behavior of the ML model;
(2) Of small-enough size, to enable interpretability of the features
themselves; (3) Of sufficient informative power, to retain or even improve the
performance of the ML algorithm. We consider a simple feature construction
scheme using three different GP algorithms, as well as random search, to evolve
features for five ML algorithms, including support vector machines and random
forest. Our results on 21 datasets pertaining to classification and regression
problems show that constructing only two compact features can be sufficient to
rival the use of the entire original feature set. We further find that a modern
GP algorithm, GP-GOMEA, performs best overall. These results, combined with
examples that we provide of readable constructed features and of 2D
visualizations of ML behavior, lead us to positively conclude that GP-based
feature construction still works well when explicitly searching for compact
features, making it extremely helpful to explain ML models.

increasing the Bi content the K and M band minima moves away from the

shifts rapidly downward and approaches the conduction band minimum. But the
favorable six-fold degenerate CB1 band minimum keeps dominating the conduction
band minimum and there is no band crossing between the $\Gamma$ and CB1 band
minima. In addition, we show that the connection of the CB1 carrier pockets
with the energy level close to the band minimum M can strongly enhance the
carrier pocket anisotropy and Fermi surface complexity factor, which is likely
the electronic origin for the local maximum in the theoretical power factor.
Our calculations also show that the band gap, density of states effective mass,
Seebeck coefficient, and Fermi surface complexity factor decrease with
increasing the Bi content, which is unfavorable to the electrical transport.
However, reducing the conductivity effective mass with increasing the Bi
content is beneficial to the electrical transport by improving carrier mobility
and weighted mobility as long as the detrimental bipolar effect is
insignificant. As a result, in comparison with n-type Mg3Sb2, n-type Mg3SbBi
shows higher power factors and a much lower optimal carrier concentration for
the theoretical power factor at 300 K, which can be easily achieved by the

in-depth exploration and characterization of the stellar content in their outer
regions, which ultimately are key to tracing the epochs and nature of past
interactions. We present new deep images of a shell-like over-density of stars
in the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The shell, also detected
in photographic plates dating back to the fifties, is located at ~1.9 degr from
the center of the SMC in the north-east direction.The structure and stellar
content of this feature were studied with multi-band, optical data from the
Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH) carried out with the Dark
Energy Camera on the Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory. We also investigate the kinematic of the stars in the shell using
the Gaia Data Release 2. The shell is composed of a young population with an
age ~ 150 Myr, with no contribution from an old population. Thus, it is hard to
explain its origin as the remnant of a tidally disrupted stellar system. The
spatial distribution of the young main-sequence stars shows a rich
sub-structure, with a spiral arm-like feature emanating from the main shell and
a separated small arc of young stars close to the globular cluster NGC 362. We
find that the absolute g-band magnitude of the shell is M_{g,shell} = -10.78+/-
0.02, with a surface brightness of mu_{g,shell} = 25.81+/- 0.01 mag/arcsec^{2}.
We have not found any evidence that this feature is of tidal origin or a bright
part of a spiral arm-like structure. Instead, we suggest that the shell formed
in a recent star formation event, likely triggered by an interaction with the
Large Magellanic Cloud and/or the Milky Way, ~150 Myr ago.

is simulated to analyse the effects of the Stokes number and the lift force on
the particle spatial distribution. The fluid friction Reynolds number is
approximately 900 over the bump, the highest achieved for similar computational
domains. A range of particle Stokes numbers are considered, each simulated with
and without the lift force in the particle dynamic equation. When the lift
force is included a significant difference in the particle concentration, in
the order of thousands, is observed in comparison with cases where the lift
force is omitted. The greatest deviation is in regions of high vorticity,
particularly at the walls and in the shear layer but results show that the
concentration also changes in the bulk of the flow away from the walls. The
particle behaviour changes drastically when the Stokes number is varied. As the
Stokes number increases, particles bypass the recirculating region that is
formed after the bump and their redistribution is mostly affected by the strong
shear layer. Particles segregate at the walls and particularly accumulate in
secondary recirculating regions behind the bump. At higher Stokes numbers, the
particles create reflection layers of high concentration due to their inertia
as they are diverted by the bump. The fluid flow is less influential and this
enables the particles to enter the recirculating region by rebounding off walls
and create a focus of high particle concentration.

For ensembles of oscillators, a classical example of phase reduction is the

equation (MF-CGLE). Still, the Kuramoto model is a first-order phase
approximation that displays either full synchronization or incoherence, but
none of the nontrivial dynamics of the MF-CGLE. This fact calls for an
expansion beyond the first order in the coupling constant. We develop an
isochron-based scheme to obtain the second-order phase approximation, which
reproduces the weak coupling dynamics of the MF-CGLE. The practicality of our
method is evidenced by extending the calculation up to third order. Each new

multi-body (i.e.non-pairwise) interactions. This points to intricate multi-body
phase interactions as the source of pure collective chaos in the MF-CGLE at

ontology presented in the framework of 5G standardization bodies and we propose
an ONAP-compatible model on the basis of which we illustrate the design,
onboarding, instantiation and distribution of a network slice. We concretely
define and deploy a network slice implementing a private and customized mobile

In this paper, we propose a learned fast HEVC intra coding (LFHI) framework
taking into account the comprehensive factors of fast intra coding to reach an
improved configurable tradeoff between coding performance and computational
complexity. First, we design a low-complex shallow asymmetric-kernel CNN
(AK-CNN) to efficiently extract the local directional texture features of each

introduce the concept of the minimum number of RDO candidates (MNRC) into fast
mode decision, which utilizes AK-CNN to predict the minimum number of best
candidates for RDO calculation to further reduce the computation of intra-mode
selection. Third, an evolution optimized threshold decision (EOTD) scheme is
designed to achieve configurable complexity-efficiency tradeoffs. Finally, we
propose an interpolation-based prediction scheme that allows for our framework
to be generalized to all quantization parameters (QPs) without the need for
training the network on each QP. The experimental results demonstrate that the
LFHI framework has a high degree of parallelism and achieves a much better
complexity-efficiency tradeoff, achieving up to 75.2% intra-mode encoding
complexity reduction with negligible rate-distortion performance degradation,
superior to the existing fast intra-coding schemes.

time for parallelization and performance tuning. The basic idea of FDPS is to
provide a high-performance implementation of parallel algorithms for
particle-based simulations in a ""generic"" form, so that researchers can define
their own particle data structure and interparticle interaction functions and
supply them to FDPS. FDPS compiled with user-supplied data type and interaction
function provides all necessary functions for parallelization, and using those
functions researchers can write their programs as though they are writing
simple non-parallel program. It has been possible to use accelerators with
FDPS, by writing the interaction function that uses the accelerator. However,
the efficiency was limited by the latency and bandwidth of communication
between the CPU and the accelerator and also by the mismatch between the
available degree of parallelism of the interaction function and that of the
hardware parallelism. We have modified the interface of user-provided
interaction function so that accelerators are more efficiently used. We also
implemented new techniques which reduce the amount of work on the side of CPU
and amount of communication between CPU and accelerators. We have measured the
performance of N-body simulations on a systems with NVIDIA Volta GPGPU using
FDPS and the achieved performance is around 27 \% of the theoretical peak
limit. We have constructed a detailed performance model, and found that the
current implementation can achieve good performance on systems with much

exhibited asymmetric, sub-critical Rayleigh breakup with an upward (i.e.
opposite to the direction of gravity) ejection of a jet from the levitated

lead to an asymmetric breakup such that the Rayleigh fission occurs upwards via
the ejection of a jet at the pole of the deformed drop. As an important

have shown that the union of all these different zones is also a zone. This

aggregates these zones into a single zone.
  We show that such aggregated zones can be calculated more efficiently using
the local time semantics and the related notion of local zones proposed by
Bengtsson et al. in 1998. Next, we point out a flaw in the existing method to
ensure termination of the local zone graph computation. We fix this with a new
algorithm that builds the local zone graph and uses abstraction techniques over
(standard) zones for termination. We evaluate our algorithm on standard

using the type Ia supernovae from Union 2.1 dataset. The paper also discusses
the dependency of dynamic dark energy EoS parameters on the chosen or assumed
value of the Hubble Constant. To understand the correlation between the Hubble
Constant values and measured dynamic dark energy EoS parameters, we used recent
surveys being done through various techniques such as cosmic microwave
background studies, gravitational waves, baryonic acoustic oscillations and
standard candles to set values for different Hubble Constant values as fixed
parameters with CPL and WCDM models. Then we applied trust region reflective
(TRF) and dog leg (dogbox) algorithms to fit dark energy density parameter and
dynamic dark energy EoS parameters. We found a significant negative correlation
between the fixed Hubble Constant parameter and measured EoS parameter, w0.
Then we used two best fit Hubble Constant values (70 and 69.18474) km $s^{-1}$
$Mpc^{-1}$ based on Chi-square test to test more dark energy EoS parameters
like: JBP, BA, PADE-I, PADE-II, and LH4 models and compared the results with
$\Lambda$-CDM with constant $w_{de}$=-1, WCDM and CPL models. We conclude that
flat $\Lambda$-CDM and WCDM models clearly provide best results while using the
BIC criteria as it severely penalizes the use of extra parameters. However, the
dependency of EoS parameters on Hubble Constant value and the increasing
tension in the measurement of Hubble Constant values using different techniques
warrants further investigation into looking for optimal dynamic dark energy EoS
models to optimally model the relation between the expansion rate and evolution
of dark energy in our universe.

another transformation recently introduced in [Gessel et al. 2012] and studied

recently, it was proposed to add a near detector to the JUNO experiment. A
model-independent treatment of the spectrum uncertainty will be discussed, as
well as the effect that it will have on the final result. Moreover, since the
neutrino spectrum depends on the chemical composition of the fuel, the spectra
at the near and far detectors will be different, because they will receive
neutrinos from different cores. Taking into account the time evolution of the
chemical composition of the fuel in the reactor core, it is possible to
reconstruct the far detector spectrum from the near detector data. We will show
that the method used to reconstruct the spectrum can affect sensitivity to the
mass hierarchy, however if the near detector is large enough the difference
will be negligible.

been studied under various algorithmic settings. Recently, the problem of
approximately counting retractions was considered. We give a complete
trichotomy for the complexity of approximately counting retractions to all
square-free graphs (graphs that do not contain a cycle of length $4$). It turns
out there is a rich and interesting class of graphs for which this problem is
complete in the class $\#\mathrm{BIS}$. As retractions generalise
homomorphisms, our easiness results extend to the important problem of
approximately counting homomorphisms. By giving new $\#\mathrm{BIS}$-easiness
results we now settle the complexity of approximately counting homomorphisms
for a whole class of non-trivial graphs which were previously unresolved.

introducing our model we apply it on two examples: prices offered by petrol

specifically, we consider a general system in which a wireless user with
limited cache storage requests cachable content from a data center that can be
directly accessed through a base station. The user can be assisted by a pair of
wireless helpers that exchange non-cachable content as well. Packets arrive at
the queue of the source helper in bursts. Each helper has its own cache to
assist the user's requests for cachable content. Files not available from the
helpers are transmitted by the base station. We analyze the system throughput
and the delay experienced by the user and show how they are affected by the
packet arrival rate at the source helper, the availability of caching helpers,
the caches' parameters, and the user's request rate by means of numerical

axonal permeability, could be an important biomarker for understanding
demyelinating pathologies such as Multiple Sclerosis. Diffusion-Weighted MRI is
sensitive to changes in permeability, however, the parameter has remained
elusive due to the intractability of the mathematical models that incorporate
it. Machine learning based computational models can potentially be used to
estimate such parameters, and recently, a theoretical framework using a random
forest (RF) suggests this is a promising approach. In this study, we adopt such
an RF approach and experimentally investigate its suitability as a biomarker
for demyelinating pathologies through direct comparison with histology. For
this, we use an in-vivo cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model of demyelination with
available ex-vivo electron microscopy (EM) data. We test our model on
noise-free simulations and find very strong correlations between the predicted
and ground truth parameters. For realistic noise levels as in our in-vivo data,
the performance is affected, however, the parameters are still well estimated.
We apply our RF model on in-vivo data from 8 CPZ and 8 wild-type (WT) mice and
validate the RF estimates using histology. We find a strong correlation between
the in-vivo RF estimates of {\tau}i and the EM measurements of myelin thickness
({\rho_\tau}i = 0.82), and between RF estimates and EM measurements of
intra-axonal volume fraction ({\rho_f} = 0.98). When comparing {\tau}i in CPZ
and WT mice we find a statistically significant decrease in the corpus callosum
of the CPZ compared to the WT mice, in line with our expectations that {\tau}i
is lower in regions where the myelin sheath is damaged. Overall, these results
demonstrate the suitability of machine learning compartment models with
permeability as a potential biomarker for demyelinating pathologies.

surveys. Light from a supernova propagates through a perturbed Universe so the
luminosity distance is modified from its homogeneous prediction. This
modification is proportional to the matter density fluctuation and its time
derivative due to gravitational lensing and peculiar velocity respectively. At
low redshifts, the peculiar velocity signal dominates while at high redshifts
lensing does. We show that using lensing and peculiar velocity of supernovae
from the upcoming surveys WFIRST and ZTF, without other observations, we can
constrain $\Sigma m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.31$ eV, $\sigma(w_0) \lesssim 0.02$, and
${\sigma(w_a)} \lesssim 0.18$ ($1-\sigma$ CL) in the $\Sigma

emission to map out neutral hydrogen in large volumes of the universe.
Unfortunately, large spatial scales are completely contaminated with spectrally
smooth astrophysical foregrounds which are orders of magnitude brighter than
the signal. This contamination also leaks into smaller radial and angular modes
to form a foreground wedge, further limiting the usefulness of 21-cm
observations for different science cases, especially cross-correlations with
tracers that have wide kernels in the radial direction. In this paper, we
investigate reconstructing these modes within a forward modeling framework.
Starting with an initial density field, a suitable bias parameterization and
non-linear dynamics to model the observed 21-cm field, our reconstruction
proceeds by combining the likelihood of a forward simulation to match the
observations (under given modeling error and a data noise model) with the
Gaussian prior on initial conditions and maximizing the obtained posterior. For
redshifts $z=2$ and $4$, we are able to reconstruct 21cm field with cross
correlation, $r_c > 0.8$ on all scales for both our optimistic and pessimistic
assumptions about foreground contamination and for different levels of thermal
noise. The performance deteriorates slightly at $z=6$. The large-scale
line-of-sight modes are reconstructed almost perfectly. We demonstrate how our
method also reconstructs baryon acoustic oscillations, outperforming standard
methods on all scales. We also describe how our reconstructed field can provide
superb clustering redshift estimation at high redshifts, where it is otherwise
extremely difficult to obtain dense spectroscopic samples, as well as open up
cross-correlation opportunities with projected fields (e.g. lensing) which are
restricted to modes transverse to the line of sight.

parameter: the $k$ in $k$-means. To this day, there is not one generally
accepted way to accurately determine this parameter. Popular methods are simple
yet theoretically unfounded, such as searching for an elbow in the curve of a
given cost measure. In contrast, statistically founded methods often make
strict assumptions over the data distribution or come with their own
optimization scheme for the clustering objective. This limits either the set of
applicable datasets or clustering algorithms. In this paper, we strive to
determine the number of clusters by answering a simple question: given two
clusters, is it likely that they jointly stem from a single distribution? To
this end, we propose a bound on the probability that two clusters originate
from the distribution of the unified cluster, specified only by the sample mean
and variance. Our method is applicable as a simple wrapper to the result of any
clustering method minimizing the objective of $k$-means, which includes
Gaussian mixtures and Spectral Clustering. We focus in our experimental
evaluation on an application for nonconvex clustering and demonstrate the
suitability of our theoretical results. Our \textsc{SpecialK} clustering
algorithm automatically determines the appropriate value for $k$, without
requiring any data transformation or projection, and without assumptions on the
data distribution. Additionally, it is capable to decide that the data consists
of only a single cluster, which many existing algorithms cannot.

data analysis. To overcome the deficiency of linear correlation in practical
multi-view learning tasks, various CCA variants were proposed to capture
nonlinear dependency. However, it is non-trivial to have an in-principle
understanding of these variants due to their inherent restrictive assumption on
the data and latent code distributions. Although some works have studied
probabilistic interpretation for CCA, these models still require the explicit
form of the distributions to achieve a tractable solution for the inference. In
this work, we study probabilistic interpretation for CCA based on implicit
distributions. We present Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) as a new
criterion for CCA to consider both linear and nonlinear dependency for
arbitrarily distributed data. To eliminate direct estimation for CMI, in which
explicit form of the distributions is still required, we derive an objective
which can provide an estimation for CMI with efficient inference methods. To
facilitate Bayesian inference of multi-view analysis, we propose Adversarial
CCA (ACCA), which achieves consistent encoding for multi-view data with the
consistent constraint imposed on the marginalization of the implicit
posteriors. Such a model would achieve superiority in the alignment of the
multi-view data with implicit distributions. It is interesting to note that
most of the existing CCA variants can be connected with our proposed CCA model
by assigning specific form for the posterior and likelihood distributions.
Extensive experiments on nonlinear correlation analysis and cross-view
generation on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of
our model.

memory polynomial (SMP) approach, contains multiple parallel complex
spline-interpolated LUTs together with an input delay line such that more

provided, with specific focus on 5G New Radio (NR) systems, showing successful
linearization of multiple sub-6 GHz PA samples as well as a 28 GHz active

performance-complexity comparisons are also reported between the SPH and SMP
DPD systems and the widely-applied ordinary memory-polynomial (MP) DPD

in a critical state based on the size distribution of network-wide avalanches
of activity, and the results of this analysis are reported here. This
classification of critical versus non-critical networks is valuable in
identifying networks that can be expected to perform well on computational
tasks, as criticality is widely considered to be the state in which a system is
best suited for computation. This type of analysis is expected to enable the
identification of networks that are well-suited for computation and the

solution for gaze point prediction of the target persons in a scene.
Specifically, in the first stage, both head image and its position are fed into
a gaze direction pathway to predict the gaze direction, and then multi-scale
gaze direction fields are generated to characterize the distribution of gaze
points without considering the scene contents. In the second stage, the
multi-scale gaze direction fields are concatenated with the image contents and
fed into a heatmap pathway for heatmap regression. There are two merits for our
two-stage solution based gaze following: i) our solution mimics the behavior of
human in gaze following, therefore it is more psychological plausible; ii)
besides using heatmap to supervise the output of our network, we can also
leverage gaze direction to facilitate the training of gaze direction pathway,
therefore our network can be more robustly trained. Considering that existing
gaze following dataset is annotated by the third-view persons, we build a video
gaze following dataset, where the ground truth is annotated by the observers in

their exciton Bohr radius receive a rapidly increasing attention due to their
unique physicochemical properties such as strong quantum confinement, large
surface-to-volume ratio, and giant oscillator strength. These superior
properties highly depend on the shape and crystal phase of semiconductor NCs.
Slight changes in the shape and phase of NCs can cause significant changes in
their properties. Therefore, it is crucial to controllably synthesize
semiconductor NCs. Here, we demonstrate not only the synthesis of robust
well-defined ultrathin ZnS nanoplatelets (NPLs) with excitonic absorption and
emission, but also the precise shape and phase control of ZnS NCs based on a
soft template strategy. The key feature of our approach is the tuning of the
sulfur precursor amount, resulting in a simultaneous shape/phase transformation
between wurtzite (WZ) ZnS NPLs and zinc blende (ZB) ZnS nanorods (NRs) at
moderate temperatures (150 degree). UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra reveal very distinct optical properties between WZ-ZnS NPLs and
ZB-ZnS NRs. UV-vis absorption spectra of WZ-ZnS NPLs clearly exhibit a sharp
excitonic peak that is not observed in ZB-ZnS NRs. Besides, the PL
characterization shows that WZ-ZnS NPLs have a narrow excitonic emission peak
(292 nm), while the ZB-ZnS NRs exhibit a broad collective emission band
consisting of four emission peaks (335, 359, 395, and 468 nm). The appearance
of excitonic features in the absorption spectra of ZnS NPLs is explained by
interband electronic transitions, which is simulated in the framework of
density functional theory (DFT). The presented simple and effective synthetic
strategy opens a new path to synthesize further NCs with shape and phase
control for advanced applications in electronics and photonics.

assumed to be closed subsets of R^(n+1). In this framework, where the Hausdorff
distance is used to measure the size of perturbations, an explicit formula for

particularly, Lipschitz properties) of linear systems in the Chebyshev

the toroidal mode and its neighbor than the ones with even number of rods. This
increased spectral isolation, along with the low quality factor exhibited by
the toroidal mode, favors the coupling of the commonly silent toroidal dipole

solar radiative zone that have been very difficult to detect at the surface.
Solar g modes would complement solar pressure modes (p modes) in probing the
central regions of the Sun, for example the core rotation rate.
  Aims. A detection of g modes using changes in the large frequency separation
of p modes has recently been reported. However, it is unclear how p and g modes
interact. The aim of this study is to evaluate to what extent g modes can
perturb the frequencies of p modes.
  Methods. We computed the first-order perturbation to global p-mode
frequencies due to a flow field and perturbations to solar structure caused by
a g mode. We focused on long-period g modes and assumed that the g-mode
perturbations are constant in time. The surface amplitude of g modes is assumed
to be $1$ mm s$^{-1}$, which is close to the observational limit.
  Results. Gravity modes do perturb p-mode frequencies to first order if the
harmonic degree of the g mode is even and if its azimuthal order is zero. The
effect is extremely small. For dipole and quadrupole p modes, all frequency
shifts are smaller than $0.1$ nHz, or $2\times10^{-8}$ in relative numbers.
This is because the relative perturbation to solar structure quantities caused
by a g mode of realistic amplitude is of the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$.
We find that structural changes dominate over advection. Surprisingly, the
interaction of g and p modes takes place to a large part near the surface,
where p modes spend most of their propagation times and g modes generate the
largest relative changes to solar structure.
  Conclusions. It appears to be impossible to detect g modes solely through
their signature in p-mode frequency shifts. Whether g modes leave a detectable
signature in p-mode travel times under a given observational setup remains an
open question.

combine the high-accuracy of quantum mechanical simulations with the speed of

potential is the description of local atomic environments by some set of
descriptors. These should ideally be continuous throughout the specified local
atomic environment, twice-differentiable with respect to atomic positions and
complete in the sense of containing all possible information about the
neighborhood. An updated version of the recently proposed Spherical Bessel
descriptors satisfies all three of these properties, and moreover is optimally
complete in the sense of encoding all configurational information with the
smallest possible number of descriptors. The Smooth Overlap of Atomic Position
descriptors that are frequently visited in the literature and the Zernike
descriptors that are built upon a similar basis are included into the
discussion as being the natural counterparts of the Spherical Bessel
descriptors, and shown to be incapable of satisfying the full list of core
requirements for an accurate description. Aside being mathematically and
physically superior, the Spherical Bessel descriptors have also the advantage
of allowing machine learning potentials of comparable accuracy that require
roughly an order of magnitude less computation time per evaluation than the
Smooth Overlap of Atomic Position descriptors, which appear to be the common
choice of descriptors in recent studies.

with a CsI film which also acts as photo-cathode. These detectors have been
successfully in operation at COMPASS since 2016. Concerning bias-voltage
supply, the Thick-GEMs are segmented in order to reduce the energy released in
case of occasional discharges, while the MicroMegas anode is segmented into

In total, there are about ten different electrode types and more than 20000
electrodes supplied by more than 100 HV channels, where appropriate
correlations among the applied voltages are required for the correct operation
of the detectors. Therefore, a robust control system is mandatory, implemented
by a custom designed software package, while commercial power supply units are
used. This sophisticated control system allows to protect the detectors against
errors by the operator, to monitor and log voltages and currents at 1 Hz rate,
and automatically react to detector misbehaviour. In addition, a voltage
compensation system has been developed to automatically adjust the biasing
voltage according to environmental pressure and temperature variations, to
achieve constant gain over time. This development answers to a more general
need. In fact, voltage compensation is always a requirement for the stability
of gaseous detectors and its need is enhanced in multi-layer ones.

some known functors on the usual category of $G$-C*-algebras extend. After
observing that this setup allows a natural notion of (approximate) unitary
equivalence, the main aim of the paper is to generalize the fundamental
intertwining results commonly employed in the Elliott program for classifying

prevalence of certain uniqueness and existence theorems, and may provide a
useful alternative to the Evans--Kishimoto intertwining argument in future

a ring and the balance between the energy input rate provided by a close by
satellite and the internal dissipation rate occurring through ring particle
collisions that is required to maintain ring eccentricity, as derived from the
equations of motion governing the Lagrangian-displacements of the ring-particle

of ring. In the case of the ring system of (10199) Chariklo, where the evidence
that the rings are eccentric is not conclusive, we apply the theory of
apse-alignment to derive information about the most plausible combination of
values of the surface density and eccentricity-gradient, as well as the masses
and locations of their postulated but -presently

applied to the ring system of (10199) Chariklo, we are able to estimate the
minimum mass of a shepherd satellite required to prevent eccentricity decay, as
a function of its orbital location, for two different models of dissipation. We
conclude that the satellite mass required to maintain the m = 1 eccentric mode

the electroproduction of exclusive reactions is an important avenue for

detector in Hall~B has provided the dominant part of the available world data
on most relevant meson electroproduction channels off the nucleon in the
resonance region for $Q^2$ up to 5~GeV$^2$. Analyses of CLAS data for the
exclusive channels $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $\pi^+ \pi^- p$ on a proton target
have provided the only results available on the $Q^2$ evolution of the
electro-excitation amplitudes for the transitions from the initial
photon-proton to the final $N^*$ states in the mass range up to $W$=1.8~GeV.
These electrocouplings allow for exploration of the internal structure of the
produced excited nucleon states. This work has made it clear that consistent
results from independent analyses of several exclusive channels with different
resonance hadronic decay parameters and non-resonant backgrounds but the same
$N^*$ electro-excitation amplitudes, is essential to have confidence in the
extracted results. Starting in early 2018, a program to study the spectrum and
structure of $N^*$ states in various exclusive electroproduction channels using
the new CLAS12 spectrometer commenced. These studies will probe the structure
of $N^*$ states in the mass range up to $W$=3~GeV and for $Q^2$ as low as
0.05~GeV$^2$ and as high as 10-12~GeV$^2$, thus providing a means to access
$N^*$ structure information spanning a broad range of distance scales.
Quasi-real photoproduction studies are also planned to search for additional
$N^*$ states, the so-called hybrid baryons, for which the glue serves as an
active structural component. In this talk the $N^*$ programs from both CLAS and

important to avert disastrous consequences of major disruptions. Predicting

we address this issue for networks with weak individual interactions and
chaotic local dynamics. We do this by building a model network, termed an

a statistical description of their interactions. We illustrate this approach by
reconstructing the dynamics and structure of realistic neuronal interaction

equation of state governing cold supranuclear matter. To date and in the near
future, gravitational wave measurements from neutron star binaries are likely
to be restricted to the inspiral. However, future upgrades and the next
generation of gravitational wave detectors will enable us to detect the
gravitational wave signatures emitted after the merger of two stars, at times
when densities beyond those in single neutron stars are reached. Therefore, the
postmerger gravitational wave signal enables studies of supranuclear matter at
its extreme limit. To support this line of research, we present new and updated
phenomenological relations between the binary properties and characteristic
features of the postmerger evolution. Most notably, we derive an updated
relation connecting the mass-weighted tidal deformability and the maximum
neutron star mass to the dominant emission frequency of the postmerger
spectrum. With the help of a configuration-independent Bayesian analysis using
simplified Lorentzian model functions, we find that the main emission frequency
of the postmerger remnant, for signal-to-noise ratios of $8$ and above, can be
extracted within a 1-sigma uncertainty of about 100 Hz for Advanced LIGO and
Advanced Virgo's design sensitivities. In some cases, even a postmerger
signal-to-noise ratio of $4$ can be sufficient to determine the main emission
frequency. This will enable us to measure binary and equation-of-state
properties from the postmerger, to perform a consistency check between
different parts of the binary neutron star coalescence, and to put our physical
interpretation of neutron star mergers to the test.

independence of elderly people by supporting everyday life activities. To
guarantee a safe and intuitive interaction between human and robot, human
intentions need to be recognized automatically. As humans communicate their
intentions multimodally, the use of multiple modalities for intention
recognition may not just increase the robustness against failure of individual
modalities but especially reduce the uncertainty about the intention to be
predicted. This is desirable as particularly in direct interaction between
robots and potentially vulnerable humans a minimal uncertainty about the
situation as well as knowledge about this actual uncertainty is necessary.
Thus, in contrast to existing methods, in this work a new approach for
multimodal intention recognition is introduced that focuses on uncertainty
reduction through classifier fusion. For the four considered modalities speech,
gestures, gaze directions and scene objects individual intention classifiers
are trained, all of which output a probability distribution over all possible
intentions. By combining these output distributions using the Bayesian method
Independent Opinion Pool the uncertainty about the intention to be recognized
can be decreased. The approach is evaluated in a collaborative human-robot
interaction task with a 7-DoF robot arm. The results show that fused
classifiers which combine multiple modalities outperform the respective
individual base classifiers with respect to increased accuracy, robustness, and
reduced uncertainty.

a problem of fundamental interest to a number of fields in physics, ranging
from condensed matter to cosmology. For unitary systems, tensor network methods
have proved successful and extending these to open systems is a natural avenue
for study. In particular, an important question concerns the possibility of
approximating the critical dynamics of non-equilibrium systems with tensor
networks. Here, we investigate this by performing numerical simulations of a
paradigmatic quantum non-equilibrium system with an absorbing state: the
quantum contact process. We consider the application of matrix product states
and the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to simulate the time-evolution
of the quantum contact process at criticality. In the Lindblad formalism, we
find that the Heisenberg picture can be used to improve the accuracy of
simulations over the Schr\""{o}dinger approach, which can be understood by
considering the evolution of operator-space entanglement. Furthermore, we also
consider a quantum trajectories approach, which we find can reproduce the
expected universal behaviour of key observables for a significantly longer time
than direct simulation of the average state. These improved results provide
further evidence that the universality class of the quantum contact process is
not directed percolation, which is the class of the classical contact process.

where egalitarianism refers to the power of each coin to participate in the

several new cryptocurrencies employ alternative consensus, such as
proof-of-stake in which block minting opportunities are based on monetary

egalitarian by making the rich richer, as opposed to proof-of-work in which
everyone can contribute equally according to their computational power. In this
paper, we give the first quantitative definition of a cryptocurrency's
\emph{egalitarianism}. Based on our definition, we measure the egalitarianism
of popular cryptocurrencies that (may or may not) employ ASIC-resistance, among
them Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. Our simulations show, as
expected, that ASIC-resistance increases a cryptocurrency's egalitarianism. We
also measure the egalitarianism of a stake-based protocol, Ouroboros, and a
hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-work cryptocurrency, Decred. We show that
stake-based cryptocurrencies, under correctly selected parameters, can be
perfectly egalitarian, perhaps contradicting folklore belief.

which usually causes subsampling bias, inflates generalization errors and
jeopardizes the reliability and effectiveness of cross-validation. Based on
ordered systematic sampling theory in statistics and low-discrepancy sequence
theory in number theory, we propose a new k-fold cross-validation procedure by
replacing a pseudo-random sequence with a best-discrepancy sequence, which
ensures low subsampling bias and leads to more precise
Expected-Prediction-Error estimates. Experiments with 156 benchmark datasets
and three classifiers (logistic regression, decision tree and naive bayes) show
that in general, our cross-validation procedure can extrude subsampling bias in
the MCCV by lowering the EPE around 7.18% and the variances around 26.73%. In
comparison, the stratified MCCV can reduce the EPE and variances of the MCCV
around 1.58% and 11.85% respectively. The Leave-One-Out (LOO) can lower the EPE
around 2.50% but its variances are much higher than the any other CV procedure.
The computational time of our cross-validation procedure is just 8.64% of the
MCCV, 8.67% of the stratified MCCV and 16.72% of the LOO. Experiments also show
that our approach is more beneficial for datasets characterized by relatively
small size and large aspect ratio. This makes our approach particularly
pertinent when solving bioscience classification problems. Our proposed
systematic subsampling technique could be generalized to other machine learning
algorithms that involve random subsampling mechanism.

de-facto standard in data privacy, owing to its robust mathematical guarantees,
generalised applicability and rich body of literature. Over the years,
researchers have studied differential privacy and its applicability to an
ever-widening field of topics. Mechanisms have been created to optimise the
process of achieving differential privacy, for various data types and
scenarios. Until this work however, all previous work on differential privacy
has been conducted on a ad-hoc basis, without a single, unifying codebase to
implement results.
  In this work, we present the IBM Differential Privacy Library, a general
purpose, open source library for investigating, experimenting and developing
differential privacy applications in the Python programming language. The
library includes a host of mechanisms, the building blocks of differential
privacy, alongside a number of applications to machine learning and other data
analytics tasks. Simplicity and accessibility has been prioritised in
developing the library, making it suitable to a wide audience of users, from
those using the library for their first investigations in data privacy, to the
privacy experts looking to contribute their own models and mechanisms for
others to use.

cavities have enabled numerous applications from telecommunications to
biodetection. To overcome the intrinsically low Raman gain value of silica,
these devices leverage their ultra-high quality factors (Q), allowing sub-mW
stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) lasing thresholds to be achieved. A closely
related nonlinear behavior to SRS is stimulated anti-Stokes Raman scattering
(SARS). This nonlinear optical process combines the pump photon with the SRS
photon to generate an upconverted photon. Therefore, in order to achieve SARS,
the efficiency of the SRS process must be high. As a result, achieving SARS in
on-chip resonant cavities has been challenging due to the low lasing
efficiencies of these devices. In the present work, metal-doped ultra-high Q
(Q>107) silica microcavity arrays are fabricated on-chip. The metal-dopant
plays multiple roles in improving the device performance. It increases the
Raman gain of the cavity material, and it decreases the optical mode area, thus
increasing the circulating intensity. As a result, these devices have SRS
lasing efficiencies that are over 10x larger than conventional silica
microcavities while maintaining low lasing thresholds. This combination enables
SARS to be generated with sub-mW input powers and significantly improved
anti-Stokes Raman lasing efficiency.

beyond a critical (small) rotation rate is known to cause a sudden enhancement
of heat transfer which can be explained by a change in the character of the BL
dynamics near the top and bottom plates of the convection cell. Namely, with
increasing rotation rate, the BL signature suddenly changes from
Prandtl--Blasius type to Ekman type. The transition from a constant heat
transfer to an almost linearly increasing heat transfer with increasing
rotation rate is known to be sharp and the critical Rossby number $Ro_{c}$
occurs typically in the range $2.3\lesssim Ro_{c}\lesssim 2.9$ (for Rayleigh
number $Ra=1.3\times 10^9$, $Pr=6.7$, and a convection cell with aspect ratio
$\Gamma=\frac{D}{H}=1$, with $D$ the diameter and $H$ the height of the cell).
The explanation of the sharp transition in the heat transfer points to the
change in the dominant flow structure. At $1/Ro\lesssim 1/Ro_c$ (slow
rotation), the well-known LSC is found: a single domain-filling convection roll
made up of many individual thermal plumes. At $1/Ro\gtrsim 1/Ro_c$ (rapid
rotation), the LSC vanishes and is replaced with a collection of swirling
plumes that align with the rotation axis. In this paper, by numerically
studying Lagrangian acceleration statistics, related to the small-scale
properties of the flow structures, we reveal that this transition between these
different dominant flow structures happens at a second critical Rossby number,
$Ro_{c_2}\approx 2.25$ (different from $Ro_{c_1}\approx 2.7$ for the sharp
transition in the Nusselt number $Nu$; both values for the parameter settings
of our present numerical study). When statistical data of Lagrangian tracers
near the top plate are collected, it is found that the root-mean-square (rms)
values and the kurtosis of the horizontal acceleration of these tracers show a
sudden increase at $Ro_{c_2}$.

generating Kerr frequency combs. Whispering gallery mode resonators are
particularly attractive because of their small footprint as well as low
threshold and power consumption. This performance can be attributed to two
characteristics: the cavity quality factor (Q) and the cavity dispersion. The
input optical field into the cavity is amplified by the cavity Q, enabling
nonlinear processes to occur with low input powers. In addition, the total span
of the optical comb is governed by the dispersion. In an optical cavity-based
comb, the dispersion is governed by the geometric dispersion of the cavity and
the material dispersion. While many different materials have been explored, the
realization of ultra-high Q (UHQ) on-chip frequency combs sources is still
challenging for most materials. One exception is the family of integrated
silica devices. However, because the silica attracts water molecules from the
ambient environment, the lifetime of the device performance is fundamentally
limited, unless packaged in a controlled atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate the
generation of environmentally-stable frequency combs fabricated from
SiO1.7N0.13 microtoroidal resonators. Due to the UHQ factors of the cavities,
parametric oscillations with sub-microwatt thresholds are demonstrated. Based
on their geometry and material properties, the cavities have normal dispersion.
However, due to avoided mode crossing, frequency combs are generated. Finally,
unlike SiO2, the SiO1.7N0.13 inhibits the formation of a water monolayer,
allowing sub-microwatt performance to be maintained for over a week in devices
stored with minimal environmental controls.

Naturally in the dark sector one can find dark matter related coupling, and
such coupling may induce dark matter self-scattering. In case that such
scattering is subdominant, the dark matter partition function is not thermal
but determined by the freeze-in process, yet its high momentum side is
generally also Boltzmann suppressed. We show that the matter power spectrum is
very similar to a warm dark matter one in shape. When matched to the current
WDM bound, a $24$~keV freeze-in dark matter is ruled out at $2\sigma$
confidence level. In case that the dark matter self-scattering is strong and
decouples at a very late time, by a new numerical calculation we show that the
early stage Brownian motion indeed protects the power spectrum against
free-streaming suppression. However, such an effect cannot be characterized by
a free-streaming length alone; we find that the self-scattering decoupling time
is another necessary parameter. The currently interested dark matter
self-interaction cross section $\sim\text{cm}^2/\text{g}$ is just marginal for
such protection to be effective.

\apostle $\Lambda$CDM cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. These indicate
that: (i)~the total mass within $3$ Mpc of the Milky Way-Andromeda midpoint
($M_{\rm 3Mpc}$) typically exceeds $\sim 3$ times the sum of the virial masses
($M_{\rm 200crit}$) of the two primaries and (ii)~the dwarf galaxy formation
efficiency per unit mass is uniform throughout the volume. This suggests that
the satellite population within the virial radii of the Milky Way and Andromeda
should make up fewer than one third of all LG dwarfs within $3$ Mpc. This is
consistent with the fraction of observed LG galaxies with stellar mass
$M_*>10^7\,M_{\odot}$ that are satellites ($12$ out of $42$; i.e., $28$ per
cent). For the \apostle galaxy mass-halo mass relation, the total number of
such galaxies further suggests a LG mass of $M_{\rm 3 Mpc}\sim 10^{13} \,
M_{\odot}$. At lower galaxy masses, however, the observed satellite fraction is
substantially higher ($42$ per cent for $M_*>10^5\,M_{\odot}$). If this is due
to incompleteness in the field sample, then $\sim 50$ dwarf galaxies at least
as massive as the Draco dwarf spheroidal must be missing from the current LG
{\it field} dwarf inventory. The incompleteness interpretation is supported by
the pronounced flattening of the LG luminosity function below $M_*\sim 10^7\,
M_{\odot}$, and by the scarcity of low-surface brightness LG field galaxies
compared to satellites. The simulations indicate that most missing dwarfs
should lie near the virial boundaries of the two LG primaries, and predict a
trove of nearby dwarfs that await discovery by upcoming wide-field imaging
surveys.

significance for improving the acceptance of intelligent vehicles. Decomposing
motion into primitives and then accurately and smoothly joining the motion
primitives (MPs) is an essential issue in the motion planning system.
Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to regenerate and join the learned MPs
in the library. By applying a representation algorithm based on the modified
dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) and singular value decomposition (SVD), our
method separates the basic shape parameters and fine-tuning shape parameters
from the same type of demonstration trajectories in the MP library. Moreover,
we convert the MP joining problem into a re-representation problem and use the
characteristics of the proposed representation algorithm to achieve an accurate
and smooth transition. This paper demonstrates that the proposed method can
effectively reduce the number of shape adjustment parameters when the MPs are
regenerated without affecting the accuracy of the representation. Besides, we
also present the ability of the proposed method to smooth the velocity jump
when the MPs are connected and evaluate its effect on the accuracy of tracking
the set target points. The results show that the proposed method can not only
improve the adjustment ability of a single MP in response to different motion
planning requirements but also meet the basic requirements of MP joining in the
generation of MP sequences.

Our equations describe the flows and spatio-temporal defect chaos

mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and combinatorial designs called $k$-nets (and
in particular, between complete collections of MUBs and finite affine - or
equivalently: finite projective - planes). Here we introduce the notion of a
$k$-net over an algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ and thus provide a common framework for
both objects. In the commutative case, we recover (classical) $k$-nets, while
choosing $\mathfrak{A} := M_d(\mathbb C)$ leads to collections of MUBs.
  A common framework allows one to find shared properties and proofs that
""inherently work"" for both objects. As a first example, we derive a certain
rigidity property which was previously shown to hold for $k$-nets that can be
completed to affine planes using a completely different, combinatorial
argument. For $k$-nets that cannot be completed and for MUBs, this result is
new, and, in particular, it implies that the only vectors unbiased to all but
$k \leq \sqrt{d}$ bases of a complete collection of MUBs in $\mathbb C^d$ are
the elements of the remaining $k$ bases (up to phase factors). In general, this
is false when $k$ is just the next integer after $\sqrt{d}$; we present an
example of this in every prime-square dimension, demonstrating that the derived
bound is tight.
  As an application of the rigidity result, we prove that if a large enough
collection of MUBs constructed from a certain type of group representation
(e.g. a construction relying on discrete Weyl operators or generalized Pauli
matrices) can be extended to a complete system, then in fact every basis of the
completion must come from the same representation. In turn, we use this to show
that certain large systems of MUBs cannot be completed.

involves levels in the vt=2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest
continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a
consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1,
suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the
thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive
position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature
or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly
over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0 to 7.2, with the
vt=2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only
the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven

solutions have very steep temporal and spatial gradients. Adaptive moving mesh
methods ($r$-adaptive) attempt to optimise the accuracy obtained using a fixed
number of nodes by moving them to regions of steep solution features. This
approach on its own is however limited if the solution becomes more or less
difficult to resolve over the period of interest. Mesh refinement methods
($h$-adaptive), where the mesh is locally coarsened or refined, is an
alternative adaptive strategy which is popular for time-independent problems.
In this paper, we consider the effectiveness of a combined method

presented indicating excellent solution accuracy compared to other moving mesh
approaches. The method is also shown to control the spatial error based on the
user's input error tolerance. Evidence is also presented indicating

main tool to address this problem. However, such techniques incur extremely
large communication and computation overheads while offering only computational

knowledge, we are the first to exploit this observation to harness multi-server
PIR technology to guarantee an optimal privacy for both SUs and PUs, thanks to
the unique properties of database-driven CRN . We showed, analytically and
empirically with deployments on actual cloud systems, that multi-server PIR is
an ideal tool to provide efficient location privacy in database-driven CRN.

specifically designed for CI users based on CI auditory stimuli. We leverage a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract both stationary and
non-stationary components of environmental acoustics and speech. We propose
three CNN architectures: (1) vanilla CNN that directly generates the enhanced
signal; (2) spectral-subtraction-style CNN (SS-CNN) that first predicts noise
and then generates the enhanced signal by subtracting noise from the noisy
signal; (3) Wiener-style CNN (Wiener-CNN) that generates an optimal mask for
suppressing noise. An important problem of the proposed networks is that they
introduce considerable delays, which limits their real-time application for CI
users. To address this, this study also considers causal variations of these
networks. Our experiments show that the proposed networks (both causal and
non-causal forms) achieve significant improvement over existing baseline
systems. We also found that causal Wiener-CNN outperforms other networks, and
leads to the best overall envelope coefficient measure (ECM). The proposed
algorithms represent a viable option for implementation on the CCi-MOBILE
research platform as a pre-processor for CI users in naturalistic environments.

exciting task, due to the lack of stationarity of the environment, whose
dynamics evolves as the population learns. In order to design scalable
algorithms for systems with a large population of interacting agents (e.g.
swarms), this paper focuses on Mean Field MAS, where the number of agents is
asymptotically infinite. Recently, a very active burgeoning field studies the
effects of diverse reinforcement learning algorithms for agents with no prior
information on a stationary Mean Field Game (MFG) and learn their policy
through repeated experience. We adopt a high perspective on this problem and
analyze in full generality the convergence of a fictitious iterative scheme
using any single agent learning algorithm at each step. We quantify the quality
of the computed approximate Nash equilibrium, in terms of the accumulated
errors arising at each learning iteration step. Notably, we show for the first
time convergence of model free learning algorithms towards non-stationary MFG
equilibria, relying only on classical assumptions on the MFG dynamics. We
illustrate our theoretical results with a numerical experiment in a continuous
action-space environment, where the approximate best response of the iterative
fictitious play scheme is computed with a deep RL algorithm.

outperforms other sequence labelling models, achieving the average F1-score of

adversely affected the population of several wild animals. This loss of habitat
has skewed the population of several non-human primate species like chimpanzees

settlements, often leading to human-wildlife conflicts while competing for
resources. For effective wildlife conservation and conflict management, regular
monitoring of population and of conflicted regions is necessary. However,
existing approaches like field visits for data collection and manual analysis
by experts is resource intensive, tedious and time consuming, thus
necessitating an automated, non-invasive, more efficient alternative like image
based facial recognition. The challenge in individual identification arises due
to unrelated factors like pose, lighting variations and occlusions due to the
uncontrolled environments, that is further exacerbated by limited training
data. Inspired by human perception, we propose to learn representations that
are robust to such nuisance factors and capture the notion of similarity over
the individual identity sub-manifolds. The proposed approach, Primate Face
Identification (PFID), achieves this by training the network to distinguish
between positive and negative pairs of images. The PFID loss augments the
standard cross entropy loss with a pairwise loss to learn more discriminative
and generalizable features, thus making it appropriate for other related
identification tasks like open-set, closed set and verification. We report
state-of-the-art accuracy on facial recognition of two primate species, rhesus
macaques and chimpanzees under the four protocols of classification,

diagnosis and treatment options. Advances of Deep learning makes it ideal to

generative models with representation learning properties provides an
alternative path to further understand cancer tissue phenotypes, capturing
tissue morphologies. In this paper, we develop a framework which allows GANs to
capture key tissue features and uses these characteristics to give structure to
its latent space. To this end, we trained our model on two different datasets,
an H&E colorectal cancer tissue from the National Center for Tumor diseases
(NCT) and an H&E breast cancer tissue from the Netherlands Cancer Institute
(NKI) and Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). Composed of 86 slide images and 576

FID of 16.65 (breast cancer) and 32.05 (colorectal cancer). We further assess
the quality of the images with cancer tissue characteristics (e.g. count of
cancer, lymphocytes, or stromal cells), using quantitative information to
calculate the FID and showing consistent performance of 9.86. Additionally, the
latent space of our model shows an interpretable structure and allows semantic
vector operations that translate into tissue feature transformations.
Furthermore, ratings from two expert pathologists found no significant

setup is similar to the photon counter based on the ""cold electron bolometer""
(CEB), where the JJ replaces the CEB in the center of the superconducting
antenna. In the second setup, the JJ is capacitively coupled to the antenna. We
derive the Hamiltonians for the two setups and we write the Schr\""odinger
equations taking into account both, the antenna and the JJ. The quantum
particles of the MQT models are in two-dimensional potential landscapes, which
are parabolic along one direction and may have the form of a washboard
potential along another direction. Such a potential landscape has a series of
local minima, separated by saddle points. If the particle is prepared in the
initial state in the metastable ""ground state"" of a local minimum, then the
photon absorption causes it to jump into an excited state. If the excitation
energy is bigger than the potential barrier seen by the quantum particle (the
difference between the ""ground state"" and the saddle point), the photon is
detected.
  The models are simple and allow us to do mostly analytical calculations. We
show that the two setups are equivalent form the MQT point of view, since one
Hamiltonian can be transformed into the other by changes of variables. For
typical values of the JJ and antenna parameters, the setups may work as
counters of photons of wavelengths up to 1 cm, at least.

effect appears as a result of only temperature and shape difference, hence it
is called thermoshape effect. For GaAs quantum confined semiconductor
nanostructures, we first introduce the existence of quantum shape effects on
thermoelectric transport coefficients at ballistic regime. We show that the
shape alone enters as a control parameter on transport properties of confined
nanostructures. The thermoshape voltage is then calculated by using the
Landauer formalism. Our calculations show that the thermoshape voltage has a
constant value in the order of mV/K for the variation of chemical potential in
non-degenerate regime and it decreases rapidly after entering weakly degenerate
regime where it oscillates around zero within plus/minus 10$\mu$V/K magnitude.
A persistent voltage range may pave the way for easier experimental
demonstration of the effect. Our work explicitly shows how important the effect
of overall geometry is in nanoscale thermoelectric materials, and can be
utilized even if all sizes are the same. A thermoshape junction not only
represents a viable setup for the macroscopic manifestation of quantum shape
effects, but also constitutes their first possible device application.

realise such an ambitious mission in the coming decades. In 2019, the European
Space Agency released a call for scientific themes for its strategic science
planning process for the 2030s and 2040s, known as Voyage 2050. We used this

systems, producing a revised and updated set of scientific questions and
motivations for their exploration. This review article describes how such a
mission could explore their origins, ice-rich interiors, dynamic atmospheres,
unique magnetospheres, and myriad icy satellites, to address questions at the
heart of modern planetary science. These two worlds are superb examples of how
planets with shared origins can exhibit remarkably different evolutionary
paths: Neptune as the archetype for Ice Giants, whereas Uranus may be atypical.
Exploring Uranus' natural satellites and Neptune's captured moon Triton could
reveal how Ocean Worlds form and remain active, redefining the extent of the
habitable zone in our Solar System. For these reasons and more, we advocate
that an Ice Giant System explorer should become a strategic cornerstone mission

detection algorithms directly can lead to an over-segmented image. To address
this problem, we start by splitting the image into small regions using an
initial segmentation. The obtained regions are used for building the complex
network. To produce meaningful connected components and detect homogeneous
communities, some combinations of color and texture based features are employed
in order to quantify the regions similarities. To sum up, the network of
regions is constructed adaptively to avoid many small regions in the image, and
then, community detection algorithms are applied on the resulting adaptive
similarity matrix to obtain the final segmented image. Experiments are
conducted on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and four of the most influential
community detection algorithms are tested. Experimental results have shown that
the proposed general framework increases the segmentation performances compared

demonstrations, reducing the power consumption and enabling the use of high
power-handling switches. Furthermore, the MEMS resonators greatly reduce the
required inductance value, guaranteeing much smaller form factor compared to
the previous LC demonstrations. The demonstrated circulator shows broad BW (15
dB-IX BW=34.7 MHz for an operational frequency around 2.5 GHz), low IL (4 dB),
high IX (30 dB), high linearity (P1dB=28 dBm; IIP3=40 dBm) and at the same time
low power consumption, addressing several of the current limitations hindering
the full development of magnet-free circulators.

arrays of subwavelength cross-shaped apertures in metallic screens. The aim was
to determine the most appropriate fabrication technique to be used considering
the cost, ease of fabrication and accuracy in which the apertures were created.
Some interesting physical effects are observed.
