reconstructed using a jet with $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 200$ GeV, found with the
anti-$k_{t}$ $R = 1.0$ jet algorithm, and groomed to remove soft and wide-angle
radiation and to mitigate contributions from the underlying event and
additional proton-proton collisions. Two different but related measurements are
performed using two jet grooming definitions for reconstructing the
$Z\rightarrow b\overline{b}$ decay: trimming and soft drop. These algorithms
differ in their experimental and phenomenological implications regarding jet
mass reconstruction and theoretical precision. To identify $Z$ bosons,
$b$-tagged $R = 0.2$ track-jets matched to the groomed large-$R$ calorimeter

fits of background templates extracted from the data to the different jet mass
distributions for the two grooming methods. Integrated fiducial cross-sections

leading-order theoretical predictions. The results are found to be in good

correspond to identical observational units. A series of recent works have
studied scenarios in which this assumption is violated under terms such as
``Unlabeled Sensing and ``Regression with Unknown Permutation''. In this paper,
we study the setup of multiple response variables and a notion of mismatches
that generalizes permutations in order to allow for missing matches as well as
for one-to-many matches. A two-stage method is proposed under the assumption
that most pairs are correctly matched. In the first stage, the regression
parameter is estimated by handling mismatches as contaminations, and
subsequently the generalized permutation is estimated by a basic variant of
matching. The approach is both computationally convenient and equipped with
favorable statistical guarantees. Specifically, it is shown that the conditions
for permutation recovery become considerably less stringent as the number of
responses $m$ per observation increase. Particularly, for $m = \Omega(\log n)$,
the required signal-to-noise ratio no longer depends on the sample size $n$.

the temporal evolution of the power method applied to an initial random vector

strong forms of regularity, we extend their approach to graphs containing a
hidden $k$ partition and characterized by a milder form of volume-regularity.
We show that the class of $k$-volume-regular graphs is the largest class of
undirected (possibly weighted) graphs whose transition matrix admits $k$
""stepwise"" eigenvectors (i.e., vectors that are constant over each set of the

volume regularity and lumpability of Markov chains. Moreover, we prove that if
the stepwise eigenvectors are those associated to the first $k$ eigenvalues and
the gap between the $k$-th and the ($k$+1)-th eigenvalues is sufficiently
large, the averaging dynamics of Becchetti et al. recovers the underlying
community structure of the graph in logarithmic time, with high probability.

classic Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators; for $d=3$, it has been proposed
to describe the orientation dynamics of swarms of drones or other entities
moving about in three-dimensional space. Here we use group theory to explain
the recent discovery that the model shows low-dimensional dynamics for all $N
\ge 3$, and to clarify why it admits the analog of the Ott-Antonsen ansatz in
the continuum limit $N \rightarrow \infty$. The underlying reason is that the
system is intimately connected to the natural hyperbolic geometry on the unit
ball $B^d$. In this geometry, the isometries form a Lie group consisting of
higher-dimensional generalizations of the M\""obius transformations used in
complex analysis. Once these connections are realized, the reduced dynamics and
the generalized Ott-Antonsen ansatz follow immediately. This framework also
reveals the seamless connection between the finite and infinite-$N$ cases.

of information explosion and numerous data mining techniques to explore the
information inside large volumes of data. In this context, a new distributed
learning paradigm termed federated learning becomes prominent recently to
tackle the privacy issues in distributed learning, where only learning models
will be transmitted from the distributed nodes to servers without revealing
users' own data and hence protecting the privacy of users.
  In this paper, we propose a horizontal federated XGBoost algorithm to solve
the federated anomaly detection problem, where the anomaly detection aims to
identify abnormalities from extremely unbalanced datasets and can be considered
as a special classification problem. Our proposed federated XGBoost algorithm
incorporates data aggregation and sparse federated update processes to balance
the tradeoff between privacy and learning performance. In particular, we
introduce the virtual data sample by aggregating a group of users' data
together at a single distributed node. We compute parameters based on these
virtual data samples in the local nodes and aggregate the learning model in the
central server. In the learning model upgrading process, we focus more on the
wrongly classified data before in the virtual sample and hence to generate
sparse learning model parameters. By carefully controlling the size of these
groups of samples, we can achieve a tradeoff between privacy and learning
performance. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed

empirical study of security smells in Ansible and Chef scripts. Methodology: We
conduct a replication study where we apply qualitative analysis with 1,956 IaC
scripts to identify security smells for IaC scripts written in two languages:
Ansible and Chef. We construct a static analysis tool called Security Linter
for Ansible and Chef scripts (SLAC) to automatically identify security smells

occurrences of security smells that include 7,849 hard-coded passwords. We
observe agreement for 65 of the responded 94 bug reports, which suggests the

conductive needles (with up to a few ten um radius and a height of 100 um),

beautifully on standard benchmarks but fail to generalize outside the lab. This

synthesize strikingly realistic and diverse images. Is generative modeling of

visual manifold. In particular, we study their ability to fit simple
transformations such as camera movements and color changes. We find that the
models reflect the biases of the datasets on which they are trained (e.g.,
centered objects), but that they also exhibit some capacity for generalization:
by ""steering"" in latent space, we can shift the distribution while still
creating realistic images. We hypothesize that the degree of distributional
shift is related to the breadth of the training data distribution. Thus, we
conduct experiments to quantify the limits of GAN transformations and introduce

in the nearby NGC 3109 dwarf association. The color-magnitude diagram shows
both a prominent old, metal-poor stellar component and confirms a small
population of young, blue stars with ages $\lesssim 1$ Gyr. We use the
color-magnitude diagram fitting algorithm MATCH to derive the star formation
history and find that it is consistent with the typical dwarf irregular or
transitional dwarf galaxy (dTrans) in the Local Group. Antlia B shows
relatively constant stellar mass growth for the first $\sim 10-11$ Gyr and
almost no growth in the last $\sim 2-3$ Gyr. Despite being gas-rich, Antlia B
shows no evidence of active star formation (i.e., no H$\alpha$ emission) and
should therefore be classified as a dTrans dwarf. Both Antlia B and the Antlia
dwarf (dTrans) are likely satellites of NGC 3109 suggesting that the cessation
of ongoing star formation in these galaxies may be environmentally driven.
Future work studying the gas kinematics and distribution in Antlia B will
explore this scenario in greater detail. Our work highlights the fact that
detailed studies of nearby dwarf galaxies in a variety of environments may

guarantees quantum integrability. We revisit the question of whether
classically-conserved local higher-spin currents in two-dimensional sigma
models survive quantization. We define an integrability index $\mathcal{I}(J)$
for each spin $J$, with the property that $\mathcal{I}(J)$ is a lower bound on
the number of quantum conserved currents of spin $J$. In particular, a positive
value for the index establishes the existence of quantum conserved currents.
For a general coset model, with or without extra discrete symmetries, we derive
an explicit formula for a generating function that encodes the indices for all
spins. We apply our techniques to the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model, the $O(N)$
model, and the flag sigma model $\frac{U(N)}{U(1)^{N}}$. For the $O(N)$ model,
we establish the existence of a spin-6 quantum conserved current, in addition
to the well-known spin-4 current. The indices for the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model
for $N>2$ are all non-positive, consistent with the fact that these models are
not integrable. The indices for the flag sigma model $\frac{U(N)}{U(1)^{N}}$

integrable.

new decay modes of heavy Higgs bosons are: $H\to t_4 t \to Wbt, Zt t, ht t$ and
$H\to b_4 b \to Wtb, Zb b, hb b$, where $t_4$ ($b_4$) is the new up-type

they provide the best opportunities for the simultaneous discovery of a new

[OIII]5007/Hb vs. [SII]6717,6731/Ha, i.e., the ""[SII] BPT diagram,"" to gain
insight into the physical properties of high-redshift star-forming regions.
High-redshift MOSDEF galaxies are offset towards lower [SII]6717,6731/Ha at
fixed [OIII]5007/Hb, relative to local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). Furthermore, at fixed [OIII]5007/Hb, local SDSS galaxies follow
a trend of decreasing [SII]6717,6731/Ha as the surface density of star
formation (Sigma_SFR) increases. We explain this trend in terms of the
decreasing fractional contribution from diffuse ionized gas (f_DIG) as
Sigma_SFR increases in galaxies, which causes galaxy-integrated line ratios to
shift towards the locus of pure HII-region emission. The z~0 relationship
between f_DIG and Sigma_SFR implies that high-redshift galaxies have lower
f_DIG values than typical local systems, given their significantly higher
typical Sigma_SFR. When an appropriate low-redshift benchmark with zero or
minimal f_DIG is used, high-redshift MOSDEF galaxies appear offset towards
higher [SII]6717,6731/Ha and/or [OIII]5007/Hb. The joint shifts of
high-redshift galaxies in the [SII] and [NII] BPT diagrams are best explained
in terms of the harder spectra ionizing their star-forming regions at fixed
nebular oxygen abundance (expected for chemically-young galaxies), as opposed
to large variations in N/O ratios or higher ionization parameters. The evolving
mixture of HII regions and DIG is an essential ingredient to our description of
the ISM over cosmic time.

may provide the first indication that such an event occurred in the Milky Way.
We identify about 500 stars that have coherent radial and prograde motion in
this stream using a catalog of accreted stars built by applying deep learning
methods to the second Gaia data release. Nyx is concentrated within $\pm 2$ kpc
of the Galactic midplane and spans the full radial range studied (6.5-9.5 kpc).
The kinematics of Nyx stars are distinct from those of both the thin and thick
disk. In particular, its rotational speed lags the disk by $\sim 80$ km/s and
its stars follow more eccentric orbits. A small number of Nyx stars have
chemical abundances or inferred ages; from these, we deduce that Nyx stars have
a peak metallicity of [Fe/H] $\sim -0.5$ and ages $\sim $10-13 Gyr. Taken
together with the kinematic observations, these results strongly favor the
interpretation that Nyx is the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. To further
justify this interpretation, we explicitly demonstrate that metal-rich,
prograde streams like Nyx can be found in the disk plane of Milky Way-like
galaxies using the FIRE hydrodynamic simulations. Future spectroscopic studies
will be able to validate whether Nyx stars originate from a single progenitor.

73\% of neutrinos would come from CC SNe at redshifts $z > 0.3$, and (2) a
large field of view (FoV), since typical IceCube muon neutrino pointing
accuracy is on the order of $\sim1$~deg. With Blanco/DECam ($gri$ to 24th
magnitude and $2.2$~deg diameter FoV), we performed a triggered optical
follow-up observation of two IceCube alerts, IC170922A and IC171106A on
$\sim6$~nights during the $\sim3$~weeks following each alert. For the IC170922A
(IC171106A) follow-up observations, we expect that 12.1\% (9.5\%) of coincident
CC SNe at $z \lesssim 0.3$ are detectable, and that on average, 0.23 (0.07)
unassociated SNe in the neutrino 90\% containment regions also pass our
selection criteria. We find two candidate CC SNe that are temporally coincident
with the neutrino alerts in the FoV, but none in the 90\% containment regions,
which is statistically consistent with expected rates of background CC SNe for
these observations. If CC SNe are the dominant source of TeV-PeV neutrinos, we
would expect an excess of coincident CC SNe to be detectable at the $3\sigma$
confidence level using DECam observations similar to those of this work for
$\sim60$ ($\sim200$) neutrino alerts with (without) redshift information for
all candidates.

behavior at low temperatures, metallic temperature dependent resistivity is
observed for the high pressure phase, as, surprisingly, are two resistivity

important role in their thermal and magnetic evolution, hence in setting their
observational properties. One way to study the crust properties is to measure
how it cools after it has been heated during an accretion outburst in a
low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Such studies have shown that there is a
tantalizing source of heat, of currently unknown origin, that is located in the
outer layers of the crust and has a strength that varies between different
sources and different outbursts. With the aim of understanding the mechanism
behind this ""shallow heating"", we present Chandra and Swift observations of the
neutron star LMXB Aql X-1, obtained after its bright 2016 outburst. We find
that the neutron star temperature was initially much lower, and started to
decrease at much later time, than observed after the 2013 outburst of the
source, despite the fact that the properties of the two outbursts were very
similar. Comparing our data to thermal evolution simulations, we infer that the
depth and magnitude of shallow heating must have been much larger during the
2016 outburst than during the 2013 one. This implies that basic neutron star
parameters that do not change between outbursts, do not play a strong role in
shallow heating. Furthermore, it suggests that outbursts with a similar
accretion morphology can give rise to very different shallow heating. We also
discuss alternative explanations for the difference in quiescent evolution
after the 2016 outburst.

adopts a generalized array manifold separation approach via Jacobi-Anger
approximation, which transforms a non-ideal, non-uniform array manifold into a
virtual array domain with a desired uniform geometric structure to facilitate
super-resolution angle estimation and channel acquisition. Accordingly,
structure-based optimization techniques are developed to effectively estimate
both the channel covariance and the instantaneous channel state information
(CSI) within a short sensing time. In particular, the difference in
time-variation of channel path angles and path gains is capitalized to design a
two-step CSI estimation scheme that can quickly sense fading channels.
Theoretical results are provided on the fundamental limits of the proposed
technique in terms of sample efficiency. For computational efficiency, a fast
iterative algorithm is developed via the alternating direction method of
multipliers. Other related issues such as spurious-peak cancellation in
nonuniform linear arrays and extensions to higher-dimensional cases are also
discussed. Simulations testify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in

being the dominant volatile as opposed to H$_2$O and one of the largest
N$_2$/CO ratios ever observed in a comet. Using observations obtained with the
\textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}, NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, the
3.5-meter ARC telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the Discovery Channel
Telescope at Lowell Observatory, and the Arizona Radio Observatory 10-m
Submillimeter Telescope we quantified the abundances of 12 different species in
the coma of R2 PanSTARRS. We confirm the high abundances of CO and N$_2$ and
heavy depletions of H$_2$O, HCN, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO compared to CO reported
by previous studies. We provide the first measurements (or most sensitive
measurements/constraints) on H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, OCS,
C$_2$H$_2$, and NH$_3$, all of which are depleted relative to CO by at least
one to two orders of magnitude compared to values commonly observed in comets.
The observed species also show strong enhancements relative to H$_2$O, and even
when compared to other species like CH$_4$ or CH$_3$OH most species show
deviations from typical comets by at least a factor of two to three. The only
mixing ratios found to be close to typical are CH$_3$OH/CO$_2$ and
CH$_3$OH/CH$_4$. While R2 PanSTARRS was located at a heliocentric distance of
2.8 AU at the time of our observations in January/February 2018, we argue that
this alone cannot account for the peculiar observed composition of this comet
and therefore must reflect its intrinsic composition. We discuss possible
implications for this clear outlier in compositional studies of comets obtained
to date, and encourage future dynamical and chemical modeling in order to
better understand what the composition of R2 PanSTARRS tells us about the early
Solar System.

positive measure set of isotropic m-planes, the intersection of the images of
$A$ and $B$ under orthogonal projections onto these planes have positive
Hausdorff $m$-measure. In addition, if $A$ is a measurable set of Hausdorff
dimension greater than $m$, then there is a set $B\subset\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with
$\dim B\leq m$ such that for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^{2n}\setminus B$ there is a
positive measure set of isotropic m-planes for which the translate by $x$ of
the orthogonal complement of each such plane, intersects $A$ on a set of
dimension $\dim A-m$. These results are then applied to obtain analogous
results on the $n^{th}$ Heisenberg group.

simulation community due to their success in solving complex flow dynamics.
There is an increasing need to analyze the data produced as output by these
simulations. Simultaneously, topological analysis tools are emerging as
powerful methods for investigating simulation data. However, most of the
current approaches to topological analysis have had limited application to
HO-FEM simulation data for two reasons. First, the current topological tools
are designed for linear data (polynomial degree one), but the polynomial degree
of the data output by these simulations is typically higher (routinely up to
polynomial degree six). Second, the simulation data and derived quantities of
the simulation data have discontinuities at element boundaries, and these
discontinuities do not match the input requirements for the topological tools.
One solution to both issues is to transform the high-order data to achieve
low-order, continuous inputs for topological analysis. Nevertheless, there has
been little work evaluating the possible transformation choices and their
downstream effect on the topological analysis. We perform an empirical study to
evaluate two commonly used data transformation methodologies along with the
recently introduced L-SIAC filter for processing high-order simulation data.

applications in machine learning, game theory, social networks, and facility

functions. That is, given a partial function consisting of a family of subsets
of $[m]$ and a value at each point, does there exist a coverage function
defined on all subsets of $[m]$ that extends this partial function? Partial
function extension is previously studied for other function classes, including
boolean functions and convex functions, and is useful in many fields, such as
obtaining bounds on learning these function classes.
  We show that determining extendibility of a partial function to a coverage
function is NP-complete, establishing in the process that there is a
polynomial-sized certificate of extendibility. The hardness also gives us a
lower bound for learning coverage functions. We then study two natural notions
of approximate extension, to account for errors in the data set. The two
notions correspond roughly to multiplicative point-wise approximation and
additive $L_1$ approximation. We show upper and lower bounds for both notions
of approximation. In the second case we obtain nearly tight bounds.

high-precision photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), ii)

foreground stars and background galaxies. Our spectroscopic analysis shows that
one known member star is likely a binary, and challenges the membership status
of three others, including two distant candidates that had formerly provided
evidence for overall stellar mass loss. We also find evidence that the proposed
kinematic gradient across Leo V might be due to small number statistics. We
update the systemic proper motion of Leo V, finding $(\mu_\alpha \cos\delta,
\mu_\delta)= (0.009\pm0.560$, $-0.777\pm0.314)$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which is
consistent with its reported orbit that did not put Leo V at risk of being
disturbed by the Milky Way. These findings remove most of the observational

member stars, two of which are located >5 half-light radii from the main body.
These stars require further investigation. Therefore, the nature of Leo V still

affected community. Such posts can be relevant and may contain valuable
situational awareness information. However, the information overload of social
media challenges the timely processing and extraction of relevant information
by the emergency services. Furthermore, the growing usage of multimedia content
in the social media posts in recent years further adds to the challenge in
timely mining relevant information from social media. In this paper, we present
a novel method for multimodal relevancy classification of social media posts,
where relevancy is defined with respect to the information needs of emergency
management agencies. Specifically, we experiment with the combination of
semantic textual features with the image features to efficiently classify a
relevant multimodal social media post. We validate our method using an
evaluation of classifying the data from three real-world crisis events. Our
experiments demonstrate that features based on the proposed hybrid framework of
exploiting both textual and image content improve the performance of
identifying relevant posts. In the light of these experiments, the application
of the proposed classification method could reduce cognitive load on emergency
services, in filtering multimodal public posts at large scale.

Learning to Rank (LTR): Counterfactual LTR and Online LTR. There has long been
an interest in LTR from user interactions, however, this form of implicit
feedback is very biased. In recent years, unbiased LTR methods have been
introduced to remove the effect of different types of bias caused by
user-behavior in search. For instance, a well addressed type of bias is
position bias: the rank at which a document is displayed heavily affects the
interactions it receives. Counterfactual LTR methods deal with such types of
bias by learning from historical interactions while correcting for the effect
of the explicitly modelled biases. Online LTR does not use an explicit user
model, in contrast, it learns through an interactive process where randomized
results are displayed to the user. Through randomization the effect of
different types of bias can be removed from the learning process. Though both
methodologies lead to unbiased LTR, their approaches differ considerably,
furthermore, so do their theoretical guarantees, empirical results, effects on
the user experience during learning, and applicability. Consequently, for
practitioners the choice between the two is very substantial. By providing an
overview of both approaches and contrasting them, we aim to provide an
essential guide to unbiased LTR so as to aid in understanding and choosing
between methodologies.

ionized-gas disks smoothly coupled with their outer HI disks, 7 galaxies reveal
circumnuclear polar ionized-gas disks, and in NGC 2551 the ionized gas though
confined to the main galactic plane however counterrotates the stellar
component. The ionized-gas excitation analysis reveals the gas ionization by
young stars in 12 of 18 S0 galaxies studied here; the current star formation in
these galaxies is confined to the ring-like zones coinciding with the UV-rings.
The gas oxygen abundance estimates in the rings are closely concentrated around
the value of 0.7 $Z_\odot$ and do not correlate either with the ring radius nor
with the metallicity of the underlying stellar population. By applying the
tilted-ring analysis to the 2D velocity fields of the ionized gas, we have
traced the orientation of the gas rotation-plane lines of nodes along the
radius. We have found that current star formation proceeds usually just where
the gas lies strictly in the stellar disk planes and rotates there circularly;
the sense of the gas rotation does not matter (the counterrotating gas in NGC
2551 form stars currently). In the galaxies without signs of current star
formation the extended gaseous disks are either in steady-state quasi-polar
orientation (NGC 2655, NGC 2787, NGC 3414, UGC 9519), or are acquired recently
through the highly inclined external filaments provoking probably shock-like
excitation (NGC 4026, NGC 7280). Our data imply crucial difference of the
external-gas accretion regime in S0s with respect to spiral galaxies: the
geometry of the gas accretion in S0s is typically off-plane.

kind of atomic motion. In this paper, motion of 111Cd tracer probe atoms is
reconsidered following electron-capture decay of 111In in the series of In3R
phases (R= rare-earth). The motion produces nuclear relaxation that was
measured using the method of perturbed angular correlation. Previous
measurements along the entire series of In3R phases appeared to show a
crossover between two diffusional regimes. While relaxation for R= Lu-Tb is
consistent with a simple vacancy diffusion mechanism, relaxation for R= Nd-La
is not. More recent measurements in Pd3R phases demonstrate that the
site-preference of the parent In-probe changes along the series and suggests
that the same behavior occurs for daughter Cd-probes. The anomalous motion
observed for R= Nd-La is attributed to ""lanthanide expansion"" occurring towards
La end-member phases. For In3La, the Cd-tracer is found to jump away from its
original location on the In-sublattice in an extremely short time, of order 0.5
ns at 1000 K and 1.2 ms at room temperature, a residence time too short to be
consistent with defect-mediated diffusion. Several scenarios that can explain
the relaxation are presented based on the hypothesis that daughter Cd-probes
first jump to neighboring interstitial sites and then are either trapped and
immobilized, undergo long-range diffusion, or persist in a localized motion in

results for sending Gaussian bivariate sources over binary additive-noise TWCs

developing useful machine-learning applications, their wider adoption has been
hindered by the lack of strong assurance guarantees that can be made about
their behavior. In this paper, we consider how formal verification techniques
developed for traditional software systems can be repurposed for verification
of reinforcement learning-enabled ones, a particularly important class of
machine learning systems. Rather than enforcing safety by examining and
altering the structure of a complex neural network implementation, our
technique uses blackbox methods to synthesizes deterministic programs, simpler,
more interpretable, approximations of the network that can nonetheless
guarantee desired safety properties are preserved, even when the network is
deployed in unanticipated or previously unobserved environments. Our
methodology frames the problem of neural network verification in terms of a
counterexample and syntax-guided inductive synthesis procedure over these
programs. The synthesis procedure searches for both a deterministic program and
an inductive invariant over an infinite state transition system that represents
a specification of an application's control logic. Additional specifications
defining environment-based constraints can also be provided to further refine
the search space. Synthesized programs deployed in conjunction with a neural
network implementation dynamically enforce safety conditions by monitoring and
preventing potentially unsafe actions proposed by neural policies. Experimental
results over a wide range of cyber-physical applications demonstrate that
software-inspired formal verification techniques can be used to realize
trustworthy reinforcement learning systems with low overhead.

contents of an aerial image and triggers several related studies over the last
years. However, most of them deploy few efforts in exploiting label relations,
while such dependencies are crucial for making accurate predictions. Although
an LSTM layer can be introduced to modeling such label dependencies in a chain
propagation manner, the efficiency might be questioned when certain labels are
improperly inferred. To address this, we propose a novel aerial image
multi-label classification network, attention-aware label relational reasoning
network. Particularly, our network consists of three elemental modules: 1) a
label-wise feature parcel learning module, 2) an attentional region extraction
module, and 3) a label relational inference module. To be more specific, the
label-wise feature parcel learning module is designed for extracting high-level
label-specific features. The attentional region extraction module aims at
localizing discriminative regions in these features and yielding attentional
label-specific features. The label relational inference module finally predicts
label existences using label relations reasoned from outputs of the previous
module. The proposed network is characterized by its capacities of extracting
discriminative label-wise features in a proposal-free way and reasoning about
label relations naturally and interpretably. In our experiments, we evaluate
the proposed model on the UCM multi-label dataset and a newly produced dataset,
AID multi-label dataset. Quantitative and qualitative results on these two
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. To facilitate progress in
the multi-label aerial image classification, the AID multi-label dataset will
be made publicly available.

disk of HD 169142. We report new ALMA observations at 3 mm and analyze them
together with archival 0.89 and 1.3 mm data. Our observations resolve three out
of the four rings in the disk previously seen in high-resolution ALMA data. A
simple parametric model is used to estimate the radial profile of the dust
optical depth, temperature, density, and particle size distribution. We find
that the multiple ring features of the disk are produced by annular
accumulations of large particles, probably associated with gas pressure bumps.
Our model indicates that the maximum dust grain size in the rings is $\sim1$
cm, with slightly flatter power-law size distributions than the ISM-like size
distribution ($p\sim3.5$) found in the gaps. In particular, the inner ring
($\sim26$ au) is associated with a strong and narrow buildup of dust particles
that could harbor the necessary conditions to trigger the streaming
instability. According to our analysis, the snowlines of the most important
volatiles do not coincide with the observed substructures. We explore different
ring formation mechanisms and find that planet-disk interactions are the most
likely scenario to explain the main features of HD 169142. Overall, our
multi-wavelength analysis provides some of the first unambiguous evidence of
the presence of radial dust traps in the rings of HD 169142. A similar analysis

irradiated by a laser beam. The two-dimensional atomic force microscope (AFM)
line scanning of the deformation of the GO film after switching off the laser

model used by Brevik is not applicable. The rough estimates of the kinetic

kinetic energy of atoms is confused with their rest energy. The atoms and their
masses are displaced forward by the field and their displaced rest energies
give rise to an energy flux. The difference of arguments between ours and
Brevik's culminates on the question whether the flux of rest energy caused by
the displacement of the medium moving with light should be included in the
total energy flux. We also show that the four-divergence of the

track provides us with an opportunity to design efficient logging and querying
system for cross-site genomic dataset access audit. We designed a
blockchain-based log system which can provide a light-weight and widely
compatible module for existing blockchain platforms. The submitted solution won
the third place of the competition. In this paper, we report the technical
details in our system. Methods: We present two methods: baseline method and

implementation based on the competition evaluation criteria and characteristics
of the log system. To overcome obstacles of indexing on the immutable
Blockchain system, we designed a hierarchical timestamp structure which
supports efficient range queries on the timestamp field. Results: We
implemented our methods in Python3, tested the scalability, and compared the
performance using the test data supplied by competition organizer. We
successfully boosted the log retrieval speed for complex AND queries that
contain multiple predicates. For the range query, we boosted the speed for at
least one order of magnitude. The storage usage is reduced by 25%. Conclusion:
We demonstrate that Blockchain can be used to build a time and space efficient

solution for sharing genomic data with accountability requirement across

characterized by two distinctive components: fast intrachain, and slow
interchain. At room temperature the interchain diffusion coefficients are found
to be $D_a=0.89\cdot10^{-2}$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$ and $D_b=1.49\cdot10^{-2}$

exceptionally high exciton mobility along the $\pi$-conjugated backbone
facilitates rapid triplet migration over long distances. Our results can be

  Constraints","52 pages, 11 figures",,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Under ""measurement constraints,"" responses are expensive to measure and
initially unavailable on most of records in the dataset, but the covariates are
available for the entire dataset. Our goal is to sample a relatively small
portion of the dataset where the expensive responses will be measured and the
resultant sampling estimator is statistically efficient. Measurement
constraints require the sampling probabilities can only depend on a very small
set of the responses. A sampling procedure that uses responses at most only on
a small pilot sample will be called ""response-free."" We propose a response-free
sampling procedure \mbox{(OSUMC)} for generalized linear models (GLMs). Using
the A-optimality criterion, i.e., the trace of the asymptotic variance, the
resultant estimator is statistically efficient within a class of sampling
estimators. We establish the unconditional asymptotic distribution of a general
class of response-free sampling estimators. This result is novel compared with
the existing conditional results obtained by conditioning on both covariates
and responses. Under our unconditional framework, the subsamples are no longer
independent and new martingale techniques are developed for our asymptotic
theory. We further derive the A-optimal response-free sampling distribution.
Since this distribution depends on population level quantities, we propose the
Optimal Sampling Under Measurement Constraints (OSUMC) algorithm to approximate
the theoretical optimal sampling. Finally, we conduct an intensive empirical
study to demonstrate the advantages of OSUMC algorithm over existing methods in
both statistical and computational perspectives.

bubble-like components simultaneously, and therefore we call it a twin CME.
Detailed imaging and kinematic analysis results indicate that the twin CME were
evolved form the eruption of a mini-filament driven blowout jet at the east
edge of an equatorial coronal hole, in which the activation of the
mini-filament was tightly associated with the continuous flux cancellation and
quasi-periodic jet-like activities in the filament channel. Due to the magnetic
reconnection between the filament and the ambient open field lines, the
filament broke partially at the northern part and resulted in an intriguing
blowout jet in the south direction. It is interesting that the ejecting jet was
deflected by a group of remote open field lines, which resulted in the
significant direction change of the jet from southward to eastward. Based on
the close temporal and spatial relationships among the jet, filament eruption,
and the twin CME, we conclude that the jet-like CME should be the coronal
extension of the jet plasma, while the bubble-like one should be originated
from the eruption of the mini-filament confined by the closed magnetic fields
at the jet-base.

and positive force amplification to assist the user's finger movement. To
evaluate the effects of different control parameters on neuromuscular re-sponse

controlled by a proportional derivative controller that computes the motor
torque to follow a desired joint angle of the index part, which is obtained
from inverse kinematics of a virtual end-effector mass driven by the finger

by the user's closing and opening finger motion, with different proportional

goal is to train an animal detector that can be re-used for repeated
acquisitions, e.g. in follow-up years. Domain shifts between datasets typically
prevent such a direct model application. We thus propose to bridge this gap

Optimal Transport to find corresponding regions between the source and the
target datasets in the space of CNN activations. The CNN scores in the source

animals, and this ranking is transferred to the target dataset. Unlike
conventional AL criteria that exploit model uncertainty, TS focuses on very
confident samples, thus allowing a quick retrieval of true positives in the
target dataset, where positives are typically extremely rare and difficult to
find by visual inspection. We extend TS with a new window cropping strategy
that further accelerates sample retrieval. Our experiments show that with both
strategies combined, less than half a percent of oracle-provided labels are
enough to find almost 80% of the animals in challenging sets of UAV images,

polyhedral (piecewise-linear convex) surrogate losses. Given any polyhedral
loss $L$, we give a construction of a link function through which $L$ is a

construct a consistent polyhedral surrogate for any given discrete loss. Our
framework yields succinct proofs of consistency or inconsistency of various

sphere, plays a key role in its applications to astrophysics. For instance, an
unstable photon sphere is responsible for determining the size of a black hole
shadow, while a stable photon sphere is inferred to cause the instability of
spacetime due to the trapping of gravitational waves on the radius. A photon
surface is a geometrical structure first introduced by Claudel, Virbhadra and
Ellis as the generalization of a photon sphere. The surface does not require
any symmetry of spacetime and has its second fundamental form pure-trace. In
this paper, we define the stability of null geodesics on a photon surface. It
represents whether null geodesics perturbed from the photon surface are
attracted to or repelled from the photon surface. Then, we define a strictly
(un)stable photon surface as a photon surface on which all null geodesics are
(un)stable. We find that the stability is determined by Riemann curvature.
Furthermore, it is characterized by the normal derivative of the second
fundamental form. As a consequence, for example, a strictly unstable photon
surface requires nonvanishing Weyl curvature on it if the null energy condition
is satisfied.

unknown compact object and a massive companion O star. It shows rather stable
emissions at high energies over years and hence serves as an ideal laboratory
to investigate the emission mechanism for such peculiar systems which emit
prominent $\gamma$-rays. To this end, we take the orbital phase resolved energy
spectrum as observed by \fermi over 10 years. We divide the orbit into four
orbital phases, each with an orbital phase range of 0.25, centered at 0.00,
0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 respectively, where the phase 0.0 is the periastron and
phase 0.5 is the apastron. The phases around 0.25 and 0.75 are symmetric and
hence are supposed to have identical local acceleration environment. The
spectral analysis shows that, the \fermi spectra are largely different from
these two symmetric orbital phases: the emission from orbital phase 0.25 turns
out to be significantly stronger than that from 0.75. This result does not fit
a scenario that $\gamma$-rays are Doppler boosted emission from bow shock tails
if LS 5039 has a shock configuration similar to PSR B1259-63, and indicates
that the inverse Compton scatterings between the shock accelerated plasma and
the stellar particle environment is the underline procedure. We also find that
the previous report for a disappearance of the orbital modulation at 3--20 GeV
is due to the similar spectral turn-over energies of the different orbital
phases. The spectral properties of periastron and apastron regions are
addressed in the context of the measurements in phase regions around 0.25 and

spectra can contribute to our understanding of the Galactic chemical evolution,
providing chemical abundances belonging to the different nucleosynthesis

have been proven to be excellent indicators of stellar ages. We aim at
providing an empirical relationship between stellar ages and [C/N] using, as
calibrators, open star clusters observed by both the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE
surveys. We use stellar parameters and abundances from the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE
of the Galactic field and open cluster stars. Ages of star clusters are
retrieved from the literature sources and validated using a common set of
isochrones. We use the same isochrones to determine, for each age and
metallicity, the surface gravity at which the first dredge-up and red giant
branch bump occur. We study the effect of extra-mixing processes in our sample
of giant stars, and we derive the mean [C/N] in evolved stars, including only
stars without evidence of extra-mixing. Combining the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE
samples of open clusters, we derive a linear relationship between [C/N] and
logarithmic cluster ages. We apply our relationship to selected giant field
stars in both Gaia-ESO and APOGEE. We find an age separation between thin and
thick disc stars and age trends within their populations, with an increasing
age towards lower metallicity populations. With such empirical relationship, we
are able to provide an age estimate for giant stars in which C and N abundances
are measured. Isochrone fitting is less sensitive for giant than dwarf stars at
the turn off. The present method can be thus considered as an additional tool
to give an independent estimate of the age of giant stars, with uncertainties
in their ages comparable to those obtained using isochrone fitting for dwarf
stars.

advantageous to avoid extremely high energy configurations while also retaining
the ability to quickly generate new and independent trial states. Thus, we
introduce a continuous normalizing flow method which can quickly generate
independent states for various proposal distributions using a first-order
differential equation. We define this continuous normalizing molecular flow
approach based on two-body intermolecular interactions to achieve a probability
distribution transformation method which yields distributions which have
probability densities of zero when molecule pairs are in close proximity; while
in all other cases, the probability density is compressed such that it is
spatial uniform. This transform provides the proposal distribution which
generates no states of extremely high energy. We find that an inverse square
flow is applicable as the continuous normalizing molecular flow. Using the
transformed distribution, we can perform the Metropolis-Hastings method more
efficiently. The high efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using

neighbor identification. Inspired by recent progress in compressive sensing,
this paper proposes a new sparse regression scheme for SSC via two-step
reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization, which also generalizes a two-step
$\ell_1$-minimization algorithm introduced by E. J. Cand\`es et al in [The
Annals of Statistics, vol. 42, no. 2, pp. 669-699, 2014] without incurring
extra algorithmic complexity. To fully exploit the prior information offered by
the computed sparse representation vector in the first step, our approach
places a weight on each component of the regression vector, and solves a
weighted LASSO in the second step. We propose a data weighting rule suitable
for enhancing neighbor identification accuracy. Then, under the formulation of
the dual problem of weighted LASSO, we study in depth the theoretical neighbor
recovery rates of the proposed scheme. Specifically, an interesting connection
between the locations of nonzeros of the optimal sparse solution to the
weighted LASSO and the indexes of the active constraints of the dual problem is
established. Afterwards, under the semi-random model, analytic probability
lower/upper bounds for various neighbor recovery events are derived. Our
analytic results confirm that, with the aid of data weighting and if the prior
neighbor information is enough accurate, the proposed scheme with a higher
probability can produce many correct neighbors and few incorrect neighbors as
compared to the solution without data weighting. Computer simulations are
provided to validate our analytic study and evidence the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

as it inspired Shor to discover the celebrated quantum algorithm solving
integer factorization in polynomial time. Besides, the quantum algorithm for
Simon's problem has been recently applied to break symmetric cryptosystems.
Generalized Simon's problem, denoted by $\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$, is a natural
extension of Simon's problem. In this paper we consider the query complexity of
$\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$. First, it is not difficult to design a quantum algorithm
solving the above problem with query complexity of $O(n-k)$. However, so far it
is not clear what is the classical query complexity of the problem, and
revealing this complexity is necessary for clarifying the computational power
gap between quantum and classical computing on the problem.
  To tackle this problem, we prove that any classical (deterministic or
randomized) algorithm for $\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$ has to query at least
$\Omega\left(\max\{k, \sqrt{p^{n-k}}\}\right)$ values and any classical
nonadaptive deterministic algorithm for $\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$ has to query at
least $\Omega\left(\max\{k, \sqrt{k \cdot p^{n-k}}\}\right)$ values. Hence, we
clearly show the classical computing model is less powerful than the quantum
counterpart, in terms of query complexity for the generalized Simon's problem.
Moreover, we obtain an upper bound $O\left(\max\{k, \sqrt{k \cdot
p^{n-k}}\}\right)$ on the classical deterministic query complexity of
$\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$, by devising a subtle classical algorithm based on group
theory and the divide-and-conquer approach. Therefore, we have an almost full
characterization of the classical deterministic query complexity of the
generalized Simon's problem.

the objects in the category may be realised as sub-objects -- via morphisms in

properties. In the category of separable Banach spaces with morphisms
consisting of linear isometries, such an example of (a universal) object is
provided by the well-known Banach Mazur theorem: the space C[0,1] of continuous
functions on the unit interval contains each separable Banach spaces as a
closed subspace via a linear isometry. Here the question also arises if, as
opposed to realising (separable) Banach spaces as spaces of continuous
functions on [0, 1], it is possible to embed a Banach space as a subgroup of
the group of linear isometries (resp. unitaries) on a nice Banach (resp.
Hilbert) space. If such is the case, one says that the given Banach space is
representable as a group of isometries (resp. unitaries).
  On the other hand, the idea of embeddability involves the possibility of
realising each object in a given class of objects as included inside another
object of the same class enjoying some good properties which are not present in
the initial object. Further, considering that a Banach space also comes
equipped with weaker structures involving the underlying metric (Lipschitz),
uniform and topological structures, it follows that besides the linear
isomorphisms (isometries), one may also consider morphisms in this category
consisting of maps which are Lipschitz, uniformly continuous or continuous.
This motivates the consideration of situations where it becomes necessary to
know if a Banach space (resp a metric space) may be embedded in a nice Banach

demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to
natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning. Along
with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and
disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus
transparency, for example the medical sector. Explanations for machine
decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This
requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the
mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the
deep learning is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly
understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different
research works and categorize them. The different categories show different
dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide
""obviously"" interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By
applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is
hoped that (1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these
methods with caution, (2) insights into interpretability will be born with more
considerations for medical practices, and (3) initiatives to push forward
data-based, mathematically- and technically-grounded medical education are
encouraged.

that inferring the missing parts of the networks by performing network

the recovery of missing nodes and edges in such incomplete networks is an
insufficiently explored problem due to the modeling difficulty, which is much
more challenging than link prediction that only infers missing edges. In this
paper, we present DeepNC, a novel method for inferring the missing parts of a

first learns a likelihood over edges via an autoregressive generative model,
and then identifies the graph that maximizes the learned likelihood conditioned
on the observable graph topology. Moreover, we propose a computationally
efficient DeepNC algorithm that consecutively finds individual nodes that
maximize the probability in each node generation step, as well as an enhanced
version using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The runtime complexities
of both algorithms are shown to be almost linear in the number of nodes in the
network. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of DeepNC over
state-of-the-art network completion approaches.

popularity as an alternative of random matrices as they provide guarantees for
recovery of sparse signals. In particular, the construction of binary matrices
has attained significance due to their potential for hardware-friendly
implementation and appealing applications. Our present work aims at
constructing incoherent binary matrices consisting of orthogonal blocks with
small block coherence. We show that the binary matrices constructed from Euler
squares exhibit block orthogonality and possess low block coherence. With a
goal of obtaining better aspect ratios, the present work generalizes the notion
of Euler Squares and obtains a new class of deterministic binary matrices of
more general size. For realizing the stated objectives, to begin with, the
paper revisits the connection of finite field theory to Euler Squares and their
construction. Using the stated connection, the work proposes Generalized Euler
Squares (GES) and then presents a construction procedure. Binary matrices with
low coherence and general row-sizes are obtained, whose column size is in the
maximum possible order. Finally, the paper shows that the special structure
possessed by GES is helpful in resulting in block orthogonal structure with
small block coherence, which supports the recovery of block sparse signals.

scale-free networks. Here, we introduce three types of operations, i.e., type-A
operation, type-B operation and type-C operation, for generating random
scale-free networks $N(p,q,r,t)$. On the basis of our operations, we put
forward the concrete process of producing networks, which constitute the
network space $\mathcal{N}(p,q,r,t)$, and then discuss their topological
properties. Firstly, we calculate the range of the average degree of each
member in our network space and discover that each member is a sparse network.
Secondly, we prove that each member in our space obeys the power-law
distribution with degree exponent $\gamma=1+\frac{\ln(4-r)}{\ln2}$, which
implies that each member is scale-free. Next, we analyze the diameter, and find
that the diameter may abruptly transform from small to large due to type-B
operation. Afterwards, we study the clustering coefficient of network and
discover that its value is only determined by type-C operation. Ultimately, we
make an elaborate conclusion. \\ \textbf{Keywords:} Random network; degree

sticky boundaries and boundary diffusion have a 'smoothing' effect on
pedestrian motion. When these effects are active, the pedestrian paths are
semimartingales with first-variation part absolutely continuous with respect to

general induces a measure singular with respect to $dt$) as is the case under
Neumann boundary conditions. We show that the proposed mean-field model for
pedestrian motion admits a unique weak solution and that it is possible to
control the system in the weak sense, using a Pontryagin-type maximum
principle. We also relate the mean-field type control problem to the social

nonempty sets. We call a (simple, finite) graph G = (V, E) a $Z$-containment
graph provided one can assign to each vertex $v_i \in V $ a set $S_i \in Z$
such that $v_i v_j \in E$ if and only if $S_i \subset S_j$ or $S_j \subset S_i$
. Similarly, we call a (strict) partially ordered set $P = (V, <)$ a
$Z$-containment poset if to each $v_i \in V $ we can assign a set $S_i \in Z$
such that $v_i < v_j$ if and only if $S_i \subset S_j$. Obviously, $G$ is the
comparability graph of $P$.
  We give some basic results on containment graphs and investigate the
containment graphs of iso-oriented boxes in $d$-space. We present a
characterization of those classes of posets and graphs that have containment
representations by sets of a specific type, and we extend our results to
``injective'' containment classes. After that we discuss similar
characterizations for intersection, overlap, and disjointedness classes of
graphs. Finally, in the last section we discuss the nonexistence of a
characterization theorem for ``strong'' containment classes of graphs.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) illuminated by a two-spot laser beam. This
laser beam introduces spin-orbit (SO) coupling in the BECs such that the SO
coupling produces an effect similar to a linear doublewell potential (DWP). It
is well known that symmetry breaking in a DWP is an important effect and has
been discussed in many kinds of systems. However, it has not yet been discussed
in a DWP formed by SO coupling. The objective of this work is to study the
symmetry breaking of spinor BECs trapped by a DWP formed by SO coupling. We
find that two kinds of symmetry breaking, displacement symmetry breaking and
bimodal symmetry breaking, can be obtained in this model. The influence of the
symmetry transition is systematically discussed by controlling the interaction
strength of the BECs and the distance between the center of the two spots.
Moreover, because SO coupling violates Galilean invariance, the influence of
symmetry breaking in the moving system is also addressed in this paper.

tidal coherences measured along different eigenvector directions. The mean
virial-to-accretion mass ratios of the subhalos are used to quantify the
severity of their mass-loss evolutions within the hosts, and the tidal
coherence is expressed as an array of three numbers each of which quantifies
the alignment between the tidal fields smoothed on the scales of $2$ and
$30\,h^{-1}$Mpc in each direction of three principal axes. Using a Rockstar
halo catalog retrieved from a N-body simulation, we investigate if and how the
mass-loss evolutions of the subhalos hosted by distinct halos at fixed mass
scale of [$1$-$3$]$10^{14}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ are correlated with three
components of the tidal coherence. The tides coherent along different
eigenvector directions are found to have different effects on the subhalo
mass-loss evolution, which cannot be ascribed to the differences in the
densities and ellipticities of the local environments. It is shown that the
substructures surrounded by the tides highly coherent along the first
eigenvector direction and highly {\it incoherent} along the third eigenvector
direction experience the least severe mass-loss evolution, while the tides
highly {\it incoherent} only along the first eigenvector direction is
responsible for the most severe mass-loss evolution of the subhalos. Explaining
that the coherent tides have an obstructing effect on the satellite infalls
onto their hosts and that the strength of the obstruction effect depends on
which directions the tides are coherent or {\it incoherent} along, we suggest
that the multidimensional dependence of the substructure evolution on the tidal
coherence should be deeply related to the complex nature of the large-scale

services for high speed trains has become one of the most urgent challenges.
With vast amounts of spectrum available, the millimeter wave (mmWave) system is
able to provide transmission rates of several gigabits per second for high
speed trains. At the same time, mmWave communication also suffers from high
attenuation, thus higher energy efficiency should be considered. This paper
proposes an energy efficient power control scheme of train-ground mmWave
communication for high speed trains. Considering a beam switching method for
efficient beam alignment, we first establish position prediction model, the
realistic direction antenna model and receive power model. And then we allocate
the transmission power rationally through the power minimization algorithm
while ensuring the total amount of transmission data. Based on this, this paper
also develops a hybrid optimization scheme and finds the limit of total energy
consumption when the number of segments goes to infinity. Through simulation
with various system parameters and taking velocity estimation error into

non-affine displacements may be computed within a harmonic theory. We show that
for compact crystals, such as the square and triangular in $d=2$ and the
simple, body-centered and face-centered cubic crystals in $d=3$, a single set
of $d-$fold degenerate modes always dominate the non-affine sub-space and are
separated from the rest by a large gap. These modes may be identified with
specific precursor configurations that lead to lattice defects. Deformation
mechanisms such as lattice slips and stacking faults in close packed crystals
can also be understood within this framework. The qualitative features of these
conclusions are expected to be independent of the details of the atomic
interactions.

scenarios. Its reaction rate must be accurately known in the present era of
high precision astrophysics. The cross section of the reaction is often
measured relative to a low energy resonance, the strength of which must
therefore be determined precisely. The activation method, based on the
measurement of 15O decay, has not been used in modern measurements of the
14N(p,gamma)15O reaction. The aim of the present work is to provide strength
data for two resonances in the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction using the activation
method. The obtained values are largely independent from previous data measured
by in-beam gamma-spectroscopy and are free from some of their systematic
uncertainties. Solid state TiN targets were irradiated with a proton beam
provided by the Tandetron accelerator of Atomki using a cyclic activation. The
decay of the produced 15O isotopes was measured by detecting the 511 keV
positron annihilation gamma-rays. The strength of the Ep = 278 keV resonance
was measured to be 13.4 +- 0.8 meV while for the Ep = 1058 keV resonance the
strength is 442 +- 27 meV. The obtained Ep = 278 keV resonance strength is in
fair agreement with the values recommended by two recent works. On the other
hand, the Ep = 1058 keV resonance strength is about 20% higher than the
previous value. The discrepancy may be caused in part by a previously neglected
finite target thickness correction. As only the low energy resonance is used as
a normalization point for cross section measurements, the calculated
astrophysical reaction rate of the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction and therefore the
astrophysical consequences are not changed by the present results.

Cauchy mentions variable quantities, limits, and infinitesimals, but the
meaning he attached to these terms is not identical to their modern meaning.
  Some Cauchy historians work in a conceptual scheme dominated by an assumption
of a teleological nature of the evolution of real analysis toward a preordained
outcome. Thus, Gilain and Siegmund-Schultze assume that references to limite in
Cauchy's work necessarily imply that Cauchy was working with an Archi-medean
continuum, whereas infinitesimals were merely a convenient figure of speech,
for which Cauchy had in mind a complete justification in terms of Archimedean
limits. However, there is another formalisation of Cauchy's procedures
exploiting his limite, more consistent with Cauchy's ubiquitous use of
infinitesimals, in terms of the standard part principle of modern infinitesimal
analysis.
  We challenge a misconception according to which Cauchy was allegedly forced
to teach infinitesimals at the Ecole Polytechnique. We show that the debate
there concerned mainly the issue of rigor, a separate one from infinitesimals.
A critique of Cauchy's approach by his contemporary de Prony sheds light on the
meaning of rigor to Cauchy and his contemporaries. An attentive reading of
Cauchy's work challenges received views on Cauchy's role in the history of
analysis, and indicates that he was a pioneer of infinitesimal techniques as
much as a harbinger of the Epsilontik.

vehicular systems and connected vehicles are prone to different cybersecurity
attacks that endanger passengers' safety. Cyber security in intelligent
connected vehicles is composed of in-vehicle security and security of
inter-vehicle communications. Security of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and
the Control Area Network (CAN) bus are the most significant parts of in-vehicle
security. Besides, with the development of 4G LTE and 5G remote communication
technologies for vehicle-toeverything (V2X) communications, the security of
inter-vehicle communications is another potential problem. After giving a short
introduction to the architecture of next-generation vehicles including
driverless and intelligent vehicles, this review paper identifies a few major
security attacks on the intelligent connected vehicles. Based on these attacks,
we provide a comprehensive survey of available defences against these attacks
and classify them into four categories, i.e. cryptography, network security,
software vulnerability detection, and malware detection. We also explore the
future directions for preventing attacks on intelligent vehicle systems.

the flare spectrum evolves from optically thick to optically thin, under the
assumption that this is due to decreasing optical depth to synchrotron self
absorption. We are able to place upper and lower limits on the size of the
emitting region associated with a radio flare, and determine the synchrotron
source magnetic field and energy as a function of size. The energy has a clear
minimum which occurs close to the condition that the magnetic field derived
from synchrotron self absorption equals that calculated from equipartition.
This minimum energy estimate is independent of the rise time of the event, and
so may be applied to any event for which the peak flux is measured and there is
evidence for self-absorption. This is a much more accurate approach to minimum
energy estimation than assuming expansion at close to the speed of light. We
apply this method to four examples of optically thick radio flares and find
that in each case either the filling factor of the synchrotron source is
considerably less than unity, or the expansion speed is considerably less than
the speed of light. The combination of unity filling factor and expansion
speeds close to the speed of light is completely ruled out on energetic grounds
for three of the four events we consider. The inferred slowed expansion is
consistent with detailed modelling of such events which has been recently
reported in the literature. The minimum power requirements associated with the
flares are found to be ~ 1e36 erg/s, which are easily accomodated in the
context of stellar mass black hole accretion at near-Eddington levels, when
these flares typically occur. However, the true jet power could still be orders
of magnitude higher.

raising a false alarm. Recent research has shown that the use of machine
learning for the fusion of multiple statistical algorithms improves outbreak
detection. Instead of relying only on the binary output (alarm or no alarm) of
the statistical algorithms, we propose to make use of their p-values for
training a fusion classifier. In addition, we also show that adding additional
features and adapting the labeling of an epidemic period may further improve
performance. For comparison and evaluation, a new measure is introduced which
captures the performance of an outbreak detection method with respect to a low
rate of false alarms more precisely than previous works. Our results on
synthetic data show that it is challenging to improve the performance with a
trainable fusion method based on machine learning. In particular, the use of a
fusion classifier that is only based on binary outputs of the statistical
surveillance methods can make the overall performance worse than directly using
the underlying algorithms. However, the use of p-values and additional
information for the learning is promising, enabling to identify more valuable
patterns to detect outbreaks.

control on the front pressure through a first microphone located at the front
face of the loudspeaker, and a nonlinear feedback on the membrane displacement
estimated through the measurement of the pressure inside the back cavity with a
second microphone located in the enclosure. It is experimentally shown that
even at a weak excitation level, it is possible to observe and control the
nonlinear behaviour of the system. Taking the cubic nonlinearity as an example,
we demonstrate numerically and experimentally that in the low frequency range
([50 Hz, 500 Hz]), the nonlinear control law allows improving the sound
absorption performance, i.e. enlarging the bandwidth of optimal sound
absorption while increasing the maximal absorption coefficient value, and
producing only a negligible amount of nonlinear distortion. The reported
experimental methodology can be extended to implement various types of hybrid
linear and/or nonlinear controls, thus opening new avenues for managing wave
nonlinearity and achieving non-trivial wave phenomena.

modality-specific properties, they ignore the potential values of
modality-shared cues as well as instance-aware information, which are crucial
for effective fusion of different modalities in RGBT tracking. In this paper,
we propose a novel Multi-Adapter convolutional Network (MANet) to jointly
perform modality-shared, modality-specific and instance-aware feature learning

kinds of adapters within our network. In a specific, the generality adapter is
to extract shared object representations, the modality adapter aims at encoding
modality-specific information to deploy their complementary advantages, and the
instance adapter is to model the appearance properties and temporal variations
of a certain object. Moreover, to reduce computational complexity for real-time
demand of visual tracking, we design a parallel structure of generic adapter

reconstruction-based detectors operate on the measured sensor data, leveraging
physical process models learned a priori.
  In this work, we investigate different approaches to evade prior-work
reconstruction-based anomaly detectors by manipulating sensor data so that the
attack is concealed. We find that replay attacks (commonly assumed to be very
strong) show bad performance (i.e., increasing the number of alarms) if the
attacker is constrained to manipulate less than 95% of all features in the
system, as hidden correlations between the features are not replicated well. To
address this, we propose two novel attacks that manipulate a subset of the
sensor readings, leveraging learned physical constraints of the system. Our
attacks feature two different attacker models: A white box attacker, which uses
an optimization approach with a detection oracle, and a black box attacker,
which uses an autoencoder to translate anomalous data into normal data. We
evaluate our implementation on two different datasets from the water
distribution domain, showing that the detector's Recall drops from 0.68 to 0.12

our black box attacks are transferable to different detectors: They work

manner: if it starts with a relatively small value of charge-to-mass ratio Q/M,
then said value will temporarily increase along its evolutionary path, before
finally decreases towards zero. This contrasts with highly charged ones that
simply radiate away its charge steadily. The combination of these two effects
is the cosmic censor at work: there exists an attractor that flows towards the
Schwazschild limit, which ensures that extremality -- and hence naked
singularity -- can never be reached under Hawking evaporation. We apply the
scheme of Hiscock and Weems to model the evaporation of an asymptotically flat
dilatonic charge black hole known as the Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS)
black hole. We found that upholding the cosmic censorship requires us to modify
the charged particle production rate, which remarkably agrees with the
expression obtained independently via direct computation of charged particle
production rate on curved spacetime background. This not only strengthens the
case for cosmic censorship, but also provides an example in which cosmic
censorship can be a useful principle to deduce other physics. We also found
that the attractor behavior is not necessarily related to the specific heat,

alternative model, the expected loss model, has countercyclical
characteristics, acting as a buffer against economic imbalances caused by
expansionary or contractionary phases in the economy. In Brazil, a mixed

accounting models in relation to the business cycle, using an econometric model
consisting of financial and macroeconomic variables. The study allowed us to
identify the impact of credit risk behavior, earnings management, capital
management, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) behavior, and the behavior of the
unemployment rate on provisions in countries that use different accounting
models. Data from commercial banks in the United Kingdom (incurred loss), in
Spain (expected loss), and in Brazil (mixed model) were used, covering the
period from 2001 to 2012. Despite the accounting models of the three countries
being formed by very different rules regarding possible effects on the business
cycles, the results revealed a pro-cyclical behavior of provisions in each
country, indicating that when GDP grows, provisions tend to fall and vice
versa. The results also revealed other factors influencing the behavior of loan
loss provisions, such as earning management.

of energy harvesting (EH) with promising applications in supplying low-power
remote sensors. Besides the development of individual EH devices, further
issues are posed when considering multiple objects for realizing arrays of
devices and magnifying the extracted power. Due to nonlinear mutual
interactions, the resulting dynamics is generally different from that of single
devices and the setup optimisation turns out to be nontrivial. In this work, we
investigate the problem focusing on a flutter-based EH system consisting of a
rigid plate anchored by elastic elements and invested by a uniform laminar
flow, undergoing regular limit-cycle oscillations and flapping motions of
finite amplitude. We consider a simplified, yet general, physical model and
employ three-dimensional direct numerical simulations based on a
finite-difference Navier-Stokes solver combined with a moving-least-squares
immersed boundary method. Focusing on main kinematic and performance-related
quantities, we first report on the dynamics of the single device and then on
multiple devices. A parametric exploration is performed by varying the mutual
distance between the devices. For the in-line arrangement, a recovery in
performance for downstream devices is achieved by tuning their elasticity.
Moreover, cooperative effects in the side-by-side arrangement are found to be
substantially beneficial in terms of resulting power, with increases (i.e.
constructive interference) up to 100% with respect to the single-device
configuration. In order to confirm this numerical evidence, complementary
results from wind-tunnel experiments are presented. Finally, we describe the
system behaviour when increasing further the number of devices, outlining the
ultimate goal of developing a high-performance EH network of numerous
aeroelastic energy harvesters.

GPS, Bluetooth or Wifi detectors bring additional information, that is, for a
fraction of the users, the origin, the destination and to some extend the

the estimation of a more comprehensive traffic representation tool: the
link-origin-destination matrix. Such three-dimensional matrices extend the
concept of traditional origin-destination matrices by also giving information
on the traffic assignment. Their estimation is solved as an inverse problem
whose objective function represents a trade-off between important properties
the traffic has to satisfy. This article presents the theory and how to
implement such method on real dataset. With the case study of Brisbane City

linear regression via the sorted l1 penalty: the larger the rank of the fitted
coefficient, the larger the penalty. This non-separable penalty renders many
existing techniques invalid or inconclusive in analyzing the SLOPE solution. In
this paper, we develop an asymptotically exact characterization of the SLOPE
solution under Gaussian random designs through solving the SLOPE problem using
approximate message passing (AMP). This algorithmic approach allows us to
approximate the SLOPE solution via the much more amenable AMP iterates.
Explicitly, we characterize the asymptotic dynamics of the AMP iterates relying
on a recently developed state evolution analysis for non-separable penalties,
thereby overcoming the difficulty caused by the sorted l1 penalty. Moreover, we
prove that the AMP iterates converge to the SLOPE solution in an asymptotic
sense, and numerical simulations show that the convergence is surprisingly
fast. Our proof rests on a novel technique that specifically leverages the
SLOPE problem. In contrast to prior literature, our work not only yields an
asymptotically sharp analysis but also offers an algorithmic, flexible, and
constructive approach to understanding the SLOPE problem.

of natural radioactivity in the detector materials. These simulations indicate

segregation model where two types of agents are placed on a grid and an agent

simply swap their location with a randomly chosen other discontent agent or
jump to a random empty cell.
  We analyze a generalized game-theoretic model of Schelling segregation which

the residential area. For this we show that both aspects heavily influence the
dynamic properties and the tractability of finding an optimal placement. We map
the boundary of when improving response dynamics (IRD), i.e., the natural

we prove several sharp threshold results where guaranteed IRD convergence
suddenly turns into the strongest possible non-convergence result: a violation
of weak acyclicity. In particular, we show such threshold results also for
Schelling's original model, which is in contrast to the standard assumption in
many empirical papers. Furthermore, we show that in case of convergence, IRD
find an equilibrium in $\mathcal{O}(m)$ steps, where $m$ is the number of edges

cellular and molecular biology. While the overwhelming majority of studies have
focused on the time it takes a given single Brownian searcher to reach a
target, cellular processes are instead often triggered by the arrival of the
first molecule out of many molecules. In these scenarios, the more relevant
timescale is the FPT of the first Brownian searcher to reach a target from a
large group of independent and identical Brownian searchers. Though the
searchers are identically distributed, one searcher will reach the target
before the others and will thus have the fastest FPT. This fastest FPT depends
on extremely rare events and its mean can be orders of magnitude faster than
the mean FPT of a given single searcher. In this paper, we use rigorous
probabilistic methods to study this fastest FPT. We determine the asymptotic
behavior of all the moments of this fastest FPT in the limit of many searchers
in a general class of two- and three-dimensional domains. We establish these
results by proving that the fastest searcher takes an almost direct path to the

possibilities, since for each event depth can be readily estimated; however, to
fully exploit asynchronous nature of the sensor and avoid fixed time interval
event accumulation, stereo event lifetime estimation should be employed. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for event lifetime estimation of stereo
event-cameras, allowing generation of sharp gradient images of events that
serve as input to disparity estimation methods. Since a single brightness
change triggers events in both event-camera sensors, we propose a method for
single shot event lifetime and disparity estimation, with association via

stereo matched. Results are validated on real-world data through multiple

extreme values for certain subgroups $\alpha$ $\subset$ {1,. .. , d} of

of a novel mixture model that permits to describe the distribution of extremal

variable. One may then take advantage of the model by assigning to any extreme
point a posterior probability for each anomaly type $\alpha$, defining
implicitly a similarity measure between anomalies. It is explained at length

e.g. generating two random binary bit streams with tunable amount of
correlation between the corresponding bits in the two streams. Electronic
implementation of such a system would call for several components leaving a
large footprint on a chip and dissipating excessive amount of energy. Here, we
show an elegant implementation with just two dipole-coupled magneto-tunneling
junctions (MTJ), with magnetostrictive soft layers, fabricated on a
piezoelectric film. The resistance states of the two MTJs (high or low) encode
the bits in the two streams. The first MTJ is driven to a random resistance
state via a current or voltage generating spin transfer torque and/or voltage
controlled magnetic anisotropy, while the second MTJ's resistance state is
determined solely by dipole coupling with the first. The effect of dipole
coupling can be varied with local strain applied to the second MTJ with a local
voltage (~0.2 V) and that varies the correlation between the resistance states

electron production via magnetic reconnection in macroscale systems. The model
is based on the discovery that the production of energetic electrons during
reconnection is controlled by Fermi reflection in large-scale magnetic fields
and not by parallel electric fields localized in kinetic scale boundary layers.
Thus, the model eliminates these boundary layers. However, although the
parallel electric fields that develop around the magnetic x-line and associated
separatrices are not important in producing energetic electrons, there is a
large scale electric field that kickstarts the heating of low-energy electrons
and drives the cold-electron return current that accompanies escaping energetic
electrons in open systems. This macroscale electric field is produced by
magnetic-field-aligned gradients in the electron pressure. We have upgraded
kglobal to include this large-scale electric field while maintaining energy
conservation. The new model is tested by exploring the dynamics of electron
acoustic modes which develop as a consequence of the presence of two electron
species: hot kinetic and cold fluid electrons. Remarkably, the damping of
electron acoustic modes is accurately captured by kglobal. Additionally, it has
been established that kglobal correctly describes the dynamics of the
interaction of the parallel electric field with escaping hot electrons through
benchmarking simulations with the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code p3d.

observes the control policy before choosing an attack strategy. We investigate
two problems. In the first problem, we synthesize a robust control policy for
the stochastic game that maximizes the probability of satisfying the LTL
constraint. A value iteration based algorithm is proposed to compute the
optimal control policy. In the second problem, we focus on a subclass of LTL
constraints, which consist of an arbitrary LTL formula and an invariant
constraint. We then investigate the problem of computing a control policy that
minimizes the expected number of invariant constraint violations while
maximizing the probability of satisfying the arbitrary LTL constraint. We
characterize the optimality condition for the desired control policy. A policy

occurrence patterns of event sequences is crucial to predict which typeof
events will happen next and when. A de facto standard mathematical framework to
do this is the Hawkes process. In order to enhance expressivity of multivariate
Hawkes processes, conventional statistical methods and deep recurrent networks
have been employed to modify its intensity function. The former is highly
interpretable and requires small size of training data but relies on correct
model design while the latter has less dependency on prior knowledge and is
more powerful in capturing complicated patterns. We leverage pros and cons of
these models and propose a self-attentive Hawkes process(SAHP). The proposed
method adapts self-attention to fit the intensity function of Hawkes processes.
This design has two benefits:(1) compared with conventional statistical
methods, the SAHP is more powerful to identify complicated dependency
relationships between temporal events; (2)compared with deep recurrent
networks, the self-attention mechanism is able to capture longer historical
information, and is more interpretable because the learnt attention weight
tensor shows contributions of each historical event. Experiments on four
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

purposes, it is enough to consider specific models of a type theory, but
sometimes it is necessary to refer to the syntax, for example in proofs of
canonicity and normalisation. One option is to embed the syntax deeply, by
using inductive definitions in a proof assistant. However, in this case the
handling of definitional equalities becomes technically challenging.
Alternatively, we can reuse conversion checking in the metatheory by shallowly
embedding the object theory. In this paper, we consider the standard model of a
type theoretic object theory in Agda. This model has the property that all of
its equalities hold definitionally, and we can use it as a shallow embedding by
building expressions from the components of this model. However, if we are to
reason soundly about the syntax with this setup, we must ensure that
distinguishable syntactic constructs do not become provably equal when
shallowly embedded. First, we prove that shallow embedding is injective up to
definitional equality, by modelling the embedding as a syntactic translation
targeting the metatheory. Second, we use an implementation hiding trick to
disallow illegal propositional equality proofs and constructions which do not
come from the syntax. We showcase our technique with very short formalisations
of canonicity and parametricity for Martin-L\""of type theory. Our technique
only requires features which are available in all major proof assistants based
on dependent type theory.

magnetic fields generate emergent, exotic quasiparticles phenomenologically
distinct from electrons. Specifically, electrons bind with an even number of
flux quanta, and transform into composite fermions (CFs). Besides providing an
intuitive explanation for the fractional quantum Hall states, CFs also possess
Fermi-liquid-like properties, including a well-defined Fermi sea, at and near
even-denominator Landau level filling factors such as $\nu=1/2$ or $1/4$. Here,
we directly probe the Fermi sea of the rarely studied four-flux CFs near
$\nu=1/4$ via geometric resonance experiments. The data reveal some unique
characteristics. Unlike in the case of two-flux CFs, the magnetic field
positions of the geometric resonance resistance minima for $\nu<1/4$ and
$\nu>1/4$ are symmetric with respect to the position of $\nu=1/4$. However,
when an in-plane magnetic field is applied, the minima positions become
asymmetric, implying a mysterious asymmetry in the CF Fermi sea anisotropy for
$\nu<1/4$ and $\nu>1/4$. This asymmetry, which is in stark contrast to the
two-flux CFs, suggests that the four-flux CFs on the two sides of $\nu=1/4$
have very different effective masses, possibly because of the proximity of the
Wigner crystal formation at small $\nu$.

the Hubble constant $H_0$ could be pointing towards new physics beyond
$\Lambda$CDM. Several attempts to address this tension through new physics rely
on extended models, featuring extra free parameters beyond the 6 $\Lambda$CDM
parameters. However, marginalizing over extra parameters has the effect of
broadening the uncertainties on the inferred parameters, and it is often the
case that within these models the $H_0$ tension is addressed due to larger
uncertainties rather than a genuine shift in the central value of $H_0$. What
happens if a physical theory is able to fix the extra parameters to a specific
set of non-standard values? The degrees of freedom of the model are reduced
with respect to the standard case where the extra parameters are free to vary.
Focusing on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of
relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, I find that physical theories able to fix
$w \approx -1.3$ or $N_{\rm eff} \approx 3.95$ would lead to an estimate of
$H_0$ from CMB, BAO, and SNeIa data in perfect agreement with the local
distance ladder estimate, without broadening its uncertainty. These two
non-standard models are, from a model-selection perspective, strongly
disfavoured with respect to $\Lambda$CDM. However, models that predict $N_{\rm
eff} \approx 3.45$ would be able to bring the tension down to $1.5\sigma$ while
only being weakly disfavored with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, whereas models that
predict $w \approx -1.1$ would be able to bring the tension down to $2\sigma$
(at the cost of the preference for $\Lambda$CDM being definite). Finally, I
estimate dimensionless multipliers relating variations in $H_0$ to variations
in $w$ and $N_{\rm eff}$, which can be used to repeat the analysis of this
paper in light of future more precise local distance ladder estimates of $H_0$.

object and scene) Net. In addition, a new loss named scene coherence loss (SCL)
is developed to train the FOSNet and to improve the scene recognition
performance. The proposed SCL is based on the unique traits of the scene that
the 'sceneness' spreads and the scene class does not change all over the image.
The proposed FOSNet was experimented with three most popular scene recognition
datasets, and their state-of-the-art performance is obtained in two sets:
60.14% on Places 2 and 90.37% on MIT indoor 67. The second highest performance
of 77.28% is obtained on SUN 397.

meteoroid collisions was estimated by numerical analysis of impact phenomena

all over the moon surface and are rapidly sterilized due to radiation except
for those microbes within a thick ejecta deposit produced by meteoroids. The
other 20-30% might be shielded from radiation by thick regolith layers that
formed at collapsed layers in craters produced by Mars rock impacts. The total
number of potentially surviving microbes at the thick ejecta deposits is
estimated to be 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than at the Mars rock craters.
The microbe concentration is irregular in the horizontal direction and is
largely depth-dependent due to the radiation sterilization. The surviving
fraction of transported microbes would be only 1 ppm on Phobos and 100 ppm on
Deimos, suggesting that the transport processes and radiation severely affect
microbe survival. The microbe sampling probability from the Martian moons was
also investigated. We suggest that sample return missions from the Martian
moons are classified into Unrestricted Earth-Return missions for 30 g samples
and 10 cm depth sampling, even in our conservative scenario. We also conducted
a full statistical analysis for sampling the regolith of Phobos to include the
effects of uncertainties in input parameters on the sampling probability. The
most likely probability of microbial contamination for return samples is
estimated to be two orders of magnitude lower than the criterion defined by the

robust to perturbations of the weights and can tolerate large perturbations of

in gap opening and migration efficiency. Here we combine state-of-the-art
calculations of homogeneous planet contraction with a population synthesis
code. We find DI constraints to be satisfied if protoplanet formation by GI
occurs in tens of percent of systems if protoplanets `super migrate' to small
separations. In contrast, GI may occur in only a few percent of systems if
protoplanets remain stranded at wide orbits because their migration is
`quenched' by efficient gap opening. We then use the frequency of massive
giants in radial velocity surveys inside 5 AU to break this degeneracy -
observations recently showed that this population does not correlate with the
host star metallicity and is therefore suspected to have formed via GI followed
by inward migration. We find that only the super-migration scenario can
sufficiently explain this population whilst simultaneously satisfying the DI
constraints and producing the right mass spectrum of planets inside 5 AU. If
massive gas-giants inside 5 AU formed via GI, then our models imply that
migration must be efficient and that the formation of GI protoplanets occurs in

distance metric learning problem as finding a feasible point of a constraint
set where the embedding vectors of the training data satisfy desired
intra-class and inter-class proximity. The feasible set induced by the
constraint set is expressed as the intersection of the relaxed feasible sets
which enforce the proximity constraints only for particular samples (a sample
from each class) of the training data. Then, the feasible point problem is to
be approximately solved by performing alternating projections onto those
feasible sets. Such an approach introduces a regularization term and results in
minimizing a typical loss function with a systematic batch set construction
where these batches are constrained to contain the same sample from each class

considered as the class representatives, allowing efficient utilization of hard

$(x_k)$ is bibasic if the expansion of every vector in $[x_k]$ converges not
only in norm, but also in order. We prove that, in this definition, order
convergence may be replaced with uniform convergence, with order boundedness of
the partial sums, or with norm boundedness of finite suprema of the partial
sums.
  The results in this paper extend and unify those from the pioneering paper
""Order Schauder bases in Banach lattices"" by A.Gumenchuk et al. In particular,
we are able to characterize bibasic sequences in terms of the bibasis
inequality, a result they obtained under certain additional assumptions.
  We then embark on a deeper study of their properties. We show that they are
independent of ambient space, stable under small perturbations, and preserved
under sequentially uniformly continuous norm isomorphic embeddings. We consider
several special kinds of bibasic sequences, including permutable sequences,
i.e., sequences for which every permutation is bibasic, and absolute sequences,
i.e., sequences where expansions remain convergent after we replace every term
with its modulus. We provide several equivalent characterizations of absolute
sequences, showing how they relate to bibases and to further modifications of
the basis inequality.
  We further consider bibasic sequences with unique order expansions. We show
that this property does generally depend on ambient space, but not for the
inclusion of $c_0$ into $\ell_\infty$. We also show that small perturbations of
bibases with unique order expansions have unique order expansions, but this is
not true if ""bibases"" is replaced with ""bibasic sequences"".
  Finally, we consider uo-bibasic sequences, which are obtained by replacing
order convergence with uo-convergence in the definition of a bibasic sequence.
We show that such sequences are very common.

modulates the intra-swarm couplings and the damping injected to each slave in

robustifies the design to time-varying delays in intra-swarm communications.

isolation, neglecting the possible interrelation, or causality between AEs.
This study is the first to conduct an exploratory analysis to discover common
sequential chains of AEs following LVAD implantation that are correlated with
important clinical outcomes. This analysis was derived from 58,575 recorded AEs
for 13,192 patients in International Registry for Mechanical Circulatory
Support (INTERMACS) who received a continuousflow LVAD between 2006 and 2015.
The pattern mining procedure involved three main steps: (1) creating a bank of
AE sequences by converting the AEs for each patient into a single,
chronologically sequenced record, (2) grouping patients with similar AE
sequences using hierarchical clustering, and (3) extracting temporal chains of
AEs for each group of patients using Markov modeling. The mined results
indicate the existence of seven groups of sequential chains of AEs,
characterized by common types of AEs that occurred in a unique order. The
groups were identified as: GRP1: Recurrent bleeding, GRP2: Trajectory of device
malfunction & explant, GRP3: Infection, GRP4: Trajectories to transplant, GRP5:
Cardiac arrhythmia, GRP6: Trajectory of neurological dysfunction & death, and
GRP7: Trajectory of respiratory failure, renal dysfunction & death. These
patterns of sequential post-LVAD AEs disclose potential interdependence between
AEs and may aid prediction, and prevention, of subsequent AEs in future

Inspired by the distinct hierarchical structure of brain tumor, we design a
cascaded deep network framework, in which the whole tumor is segmented firstly
and then the tumor internal substructures are further segmented. Considering
that the increase of the network depth brought by cascade structures leads to a
loss of accurate localization information in deeper layers, we construct many
skip connections to link features at the same resolution and transmit detailed
information from shallow layers to the deeper layers. Then we present a loss
weighted sampling (LWS) scheme to eliminate the issue of imbalanced data during
training the network. Experimental results on BraTS 2017 data show that our
architecture framework outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation
algorithms, especially in terms of segmentation sensitivity.

for the underwater image enhancement community to employ its potential. The
exploration of deep underwater image enhancement networks is increasing over
time, and hence; a comprehensive survey is the need of the hour. In this paper,
our main aim is two-fold, 1): to provide a comprehensive and in-depth survey of
the deep learning-based underwater image enhancement, which covers various
perspectives ranging from algorithms to open issues, and 2): to conduct a
qualitative and quantitative comparison of the deep algorithms on diverse
datasets to serve as a benchmark, which has been barely explored before. To be
specific, we first introduce the underwater image formation models, which are
the base of training data synthesis and design of deep networks, and also
helpful for understanding the process of underwater image degradation. Then, we
review deep underwater image enhancement algorithms, and a glimpse of some of
the aspects of the current networks is presented including network
architecture, network parameters, training data, loss function, and training
configurations. We also summarize the evaluation metrics and underwater image
datasets. Following that, a systematically experimental comparison is carried
out to analyze the robustness and effectiveness of deep algorithms. Meanwhile,
we point out the shortcomings of current benchmark datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss several unsolved open issues and suggest possible
research directions. We hope that all efforts done in this paper might serve as
a comprehensive reference for future research and call for the development of
deep learning-based underwater image enhancement.

In particular, we consider the nearest-neighbour Coulomb interaction $U_{nn}$
between two $d$, two $f$, $d$ and $f$ electrons as well as the so-called
correlated hopping term $U_{ch}$ and examine their effects on the density of
conduction $n_d$ (valence $n_f$) electrons and the excitonic momentum

$U_{nn}$ suppresses the formation of zero momentum condensate ($N(q$=$0)$) and
stabilizes the intermediate valence phases with $n_d \sim 0.5, n_f \sim 0.5$,
the correlated hopping term $U_{ch}$ significantly enhances the number of
excitons in the zero-momentum condensate and suppresses the stability region of
intermediate valence phases. The physically most interesting results are
observed if both $U_{nn}$ and $U_{ch}$ are nonzero, when the combined effects
of $U_{nn}$ and $U_{ch}$ are able to generate discontinuous changes in $n_f$,

diagnosis is critical to improving patient outcomes. To diagnose cancer, a
highly trained pulmonologist must navigate a flexible bronchoscope deep into
the branched structure of the lung for biopsy. The biopsy fails to sample the
target tissue in 26-33% of cases largely because of poor registration with the
preoperative CT map. To improve intraoperative registration, we develop two
deep learning approaches to localize the bronchoscope in the preoperative CT
map based on the bronchoscopic video in real-time, called AirwayNet and
BifurcationNet. The networks are trained entirely on simulated images derived
from the patient-specific CT. When evaluated on recorded bronchoscopy videos in
a phantom lung, AirwayNet outperforms other deep learning localization
algorithms with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.97. Using
AirwayNet, we demonstrate autonomous driving in the phantom lung based on video
feedback alone. The robot reaches four targets in the left and right lungs in
95% of the trials. On recorded videos in eight human cadaver lungs, AirwayNet
achieves areas under the precision-recall curve ranging from 0.82 to 0.997.

problem by convex optimization whose objective is a weighted combination of the
new tensor nuclear norm and the $\ell_1$-norm. In theory, we show that under
certain incoherence conditions, the convex program exactly recovers the

TRPCA model generalizes existing works. In particular, if the studied tensor
reduces to a matrix, our TRPCA model reduces to the known matrix RPCA. Our new
TRPCA which is allowed to use general linear transforms can be regarded as an
extension of our former TRPCA work which uses the discrete Fourier transform.
But their proof of the recovery guarantee is different. Numerical experiments

theory in the context of lattices of numbers. A number lattice $L_S$ is a
collection of row vectors, over $\mathbb{Q}$ on a finite column set $S,$
generated by integral linear combination of a finite set of row vectors. A
generalized number lattice $K_S$ is the sum of a number lattice $L_S$ and a
vector space $V_S$ which has only the zero vector in common with it. The dual
$K^d_S$ of a generalized number lattice is the collection of all vectors whose
dot product with vectors in $K_S$ are integral and is another generalized
number lattice. We consider a linking operation ('matched composition`) between
generalized number lattices $K_{SP},K_{P}$ (regarded as collections of row
vectors on column sets $S\cup P, P,$ respectively with $S,P,$ disjoint) defined
by $K_{SP}\leftrightarrow K_{P}\equiv \{f_S:((f_S,g_P)\in K_{SP}, g_P \in
K_{P}\}.$ We show that this operation together with contraction and
restriction, and the results, the implicit inversion theorem (which gives
simple conditions for the equality $K_{SP}\leftrightarrow

($(K_{SP}\leftrightarrow K_{P})^d= K_{SP}^d\leftrightarrow K_{P}^d$)), are both
relevant and useful in suggesting problems concerning number lattices and their

constructing new self dual lattices from old. We also give new and efficient
algorithms for the following. Given $V_{SP},K_P,$ such that

this theory, newborn stars move downstream of this position as they come into
view, forming a downstream spiral which is tighter, with a smaller pitch angle

see spiral arms as essentially transient structures, may demand that pitch
angle should not depend on wavelength. We measure the pitch angle of a large

very young stars (8.0 {\mu}m, H-{\alpha} line and 151 nm in the far-UV) and
show that they all have the same pitch angle, which is larger than the pitch
angle measured for the same galaxies at optical and near-infrared wavelengths.
Our measurements in the B band and at 3.6 {\mu}m have unambiguously tighter
spirals than the starforming wavelengths. In addition, we have measured in the

views from cameras and data streams from vehicle sensors to create a network of
distributed digital twins, called an edge twin, on fog machines. The edge twin
will be continuously updated with the locations of both autonomous and
human-piloted vehicles on the road segments. The vehicle locations will be
harvested from overhead cameras as well as location feeds from the vehicles
themselves. Although the edge twin can make fair road space allocations from a
global viewpoint, there is a communication cost (delay) in reaching it from the
cameras and vehicular sensors. To address this, we introduce a machine learning
forecaster as a part of the edge twin which is responsible for predicting the
future location of vehicles. Lastly, we introduce a box algorithm that will use
the forecasted values to create a hazard map for the road segment which would
be used by the framework to suggest safe manoeuvres for the autonomous vehicles

epidemic risk at high spatial resolutions can enable effective public health
interventions. Our goal is to identify the risk of importation of such diseases
into vulnerable cities at the granularity of neighborhoods. Conventional models
cannot achieve such spatial resolution, especially in real-time. Besides, they
lack real-time data on demographic heterogeneity, which is vital for accurate
risk estimation. Social media, such as Twitter, promise data from which
demographic and spatial information could be inferred in real-time. On the
other hand, such data can be noisy and inaccurate. Our novel approach leverages
Twitter data, using machine learning techniques at multiple spatial scales to
overcome its limitations, to deliver results at the desired resolution. We
validate our method against the Zika outbreak in Florida in 2016. Our main
contribution lies in proposing a novel approach that uses machine learning on
social media data to identify the risk of vector-borne disease importation at a
sufficiently fine spatial resolution to permit effective intervention. This
will lead to a new generation of epidemic risk assessment models, promising to
transform public health by identifying specific locations for targeted
intervention.
