observation of all or a subset of its entries in the presence of Poisson noise.
When we observe all entries, this is a problem of matrix denoising; when we
observe only a subset of the entries, this is a problem of matrix completion.
In both cases, we exploit an assumption that the underlying matrix is low-rank.
Specifically, we analyze several estimators, including a constrained
nuclear-norm minimization program, nuclear-norm regularized least squares, and
a nonconvex constrained low-rank optimization problem. We show that for all
three estimators, with high probability, we have an upper error bound (in the
Frobenius norm error metric) that depends on the matrix rank, the fraction of
the elements observed, and maximal row and column sums of the true matrix. We
furthermore show that the above results are minimax optimal (within a universal
constant) in classes of matrices with low rank and bounded row and column sums.
We also extend these results to handle the case of matrix multinomial denoising
and completion.

training while avoiding injuries, athletes and coaches need to determine safe
workload levels. The International Olympic Committee has recommended using the
acute:chronic workload ratio (ACRatio) to monitor injury risk, and has provided
thresholds to minimize risk. However, there are several limitations to the
ACRatio which may impact the validity of current recommendations. In this
review, we discuss previously published and novel challenges with the ACRatio,
and possible strategies to address them. These challenges include 1)
formulating the ACRatio as a proportion rather than a measure of change, 2) its
use of unweighted averages to measure activity loads, 3) inapplicability of the
ACRatio to sports where athletes taper their activity, 4) discretization of the
ACRatio prior to model selection, 5) the establishment of the model using
sparse data, 6) potential bias in the ACRatio of injured athletes, 7)
unmeasured confounding, and 8) application of the ACRatio to subsequent

the Hubbard interaction on the three nearest neighbors of the removed carbon

of the Kondo model is a particle-hole symmetric spin-$1/2$ doublet, with
ferromagnetic coupling between the three impurity spins; for moderate potential
scattering, the ground state becomes a particle-hole asymmetric spin singlet,

is inherited by the Anderson model containing the hydrogen impurity and all

when charged to 80 kV, the driver supplies 185-kA peak-current into a short
Ni-wire load with 220-ns, 10-90%, rise time. The total internal inductance of
our driver was measured to be about 60 nH. The revised driver model shows that
when fully charged to 100 kV, the driver will supply 180-kA peak-current with
150-ns rise-time into the x-pinch load. The corresponding current rise rate is
about 1.2 kA/ns. To prove the driver x-pinch efficiency and to estimate the
x-ray radiation performance, we could, for example, image an exploding wires,

high-performance unipolar optoelectronic devices is presented. The local
oscillator (LO) is a quantum cascade laser, while the receiver is an antenna
coupled quantum well infrared photodetector optimized to operate in a
microcavity configuration. Measurements of the saturation intensity show that
these receivers have a linear response up to very high optical power, an
essential feature for heterodyne detection. By an accurate passive
stabilization of the local oscillator and minimizing the optical feed-back the
system reaches, at room temperature, a record value of noise equivalent power
of 30 pW at 9um. Finally, it is demonstrated that the injection of microwave
signal into our receivers shifts the heterodyne beating over the bandwidth of
the devices. This mixing property is a unique valuable function of these

semi-regular variables. These stars are on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB),
and are characterized by high luminosity, changing surface composition, and
intense mass loss, that make them of paramount importance for stellar,
galactic, and extra-galactic studies.
  An initial investigation of LPVs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the
DR2 catalog of LPVs has revealed the possibility to disentangle O-rich and
C-rich stars using a combination of optical Gaia and infrared 2MASS photometry.
The so-called Gaia-2MASS diagram constructed to achieve this has further been
shown to enable the identification of sub-groups of AGB stars among the O-rich
and C-rich LPVs.
  Here, we extend this initial study of the Gaia-2MASS diagram to the Small
Magellanic Cloud and the Galaxy, and use a variability amplitude proxy to
identify LPVs from the full Gaia DR2 archive. We show that the remarkable
properties found in the LMC also apply to these other stellar systems.
Interesting features, moreover, emerge as a result of the different
metallicities between the three stellar environments, which we highlight in
this exploratory presentation of Gaia's potential to study stellar populations
harboring LPVs.
  Finally, we look ahead to the future, and highlight the power of the
exploitation of Gaia RP spectra for the identification of carbon stars using
solely Gaia data in forthcoming data releases, as revealed in an Image of the

gravitational waves with for example the LIGO/Virgo collaboration are a
mystery. We investigate the idea that some of these black holes originate from
the centers of extremely low-mass ultra-dwarf galaxies that have merged
together in the distant past at $z>1$. Extrapolating the central black hole to
stellar mass ratio suggests that the black holes in these mergers could arise
from galaxies of masses $\sim 10^{5} - 10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}\,$. We investigate
whether these galaxies merge enough, or too much, to be consistent with the
observed GW rate of $\sim 9.7-101$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ using the latest
LIGO/Virgo results. We show that in the nearby universe the merger rate and
number densities of ultra-dwarf galaxies are too low, by an order or magnitude,
to produce these black hole mergers. However, by considering that the merger
fraction, merger-time scales, and the number densities of low-mass galaxies all
conspire at $z>1-1.5$ to increase the merger rate for these galaxies at higher
redshifts we argue that it is possible that some of the observed GW events
arise from BHs in the centers of low-mass galaxies. The major uncertainty in
this calculation is the dynamical time-scales for black holes in low-mass
galaxies. Our results however suggest a very long BH merger time-scale of 4-7
Gyr, consistent with an extended black hole merger history. Further simulations
are needed to verify this possibility, however our theory can be tested by
searching for host galaxies of gravitational wave events. Results from these
searches would will put limits on dwarf galaxy mergers and/or the presence and
formation mechanisms of black holes through PopIII stars in the lowest mass
galaxies.

physics of certain interacting Dirac systems, such as repulsive spinless
fermions on the honeycomb lattice or $\pi$-flux square lattice. The torus
energy spectrum has been shown previously to serve as a characteristic
fingerprint of relativistic fixed points and is a powerful tool to discriminate
quantum critical behaviour in numerical simulations. Here, we use a combination
of exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo simulations of strongly
interacting fermionic lattice models, to compute the critical torus energy
spectrum on finite-size clusters with periodic boundaries and extrapolate them
to the thermodynamic limit. Additionally, we compute the torus energy spectrum
analytically using the perturbative expansion in ${\epsilon = 4 - D}$, which is
in good agreement with the numerical results, thereby validating the presence
of the chiral Ising fixed point in the lattice models at hand. We show that the
strong interaction between the spinor field and the scalar order-parameter
field strongly influences the critical torus energy spectrum and we observe
prominent multiplicity features related to an emergent symmetry predicted from
the quantum field theory. Building on these results we are able to address the
subtle crossover physics of the low-energy spectrum flowing from the chiral

information when interpreting road scenes and generating behaviour plans.
Although curbs convey important information, they are difficult to detect in
complex urban environments (in particular in comparison to other elements of
the road such as traffic signs and road markings). These difficulties arise
from occlusions by other traffic participants as well as changing lighting
and/or weather conditions. Moreover, road boundaries have various shapes,
colours and structures while motion planning algorithms require accurate and
precise metric information in real-time to generate their plans.
  In this paper, we present a real-time LIDAR-based approach for accurate curb
detection around the vehicle (360 degree). Our approach deals with both
occlusions from traffic and changing environmental conditions. To this end, we
project 3D LIDAR pointcloud data into 2D bird's-eye view images (akin to
Inverse Perspective Mapping). These images are then processed by trained deep
networks to infer both visible and occluded road boundaries. Finally, a
post-processing step filters detected curb segments and tracks them over time.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
real-world driving data. Hence, we believe that our LIDAR-based approach
provides an efficient and effective way to detect visible and occluded curbs

increasingly popular technique for determining the 3-D structure of a molecule
from several noisy 2-D projections images taken at unknown viewing angles. Most
reconstruction algorithms require a low-resolution initialization for the 3-D
structure, which is the goal of ab initio modeling. Suggested by Zvi Kam in
1980, the method of moments (MoM) offers one approach, wherein low-order
statistics of the 2-D images are computed and a 3-D structure is estimated by
solving a system of polynomial equations. Unfortunately, Kam's method suffers
from restrictive assumptions, most notably that viewing angles should be
distributed uniformly. Often unrealistic, uniformity entails the computation of
higher-order correlations, as in this case first and second moments fail to
determine the 3-D structure. In the present paper, we remove this hypothesis,
by permitting an unknown, non-uniform distribution of viewing angles in MoM.
Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this case is statistically easier than the
uniform case, as now first and second moments generically suffice to determine
low-resolution expansions of the molecule. In the idealized setting of a known,
non-uniform distribution, we find an efficient provable algorithm inverting
first and second moments. For unknown, non-uniform distributions, we use
non-convex optimization methods to solve for both the molecule and
distribution.

$\widetilde{O}(n^{5/3}/\epsilon^{2} \cdot \mathrm{EO})$. In this paper we
present a classical and a quantum algorithm for approximate submodular
minimization. Our classical result improves on the algorithm of [CLSW17] and
runs in time $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}/\epsilon^2 \cdot \mathrm{EO})$. Our quantum
algorithm is, up to our knowledge, the first attempt to use quantum computing
for submodular optimization. The algorithm runs in time
$\widetilde{O}(n^{5/4}/\epsilon^{5/2} \cdot \log(1/\epsilon) \cdot
\mathrm{EO})$. The main ingredient of the quantum result is a new method for
sampling with high probability $T$ independent elements from any discrete
probability distribution of support size $n$ in time $O(\sqrt{Tn})$. Previous
quantum algorithms for this problem were of complexity $O(T\sqrt{n})$.

are obtained by analytic, probabilistic and combinatoric tools.
  The first chapter deals with the strong polarization problem. This states
that for any sequence $u_1,\dots, u_n$ of norm 1 vectors in a real Hilbert
space $\mathscr H$, there exists a unit vector $v \in \mathscr H$, such that $$
\sum \frac{1}{\langle u_i, v \rangle^2} \leq n^2. $$ The 2-dimensional case is
proved by complex analytic methods. For the higher dimensional extremal cases,
we prove a tensorisation result that is similar to F. John's theorem about
characterisation of ellipsoids of maximal volume. From this, we deduce that the
only full dimensional locally extremal system is the orthonormal system. We
also obtain the same result for the weaker, original polarization problem.
  The second chapter investigates a problem in probabilistic geometry. Take $n$
independent, uniform random points in a triangle $T$. Convex chains between two
fixed vertices of $T$ are defined naturally. Let $L_n$ denote the maximal size
of a convex chain. We prove that the expectation of $L_n$ is asymptotically
$\alpha \, n^{1/3}$, where $\alpha$ is a constant between 1.5 and 3.5 -- we
conjecture that the correct value is 3. We also prove strong concentration
results for $L_n$, which, in turn, imply a limit shape result for the longest
convex chains.

best performing methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
require extensive datasets for training. However, at test time, they fail to
impose consistency between the super-resolved image and the given
low-resolution image, a property that classic reconstruction-based algorithms
naturally enforce in spite of having poorer performance. Motivated by this
observation, we propose a new framework that joins both approaches and produces
images with superior quality than any of the prior methods. Although our
framework requires additional computation, our experiments on Set5, Set14, and
BSD100 show that it systematically produces images with better peak signal to

dipole-dipole interactions enhance or reduce the blocking temperature $T_{B}$
of nanoparticle assemblies. It seems that the samples play a central role in
the problem and therefore, their geometry should most likely be the key factor
in this issue. Yet, in a previous work, J\""onsson and Garcia-Palacios did
investigate theoretically this problem in a weak-interaction limit and without
the presence of an external DC field. Based on symmetry arguments they reached
the conclusion that the variation of the relaxation rate is monotonous. In the
presence of an external magnetic field we show that these arguments may no
longer hold depending on the experimental geometry. Therefore, the aim of this
paper is to evaluate the variation of $T_{B}$ for a model system consisting of
a chain of ferromagnetic nanoparticles coupled with long-range dipolar
interaction with two different geometries. Rather than addressing a
quantitative analysis, we focus on the qualitative variation of $T_{B}$ as a
function of the interparticle distance a and of the external field $h$. The two
following situations are investigated: a linear chain with a longitudinal axial
anisotropy in a longitudinal DC field and a linear chain with a longitudinal
axial anisotropy in a transverse field.

with an enormous number of states, where function approximation must be

introduction of function approximation raises a fundamental set of challenges

  This paper presents the first provable RL algorithm with both polynomial

independent random walks in the Massive Parallel Computation (MPC) model with
space per machine strongly sublinear in the number of vertices. In this
space-per-machine regime, many natural approaches to graph problems struggle to
overcome the $\Theta(\log n)$ MPC round complexity barrier. Our techniques
enable breaking this barrier for PageRank---one of the most important
applications of random walks---even in more challenging directed graphs, and
for approximate bipartiteness and expansion testing.
  In the undirected case, we start our random walks from the stationary
distribution, which implies that we approximately know the empirical
distribution of their next steps. This allows for preparing continuations of
random walks in advance and applying a doubling approach. As a result we can
generate multiple random walks of length $l$ in $\Theta(\log l)$ rounds on MPC.
Moreover, we show that under the popular 1-vs.-2-Cycles conjecture, this round
complexity is asymptotically tight.
  For directed graphs, our approach stems from our treatment of the PageRank
Markov chain. We first compute the PageRank for the undirected version of the
input graph and then slowly transition towards the directed case, considering
convex combinations of the transition matrices in the process.
  For PageRank, we achieve the following round complexities for damping factor
equal to $1 - \epsilon$:
  * in $O(\log \log n + \log 1 / \epsilon)$ rounds for undirected graphs (with
$\tilde O(m / \epsilon^2)$ total space),
  * in $\tilde O(\log^2 \log n + \log^2 1/\epsilon)$ rounds for directed graphs

for exponentially long times in terms of the entropy, and it eventually
saturates at a constant value also exponential in terms of the entropy. This

distance: for any set $S$ in the product space of probability $\epsilon$, a
random point in the space, with probability $1-\delta$, has a neighbor in $S$
that is different from the original point in only
$O(\sqrt{n\ln(1/(\epsilon\delta))})$ coordinates. We obtain the tight
computational version of this result, showing how given a random point and
access to an $S$-membership oracle, we can find such a close point in
polynomial time. This resolves an open question of [Mahloujifar and Mahmoody,
ALT 2019]. As corollaries, we obtain polynomial-time poisoning and (in certain
settings) evasion attacks against learning algorithms when the original
vulnerabilities have any cryptographically non-negligible probability.
  We call our algorithm MUCIO (""MUltiplicative Conditional Influence
Optimizer"") since proceeding through the coordinates, it decides to change each
coordinate of the given point based on a multiplicative version of the
influence of that coordinate, where influence is computed conditioned on
previously updated coordinates.
  We also define a new notion of algorithmic reduction between computational
concentration of measure in different metric probability spaces. As an
application, we get computational concentration of measure for high-dimensional
Gaussian distributions under the $\ell_1$ metric.
  We prove several extensions to the results above: (1) Our computational
concentration result is also true when the Hamming distance is weighted. (2) We
obtain an algorithmic version of concentration around mean, more specifically,
McDiarmid's inequality. (3) Our result generalizes to discrete random
processes, and this leads to new tampering algorithms for collective coin
tossing protocols. (4) We prove exponential lower bounds on the average running

computing. Measurements of a time-varying process of interest are acquired by a
sensor node, and uploaded to a cloud server to undergo some required
computations. These computations consume random amounts of service time that
are independent and identically distributed across different uploads. After the
computations are done, the results are delivered to a monitor, constituting an
update. The goal is to keep the monitor continuously fed with fresh updates
over time, which is assessed by an age-of-information (AoI) metric. A scheduler
is employed to optimize the measurement acquisition times. Following an update,
an idle waiting period may be imposed by the scheduler before acquiring a new
measurement. The scheduler also has the capability to preempt a measurement in
progress if its service time grows above a certain cutoff time, and upload a
fresher measurement in its place. Focusing on stationary deterministic
policies, in which waiting times are deterministic functions of the
instantaneous AoI and the cutoff time is fixed for all uploads, it is shown
that the optimal waiting policy that minimizes the long term average AoI has a
threshold structure, in which a new measurement is uploaded following an update
only if the AoI grows above a certain threshold that is a function of the
service time distribution and the cutoff time. The optimal cutoff is then found
for standard and shifted exponential service times. While it has been
previously reported that waiting before updating can be beneficial for AoI, it
is shown in this work that preemption of late updates can be even more
beneficial.

Galactic archaeology. That is, to reconstruct the evolutionary narrative of the
Milky Way, based on the empirical data that describes its current
morphological, dynamical, temporal and chemical structures. Here, we describe a
path to achieving this goal. The critical observational objective is a
Galaxy-scale, contiguous, comprehensive mapping of the disk's phase space,
tracing where the majority of the stellar mass resides. An ensemble of recent,
ongoing, and imminent surveys are working to deliver such a transformative
stellar map. Once this empirical description of the dust-obscured disk is
assembled, we will no longer be operationally limited by the observational
data. The primary and significant challenge within stellar astronomy and
Galactic archaeology will then be in fully utilizing these data. We outline the
next-decade framework for obtaining and then realizing the potential of the
data to chart the Galactic disk via its stars. One way to support the
investment in the massive data assemblage will be to establish a Galactic
Archaeology Consortium across the ensemble of stellar missions. This would
reflect a long-term commitment to build and support a network of personnel in a
dedicated effort to aggregate, engineer, and transform stellar measurements
into a comprehensive perspective of our Galaxy.

an alternative to halo mass. In particular, using a semi-analytic galaxy
formation model applied to the Millennium WMAP7 simulation, we explore the
extent that switching to $\vmax$ as the primary halo property incorporates the
effects of assembly bias into the formalism. We consider fixed number density
galaxy samples ranked by stellar mass and examine the variations in the halo
occupation functions with either halo concentration or formation time. We find
that using $\vmax$ results in a significant reduction in the occupancy
variation of the central galaxies, particularly for concentration. The
satellites occupancy variation on the other hand increases in all cases. We
find effectively no change in the halo clustering dependence on concentration,
for fixed bins of $\vmax$ compared to fixed halo mass. Most crucially, we
calculate the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering by comparing the
amplitude of clustering to that of a shuffled galaxy sample, finding that the
level of galaxy assembly bias remains largely unchanged. Our results suggest
that while using $\vmax$ as a proxy for halo mass diminishes some of occupancy
variations exhibited in the galaxy-halo relation, it is not able to encapsulate
the effects of assembly bias potentially present in galaxy clustering. The use
of other more complex halo properties, such as $\vpeak$, the peak value of

further investigation.

challenge -- a meta-algorithm called PROPEL -- is based on three insights.
First, we view our learning task as optimization in policy space, modulo the
constraint that the desired policy has a programmatic representation, and solve
this optimization problem using a form of mirror descent that takes a gradient
step into the unconstrained policy space and then projects back onto the
constrained space. Second, we view the unconstrained policy space as mixing
neural and programmatic representations, which enables employing
state-of-the-art deep policy gradient approaches. Third, we cast the projection
step as program synthesis via imitation learning, and exploit contemporary
combinatorial methods for this task. We present theoretical convergence results
for PROPEL and empirically evaluate the approach in three continuous control
domains. The experiments show that PROPEL can significantly outperform
state-of-the-art approaches for learning programmatic policies.

factor. The velocity dispersion of the CO line, $\sigma_v$, scales
approximately as the inverse square root of $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$, making the
empirical gas scale height determined from $H\sim0.5\sigma^2/(\pi G\Sigma_{\rm

$\Sigma_{\rm mol}$. This constancy of $H$ implies that the average midplane
density, which is presumably dominated by CO-emitting gas for these extreme
star-forming galaxies, scales linearly with the gas surface density, which, in
turn, implies that the gas dynamical rate (the inverse of the free-fall time)
varies with $\Sigma_{\rm mol}^{1/2}$, thereby explaining most of the
super-linear slope in the KS relation. Consistent with these relations, we also
find that the mean efficiency of star formation per free-fall time is roughly
constant, 5%-7%, and the gas depletion time decreases at high $\Sigma_{\rm
mol}$, reaching only $\sim 16$ Myr at $\Sigma_{\rm mol}\sim10^4\;M_\odot$

constancy of $H$ are in tension with some feedback-driven models, which predict
$\sigma_v$ to be more constant and $H$ to be more variable. However, these
results are consistent with simulations in which large-scale gravity drives
turbulence through a feedback process that maintains an approximately constant
Toomre $Q$ instability parameter.

binary orbital plane. Their simulations showed that alignment from $48^\circ$
to a polar configuration can take place on a shorter timescale than the age of
this system. We perform hydrodynamical numerical simulations in order to
estimate the cavity size carved by the eccentric binary for different disk
inclinations as an independent check of polar alignment. Resonance theory
suggests that torques on the inner parts of a polar disk around such a highly
eccentric binary are much weaker than in the coplanar case, indicating a
significantly smaller central cavity than in the coplanar case. We show that
the inferred inner radius (from carbon monoxide measurements) of the accretion

decades, owing to their importance for a wide range of technologies, and
interest in their fundamental mechanisms. This work investigates the leakage
currents through atomic layer deposited (ALD) $Al_2O_3$, grown on $SrTiO_3$.
This combination is not only a key building block of oxide electronics, but
also a clean system for studying the leakage mechanisms without interfacial
layers that form on most of the conventional bottom electrodes. We show how
tiny differences in the deposition process can have a dramatic effect on the
leakage behavior. Detailed analysis of the leakage behavior rules out
Fowler-Nordheim tunneling (FNT) and thermionic emission, and leaves the
trap-related mechanisms of trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) and Poole-Frenkel as
the likely mechanisms. After annealing the sample in air, the currents are
reduced, which is ascribed to transition from trap-based mechanism to FNT, due
to the elimination of the traps. The dramatic role of the assumptions regarding
the flat-band voltage used for analysis is critically discussed, and the
sensitivity of the extracted parameters on this magnitude is quantitatively
described. We show that field effect devices based on structures similar to
those described here, should be able to modulate $>10^{13} cm^{-2}$ electrons.
These results provide general guidelines for reducing and analyzing leakage
currents in insulators, and highlight some of the possible approaches and

impact is that such unifying models 1) render what we consider up to now as
fundamentally different data structures to be seen as views of the very same
overall design space, and 2) allow seeing new data structure designs with
performance properties that are not feasible by existing designs. The core
intuition behind the construction of design continuums is that all data
structures arise from the very same set of fundamental design principles, i.e.,
a small set of data layout design concepts out of which we can synthesize any
design that exists in the literature as well as new ones. We show how to
construct, evaluate, and expand, design continuums and we also present the
first continuum that unifies major data structure designs, i.e., B+tree,
B-epsilon-tree, LSM-tree, and LSH-table.
  The practical benefit of a design continuum is that it creates a fast
inference engine for the design of data structures. For example, we can predict
near instantly how a specific design change in the underlying storage of a data
system would affect performance, or reversely what would be the optimal data
structure (from a given set of designs) given workload characteristics and a
memory budget. In turn, these properties allow us to envision a new class of
self-designing key-value stores with a substantially improved ability to adapt
to workload and hardware changes by transitioning between drastically different

We address fundamental flaws in previously used metrics and show how Dynamic

define the normalized Dynamic Time Warping (nDTW) metric, that softly penalizes

nodes composing each path, is suited for both continuous and graph-based
evaluations, and can be efficiently calculated. Further, we define SDTW, which
constrains nDTW to only successful paths. We collect human similarity judgments
for simulated paths and find nDTW correlates better with human rankings than
all other metrics. We also demonstrate that using nDTW as a reward signal for
Reinforcement Learning navigation agents improves their performance on both the

itself only at short diffusion times while at large times, in particular, under

theories following the Baulieu-Singer approach in the (anti-)self-dual Landau
gauges. This is a gauge-fixed approach that allows to recover the topological
spectrum, as first constructed by Witten, by means of an equivariant (or
constrained) BRST cohomology. As standard gauge-fixed Yang-Mills theories
suffer from the gauge copy (Gribov) ambiguity, one might wonder if and how this
has repercussions for this analysis. The resolution of the small
(infinitesimal) gauge copies, in general, affects the dynamics of the
underlying theory. In particular, treating the Gribov problem for the standard
Landau gauge condition in non-topological Yang-Mills theories strongly affects
the dynamics of the theory in the infrared. In the current paper, although the
theory is investigated with the same gauge condition, the effects of the copies
turn out to be completely different. In other words: in both cases, the copies
are there, but the effects are very different. As suggested by the tree-level
exactness of the topological model in this gauge choice, the Gribov copies are
shown to be inoffensive at the quantum level. To be more precise, following
Gribov, we discuss the path integral restriction to the Gribov horizon. The
associated gap equation, which fixes the so-called Gribov parameter, is however
shown to only possess a trivial solution, making the restriction obsolete. We
relate this to the absence of radiative corrections in both gauge and ghost
sectors. We give further evidence by employing the renormalization group which
shows that, for this kind of topological model, the gap equation indeed forbids
the introduction of a massive Gribov parameter.

controllers that solve an optimization-based control problem online. The
control inputs computed by the base controllers provide starting points for the
optimization problem of the parallel controllers, which operate in parallel
within a limited time budget that does not exceed the control sampling time.
The resulting control system is very flexible and its architecture can easily
be modified or changed online, e.g., by adding or eliminating controllers, for
online improvement of the performance of the controlled system. In a case
study, the proposed control architecture is implemented for highway traffic,
which is characterized by nonlinear, fast dynamics with multiple control
constraints, to minimize the overall travel time of the vehicles, while
increasing their total traveled distance within the fixed simulation time
window. The results of the simulation show the excellent real-time (i.e.,
within the given time budget) performance of the proposed control architecture,
with the least realized value of the overall cost function. Moreover, among the
online control approaches considered for the case study, the average cost per

applications such as inertial navigation [1], north-finding [2], geophysical

for rotation sensing is Sagnac interferometry, in which a wave is split,
traverses two paths that enclose an area, and then recombined. The resulting
interference signal depends on the rotation rate of the system and the area
enclosed by the paths [5]. Optical Sagnac interferometers are an important
component in present-day navigation systems [6], but suffer from limited
sensitivity and stability. Interferometers using matter waves are intrinsically
more sensitive and have demonstrated superior gyroscope performance [7-9], but
the benefits have not been large enough to offset the substantial increase in
apparatus size and complexity that atomic systems require. It has long been
hoped that these problems might be overcome using atoms confined in a guiding
potential or trap, as opposed to atoms falling in free space [10-12]. This
allows the atoms to be supported against gravity, so a long measurement time
can be achieved without requiring a large drop distance. The guiding potential
can also be used to control the trajectory of the atoms, causing them to move
in a circular loop that provides the optimum enclosed area for a given linear
size [13]. Here we use such an approach to demonstrate a rotation measurement
with Earth-rate sensitivity.

Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. While collider phenomenology does not exclude the
possibility for some of these new scalar fields to be light, it is relatively
natural to consider masses in the multi-TeV range, in which case the only
remaining light Higgs boson automatically receives SM-like properties. The
appearance of a hierarchy between the new-physics states and the electroweak
scale then leads to sizable electroweak corrections, e. g. in the decays of the
heavy Higgs bosons, which are dominated by effects of infrared type, namely
Sudakov logarithms. Such radiative contributions obviously affect the two-body
decays, but should also be paired with the radiation of electroweak gauge
bosons (or lighter Higgs bosons) for a consistent picture at the one-loop
order. Resummation of the leading terms is also relatively easy to achieve. We
re-visit these questions in the specific case of the fermionic decays of heavy

reaction using 160, 280, and 400 MeV 16O beams impinging on a carbon target was
used to investigate the 12C(16O,7a) reaction. This permits a search for
near-threshold states in the alpha-conjugate nuclei up to 24Mg. Results: Events
up to an alpha-particle multiplicity of 7 were measured and the results were
compared to both an Extended Hauser-Feshbach calculation and the Fermi break-up
model. The measured multiplicity distribution exceeded that predicted from a
sequential decay mechanism and had a better agreement with the multi-particle
Fermi break-up model. Examination of how these 7 alpha final states could be
reconstructed to form 8Be and 12C(0_2+) showed a quantitative difference in
which decay modes were dominant compared to the Fermi break-up model. No new
states were observed in 16O, 20Ne, and 24Mg due to the effect of the N-alpha
penetrability suppressing the total alpha-particle dissociation decay mode.
Conclusion: The reaction mechanism for a high energy compound nucleus reaction
can only be described by a hybrid of sequential decay and multi-particle
breakup. Highly alpha-clustered states were seen which did not originate from
simple binary reaction processes. Direct investigations of near-threshold
states in N-alpha systems are inherently impeded by the Coulomb barrier
prohibiting the observation of states in the N-alpha decay channel. No evidence
of a highly clustered 15.1 MeV state in 16O was observed from
(28Si*,12C(0_2+))16O(0_6+) when reconstructing the Hoyle state from 3
alpha-particles. Therefore, no experimental signatures for alpha-condensation
were observed.

  We first note that the scheduling problem can be reduced to a clean geometric
set cover problem where points on a line with arbitrary demands, must be
covered by a minimum cost collection of given intervals with non-uniform
capacity profiles. Unfortunately, current techniques for such problems based on
knapsack cover inequalities and low union complexity, completely lose the
geometric structure in the non-uniform capacity profiles and incur at least an
$\Omega(\log\log P)$ loss.
  To this end, we consider general covering problems with non-uniform

preserves their geometric structure. This allows us to use sophisticated
geometric ideas in a black-box way to avoid the $\Omega(\log \log P)$ loss in

ALPs (with mass $<10^{-11}\,{\rm eV}$); as X-ray photons from an embedded or

Apart from iron-band features, the spectrum is described by a power-law
continuum, with any spectral distortions at the $<3\%$ level. We compute photon
survival probabilities as a function of ALP mass $m_a$ and ALP-photon coupling
constant $g_{a\gamma}$ for an ensemble of ICM magnetic field models, and then
use the NGC1275 spectrum to constraint the $(m_a, g_{a\gamma})$-plane.

differential equations to reduce their order and hence decrease computational
complexity. A reduced system can be obtained, e.g., by time-limited balanced
truncation, a method that aims to construct an accurate reduced order model on
a given finite time interval $[0, T]$. This particular balancing related MOR
technique is studied in this paper. An $L^2_T$-error bound based on the
truncated time-limited singular values is proved and is the main result of this
paper. The derived error bound converges (as $T\rightarrow \infty$) to the
well-known $\mathcal H_\infty$-error bound of unrestricted balanced truncation,
a scheme that is used to construct a good reduced system on the entire time
line. The techniques within the proofs of this paper can also be applied to
unrestricted balanced truncation so that a relatively short time domain proof
of the $\mathcal H_\infty$-error bound is found here.

in a Floquet Hamiltonian in which all the interactions are tunable; this

polymers on a semi-infinite cylinder of perimeter $n$. In the lattice loop
model, contractible loops have a vanishing fugacity whereas non-contractible
loops have a fugacity $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. These correlators are defined as
ratios $Z(x)/Z_0$ of partition functions, where $Z_0$ is a reference partition
function wherein only simple arcs are attached to the boundary of the cylinder.
For $Z(x)$, the boundary is also decorated with simple arcs, but it also has
two positions $1$ and $x$ where the boundary condition is different. We
investigate two such kinds of boundary conditions: (i) there is a single node
at each of these points where a long arc is attached, and (ii) there are pairs
of adjacent nodes at these points where two long arcs are attached.
  We find explicit expressions for these correlators for finite $n$ using the
representation of the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra in the XX spin
chain. The resulting asymptotics as $n\to\infty$ are expressed as simple
integrals that depend on the parameter $\tau=\frac{x-1}n\in(0,1)$. For small
$\tau$, the leading behaviours are proportional to $\tau^{1/4}$,
$\tau^{1/4}\log \tau$, $\log\tau$ and $\log^2\tau$.
  We interpret the lattice results in terms of ratios of conformal correlation
functions. We assume that the corresponding boundary changing fields are
highest weight states in irreducible, Kac or staggered Virasoro modules, with
central charge $c=-2$ and conformal dimensions $\Delta = -\frac18$ or
$\Delta=0$. We obtain differential equations satisfied by the conformal
correlators, solve these equations, and find a perfect agreement with the
lattice results. We compute structure constants and ratios thereof which appear

techniques for alleviating deep dynamic stall of a SD7003 airfoil in plunging

number is $M=0.1$. Numerical simulations are performed with a finite difference
based solver that incorporates high-order compact schemes for differentiation,
interpolation and filtering on a staggered grid. A mesh convergence study is
conducted and results show good agreement with available data in terms of
aerodynamic coefficients. Different spanwise arrangements of actuators are
implemented to simulate blowing and suction at the airfoil leading edge. We
observe that, for a specific frequency range of actuation, mean drag and drag
fluctuations are substantially reduced while mean lift is maintained almost
unaffected, especially for a 2D actuator setup. For this frequency range, 2D
flow actuation disrupts the formation of the dynamic stall vortex, what leads
to drag reduction due to a pressure increase along the airfoil suction side,
towards the trailing edge region. At the same time, pressure is reduced on the
suction side near the leading edge, increasing lift and further reducing drag.

formulation (Goldstein. J. Fluid Mech 488, pp. 315-333, 2003) to develop a
noise prediction model for the peak sound of axisymmetric round jets at
subsonic acoustic Mach numbers ($Ma$). The analogy shows that the exact formula
for the acoustic pressure is given by a convolution product of a propagator
tensor (determined by the vector Green's function of the adjoint linearized
Euler equations for a given jet mean flow) and a generalized source term
representing the jet turbulence field.
  Using a low frequency/small spread rate asymptotic expansion of the
propagator, mean flow non-parallelism enters the lowest order Green's function
solution via the streamwise component of the mean flow advection vector in a
hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE). We then address the predictive
capability of the solution to this PDE when used in the analogy through
first-of-its-kind numerical calculations when an experimentally-verified model
of the turbulence source structure is used together with Reynolds-averaged
Navier Stokes solutions for the jet mean flow. Our noise predictions show a
reasonable level of accuracy in the peak noise direction at $Ma=0.9$, for
Strouhal number up to about $0.6$, and at $Ma=0.5$ using modified source
coefficients. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Moreover, the prediction

allow for a bulk solar/chondritic Earth. If it did exist, such a hidden

networks to disseminate messages. The energy-efficiency of broadcast is
important particularly when devices in the network are energy constrained. To
improve the efficiency of broadcast, different approaches have been taken in
the literature. One of these approaches is broadcast with energy accumulation.
Through simulations, it has been shown in the literature that broadcast with
energy accumulation can result in energy saving. The amount of this saving,
however, has only been analyzed for linear multi-hop wireless networks. In this
work, we extend this analysis to two-dimensional (2D) multi-hop networks. The
analysis of saving in 2D networks is much more challenging than that in linear
networks. It is because, unlike in linear networks, in 2D networks, finding
minimum-energy broadcasts with or without energy accumulation are both NP-hard
problems. Nevertheless, using a novel approach, we prove that this saving is
constant when the path loss exponent alpha is strictly greater than two. Also,

first study the landscape of the corresponding population risk, which is

establish a correspondence between the critical points of the empirical risk

wedges of power-law profile and flexural wave reflection from acoustic black
holes is examined. The geometrical acoustics theory of localised flexural waves
in wedges of power-law profile is briefly discussed. It is noted that, for
wedge profiles with power-law exponents equal or larger than two, the
velocities of all localised modes take zero values, unless there is a wedge
truncation. It is demonstrated that this effect of zero velocities of localised
flexural waves in ideal wedges is closely related to the phenomenon of zero
reflection of flexural waves from ideally sharp one-dimensional acoustic black
holes. A possible influence of localised wedge modes on flexural wave
reflection from one-dimensional acoustic black holes having rough edges is
discussed. With regard to two-dimensional acoustic black holes, the role of
localised flexural waves propagating along wedge edges that are curved in their
middle plane is considered. Such waves can propagate along edges of inner holes
in two-dimensional acoustic black holes formed by circular indentations in
plates of constant thickness. A possible impact of such localised waves on the
processes of scattering of flexural waves by edge imperfections of inner holes
in two-dimensional acoustic black holes is discussed, including their influence
on the efficiency of two-dimensional acoustic black holes as vibration dampers.

a network of interacting parts. It is, in fact, the network organisation (more
than the parts) what largely conditions most higher-level properties, which are
not reducible to the properties of the individual parts. Can the topological
organisation of these webs provide some insight into their evolutionary
origins? Both biological and artificial networks share some common
architectural traits. They are often heterogeneous and sparse, and most exhibit
the small-world property or the presence of modular or hierarchical patterns.
These properties have often been attributed to the selection of functionally
meaningful traits. However, the proper formulation of generative network models
suggests a rather different picture. Against the standard
selection-optimisation argument, some networks reveal the inevitable generation
of complex patterns resulting from reuse and can be modelled using
duplication-rewiring rules. These give rise to the heterogeneous, scale-free
and modular architectures observed in the real case studies. Tinkering is a
universal mechanism that drives not only biological evolution but also the
large-scale dynamics of some technological designs. Here we examine the
evidence for tinkering in cellular, technological and ecological webs and its
impact in shaping their architecture and deeply affecting their functional
properties. Our analysis suggests to seriously reconsider the role played by
selection forces or design principles as main drivers of network evolution.

not explored and analyzed. The knowledge of the generative physics and
chemistry of the material can obviate this problem, since defect configuration
libraries as stochastic representation of atomic level structures can be

polarimetric imaging observations of the oxygen-rich AGB star IK Tau obtained
with SPHERE-ZIMPOL (phase 0.27) as well as interferometric observations with
AMBER. IK Tau was observed with ZIMPOL at three wavelengths in the
pseudo-continuum (645, 748, and 820 nm), in the H$\alpha$ line at 656.3 nm, and
in the TiO band at 717 nm. The AMBER observations were carried out in the
wavelength region of the CO first overtone lines near 2.3 $\mu$m (R=12 000).
The polarimetric imaging capabilities of SPHERE-ZIMPOL have allowed us to
spatially resolve clumpy dust clouds at 20--50 mas from the central star, which
corresponds to 2--5 $R_{\star}$ when combined with a central star's angular
diameter of 20.7$\pm$1.53 mas measured with AMBER. The diffuse, asymmetric dust
emission extends out to $\sim$73 $R_{\star}$. We find that the TiO emission
extends to 150 mas (15 $R_{\star}$). The AMBER data in the CO lines also
suggest a molecular outer atmosphere extending to $\sim$1.5 $R_{\star}$. The
results of our 2-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer modelling of dust clumps
suggest that the polarized intensity and degree of linear polarization can be
reasonably explained by small-sized (0.1 $\mu$m) grains of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$,
MgSiO$_{3}$, or Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$ in an optically thin shell

previously studied AGB stars W Hya, R Dor, and $o$ Cet. Nevertheless, our
observations of IK Tau revealed that clumpy dust formation occurs close to the
star as seen in those low mass-rate AGB stars.

the orbital evolution of satellites and rings, especially Saturn's ring arcs
and associated moons. In this work, we examine interactions among massive
bodies in the same corotation eccentricity resonance site that affect the
orbital evolution of those bodies using numerical simulations. During these
simulations, the bodies exchange angular momentum and energy during close
encounters, altering their orbits. This energy exchange, however, does not mean
that one body necessarily moves closer to exact corotation when the other moves
away from it. Indeed, if one object moves towards one of these sites, the other
object is equally likely to move towards or away from it. This happens because
the timescale of these close encounters is short compared to the synodic period
between these particles and the secondary mass (i.e., the timescale where
corotation sites can be treated as potential maxima). Because the timescale of
a gravitational encounter is comparable to the timescale of a collision, we
could expect energy to be exchanged in a similar way for collisional
interactions. In that case, these findings could be relevant for denser systems
like the arcs in Neptune's Adams ring and how they can be maintained in the
face of frequent inelastic collisions.

employing a novel approach, where the new Hamiltonian is time-independent when

electron dynamics is clearly revealed and the threshold values of the amplitude
of the perturbative laser field for triggering stochastic electron acceleration
are derived for different laser polarization directions and initial electron
momentum. It demonstrates that the dephasing rate (new Hamiltonian) between the
electron and the dominant laser can be randomly reduced if the amplitude of the
perturbative laser is above the threshold such that the electron could be
accelerated by the dominant laser well beyond the ponderomotive energy scaling.
The impact of a superluminal phase velocity is examined, which slightly changes
the stochastic region in Hamiltonian space if the superluminal phase velocity
is under a threshold value but significantly decreases the maximum electron
kinetic energy. All the analytic considerations are confirmed by the numerical

first to develop a complete theoretical analysis of the electrophoretic motion
of a charged spherical particle under the influence of an external electric

particles. The solution of this problem required mastery of fluid mechanics,
colloidal electrostatics, statistical thermodynamics and transport theory in
addition to solid applied mathematics. Theo carried out this study as his

theory in 1+1 dimensions (YM$_{1+1}$) by operator-algebraic methods. The latter
are based on Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory and multi-scale analysis via
inductive limits of $C^{*}$-algebras which are applicable in arbitrary
dimensions. The major step, restricted to one spatial dimension, is the
explicitly construction of the spatially-localized von Neumann algebras of
time-zero fields in the time gauge in representations associated with scaling
limits of Gibbs states of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. We relate our work to
existing results about YM$_{1+1}$ and its counterpart in Euclidean quantum
field theory (YM$_{2}$). In particular, we show that the operator-algebraic
approach offers a unifying perspective on results about YM$_{1+1}$ obtained by
Dimock as well as Driver and Hall, especially regarding the existence of
dynamics. Although our constructions work for non-abelian gauge theory, we
obtain the most explicit results in the abelian case by applying the results of
our recent companion article. In view of the latter, we also discuss relations
with the construction of unitary representations of Thompson's groups by Jones.
To understand the scaling limits arising from our construction, we explain our
findings via a rigorous adaptation of the Wilson-Kadanoff renormalization
group, which connects our construction with the multi-scale entanglement
renormalization ansatz (MERA). Finally, we discuss potential generalizations

to improve computational performance by allowing longer time-step intervals.
Even though the equations of motion are Galilean invariant, LES results have
been observed to depend on the translation velocity. It is found that LES
results of shallow convection depend on the domain translation velocity even
when a Galilean invariant formulation is used. This type of model error is
named residual cross-grid flow error, to emphasize the expectation that it
should be negligible or zero. The residual gross-grid flow error is caused by
biases in finite difference dispersion errors. Schemes with low resolving power
(typically low order of accuracy) produce larger dispersion errors that can be
amplified by large-scale flow asymmetries, such as strong updrafts in
cumulus-cloud layers. Accordingly, the cross-grid flow error strongly depends
on the order of accuracy of the numerical scheme progressively becoming
negligible as the order of accuracy is increased from second to sixth in the
present simulations.

of two other BSSs, WOCS1006 and WOCS2011, with the latter showing a deficient

results are consistent with simulations where the CGM is complex and
outflowing, accreting, and recycled gas are well-homogenized at $z<0.7$. The
presence of low metallicity gas at all orientations suggests that cold streams
of accreting filaments are not necessarily aligned with the galaxy plane at low

passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase
shifts, IRS achieve a high passive beamforming gain, which is appealing for
drastically enhancing the WPT efficiency and thereby the R-E trade-off of SWIPT

by EHRs via jointly optimizing the transmit precoders at the AP and reflect
phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the individual
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for IDRs. Since this
problem is non-convex, we propose efficient algorithms to obtain suboptimal
solutions for it. In particular, we prove that it is sufficient to send
information signals only at the AP to serve both IDRs and EHRs regardless of
their channel realizations. Moreover, simulation results show significant
performance gains achieved by our proposed designs over benchmark schemes.

In the user representation model we learn the representations of users based on
the representations of their clicked news articles. Since different words and
different news articles may have different informativeness for representing
news and users, we propose to apply both word- and news-level attention
mechanism to help our model attend to important words and news articles. In
addition, the same news article and the same word may have different
informativeness for different users. Thus, we propose a personalized attention
network which exploits the embedding of user ID to generate the query vector
for the word- and news-level attentions. Extensive experiments are conducted on
a real-world news recommendation dataset collected from MSN news, and the
results validate the effectiveness of our approach on news recommendation.

external magnetic field at higher magnetic field, suggesting that field-induced
canting of the AFM spins plays an important role. In contrast, around the
coercive field, no detectable SMR signal is observed, indicating that SMR of
AFM and canting magnetization components cancel out. Below 50~K, the SMR
amplitude increases sizably by a factor of two as compared to room temperature,
which likely correlates with the long-range ordering of the Sm ions. Our
results show that the SMR is a sensitive technique for non-equilibrium spin

Notably, models with multi-head attention such as Transformer have demonstrated
extreme effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies in a variety of

Developing such models is challenging due to the lack of data on UAM behavior

on large datasets to produce realistic trajectories, this paper presents an
approach to encounter modeling that instead relies on expert knowledge. In
particular, recent advances in preference-based learning are extended to tune
an encounter model from expert preferences. The model takes the form of a
stochastic policy for a Markov decision process (MDP) in which the reward
function is learned from pairwise queries of a domain expert. We evaluate the
performance of two querying methods that seek to maximize the information
obtained from each query. Ultimately, we demonstrate a method for generating
realistic encounter trajectories with only a few minutes of an expert's time.

to help users find interested news and improve user experience. News and user
representation learning is critical for news recommendation. Existing news
recommendation methods usually learn these representations based on single news
information, e.g., title, which may be insufficient. In this paper we propose a
neural news recommendation approach which can learn informative representations
of users and news by exploiting different kinds of news information. The core
of our approach is a news encoder and a user encoder. In the news encoder we
propose an attentive multi-view learning model to learn unified news
representations from titles, bodies and topic categories by regarding them as
different views of news. In addition, we apply both word-level and view-level
attention mechanism to news encoder to select important words and views for
learning informative news representations. In the user encoder we learn the
representations of users based on their browsed news and apply attention
mechanism to select informative news for user representation learning.
Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show our approach can effectively
improve the performance of news recommendation.

from their corresponding canonical forms. Our key observation is that more
discriminative features can be learned by solving specially-designed generative
tasks compared to traditional classification-based feature learning frameworks.
Specifically, we design a GAN-based model to make the learned deep feature of a
given scene character be capable of reconstructing corresponding glyphs in a
number of standard font styles. In this manner, we obtain deep features for
scene characters that are more discriminative in recognition and less sensitive
against the above-mentioned factors. Our experiments conducted on several

opportunities for the formal analysis of singularities and catastrophes. This
article looks at the historical context of singularities through the work of
two eminent Frenchmen around the late 1960s and 1970s. Ren\'e Thom (1923-2002)
was an acclaimed mathematician having received the Fields Medal in 1958,
whereas G\'erard Debreu (1921-2004) would receive the Nobel Prize in economics
in 1983. Both were highly influential within their fields and given the
fundamental nature of their work, the potential for cross-fertilisation would
seem to be quite promising. This was not to be the case: Debreu knew of Thom's
work and cited it in the analysis of his own work, but despite this and other
applied mathematicians taking catastrophe theory to economics, the theory never
achieved a lasting following and relatively few results were published. This
article reviews Debreu's analysis of the so called ${\it regular}$ and ${\it
crtitical}$ economies in order to draw some insights into the economic
perspective of singularities before moving to how singularities arise naturally
in the Nash equilibria of game theory. Finally a modern treatment of stochastic
game theory is covered through recent work on the quantal response equilibrium.
In this view the Nash equilibrium is to the quantal response equilibrium what
deterministic catastrophe theory is to stochastic catastrophe theory, with some
caveats regarding when this analogy breaks down discussed at the end.

move on the surface in search of food or to form micro-colonies. Twitching is
one such form of motility employed by bacteria such as N. gonorrhoeae, in which
the polymeric extensions known as type IV pili mediate its movement. Pili
extending from cell body adheres to the surface and pulls the bacteria by
retraction. The bacterial movement is decided by the two-dimensional tug-of-war
between the pili attached to the surface. Natural surfaces in which these
micro-crawlers dwell are generally spatially inhomogeneous and have varying
surface properties. Their motility is known to be affected by the topography of
the surfaces. Therefore, it is possible to control bacterial movement by
designing structured surfaces which can be potentially utilized for controlling
biofilm architecture. In this paper, we numerically investigate the twitching
motility in a two-dimensional corrugated channel. The bacterial movement is
simulated by two different models: (a) a detailed tug-of-war model which
extensively describe the twitching motility of bacteria assisted by pili and
(b) a coarse-grained run-and-tumble model which depicts the motion of
wide-ranging self-propelled particles. The simulation of bacterial motion
through asymmetric corrugated channels using the above models show
rectification. The bacterial transport depends on the geometric parameters of
the channel and inherent system parameters such as persistence length and
self-propelled velocity. In particular, the variation of the particle current
with the geometric parameters of the micro-channels show that one can optimize
the particle current for specific values of these parameters.

classifiers, has proven extremely difficult to solve. This is true even when,
as is the case in many practical settings, the classifier is hosted as a remote
service and so the adversary does not have direct access to the model
parameters.
  This paper argues that in such settings, defenders have a much larger space
of actions than have been previously explored. Specifically, we deviate from
the implicit assumption made by prior work that a defense must be a stateless
function that operates on individual examples, and explore the possibility for
stateful defenses.
  To begin, we develop a defense designed to detect the process of adversarial
example generation. By keeping a history of the past queries, a defender can
try to identify when a sequence of queries appears to be for the purpose of
generating an adversarial example. We then introduce query blinding, a new
class of attacks designed to bypass defenses that rely on such a defense
approach.
  We believe that expanding the study of adversarial examples from stateless
classifiers to stateful systems is not only more realistic for many black-box
settings, but also gives the defender a much-needed advantage in responding to
the adversary.

hBN films of different thicknesses are grown using metalorganic vapour phase
epitaxy technique by following a flow modulation scheme. Though these films of
relatively large size are potential candidates to be employed in designing real
devices, they exhibit wrinkling. The formation of wrinkles is a key signature
of strain distribution in a film. Raman imaging has been utilized to study the
residual strain distribution in these wrinkled hBN films. An increase in the
overall compressive strain in the films with an increase in the layer thickness
has been observed. To find whether the residual lattice strain in the films can
be removed by a thermal treatment, temperature dependent Raman measurements of
these films are carried out. The study demonstrates that the thermal rate of
strain evolution is higher in the films of lower thickness than in the thicker
films. This observation further provides a possible explanation for the
variation of strain in the as-grown films. An empirical relation has been
proposed for estimating the residual strain from the morphology of the films.
We have also shown that the residual strain can be partially released by the

recover degraded underwater images. Especially, a multi-scale densely connected

use an edge preserving network module to enhance the detail of the recovered

and pathology research by helping doctors make more accurate diagnoses. On the
other hand, accurate diagnosis by MRI remains a great challenge as images
obtained via present MRI techniques usually have low resolutions. Improving MRI
image quality and resolution thus becomes a critically important task. This
paper presents an innovative Coupled-Projection Residual Network (CPRN) for MRI
super-resolution. The CPRN consists of two complementary sub-networks: a
shallow network and a deep network that keep the content consistency while
learning high frequency differences between low-resolution and high-resolution
images. The shallow sub-network employs coupled-projection for better retaining
the MRI image details, where a novel feedback mechanism is introduced to guide
the reconstruction of high-resolution images. The deep sub-network learns from
the residuals of the high-frequency image information, where multiple residual
blocks are cascaded to magnify the MRI images at the last network layer.
Finally, the features from the shallow and deep sub-networks are fused for the
reconstruction of high-resolution MRI images. For effective fusion of features
from the deep and shallow sub-networks, a step-wise connection (CPRN S) is
designed as inspired by the human cognitive processes (from simple to complex).
Experiments over three public MRI datasets show that our proposed CPRN achieves
superior MRI super-resolution performance as compared with the

biased when cross-winds are present along the propagation path. Infrasound from

high spatial resolution on an array 178 km almost due North. The array is
situated in the classical shadow-zone distance from the explosions. However,
strong infrasound is almost always observed, which is most plausibly due to
partial reflections from stratospheric altitudes. The most probable propagation
paths are subject to both tropospheric and stratospheric cross-winds, and our
wave-propagation modelling yields good correspondence between the observed
backazimuth deviation and cross-winds from the ERA-Interim reanalysis product.
We demonstrate that atmospheric cross-winds can be estimated directly from

light on this fundamental question has recently been shed through a resurgence

experiment addressing the quantum measurement problem -- the difficulty of
reconciling the (unitary, deterministic) evolution of isolated systems and the
(non-unitary, probabilistic) state update after a measurement. Here, by
building on a scenario with two separated but entangled friends introduced by
Brukner, we prove that if quantum evolution is controllable on the scale of an
observer, then one of 'No-Superdeterminism', 'Locality' or 'Absoluteness of
Observed Events' -- that every observed event exists absolutely, not relatively
-- must be false. We show that although the violation of Bell-type inequalities
in such scenarios is not in general sufficient to demonstrate the contradiction
between those three assumptions, new inequalities can be derived in a
theory-independent manner, that are violated by quantum correlations. This is
demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment where a photon's path is deemed
an observer. We discuss how this new theorem places strictly stronger
constraints on physical reality than Bell's theorem.

However, RNNs are limited by their recurrent nature in terms of computational

the GPU parallelism with their feedforward architectures. However, little
attention has been paid to performing NER with CNNs, mainly owing to their
difficulties in capturing the long-term context information in a sequence. In

gated relation network (GRN), which is more capable than common CNNs in
capturing long-term context. Specifically, in GRN we firstly employ CNNs to
explore the local context features of each word. Then we model the relations
between words and use them as gates to fuse local context features into global
ones for predicting labels. Without using recurrent layers that process a
sentence in a sequential manner, our GRN allows computations to be performed in
parallel across the entire sentence. Experiments on two benchmark NER datasets

drag force. The study is based on simulations of a canonical drag test, which
involves vertically uplifting a plate through a granular packing with a
prescribed acceleration pattern. Depending on the plate size, plate depth and
acceleration pattern, results evidence a rate-independent regime and an
inertial regime where the object acceleration strongly enhances the drag force.
We introduce an elasto-inertial drag force model that captures the measured
drag forces in these two regimes. The model is based on observed physical
processes including a gradual, elasto-inertial mobilisation of grains located
above the plate. These results and analysis point out fundamental differences
between mobility in granular materials upon steady and unsteady loadings.

  Surveillance Programs",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Low-risk prostate cancer patients enrolled in active surveillance
programs commonly undergo biopsies for examination of cancer progression.
Biopsies are conducted as per a fixed and frequent schedule (e.g., annual
biopsies). Since biopsies are burdensome, patients do not always comply with
the schedule, which increases the risk of delayed detection of cancer
progression.
  Objective: Our aim is to better balance the number of biopsies (burden) and
the delay in detection of cancer progression (less is beneficial), by
personalizing the decision of conducting biopsies.
  Data Sources: We use patient data of the world's largest active surveillance
program (PRIAS). It enrolled 5270 patients, had 866 cancer progressions, and an
average of nine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and five digital rectal
examination (DRE) measurements per patient.
  Methods: Using joint models for time-to-event and longitudinal data, we model
the historical DRE and PSA measurements, and biopsy results of a patient at
each follow-up visit. This results in a visit and patient-specific cumulative
risk of cancer progression. If this risk is above a certain threshold, we
schedule a biopsy. We compare this personalized approach with the currently
practiced biopsy schedules via an extensive and realistic simulation study,
based on a replica of the patients from the PRIAS program.
  Results: The personalized approach saved a median of six biopsies (median: 4,
IQR: 2-5), compared to the annual schedule (median: 10, IQR: 3-10). However,
the delay in detection of progression (years) is similar for the personalized
(median: 0.7, IQR: 0.3-1.0) and the annual schedule (median: 0.5, IQR:
0.3-0.8).
  Conclusions: We conclude that personalized schedules provide substantially
better balance in the number of biopsies per detected progression for men with
low-risk prostate cancer.

of radiative transfer equations for coupled surface and body waves in a scalar
approximation. Our model is based on the Helmholtz equation in a half-space
geometry with mixed boundary conditions. In this model, Green's function can be
represented as a sum of body waves and surface waves, which mimics the
situation on Earth. In a first step, we study the single-scattering problem for
point-like objects in the Born approximation. Using the assumption that the
phase of body waves is randomized by surface reflection or by interaction with
the scatterers, we show that it becomes possible to define, in the usual
manner, the cross-sections for surface-to-body and body-to-surface scattering.
Adopting the independent scattering approximation, we then define the
scattering mean free paths of body and surface waves including the coupling
between the two types of waves. Using a phenomenological approach, we then
derive a set of coupled transport equations satisfied by the specific energy
density of surface and body waves in a medium containing a homogeneous
distribution of point scatterers. In our model, the scattering mean free path
of body waves is depth dependent as a consequence of the body-to-surface
coupling. We demonstrate that an equipartition between surface and body waves
is established at long lapse-time, with a ratio which is predicted by usual
mode counting arguments. We derive a diffusion approximation from the set of
transport equations and show that the diffusivity is both anisotropic and depth
dependent. The physical origin of the two properties is discussed. Finally, we
present Monte-Carlo solutions of the transport equations which illustrate the
convergence towards equipartition at long lapse-time as well as the importance
of the coupling between surface and body waves in the generation of coda waves.

feature phenomenologically. It is a puzzle that the energy shift is found to be
repulsive in all of the observed kaonic atom, although the $K^-N$ interaction
is known to be so attractive as to form the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance. To solve
this puzzle, we examine the $K^-$ optical potential in the linear density
approximation and determine the potential parameters of each kaonic atom so as
to reproduce the observed energy shift and absorption width. We find two types
of the potentials. One potential has a so large real part as to provide nuclear
states with the same quantum number to the atomic state in the last orbit. The
level repulsion between the atomic state and the nuclear states takes place due
to their mixing, and it makes the atomic state shifted repulsively. The other
type of the potential has a large imaginary part and the imaginary part works
repulsively for atomic states. We find that only the latter solution reproduce
a wide of the observed data, and thus is realized as a $K^-$-nucleus potential
for kaonic atom. In the linear nuclear density optical potential, the picture
that the repulsive shifts in the atomic states stem from the existence of the
nuclear states does not globally stand up. This implies that the $K^-$-nucleus
optical potential should have a large imaginary part. We examine some nonlinear
density effects and find that the conclusion does not change. We also confirm
that the conventionally known optical potentials are categorized into the
latter type of the potential.

This paper describes a few of the modelling challenges that underlie monitoring
and observation of processes in IT, by human or by software. The topic of the
observability of systems has been elevated recently in connection with computer
monitoring and tracing of processes for debugging and forensics. It raises the
issue of well-known principles of measurement, in bounded contexts, but these
issues have been left implicit in the Computer Science literature. This paper
aims to remedy this omission, by laying out a simple promise theoretic model,
summarizing a long standing trail of work on the observation of distributed
systems, based on elementary distinguishability of observations, and classical
causality, with history. Three distinct views of a system are sought, across a
number of scales, that described how information is transmitted (and lost) as
it moves around the system, aggregated into journals and logs.

is solved via a simple alternating block coordinate descent technique. We
conduct extensive experiments on a variety of set-learning tasks and

reservoir computing turned out to be a very promising approach especially for
the reproduction of the long-term properties of a nonlinear system. Yet, a
thorough statistical analysis of the forecast results is missing. Using the
Lorenz and R\""ossler system we statistically analyze the quality of prediction
for different parametrizations - both the exact short-term prediction as well
as the reproduction of the long-term properties (the ""climate"") of the system
as estimated by the correlation dimension and largest Lyapunov exponent. We
find that both short and longterm predictions vary significantly among the
realizations. Thus special care must be taken in selecting the good predictions
as predictions which deliver better short-term prediction also tend to better
resemble the long-term climate of the system. Instead of only using purely
random Erd\""os-Renyi networks we also investigate the benefit of alternative
network topologies such as small world or scale-free networks and show which
effect they have on the prediction quality. Our results suggest that the
overall performance with respect to the reproduction of the climate of both the

system there seems to be a slight benefit of using small world networks while
for the R\""ossler system small world and Erd\""os -Renyi networks performed
equivalently well. In general the observation is that reservoir computing works

representation, called Adversarial Video Distillation (AVD). The key idea is to
represent videos by compressing them in the form of realistic images, which can
be used in a variety of video-based scene analysis applications. Representing a
video as a single image enables us to address the problem of video analysis by
image analysis techniques. To this end, we exploit a 3D convolutional
encoder-decoder network to encode the input video as an image by minimizing the
reconstruction error. Furthermore, weak supervision by an adversarial training
procedure is imposed on the output of the encoder to generate semantically
realistic images. The encoder learns to extract semantically meaningful

input of deep models pre-trained on images for video classification. We

Such approaches use meta-heuristic search guided by search operators (model
mutators and sometimes breeders) implemented as model transformations. The
design of these operators can substantially impact the effectiveness and
efficiency of the meta-heuristic search. Currently, designing search operators
is left to the person specifying the optimisation problem. However, developing
consistent and efficient search-operator rules requires not only domain
expertise but also in-depth knowledge about optimisation, which makes the use
of model-based meta-heuristic search challenging and expensive. In this paper,
we propose a generalised approach to automatically generate atomic consistency

reduces the effort required to specify an optimisation problem and shields
optimisation users from the complexity of implementing efficient meta-heuristic
search mutation operators. We evaluate our approach with a set of case studies,

cases better than, manually created rules at guiding evolutionary search

strategies that can be effectively and efficiently applied when regularizing
large-scale linear inverse problems by combining standard Tikhonov
regularization and projection onto Krylov subspaces of increasing dimension
(computed by the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization algorithm). The success of this
regularization approach heavily depends on the accurate tuning of two
parameters (namely, the Tikhonov parameter and the dimension of the projection
subspace): these are simultaneously set using new strategies that can be
regarded as special instances of bilevel optimization methods, which are solved
by using a new paradigm that interlaces the iterations performed to project the
Tikhonov problem (lower-level problem) with those performed to apply a given
parameter choice rule (higher-level problem). The discrepancy principle, the
GCV, the quasi-optimality criterion, and Regi\'{n}ska criterion can all be
adapted to work in this framework. The links between Gauss quadrature and
Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization are exploited to prove convergence results for
the discrepancy principle, and to give insight into the behavior of the other
considered regularization parameter choice rules. Several numerical tests
modeling inverse problems in imaging show that the new parameter choice
strategies lead to regularization methods that are reliable, and intrinsically
simpler and cheaper than other strategies already available in the literature.

see instead that the states in the Landau bands take the form of stationary

the thin film, turning into edge states with distinctive profiles at the
lateral boundaries for the two different types of Hall effect.

SU(2) Yang--Mills theory is calculated in the perturbative and weak coupling
regime i.e. in a small open ball about the flat connection (what we call the
vicinity of the vacuum) and when the gauge coupling constant acquires a small
but finite value.
  The computation is based on various known inequalities, valid only in four
dimensions, providing two-sided estimates for the exponentiated Yang--Mills
action in terms of the $L^2$-norm of the derivative of the gauge potential
only; these estimates then give rise to Gaussian-like infinite dimensional
integrals involving the Laplacian hence can be formally computed via
zeta-function and heat kernel techniques. It then turns out that these
integrals give a sharp value for the partition function in the aforementioned
perturbative and weak coupling regime of the theory.

coupling constant is shifted to a smaller one which can be interpreted as the
manifestation, in this approach, of the existence a non-trivial trivial
$\beta$-function and asymptotic freedom in non-Abelian gauge theories.

signal at given time instants; however, sampling and reconstructing a signal
using multiple devices in parallel becomes a more difficult problem to solve
when the devices have an unknown shift in their clocks.
  Alternatively, one can record the times at which a signal (or its integral)
crosses given thresholds. This can model integrate-and-fire neurons, for
example, and has been studied by Lazar and T\'oth under the name of ``Time
Encoding Machines''. This sampling method is closer to what is found in nature.
  In this paper, we show that, when using time encoding machines,
reconstruction from multiple channels has a more intuitive solution, and does
not require the knowledge of the shifts between machines. We show that, if
single-channel time encoding can sample and perfectly reconstruct a
$\mathbf{2\Omega}$-bandlimited signal, then $\mathbf{M}$-channel time encoding
with shifted integrators can sample and perfectly reconstruct a signal with
$\mathbf{M}$ times the bandwidth.
  Furthermore, we present an algorithm to perform this reconstruction and prove
that it converges to the correct unique solution, in the noiseless case,
without knowledge of the relative shifts between the integrators of the
machines. This is quite unlike classical multi-channel sampling, where unknown
shifts between sampling devices pose a problem for perfect reconstruction.

(i), by combining first-principles calculations, based on the density
functional theory (DFT), and simulations of the X-ray Absorption Near-Edge
Structure (XANES) we present a comprehensive picture connecting the atomic
arrangement of borophene and the X-ray absorption spectra. Once we have
characterized the electronic properties of the pristine systems, we next
examined the electronic confinement effects in 2D borophene superlattices
(BSLs) [(ii)]. Here, the BSL structures were made by attaching laterally two
different structural phases of borophene. The energetic stability, and the
electronic properties of those BSLs were examined based on total energy DFT
calculations. We find a highly anisotropic electronic structure, characterized
by the electronic confinement effects, and the formation of metallic channels
along the superlattices. Combining DFT and the Landauer-B\""uttiker formalism,
we investigate the electronic transport properties in the BSLs. Our results of
the transmission probability reveal that the electronic transport is ruled by
{\pi} or a combination of {\pi} and {\sigma} transmission channels, depending
on the atomic arrangement and periodicity of the superlattices. Finally we show
that there is huge magnification on the directional dependence of the
electronic transport properties in BSLs, in comparision with the pristine
borophene phase. Those findings indicate that BSLs are quite interesting
systems in order to design conductive nanoribbons in a 2D platform.

to attract interest. Their probability can often be determined by the optimal
fluctuation method (OFM). The OFM brings about a conditional variational
problem, the solution of which describes the ""optimal path"" of the system which
dominates the contribution of different stochastic paths to the desired
statistics. The OFM proved efficient in evaluating the probabilities of rare
events in a host of systems. However, theoretically predicted optimal paths
were observed in stochastic simulations only in diffusive lattice gases, where
the predicted optimal density patterns are either stationary, or travel with
constant speed. Here we focus on the one-point height distribution of the
paradigmatic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang interface. Here the optimal paths,
corresponding to the distribution tails at short times, are intrinsically
non-stationary and can be predicted analytically. Using the mapping to the
directed polymer in a random potential at high temperature, we obtain
""snapshots"" of the optimal paths in Monte-Carlo simulations which probe the
tails with an importance sampling algorithm. For each tail we observe a very
narrow ""tube"" of height profiles around a single optimal path which agrees with
the analytical prediction. The agreement holds even at long times, supporting
earlier assertions of the validity of the OFM in the tails well beyond the
weak-noise limit.

characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and measured by high
resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with
different photon energies. A systematic evolution of the electronic structure
and superstructure with Pb substitution has been revealed for the first time.
The superstructure shows a significant change with Pb substitution and the
incommensurate modulation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) decreases with increasing Pb
substitution. In the meantime, the superstructure intensity from ARPES
measurements also decreases dramatically with increasing Pb concentration. The
superstructure in Bi2212 can be effectively suppressed by Pb substitution and
it nearly disappears with a Pb substitution of $x=0.8$. We also find that the
superstructure bands in ARPES measurements depend sensitively on the photon
energy of lasers used; they can become even stronger than the main band when
using a laser photon energy of 10.897 eV. These results provide important
information on the origin of the incommensurate superstructure and its control

in the Rel-15 3GPP 5G NR specifications to support low PAPR transmissions using
the DFT-spread-OFDM waveform in the uplink transmissions. To enable data
demodulation using this modulation scheme, Zadoff-Chu sequences are used as
reference signals. However, the PAPR of Zadoff-Chu sequences is higher when

transceiver design which minimizes the PAPR of the reference signals to avoid

we show that PAPR of the reference signal transmission remains the same for any

control systems described by stochastic differential equations of the Ito type.
The considered problem is related to the asymptotic stability property of
invariant sets and has important applications in mechanics and engineering.
Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of an invariant set are
proposed by using a stochastic version of LaSalle's invariance principle. These
conditions are applied for constructing the state feedback controllers in the
problem of single-axis stabilization of a rigid body. The cases of control
torques generated by jet engines and rotors are considered as illustrations of
the proposed control design methodology.

outshines the RV signatures of planets d and h that remain undetected

to handle global implicit descriptions of smooth planar curves. We then apply
this framework to model nonlinear electrical devices as {\em classes of

incremental resistances (and other analogous notions) in homogeneous terms.
This approach, combined with a projectively-weighted version of the matrix-tree
theorem, makes it possible to formulate and address in great generality several

solvability problems in resistive circuits, and discuss a general expression
for the characteristic polynomial of dynamic circuits at equilibria. Previously
known results, which were derived in the literature under unnecessarily

  Samples",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a source of iid samples of edges of an input graph $G$ with $n$
vertices and $m$ edges, how many samples does one need to compute a constant
factor approximation to the maximum matching size in $G$? Moreover, is it
possible to obtain such an estimate in a small amount of space? We show that,
on the one hand, this problem cannot be solved using a nontrivially sublinear
(in $m$) number of samples: $m^{1-o(1)}$ samples are needed. On the other hand,
a surprisingly space efficient algorithm for processing the samples exists:
$O(\log^2 n)$ bits of space suffice to compute an estimate.
  Our main technical tool is a new peeling type algorithm for matching that we
simulate using a recursive sampling process that crucially ensures that local
neighborhood information from `dense' regions of the graph is provided at
appropriately higher sampling rates. We show that a delicate balance between
exploration depth and sampling rate allows our simulation to not lose precision
over a logarithmic number of levels of recursion and achieve a constant factor
approximation. The previous best result on matching size estimation from random
samples was a $\log^{O(1)} n$ approximation [Kapralov et al'14].
  Our algorithm also yields a constant factor approximate local computation
algorithm (LCA) for matching with $O(d\log n)$ exploration starting from any
vertex. Previous approaches were based on local simulations of randomized
greedy, which take $O(d)$ time {\em in expectation over the starting vertex or
edge} (Yoshida et al'09, Onak et al'12), and could not achieve a better than
$d^2$ runtime. Interestingly, we also show that unlike our algorithm, the local
simulation of randomized greedy that is the basis of the most efficient prior
results does take $\wt{\Omega}(d^2)\gg O(d\log n)$ time for a worst case edge
even for $d=\exp(\Theta(\sqrt{\log n}))$.

control of a logarithmic average over $ q$ of a function $G(q,x)$ counting the
number of square roots of $x$ mod $q$. One requires an estimate uniform in $x$.

signatures attributable to dust, but the origin of this dust is uncertain. We
test the hypothesis that the bulk of cluster dust derives from galaxy ejecta.
To do so, we employ dust abundances obtained from detailed chemical evolution
models of galaxies. We integrate the dust abundances over cluster luminosity
functions (one-slope and two-slope Schechter functions). We consider both a
hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation and an independent evolution of the
three main galactic morphologies: elliptical/S0, spiral and irregular. We
separate the dust residing within galaxies from the dust ejected in the
intracluster medium. To the latter, we apply thermal sputtering. The model
results are compared to low-to-intermediate redshift observations of dust
masses. We find that in any of the considered scenarios, elliptical/S0 galaxies
contribute negligibly to the present-time intracluster dust, despite producing
the majority of gas-phase metals in galaxy clusters. Spiral galaxies, instead,
provide both the bulk of the spatially-unresolved dust and of the dust ejected
into the intracluster medium. The total dust-to-gas mass ratio in galaxy
clusters amounts to $10^{-4}$, while the intracluster medium dust-to-gas mass
ratio amounts to $10^{-6}$ at most. These dust abundances are consistent with
the estimates of cluster observations at $0.2 < z <1$. We propose that galactic
sources, spiral galaxies in particular, are the major contributors to the
cluster dust budget.

finding effective network architectures, but suffered from large memory and
computing overheads in jointly training a super-network and searching for an

Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-network to reduce
the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more
efficient search without comprising the performance. In particular, we perform
operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a
shortcut. This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting
the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels. We alleviate it
using edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level parameters to
reduce uncertainty in search. Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can
be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoys both faster speed
and higher training stability. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of
2.57% on CIFAR10 with merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a

removing noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the
relevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow

graph-based semi-supervised learning, which usually integrates node features
and graph topologic information to build learning models. However, as for
multi-label learning tasks, the supervision part of GCN simply minimizes the
cross-entropy loss between the last layer outputs and the ground-truth label
distribution, which tends to lose some useful information such as label
correlations, so that prevents from obtaining high performance. In this paper,
we pro-pose a novel GCN-based semi-supervised learning approach for multi-label
classification, namely ML-GCN. ML-GCN first uses a GCN to embed the node
features and graph topologic information. Then, it randomly generates a label
matrix, where each row (i.e., label vector) represents a kind of labels. The
dimension of the label vector is the same as that of the node vector before the
last convolution operation of GCN. That is, all labels and nodes are embedded
in a uniform vector space. Finally, during the ML-GCN model training, label
vectors and node vectors are concatenated to serve as the inputs of the relaxed
skip-gram model to detect the node-label correlation as well as the label-label
correlation. Experimental results on several graph classification datasets show
that the proposed ML-GCN outperforms four state-of-the-art methods.

transition. Previous work found that in these systems a famous conjecture on
the existence of a lower bound for the ratio of a shear viscosity to entropy is
violated, and proposed a generalization of this bound for anisotropic systems
near charge neutrality involving the electric conductivities. The present study
uses scaling arguments and the gauge-gravity duality to confirm the previous
analysis of universal bounds in anisotropic Dirac systems. We investigate the
strongly-coupled phase of quantum Lifshitz systems in a gravitational
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a linear massless scalar which breaks
translations in the boundary dual field theory and sources the anisotropy. The
holographic computation demonstrates that some elements of the viscosity tensor
can be related to the ratio of the electric conductivities through a simple
geometric ratio of elements of the bulk metric evaluated at the horizon, and
thus obey a generalized bound, while others violate it. From the IR critical
geometry, we express the charge diffusion constants in terms of the square
butterfly velocities. The proportionality factor turns out to be
direction-independent, linear in the inverse temperature, and related to the
critical exponents which parametrize the anisotropic scaling of the dual field
theory.

the same resource block. Although early studies have focused on transmission
reliability and energy efficiency, recent works are considering cooperation
among the nodes. The cooperative NOMA techniques allow the user with a better
channel (near user) to act as a relay between the source and the user
experiencing poor channel (far user). This paper considers the link security
aspect of energy harvesting cooperative NOMA users. In particular, the near
user applies the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol for relaying the message of
the source node to the far user in the presence of an eavesdropper. Moreover,
we consider that all the devices use power-splitting architecture for energy
harvesting and information decoding. We derive the analytical expression of
intercept probability. Next, we employ deep learning based optimization to find
the optimal power allocation factor. The results show the robustness and
superiority of deep learning optimization over conventional iterative search
algorithm.

Extreme events like heat waves, droughts, or floods due to persisting rains are
characterized by large anomalies of the time average of an observable over a

therefore be useful for their analysis. In this paper we discuss how concepts
and numerical algorithms developed in relation with large deviation theory can

study the convergence of large deviation functions for the time averaged

a rare event algorithm can improve the efficiency of the computation of the

for speeding up such codes with neural networks. The originality of our
approach stems from not substituting the whole EBS by a machine learning
algorithm, but only its most problematic and least parallelizable step: the
integration of perturbation equations over time. This approach offers two
significant advantages: the task depends only on a subset of cosmological
parameters, and it is blind to the characteristics of the experiment for which
the output must be computed (for instance, redshift bins). These allow us to
construct a fast and highly re-usable network. In this proof-of-concept paper,
we focus on the prediction of CMB source functions, and design our networks
according to physical considerations and analytical approximations. This allows
us to reduce the depth and training time of the networks compared to a
brute-force approach. Indeed, the calculation of the source functions using the
networks is fast enough so that it is not a bottleneck in the EBS anymore.
Finally, we show that their accuracy is more than sufficient for accurate MCMC
parameter inference from Planck data. This paves the way for a new project,
CosmicNet, aimed at gradually extending the use and the range of validity of
neural networks within EBSs, and saving massive computational time in the
context of cosmological parameter extraction.

additional constraint in the original mathematical programming formulation. We

the facility location problem, the approach developed here is general and
explores a new perspective on the exploitation of past experience in

(like gaussians), the ML-based WDP cannot be solved for large domains. While
linear or quadratic kernels have better computational scalability, these
kernels have limited expressiveness. In this work, we address these
shortcomings by using deep neural networks (DNNs) instead of SVRs. We first
show how the DNN-based WDP can be reformulated into a mixed integer program
(MIP). Second, we experimentally compare the prediction performance of DNNs
against SVRs. Third, we present experimental evaluations in two medium-sized
domains which show that even ICAs based on relatively small-sized DNNs lead to
higher economic efficiency than ICAs based on kernelized SVRs. Finally, we show

an improved description, in the cage context, of both the phonons and crystal
field contributions to the specific heat. The antiferromagnetic transition is
characterized as first-order and its latent heat determined. From the phonons
dispersion for a cage compound, the lattice specific heat contribution is
derived from the LaB6 data. Once corrected for the first-order transition and
lattice contributions, the magnetic entropy displays the characteristic plateau
of the quadruplet crystal field ground state, but at temperatures in excess of
30 K. Below 30 K, as the ordering temperature is approached, the magnetic
entropy is substantially reduced. This anomalous temperature dependence is
consistent with a crystal field ground state split by the rare-earth movement,
a phenomenon specific to rare-earth cage compounds.

Unfortunately, it also restricts the macroscopic Poisson's ratio and therefore
narrows its applicability. The paper studies the Poisson's ratio of a discrete
model analytically. It derives theoretical limits for cases where the geometry
of the model is completely arbitrary, but isotropic in the statistical sense.
It is shown that the widest limits are obtained for models where normal
directions of contacts between discrete units are parallel with the vectors
connecting these units. Any deviation from parallelism causes the limits to
shrink. A comparison of the derived equations to the results of the actual
numerical model is presented. It shows relatively large deviations from the
theory because the fundamental assumptions behind the theoretical derivations
are largely violated in systems with complex geometry. The real shrinking of
the Poisson's ratio limit is less severe compared to that which is

thermalization and nearly ideal equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation.
However, they are inherently driven-dissipative systems that can exhibit an
intricate interplay between the thermalizing influence of the environment given
by the dye solution and the pump and loss processes driving the system out of
equilibrium. We show that this interplay gives rise to a robust mechanism for
two-mode emission, when the system is driven by an off-centered pump beam.
Namely, after the system starts lasing in the dominantly pumped excited mode,
in a second transition a photon condensate is formed in the ground mode, when
the pump power is increased further. This effect is a consequence of the
redistribution of excited dye molecules via the lasing mode in combination with
thermalization. We propose to exploit this effect for engineering controlled
two-mode emission and demonstrate that by tailoring the transverse potential
landscape for the photons, the threshold pump power can be tuned by orders of
magnitude.

Relevant features of the distribution are represented by vertices, edges and

paths play a central role in these models because they determine the
independence relationships among variables. However, while a theory of path
coefficients is available in models for directed graphs, little has been
investigated about the strength of the association represented by a path in an
undirected graph. Essentially, it has been shown that the covariance between
two variables can be decomposed into a sum of weights associated with each of
the paths connecting the two variables in the corresponding concentration
graph. In this context, we consider concentration graph models and provide an
extensive analysis of the properties of path weights and their interpretation.
More specifically, we give an interpretation of covariance weights through
their factorisation into a partial covariance and an inflation factor. We then
extend the covariance decomposition over the paths of an undirected graph to
other measures of association, such as the marginal correlation coefficient and
a quantity that we call the inflated correlation. The usefulness of these

this framework is frequently used. In the present work we go one step beyond
this description by quantising both the scalar field and the scale factor of
the universe. Employing the Lorentzian path integral formulation of
semi-classical gravity we restrict to a simplified minisuperspace setting by
considering homogeneous transitions. This approach allows us to determine the
dominant geometry and inflaton evolution contributing to such amplitudes. We
find that for precisely specified initial scale factor and inflaton values (and
uncertain momenta), two distinct saddle point geometries contribute to the
amplitude, leading to interference effects. However, when the momenta of both
scale factor and inflaton are specified with sufficient certainty, only a
single saddle point is relevant and QFT in curved spacetime is applicable. In
particular we find that for inflaton transitions up the potential, meaningful
results are only obtained when the initial uncertainty in the inflaton value is
large enough, allowing the dominant evolution to be a complexified slow-roll
solution \emph{down} from a comparatively unlikely position higher up in the

Attacks with Generative Adversarial Networks (UAA-GAN) to attack deep
feature-based image retrieval systems. UAA-GAN is an unsupervised learning
model that requires only a small amount of unlabeled data for training. Once
trained, it produces query-specific perturbations for query images to form
adversarial queries. The core idea is to ensure that the attached perturbation
is barely perceptible to human yet effective in pushing the query away from its
original position in the deep feature space. UAA-GAN works with various
application scenarios that are based on deep features, including image
retrieval, person Re-ID and face search. Empirical results show that UAA-GAN
cripples retrieval performance without significant visual changes in the query
images. UAA-GAN generated adversarial examples are less distinguishable because
they tend to incorporate subtle perturbations in textured or salient areas of
the images, such as key body parts of human, dominant structural
patterns/textures or edges, rather than in visually insignificant areas (e.g.,
background and sky). Such tendency indicates that the model indeed learned how
to toy with both image retrieval systems and human eyes.

characteristic lengthscales in the interparticle interactions. To be more
precise, for stable quasicrystals, periodic modulations of the local density
distribution with two particular wavenumbers should be favored, and the ratio
of these wavenumbers should be close to certain special values. So, for simple
models, the answer to the title question is that only these two ingredients are

means of classical resources only, we fully characterize the set of such

guarantee the classicality of observed phenomena and furthermore derive an
experimentally and computationally accessible measure for non-classicality in

been the work by Barghathi and Vojta, which uses spatial correlations to
explain puzzling earlier results. However, due to its reliance on coordination
number fluctuations, their criterion cannot be applied to constant-coordination
lattices, raising the question, for which classes of transitions this type of
disorder can be a relevant perturbation. In order to cast light on this
question, we investigate the non-equilibrium phase transition of the
two-dimensional contact process on different types of spatial random graphs
with varying or constant coordination number. Using large-scale numerical
simulations, we find the disorder to be relevant, as the dynamical scaling
behaviour turns out to be non-conventional, thus ruling out the directed
percolation universality class. We conjecture that the relevance of topological
disorder is linked to how strongly connected the lattice is. Based on this
assumption, we design two analysis tools that succeed in qualitatively
distinguishing relevant from non-relevant topological disorders, supporting our
conjecture and possibly pointing the way to a more complete relevance
criterion.

provided evidence for game-making environments for girls. Subsequently, the
results contributed to the development of new featured games to be used in our

represented on unstructured grids. Approaches utilizing tensor decompositions
for data compression have already been proposed. Here, data on a structured
grid is stored as a tensor which is then subjected to appropriate decomposition
in suitable tensor formats. Such decompositions are based on generalization of
singular value decomposition to tensors and capture essential features in the
data with storage cost lower by orders of magnitude. However, tensor based data
compression is limited by the fact that one can only consider scientific data
represented on structured grids. In case of data on unstructured meshes, we
propose to consider data as realizations of a function that is based on
functional view of the tensor thus avoiding such limitations. The key is to
efficiently estimate the parameters of the function whose complexity is small
compared to the cardinality of the dataset (otherwise there is no compression).
Here, we introduce the set of functional sparse Tucker tensors and propose a
method to construct approximation in this set such that the resulting compact
functional tensor can be rapidly evaluated to recover the original data. The
compression procedure consists of three steps. In the first step, we consider a
fraction of the original dataset for interpolation on a structured grid
followed by sequentially truncated higher order singular value decomposition to
get a compressed version of the interpolated data.We then fit singular vectors
on a set of functional basis using sparse approximation to obtain corresponding
functional sparse Tucker tensor representation. Finally, we re-evaluate the
coefficients of this functional tensor using randomized least squares at a
reduced computational complexity. This strategy leads to compression ratio of
orders of magnitude on combustion simulation datasets.

The suitability and the scalability of the CBR-based reconfiguration strategy

considering a time-varying EoS of DE via Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)

using the data from cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO), the local value of Hubble constant from Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), and large scale structure (LSS) information from the abundance
of galaxy clusters, in four different combinations. We find that in the present

The constraints on the DM-photon coupling parameter do not reflect any
significant deviation from the previous results. Due to the decay of DM into
photons, we obtain higher values of $H_0$, consistent with the local
measurements, similar to our previous study. But, the time-varying DE leads to
lower values of $\sigma_8$ in the DM-photon coupling model with all data

allowing time-varying DE in the DM-photon coupling scenario is useful to

space of information, where the capacity, robustness and efficiency of the
memory are closely related with the complexity, generalization and
disentanglement of deep networks. The key components of this understanding
include:(1) a Fisher metric based formulation of the network complexity; (2)the
least action (complexity=action) principle on deep networks and (3)the geometry
built on deep network configurations. We will show how this picture will bring

  Learning based Recommendation","Appears in KDD 2019",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement learning aims at searching the best policy model for decision
making, and has been shown powerful for sequential recommendations. The
training of the policy by reinforcement learning, however, is placed in an
environment. In many real-world applications, however, the policy training in
the real environment can cause an unbearable cost, due to the exploration in
the environment. Environment reconstruction from the past data is thus an
appealing way to release the power of reinforcement learning in these
applications. The reconstruction of the environment is, basically, to extract
the casual effect model from the data. However, real-world applications are
often too complex to offer fully observable environment information. Therefore,
quite possibly there are unobserved confounding variables lying behind the
data. The hidden confounder can obstruct an effective reconstruction of the
environment. In this paper, by treating the hidden confounder as a hidden
policy, we propose a deconfounded multi-agent environment reconstruction
(DEMER) approach in order to learn the environment together with the hidden
confounder. DEMER adopts a multi-agent generative adversarial imitation
learning framework. It proposes to introduce the confounder embedded policy,
and use the compatible discriminator for training the policies. We then apply
DEMER in an application of driver program recommendation. We firstly use an
artificial driver program recommendation environment, abstracted from the real
application, to verify and analyze the effectiveness of DEMER. We then test
DEMER in the real application of Didi Chuxing. Experiment results show that
DEMER can effectively reconstruct the hidden confounder, and thus can build the
environment better. DEMER also derives a recommendation policy with a
significantly improved performance in the test phase of the real application.

later vanishes somewhere in between infinite distance from the attracter to the
event horizon of the same. For sustainability of a physical solutions, the
numerator should vanish at the same radial distance where denominator does
vanish. From this point, we obtain a second degree first order differential
equation of radial inward speed and hence we obtain two branches of flow,

formed to be more or less parallel to the radial distance axis as we move far
from the central object. For dark energy accretion, this curve is parallel to
the radial velocity axis. Here we face a question. Why there is no fluid speed
profiles in between these two extremities. While searching the reasons, we
follow that dark energy, if treated as an accreting object, should stay around
the central \emph{compact star} and hence will contaminate the metric which
propertises the compact star. In this research work, we have proposed a model
with a rotating black hole embedded in quintessence where quintessence equation

adjusting spectrum sensing time with respect to imposed target probabilities of

one-to-many mapping of vertex onto dimer configurations allows for the solution
of the free-fermion model to be applied to the anisotropic dimer model on a
square lattice where the dimers are rotated by $45\degree$ compared to their
usual orientation. In a suitable gauge, the dimer model is described by the
Temperley-Lieb algebra with loop fugacity $\beta=2\cos\lambda=0$. It follows
that the model is exactly solvable in geometries of arbitrary finite size. We
establish and solve transfer matrix inversion identities on the strip with
arbitrary finite width $N$. In the continuum scaling limit, in sectors with
magnetization $S_z$, we obtain the conformal weights
$\Delta_{s}=\big((2-s)^2-1\big)/8$ where $s=|S_z|+1=1,2,3,\ldots$. We further
show that the corresponding finitized characters $\chit_s^{(N)}(q)$ decompose

there exist nontrivial Jordan blocks of rank 2 in the Virasoro dilatation
operator $L_0$. This confirms that, with quantum group invariant boundary
conditions, the dimer model gives rise to a {\em logarithmic} conformal field

due to their good performance and fast speed. However, they lack effective ways
to adapt to changes in the target object's appearance, making their tracking
accuracy still far from state-of-the-art. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
memory network to adapt the template to the target's appearance variations
during tracking. The reading and writing process of the external memory is
controlled by an LSTM network with the search feature map as input. A spatial
attention mechanism is applied to concentrate the LSTM input on the potential
target as the location of the target is at first unknown. To prevent aggressive
model adaptivity, we apply gated residual template learning to control the
amount of retrieved memory that is used to combine with the initial template.
In order to alleviate the drift problem, we also design a ""negative"" memory
unit that stores templates for distractors, which are used to cancel out wrong
responses from the object template. To further boost the tracking performance,
an auxiliary classification loss is added after the feature extractor part.
Unlike tracking-by-detection methods where the object's information is
maintained by the weight parameters of neural networks, which requires
expensive online fine-tuning to be adaptable, our tracker runs completely
feed-forward and adapts to the target's appearance changes by updating the
external memory. Moreover, the capacity of our model is not determined by the
network size as with other trackers --- the capacity can be easily enlarged as
the memory requirements of a task increase, which is favorable for memorizing
long-term object information. Extensive experiments on the OTB and VOT datasets
demonstrate that our trackers perform favorably against state-of-the-art
tracking methods while retaining real-time speed.

finding (MAPF) solver fully integrated with the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland

modulo theories (SMT). The task in MAPF is to navigate agents in an undirected
graph in a non-colliding way so that each agent eventually reaches its unique
goal vertex. At most one agent can reside in a vertex at a time. Agents can
move instantaneously by traversing edges provided the movement does not result
in a collision. Recently attempts to solve MAPF optimally w.r.t. the
sum-of-costs or the makespan based on the reduction of MAPF to propositional
satisfiability (SAT) have appeared. The most successful methods rely on
building the propositional encoding for the given MAPF instance lazily by a
process inspired in the SMT paradigm. The integration of satisfiability testing
by the SAT solver and the high-level construction of the encoding is however
relatively loose in existing methods. Therefore the ultimate goal of research
in this direction is to build the DPLL(MAPF) algorithm, a MAPF solver where the
construction of the encoding is fully integrated with the underlying SAT
solver. We discuss the current state-of-the-art in MAPF solving and what steps
need to be done to get DPLL(MAPF). The advantages of DPLL(MAPF) in terms of its
potential to be alternatively parametrized with MAPF$^R$, a theory of
continuous MAPF with geometric agents, are also discussed.

properties in the THz frequency range. The graphene quantum dot (GQD) is made
of electrically gated stripe with zigzag edges. Inside the active region (AR),
which is enclosed between the source and drain electrodes, there are two sharp
energy ($\pm $)-levels, whose separation $2\Delta $ is controlled with Stark
effect by applying the lateral dc electric field. Such the edge states
determine the unique nature of elementary excitations, chiral fermions, that
are responsible for the non-linear optical responce revealing a potential for
many applications. They are, e.g., the frequency multiplication and
self-focusing of two dimensional solitons. Furthemore, when injection of the
non-equilibrium electrons causes an inverse population of the levels localized
in AR, the subsequent recombination of electrons and holes leads to a coherent
emission of the THz waves.

widespread use in many application domains. Despite outstanding progress,
quantitative evaluation of such models often involves multiple distinct metrics
to assess different desirable properties, such as image quality, conditional
consistency, and intra-conditioning diversity. In this setting, model
benchmarking becomes a challenge, as each metric may indicate a different
""best"" model. In this paper, we propose the Frechet Joint Distance (FJD), which
is defined as the Frechet distance between joint distributions of images and
conditioning, allowing it to implicitly capture the aforementioned properties
in a single metric. We conduct proof-of-concept experiments on a controllable
synthetic dataset, which consistently highlight the benefits of FJD when
compared to currently established metrics. Moreover, we use the newly
introduced metric to compare existing cGAN-based models for a variety of
conditioning modalities (e.g. class labels, object masks, bounding boxes,
images, and text captions). We show that FJD can be used as a promising single
metric for cGAN benchmarking and model selection. Code can be found at

free-standing 100 $\mu$m-long thin-film acoustic resonator to modulate light
travelling in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer or racetrack cavity. Owing to the
strong microwave-to-acoustic coupling offered by the transducer in conjunction
with the strong photoelastic, piezoelectric, and electro-optic effects of
lithium niobate, we achieve a half-wave voltage of $V_\pi$ = 4.6 V and $V_\pi$
= 0.77 V for the Mach-Zehnder interferometer and racetrack resonator,
respectively. The acousto-optic racetrack cavity exhibits an optomechancial
single-photon coupling strength of 1.1 kHz. Our integrated nanophotonic
platform coherently leverages the compelling properties of lithium niobate to
achieve microwave-to-optical transduction. To highlight the versatility of our
system, we also demonstrate a lossless microwave photonic link, which refers to
a 0 dB microwave power transmission over an optical channel.

We

We formulate three sets of research questions, define inclusion and exclusion
criteria and systematically identify themes for the classification of existing
techniques. We also report the quality of the published works using established
assessment criteria. we finally selected 37 papers out of 1654 based on our
selection criteria up to January 2019. We analyze trends such as contribution
facet, research facet, test approach, type of ML and the kind of testing with
several other attributes. We also discuss the empirical evidence and reporting
quality of selected papers. The data from the study is made publicly available
for other researchers and practitioners. We present an overview of the area by
answering several research questions. The area is growing rapidly, however,
there is lack of enough empirical evidence to compare and assess the
effectiveness of the techniques. More publicly available tools are required for
use of practitioners and researchers. Further attention is needed on
non-functional testing and testing of ML programs using reinforcement learning.
We believe that this study can help researchers and practitioners to obtain an
overview of the area and identify several sub-areas where more research is
required

error-prone. Especially for time-series data, which is common in Activity
Recognition, synchronizing several independently recorded sensors is
challenging. Adding second level evidence, like video recordings from multiple
angles and time-coded annotations, further complicates the matter of curating
such data. A possible alternative is to make use of standardized multi-media
formats. Sensor data can be encoded in audio format, and time-coded
information, like annotations, as subtitles. Video data can be added easily.
All this media can be merged into a single container file, which makes the
issue of synchronization explicit. The incurred performance overhead by this
encoding is shown to be negligible and compression can be applied to optimize
storage and transmission overhead.

diffusion and electromigration and tracks the gradient of ionic concentration
throughout the entire cycle of pulse-rest as a critical measure for
heterogeneous evolution. In particular, the framework incorporates the Brownian
motion of the ions and investigates the role of the geometry of the

analytical developments, where the the dimension-free developments allows the
