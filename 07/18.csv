coherence time of up to one second as well as a level structure offering the
possibility to initialize, coherently manipulate and optically read-out the
spin degree of freedom of the ground state. However, only about three percent
of their photon emission are channeled into the zero phonon line (ZPL),
limiting both the rate of indistinguishable single photons and the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of coherent spin-photon interfaces. We here report
on the enhancement of the SNR of the optical spin read-out achieved by tuning
the mode of a two-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC)cavity into resonance with
the NV-ZPL. PhC cavities are fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) milling in
thin reactive ion (RIE) etched ultrapure single crystal diamond membranes
featuring modes with Q-factors of up to 8250 at mode volumes below one cubic
wavelength. NV centers are produced in the cavities in a controlled fashion by
a high resolution atomic force microscope (AFM) implantation technique. On
cavity resonance we observe a lifetime shortening from 9.0ns to 8.0ns as well
as an enhancement of the ZPL emission by almost one order of magnitude.
Although on resonance the collection efficiency of ZPL photons and the
spin-dependent fluorescence contrast are reduced, the SNR of the optical spin
read-out is almost tripled for the cavity-coupled NV centers.

transportation discipline has entered the era of big data. It brings out new
opportunities for doing data-driven analysis, but it also challenges
traditional analytic methods. This paper proposes a new Divide and Combine
based approach to do K means clustering on activity-travel behavior time series
using features that are derived using tools in Time Series Analysis and
Topological Data Analysis. Clustering data from five waves of the National
Household Travel Survey ranging from 1990 to 2017 suggests that activity-travel
patterns of individuals over the last three decades can be grouped into three
clusters. Results also provide evidence in support of recent claims about
differences in activity-travel patterns of different survey cohorts. The
proposed method is generally applicable and is not limited only to
activity-travel behavior analysis in transportation studies. Driving behavior,
travel mode choice, household vehicle ownership, when being characterized as
categorical time series, can all be analyzed using the proposed method.

increasingly popular paradigm for people to consume video contents. Clickbait
video, whose content clearly deviates from its title/thumbnail, has emerged as
a critical problem on online video sharing platforms. Current clickbait
detection solutions that mainly focus on analyzing the text of the title, the
image of the thumbnail, or the content of the video are shown to be suboptimal
in detecting the online clickbait videos. In this paper, we develop a novel
content-agnostic scheme, Online Video Clickbait Protector (OVCP), to
effectively detect clickbait videos by exploring the comments from the audience
who watched the video. Different from existing solutions, OVCP does not
directly analyze the content of the video and its pre-click information (e.g.,
title and thumbnail). Therefore, it is robust against sophisticated content
creators who often generate clickbait videos that can bypass the current
clickbait detectors. We evaluate OVCP with a real-world dataset collected from
YouTube. Experimental results demonstrate that OVCP is effective in identifying
clickbait videos and significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art baseline
models and human annotators.

The resulting effective field theory (EFT) is called Higgs-Electroweak Chiral

in the Higgs sector. It solely assumes the pattern of symmetry breaking leading
to the three electroweak Goldstone bosons (i.e. massive $W$ and $Z$) and the
existence of a Higgs-like scalar particle. The power counting of the
EWCh$\mathcal{L}$ is given by a generalization of the momentum expansion of
ChPT. It is connected to a loop expansion, making the theory renormalizable
order by order in the EFT.
  I will briefly review the construction of the EWCh$\mathcal{L}$ and its power
counting. Then, I will discuss the complete one-loop renormalization of the
EWCh$\mathcal{L}$ employing the background-field method and the

analyzed to improve the reliability of the detection and the robustness in the
characterization of clusters and voids. We do this by adapting Big-Data

  Finally, as preferential concentration is known to depend on multiple
parameters, we performed experiments where one parameter was varied and all
others were kept constant ($\phi_v$, Reynolds number based on the Taylor length
scale $Re_\lambda$, and residence time of the particles interacting with the
turbulence). Our results confirm, in agreement with published work, that
clustering increases with both $\phi_v$ and $Re_\lambda$. On the other hand, we
find new evidence that the mean size of clusters increases with $Re_\lambda$

affected by $Re_\lambda$ up to the maximum value studied here, $Re_\lambda =

also used SIMBA (250 GHz) observations, and Herschel and WISE ancillary data.
The association with WISE red sources allowed the protostellar and starless

temperature to be derived for a fraction of cores. The protostellar and
starless core mass functions (CMFs) were constructed following two different
approaches, achieving a mass completeness limit of 3.7 Msun. Results We
retrieved 549 submillimetre cores, 316 of which are starless and mostly
gravitationally bound (therefore prestellar in nature). Both the protostellar

function in the high-mass part of the distribution. Clustering of cores at

degraded and non-degraded samples were generally consistent with trends
observed in the literature, but a subset of conditions showed significant
deviation in the slope increment (drag reduction performance) between the
degraded and non-degraded samples. When they deviated, the degraded samples
were consistently more efficient than the non-degraded samples even though they
had the same mean molecular weight. The deviations were shown to scale with the
normalized difference between the initial and final molecular weights. The
current data and analysis as well as the literature suggests that the
deviations in the polymer performance (slope increment) are related to changes
in the molecular weight distribution. More specifically, the improved
performance of the degraded samples relative to the non-degraded ones at the
mean molecular weight of the degraded sample indicates an excess of longer
polymer chains since the higher chain fractions in a degraded solution more
effectively control the flow properties when within a certain degree of
degradation and Reynolds number.

The model accommodates, as a consequence of the symmetry-breaking pattern, a
light gauge boson at the GeV-scale or below, allowing then to set up a new low
energy physics. The fermion sector includes an exotic candidate to Dark Matter
(DM) and the whole fermionic field content yields, as it is mandatory, the
cancellation of the chiral anomaly. %In this strict sense, we refer to our
proposal as a unified description : two different and exclusive
symmetry-breaking patterns are treated with a single Lagrangian density and a
common symmetry group. Furthermore, The light gauge boson and the exotic
fermion are proposed as candidates to the so-called dark sector of the model
that we try to describe in this contribution. The low-energy spectrum exhibits
a hidden scalar field with mass fixed at the GeV level in the Higgs sector. We
calculate the DM relic density associated with the dark fermion candidate by
considering two annihilation processes in which the light gauge boson works as
a portal for the DM detection. The observed relic density points to a mass of
$3.4$ GeV for the DM fermion, while the light gauge boson mass is $8.0$ GeV. We
also investigate the direct detection of DM in the low energy regime and obtain
the region of parameters allowed by recent discussions on DM limits. Finally,
the correction to the muon magnetic dipole moment is calculated considering the
gauge boson mass at the GeV scale or below.

observational data to constrain the curvature density parameter are premised on
the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, or extensions thereof. On the other hand, fitting
the data to models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state can, in
some cases, accommodate a non-flat Universe. Several authors caution that if
the assumption of spatial flatness is wrong, it could veer any efforts to
construct a dark energy model completely off course, even if the curvature is
in reality very small. We thus consider a number of alternative dynamical dark
energy models that represent the complete cosmological scenario, and
investigate the effects of spatial curvature on the evolution. We find that for
a closed Universe, the transition to the epoch of decelerated expansion would
be delayed with respect to the flat case. So would the start of the current
dark energy-dominated era. This would be accompanied by a larger inflationary
acceleration, as well as a larger subsequent deceleration. The opposite
behavior is observed if the Universe is open.

from the interface possess a photon spin transverse to its propagation, opening
exciting opportunities for observation of spin dependent unidirectional

spin (T-spin) in the interior of a bulk medium, without relying on the presence
of any interfaces. We show the complete mapping of the T-spin of surface modes
to that of the bulk modes by introducing the coupling between electric and

such extremely low-mass WDs cannot be formed in isolation within the age of the

truncated evolution of the WD progenitor. However, the observed orbit of the

necessary and sufficient conditions to recognize regions constructed by stable

interpreted in the framework of variant axion models, which require two Higgs
doublets and flavor-dependent Peccei-Quinn charge assignments. These models
resolve two fundamental issues faced in the traditional KSVZ/DFSZ models by
predicting a sizable axion coupling to electrons required to explain the
cooling anomalies and at the same time providing a solution to the cosmological

rotationally-induced dredge-up of nucleosynthetic products, mostly He and N, to
their surfaces while still on the MS. Non-rotating metal-rich stars also reveal
the products of nucleosynthesis on their surfaces because even modest amounts
of mass loss expose their ""fossil"" convective cores: regions that are no longer
convective, but which were part of the convective core at an early stage in the
star's evolution. Thus surface enhancement of He and N is expected for rotating
stars at all metallicities, and for non-rotating stars if they are relatively
metal-rich. We calculate a stellar atmosphere for a representative model from

to estimate a price range based on the profile characteristics of 3D printing

Data was gathered from existing marketplace websites, which was then used to
train and test the model. The model demonstrates an accuracy of 65% for US

Printer listing in one of the seven price categories. The improvement over
baseline accuracy of 25% demonstrates that machine learning based methods are
promising for network based pricing in manufacturing marketplaces. Conventional
methodologies for pricing services through activity based costing are
inefficient in strategically pricing 3D printing service offering in a

proposes an approach to determine prices through data mining methods to

$M=2.08^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, in $\approx 2.4\sigma$ tension with the independent

was hierarchically assembled from the accretion and disruption of smaller
systems. This hierarchical assembly is expected to produce a high degree of
structure in the combined phase and chemistry space; this structure should
provide a relatively direct probe of the accretion history of our Galaxy.
Revealing this structure requires precise 3D positions (including distances),
3D velocities, and chemistry for large samples of stars. The Gaia satellite is
delivering proper motions and parallaxes for >1 billion stars to G~20. However,
radial velocities and metallicities will only be available to G~15, which is
insufficient to probe the outer stellar halo (>10 kpc). Moreover, parallaxes
will not be precise enough to deliver high-quality distances for stars beyond
~10 kpc. Identifying accreted systems throughout the stellar halo therefore
requires a large ground-based spectroscopic survey to complement Gaia. Here we
provide an overview of the H3 Stellar Spectroscopic Survey, which will deliver
precise stellar parameters and spectrophotometric distances for 200,000 stars
to r=18. Spectra are obtained with the Hectochelle instrument at the MMT, which
is configured for the H3 Survey to deliver resolution R~23,000 spectra covering
the wavelength range 5150A-5300A. The survey is optimized for stellar halo
science and therefore focuses on high Galactic latitude fields (|b|>30 deg.),
sparsely sampling 15,000 sq. degrees. Targets are selected on the basis of Gaia
parallaxes, enabling very efficient selection of bone fide halo stars. The

of the data, including the derived stellar parameters, will eventually be made

through a model-independent parametrization of a Hubble Diagram of supernovae
Ia (SNe Ia) from the JLA survey and quasars. Model-independent approaches and
independent samples over a wide redshift range are key to testing this tension

Diagram of SNe Ia, quasars, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to check the agreement
of the quasar and GRB cosmological parameters at high redshifts (z>2) and to
test the concordance flat {\Lambda}CDM model with improved statistical
accuracy. We build a Hubble diagram with SNe Ia from the Pantheon sample
(Scolnic et al. 2018), quasars from the Risaliti & Lusso (2019) sample, and
GRBs from the Demianski et al. (2017a) sample, where quasars are standardised
through the observed non-linear relation between their ultraviolet and X-ray
emission and GRBs through the correlation between the spectral peak energy and
the isotropic-equivalent radiated energy (the so-called ""Amati relation""). We
fit the data with cosmographic models consisting of a fourth-order logarithmic
polynomial and a fifth-order linear polynomial, and compare the results with
the expectations from a flat {\Lambda}CDM model. We confirm the tension between
the best fit cosmographic parameters and the {\Lambda}CDM model at ~4{\sigma}
with SNe Ia and quasars, at ~2{\sigma} with SNe Ia and GRBs, and at >4{\sigma}
with the whole SNe Ia+quasars+GRB data set. The completely independent
high-redshift Hubble diagrams of quasars and GRBs are fully consistent with
each other, strongly suggesting that the deviation from the standard model is
not due to unknown systematic effects but to new physics.

constant and weak hierarchy problems, as well as the metastability of the
electroweak vacuum, can all be understood as problems of criticality. This
suggests a statistical physics approach, based on the string landscape. We
present a dynamical selection mechanism for hospitable vacua based on search
optimization. Instead of focusing on stationary probability distributions, we
are interested in the approach to equilibrium. This is particularly relevant if
cosmological evolution has occurred for a time shorter than the
exponentially-long mixing time for the landscape. This imposes a strong
selection pressure among hospitable vacua, favoring those in regions where the
search algorithm is efficient. Specifically, the mean first passage time is
minimized for hospitable vacua lying at the bottom of funnel-like regions, akin
to the smooth folding funnels of proteins and the loss functions of
well-trained deep neural networks. The optimality criterion is
time-reparametrization invariant and defined by two competing requirements:
search efficiency, which requires minimizing the mean first passage time, and
sweeping exploration, which requires that random walks are recurrent. Optimal
landscape regions reach a compromise by lying at the critical boundary between
recurrence and transience, thereby achieving dynamical criticality. Remarkably,
this implies that the optimal lifetime of vacua coincides with the de Sitter
Page time. Our mechanism makes concrete phenomenological predictions: 1. The
expected lifetime of our universe is $10^{130}$ years, which is ~$2\sigma$ from
the Standard Model metastability estimate; 2. The SUSY breaking scale should be
high, $>10^{10}$ GeV. The present framework suggests a correspondence between
the near-criticality of our universe and non-equilibrium critical phenomena on
the landscape.

in any previous line or continuum images of eta Carinae. This image shows
diffuse MgII emission immediately outside the bipolar Homunculus nebula in all
directions, but with the strongest emission concentrated over the poles. The
diffuse structure with prominent radial streaks, plus an anticorrelation with
ionized tracers of clumpy shocked gas, leads us to suggest that this is
primarily MgII resonant scattering from unshocked, neutral atomic gas. We
discuss the implied structure and geometry of the MgII emission, and its
relation to the Homunculus lobes and various other complex nebular structures.
An order of magnitude estimate of the neutral gas mass traced by MgII is
0.02Msun, with a corresponding kinetic energy around 1e47erg. This may provide
important constraints on polar mass loss in the early phases of the Great
Eruption. We argue that the MgII line may be an excellent tracer of significant
reservoirs of freely expanding, unshocked, and otherwise invisible neutral
atomic gas in a variety of stellar outflows.

maps from a (complete pointed) metric space $M$ to a Banach space $Y$ which
strongly attain their norm (i.e.\ the supremum defining the Lipschitz norm is
actually a maximum). We present new and somehow counterintuitive examples, and
we give some applications. First, we show that $\operatorname{SNA}(\mathbb
T,Y)$ is not dense in ${\mathrm{Lip}}_0(\mathbb T,Y)$ for any Banach space $Y$,
where $\mathbb T$ denotes the unit circle in the Euclidean plane. This provides
the first example of a Gromov concave metric space (i.e.\ every molecule is a
strongly exposed point of the unit ball of the Lipschitz-free space) for which
the density does not hold. Next, we construct metric spaces $M$ satisfying that
$\operatorname{SNA}(M,Y)$ is dense in ${\mathrm{Lip}}_0(M,Y)$ regardless $Y$
but which contains an isometric copy of $[0,1]$ and so the Lipschitz-free space
$\mathcal F(M)$ fails the Radon--Nikod\'{y}m property, answering in the
negative a posed question. Furthermore, an example $M$ can be produced failing
all the previously known sufficient conditions to get the density of strongly
norm attaining Lipschitz maps. Finally, among other applications, we prove that
given a compact metric $M$ which does not contains any isometric copy of
$[0,1]$ and a Banach space $Y$, if $\operatorname{SNA}(M,Y)$ is dense, then
$\operatorname{SNA}(M,Y)$ actually contains an open dense subset and
$B_{\mathcal F(M)}=\overline{{\mathrm{co}}}(\operatorname{str-exp}(B_{\mathcal

which $\operatorname{SNA}(M,\mathbb R)$ is dense in ${\mathrm{Lip}}_0(M,\mathbb

hull of its strongly exposed points.

(SSA) has often been identified as the cause of their spectral peak. The
identification of new megahertz-peaked spectrum sources from the GaLactic and
Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey provides an
opportunity to test how radio sources with spectral peaks below 1 GHz fit
within this evolutionary picture. We observed six peaked-spectrum sources
selected from the GLEAM survey, three that have spectral characteristics which
violate SSA and three that have spectral peaks below 230 MHz, with the Very
Long Baseline Array at 1.55 and 4.96 GHz. We present milliarcsecond resolution
images of each source and constrain their morphology, linear size, luminosity,
and magnetic field strength. Of the sources that are resolved by our study, the
sources that violate SSA appear to be compact doubles, while the sources with
peak frequencies below 230 MHz have core-jet features. We find that all of our
sources are smaller than expected from SSA by factors of >20. We also find that
component magnetic field strengths calculated from SSA are likely inaccurate,
differing by factors of >5 from equipartition estimates. The calculated
equipartition magnetic field strengths more closely resemble estimates from
previously studied gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. Exploring a model of the
interaction between jets and the interstellar medium, we demonstrate that
free-free absorption (FFA) can accurately describe the linear sizes and peak
frequencies of our sources. Our findings support the theory that there is a
fraction of peaked-spectrum sources whose spectral peaks are best modelled by
FFA, implying our understanding of the early stages of radio AGN is incomplete.

some span hundreds of pc in length. Most of these string lack a central

the result of tidal stripping or dynamical processing. The youngest strings

remnants of several other arm-like structures that cannot be presently traced
by dust and gas. The velocity dispersion measured from the ensemble of groups
and strings increase with age, suggesting a timescale for dynamical heating of
$\sim$300 Myr. This timescale is also consistent with the age at which the
population of strings begins to decline, while the population in more compact
groups continues to increase, suggesting that dynamical processes are
disrupting the weakly bound string populations, leaving only individual
clusters to be identified at the oldest ages. These data shed a new light on

been proposed by Giacalone & Jokipii (2015) to be important in determining the
structure of the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) ribbon via particle
trapping by magnetic mirroring. We further explore this effect by simulating
the motion of charged particles in a turbulent magnetic field superposed on a
large-scale mean field, which we have considered to be either spatially-uniform
or a mean field derived from a 3D MHD simulation. We find that the ribbon is
not double-peaked, in contrast to Giacalone & Jokipii (2015). However, the
magnetic mirror force still plays an important role in trapping particles.
Furthermore, the ribbon$'$s thickness is considerably larger if the large-scale
mean field is draped around the heliosphere. Voyager 1 observations in the
VLISM show a turbulent field component that is stronger than previously
thought, which we test in our simulation. We find that the inclusion of
turbulent fluctuations at scales ${\gtrsim}$100 au and power consistent with
Voyager 1 observations produces a ribbon whose large-scale structure is
inconsistent with IBEX observations. However, restricting the fluctuations to
${\sim}$10 au or smaller produces a smoother ribbon structure similar to IBEX
observations. Different turbulence realizations produce different small-scale
features ${\lesssim}10{\deg}$ in the ribbon, but its large-scale structure is
robust if the maximum fluctuation size is ${\sim}$10 au. This suggests that the
magnetic field structure at scales ${\lesssim}$10 au is determined by the
heliosphere$'$s interaction with the VLISM and cannot entirely be represented
by homogeneous interstellar turbulence.

of struggling search. Related research has targeted key aspects of users such
as user satisfaction or frustration, and search success or failure, using a
variety of experimental methods including laboratory user studies, in-situ
explicit feedback from searchers and by using crowdsourcing. Such studies are
valuable in advancing the understanding of search difficulty from a user's
perspective, and yield insights that can directly improve search systems and
their evaluation. However, little is known about how user moods influence their
interactions with a search system or their perception of struggling. In this
work, we show that a user's own mood can systematically bias the user's
perception, and experience while interacting with a search system and trying to
satisfy an information need. People who are in activated-pleasant /
activated-unpleasant moods tend to issue more queries than people in
deactivated or neutral moods. Those in an unpleasant mood perceive a higher
level of difficulty. Our insights extend the current understanding of
struggling search tasks and have important implications on the design and
evaluation of search systems supporting such tasks.

the advertisers' envy, which can be computed with one single execution of the

great impact on electricity consumption, and uncoordinated charging process
will add load uncertainty and further complicate the grid scheduling. In this
paper, we propose a smart charging approach that uses the flexibility of EV
owners to absorb the fluctuations in the output of RES in a vehicle-to-grid

aggregated EV fleets to maximize the integration of wind generation as well as
minimize the charging cost for EV owners. Challenges for people participation

every parameter of the model is known a day ahead of scheduling. Subsequently,
we formulate a dynamic (dis)charging schedule after EVs arrive into the system
with updated information about EV availabilities, wind generation forecast, and
energy price in real-time, using rolling-horizon optimization. Simulations
using a group of 100 EVs in a micro-grid with wind as primary resource

find a sequential algorithm that can compete with, in a certain sense, the NE
of the long-term-averaged payoff matrix. We design an algorithm with small NE
regret--that is, we ensure that the long-term payoff of both players is close
to minimax optimum in hindsight. Our algorithm achieves near-optimal dependence
with respect to the number of rounds and depends poly-logarithmically on the
number of available actions of the players. Additionally, we show that the
naive reduction, where each player simply minimizes its own regret, fails to
achieve the stated objective regardless of which algorithm is used. We also

register multiple point sets via rigid transforms. This arises in applications
such as sensor network localization, multiview registration, and protein
structure determination. The least-squares estimator for this problem can be
reduced to a rank-constrained semidefinite program (REG-SDP). It was recently
shown that by formally applying the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM), we can derive an iterative solver (REG-ADMM) for REG-SDP, wherein each
subproblem admits a simple closed-form solution. The empirical success of
REG-ADMM has been demonstrated for multiview registration. However, its
convergence does not follow from the existing literature on nonconvex ADMM. In
this work, we study the convergence of REG-ADMM and our main findings are as
follows. We prove that any fixed point of REG-ADMM is a stationary (KKT) point
of REG-SDP. Moreover, for clean measurements, we give an explicit formula for
the ADMM parameter $\rho$, for which REG-ADMM is guaranteed to converge to the
global optimum (with arbitrary initialization). If the noise is low, we can
still show that the iterates converge to the global optimum, provided they are
initialized sufficiently close to the optimum. On the other hand, if the noise
is high, we explain why REG-ADMM becomes unstable if $\rho$ is less than some
threshold, irrespective of the initialization. We present simulation results to
support our theoretical predictions. The novelty of our analysis lies in the
fact that we exploit the notion of tightness of convex relaxation to arrive at
our convergence results.

Observatory (SWGO), a next-generation instrument with sensitivity to the
very-high-energy (VHE) band to be constructed in the Southern Hemisphere. SWGO
will provide wide-field coverage of a large portion of the southern sky,
effectively complementing current and future instruments in the global
multi-messenger effort to understand extreme astrophysical phenomena throughout
the universe. A detailed description of science topics addressed by SWGO is
available in the science case white paper [1]. The development of SWGO will
draw on extensive experience within the community in designing, constructing,
and successfully operating wide-field instruments using observations of
extensive air showers. The detector will consist of a compact inner array of
particle detection units surrounded by a sparser outer array. A key advantage
of the design of SWGO is that it can be constructed using current, already
proven technology. We estimate a construction cost of 54M USD and a cost of
7.5M USD for 5 years of operation, with an anticipated US contribution of 20M
USD ensuring that the US will be a driving force for the SWGO effort. The
recently formed SWGO collaboration will conduct site selection and detector
optimization studies prior to construction, with full operations foreseen to
begin in 2026. Throughout this document, references to science white papers
submitted to the Astro2020 Decadal Survey with particular relevance to the key

astronomical spectroscopy is rapidly approaching an impasse: the size and cost
of instruments, especially multi-object and integral field spectrographs for
extremely large telescopes (ELTs), are pushing the limits of what is feasible,
requiring optical components at the very edge of achievable size and
performance. For these reasons, astronomers are increasingly looking for
innovative solutions like photonic technologies that promote instrument
miniaturization and simplification, while providing superior performance.
  Astronomers have long been aware of the potential of photonic technologies.
The goal of this white paper is to draw attention to key photonic technologies
and developments over the past two decades and demonstrate there is new
momentum in this arena. We outline where the most critical efforts should be
focused over the coming decade in order to move towards realizing a fully
photonic instrument. A relatively small investment in this technology will
advance astronomical photonics to a level where it can reliably be used to
solve challenging instrument design limitations. For the benefit of both ground

due to the strong impact of combustion timing on efficiency. In this work, a
non-linear combustion phasing model is developed and integrated with a
cylinder-specific model of intake gas. The combustion phasing model uses a
knock integral model, a burn duration model and a Wiebe function to predict
CA50 (the crank angle at which 50% of the mass of fuel has burned). Meanwhile,
the intake gas property model predicts the EGR fraction and the in-cylinder
pressure and temperature at intake valve closing (IVC) for different cylinders.
As such, cylinder-to-cylinder variation of the pressure and temperature at
intake valves closing is also considered in this model. This combined model is
simplified for controller design and validated. Based on these models, two
combustion phasing control strategies are explored. The first is an adaptive
controller that is designed for closed-loop control and the second is a
feedforward model-based control strategy for open-loop control. These two
control approaches were tested in simulations for all six cylinders and the
results demonstrate that the CA50 can reach steady state conditions within 10
cycles. In addition, the steady state errors are less than +/-0.1 crank angle
degree (CAD) with the adaptive control approach, and less than +/-1.3 CAD with
feedforward model-based control. The impact of errors on the control algorithms

with such approaches is that the amount of training data required for

promising for non-stationary problems, but have not been as extensively

perform well, but in non-stationary prediction problems the meta-descent
methods exhibit advantages. Our method is particularly robust across several
prediction problems, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art method on a

systems such as fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics inspire further
investigation of these methods on complex engineered systems. Dynamics of these
systems play a crucial role in design and operations. Hence, it would be
advantageous to learn about the mechanisms that may be driving the complex
dynamics of systems. In this work, our research question was aimed at
addressing this open question about applicability and usefulness of novel
machine learning approach in identifying the governing dynamical equations for
engineered systems. We focused on distillation column which is an ubiquitous
unit operation in chemical engineering and demonstrates complex dynamics i.e.
it's dynamics is a combination of heuristics and fundamental physical laws. We
tested the method of Sparse Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy)
because of it's ability to produce white-box models with terms that can be used
for physical interpretation of dynamics. Time series data for dynamics was
generated from simulation of distillation column using ASPEN Dynamics. One
promising result was reduction of number of equations for dynamic simulation
from 1000s in ASPEN to only 13 - one for each state variable. Prediction
accuracy was high on the test data from system within the perturbation range,
however outside perturbation range equations did not perform well. In terms of
physical law extraction, some terms were interpretable as related to Fick's law
of diffusion (with concentration terms) and Henry's law (with ratio of
concentration and pressure terms). While some terms were interpretable, we
conclude that more research is needed on combining engineering systems with
machine learning approach to improve understanding of governing laws for
unknown dynamics.

planets with independent periods and sizes do not adequately account for the
properties of the multiplanet systems. Instead, a clustered point process model
for exoplanet periods and sizes provides a significantly better description of
the Kepler population, particularly the observed multiplicity and period ratio
distributions. We find that $0.56^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ of FGK stars have at least
one planet larger than $0.5 R_\oplus$ between 3 and 300 d. Most of these
planetary systems ($\sim 98\%$) consist of one or two clusters with a median of
three planets per cluster. We find that the Kepler dichotomy is evidence for a
population of highly inclined planetary systems and is unlikely to be solely

bandwidth is shared. Since increased number of requests from multiple cores of
processors becomes a source of bottleneck, scheduling the requests efficiently
is necessary to utilize all the computing power these processors offer.
However, current multicore processors are using traditional memory controllers,
which are designed for single-core processors. They are unable to adapt to
changing characteristics of memory workloads that run simultaneously on
multiple cores. Existing schedulers may disrupt locality and bank parallelism
among data requests coming from different cores. Hence, novel memory
controllers that consider and adapt to the memory access characteristics, and
share memory resources efficiently and fairly are necessary. We introduce
Core-Aware Dynamic Scheduler (CADS) for multicore memory controller. CADS uses
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to alter its scheduling strategy dynamically at
runtime. Our scheduler utilizes locality among data requests from multiple
cores and exploits parallelism in accessing multiple banks of DRAM. CADS is
also able to share the DRAM while guaranteeing fairness to all cores accessing
memory. Using CADS policy, we achieve 20% better cycles per instruction (CPI)
in running memory intensive and compute intensive PARSEC parallel benchmarks
simultaneously, and 16% better CPI with SPEC 2006 benchmarks.

vertical and horizontal circulation, interpretations of phase curves, and the

and O (sdO) stars. While the latter are predominantly hydrogen deficient, the
former are mostly helium deficient. The atmospheres of most sdOs are almost
devoid of hydrogen, whereas a small group of hot subdwarf stars of mixed H/He
composition exists, showing extreme metal abundance anomalies. Whether such
intermediate helium-rich (iHe) subdwarf stars provide an evolutionary link
between the dominant classes is an open question. The presence of strong Ge,
Sn, and Pb lines in the UV spectrum of HZ$\,$44 suggests a strong enrichment of
heavy elements in this iHe-sdO star and calls for a detailed quantitative
spectral analysis focusing on trans-iron elements. Non-LTE model atmospheres
calculated with TLUSTY are combined with high-quality optical, UV and FUV
spectra of HZ$\,$44 and its hotter sibling HD$\,$127493 to determine their
atmospheric parameters and metal abundance patterns. By collecting atomic data
from literature we succeeded to determine abundances of 29 metals in HZ$\,$44,
including the trans-iron elements Ga, Ge, As, Se, Zr, Sn, and Pb and provide
upper limits for 10 other metals. This makes it the best described hot subdwarf
in terms of chemical composition. For HD$\,$127493 the abundance of 15 metals,
including Ga, Ge, and Pb and upper limits for another 16 metals were derived.
Heavy elements turn out to be overabundant by one to four orders of magnitude
with respect to the Sun. Zr and Pb are among the most enriched elements. The C,
N, and O abundance for both stars can be explained by nucleosynthesis of
hydrogen burning in the CNO cycle along with their helium enrichment. On the
other hand, the heavy-element anomalies are unlikely to be caused by
nucleosynthesis. Instead diffusion processes are evoked with radiative
levitation overcoming gravitational settlement of the heavy elements.

modelled the observed magnon spectrum using linear spin wave analysis of a
minimal anisotropic spin model motivated by the lattice symmetry. By studying
the magnetic field dependence of the (1, 0, 0) Bragg peak intensity and the
in-plane magnon intensity, we observed a spin-flop transition in the $ab$ plane

anisotropy that is classically forbidden. It is only by taking into account
magnon zero-point fluctuations beyond the linear spin wave approximation, we
could explain this in-plane anisotropy and its magnitude, the latter of which
is deduced from critical field of the spin-flop transition. The microscopic
origins of the observed anisotropic interactions are also discussed. We found

concept of a genome-wide causation studies (GWCS) as an alternative to GWAS and
develop additive noise models (ANMs) for genetic causation analysis. Type I
error rates and power of the ANMs to test for causation are presented. We
conduct GWCS of schizophrenia. Both simulation and real data analysis show that
the proportion of the overlapped association and causation signals is small.
Thus, we hope that our analysis will stimulate discussion of GWAS and GWCS.

versions of Poincare duality for stratified spaces into a single theorem. This
unified duality theorem holds with ground coefficients in an arbitrary PID and
with no local cohomology conditions on the underlying space. In this paper we
consider for torsion sensitive intersection homology analogues of another
important property of classical intersection homology: topological invariance.
In other words, we consider to what extent the defining sheaf complexes of the
theory are independent (up to quasi-isomorphism) of choice of stratification.
In addition to providing torsion sensitive versions of the existing invariance
theorems for classical intersection homology, our techniques provide some new
results even in the classical setting.

Detecting hot corino-type chemistry in three of five sources represents a high

and this suggests a possible link between protostellar disk formation and hot
corino formation. For sources with CH3OH detections, we derive column densities
of 10^{17}-10^{18} cm^{-2} and rotational temperatures of ~200-250 K. The
CH3OH-normalized column density ratios of large, oxygen-bearing COMs in the
Serpens sources and other hot corinos span two orders of magnitude,
demonstrating a high degree of chemical diversity at the hot corino stage.
Resolved observations of a larger sample of objects are needed to understand
the origins of chemical diversity in hot corinos, and the relationship between
different protostellar structural elements on disk-forming scales.

safety of a self-driving car is still a challenging problem that has not been
well studied. Motion prediction is one of the core functions of an autonomous
driving car. Previously, we propose a novel scheme called GRIP which is
designed to predict trajectories for traffic agents around an autonomous car
efficiently. GRIP uses a graph to represent the interactions of close objects,
applies several graph convolutional blocks to extract features, and
subsequently uses an encoder-decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) model to
make predictions. Even though our experimental results show that GRIP improves
the prediction accuracy of the state-of-the-art solution by 30%, GRIP still has
some limitations. GRIP uses a fixed graph to describe the relationships between
different traffic agents and hence may suffer some performance degradations
when it is being used in urban traffic scenarios. Hence, in this paper, we
describe an improved scheme called GRIP++ where we use both fixed and dynamic
graphs for trajectory predictions of different types of traffic agents. Such an
improvement can help autonomous driving cars avoid many traffic accidents. Our
evaluations using a recently released urban traffic dataset, namely ApolloScape
showed that GRIP++ achieves better prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art
schemes. GRIP++ ranked #1 on the leaderboard of the ApolloScape trajectory
competition in October 2019. In addition, GRIP++ runs 21.7 times faster than a
state-of-the-art scheme, CS-LSTM.

facilities in the United States, and the problem of identifying facilities with
outcomes that are better than or worse than expected. Analyses of such data

shortcomings that can lead to unfair assessments. A primary issue is that they
do not appropriately account for variation between providers that is outside
the providers' control due, for example, to unobserved patient characteristics
that vary between providers. In this article, we propose a smoothed empirical
null approach that accounts for the total variation and adapts to different
provider sizes. The linear model provides an illustration that extends easily
to other nonlinear models for survival or binary outcomes, for example. The
empirical null method is generalized to allow for some variation being due to

  equations from limited noisy data","20 pages, 10 figures and supplementary material included",,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a statistical learning framework for robust identification of
partial differential equations from noisy spatiotemporal data. Extending
previous sparse regression approaches for inferring PDE models from simulated
data, we address key issues that have thus far limited the application of these
methods to noisy experimental data, namely their robustness against noise and
the need for manual parameter tuning. We address both points by proposing a
stability-based model selection scheme to determine the level of regularization
required for reproducible recovery of the underlying PDE. This avoids manual
parameter tuning and provides a principled way to improve the method's
robustness against noise in the data. Our stability selection approach, termed
PDE-STRIDE, can be combined with any sparsity-promoting penalized regression
model and provides an interpretable criterion for model component importance.
We show that in particular the combination of stability selection with the
iterative hard-thresholding algorithm from compressed sensing provides a fast,
parameter-free, and robust computational framework for PDE inference that
outperforms previous algorithmic approaches with respect to recovery accuracy,
amount of data required, and robustness to noise. We illustrate the performance
of our approach on a wide range of noise-corrupted simulated benchmark
problems, including 1D Burgers, 2D vorticity-transport, and 3D
reaction-diffusion problems. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our
method on real-world data by considering a purely data-driven re-evaluation of
the advective triggering hypothesis for an embryonic polarization system in
C.~elegans. Using fluorescence microscopy images of C.~elegans zygotes as input
data, our framework is able to recover the PDE model for the regulatory
reaction-diffusion-flow network of the associated proteins.

modelling and prediction using infinite-dimensional process models is not

spatial models to large data sets has been solved through the likes of
multi-resolution approximations and nearest-neighbour techniques. Here we
tackle the next challenge, that of fitting complex, nonstationary, multi-scale

superpositions of spatial processes with increasing spatial scale and
increasing degrees of nonstationarity. Computation is facilitated through the
use of Gaussian Markov random fields and parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo
based on graph colouring. The resulting model allows for both distributed
computing and distributed data. Importantly, it provides opportunities for
genuine model and data scaleability and yet is still able to borrow strength
across large spatial scales. We illustrate a two-scale version on a data set of
sea-surface temperature containing on the order of one million observations,

under Turing equivalence. Roughly speaking, given two such collections
$\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, $\mathcal{A}$ is below $\mathcal{B}$ in this
ordering if $\mathcal{A}\setminus\mathcal{B}$ is negligible. The degree
structure associated with this ordering, the Levin-V'yugin degrees (or
LV-degrees), can be shown to be a Boolean algebra, and in fact a measure

  We demonstrate the interactions of this work with recent results in
computability theory and algorithmic randomness: First, we recall the
definition of the Levin-V'yugin algebra and identify connections between its
properties and classical properties from computability theory. In particular,
we apply results on the interactions between notions of randomness and Turing
reducibility to establish new facts about specific LV-degrees, such as the
LV-degree of the collection of 1-generic sequences, that of the collection of
sequences of hyperimmune degree, and those collections corresponding to various
notions of effective randomness. Next, we provide a detailed explanation of a
complex technique developed by V'yugin that allows the construction of
semi-measures into which computability-theoretic properties can be encoded. We
provide two examples of the use of this technique by explicating a result of
V'yugin's about the LV-degree of the collection of Martin-L\""of random

LaH$_{10}$ at a critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ between 250${\sim}$260 K under
a pressure of about 170 GPa. However, the dependence of $T_{\rm c}$ on pressure
showed different patterns: i.e., the former experiment observed a continuous
increase of $T_{\rm c}$ up to ${\sim}$275 K on further increase of pressure to
202 GPa, while the latter one observed an abrupt decrease of $T_{\rm c}$ with
increasing pressure. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we reveal
that for the fcc-LaH$_{10}$ phase, softening of the low-frequency optical
phonon modes of H atoms dramatically occurs as pressure decreases, giving rise
to a significant increase of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant.
Meanwhile, the electronic band structure near the Fermi energy is insensitive
to change with respect to pressure. These results indicate that the
pressure-dependent phonon softening is unlikely associated with Fermi-surface
nesting, but driven by effective screening with the electronic states near the
Fermi energy. It is thus demonstrated that the strong variation of EPC with
respect to pressure plays a dominant role in the decrease of $T_{\rm c}$ with
increasing pressure, supporting the measurements of Drozdov $et$ $al$.

astrophysics for the next decade. Searches for technosignatures are
complementary to searches for biosignatures, in that they offer an alternative
path to discovery, and address the question of whether complex (i.e.
technological) life exists elsewhere in the Galaxy. This approach has been
endorsed in prior Decadal Reviews and National Academies reports, and yet the
field still receives almost no federal support in the US. Because of this lack
of support, searches for technosignatures, precisely the part of the search of
greatest public interest, suffers from a very small pool of trained
practitioners. A major source of this issue is institutional inertia at NASA,
which avoids the topic as a result of decades-past political grandstanding,
conflation of the effort with non-scientific topics such as UFOs, and confusion
regarding the scope of the term ""SETI."" The Astro2020 Decadal should address
this issue by making developing the field an explicit priority for the next
decade. It should recommend that NASA and the NSF support training and
curricular development in the field in a way that supports equity and
diversity, and make explicit calls for proposals to fund searches for
technosignatures.

  Expanders",,,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of approximately solving constraint satisfaction
problems with arity $k > 2$ ($k$-CSPs) on instances satisfying certain
expansion properties, when viewed as hypergraphs. Random instances of $k$-CSPs,
which are also highly expanding, are well-known to be hard to approximate using
known algorithmic techniques (and are widely believed to be hard to approximate
in polynomial time). However, we show that this is not necessarily the case for
instances where the hypergraph is a high-dimensional expander.
  We consider the spectral definition of high-dimensional expansion used by
Dinur and Kaufman [FOCS 2017] to construct certain primitives related to PCPs.
They measure the expansion in terms of a parameter $\gamma$ which is the
analogue of the second singular value for expanding graphs. Extending the
results by Barak, Raghavendra and Steurer [FOCS 2011] for 2-CSPs, we show that
if an instance of MAX k-CSP over alphabet $[q]$ is a high-dimensional expander
with parameter $\gamma$, then it is possible to approximate the maximum
fraction of satisfiable constraints up to an additive error $\epsilon$ using
$q^{O(k)} \cdot (k/\epsilon)^{O(1)}$ levels of the sum-of-squares SDP
hierarchy, provided $\gamma \leq \epsilon^{O(1)} \cdot (1/(kq))^{O(k)}$.
  Based on our analysis, we also suggest a notion of threshold-rank for
hypergraphs, which can be used to extend the results for approximating 2-CSPs
on low threshold-rank graphs. We show that if an instance of MAX k-CSP has
threshold rank $r$ for a threshold $\tau = (\epsilon/k)^{O(1)} \cdot
(1/q)^{O(k)}$, then it is possible to approximately solve the instance up to
additive error $\epsilon$, using $r \cdot q^{O(k)} \cdot (k/\epsilon)^{O(1)}$
levels of the sum-of-squares hierarchy. As in the case of graphs,
high-dimensional expanders (with sufficiently small $\gamma$) have threshold
rank 1 according to our definition.

we propose a regularized graph neural network (RGNN) for EEG-based emotion

regions to capture both local and global relations among different EEG

an adjacency matrix in a graph neural network where the connection and
sparseness of the adjacency matrix are inspired by neuroscience theories of
human brain organization. In addition, we propose two regularizers, namely
node-wise domain adversarial training (NodeDAT) and emotion-aware distribution
learning (EmotionDL), to better handle cross-subject EEG variations and noisy
labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, SEED and
SEED-IV, demonstrate the superior performance of our model than
state-of-the-art models in most experimental settings. Moreover, ablation
studies show that the proposed adjacency matrix and two regularizers contribute
consistent and significant gain to the performance of our RGNN model. Finally,
investigations on the neuronal activities reveal important brain regions and

multi-year historical data all together for forecast and achieved a superior
performance over various traditional methods by real-world tests. However, the
previous method only focused on the forecast of the next one-year. In our
current work, we significantly improved this method: the forecast can now be
extended to a multi-year forecast window in the future; unsupervised learning
techniques are used to group feeders by their load composition features to
improve accuracy; we also propose a novel selective sequence learning mechanism

sequence values but also learn to select the best-performing sequential

sensor's measurement transmission to the controller and the controller's
command transmission to the actuator. In this work, we consider a practical
half-duplex controller, which introduces a novel transmission-scheduling
problem for WNCSs. A frequent scheduling of sensor's transmission results in a
better estimation of plant states at the controller and thus a higher quality
of control command, but it leads to a less frequent/timely control of the
plant. Therefore, considering the overall control performance of the plant in
terms of its average cost function, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between
the sensor's and the controller's transmissions. We formulate a new problem to
optimize the transmission-scheduling policy for minimizing the long-term
average cost function. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition of the
existence of a stationary and deterministic optimal policy that results in a
bounded average cost in terms of the transmission reliabilities of the
sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels. Also, we derive an
easy-to-compute suboptimal policy, which notably reduces the average cost of
the plant compared to a naive alternative-scheduling policy.

Both Galerkin and Least-Squares Petrov Galerkin ROMs are shown to be less
robust in reacting flows as compared to non-reacting flows. In particular,
reacting flow ROMs show a strong sensitivity to \st{the} resolution and are
often unstable. To identify the main underlying causes, a representative
problem that contains the essential physics encountered in typical combustion
dynamics problems is chosen. Comparisons with non-reacting solutions are used
to assess the impact of reactions. Investigations are focused on three
potential areas of significance: 1) preservation of conservation laws; 2) loss
of dissipation; and 3) existence of unphysical local phenomena. Results
indicate that conservation is relatively well-controlled and the global
dissipation in the ROMs is actually larger than that in the underlying CFD
solutions. Spurious local phenomena are, however, highly deleterious.
Specifically, the steep temperature gradients that characterize combustion can
lead to oscillations in local temperatures even in the absence of reactions.
Representative calculations with physics-based temperature constraints verify
that eliminating such excursions results in considerable improvement in both
stability and future-state prediction capability.

radiation and wind feedback on the properties of slowly rotating accretion flow

outflows can be produced by the radiation pressure due to Thomson scattering.
The mass flux of outflow is comparable to that of inflow. Although strong
outflow is present, the luminosity of AGN can be easily super-Eddington. When
wind feedback is also taken into account, the mass flux of outflow does not
change much. Consequently, the luminosity of the central AGN can still be
super-Eddington. However, observations show that the luminosity of most AGNs is
sub-Eddington. Some other mechanisms are needed to reduce the AGNs luminosity.
Although the mass outflow rate does not change much by wind feedback, other
properties of outflow (density, temperature, velocity and kinetic power) can be
significantly changed by wind feedback. In the presence of wind feedback, the
density of outflow becomes significantly lower, temperature of outflow becomes
significantly higher, velocity of outflow is increased by one order of
magnitude, the kinetic power of outflow is increased by a factor of $40-100$.

  Step Sizes","25 pages, 4 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a distributed multi-agent optimization problem over a
time-invariant undirected graph, where each agent possesses a local objective
function and all agents collaboratively minimize the average of all objective
functions through local computations and communications among neighbors.
Recently, a class of distributed gradient methods has been proposed that
achieves both exact and geometric convergence when a constant step size is
used. The geometric convergence of these methods is ensured for conservatively
selected step sizes, but how to choose an appropriate step size while running
the algorithms has not been fully addressed. The Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method
is a simple and effective technique for step sizes and requires few storage and
inexpensive computations. It has been widely applied in various areas. In this
paper, we introduce the BB method to distributed optimization. Based on an
adapt-then-combine variation of the dynamic average consensus approach and
using multi-consensus inner loops, we propose a distributed gradient method
with BB step sizes (DGM-BB-C). Our method computes the step size for each agent
automatically which only depends on its local information and is independent of
that for other agents, and the larger step sizes are always permissible. Our
method can seek the exact optimum when the number of consensus steps stays
constant. We prove that DGM-BB-C has geometric convergence to the optimal
solution. Simulation results on a distributed sensing problem show that our
method is superior to some advanced methods in terms of iterations, gradient
evaluations, communications and the related cost framework. These results
validate our theoretical discoveries.

building blocks in machine learning systems. These algorithms are often adapted
to the event-based domain to perform online learning in neuromorphic hardware.
However, not designed for the purpose, such algorithms typically require
significant simplification during implementation to meet hardware constraints,
creating trade offs with performance. Furthermore, conventional feature
extraction algorithms are not designed to generate useful intermediary signals
which are valuable only in the context of neuromorphic hardware limitations. In
this work a novel event-based feature extraction method is proposed that
focuses on these issues. The algorithm operates via simple adaptive selection
thresholds which allow a simpler implementation of network homeostasis than
previous works by trading off a small amount of information loss in the form of
missed events that fall outside the selection thresholds. The behavior of the
selection thresholds and the output of the network as a whole are shown to
provide uniquely useful signals indicating network weight convergence without
the need to access network weights. A novel heuristic method for network size
selection is proposed which makes use of noise events and their feature
representations. The use of selection thresholds is shown to produce network
activation patterns that predict classification accuracy allowing rapid
evaluation and optimization of system parameters without the need to run
back-end classifiers. The feature extraction method is tested on both the
N-MNIST benchmarking dataset and a dataset of airplanes passing through the
field of view. Multiple configurations with different classifiers are tested
with the results quantifying the resultant performance gains at each processing
stage.

order in materials best known for detecting charge density wave order in the
copper-oxide superconductors. One of the biggest limitations on the RSXS
technique is the presence of a severe fluorescence background which, like the
RSXS cross section itself, is enhanced under resonant conditions. This
background prevents the study of weak signals such as diffuse scattering from
glassy or fluctuating order that is spread widely over momentum space. Recent
advances in superconducting transition edge sensor (TES) detectors have led to
major improvements in energy resolution and detection efficiency in the soft
x-ray range. Here, we perform a RSXS study of stripe-ordered
La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ at the Cu $L_{3/2}$ edge (932.2 eV) using a TES
detector with 1.5 eV resolution, to evaluate its utility for mitigating the
fluorescence background problem. We find that, for suitable degree of detuning
from the resonance, the TES rejects the fluorescence background, leading to a 5
to 10 times improvement in the statistical quality of the data compared to an
equivalent, energy-integrated measurement. We conclude that a TES presents a
promising approach to reducing background in RSXS studies and may lead to new
discoveries in materials exhibiting valence band order that is fluctuating or

motile. Finally, we study the survival probability of a single mutant cell at

present-day amplitude of matter density fluctuations, and has been measured up
to $\ell\approx 10^3$ from the {\it Planck} data. The largest systematic
uncertainty in the interpretation of this data is the so-called ""mass bias""
parameter $B$, which relates the true halo mass to the mass proxy used by the
{\it Planck} team as $M_{\rm 500c}^{Planck}=M_{\rm 500c}^{\rm true}/B$. Since
the power spectrum of the cosmic weak lensing shear is also sensitive to the
amplitude of matter density fluctuations via $S_8\equiv \sigma_8
\Omega_m^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha\sim 0.5$, we can break the degeneracy between
the mass bias and the cosmological parameters by combining the tSZ and cosmic
shear power spectra. In this paper, we perform a joint likelihood analysis of
the tSZ power spectrum from {\it Planck} and the cosmic shear power spectrum
from Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our analysis does not use the primordial cosmic
microwave background (CMB) information. We obtain a new constraint on the mass
bias as $B = 1.37 ^{+0.15}_{-0.23}$ or $(1-b) = B^{-1}=0.73^{+0.08}_{-0.13}$
(68\%~C.L.), for $\sigma_8 < 0.9$. This value of $B$ is lower than that needed
to reconcile the tSZ data with the primordial CMB and CMB lensing data, i.e.,
$B = 1.64 \pm 0.19$, but is consistent with the mass bias expected from
hydrodynamical simulations, $B = 1.28 \pm 0.20$. Our results thus indicate that
the mass bias is consistent with the non-thermal pressure support from mass
accretion of galaxy clusters via the cosmic structure formation, and that the
cosmologies inferred from the tSZ and the cosmic shear are consistent with each
other.

over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. While flows with fluctuations
in thermodynamic variables are much more common, much less is known about these
flows than their incompressible counterparts in which thermodynamics is
decoupled from hydrodynamics. A critical element in the study of the latter has
been the concept of universal scaling laws which provides fundamental as well
as practical information about the spatio-temporal behavior of these complex
systems. Part of this success is due to the dependence on a single
non-dimensional parameter, that is the Reynolds number. Universality in
compressible flows, on the other hand, have proven to be more elusive as no
unifying set of parameters were found to yield universal scaling laws. This
severely limits our understanding of these flows and the successful development
of theoretically sound models. Using results in specific asymptotic limits of
the governing equations we show that universal scaling is indeed observed when
the set of governing parameters is expanded to include internally generated
dilatational scales which are the result of the driving mechanisms that produce
the turbulence. The analysis demonstrate why previous scaling laws fail in the
general case, and opens up new venues to identify physical processes of
interest and create turbulence models needed for simulations of turbulent flows
at realistic conditions. We support our results with a new massive database of
highly-resolved direct numerical simulations along with all data available in
the literature. In search of universal features, we suggest classes which
bundle the evolution of flows in the new parameter space. An ultimate
asymptotic regime predicted independently by renormalization group theories and

typically does not have a fast algorithm. In this work, we develop new
approaches to accelerate the GFT computation. In particular, we show that Haar
units (Givens rotations with angle $\pi/4$) can be used to reduce GFT
computation cost when the graph is bipartite or satisfies certain symmetry
properties based on node pairing. We also propose a graph decomposition method
based on graph topological symmetry, which allows us to identify and exploit
butterfly structures in stages. This method is particularly useful for graphs
that are nearly regular or have some specific structures, e.g., line graphs,
cycle graphs, grid graphs, and human skeletal graphs. Though butterfly stages
based on graph topological symmetry cannot be used for general graphs, they are
useful in applications, including video compression and human action analysis,
where symmetric graphs, such as symmetric line graphs and human skeletal

Bekris","Towards Learning Efficient Maneuver Sets for Kinodynamic Motion Planning",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Planning for systems with dynamics is challenging as often there is no local
planner available and the only primitive to explore the state space is forward
propagation of controls. In this context, tree sampling-based planners have
been developed, some of which achieve asymptotic optimality by propagating
random controls during each iteration. While desirable for the analysis, random
controls result in slow convergence to high quality trajectories in practice.
  This short position statement first argues that if a kinodynamic planner has
access to local maneuvers that appropriately balance an
exploitation-exploration trade-off, the planner's per iteration performance is
significantly improved. Generating such maneuvers during planning can be
achieved by curating a large sample of random controls. This is, however,
computationally very expensive. If such maneuvers can be generated fast, the
planner's performance will also improve as a function of computation time.
  Towards objective, this short position statement argues for the integration
of modern machine learning frameworks with state-of-the-art, informed and
asymptotically optimal kinodynamic planners. The proposed approach involves
using using neural networks to infer local maneuvers for a robotic system with
dynamics, which properly balance the above exploitation-exploration trade-off.
In particular, a neural network architecture is proposed, which is trained to
reflect the choices of an online curation process, given local obstacle and
heuristic information. The planner uses these maneuvers to efficiently explore
the underlying state space, while still maintaining desirable properties.
Preliminary indications in simulated environments and systems are promising but
also point to certain challenges that motivate further research in this
direction.

bipolar bubbles of hot gas surrounded by a weak forward shock. We consider the
possibility that these bubbles were driven by choked relativistic jets which
failed to penetrate the ambient intracluster medium (ICM). Using new results on
choked jets linking the geometry of the forward shock to the jet properties, we
infer robust limits on the radius $R_{ch}$ at which the jet was quenched in 5
well-studied FRI sources, finding typically $R_{ch}\sim 10$ kpc. We further
show that, in order to reach this radius in less than the current age of the
system, the jet must have been tightly collimated, with the jet head subtending
an angle of $\theta_h < 2^\circ$. The ambient pressure is not high enough to
explain this collimation, suggesting that the jet was collimated by interaction
with its own cocoon. Although the choking radius is well-constrained, we find a
degeneracy between the initial jet opening angle before collimation,
$\theta_0$, and the duration of jet activity, $t_b$, with
$(t_b/1\rm{Myr})(\theta_0/5^\circ)^{-2} \sim 0.1$. We speculate that the
working time and/or opening angle of the jet may be important factors
contributing to the FR type I/type II morphology in galaxy clusters, with
short-lived or wide jets being choked to form bipolar bubbles filled with
diffuse radio emission, and longer-lived or narrow jets successfully escaping
the cluster core to produce cocoons with radio hotspots.

we present high-performance monolayer MoS2 FETs with Ohmic contact at a modest

from disturbances due to the bimodal solar wind, CME deflection, irregular CME
expansion, and the ubiquitous fluctuations in the solar corona. In order to
understand the role of a wavy shock in particle acceleration, we define three
initial smooth shock morphologies each one associated with a fast CME. Using
polar Gaussian profiles we model these shocks in the low corona. We establish
the corrugated appearance on smooth shock by using combinations of wave-like
functions that represent the disturbances from medium and CME piston. For both
shock types, smooth and corrugated, we calculate the shock normal angles
between the shock normal and the radial upstream coronal magnetic field in
order to classify the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular regions. We
consider that corrugated shocks are predisposed to different process of
particle acceleration due to irregular distributions of shock normal angles
around of the shock. We suggest that disturbances due to CME irregular
expansion may be a decisive factor in origin of particle acceleration. Finally,
we regard that accepting these features on shocks may be the start point for
investigating some questions in the sheath and shock, like downstream-jets,
instabilities, shock thermalization, shock stability, and injection particle
process.

spatiotemporal mathematical model to characterize massive IoT networks with

is utilized to account for the macroscopic network wide mutual interference

employed to track the microscopic evolution of packets within each priority

the prioritized queueing model at each device to a single-queue system with
server vacation. To this end, the IoT network with PMT is modeled as spatially
interacting vacation queues. Interactions between queues, in terms of the
packet departure probabilities, occur due to mutual interference. Service
vacations occur to lower priority packets to address higher priority packets.
Based on the proposed model, dedicated and shared channel access strategies for
different priority classes are presented and compared. The results show that
shared access provides better performance when considering the transmission

revealed species of ever greater complexity. This search relies on the progress
made in the laboratory to characterize their rotational spectra. Our
understanding of the processes that lead to molecular complexity in the ISM
builds on numerical simulations that use chemical networks fed by laboratory
and theoretical studies. The advent of ALMA and NOEMA has opened a new door to
explore molecular complexity in the ISM. Their high angular resolution reduces
the spectral confusion of star-forming cores and their increased sensitivity
allows the detection of low-abundance molecules that could not be probed
before. The complexity of the recently-detected molecules manifests itself not
only in terms of number of atoms but also in their molecular structure. We
discuss these developments and report on ReMoCA, a new spectral line survey
performed with ALMA toward the high-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(N).

  Implications of Artificial Intelligence",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ethical implications and social impacts of artificial intelligence have
become topics of compelling interest to industry, researchers in academia, and
the public. However, current analyses of AI in a global context are biased
toward perspectives held in the U.S., and limited by a lack of research,
especially outside the U.S. and Western Europe.
  This article summarizes the key findings of a literature review of recent
social science scholarship on the social impacts of AI and related technologies
in five global regions. Our team of social science researchers reviewed more
than 800 academic journal articles and monographs in over a dozen languages.
  Our review of the literature suggests that AI is likely to have markedly
different social impacts depending on geographical setting. Likewise,
perceptions and understandings of AI are likely to be profoundly shaped by
local cultural and social context.
  Recent research in U.S. settings demonstrates that AI-driven technologies
have a pattern of entrenching social divides and exacerbating social
inequality, particularly among historically-marginalized groups. Our literature
review indicates that this pattern exists on a global scale, and suggests that
low- and middle-income countries may be more vulnerable to the negative social
impacts of AI and less likely to benefit from the attendant gains.
  We call for rigorous ethnographic research to better understand the social
impacts of AI around the world. Global, on-the-ground research is particularly
critical to identify AI systems that may amplify social inequality in order to
mitigate potential harms. Deeper understanding of the social impacts of AI in
diverse social settings is a necessary precursor to the development,
implementation, and monitoring of responsible and beneficial AI technologies,
and forms the basis for meaningful regulation of these technologies.

has been predicted that high quality Bi2O2Se-related heterostructures may
possess exotic physical phenomena, such as piezoelectricity and topological

growth of Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3 substrates via pulsed laser deposition (PLD)
method. Films obtained under optimal conditions show an epitaxial growth with
the c axis perpendicular to the film surface and the a and b axes parallel to
the substrate. The growth mode transition to three dimensional (3D) island from
quasi-2D layer of the heteroepitaxial Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates
is observed as prolonging deposition time of films. The maximum value of
electron mobility reaches 160 cm2/V-1s-1 at room temperature in a 70nm-thick
film. The thickness dependent mobility provides evidence that
interface-scattering is likely to be the limiting factor for the relatively low
electron mobility at low temperature, implying that the interface engineering
as an effective method to tune the low temperature electron mobility. Our work
suggests the epitaxial Bi2O2Se films grown by PLD are promising for both
fundamental study and practical applications.

stylized facts that might help identify the underlying patch-level dynamics.
For instance, the emergence of scaling laws in the aggregated probability
distribution of patch lifetimes can be associated to critical phenomena, in
which the correlation length among system units tends to diverge. Nevertheless,
an aggregated approach is biased by patch-level variability, a fact that can
blur the interpretation of the data. Here, I propose a weakly-coupled
metapopulation model to show how patch variability can solely trigger
qualitatively different lifetime probability distribution at the aggregated
level. In a generalized approach, I obtain a two-way connection between the
variability of a certain patch property (e.g. carrying capacity, environment
condition or connectivity) and the aggregated lifetime probability
distribution. Furthermore, for a particular case, assuming that scaling laws
are observed at the aggregated-level, I speculate the heterogeneity that could
be behind it, relating the qualitative features the variability (mean, variance
and concentration) to the scaling exponents. In this perspective, the
application points to the possibility of equivalence between heterogeneous
weakly-coupled metapopulations and homogeneous ones that exhibit critical

accurate segmentation. Our inferred prior can provide reliable indication of
the instrument location and shape, which is propagated from the previous frame
to the current frame according to inter-frame motion flow. This prior is
injected to the middle of an encoder-decoder segmentation network as an
initialization of a pyramid of attention modules, to explicitly guide
segmentation output from coarse to fine. In this way, the temporal dynamics and
the attention network can effectively complement and benefit each other. As
additional usage, our temporal prior enables semi-supervised learning with
periodically unlabeled video frames, simply by reverse execution. We
extensively validate our method on the public 2017 MICCAI EndoVis Robotic
Instrument Segmentation Challenge dataset with three different tasks. Our
method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art results across all three tasks
by a large margin. Our semi-supervised variant also demonstrates a promising

the infeasible point, is valid for the feasible region. We show that the
reverse polar of the visible points of the feasible region from the infeasible
point coincides with the reverse polar of the feasible region. In the special
where the feasible region is described by a single non-convex constraint
intersected with a convex set we provide a characterization of the visible
points. Furthermore, when the non-convex constraint is quadratic the
characterization is particularly simple. We also provide an extended
formulation for a relaxation of the visible points when the non-convex
constraint is a general polynomial. Finally, we give some conditions under
which for a given set there is an inclusion-wise smallest set, in some
predefined family of sets, whose reverse polars coincide.

subject to an infinite sequence of attacks so that each attack must be defended
by a guard moving from a neighboring vertex. The m-eternal domination number is
the minimum number of guards such that the graph can be defended indefinitely.
In this paper we study the m-eternal domination number of cactus graphs, that
is, connected graphs where each edge lies in at most two cycles, and we
consider three variants of the m-eternal domination number: first variant
allows multiple guards to occupy a single vertex, second variant does not allow
it, and in the third variant additional ""eviction"" attacks must be defended. We
provide a new upper bound for the m-eternal domination number of cactus graphs,
and for a subclass of cactus graphs called Christmas cactus graphs, where each

Moreover, we present a linear-time algorithm for computing them.

spatial-temporal information of the crowd that would help improve the
robustness of crowd counting. But translation, rotation and scaling of people

Meanwhile, people walking in/out or being occluded in dynamic scenes leads to
the change of head counts. To alleviate these issues in video crowd counting, a
Locality-constrained Spatial Transformer Network (LSTN) is proposed.
Specifically, we first leverage a Convolutional Neural Networks to estimate the
density map for each frame. Then to relate the density maps between
neighbouring frames, a Locality-constrained Spatial Transformer (LST) module is
introduced to estimate the density map of next frame with that of current
frame. To facilitate the performance evaluation, a large-scale video crowd
counting dataset is collected, which contains 15K frames with about 394K
annotated heads captured from 13 different scenes. As far as we know, it is the
largest video crowd counting dataset. Extensive experiments on our dataset and
other crowd counting datasets validate the effectiveness of our LSTN for crowd

(2018) of the earlier paper of Partanen {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 95},

(1) the first one regards the physical interpretation of the radiation pressure
experiment of A. Kundu {\it et al.} [Sci. Rep. {\bf 7}, 42538 (2017)]. My
mathematical analysis of this situation, although simple, was able to
illustrate the main property of the experiment, namely that it showed the
action from the radiation forces on the dielectric boundaries, and from the
Lorentz force in the interior, but it had not any relationship to the
Abraham-Minkowski momentum problem as was originally stated by the
investigators. (2) The second point was my emphasis on the fact that in an
electromagnetic pulse in a medium there cannot be an accompanying mechanical
energy density of the same order of magnitude as the electromagnetic energy
density itself. The electromagnetic wave carries with it a mechanical {\it
momentum}, but not a mechanical {\it energy}. Here I illustrate this point by a
simple numerical analysis. (3) When going to a relativistic formulation of the
electromagnetic theory in matter, care must be taken to secure that fundamental
conditions from field theory are satisfied. In particular, one cannot in
general take the electromagnetic total energy and momentum of a radiation pulse
to constitute a four-vector; such a property holds only if the electromagnetic
energy-momentum tensor is divergence-free. For the Minkowski tensor this
condition is satisfied, whereas for the Abraham tensor it is not.

resources, and module interfaces are designed to natively support streaming
on-chip communications, allowing them to be composed to reduce off-chip

spatial $ \Lambda $-Fleming-Viot process introduced by Barton, Etheridge and
V\'eber, which describes the state of the population at any time by a measure
on $ \R^d \times [0,1] $, where $ \R^d $ is the geographical space and $ [0,1]

dispersal), we prove a functional central limit theorem for the process as the
population density becomes large and under some space-time rescaling. We then
deduce from these two central limit theorems a formula for the asymptotic
probability of identity of two individuals picked at random from two given
spatial locations. In the case of short range dispersal, we recover the
classical Wright-Mal\'ecot formula, which is widely used in demographic
inference for spatially structured populations. In the case of long range
dispersal we obtain a new formula which could open the way for a better
appraisal of long range dispersal in inference methods.

to be post$-$AGB stars. Recent studies show that they might be either indeed
post$-$AGB or post$-$RGB objects depending on their luminosity. For both

electromagnetic calculations demonstrates that this procedure allows
characterizing the meV shifts experienced by the dipolar and quadrupolar

setting, the average time spent by $X_n$ in the interval $(x,x+1]$ is roughly
speaking the reciprocal of the drift and tends to infinity as $x$ grows.
  For the first time we present a general approach relying in a diffusion
approximation to prove renewal theorems for Markov chains. We apply a
martingale type technique and show that the asymptotic behaviour of the renewal
measure heavily depends on the rate at which the drift vanishes. The two main
cases are distinguished, either the drift of the chain decreases as $1/x$ or
much slower than that, say as $1/x^\alpha$ for some $\alpha\in(0,1)$.
  The intuition behind how the renewal measure behaves in these two cases is
totally different. While in the first case $X_n^2/n$ converges weakly to a
$\Gamma$-distribution and there is no law of large numbers available, in the
second case a strong law of large numbers holds true for $X_n^{1+\alpha}/n$ and
further normal approximation is available.

the calculation of numerically exact quantum Boltzmann properties and

integration schemes for equations of motion based on imaginary-time path
integrals is the use of harmonic normal modes for the exact evolution of the
free ring-polymer positions and momenta. In this work, we demonstrate that this
standard practice creates numerical artifacts. In the context of conservative
(i.e., microcanonical) equations of motion, it leads to numerical instability.
In the context of thermostatted (i.e., canonical) equations of motion, it leads
to non-ergodicity of the sampling. These pathologies are generally proven to
arise at integration timesteps that depend only on the system temperature and
the number of ring-polymer beads, and they are numerically demonstrated for the
cases of conventional ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and thermostatted
RPMD (TRPMD). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that these numerical artifacts
are removed via replacement of the exact free ring-polymer evolution with a
second-order approximation based on the Cayley transform. The Cayley
modification introduced here can immediately be employed with almost every
existing integration scheme for path-integral-based molecular dynamics -
including path-integral MD (PIMD), RPMD, TRPMD, and centroid MD - providing
strong symplectic stability and ergodicity to the numerical integration, at no
penalty in terms of computational cost, algorithmic complexity, or accuracy of
the overall MD timestep. Furthermore, it is shown that the improved numerical
stability of the Cayley modification allows for the use of larger MD timesteps.
We suspect that the Cayley modification will therefore find useful application
in many future path-integral-based MD simulations.

In this paper we present a further look at these missed injections. It is shown
that all of the missed injections can be explained by combinations of the noise
statistics, mis-labelling, overly harsh data analysis cuts, incorrect S/N
calculations and radio frequency interference. There is no need to be alarmed.

about language. A prominent open question is the question of whether or not it
is necessary to model hierarchical structure. We present a linguistic
investigation of a neural parser adding insights to this question. We look at
transitivity and agreement information of auxiliary verb constructions (AVCs)
in comparison to finite main verbs (FMVs). This comparison is motivated by
theoretical work in dependency grammar and in particular the work of Tesni\`ere
(1959) where AVCs and FMVs are both instances of a nucleus, the basic unit of
syntax. An AVC is a dissociated nucleus, it consists of at least two words, and
an FMV is its non-dissociated counterpart, consisting of exactly one word. We
suggest that the representation of AVCs and FMVs should capture similar
information. We use diagnostic classifiers to probe agreement and transitivity
information in vectors learned by a transition-based neural parser in four
typologically different languages. We find that the parser learns different
information about AVCs and FMVs if only sequential models (BiLSTMs) are used in
the architecture but similar information when a recursive layer is used. We
find explanations for why this is the case by looking closely at how
information is learned in the network and looking at what happens with
different dependency representations of AVCs. We conclude that there may be
benefits to using a recursive layer in dependency parsing and that we have not
yet found the best way to integrate it in our parsers.

the Solar Dynamics Observatory were utilized to explore the changes in the

that at the very early stage of the magnetic flux emergence, an abrupt
steepening of the magnetic power spectrum takes place leading to rapid increase
of the absolute value of the negative spectra power index $\alpha$ in $E(k)$
$\sim$ $k^{\alpha}$. As the emergence proceeds, the energy increases at all
scales simultaneously implying that elements of all sizes do appear in the
photosphere. Meanwhile, the energy gain at scales larger than $\approx$10 Mm
prevails as compared to that at smaller scales. Both direct (i.e.,
fragmentation of large structures into smaller ones) and inverse (i.e., merging
of small magnetic features into larger elements) cascades are readily observed
during the emergence. However, in the case of inverse cascade, the total energy
gained at large scales exceeds the energy loss at smaller scales assuming
simultaneous appearance of large-scale magnetic entities from beneath the
photosphere. We conclude that most of the time the energy may grow at all
scales. We also cannot support the point of view regarding the dominant role of
the inverse cascade in the formation of an AR. Although the coalescence of
small magnetic elements into larger pores and sunspots is observed, our
analysis shows that the prevailed energy contribution to an AR comes from
emergence of large-scale structures.

tunnels first to the neighbouring empty site and depending on the quench

with the EUV wave kinematics exceeding those of the Moreton-Ramsey wave. The
density compression ratio of each global wave was estimated using both
differential emission measure and intensity variation techniques, with both
indicating that the observed waves were weakly shocked with a fast magnetosonic

generally assumed that there is no charged matter present; that is, the
electric field is divergence-free. The aim of this article is to clarify when
the charged Riemannian Penrose inequality holds in the presence of charged
matter, and when it does not.
  First we revisit Jang's proof of the charged Riemannian Penrose inequality to
show that under suitable conditions on the charged matter, this argument still
carries though. In particular, a charged Riemannian Penrose inequality is
obtained from this argument when charged matter is present provided that the
charge density does not change sign. Moreover, we show that such hypotheses on
the sign of the charge are in fact required by constructing counterexamples to
the charged Riemannian Penrose inequality when these conditions are violated.
We conclude by comparing this counterexample to another version of the
Riemannian Penrose inequality with charged matter existing in the literature.

matter produced through freeze-in is an attractive proposal, naturally
explaining null results by virtue of its feeble couplings with the Standard
Model (SM) particles. We consider a minimal extension of the SM by two gauge
singlet fields namely, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd fermion $\chi$ and a pseudo scalar
$\tilde{\phi}$, where the former has interactions with the SM particles only at
dimension five level and beyond. This introduces natural suppression in the
interactions of $\chi$ by a heavy new physics scale $\Lambda$ and forces $\chi$
to be a non-thermal dark matter candidate. We have studied production of $\chi$
in detail taking into account both ultra-violate (UV), infra-red (IR) as well
as mixed UV-IR freeze-in and found that for $10^{10}{\rm GeV}\leq\Lambda\leq
10^{15}{\rm GeV}$, $\chi$ is dominantly produced via UV and mixed UV-IR
freeze-in when reheat temperature $T_{RH}\gtrsim 10^4$ GeV and below which the
production is dominated by IR and mixed freeze-in. Furthermore, we have
considered the cascade annihilation $\chi\bar{\chi} \rightarrow
\tilde{\phi}\tilde{\phi}\rightarrow 4\gamma$ to address the longstanding
$\sim3.5$ keV X-ray line observed from various galaxies and galaxy clusters. We
have found that the long-lived intermediate state $\tilde{\phi}$ modifies dark

discrete memoryless source sequences whose joint probability mass function
depends on a binary hypothesis. The goal at each detector is to guess the
binary hypothesis in a way that, for increasing observation lengths, the
probability of error under one of the hypotheses decays to zero with largest
possible exponential decay, whereas the probability of error under the other
hypothesis can decay to zero arbitrarily slow. For the setting with zero-rate
communication on both links, we exactly characterize the set of possible
exponents and the gain brought up by cooperation, in function of the number of
bits that are sent over the two links. Notice that, for this setting, tradeoffs
between the exponents achieved at the two detectors arise only in few
particular cases. In all other cases, each detector achieves the same
performance as if it were the only detector in the system. For the setting with
positive communication rates from the sensor to the detectors, we characterize
the set of all possible exponents in a special case of testing against
independence. In this case the cooperation link allows Detector~2 to increase
its Type-II error exponent by an amount that is equal to the exponent attained
at Detector 1. We also provide a general inner bound on the set of achievable
error exponents. For most cases it shows a tradeoff between the two exponents.

  Our first result is a sensitive distance oracle with

$\tilde{O}(Wn^{2-\mu}f^{2}+Wnf^{\omega})$ update time, and
$\tilde{O}(Wn^{2-\mu}f+Wnf^{2})$ query time where the parameter $\mu\in[0,1]$

algorithm simultaneously improves their preprocessing time, update time, and
query time. In particular, when $f=\omega(1)$, their update and query time is
$\Omega(n^{2-o(1)})$, while our update and query time are truly subquadratic in
$n$, i.e., ours is faster by a polynomial factor of $n$. To highlight the

oscillators and, more recently, in quantum systems. However, it remains unclear
what features distinguish synchronous behaviour in these two scenarios. Recent
works have shown that investigating the dynamics of synchronisation in open
quantum systems can give insight into this issue. Here we study transient
synchronisation in a bio-inspired vibronic dimer, where the dynamics of
electronic excitation is mediated by coherent interactions with intramolecular
vibrational modes. We show that the synchronisation dynamics of the
displacement of these local modes exhibit a rich behaviour which arises
directly from the distinct time-evolutions of different vibronic quantum
coherences. Furthermore, our study shows that coherent energy transport in this
bio-inspired system is concomitant with the emergence of positive
synchronisation between mode displacements. Our work provides further
understanding of the relations between quantum coherence and synchronisation in
open quantum systems and suggests an interesting role for coherence in
biomolecules, that is promoting the synchronisation of vibrational motions
driven out of thermal equilibrium.

Wasserstein distances. We simulate a reaction network at different parameter
settings and train a Gaussian process to learn the Wasserstein distance between
observations and the simulator output for all parameters. We then use Bayesian
optimization to find parameters minimizing this distance based on the trained
Gaussian process. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on the
three-stage model of gene expression and a genetic feedback loop for which
moment-based methods are known to perform poorly. Our method is applicable to
any simulator model of stochastic reaction networks, including Brownian
Dynamics.

ducts with several aspect ratios. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized
through a second-order finite difference scheme, with non-uniform grids in two
directions. The duct cross-sectional area is maintained constant as well as the
flow rate, which allows to investigate which is the appropriate length scale in
the Reynolds number for a good scaling in the laminar and in the fully
turbulent regimes. We find that the Reynolds number based on the half length of
the short side leads to a critical Reynolds number which is independent on the
aspect ratio (AR), for ducts with AR>1. The mean and rms wall-normal velocity
profiles are found to scale with the local value of the friction velocity. At
high friction Reynolds numbers, the Reynolds number dependence is similar to
that in turbulent plane channels, hence flows in rectangular ducts allow to
investigate the Reynolds number dependency through a reduced number of
simulations. At low Re the profiles of the statistics differ from those in the
two-dimensional channel due to the interaction of flow structures of different
size. The projection of the velocity vector and of the Reynolds stress tensor
along the eigenvectors of the strain-rate tensor yields reduced Reynolds stress
anisotropy, and simple turbulent kinetic energy budgets.

The ratio of the parallel to the perpendicular diffusion depends on the
buckling direction and stacking type, and it increases with the degree of
buckling. The strongest anisotropy is observed in the case of fixed zig-zag
edges. A comparison with the interlayer diffusion of Na suggests that the
strong asymmetry in the vibrational states of buckled graphene and also the
smaller mass of Li are likely to contribute to the observed diffusion
enhancement. This work opens a new pathway to develop highly-efficient anodes

malady. Information at high spatial and spectral resolution in the FIR, taken
from atomic fine-structure lines, highly excited CO, and especially from water
lines would, however, open the door for transformative science. This calls for
interferometric concepts. We present first results of our feasibility study
IRASSI (Infrared Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometry) for a FIR space
interferometer. Extending on the principal concept of the ESPRIT study, it
features heterodyne interferometry within a swarm of 5 satellite elements. The
satellites can drift in and out within a range of several hundred meters,
thereby achieving spatial resolutions of <0.1"" over the whole wavelength range
of 1-6 THz. Precise knowledge on the baselines will be ensured by metrology
methods employing laser-based optical frequency combs, for which preliminary
ground-based tests have been designed by us. We first show how the science
requirements translate into operational and design parameters. We have put much
emphasis on the navigational aspects of such a free-flying satellite swarm
operating in relatively close vicinity. We hence present work on the formation
geometry, the relative dynamics of the swarm, and aspects of our investigation
towards attitude estimation. Furthermore, we discuss issues regarding the
real-time capability of the autonomous relative positioning system, which is an
important aspect for IRASSI where, due to the large raw data rates expected,
the interferometric correlation has to be done onboard. We also address
questions regarding the spacecraft architecture and how a thermomechanical

snapshotting of applications is crucial in the deployment of pre-initialized
applications or moving running applications to different machines, e.g for
debugging purposes. A key issue is that snapshotting blocks all other
operations. In modern latency-sensitive applications, stopping the application
to persist its state needs to be avoided, because users may not tolerate the
increased request latency. In order to minimize the impact of snapshotting on
request latency, our approach persists the application's state asynchronously
by capturing partial heaps, completing snapshots step by step. Additionally,
our solution is transparent and supports arbitrary object graphs. We prototyped
our snapshotting approach on top of the Truffle/Graal platform and evaluated it
with the Savina benchmarks and the Acme Air microservice application. When
performing a snapshot every thousand Acme Air requests, the number of slow
requests ( 0.007% of all requests) with latency above 100ms increases by 5.43%.
Our Savina microbenchmark results detail how different utilization patterns
impact snapshotting cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
system that enables asynchronous snapshotting of actor applications, i.e.
without stop-the-world synchronization, and thereby minimizes the impact on
latency. We thus believe it enables new deployment and debugging options for
actor systems.

and temporally single-mode parametric down-conversion source in non-linear
waveguides. Due to the distillation, we witness an improvement of
$0.17~\mathrm{dB}$ from an initial squeezing value of $-1.648 \pm
0.002~\mathrm{dB}$, while achieving a purity of $0.58$, and confirm the
non-Gaussianity of the distilled state via the higher-order cumulants. With

  abridged",,,,"astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, I describe a number of recent important developments in
neutrino cosmology on three fronts. Firstly, focusing on Large-Scale Structure
(LSS) data, I will show that current cosmological probes contain a wealth of
information on the sum of the neutrino masses. I report on the analysis leading
to the currently best upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of
$0.12\,{\rm eV}$. I show how cosmological data exhibits a weak preference for
the normal neutrino mass ordering because of parameter space volume effects,
and propose a simple method to quantify this preference. Secondly, I will
discuss how galaxy bias represents a severe limitation towards fully
capitalizing on the neutrino information hidden in LSS data. I propose a method
for calibrating the scale-dependent galaxy bias using CMB lensing-galaxy
cross-correlations. Moreover, in the presence of massive neutrinos, the usual
definition of bias becomes inadequate, as it leads to a scale-dependence on
large scales which has never been accounted for. I show that failure to define
the bias appropriately will be a problem for future LSS surveys, and propose a
simple recipe to account for the effect of massive neutrinos on galaxy bias.
Finally, I discuss implications of correlations between neutrino parameters and
other cosmological parameters. In non-phantom dynamical dark energy models, the
upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses becomes tighter than the
$\Lambda$CDM limit. Therefore, such models exhibit an even stronger preference
for the normal ordering, and their viability could be jeopardized should
near-future laboratory experiments determine that the mass ordering is
inverted. I then discuss correlations between neutrino and inflationary
parameters. I find that our determination of inflationary parameters is stable
against assumptions about the neutrino sector. (abridged)

Milky Way stellar disk due to diffuse processes (i.e. so called blurring) and
due to influences from spiral arms and the bar (i.e. so called churning). To
this end we assume that it is possible to infer the formation radius of a star
if we know their elemental abundances and age as well as the metallicity
profile of the interstellar medium at the time of the formation of the star.
Using this information, coupled with orbital information derived from Gaia DR2
data and radial velocities from large spectroscopic surveys, we show that it is
possible to isolate stellar samples such that we can start to quantify how
important the role of churning is. We use data from APOGEE DR14, parallaxes
from Gaia and stellar ages based on C and N elemental abundances in the stars.
In our sample, we find that about half of the stars have experienced some sort
of radial migration (based solely on their orbital properties), 10 % have
likely have suffered only from churning, whilst a modest 5-7 % of stars have
never experienced either churning or blurring making them ideal tracers of the
original properties of the cool stellar disk. Our investigation shows that it
is possible to put up a framework where we can begin to quantify churning and
blurring an important. Important aspects for future work would include to
investigate how selection effects should be accounted for.

individual strands, and we study wave heating effects by considering a combined
transverse and torsional driver at the loop footpoint. We deposit the same
energy into the multi-stranded loop and an equivalent monolithic loop, and then
observe a faster increase in the internal energy and temperature in the
multi-stranded model. Therefore, the multi-stranded model is more efficient in
starting the heating process. Moreover, higher temperature is observed near the
footpoint in the multi-stranded loop and near the apex in the monolithic loop.
The apparent heating location in the multi-stranded loop agrees with the
previous predictions and observations. Given the differences in the results
from our multi-stranded loop and monolithic loop simulations, and given that
coronal loops are suggested to be multi-stranded on both theoretical and
observational grounds, our results suggest that the multi-strandedness of

optical waveguide array chip, a technology expected to have many applications
in telecommunications and optical quantum information processing. This photonic
circuit can be electrically reconfigured, but only the output optical signal
can be monitored. As a result, the conventional control methods cannot be
naively applied. Characterizing such a chip is challenging for three reasons.
First, there are uncertainties associated with the Hamiltonian describing the
chip. Second, we expect distortions of the control voltages caused by the
chip's electrical response, which cannot be directly observed. Finally, there
are imperfections in the measurements caused by losses from coupling the chip
externally to optical fibers. We developed a deep neural network approach to
solve these problems. The architecture is designed specifically to overcome the
aforementioned challenges using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based network as
the central component. The Hamiltonian is estimated as a blackbox, while the
rules of quantum mechanics such as state evolution is embedded in the structure
as a whitebox. The resulting overall graybox model of the chip shows good
performance both quantitatively in terms of the mean square error and
qualitatively in terms of the predicted waveforms. We use this neural network
to solve a classical and a quantum control problem. In the classical
application we find a control sequence to approximately realize a
time-dependent output power distribution. For the quantum application we obtain
the control voltages to realize a target set of quantum gates. The proposed
method is generic and can be applied to other systems that can only be probed
indirectly.

achieve some predetermined objective in an online randomized environment. They
have algorithmic implications in various areas of computer science, as well as
connections to biological processes involving decision making. In this paper,
we consider a recently proposed semi-random graph process, described as
follows: we start with an empty graph on $n$ vertices, and in each round, the
decision-maker, called Builder, receives a uniformly random vertex $v$, and
must immediately (in an online manner) choose another vertex $u$, adding the
edge $\{u,v\}$ to the graph. Builder's end goal is to make the constructed
graph satisfy some predetermined monotone graph property.
  We consider the property of containing a spanning graph $H$ as a subgraph. It
was asked by N. Alon whether for any bounded-degree $H$, Builder can construct
a copy of $H$ w.h.p. in $O(n)$ rounds. We answer this question positively in a
strong sense, showing that any graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ can be
constructed w.h.p. in $(3\Delta/2 + o(\Delta)) n$ rounds. This is tight (even
for the offline case) up to a multiplicative factor of $3 + o_{\Delta}(1)$.
Furthermore, for the special case where $H$ is a spanning forest of maximum
degree $\Delta$, we show that $H$ can be constructed w.h.p. in $O(n \log
\Delta)$ rounds. This is tight up to a multiplicative constant, even for the
offline setting. Finally, we show a separation between adaptive and
non-adaptive strategies, proving a lower bound of $\Omega(n\sqrt{\log n})$ on
the number of rounds necessary to eliminate all isolated vertices w.h.p. using
a non-adaptive strategy. This bound is tight, and in fact there are
non-adaptive strategies for constructing a Hamilton cycle or a $K_r$-factor,
which are successful w.h.p. within $O(n\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds.

strategy for zero temperature to construct forces for the geometric phase gate

answering range queries on trajectory data. In order to guarantee privacy,
differential privacy mechanisms add noise to either data or query, thus
introducing errors to queries made and potentially decreasing the utility of
information. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, our method achieves
significantly lower error as it is the first data- and query-aware approach for
such queries. The key challenge for answering range queries on trajectory data
privately is to ensure an accurate count. Simply representing a trajectory as a
set instead of \emph{sequence} of points will generally lead to highly
inaccurate query answers as it ignores the sequential dependency of location
points in trajectories, i.e., will violate the consistency of trajectory data.
Furthermore, trajectories are generally unevenly distributed across a city and
adding noise uniformly will generally lead to a poor utility. To achieve
differential privacy, our algorithm adaptively adds noise to the input data
according to the given query set. It first privately partitions the data space
into uniform regions and computes the traffic density of each region. The
regions and their densities, in addition to the given query set, are then used
to estimate the distribution of trajectories over the queried space, which
ensures high accuracy for the given query set. We show the accuracy and

completing complex tasks such as mastering Go and other games with higher
scores than human players. Many of these models collect considerable data on
the tasks and improve accuracy by extracting visual and time-series features
using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks,
respectively. However, these networks have very high computational costs
because they need to be trained by repeatedly using a large volume of past
playing data. In this study, we propose a novel practical approach called
reinforcement learning with convolutional reservoir computing (RCRC) model. The
RCRC model has several desirable features: 1. it can extract visual and
time-series features very fast because it uses random fixed-weight CNN and the
reservoir computing model; 2. it does not require the training data to be
stored because it extracts features without training and decides action with
evolution strategy. Furthermore, the model achieves state of the art score in
the popular reinforcement learning task. Incredibly, we find the random
weight-fixed simple networks like only one dense layer network can also reach
high score in the RL task.

change with a large structural transition within our profession. Many
astronomers are deeply concerned about climate change and act upon it in their
personal and professional lives, and many organizations within astronomy have
incorporated incremental changes. We need a collective impact model to better
network and grow our efforts so that we can achieve results that are on the
scale appropriate to address climate change at the necessary level indicated by
scientific research; e.g., becoming carbon neutral by 2050. We need to
implement strategies within two primary drivers of our field: (1) Education and
Outreach, and (2) Research Practices and Infrastructure. (1) In the classroom
and through public talks, astronomers reach a large audience. Astronomy is
closely connected to the science of climate change, and it is arguably the most
important topic we include in our curriculum. Due to misinformation and
disinformation, climate change communication is different than for other areas
of science. We therefore need to expand our communication and implement
effective strategies, for which there is now a considerable body of research.
(2) On a per-person basis astronomers have an outsized carbon impact. There are
numerous ways we can reduce our footprint; e.g., in the design and operation of
telescope facilities and in the optimization and reduction of travel.
Fortunately, many of these solutions are win-win scenarios, e.g., increasing
the online presence of conferences will reduce the carbon footprint while
increasing participation, especially for astronomers working with fewer
financial resources. Astronomers have an obligation to act on climate change in
every way possible, and we need to do it now. In this White Paper, we outline a
plan for collective impact using a Networked Improvement Community (NIC)
approach.

development of high performance in storing and processing huge amounts of data

availability of large-scale systems. Exact modelling of such clusters is not
feasible due to the nature of the large scale nodes and the diversity of user

under the heterogeneous pairwise key predistribution scheme. This scheme was
recently introduced as an extension of the random pairwise key predistribution
scheme of Chan et al. to accommodate networks where the constituent sensors
have different capabilities or requirements for security and connectivity. For
simplicity, we consider a heterogeneous network where each of the $n$ sensors
is classified as type-1 (respectively, type-2) with probability $\mu$
(respectively, $1-\mu)$ where $0<\mu<1$. Each type-1 (respectively, type-2)
node selects 1 (respectively, $K_n$) other nodes uniformly at random to be
paired with; according to the pairwise scheme each pair is then assigned a
unique pairwise key so that they can securely communicate with each other. We
establish critical conditions on $n, \mu$, and $K_n$ such that the resulting
network has minimum node degree of at least $k$ with high probability in the
limit of large network size. Our result constitutes a zero-one law for the
minimum node degree of the recently introduced inhomogeneous random K-out graph
model. This constitutes a crucial step towards establishing a similar zero-one
law for the $k$-connectivity of the graph; i.e., for the property that the
network remains connected despite the failure of any $k-1$ nodes or links. We
present numerical results that indicate the usefulness of our results in
selecting the parameters of the scheme in practical settings with finite number

generalize poorly to images whose appearance significantly differs from the

data is prohibitively expensive, we introduce a self-supervised approach to
object detection and segmentation, able to work with monocular images captured
with a moving camera. At the heart of our approach lies the observation that
segmentation and background reconstruction are linked tasks, and the idea that,
because we observe a structured scene, background regions can be re-synthesized
from their surroundings, whereas regions depicting the object cannot. We
therefore encode this intuition as a self-supervised loss function that we
exploit to train a proposal-based segmentation network. To account for the
discrete nature of object proposals, we develop a Monte Carlo-based training
strategy that allows us to explore the large space of object proposals. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach yields accurate detections and
segmentations in images that visually depart from those of standard benchmarks,
outperforming existing self-supervised methods and approaching weakly
supervised ones that exploit large annotated datasets.

resources to quantifying and ranking the performance of individuals and

actions of top performers as the `best practices' that others should also
adopt. However, several studies have shown that the imitation of best practices
often leads to a drop in performance. So, should those lagging behind in a
ranking imitate top performers or should they instead pursue a strategy of
their own? I tackle this question by numerically simulating a stylised model of
a society whose agents seek to climb a ranking either by imitating the actions
of top performers or by randomly trying out different actions, i.e., via
serendipity. The model gives rise to a rich phenomenology, showing that the
imitation of top performers increases welfare overall, but at the cost of
higher inequality. Indeed, the imitation of top performers turns out to be a
self-defeating strategy that consolidates the early advantage of a few lucky -
and not necessarily talented - winners, leading to a very unequal, homogenised,
and effectively non-meritocratic society. Conversely, serendipity favours
meritocratic outcomes and prevents rankings from freezing.

counterparts in the network over a period of time. Super point detection plays
an important role in network research and application. With the increase of
network scale, distributed super point detection has become a hot research
topic. Compared with single-node super point detection algorithm, the
difficulty of super point detection in multi-node distributed environment is
how to reduce communication overhead. Therefore, this paper proposes a
three-stage communication distributed super point detection algorithm: Rough
Estimator based Asynchronous Distributed super point detection algorithm
(READ). READ uses a lightweight estimator, the Rough Estimator (RE), which is
fast in computation and takes less memory to generate candidate super point. At
the same time, the Linear Estimator (LE) is used to accurately estimate the
cardinality of each candidate super point, so as to detect the super point
correctly. In READ, each node scans IP address pairs asynchronously. When
reaching the time window boundary, READ starts three-stage communication to
detect the super point. In this paper, we proof that the accuracy of READ in
distributed environment is no less than that in the single node environment.
Four groups of 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s real-world high-speed network traffic are
used to test READ. The experimental results show that READ not only has higher
accuracy in distributed environment, but also has less than 5% of communication
burden compared with existing algorithms.

H13CO+ (J=4-3) and HC15N (J=4-3) in the HD97048 protoplanetary disk for the
first time. We compare these new detections to the ringed continuum mm-dust
emission and the spatially resolved CO (J=3-2) and HCO+ (J=4-3) emission. The
radial distributions of the H13CO+ and HC15N emission show hints of ringed
sub-structure whereas, the optically thick tracers, CO and HCO+, do not. We
calculate the HCO+/H13CO+ intensity ratio across the disk and find that it is
radially constant (within our uncertainties). We use a physio-chemical
parametric disk structure of the HD97048 disk with an analytical prescription
for the HCO+ abundance distribution to generate synthetic observations of the
HCO+ and H13CO+ disk emission assuming LTE. The best by-eye fit models require
radial variations in the HCO+/H13CO+ abundance ratio and an overall enhancement
in H13CO+ relative to HCO+. This highlights the need to consider isotope
selective chemistry and in particular low temperature carbon isotope exchange
reactions. This also points to the presence of a reservoir of cold molecular
gas in the outer disk (T < 10K, R > 200au). Chemical models are required to
confirm that isotope-selective chemistry alone can explain the observations
presented here. With these data, we cannot rule out that the known dust
substructure in the HD97048 disk is responsible for the observed trends in
molecular line emission, and higher spatial resolution observations are
required to fully explore the potential of optically thin tracers to probe
planet-carved dust gaps. We also report non-detections of H13CO+ and HC15N in

is important is the different regions of space that can be explored by magnetic

reconnection theories made the assumption that the reconnected magnetic flux

in three dimensional systems because an ideal evolution can cause magnetic

graph-based encoders. In all examples, the numerical results show near-tight
upper and lower bounds that can be easily converted to analytic results. For
the non-symmetric Trapdoor channel and binary fading channels (BFCs), new

all other instances, including the Ising channel, the near-tightness of the

strong viscoelastic dissipation inside the solid. A detailed understanding of
the spreading dynamics has remained elusive, partly owing to the difficulty in
quantifying the strong viscoelastic deformations below the contact line that
determine the shape of moving wetting ridges. Here we present direct
experimental visualisations of the dynamic wetting ridge, complemented with
measurements of the liquid contact angle. It is observed that the wetting ridge
exhibits a rotation that follows exactly the dynamic liquid contact angle -- as
was previously hypothesized [Karpitschka \emph{et al.} Nature Communications
\textbf{6}, 7891 (2015)]. This experimentally proves that, despite the contact
line motion, the wetting ridge is still governed by Neumann's law. Furthermore,
our experiments suggest that moving contact lines lead to a variable surface
tension of the substrate. We therefore set up a new theory that incorporates
the influence of surface strain, for the first time including the so-called
Shuttleworth effect into the dynamical theory for soft wetting. It includes a
detailed analysis of the boundary conditions at the contact line, complemented
by a dissipation analysis, which shows, again, the validity of Neumann's

image feature space and the semantic space, whilst it is important to learn
discriminative features and comprise the coarse-to-fine image feature and

autoencoder with a regressor feedback model for ZSL. The encoder learns a
mapping from the image feature space to the discriminative embedding space,
which regulates both inter-class and intra-class distances between the learned
features by a margin, making the learned features be discriminative for object
recognition. The regressor feedback learns to map the reconstructed samples
back to the the discriminative embedding and the semantic embedding, assisting
the decoder to improve the quality of the samples and provide a generalization

Discrepancies between predictions of the main isotopic species and the ALMA

determined by the coupling. The $00$-component of this tensor can be bounded
even if the canonical energy of the model is unbounded before the inclusion of
interaction. If the $00$-component of conserved tensor is bounded, the theory

sample from a complicated distribution, and is trusted to be intractable on

chain Monte Carlo method is an important approach to the simulation and
validation of boson sampling. This method however suffers from the severe
sample loss issue caused by the autocorrelation of the sample sequence.
Addressing this, we propose the sample caching Markov chain Monte Carlo method
that eliminates the correlations among the samples, and prevents the sample
loss at the meantime, allowing more efficient simulation of boson sampling.
Moreover, our method can be used as a general sampling framework that can
benefit a wide range of sampling tasks, and is particularly suitable for

It emitted
bright X-ray outbursts with peak luminosity up to $\sim 10^{39}$ erg/s during
the first years after its discovery in 1977. Since then, it was always seen in
quiescence or during outbursts with $L_x \lesssim 4 \times 10^{37}$ erg/s. In
2018 we carried out XMM-Newton observations of A0538-66 during three
consecutive orbits when the pulsar was close to periastron. In the first two
observations we discovered a remarkable variability, with flares of typical
durations between $\sim$2-50 s and peak luminosities up to $\sim 4\times
10^{38}$ erg/s (0.2-10 keV). Between the flares the luminosity was $\sim
2\times 10^{35}$ erg/s. The flares were absent in the third observation, during
which A0538-66 had a steady luminosity of $2\times 10^{34}$ erg/s. In all
observations, the X-ray spectra consist of a softer component, well described
by an absorbed power law with photon index $\Gamma_1\approx 2-4$ and
$N_H\approx 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, plus a harder power-law component
($\Gamma_2\approx 0-0.5$) dominating above $\sim$2 keV. The softer component
shows larger flux variations than the harder one, and a moderate hardening
correlated with the luminosity. The fast flaring activity seen in these
observations was never observed before in A0538-66, nor, to our best knowledge,
in other Be/XRBs. We explore the possibility that during our observations the
source was accreting in a regime of nearly spherically symmetric inflow. In
this case, an atmosphere can form around the neutron star magnetosphere and the
observed variability can be explained by transitions between the accretion and
supersonic propeller regimes.

similarly to amortized inference but produces three distinct amortized

calculation. At runtime, samples are produced separately from each amortized

show that while existing approaches are fundamentally limited in the level of

errors for any integrable target function using only a single sample from each

the theoretically optimal self-normalized importance sampler on a number of

literature in recent years for solving multi-label classification tasks,
including classifier chains where predictions are cascaded to other models as
additional features. The idea of extending this chaining methodology to
multi-output regression has already been suggested and trialed: regressor
chains. However, this has so-far been limited to greedy inference and has
provided relatively poor results compared to individual models, and of limited
applicability. In this paper we identify and discuss the main limitations,
including an analysis of different base models, loss functions, explainability,

limitations we study and develop methods for regressor chains. In particular we
present a sequential Monte Carlo scheme in the framework of a probabilistic
regressor chain, and we show it can be effective, flexible and useful in
several types of data. We place regressor chains in context in general terms of
multi-output learning with continuous outputs, and in doing this shed
additional light on classifier chains.

eavesdropping and tampering. Past work has demonstrated that DNS queries can
reveal a user's browsing history and even what smart devices they are using at
home. In response to these privacy concerns, two new protocols have been
proposed: DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT). Instead of sending DNS
queries and responses in the clear, DoH and DoT establish encrypted connections
between users and resolvers. By doing so, these protocols provide privacy and
security guarantees that traditional DNS (Do53) lacks.
  In this paper, we measure the effect of Do53, DoT, and DoH on query response
times and page load times from five global vantage points. We find that
although DoH and DoT response times are generally higher than Do53, both
protocols can perform better than Do53 in terms of page load times. However, as
throughput decreases and substantial packet loss and latency are introduced,
web pages load fastest with Do53. Additionally, web pages successfully load

several recommendations to improve DNS performance, such as opportunistic

number of different visual environments that they expect to be able to access

animal systems in several qualitative aspects, including cohesion, co-alignment

multi-layered neural network trained on simulated trajectories is shown to
represent a heuristic mimicking FSM. Similar levels of reasoning would seem to
be accessible under animal cognition, demonstrating a possible route to the

subsequently uses exact calculations. LARS was proposed as an efficient
algorithm for parameter estimation and variable selection for the normal linear
model. The LARS algorithm is described in terms of Euclidean geometry regarding
the correlation as the metric of the parameter space. Since the LARS algorithm
only works in Euclidean space, we transform a manifold of the statistical model
into the tangent space at the origin. In the generalized linear regression,
this transformation allows us to run the original LARS algorithm for the
generalized linear models. The proposed methods are efficient and perform well.
Real-data analysis indicates that the proposed methods output similar results
to that of the $l_1$-regularized maximum likelihood estimation for the
aforementioned models. Numerical experiments reveal that our methods work well
and they may be better than the $l_1$-regularization in generalization,
parameter estimation, and model selection.

Particle Dynamics simulations. In bulk and flat geometries the ABC stars form
hexagonal tilings, but this is topologically prohibited in a spherical geometry
which normally is alleviated by forming pentagonal tiles. However, the
molecular architecture of the ABC stars implies an additional 'color
constraint' which only allows even tilings (where all polygons have an even
number of edges) and we study the effect of these simultaneous constraints. We
find that both ABC and ABB systems form spherical tiling patterns, the type of
which depends on the radius of the spherical substrate. For small spherical
substrates, all solutions correspond to patterns solving the Thomson problem of
placing mobile repulsive electric charges on a sphere. In ABC systems we find
three coexisting, possibly different tilings, one in each color, each of them
solving the Thomson problem simultaneously. For all except the smallest
substrates, we find competing solutions with seemingly degenerate free energies
that occur with different probabilities. Statistically, an observer who is
blind to the differences between B and C can tell from the structure of the A

an associated cubic equation (spectral curve), one of whose solutions can be
expressed in terms of the Cauchy transform of the limiting eigenvalue
distribution. This is our starting point: we show that to any such spectral
curve (not necessarily given by a random matrix ensemble) it corresponds a
unique vector-valued measure with three components on the complex plane,
characterized as a solution of a variational problem stated in terms of their
logarithmic energy. We describe all possible geometries of the supports of
these measures; in particular the third component, if non-trivial, lives on a
contour on the plane. This general result is applied to the random matrix model
with external source, under an additional assumption of uniform boundedness of
the zeros of a sequence of average characteristic polynomials in the large
matrix limit. It is shown that any limiting zero distribution for such a
sequence can be written in terms of a solution of a spectral curve, and thus
admits the variational description obtained in the first part of the paper. As
a consequence of our analysis, we obtain that the density of this limiting
measure can have only a handful of local behaviors: sine, Airy and their higher
order type behavior, Pearcey or yet the fifth power of the cubic (but no higher
order cubics can appear). We also compare our findings with the most general
results available in the literature, showing that once an additional symmetry
is imposed, our vector critical measure contains enough information to recover
the solutions to the constrained equilibrium problem that was known to describe
the limiting eigenvalue distribution in this symmetric situation.

minimize the completion time of the last job. Usually, precedence constraints
are given by a partial order on the set of jobs, and each job requires all its
predecessors to be completed before it can start. In his seminal paper, Graham
(1966) presented a simple 2-approximation algorithm, and, more than 40 years
later, Svensson (2010) proved that 2 is essentially the best approximation
ratio one can hope for in general. In this paper, we consider a different type
of precedence relation that has not been discussed as extensively and is called
OR-precedence. In order for a job to start, we require that at least one of its
predecessors is completed - in contrast to all its predecessors. Additionally,
we assume that each job has a release date before which it must not start. We
prove that Graham's algorithm has an approximation guarantee of 2 also in this
setting, and present a polynomial-time algorithm that solves the problem to
optimality, if preemptions are allowed. The latter result is in contrast to
classical precedence constraints, for which Ullman (1975) showed that the
preemptive variant is already NP-hard. Our algorithm generalizes a result of
Johannes (2005) who gave a polynomial-time algorithm for unit processing time
jobs subject to OR-precedence constraints, but without release dates. The
performance guarantees presented here match the best-known ones for special
cases where classical precedence constraints and OR-precedence constraints

instrumental in enabling mission-critical decentralized systems, such as

aggravated under wireless connectivity that may be slower and less reliable,

relationships between consensus latency and reliability through the lens of
wireless connectivity, and co-design communication and consensus protocols for

novel communication-efficient distributed consensus protocol, termed Random
Representative Consensus (R2C), and show its effectiveness under gossip and
broadcast communication protocols. To this end, we derive a closed-form
end-to-end (E2E) latency expression of the R2C that guarantees a target
reliability, and compare it with a baseline consensus protocol, referred to as
Referendum Consensus (RC). The result shows that the R2C is faster compared to
the RC and more reliable compared when co-designed with the broadcast protocol

variability in terms of location, size, intensity and form, making automatic

methods by exploiting the bilateral quasi-symmetry of healthy brains, which
breaks down when lesions are present. Specifically, we use nonlinear
registration of a neuroimage to a reflected version of itself (""reflective
registration"") to determine for each voxel its homologous (corresponding) voxel
in the other hemisphere. A patch around the homologous voxel is added as a set
of new features to the segmentation algorithm. To evaluate this method, we
implemented two different CNN-based multimodal MRI stroke lesion segmentation
algorithms, and then augmented them by adding extra symmetry features using the
reflective registration method described above. For each architecture, we
compared the performance with and without symmetry augmentation, on the SISS
Training dataset of the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation Challenge (ISLES)
2015 challenge. Using affine reflective registration improves performance over
baseline, but nonlinear reflective registration gives significantly better
results: an improvement in Dice coefficient of 13 percentage points over
baseline for one architecture and 9 points for the other. We argue for the
broad applicability of adding symmetric features to existing segmentation
algorithms, specifically using nonlinear, template-free methods.

yet at the same time, noise unravels properties that are inaccessible at the
level of the averaged signal. In electronic devices, shot noise arises from the
discrete nature of charge carriers and it increases linearly with the applied
voltage according to the celebrated Schottky formula. Nonetheless, measurements
of shot noise in atomic-scale junctions at high voltage reveal significant
nonlinear (anomalous) behavior, which varies from sample to sample, and has no
specific trend. Here, we provide a viable, unifying explanation for these
diverse observations based on the theory of quantum coherent transport. Our
formula for the anomalous shot noise relies on---and allows us to resolve---two
key characteristics of a conducting junction: The structure of the transmission
function at the vicinity of the Fermi energy and the asymmetry of the bias
voltage drop at the contacts. We tested our theory on high voltage shot noise
measurements on Au atomic scale junctions and demonstrated a quantitative
agreement, recovering both the enhancement and suppression of shot noise as
observed in different junctions. The good theory-experiment correspondence
supports our modelling and emphasizes that the asymmetry of the bias drop on
the contacts is a key factor in nanoscale electronic transport, which may
substantially impact electronic signals even in incomplex structures.

by the heterogeneity. In this paper, we investigate the problem of exploiting
heterogeneous side information for recommendations. Specifically, we propose a
novel framework jointly captures flat and hierarchical side information with
mathematical coherence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

parameters such as the Hubble parameter and deceleration parameter are derived,
from which expressions of pressure, density and Equation of State (EoS)
parameter and a qualitative understanding of the initial conditions of the
universe at the bounce are ascertained. We found that the initial conditions of
the universe are finite owing to the non-vanishing nature of the scale factor
thus eliminates the initial singularity problem. Furthermore, we show the
violation of energy conditions near the bouncing region and analyzed the
stability of our model with respect to linear homogeneous perturbations in
Friedmann-Lema\^tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. We found that our model
and hence matter bounce scenarios in general are highly unstable at the bounce
in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity but the perturbations decay out rapidly
away from the bounce safeguarding its stability at late times.

well-beyond existing approaches, without compromising much accuracy. Our key
insight is that we can integrate an optimization-based abstraction refinement
loop into the learning process and operate over dynamically constructed
partitions of the input space that considers accuracy and safety objectives
synergistically. The refinement procedure iteratively splits the input space
from which training data is drawn, guided by the efficacy with which such

classification of traffic signs, but in our experiments it does not reach high
accuracy, and we believe this is due to lack of data, requiring data
augmentation. Generative adversarial networks can learn the high dimensional
distribution of empirical data, allowing the generation of new data points. In
this paper we apply pix2pix GANs architecture to generate new traffic sign
images and evaluate the use of these images in data augmentation. We were
motivated to use pix2pix to translate symbolic sign images to real ones due to
the mode collapse in Conditional GANs. Through our experiments we found that
data augmentation using GAN can increase classification accuracy for circular
traffic signs from 92.1% to 94.0%, and for triangular traffic signs from 93.8%
to 95.3%, producing an overall improvement of 2%. However some traditional
augmentation techniques can outperform GAN data augmentation, for example
contrast variation in circular traffic signs (95.5%) and displacement on
triangular traffic signs (96.7 %). Our negative results shows that while GANs
can be naively used for data augmentation, they are not always the best choice,
depending on the problem and variability in the data.

  Case Study",,"2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering","10.1109/ICDE.2019.00208",,"cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning representation has been proven to be helpful in numerous machine
learning tasks. The success of the majority of existing representation learning
approaches often requires a large amount of consistent and noise-free labels.
However, labels are not accessible in many real-world scenarios and they are
usually annotated by the crowds. In practice, the crowdsourced labels are
usually inconsistent among crowd workers given their diverse expertise and the
number of crowdsourced labels is very limited. Thus, directly adopting
crowdsourced labels for existing representation learning algorithms is
inappropriate and suboptimal. In this paper, we investigate the above problem
and propose a novel framework of \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{L}earning with
crowdsourced \textbf{L}abels, i.e., ""RLL"", which learns representation of data
with crowdsourced labels by jointly and coherently solving the challenges
introduced by limited and inconsistent labels. The proposed representation
learning framework is evaluated in two real-world education applications. The
experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our approach on learning
representation from limited labeled data from the crowds, and show RLL is able
to outperform state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, detailed experiments are
conducted on RLL to fully understand its key components and the corresponding
performance.

developed, modeled numerically, and experimentally tested on a number of
commercial supercapacitors. It consists in shorting a supercapacitor for a
short time $\tau$, then switching to the open circuit regime and measuring an
initial rebound and long-time relaxation. The results obtained are: the ratio
of ""easy"" and ""hard"" to access capacitance and the dependence $C(\tau)$, that
determines what the capacitance the system responds at time-scale $\tau$; it
can be viewed as an alternative to used by some manufacturers approach to
characterize a supercapacitor by fixed capacitance and time-scale dependent
internal resistance. Among the advantages of proposed technique is that it does
not require a source of fixed current, what simplifies the setup and allows a
high discharge current regime. The approach can be used as a replacement of
low-frequency impedance measurements and the ones of IEC 62391 type, it can be
effectively applied to characterization of supercapacitors and other relaxation
type systems with porous internal structure. The technique can be completely
automated by a microcontroller to measure, analyze, and output the results.

monitor network component behavior to detect unusual activity (i.e., possible

used for decades via TCP/IP protocol to manage network devices. Raw data
security evaluation in intrusion detection incurs latency in detection.
Management Information Base (MIB) combined with SNMP is a solution for this,
the traditional approach of SNMP is centralized. Thus, rendering it unreliable
and non-adaptive to network changes when it comes to distributed network. In
distributed network, using single or multiple light Mobile Agents are an
optimal solution for data gathering as they can move from one source node to
another, executing naturally at each. This helps complete tasks without
increasing the network overheads, and contributes to decreasing latency
