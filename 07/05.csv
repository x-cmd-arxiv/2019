material macroscopic behavior and in predictions of its effective properties. A
common approach to modeling random multiphase materials is to develop so-called
surrogate models approximating statistical features of the material. However,
the surrogate models used in fatigue analysis usually employ simple
microstructure, consisting of ideal geometries such as ellipsoidal inclusions,
which generally does not capture complex geometries. In this paper, we
introduce a simple but flexible surrogate microstructure model for two-phase
materials through a level-cut of a Gaussian random field with covariance of
Mat\'ern class. Such parametrization of the covariance function allows for the
representation of a few key design parameters while representing the geometry
of inclusions in a more general setting for a large class of random
heterogeneous two-phase media. In addition to the traditional morphology
descriptors such as porosity, size and aspect ratio, it provides control of the
regularity of the inclusions interface and sphericity. These parameters are
estimated from a small number of real material images using Bayesian inversion.
An efficient process of evaluating the samples, based on the Fast Fourier
Transform, makes possible the use of Monte-Carlo methods to estimate
statistical properties for the quantities of interest in a given material
class. We demonstrate the overall framework of the use of the surrogate
material model in application to the uncertainty quantification in fatigue
analysis, its feasibility and efficiency, and its role in the microstructure
design.

prosodic features per phoneme, injecting them into a sequence-to-sequence

this issue of congestion in RACH mechanism, 3GPP has proposed an extended
access barring (3GPP-EAB) mechanism. However, several works indicate that the
performance of the 3GPP-EAB mechanism can be further improved. In this work, a
successive interference cancellation (SIC) based RACH mechanism is considered
to significantly increase the success rate and reduce congestion. In the
proposed mechanism, the devices are allowed to transmit repeatedly for a finite
number of times in a given cycle, and thereafter, the success rate is improved
by applying back-and-forth SIC at the BS. A novel probabilistic approach of the
proposed mechanism is presented with all transition and steady-state
probabilities. Further, the probability of SIC for a given slot is derived.
Through extensive numerical results, it is shown that the proposed mechanism
significantly outperforms the existing ones in terms of the success rate.
Moreover, to obtain the maximum success rate, the optimum number of devices to

annihilation channels and dark matter masses, we compare yields obtained with
Pythia8 and Herwig7 of all of the aforementioned secondary particle species. We

importance of including polarisation effects in searches for neutrinos from

violations at the underlying quark and gluon level. Chiral perturbation theory
provides a method for translating novel operators that may appear in the
Lagrange density for color-charged parton fields into equivalent forms for
effective theories at the meson and baryon levels. We extend the application of
this technique to the study of Lorentz-violating and potentially CPT-violating
operators from the minimal standard model extension. For dimension-4 operators,
there are nontrivial relations between the coefficients of baryon-level
operators related to underlying quark and gluon operators with the same Lorentz
structures. Moreover, in the mapping of the dimension-3 operators from the
quark and gluon level to the hadron level (considered here for the first time),
many of the hadronic observables contain no new low-energy coupling constants
at all, which makes it possible to make direct translations of bounds derived

representative of the instrumentation used for radio astronomical observations
in the frequency domain from 300 MHz to 116 GHz. A comprehensive description of

a novel enriched Dirichlet mixture model for functional data. Our proposal
accommodates the incorporation of functional constraints while bounding the

that does not admit a family of $k$ vertex-disjoint cycles contains a feedback
vertex set (a set of vertices hitting all cycles in the graph) of size $O(k
\log k)$. After being known for long as Younger's conjecture, a similar
statement for directed graphs has been proven in 1996 by Reed, Robertson,
Seymour, and Thomas. However, in their proof, the dependency of the size of the
feedback vertex set on the size of vertex-disjoint cycle packing is not
elementary.
  We show that if we compare the size of a minimum feedback vertex set in a
directed graph with the quarter-integral cycle packing number, we obtain a
polynomial bound. More precisely, we show that if in a directed graph $G$ there
is no family of $k$ cycles such that every vertex of $G$ is in at most four of
the cycles, then there exists a feedback vertex set in $G$ of size $O(k^4)$.
Furthermore, a variant of our proof shows that if in a directed graph $G$ there
is no family of $k$ cycles such that every vertex of $G$ is in at most two of
the cycles, then there exists a feedback vertex set in $G$ of size $O(k^6)$.
  On the way there we prove a more general result about quarter-integral
packing of subgraphs of high directed treewidth: for every pair of positive
integers $a$ and $b$, if a directed graph $G$ has directed treewidth
$\Omega(a^6 b^8 \log^2(ab))$, then one can find in $G$ a family of $a$
subgraphs, each of directed treewidth at least $b$, such that every vertex of
$G$ is in at most four subgraphs.

The task of 3D human pose estimation is a particularly interesting example of

effects of wall-roughness, is one of the outstanding questions in turbulence
research. In the standard Rayleigh-B\'enard problem for natural thermal
convection, it is notoriously difficult to reach the so-called ultimate regime
in which the near-wall boundary layers are turbulent. Following the analyses
proposed by Kraichnan [Phys. Fluids vol 5., pp. 1374-1389 (1962)] and Grossmann
& Lohse [Phys. Fluids vol. 23, pp. 045108 (2011)], we instead utilize recent
direct numerical simulations of forced convection over a rough wall in a
minimal channel [MacDonald, Hutchins & Chung, J. Fluid Mech. vol. 861, pp.
138--162 (2019)] to directly study these turbulent boundary layers. We focus on
the heat transport (in dimensionless form, the Nusselt number $Nu$) or
equivalently the heat transfer coefficient (the Stanton number $C_h$).
Extending the analyses of Kraichnan and Grossmann & Lohse, we assume
logarithmic temperature profiles with a roughness-induced shift to predict an
effective scaling of $Nu \sim Ra^{0.42}$, where $Ra$ is the dimensionless
temperature difference, corresponding to $C_h \sim Re^{-0.16}$, where $Re$ is
the centerline Reynolds number. This is pronouncedly different from the
skin-friction coefficient $C_f$, which in the fully rough turbulent regime is
independent of $Re$, due to the dominant pressure drag. In rough-wall
turbulence the absence of the analog to pressure drag in the temperature
advection equation is the origin for the very different scaling properties of
the heat transfer as compared to the momentum transfer. This analysis suggests
that, unlike momentum transfer, the asymptotic ultimate regime, where $Nu\sim
Ra^{1/2}$, will never be reached for heat transfer at finite $Ra$.

extensively studied due to various possible applications exploiting their large
amount of internal surface area. Phonon properties of MOFs are, however, still
largely unexplored, despite their relevance for thermal and electrical
conductivities, thermal expansion, and mechanical properties. Here, we use
quantum-mechanical simulations to provide an in-depth analysis of the phonon
properties of isoreticular MOFs. We consider phonon band structures, spatial
confinements of modes, projected densities of states, and group velocity
distributions. We find that more complex linkers shift the spectral weight of
the phonon density of states towards higher frequencies, while increasing the
mass of the metal atoms in the nodes has the opposite effect. Due to the high
porosity of MOFs, we observe a particularly pronounced polarization dependence
of the dispersion of acoustic phonons with rather high group velocities for
longitudinal acoustic modes. Interestingly, also for several optical phonon
modes group velocities amounting to several thousand m/s are obtained. For
heterogeneous systems like MOFs, correlating group velocities and the
displacement of modes is particularly relevant. Here we find that high group
velocities are generally associated with delocalized vibrations, while the
inverse correlation does not necessarily hold. To quantify anharmonicities, we
calculate mode Gr\""uneisen parameters, which we find to be significant only for
phonons with frequencies below ~3 THz. The presented results provide the
foundations for an in-depth understanding of the vibrational properties of MOF,

consider the recovery of a target signal with the aid of a correlated signal,
the so-called side information (SI), and propose a deep unfolding model that

multimodal data at a low computational cost. As such, our work introduces the
first deep unfolding method with SI, which actually comes from a different

demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework against
single-modal deep learning methods that do not use SI, multimodal deep learning

output such that the boundary conditions associated with the problem are
exactly satisfied. Compared to conventional residual based PINN, the proposed
approach has two major advantages. First, the imposition of boundary conditions
is relatively simpler and more robust. Second, the order of derivatives present
in the functional form of the variational energy is of lower order than in the
residual form. Hence, training the network is faster. To compute the total
variational energy of the system, an efficient scheme that takes as input a
geometry described by spline based CAD model and employs Gauss quadrature rules
for numerical integration has been proposed. Moreover, we utilize the concept
of transfer learning to obtain the crack path in an efficient manner. The
proposed approach is used to solve four fracture mechanics problems. For all
the examples, results obtained using the proposed approach match closely with
the results available in the literature. For the first two examples, we compare
the results obtained using the proposed approach with the conventional residual

symmetry in metals. We also derive a quantum rectification sum rule in time
reversal invariant materials by showing that the integral over frequency of the
rectification conductivity depends solely on the Berry connection and not on
the band energies. The intraband spectral weight of this sum rule is exhausted
by the Berry curvature dipole Drude-like peak, and the interband weight is also
entirely controlled by the Berry connection. This sum rule opens a door to
search for alternative photovoltaic technologies based on the Berry geometry of

trajectory on flat space implies a violation of the Higuchi bound (a unitarity
bound on the mass of higher-spin particles in de Sitter space), the curved

Interestingly, as a consequence of accelerated expansion, there exists a
maximum spin for each Regge trajectory, which is helpful to make the spectrum
consistent with the Higuchi bound, but at the same time, it could be an
obstruction to stringy UV completion based on an infinite higher-spin tower. By
pushing further this observation, we demonstrate that the vacuum energy $V$

$V\lesssim M_s^4$, if UV completion is achieved with the leading Regge
trajectory of higher spin states up to the 4D Planck scale. Its application to

resolved in all galaxies, with physical extents of 3.2-5.4 kpc. The dust
continuum is on-average 40% more compact, which results in larger [CII]

are fully consistent with those found at lower redshifts. Four of the galaxies
show [CII] velocity fields that are consistent with ordered rotation, while the
remaining six galaxies show no clear velocity gradient. All galaxies have high
(~80-200 km/s) velocity dispersions, consistent with the interpretation that
the interstellar medium (ISM) of these high redshift galaxies is turbulent. By
fitting the galaxies with kinematic models, we estimate the dynamical mass of
these systems, which range between (0.3 -> 5.4) x 1E10 Msun. For the three
closest separation galaxy pairs, we observe dust and [CII] emission from gas in

interactions are disturbing the gas in these systems. Although gas exchange in
these tidal interactions could power luminous quasars, the existence of quasars
in host galaxies without nearby companions suggests that tidal interactions are
not the only viable method for fueling their active centers. These observations
corroborate the assertion that accreting supermassive black holes do not

systems are so different from our own solar system. But the last few years have
dramatically changed our view of the discs of gas and dust around young stars.
Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and
extreme adaptive-optics systems have revealed that most --- if not all ---
discs contain substructure, including rings and gaps, spirals, azimuthal dust
concentrations, and shadows cast by misaligned inner discs. These features have
been interpreted as signatures of newborn protoplanets, but the exact origin is
unknown. Here we report the kinematic detection of a few Jupiter-mass planet
located in a gas and dust gap at 130 au in the disc surrounding the young star
HD 97048. An embedded planet can explain both the disturbed Keplerian flow of
the gas, detected in CO lines, and the gap detected in the dust disc at the
same radius. While gaps appear to be a common feature in protoplanetary discs,
we present a direct correspondence between a planet and a dust gap, indicating
that at least some gaps are the result of planet-disc interactions.

with a simple normalization of the feature maps, a global operation that is

Normalization (ACN), a simple yet effective technique to build
permutation-equivariant networks robust to outliers. Specifically, we show how
to normalize the feature maps with weights that are estimated within the
network, excluding outliers from this normalization. We use this mechanism to
leverage two types of attention: local and global-by combining them, our method
is able to find the essential data points in high-dimensional space to solve a
given task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach,

to model high-redshift galaxy selection completeness. We find that galaxy

measurements will be $\sim$0.2 dex for faint (-18 $\gtrsim$

therefore provide the first constraints on the stellar-halo mass relation in
the epoch of reionization and substantially clarify how this relation evolves
at z$>$4. We also find that $\sim$1000 individual satellites will be

parties is a bipartite channel, as it is the basic element to construct all
quantum circuits. In general, bipartite channels can produce entangled states,
and can be used to simulate quantum operations that are not local. While much
effort over the last two decades has been devoted to the study of entanglement
of bipartite states, very little is known about the entanglement of bipartite
channels. In this work, we rigorously study the entanglement of bipartite
channels as a resource theory of quantum processes. We present an infinite and
complete family of measures of dynamical entanglement, which gives necessary
and sufficient conditions for convertibility under local operations and
classical communication. Then we focus on the dynamical resource theory where
free operations are positive partial transpose (PPT) superchannels, but we do
not assume that they are realized by PPT pre- and post-processing. This leads
to a greater mathematical simplicity that allows us to express all resource
protocols and the relevant resource measures in terms of semi-definite
programs. Along the way, we generalize the negativity from states to channels,
and introduce the max-logarithmic negativity, which has an operational
interpretation as the exact asymptotic entanglement cost of a bipartite
channel. Finally, we use the non-positive partial transpose (NPT) resource
theory to derive a no-go result: it is impossible to distill entanglement out
of bipartite PPT channels under any sets of free superchannels that can be used
in entanglement theory. This allows us to generalize one of the long-standing
open problems in quantum information - the NPT bound entanglement problem -
from bipartite states to bipartite channels. It further leads us to the
discovery of bound entangled POVMs.

shifting from classical definite marker theory to statistically context
situated conceptual theory. However, the role of context processing and its
interaction with the affect is still not comprehensively explored and modelled.
With the help of neural decoding of functional networks, we have decoded
cognitive functions for 12 different basic and complex emotion conditions.
Using transfer learning in deep neural architecture, we arrived at the
conclusion that the core affect is unable to provide varieties of emotions
unless coupled with cortical cognitive functions such as autobiographical
memory, dmn, self-referential, social, tom and salient event detection.
Following our results, in this article, we present a 'cognition-affect
integrated model of emotion' which includes many cortical and subcortical
regions and their interactions. Our model suggests three testable hypotheses.
First, affect and physiological sensations alone are inconsequential in
defining or classifying emotions until integrated with the domain-general
cognitive systems. Second, cognition and affect modulate each other throughout
the generation of meaningful instance which is situated in the current context.
And, finally, the structural and temporal hierarchies in the brain's
organization and anatomical projections play an important role in emotion
responses in terms of hierarchical activities and their durations. The model,
along with the analytical and anatomical support, is presented. The article
concludes with the future research questions.

  CogniCrypt",,,,"tr-ri-19-359","cs.PL cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background - Software companies increasingly rely on static analysis tools to
detect potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in their software products.
In the past decade, more and more commercial and open-source static analysis
tools have been developed and are maintained. Each tool comes with its own
reporting format, preventing an easy integration of multiple analysis tools in
a single interface, such as the Static Analysis Server Protocol (SASP). In
2017, a collaborative effort in industry, including Microsoft and GrammaTech,
has proposed the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) to address
this issue. SARIF is a standardized format in which static analysis warnings
can be encoded, to allow the import and export of analysis reports between
different tools.
  Purpose - This paper explains the SARIF format through examples and presents
a proof of concept of the connector that allows the static analysis tool
CogniCrypt to generate and export its results in SARIF format.
  Design/Approach - We conduct a cross-sectional study between the SARIF format
and CogniCrypt's output format before detailing the implementation of the
connector. The study aims to find the components of interest in CogniCrypt that
the SARIF export module can complete.
  Originality/Value - The integration of SARIF into CogniCrypt described in
this paper can be reused to integrate SARIF into other static analysis tools.
  Conclusion - After detailing the SARIF format, we present an initial
implementation to integrate SARIF into CogniCrypt. After taking advantage of
all the features provided by SARIF, CogniCrypt will be able to support SASP.

is unobtrusive and assists both squat and stoops while not impeding walking
motion. To tackle the challenge of the unique anatomy of spine that is
inappropriate to be simplified as a single degree of freedom joint, our robot
is conformal to human anatomy and it can reduce multiple types of forces along
the human spine such as the spinae muscle force, shear, and compression force
of the lumbar vertebrae. We derived kinematics and kinetics models of this
mechanism and established an analytical biomechanics model of human-robot
interaction. Quantitative analysis of disc compression force, disc shear force
and muscle force was performed in simulation. We further developed a virtual
impedance control strategy to deliver force control and compensate hysteresis
of Bowden cable transmission. The feasibility of the prototype was
experimentally tested on three healthy subjects. The root mean square error of
force tracking is 6.63 N (3.3 % of the 200N peak force) and it demonstrated
that it can actively control the stiffness to the desired value. This continuum
soft exoskeleton represents a feasible solution with the potential to reduce

Traditional multilevel models involve hierarchical data structures whereby
lower level units such as students are nested within higher level units such as
schools and where these higher level units may in turn be nested within further
groupings or clusters such as school districts, regions, and countries. With
hierarchical data structures, there is an exact nesting of each lower level
unit in one and only one higher level unit. For example, each student attends
one school, each school is located within one school district, and so on.
However, social reality is more complicated than this, and so social and
behavioural data often do not follow pure or strict hierarchies. Two types of
non-hierarchical data structures which often appear in practice are
cross-classified and multiple membership structures. In this article, we
describe cross-classified data structures and cross-classified hierarchical

there is an associated presheaf topos of $(X,M)$-graphs where each object can

cardinality $\#X$ incident vertices (including multiplicity) and where the

be a standard method in time series analysis and signal processing in the
future. Moreover, the problems solved by SSA are considerably wider than that
for principal component analysis. In particular, the problems of frequency
estimation, forecasting and missing values imputation can be solved within the
framework of SSA. The idea of SSA came from different scientific communities,
such as that of researchers in time series analysis (Karhunen-Loeve
decomposition), signal processing (low-rank approximation and frequency
estimation) and multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis).
Also, depending on the area of applications, different viewpoints on the same
algorithms, choice of parameters, and methodology as a whole are considered.
Thus, the aim of the paper is to describe and compare different viewpoints on
SSA and its modifications and extensions to give people from different

the ability to harness petascale resources to study materials and alloys

foundations, strong coupling in nanophotonics has experienced increasing
popularity in recent years. With nanophotonics being an experiment-driven
field, the absence of appropriate theoretical methods to describe
ground-breaking advances has often emerged as an important issue. To address
this problem, the temptation to directly transfer and extend concepts already
available from quantum optics is strong, even if a rigorous justification is
not always available. In this Review we discuss situations where, in our view,
this strategy has indeed overstepped its bounds. We focus on exciton--plasmon
interactions, and particularly on the idea of calculating the number of
excitons involved in the coupling. We analyse how, starting from an unfounded
interpretation of the term N/V that appears in theoretical descriptions at
different levels of complexity, one might be tempted to make independent
assumptions for what the number N and the volume V are, and attempt to
calculate them separately. Such an approach can lead to different, often
contradictory results, depending on the initial assumptions (e.g. through
different treatments of $V$ as the -- ambiguous in plasmonics -- mode volume).
We argue that the source of such contradictions is the question itself -- How
many excitons are coupled?, which disregards the true nature of the coupled
components of the system, has no meaning and often not even any practical
importance. If one is interested in validating the quantum nature of the system
-- which appears to be the motivation driving the pursuit of strong coupling
with small N -- one could instead focus on quantities such as the photon
emission rate or the second-order correlation function.

bright foreground emission presents a significant impediment to its unbiased
recovery from interferometric data. We build on the Bayesian power spectral
estimation methodology introduced in Sims et al. 2016 and demonstrate that
incorporating a priori knowledge of the spectral structure of foregrounds in
the large spectral scale component of the data model enables significantly
improved modelling of the foregrounds without increasing the model complexity.
We explore two astrophysically motivated parametrisations of the large spectral
scale model: (i) a constant plus power law model of the form
$q_{0}+q_{1}(\nu/\nu_{0})^{b_{1}}$ for two values of $b_{1}$: $b_{1} =
<\beta>_\mathrm{GDSE}$ and $b_{1} = <\beta>_\mathrm{EGS}$, the mean spectral

estimate the EoR power spectrum from simulated interferometric data consisting
of an EoR signal, Galactic diffuse synchrotron emission, extragalactic sources
and diffuse free-free emission from the Galaxy. We show that, by jointly
estimating a model of the EoR signal with the constant plus double power law
parametrisation of the large spectral scale model, unbiased estimates of the

characterized by two parameters

used to extract information about the direction and magnitude of the tilt.

networks that are robust against adversarial, norm-bounded perturbations.
However, the computational cost of adversarial training grows prohibitively as
the size of the model and number of input dimensions increase. Further,
training against less expensive and therefore weaker adversaries produces
models that are robust against weak attacks but break down under attacks that
are stronger. This is often attributed to the phenomenon of gradient
obfuscation; such models have a highly non-linear loss surface in the vicinity
of training examples, making it hard for gradient-based attacks to succeed even
though adversarial examples still exist. In this work, we introduce a novel
regularizer that encourages the loss to behave linearly in the vicinity of the
training data, thereby penalizing gradient obfuscation while encouraging
robustness. We show via extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, that
models trained with our regularizer avoid gradient obfuscation and can be
trained significantly faster than adversarial training. Using this regularizer,
we exceed current state of the art and achieve 47% adversarial accuracy for

the vibrational free energy using the Einstein crystal as a reference for the

This methodology has the advantage that it does not require a crystalline solid
phase for separating the entropies. Therefore, in principle, it is applicable
to any material, regardless of whether or not it has a crystalline phase. Using
this methodology, we separate the vibrational and configurational entropies of
two metallic glasses with different fragilities at zero external pressure,

analysing the constitution and physical properties of small bodies in the Solar
System. Currently, two space missions (Hayabusa2, OSIRIS-REx) have recently
arrived at their respective targets and will bring a sample of the asteroids
back to Earth. Other small body missions have also been selected by, or
proposed to, space agencies. The threat posed to our planet by near-Earth
objects (NEOs) is also considered at the international level, and this has
prompted dedicated research on possible mitigation techniques. The DART
mission, for example, will test the kinetic impact technique. Even ideas for
industrial exploitation have risen during the last years. Lastly, the origin of
water and life on Earth appears to be connected to asteroids. Hence, future
space mission projects will undoubtedly target some asteroids or other SSSBs.

mechanical behaviour of the surface as well as the bulk of those celestial

large proportion of such small bodies is believed to consist of gravitational
aggregates ('rubble piles') with no -- or low -- internal cohesion, with
varying macro-porosity and surface properties (from smooth regolith covered
terrain, to very rough collection of boulders), and varying topography
(craters, depressions, ridges) [...].

where dark energy (DE) corresponds to a light scalar meson particle $\phi$
dynamically formed at a condensation energy scale $\Lambda_c$. The evolution of
this dark-energy meson is determined by the potential
$V(\phi)=\Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, with a distinguishing phenomenology
from other quintessence scenarios. Particularly, the expansion rate of the
universe is affected not only at late times, but also when the condensation of
$\phi$ occurs, which in linear theory leads to an enhancement (with respect to
standard $\Lambda$CDM) of matter perturbations on small scales. We study how
much of this signature is still present at late times as well as the properties
of dark matter halos in the nonlinear regime through N-body simulations. Our
results show that nonlinear corrections wash out this feature from the matter
power spectrum even before DE becomes dominant. There is, however, a small but
clear suppression of the BDE spectrum of $2\%$ today on the largest scales due
to the distinct late-time dynamics of DE. The differences on the clustering
power between BDE and $\Lambda$CDM are reflected in the halo mass function,
where small halos are more abundant in BDE as opposed to large heavy
structures, whose formation is delayed because of the expansion history of the
universe. This result is well captured by the semi-analytical Sheth-Tormen
formula. However, despite these differences, the halo concentration parameter
is essentially the same in both models, which suggest that clustering inside
the halos decouple from the general expansion once the halos form.

the B$_{1g}$ phonon softens by a few percent, and a lattice instability with
concomitant finite-range charge-density wave correlations will form locally, if
nucleated by defects or dopant disorder. These results offer the perspective

introduce a notion of Euler type partial differential equation. To such a PDE
we associate an indicial conic, which is an affine plane curve of degree two.
Then comes the concept of regular singularity and finally convergence theorems,
which must necessarily take into account the type of PDE (parabolic, elliptical
or hyperbolic) and a nonresonance condition. This condition gives a new
geometric interpretation of the original condition between the roots of the
original Frobenius theorem for second order ODEs. The interpretation is
something like, a certain reticulate has or not vertices on the indexical
conic. Finally, we retrieve the solution of all the classical PDEs by this
method (heat diffusion, wave propagation and Laplace equation), and also
increase the class of those that have explicit algorithmic solution to far
beyond those admitting separable variables. The last part of the paper is
dedicated to the construction of PDE models for the classical ODEs like Airy,
Legendre, Laguerre, Hermite and Chebyshev by two different means. One model is
based on the requirement that the restriction of the PDE to lines through the
origin must be the classical ODE model. The second is based on the idea of
having symmetries on the PDE model and imitating the ODE model. We study these

predicts the final mass of a giant planet born in a given disk, by adding the
disk mass loss due to photoevaporation and a new type II migration formula to
our previous model. The proposed model provides some interesting results.
First, it gives universal evolution tracks in the diagram of planetary mass and
orbital radius, which clarifies how giant planets migrate at growth in the
runaway gas accretion stage. Giant planets with a few Jupiter masses or less
suffer only a slight radial migration in the runaway gas accretion stage.
Second, the final mass of giant planets is approximately given as a function of
only three parameters: the initial disk mass at the starting time of runaway
gas accretion onto the planet, the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation, and
the starting time. On the other hand, the final planet mass is almost
independent of the disk radius, viscosity, and initial orbital radius. The
obtained final planet mass is similar to or less than 10% of the initial disk
mass. Third, the proposed model successfully explains properties in the mass
distribution of giant exoplanets with the mass distribution of observed
protoplanetary disks for a reasonable range of the mass loss rate due to
photoevaporation.

unstable manifold of a periodic solution is completely contained in its stable
manifold is codimension-two. Unlike codimension-one homoclinic corners, such
`subsumed' homoclinic connections can be associated with stable periodic
solutions. The purpose of this paper is to determine the dynamics near a
generic subsumed homoclinic connection in two dimensions. Assuming the
eigenvalues associated with the periodic solution satisfy $0 < |\lambda| < 1 <
\sigma < \frac{1}{|\lambda|}$, in a two-parameter unfolding there exists an
infinite sequence of roughly triangular regions within which the map has a
stable single-round periodic solution. The result applies to both discontinuous

the border-collision bifurcations that correspond to boundaries of the regions.
The result is illustrated with a discontinuous map of Mira and the

hyperbolic wave propagation problems. As a result of the complexities of real
geometries, internal interfaces and nonlinear boundary and interface
conditions, discontinuities and sharp wave fronts may become fundamental
features of the solution. Thus, geometrically flexible and adaptive numerical
algorithms are critical for high fidelity and efficient simulations of wave
phenomena in many applications. Adaptive curvilinear meshes hold promise to
minimise the effort to represent complicated geometries or heterogeneous
material data avoiding the bottleneck of feature-preserving meshing. To enable
the design of stable DG methods on three space dimensional (3D) curvilinear
elements we construct a structure preserving anti-symmetric coordinate
transformation motivated by the underlying physics. Using a physics-based
numerical penalty-flux, we develop a 3D provably energy-stable discontinuous
Galerkin finite element approximation of the elastic wave equation in
geometrically complex and heterogenous media. By construction, our numerical
flux is upwind and yields a discrete energy estimate analogous to the
continuous energy estimate. The ability to treat conforming and non-conforming
curvilinear elements allows for flexible adaptive mesh refinement strategies.
The numerical scheme has been implemented in ExaHyPE, a simulation engine for
parallel dynamically adaptive simulations of wave problems on adaptive
Cartesian meshes. We present 3D numerical experiments of wave propagation in
heterogeneous isotropic and anisotropic elastic solids demonstrating stability
and high order accuracy. We demonstrate the potential of our approach for
computational seismology in a regional wave propagation scenario in a
geologically constrained 3D model including the geometrically complex

coherent variations in the recorded clock frequency comparisons across the

the fine structure constant. For example, we constrain the variation in alpha
to <5*10^-17 for transients of duration 10^3 s. This analysis also presents a
possibility to search for dark matter, the mysterious substance hypothesised to
explain galaxy dynamics and other astrophysical phenomena that is thought to
dominate the matter density of the universe. At the current sensitivity level,
we find no evidence for dark matter in the form of topological defects (or,
more generally, any macroscopic objects), and we thus place constraints on
certain potential couplings between the dark matter and standard model
particles, substantially improving upon the existing constraints, particularly
for large (>~10^4 km) objects.

  Information Theory",,,,"cs.DC cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study distributed optimization in the presence of Byzantine adversaries,
where both data and computation are distributed among $m$ worker machines, $t$
of which may be corrupt. The compromised nodes may collaboratively and
arbitrarily deviate from their pre-specified programs, and a designated
(master) node iteratively computes the model/parameter vector for generalized
linear models. In this work, we primarily focus on two iterative algorithms:
Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) and Coordinate Descent (CD). Gradient descent
(GD) is a special case of these algorithms. PGD is typically used in the
data-parallel setting, where data is partitioned across different samples,
whereas, CD is used in the model-parallelism setting, where data is partitioned
across the parameter space.
  In this paper, we propose a method based on data encoding and error
correction over real numbers to combat adversarial attacks. We can tolerate up
to $t\leq \lfloor\frac{m-1}{2}\rfloor$ corrupt worker nodes, which is
information-theoretically optimal. We give deterministic guarantees, and our
method does not assume any probability distribution on the data. We develop a
{\em sparse} encoding scheme which enables computationally efficient data
encoding and decoding. We demonstrate a trade-off between the corruption
threshold and the resource requirements (storage, computational, and
communication complexity). As an example, for $t\leq\frac{m}{3}$, our scheme
incurs only a {\em constant} overhead on these resources, over that required by
the plain distributed PGD/CD algorithms which provide no adversarial
protection. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that makes CD
secure against adversarial attacks.
  Our encoding scheme extends efficiently to the data streaming model and for
stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We also give experimental results to show
the efficacy of our proposed schemes.

becomes a nuclear frequency comb structure. We introduce spectral shaping and
dynamical splitting to the frequency comb structure respectively to optimize
the use of a medium and to break the theoretical maximum of echo efficiency,
i.e., 54\%. Spectral shaping scheme leads to the reduction of required sample
resonant thickness for achieving high echo efficiency of especially a broadband
input. Dynamical splitting method significantly advances the echo efficiency up

that using only few targets is enough to obtain good echo performance, which

potential applications, undergoing a prominent insulator-metal transition (IMT)
near room temperature. The transition mechanism remains highly debated, and
little is known about the IMT at nanoscale dimensions. To shed light on this
problem, here we use ~1 nm wide carbon nanotube (CNT) heaters to trigger the
IMT in VO2. Single metallic CNTs switch the adjacent VO2 at less than half the
voltage and power required by control devices without a CNT, with switching
power as low as ~85 ${\mu}W$ at 300 nm device lengths. We also obtain potential
and temperature maps of devices during operation using Kelvin Probe Microscopy
(KPM) and Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). Comparing these with
three-dimensional electrothermal simulations, we find that the local heating of
the VO2 by the CNT play a key role in the IMT. These results demonstrate the
ability to trigger IMT in VO2 using nanoscale heaters, and highlight the
significance of thermal engineering to improve device behaviour.

radio-quiet NLS1s (RQ-NLS1s) and radio-quiet broad line Seyfert 1 galaxies

For RQ-NLS1s and RQ-BLS1s we found mean log(M_ADBH/M_sun) of 8.00 +/- 0.43 and
7.90 +/- 0.57, respectively. While the derived M_BH values of RQ-BLS1s are
similar to their virial masses, for NLS1s the derived M_ADBH values are about
an order of magnitude larger than their virial estimates. Our analysis thus
indicates that NLS1s have M_BH similar to RQ-BLS1s and their available virial
M_BH values are underestimated influenced by their observed relatively small
emission line widths. Considering Eddington ratio as an estimation of the
accretion rate and using M_ADBH, we found the mean accretion rate of our
RQ-NLS1s, RL-NLS1s and RQ-BLS1s as 0.06 (+0.16, -0.05), 0.05 (+0.18, -0.04) and

The multiphase flow behaviours in hierarchical porous media have remained

found that the immiscible fingering can be suppressed due to the existence of

constitutive parameters of hyperelastic models from a heterogeneous test.
Digital image correlation (DIC) was used to estimate the displacement and
strain fields required by the identification procedure. Two different
hyperelastic models were considered: the Mooney model and the Ogden model.
Applying the VFM to the Mooney model leads to a linear system that involves the
hyperelastic parameters thanks to the linearity of the stress with respect to
these parameters. In the case of the Ogden model, the stress is a nonlinear
function of the hyperelastic parameters and a suitable procedure should be used
to determine virtual fields leading to the best identification. This
complicates the identification and affects its robustness. This is the reason
why the sensitivity-based virtual field approach recently proposed in case of
anisotropic plasticity by Marek et al. (2017) [1] has been successfully
implemented to be applied in case of hyperelasticity. Results obtained clearly
highlight the benefits of such an inverse identification approach in case of
non-linear systems.

industry thanks to its outstanding fatigue resistance. Strain-induced
crystallization (SIC) is found to play a role of paramount importance in the
great crack growth resistance of NR [1]. Typically, NR exhibits a lifetime
reinforcement for non-relaxing loadings [2-3]. At the microscopic scale,
fatigue striations were observed on the fracture surface of Diabolo samples
tested in fatigue. They are the signature of SIC [2,4,5]. In order to provide
additional information on the role of SIC in the fatigue crack growth
resistance of NR, striations are investigated through post-mortem analysis
after fatigue experiments using loading ranging from-0.25 to 0.25. No striation
was observed in the case of tests performed at 90{\textdegree}C. This confirms
that the formation of striation requires a certain crystallinity level in the
material. At 23{\textdegree}C, two striation regimes were identified: small
striation patches with different orientations (Regime 1) and zones with large
and well-formed striations (Regime 2). Since fatigue striations are observed
for all the loading ratios applied, they are therefore not the signature of the
reinforcement. Nevertheless, increasing the minimum value of the strain
amplified the striation phenomenon and the occurrence of Regime 2.

algorithm has been developed to identify the constitutive parameters of
hyperelastic models, by using FE simulations and full kinematic field
measurements. The full kinematic field is measured at the surface of a
cruciform specimen submitted to equibiaxial tension. The sample is
reconstructed by FE to obtain the numerical kinematic field to be compared with
the experimental one. The constitutive parameters used in the numerical model
are then modified through the optimization process, for the numerical kinematic
field to fit with the experimental one. The cost function is then formulated as
the minimization of the difference between these two kinematic fields. The
optimization algorithm is an adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization
algorithm, based on the PageRank algorithm used by the famous search engine
Google. INTRODUCTION The constitutive parameters of hyperelastic models are
generally identified from three homogeneous tests, basically the uniaxial
tension, the pure shear and the equibiaxial tension. From about 10 years, an
alternative methodology has been developed [1, 2, 3, 4], and consists in
performing only one heterogeneous test as long as the field is sufficiently
heterogeneous. This is tipically the case when a multiaxial loading is applied
to a 3 branch or a 4-branch cruciform specimen, which induces a large number of
mechanical states at the specimen surface. The induced heterogeneity is
generally analysed through the distribution of the biaxiality ratio and the
maximal eigen value of the strain. The Digital Image Correlation (DIC)
technique is generally used to retrieve the different mechanical states
induces, and provides the full kinematic field at the specimen surface, i.e. a
large number of experimental data to be analysed to identify the constitutive
parameters of the behaviour model considered.

identification of hyperelastic parameters from a heterogeneous heat source

analogous to geodesics of Riemannian geometry. One definition of them is as
solutions to a third order differential equation determined by the conformal
structure. There is an alternative description via the tractor calculus. In
this article we give a third description using ideas from holography. A
conformal $n$-manifold $X$ can be seen (formally at least) as the asymptotic
boundary of a Poincar\'e--Einstein $(n+1)$-manifold $M$. We show that any curve
$\gamma$ in $X$ has a uniquely determined extension to a surface
$\Sigma_\gamma$ in $M$, which which we call the \emph{ambient surface of
$\gamma$}. This surface meets the boundary $X$ in right angles along $\gamma$
and is singled out by the requirement that it it be a critical point of
renormalised area. The conformal geometry of $\gamma$ is encoded in the
Riemannian geometry of $\Sigma_\gamma$. In particular, $\gamma$ is a conformal
geodesic precisely when $\Sigma_\gamma$ is asymptotically totally geodesic,
i.e. its second fundamental form vanishes to one order higher than expected.
  We also relate this construction to tractors and the ambient metric
construction of Fefferman and Graham. In the $(n+2)$-dimensional ambient
manifold, the ambient surface is a graph over the bundle of scales. The tractor
calculus then identifies with the usual tensor calculus along this surface.
This gives an alternative compact proof of our holographic characterisation of
conformal geodesics.

a controlled experiment on Weibo (the largest microblogging platform in China).
These software bots can exhibit human-like behavior (e.g., preferring
particular content) and simulate the formation of personal social networks and
news consumption under two well-accepted sociological hypotheses (i.e.,
homophily and triadic closure). We deployed 68 bots to Weibo, and each bot ran
for at least 2 months and followed 100 to 120 accounts. In total, we observed
5,318 users and recorded about 630,000 messages exposed to these bots. Our
results show, even with the same selection behaviors, bots preferring
entertainment content are more likely to form polarized communities with their
peers, in which about 80\% of the information they consume is of the same type,
which is a significant difference for bots preferring sci-tech content. The
result suggests that users preference played a more crucial role in limiting
themselves access to diverse content by compared with the two well-known
drivers (self-selection and pre-selection). Furthermore, our results reveal an
ingenious connection between specific content and its propagating
sub-structures in the same social network. In the Weibo network, entertainment
news favors a unidirectional star-like sub-structure, while sci-tech news
spreads on a bidirectional clustering sub-structure. This connection can
amplify the diversity effect of user preference. The discovery may have
important implications for diffusion dynamics study and recommendation system

constraining the dust properties, disk morphology and embedded magnetic fields.
However, different polarization mechanisms and the diversity of dust grain
shapes and compositions lead to ambiguities in the polarization pattern. The
so-called ""self-scattering"" of thermal, re-emitted radiation in the infrared
and mm/submm is discussed as a major polarization mechanism. If the net flux of
the radiation field is in radial direction, it is commonly assumed that the
polarization pattern produced by scattering in a protoplanetary disk shows
concentric rings for disks seen in face-on orientation. We show that a flip of
$90^\circ$ of the polarization vectors may occur and mimic the typical pattern
of dichroic emission of dust grains aligned by a toroidal magnetic field in
disks seen close to face-on. Furthermore, this effect of polarization reversal
is a fast changing function of wavelength and grain size, and thus a powerful
tool to constrain grain composition and size distribution present in
protoplanetary disks. In addition, the effect may also provide unique
constraints for the disk inclination, especially if the disk is seen close to
face-on.

assumptions on the fluxes are needed to constrain the solution. A common
practise is to model the fluxes using latent Gaussian fields with a mean
structure based on estimated fluxes from combinations of process modelling
(natural fluxes) and statistical bookkeeping (anthropogenic emissions). Here,
we reconstruct global \CO flux fields by modelling fluxes using Gaussian Markov
Random Fields (GMRF), resulting in a flexible and computational beneficial
model with a Mat\'ern-like spatial covariance, and a temporal covariance
defined through an auto-regressive model with seasonal dependence.
  In contrast to previous inversions, the flux is defined on a spatially
continuous domain, and the traditionally discrete flux representation is
replaced by integrated fluxes at the resolution specified by the transport
model. This formulation removes aggregation errors in the flux covariance, due
to the traditional representation of area integrals by fluxes at discrete
points, and provides a model closer resembling real-life space-time continuous
fluxes.

solutions with a time-independent asymptotic value of the dilaton necessarily
have vanishing electric field, and thus reduce to Roberts' solution of the
Einstein-dilaton system. Allowing for additional sources, we then obtain
Vaidya-like families of self-similar solutions supported by charged null

hypersurface one can study gravitational collapse analytically. Capitalizing on
this idea, we compute the critical exponent defining the power-law behavior of
the mass contained within the apparent horizon near the threshold of black hole
formation. For the heterotic dilaton coupling $a=1$ the critical exponent takes
the value $1/2$ typically observed in similar analytic studies, but more
generally it is given by $\gamma=a^2(1+a^2)^{-1}$. The analysis is complemented
by an assessment of the classical energy conditions. Finally, and on a

space and time, in which nodes are pixels and their relations form local
neighborhoods. We claim that the strongest cluster in this pixel-level graph
represents the salient object segmentation. We compute the main cluster using a
novel and fast 3D filtering technique that finds the spectral clustering
solution, namely the principal eigenvector of the graph's adjacency matrix,
without building the matrix explicitly - which would be intractable. Our method
is based on the power iteration for finding the principal eigenvector of a
matrix, which we prove is equivalent to performing a specific set of 3D
convolutions in the space-time feature volume. This allows us to avoid creating
the matrix and have a fast parallel implementation on GPU. We show that our
method is much faster than classical power iteration applied directly on the
adjacency matrix. Different from other works, ours is dedicated to preserving
object consistency in space and time at the level of pixels. For that, it
requires powerful pixel-wise features at the frame level. This makes it
perfectly suitable for incorporating the output of a backbone network or other
methods and fast-improving over their solution without supervision. In
experiments, we obtain consistent improvement, with the same set of
hyper-parameters, over the top state of the art methods on DAVIS-2016 dataset,

Lett. 122, 197702 (2019)]. Using a non-linear response theory for magnons, we
analyze the dc spin current generated by a linearly-polarized electromagnetic
wave (typically, terahertz or gigahertz waves). Considering noncentrosymmetric
two-sublattice magnets as an example, we find a finite dc spin current
conductivity at $T=0$, where no thermally-excited magnons exist; this is in
contrast to the case of the spinon spin current, in which the optical
transition of the Fermi degenerate spinons plays an essential role. We find
that the dc spin-current conductivity is insensitive to the Gilbert damping,
i.e., it may be viewed as a shift current carried by bosonic particles
(magnons). Our estimate shows that an electric-field intensity of
$E\sim10^4-10^6$ V/cm is sufficient for an observable spin current. Our theory
indicates that the linearly-polarized electromagnetic wave generally produces a

depletion in subcritical models, due to the longer duration of collapse.
However, the directly observable quantities - the molecule to hydrogen column
density ratios - are generally too similar for observational data to
discriminate between models. The profiles of N$_2$H$^+$ and HCO$^+$ show
qualitative differences between supercritical and subcritical models on scales
of $0.01 \, {\rm pc}$, which may allow the two cases to be distinguished.
However, this requires knowledge of the hydrogen column density, which is not
directly measureable, and predicted line intensity profiles from radiative
transfer modelling are similar for these molecules. Other commonly observed
species, such as HCN and CH$_3$OH, have line intensity profiles which differ
more strongly between models, and so are more promising as tracers of the
mechanism of cloud collapse.

Dvurecenskij and Vetterlein as so-called quantum structures which serve as an
algebraic axiomatization of the logic of quantum mechanics. A natural question
concerns their connections to substructural logics which are described by means
of residuated lattices or posets. In a previous paper it was shown that an
effect algebra can be organized into a so-called conditionally residuated
structure where the adjointness condition holds only for those elements for
which multiplication and implication are defined. Because this is a very strong
restriction, we try to find another kind of residuation where the terms
occurring in the adjointness condition are everywhere defined though the binary
operation of a given effect algebra is only partial. Moreover, we work with
effect algebras which need not be lattice-ordered and hence the lattice
operations join and meet are replaced by means of upper and lower cones which,
however, are not elements but subsets. Hence, the resulting concept, the
so-called unsharp residuated poset, is equipped with LU-terms which substitute
operations, but are everywhere defined. Although this concept seems rather
complicated at the first glance, we prove that such an unsharp residuated poset
can be conversely organized into an effect algebra or a pseudoeffect algebra
depending on commutativity of the multiplication.

two EeV-energy, upward going events originating from below the horizon. As no
standard model (SM) particles, propagating through the earth at such energy and
exit angles, can give rise to the required survival probability for the
observed events, several beyond standard model (BSM) proposals have come up. We
propose a scenario where a $Z_2$ odd sector is responsible for such anomalous
events. The next to lightest $Z_2$ odd particle or the next to lightest stable
particle (NLSP), created from ultra high energy neutrino interactions with
nucleons, can pass through the earth and then decay into the lightest $Z_2$ odd
particle or the lightest stable particle (LSP) and a tau lepton. The long-lived
nature of the NLSP requires its coupling with the LSP to be very small, keeping
the LSP out of thermal equilibrium in the early universe. The LSP can then be a
non-thermal dark matter while the tau leptons produced from NLSP decay after
passing through the earth can explain the ANITA events. We first show that a
purely non-thermal dark matter scenario can not give rise to the required event
rates while a hybrid scenario where dark matter can have both thermal as a well
non-thermal contribution to its relic abundance, serves the purpose.

model in detail at frequencies well below the fundamental resonance where the

background for microwave diagnostics operating in this frequency range. Here we
present a general framework for estimating the ECE levels of fusion plasmas at
such frequencies using ensemble-averaging of rays traced through many
randomized wall reflections. This enables us to account for the overall vacuum
vessel geometry, self-consistently include cross-polarization, and quantify the
statistical uncertainty on the resulting ECE spectra. Applying this to ITER
conditions, we find simulated ECE levels that increase strongly with frequency
and plasma temperature in the considered range of 55-75 GHz. At frequencies
smaller than 70 GHz, we predict an X-mode ECE level below 100 eV in the ITER
baseline plasma scenario, but with corresponding intensities reaching keV
levels in the hotter hybrid plasma scenario. Benchmarking against the SPECE
raytracing code reveals good agreement under relevant conditions, and the
predicted strength of X-mode to O-mode conversion induced by wall reflections
is consistent with estimates from existing fusion devices. We discuss possible
implications of our findings for ITER microwave diagnostics such as ECE,
reflectometry, and collective Thomson scattering.

addition, we have studied the impact of the $\beta$-intensity distributions

allocation (RA) framework for non-ideal non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
schemes in heterogeneous networks. The imperfection of the underlying NOMA
scheme is due to the receiver sensitivity and interference residue from
non-ideal successive interference cancellation (SIC), which is generally
characterized by a fractional error factor (FEF). Our analytical findings first
show that several factors have a significant impact on the achievable NOMA
gain. Then, we investigate fundamental limits on NOMA cluster size as a
function of FEF levels, cluster bandwidth, and quality of service (QoS) demands
of user equipments (UEs). Thereafter, a clustering algorithm is developed by
taking feasible cluster size and channel gain disparity of UEs into account.
Finally, we develop a distributed alpha-fair RA framework where alpha governs
the trade-off between maximum throughput and proportional fairness objectives.
Based on the derived closed-form optimal power levels, the proposed distributed
solution iteratively updates bandwidths, clusters, and UEs' transmission
powers. Numerical results demonstrate that proposed solutions deliver a higher
spectral and energy efficiency than traditionally adopted basic NOMA cluster
size of two. We also show that an imperfect NOMA cannot always provide better
performance than orthogonal multiple access under certain conditions. Finally,
our numerical investigations reveal that NOMA gain is maximized under
downlink/uplink decoupled (DUDe) UE association.

a 3D kinematic dynamo model and a 2D surface flux transport model that has been
closely calibrated to the real Sun. We demonstrate that the difference is due
to the connectivity of active regions to the toroidal field at the base of the
convection zone, which is not accounted for in the surface-only model.
Initially, we consider the decay of a single active region, firstly in a
simplified Cartesian 2D model and subsequently the full 3D model. By varying
the turbulent diffusivity profile in the convection zone, we find that
increasing the diffusivity - so that active regions are more rapidly
disconnected from the base of the convection zone - improves the evolution of
the surface field. However, if we simulate a full solar cycle, we find that the
dynamo is unable to sustain itself under such an enhanced diffusivity. This
suggests that in order to accurately model the solar cycle, we must find an
alternative way to disconnect emerging active regions, whilst conserving
magnetic flux.

the nature of the coupling between the atmosphere and the surrounding disc. We
examine the formation of gaseous envelopes around massive planetary cores via
three-dimensional inviscid and isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We focus
the changes in the envelope properties as the core mass varies from low

rotational support or turbulent mixing are mostly sensitive to the ratio of the
Bondi radius of the core to its physical size. High-mass cores are fed by
supersonic inflows arriving along the polar axis and shocking on the densest
parts of the envelope, driving turbulence and mass accretion. Gas flows out of
the core's Hill sphere in the equatorial plane, describing a global mass
circulation through the envelope. The shell of shocked gas atop the core
surface delimits regions of slow (inside) and fast (outside) material recycling

  observational data","15 pages, 3 figures",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: In longitudinal data, it is common to create 'change scores' by
subtracting measurements taken at baseline from those taken at follow-up, and
then to analyse the resulting 'change' as the outcome variable. In
observational data, this approach can produce misleading causal effect
estimates. The present article uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and simple
simulations to provide an accessible explanation of why change scores do not
estimate causal effects in observational data.
  Methods: Data were simulated to match three general scenarios where the
variable representing measurements of the outcome at baseline was a 1)
competing exposure, 2) confounder, or 3) mediator for the total causal effect
of the exposure on the variable representing measurements of the outcome at
follow-up. Regression coefficients were compared between change-score analyses
and DAG-informed analyses.
  Results: Change-score analyses do not provide meaningful causal effect
estimates unless the variable representing measurements of the outcome at
baseline is a competing exposure, as in a randomised experiment. Where such
variables (i.e. baseline measurements of the outcome) are confounders or
mediators, the conclusions drawn from analyses of change scores diverge
(potentially substantially) from those of DAG-informed analyses.
  Conclusions: Future observational studies that seek causal effect estimates
should avoid analysing change scores and adopt alternative analytical
strategies.

order to both achieve the productivity that comes with high-level languages,
and make use of the efficiency of low level kernels, we are developing Linnea,
a code generator for linear algebra problems. As input, Linnea takes a
high-level description of a linear algebra problem and produces as output an
efficient sequence of calls to high-performance kernels. In 25 application
problems, the code generated by Linnea always outperforms Matlab, Julia, Eigen
and Armadillo, with speedups up to and exceeding 10x.

dissipated power, the maximum power under a load, and the maximum extractable

more powerful than the one operating with linear optomechanics. The effect is
explained by the presence of squeezing in the quantum state of the mechanical

Traditional computational methods are limited by imposing a parametric model
for atrophy and are extremely resource-demanding. Recent advances in deep
learning have yielded data-driven models for longitudinal studies (e.g., face
ageing) that are capable of generating synthetic images in real-time. Similar
solutions can be used to model trajectories of atrophy in the brain, although
new challenges need to be addressed to ensure accurate disease progression
modelling. Here we propose Degenerative Adversarial NeuroImage Net (DaniNet)
--- a new deep learning approach that learns to emulate the effect of
neurodegeneration on MRI by simulating atrophy as a function of ages, and
disease progression. DaniNet uses an underlying set of Support Vector

consisting of 2D-MRI slices that are constrained to match regional predictions
from the SVRs. DaniNet is also able to maintain the unique brain morphology of
individuals. Adversarial training ensures realistic brain images and smooth
temporal progression. We train our model using 9652 T1-weighted (longitudinal)

However, deep neural networks often suffer from forgetting previously learned

pseudo samples during learning new concepts and a balanced online memory recall
strategy is to maximally maintain old memories. And we design a comprehensible

interaction regions may deliver large amount of energy into the Earths system,
cause geomagnetic storms, and shape interplanetary space. By statistically
analysing 16 long-living CHs observed by the SDO, we focus on coronal,
morphological and underlying photospheric magnetic field characteristics as
well as investigate the evolution of the associated HSSs. We use CATCH to
extract and analyse CHs using observations taken by AIA and HMI. We derive
changes in the CH properties and correlate them to the CH evolution. Further we
analyse the properties of the HSS signatures near 1au from OMNI data by
manually extracting the peak bulk velocity of the solar wind plasma. We find
that the area evolution of CHs mostly shows a rough trend of growing to a
maximum followed by a decay. No correlation of the area evolution to the
evolution of the signed magnetic flux and signed magnetic flux density enclosed
in the projected CH area was found. From this we conclude that the magnetic
flux within the extracted CH boundaries is not the main cause for its area
evolution. We derive CH area change rates (growth and decay) of 14.2 +/- 15.0 *
10^8 km^2/day showing a reasonable anti-correlation (cc =-0.48) to the solar
activity, approximated by the sunspot number. The change rates of the signed
mean magnetic flux density (27.3 +/- 32.2 mG/day) and the signed magnetic flux
(30.3 +/- 31.5 * 10^18 Mx/day) were also found to be dependent on solar
activity (cc =0.50 and cc =0.69 respectively) rather than on the individual CH
evolutions. Further we find that the CH area-to-HSS peak velocity relation is
valid for each CH over its evolution but revealing significant variations in
the slopes of the regression lines.

into a vector space has become popular for network analysis. Although recent
methods show promising performance for various applications, the huge sizes of
graphs may hinder a direct application of existing network embedding method to
them. This paper presents NECL, a novel efficient Network Embedding method with
two goals. 1) Is there an ideal Compression of a network? 2) Will the
compression of a network significantly boost the representation Learning of the
network? For the first problem, we propose a neighborhood similarity based
graph compression method that compresses the input graph to get a smaller graph
without losing any/much information about the global structure of the graph and
the local proximity of the vertices in the graph. For the second problem, we
use the compressed graph for network embedding instead of the original large
graph to bring down the embedding cost. NECL is a general meta-strategy to
improve the efficiency of all of the state-of-the-art graph embedding
algorithms based on random walks, including DeepWalk and Node2vec, without
losing their effectiveness. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks
validate the efficiency of NECL method that yields an average improvement of 23

this structure, there are three sites for the rare-earth. The magnetization
data reveal that, in addition to a magnetic transition at 64 K, there is
another magnetic feature below 20 K. The C(T) data reveal an upturn below 64 K,
shifting to a lower temperature with increasing field, which establishes that
the onset of magnetic order is of an antiferromagnetic type. However, there is
no worthwhile feature near 20 K in the C(T) curve. AC susceptibility peak
undergoes an observable change with frequency and, in particular, the peak
around 20 K gets suppressed with the application of a dc magnetic field; in
addition, M_IRM undergoes a slow decay with time and isothermal M exhibits
low-field hysteresis below 20 K only, which is typical of spin-glasses. The
results overall suggest that this compound is a reentrant spin-glass in
zero-field. There are experimental signatures pointing to the existence of both
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic components, competing with the variation of
temperature and magnetic field, as a result of which electrical and
magnetoresistance behaviors are peculiar. The results overall suggest this

density imaging (SANDI) using non-invasive diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI). The
existing conjecture in brain microstructure imaging trough DW-MRI presents
water diffusion in white (WM) and grey (GM) matter as restricted diffusion in
neurites, modelled by infinite cylinders of null radius embedded in the
hindered extra-neurite water. The extra-neurite pool in WM corresponds to water
in the extra-axonal space, but in GM it combines water in the extra-cellular
space with water in soma. While several studies showed that this microstructure
model successfully describe DW-MRI data in WM and GM at b<3 ms/{\mum^2}, it has
been also shown to fail in GM at high b values (b>>3 ms/{\mum^2}). Here we
hypothesize that the unmodelled soma compartment may be responsible for this
failure and propose SANDI as a new model of brain microstructure where soma
(i.e. cell body of any brain cell type: from neuroglia to neurons) is
explicitly included. We assess the effects of size and density of soma on the
direction-averaged DW-MRI signal at high b values and the regime of validity of
the model using numerical simulations and comparison with experimental data
from mouse (bmax = 40 ms/{/mum^2}) and human (bmax = 10 ms/{\mum^2}) brain. We
show that SANDI defines new contrasts representing new complementary
information on the brain cyto- and myelo-architecture. Indeed, we show for the
first-time maps from 25 healthy human subjects of MR soma and neurite signal
fractions, that remarkably mirror contrasts of histological images of brain
cyto- and myelo-architecture. Although still under validation, SANDI might

multi-threaded programs with recursive procedure calls, synchronisation by
rendez-vous between parallel threads, and dynamic creation of new threads. To
this end, we consider a model called Synchronized Dynamic Pushdown Networks
(SDPNs) that can be seen as a network of pushdown processes executing
synchronized transitions, spawning new pushdown processes, and performing
internal pushdown actions. The reachability problem for this model is
unfortunately undecidable. Therefore, we tackle this problem by introducing an
abstraction framework based on Kleene algebras in order to compute an
abstraction of the execution paths between two regular sets of configurations.
We combine an automata theoretic saturation procedure with constraint solving
in a finite domain. We then apply this framework to an iterative abstraction
refinement scheme, using multiple abstractions of increasing complexity and
precision.

  possibly ill-posed PDEs, with strong dissipation and any frequency vectors","41 pages including necessary appendix and references",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider several models (including both multidimensional ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs),
possibly ill-posed), subject to very strong damping and quasi-periodic external
forcing. We study the existence of response solutions (i.e., quasi-periodic
solutions with the same frequency as the forcing). Under some regularity
assumptions on the nonlinearity and forcing, without any arithmetic condition
on the forcing frequency $\omega$, we show that the response solutions indeed
exist. Moreover, the solutions we obtained possess optimal regularity in
$\varepsilon$ (where $\varepsilon$ is the inverse of the coefficients
multiplying the damping) when we consider $\varepsilon$ in a domain that does
not include the origin $\varepsilon=0$ but has the origin on its boundary. We
get that the response solutions depend continuously on $\varepsilon$ when we
consider $\varepsilon $ tends to $0$. However, in general, they may not be
differentiable at $\varepsilon=0$. In this paper, we allow multidimensional
systems and we do not require that the unperturbed equations under
consideration are Hamiltonian. One advantage of the method in the present paper
is that it gives results for analytic, finitely differentiable and low
regularity forcing and nonlinearity, respectively. As a matter of fact, we do
not even need that the forcing is continuous. Notably, we obtain results when
the forcing is in $L^2$ space and the nonlinearity is just Lipschitz as well as
in the case that the forcing is in $H^1$ space and the nonlinearity is $C^{1 +
\text{Lip}}$. In the proof of our results, we reformulate the existence of
response solutions as a fixed point problem in appropriate spaces of smooth
functions.

clonal selection still remain unclear. In this paper, we present a
multi-compartmental continuously structured population model of selection
dynamics in acute leukemias, which consists of a system of coupled
integro-differential equations. Our model can be analysed in a more efficient
way than classical models formulated in terms of ordinary differential
equations. Exploiting the analytical tractability of this model, we investigate
how clonal selection is shaped by the self-renewal fraction and the
proliferation rate of leukemic cells at different maturation stages. We
integrate analytical results with numerical solutions of a calibrated version
of the model based on real patient data. In summary, our mathematical results
formalise the biological notion that clonal selection is driven by the
self-renewal fraction of leukemic stem cells and the clones that possess the
highest value of this parameter are ultimately selected. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the self-renewal fraction and the proliferation rate of
non-stem cells do not have a substantial impact on clonal selection. Taken
together, our results indicate that interclonal variability in the self-renewal
fraction of leukemic stem cells provides the necessary substrate for clonal
selection to act upon.

developed an unsupervised random forest method (URerF) to approximately learn
geodesic distances in linear and nonlinear manifolds with noise. URerF operates
on low-dimensional sparse linear combinations of features, rather than the full

results on simulated and real data demonstrate that URerF is robust to

effective potential method was used for the phonon contributions to the figure

anharmonic phonon-phonon, isotope, alloy and grain-boundary scattering. HH

was found to significantly impact $ZT$ and thus the optimal doping level.
Furthermore, the choice of functional was found to significantly affect
thermoelectric properties, particularly for structures exhibiting band
alignment features. The intrinsic thermal conductivity was significantly
reduced when alloy and grain boundary scattering were accounted for, which also
reduced the spread in thermal conductivity. It was found that sub-lattice
disorder on the ${\it Z}$-site, i.e. the site occupied by group 14 or 15
elements, was more effective than ${\it X}$-site substitution, occupied by
group 4 elements. The calculations confirmed that ZrNiSn, ZrCoSb and ZrCoBi
based alloys display promising thermoelectric properties. A few other n-type

twisted bilayer graphene at low twist angles where the graphene Fermi velocity

defect scattering within a Boltzmann theory relaxation time approach. For
experimentally relevant disorder, impurity scattering contributes a resistivity
comparable to (much larger than) the phonon scattering contribution at high
(low) temperatures. Decreasing twist angle leads to larger resistivity, and in
general, the resistivity increases (decreases) with increasing temperature
(carrier density). Inclusion of the van Hove singularity in the theory leads to
a strong increase in the resistivity at higher densities, where the chemical
potential is close to a van Hove singularity, leading to an apparent
density-dependent plateau type structure in the resistivity, which has been
observed in recent transport experiments. We also show that the Matthissen's

trained on simulated data usually do not translate well to real scenarios. To
bridge the domain gap between simulated and real laparoscopic images, we
exploit recent advances in unpaired image-to-image translation. We extent an
image-to-image translation method to generate a diverse multitude of
realistically looking synthetic images based on images from a simple
laparoscopy simulation. By incorporating means to ensure that the image content
is preserved during the translation process, we ensure that the labels given
for the simulated images remain valid for their realistically looking
translations. This way, we are able to generate a large, fully labeled

that this data set can be used to train models for the task of liver
segmentation of laparoscopic images. We achieve average dice scores of up to
0.89 in some patients without manually labeling a single laparoscopic image and
show that using our synthetic data to pre-train models can greatly improve
their performance. The synthetic data set will be made publicly available,

nematicity. The topological order is characterized by fluxes on specific
gauge-invariant quantities and the phase is stable under anisotropic
perturbations relevant for experiments. Finally, we provide dynamical structure
factors of the reported phases that could be observed in inelastic neutron
scattering.

investigation found that registers are often the occupancy limiters.
  The de-facto nvcc compiler-based approach spills excessive registers to the
off-chip memory, ignoring the shared memory and leaving the on-chip resources
underutilized. To mitigate the register demand, this paper presents a binary
translation technique, called RegDem, that spills excessive registers to the
underutilized shared memory by transforming the GPU assembly code (SASS). Most
GPU programs do not fully use shared memory, thus allowing RegDem to use it for
register spilling. The higher occupancy achieved by RegDem outweighs the
slightly higher cost of accessing shared memory instead of placing data in
registers. The paper also presents a compile-time performance predictor that
models instructions stalls to choose the best version from a set of program
variants. Cumulatively, these techniques outperform the nvcc compiler with a 9%

underwater vehicles that use small hydrofoils to make forward progress while
profiling vertically. During each dive, which can last up to 6 hours, the
Seaglider AUG used in this experiment typically reaches the depth of 1000 m and
travels 3-6 km horizontally through the water, relying solely on
dead-reckoning. Horizontal through-the-water (TTW) progress of AUG is 20-30
cm/s, which is comparable to the speed of the stronger ocean currents.
Underwater navigation of an AUG in the presence of unknown advection therefore
presents a considerable challenge. We develop two related formulations for
post-processing. Both use ADCP observations, through the water velocity
estimates, and GPS fixes to estimate current profiles. However, while the first
solves an explicit inverse problem for the current profiles only, the second
solves a deconvolution problem that infers both states and current profiles
using a state-space model. Both approaches agree on their estimates of the
ocean current profile through which the AUG was flown using measurements of
current relative to the AUG from the ADCP, and estimates of the AUGs TTW
velocity from a hydrodynamic model. The result is a complete current profile
along the AUGs trajectory, as well as over-the-ground (OTG) velocities for the
AUG that can be used for more accurate subsea positioning. Results are
demonstrated using 1 MHz ADCP data collected from a Seaglider AUG deployed for

over years to decades. Ray Lake, the lava lake at Mount Erebus, Ross Island,
Antarctica, maintains long-term, near steady-state behavior in temperature,
heat flux, gas flux, lake level, and composition. This activity is superposed
by periodic small pulses of gas and hot magma every 5-18 minutes and disrupted
by sporadic Strombolian eruptions. The periodic pulses have been attributed to
a variety of potential processes including unstable bidirectional flow in the
conduit feeding the lake. In contrast to hypotheses invoking a conduit source
for the observed periodicity, we test the hypothesis that the behavior could be
the result of dynamics within the lake itself, independent of periodic influx
from the conduit. We perform numerical simulations of convection in Ray Lake
driven by both constant and periodic inflow of gas-rich magma from the conduit
to identify whether the two cases have different observational signatures at
the surface. Our simulations show dripping diapirs or pulsing plumes leading to
observable surface behavior with periodicities in the range of 5-20 minutes. We
conclude that a convective speed faster than the inflow speed can result in
periodic behavior without requiring periodicity in conduit dynamics. This
finding suggests that the surface behavior of lava lakes might be less
indicative of volcanic conduit processes in persistently outgassing volcanoes
than previously thought, and that dynamics within the lava lake itself may
modify or overprint patterns emerging from the conduit.

efficient probing of large and unsorted data. If designed properly, hash-tables
can enable efficients look ups in a constant number of operations or commonly
referred to as O(1) operations. As data sizes continue to grow and data becomes
less structured (as is common for big-data applications), the need for
efficient and scalable hash table also grows. In this paper we introduce
HashGraph, a new scalable approach for building hash tables that uses concepts
taken from sparse graph representations--hence the name HashGraph. We show two
different variants of HashGraph, a simple algorithm that outlines the method to
create the hash-table and an advanced method that creates the hash table in a
more efficient manner (with an improved memory access pattern). HashGraph shows
a new way to deal with hash-collisions that does not use ""open-addressing"" or
""chaining"", yet has all the benefits of both these approaches. HashGraph
currently works for static inputs, though recent progress with dynamic graph
data structures suggest that HashGraph might be extended to dynamic inputs as
well. We show that HashGraph can deal with a large number of hash-values per
entry without loss of performance as most open-addressing and chaining
approaches have. Further, we show that HashGraph is indifferent to the
load-factor. Lastly, we show a new probing algorithm for the second phase of
value lookups. Given the above, HashGraph is extremely fast and outperforms
several state of the art hash-table implementations. The implementation of
HashGraph in this paper is for NVIDIA GPUs, though HashGraph is not
architecture dependent. Using a NVIDIA GV100 GPU, HashGraph is anywhere from
2X-8X faster than cuDPP, WarpDrive, and cuDF. HashGraph is able to build a
hash-table at a rate of 2.5 billion keys per second and can probe at nearly the

picture of Ice Giant circulation that is complex, perplexing, and altogether
unlike that seen on the Gas Giants. This review seeks to reconcile the various
competing circulation patterns from an observational perspective, accounting
for spatially-resolved measurements of: zonal albedo contrasts and banded
appearances; cloud-tracked zonal winds; temperature and para-H$_2$ measurements
above the condensate clouds; and equator-to-pole contrasts in condensable
volatiles (methane and hydrogen sulphide) in the deeper troposphere. These
observations identify three distinct latitude domains: an equatorial domain of
deep upwelling and upper-tropospheric subsidence, potentially bounded by peaks
in the retrograde zonal jet and analogous to Jovian cyclonic belts; a
mid-latitude transitional domain of upper-tropospheric upwelling, vigorous
cloud activity, analogous to Jovian anticyclonic zones; and a polar domain of
strong subsidence, volatile depletion, and small-scale (and potentially
seasonally-variable) convective activity. Taken together, the multi-wavelength
observations suggest a tiered structure of stacked circulation cells (at least
two in the troposphere and one in the stratosphere), potentially separated in
the vertical by (i) strong molecular weight gradients associated with cloud
condensation, and by (ii) transitions from a thermally-direct circulation
regime at depth to a wave-driven circulation regime at high altitude. The
inferred circulation can be tested in the coming decade by 3D simulations and
by observations from future world-class facilities. [Abridged]

field theory, and (quantum) thermodynamics. Classical acoustics in fluids is
usually regarded and studied as a part of classical mechanics, more precisely
fluid dynamics. This assumes velocities much below the speed of light and
length scales much above the molecular scale. However, like acoustics, all
three modern theories are field theories, whether classical (gravitation) or
quantum (quantum field theory and quantum thermodynamics). This fact opens
possibilities for establishing direct analogies between acoustics and the other
theories, which are in the focus of the work presented here. The analogy with
covariant (as well as quantum) vector theory of electromagnetism is also
addressed, as the most natural link between the analogue scalar theory of
acoustics and the second-order tensor theory of general relativity. All these
allow an analogue unified theory to be defined, in which the fundamentals of
classical acoustics in fluids are expressed using the formalisms of modern

candidate for a quantum theory of gravity compatible with observations. The
rapid technical progress in computing renormalisation group flows for gravity
and gravity-matter systems in the non-perturbative regime has put many
interesting physical questions within reach. In particular, the construction of
the non-perturbative quantum corrections to the propagation of fields on a
fluctuating spacetime allows addressing the effective propagation of matter on
a quantum spacetime or the possible resolution of spacetime singularities based
on first principle computations. In this article, we assemble a technical
toolbox for carrying out investigations on this promising research frontier. As
a specific example we present results for the momentum-dependent two-point
function for a scalar field induced by the quantum fluctuations of the
underlying geometry in a self-consistent way.

impulsive, often drastic radiative increases, in particular at short
wavelengths, bring immediate impacts that motivate solar physics and space
weather research to understand solar flares to the point of being able to
forecast them. As data and algorithms improve dramatically, questions must be
asked concerning how well the forecasting performs; crucially, we must ask how
to rigorously measure performance in order to critically gauge any
improvements. Building upon earlier-developed methodology (Barnes et al, 2016,
Paper I), international representatives of regional warning centers and
research facilities assembled in 2017 at the Institute for Space-Earth
Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Japan to - for the first time -
directly compare the performance of operational solar flare forecasting
methods. Multiple quantitative evaluation metrics are employed, with focus and
discussion on evaluation methodologies given the restrictions of operational
forecasting. Numerous methods performed consistently above the ""no skill""
level, although which method scored top marks is decisively a function of flare
event definition and the metric used; there was no single winner. Following in
this paper series we ask why the performances differ by examining
implementation details (Leka et al. 2019, Paper III), and then we present a
novel analysis method to evaluate temporal patterns of forecasting errors in
(Park et al. 2019, Paper IV). With these works, this team presents a
well-defined and robust methodology for evaluating solar flare forecasting
methods in both research and operational frameworks, and today's performance

has become an increasingly important problem for many different applications
ranging from control of autonomous vehicles and social robots to security and
surveillance. This problem is compounded by the presence of social interactions
between humans and their physical interactions with the scene. While the
existing literature has explored some of these cues, they mainly ignored the
multimodal nature of each human's future trajectory. In this paper, we present
Social-BiGAT, a graph-based generative adversarial network that generates
realistic, multimodal trajectory predictions by better modelling the social
interactions of pedestrians in a scene. Our method is based on a graph
attention network (GAT) that learns reliable feature representations that
encode the social interactions between humans in the scene, and a recurrent
encoder-decoder architecture that is trained adversarially to predict, based on
the features, the humans' paths. We explicitly account for the multimodal
nature of the prediction problem by forming a reversible transformation between
each scene and its latent noise vector, as in Bicycle-GAN. We show that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance comparing it to several
baselines on existing trajectory forecasting benchmarks.

topology of the magnetic field using single-spacecraft data in the solar wind.
The approach merges two established techniques: the Grad-Shafranov (GS)
reconstruction method, which provides a plausible regional two-dimensional
magnetic field surrounding the spacecraft trajectory, and the Partial Variance
of Increments (PVI) technique that identifies coherent magnetic structures,
such as current sheets. When applied to one month of Wind magnetic field data
at 1-minute resolution, we find that the quasi-two-dimensional turbulence
emerges as a sea of magnetic islands and current sheets. Statistical analysis
confirms that current sheets associated with high values of PVI are mostly
located between and within the GS magnetic islands, corresponding to X-points
and internal boundaries. The method shows great promise for visualizing and
analyzing single-spacecraft data from missions such as Parker Solar Probe and
Solar Orbiter, as well as 1 AU Space Weather monitors such as ACE, Wind and

system regardless of the trust of its participants, who may be honest or
malicious. Proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and DAG-based approaches have emerged
as a better alternative than the proof of work (PoW) for consensus. This paper
introduces a new model, so-called \emph{\stakedag}, which aims for PoS
consensus in a DAG-based trustless system. We address a general model of
trustless system in which participants are distinguished by their stake or
trust: users and validators. Users are normal participants with a no assumed
trust and validators are high profile participants with an established trust.
We then propose a new family of stake-based consensus protocols $\mathfrak{S}$,
operating on the DAG as in the Lachesis protocol~\cite{lachesis01}.
Specifically, we propose a stake-based protocol $S_\phi$ that leverages
participants' stake as validating weights to achieve more secure distributed
systems with practical Byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT) in leaderless
asynchronous Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We then present a general model of
staking for asynchronous DAG-based distributed systems.

by resolving negation of the text-hypothesis pair and determining the polarity
of the text-hypothesis pair whether it is Positive, Negative or Neutral. It is
noticed that the absence of negation detection feature gives inaccurate results
when detecting the entailment relation since the negation revers the truth. The
negation words are considered stop words and removed from the text-hypothesis
pair which may lead wrong entailment decision. Another case not solved
previously, it is impossible that the positive text entails negative text and
vice versa. In this paper, in order to classify the text-hypothesis pair
polarity, a sentiment analysis tool is used. We show that analyzing the
polarity of the text-hypothesis pair increases the entailment accuracy. to
evaluate our approach we used a dataset for Arabic textual entailment (ArbTEDS)

models for non-hierarchical data that have multiple membership structures.
Traditional multilevel models involve hierarchical data structures whereby
lower-level units such as students are nested within higher-level units such as
schools and where these higher-level units may in turn be nested within further
groupings or clusters such as school districts, regions, and countries. With
hierarchical data structures, there is an exact nesting of each lower-level
unit in one and only one higher-level unit. For example, each student attends
one school, each school is located within one school district, and so on.
However, social reality is more complicated than this, and so social and
behavioural data often do not follow pure or strict hierarchies. Two types of
non-hierarchical data structures which often appear in practice are
cross-classified and multiple membership structures. In this article, we
describe multiple membership data structures and multiple membership models
which can be used to analyse them.

throughout their whole evolution while type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) spectra
evolve from dominant hydrogen lines at early times to increasingly strong
helium features later on. However, it is currently unclear whether the
progenitors of these supernova (SN) types form a continuum in pre-SN hydrogen
mass or whether they are physically distinct. SN light-curve morphology
directly relates to progenitor and explosion properties such as the amount of
hydrogen in the envelope, the pre-SN radius, the explosion energy and the
synthesized mass of radioactive material. In this work we study the morphology
of the optical-wavelength light curves of hydrogen-rich SNe II and
hydrogen-poor SNe IIb to test whether an observational continuum exists between
the two. Using a sample of 95 SNe (73 SNe II and 22 SNe IIb), we define a range
of key observational parameters and present a comparative analysis between both
types. We find a lack of events that bridge the observed properties of SNe II
and SNe IIb. Light curve parameters such as rise times and post-maximum decline
rates and curvatures clearly separate both SN types and we therefore conclude
that there is no continuum, with the two SN types forming two observationally
distinct families. In the V-band a rise time of 17 days (SNe II lower, SNe IIb
higher), and a magnitude difference between 30 and 40 days post explosion of
0.4 mag (SNe II lower, SNe IIb higher) serve as approximate thresholds to
differentiate both types.

algorithm is an ensemble learning method based on decision tree, named
Falldetection Ensemble Decision Tree (FEDT). The mobile cloud collaboration
system can be divided into three stages: 1) mobile stage: use a light-weighted
threshold method to filter out the activities of daily livings (ADLs), 2)
collaboration stage: transmit data to cloud and meanwhile extract features in
the cloud, 3) cloud stage: deploy the model trained by FEDT to give the final
detection result with the extracted features. Experiments show that the
performance of the proposed FEDT outperforms the others' over 1-3% both on
sensitivity and specificity, and more importantly, the system can provide
reliable fall detection in practical scenario.

However, due to its programming possibilities and the polyvalence of its
architecture, it can prove to be a versatile tool for stimuli presentation in
research experiments. Nevertheless, it also has some limitations and conditions
that need to be taken into account to ensure optimal performance in particular
experimental situations. Such is the case if we want to use it in an
experimental design that includes the acquisition of biometric signals
synchronized with the broadcasting of video and audio in real time. In the
present paper, we analyse how Unity (version 5.5.1f1) reacts in one such
experimental design that requires the execution of audio-visual material. From
the analysis of an experimental procedure in which the video was executed
following the standard software specifications, we have detected the following
problems desynchronization between the emission of the video and the audio;
desynchronization between the temporary counter and the video; a delay in the
execution of the screenshot; and depending on the encoding of the video a bad
fluency in the video playback, which even though it maintains the total
playback time, it causes Unity to freeze frames and proceed to compensate with
little temporary jumps in the video. Finally, having detected all the problems,
a compensation and verification process is designed to be able to work with
audio-visual material in Unity (version 5.5.1f1) in an accurate way. We present
a protocol for checks and compensations that allows solving these problems to
ensure the execution of robust experiments in terms of reliability.
