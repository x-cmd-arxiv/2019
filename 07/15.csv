resolved into four intense gamma-ray bunches, each coincident with a

``downward"" terrestrial gamma-ray flash (TGF), which is analogous to up-going
TGFs observed from space. Although the scintillation detectors were heavily
saturated by these bunches, the total dose associated with them was
successfully measured by ionization chambers, employed by nine monitoring posts

the present downward TGF is suggested to have taken place at an altitude of

carried out with an emphasis on its relevance to 'bursting', which refers to an
energetic temporal oscillation of the motions (Flores & Jim\'enez, 2010, Phys.

and outer regions, composed of streaks and quasi-streamwise vortical
structures, bear the self-sustaining process remarkably similar to that in the
near-wall region: i.e. the streaks are significantly amplified by the
quasi-streamwise vortices via the lift-up effect; the amplified streaks
subsequently undergo a 'rapid streamwise meandering motion', reminiscent of
streak instability or transient growth, which eventually results in breakdown
of the streaks and regeneration of new quasi-streamwise vortices. Two numerical
experiments, designed to artificially suppress the lift-up effect and the
streak meandering motions, respectively, reveal that these processes are
essential ingredients of the self-sustaining process of the attached eddies in
the logarithmic and outer regions, consistent with several previous theoretical
studies. It is also shown that the artificial suppression of the lift-up effect

substantial amounts of turbulent skin-friction reduction.

raises questions as to what extent these systems may introduce or exacerbate
disparities in care for historically underrepresented and mistreated groups,
due to biases implicitly embedded in observational data in electronic health
records. To address this problem in the context of clinical risk prediction
models, we develop an augmented counterfactual fairness criteria to extend the
group fairness criteria of equalized odds to an individual level. We do so by
requiring that the same prediction be made for a patient, and a counterfactual
patient resulting from changing a sensitive attribute, if the factual and
counterfactual outcomes do not differ. We investigate the extent to which the
augmented counterfactual fairness criteria may be applied to develop fair
models for prolonged inpatient length of stay and mortality with observational
electronic health records data. As the fairness criteria is ill-defined without
knowledge of the data generating process, we use a variational autoencoder to
perform counterfactual inference in the context of an assumed causal graph.
While our technique provides a means to trade off maintenance of fairness with
reduction in predictive performance in the context of a learned generative
model, further work is needed to assess the generality of this approach.

During collaborative software development, developers often use
branches to add features or fix bugs. When merging changes from two branches,
conflicts may occur if the changes are inconsistent. Developers need to resolve
these conflicts before completing the merge, which is an error-prone and
time-consuming process. Early detection of merge conflicts, which warns
developers about resolving conflicts before they become large and complicated,
is among the ways of dealing with this problem. Existing techniques do this by
continuously pulling and merging all combinations of branches in the background
to notify developers as soon as a conflict occurs, which is a computationally
expensive process. One potential way for reducing this cost is to use a
machine-learning based conflict predictor that filters out the merge scenarios
that are not likely to have conflicts, ie safe merge scenarios. Aims. In this
paper, we assess if conflict prediction is feasible. Method. We design a
classifier for predicting merge conflicts, based on 9 light-weight Git feature
sets. To evaluate our predictor, we perform a large-scale study on 267, 657
merge scenarios from 744 GitHub repositories in seven programming languages.
Results. Our results show that we achieve high f1-scores, varying from 0.95 to
0.97 for different programming languages, when predicting safe merge scenarios.
The f1-score is between 0.57 and 0.68 for the conflicting merge scenarios.
Conclusions. Predicting merge conflicts is feasible in practice, especially in
the context of predicting safe merge scenarios as a pre-filtering step for
speculative merging.

type. We use the combinatorial and geometric structure of the convex hull of
orbits of circle actions on Euclidean space to give geometric proofs of the
homotopy type of metric thickenings of the circle.
  Homotopical connectivity bounds of thickenings of the sphere allow us to
prove that a weighted average of function values of odd maps $S^n \to
\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ on a small diameter set is zero. We prove an additional
generalization of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem for odd maps $S^{2n-1} \to
\mathbb{R}^{2kn+2n-1}$. We prove such results for odd maps from the circle to
any Euclidean space with optimal quantitative bounds. This in turn implies that
any raked homogeneous trigonometric polynomial has a zero on a subset of the
circle of a specific diameter; these results are optimal.

Visual-to-auditory sensory substitution (SS) encompasses a family of cheap,

reasons for the tedious training process: the elongated substituting audio
signal, and the disregard for the compressive characteristics of the human
hearing system. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a novel class of SS
methods, by training deep recurrent autoencoders for image-to-sound conversion.
We successfully trained deep learning models on different datasets to execute
visual-to-auditory stimulus conversion. By constraining the visual space, we
demonstrated the viability of shortened substituting audio signals, while
proposing mechanisms, such as the integration of computational hearing models,
to optimally convey visual features in the substituting stimulus as
perceptually discernible auditory components. We tested our approach in two
separate cases. In the first experiment, the author went blindfolded for 5
days, while performing SS training on hand posture discrimination. The second
experiment assessed the accuracy of reaching movements towards objects on a
table. In both test cases, above-chance-level accuracy was attained after a few
hours of training. Our novel SS architecture broadens the horizon of
rehabilitation methods engineered for the visually impaired. Further
improvements on the proposed model shall yield hastened rehabilitation of the
blind and a wider adaptation of SS devices as a consequence.

demonstrate that the proposed method helps networks converge to local optima

introduce a refinement of Malle's conjecture, if $G$ is a group with a
nontrivial Galois action then we consider the set of crossed homomorphisms in

Wiles on generalized Selmer groups, and additionally gives the asymptotic main
term when restricted to certain local behaviors. As a consequence, whenever the
inverse Galois problem is solved for $G\subset S_n$ over $K$ and $G$ has an
abelian normal subgroup $T\trianglelefteq G$ we prove a nontrivial lower bound
for $N(K,G;X)$ given by a nonzero power of $X$ times a power of $\log X$. For
many groups, including many solvable groups, these are the first known

have dramatic effects on the quality of the resulting query execution plans. A
convenient assumption that is ubiquitous among current cost models is to assume
that attributes are independent with each other. However, it ignores potential
correlations which can have a huge negative impact on the accuracy of the cost
model. In this paper we attempt to relax the attribute value independence
assumption without unreasonably deteriorating the accuracy of the cost model.
We propose a novel approach based on a particular type of Bayesian networks
called Chow-Liu trees to approximate the distribution of attribute values
inside each relation of a database. Our results on the TPC-DS benchmark show
that our method is an order of magnitude more precise than other approaches
whilst remaining reasonably efficient in terms of time and space.

Detection (RED). RED uses an exponentially weighted moving average of the queue
size to make packet-dropping decisions, aiming to control the queue size. One
must study RED with current protocols in order to explore its viability in the
context of increased queueing delays.
  We derive a non-linear time-delayed model for Compound TCP-RED. We derive a
sufficient condition for local stability of this model, and examine the impact
of (i) round-trip time (RTT) of the TCP flows, (ii) queue averaging parameter
and (iii) packet-dropping thresholds. Further, we establish that the system
undergoes a Hopf bifurcation as any of the above parameters is varied. This
suggests the emergence of limit cycles in the queue size, which may lead to
synchronisation of TCP flows and loss of link utilisation. Next, we study a
regime where queue size averaging is not performed, and packet-dropping
decisions are based on instantaneous queue size. In this regime, we derive the
necessary and sufficient condition for local stability. A comparison of the
stability results for Compound TCP-RED in the two regimes--with and without
queue size averaging--reveals that averaging may not be beneficial to system
stability. Packet-level simulations show that the queue size indeed exhibits
limit cycle oscillations as system parameters are varied. We then outline a
simple threshold-based queue policy, that could ensure stable low-latency
operation. We show that the threshold policy outperforms RED in terms of
queueing delay, flow completion time and packet loss. We highlight that the
threshold-based policy could mitigate the issue of increased queueing delays in
the Internet.

immediately. Here we explore the influence of resource-scarcity, body size, and
seasonal uncertainty on the expected foraging behaviors of caching rodents in
the northern Chihuahaun Desert by integrating these elements with a Stochastic
Dynamic Program (SDP) to determine fitness-maximizing foraging strategies. We
demonstrate that resource-limited environments promote dependence on fallback
foods, reducing the likelihood of starvation while increasing future risk
exposure. Our results point to a qualitative difference in the use of fallback
foods and the fitness benefits of caching at the threshold body size of 50 g.
Above this threshold the fitness benefits are greater for consumers with
smaller caches, affirming empirical observations of cache use among rodents in
such dynamic environments. This suggests that larger-bodied consumers with
larger caches may be less sensitive to the future uncertainties in monsoonal
onset predicted by global climate scenarios.

quantum channels, generalizing the related resource theory for states
[arXiv:1010.1030; arXiv:1905.11629]. The key constituents of the channel
resource theory are quantum channel boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum
channels, which can be manipulated for free by means of an arbitrary quantum
superchannel (the most general physical transformation of a quantum channel).
One main question of the resource theory is the approximate channel box
transformation problem, in which the goal is to transform an initial channel
box (or boxes) to a final channel box (or boxes), while allowing for an
asymmetric error in the transformation. The channel resource theory is richer
than its counterpart for states because there is a wider variety of ways in
which this question can be framed, either in the one-shot or $n$-shot regimes,
with the latter having parallel and sequential variants. As in our prior work
[arXiv:1905.11629], we consider two special cases of the general channel box
transformation problem, known as distinguishability distillation and dilution.
For the one-shot case, we find that the optimal values of the various tasks are
equal to the non-smooth or smooth channel min- or max-relative entropies, thus
endowing all of these quantities with operational interpretations. In the
asymptotic sequential setting, we prove that the exact distinguishability cost
is equal to the channel max-relative entropy and the distillable
distinguishability is equal to the amortized channel relative entropy of
[arXiv:1808.01498]. This latter result can also be understood as a solution to
Stein's lemma for quantum channels in the sequential setting. Finally, the
theory simplifies significantly for environment-seizable and classical--quantum
channel boxes.

atmospheric decay of an upgoing $\tau$-lepton produced through a charged
current interaction of a $\nu_\tau$ inside the Earth. However, the relatively
steep arrival angles of these perplexing events create tension with the
standard model (SM) neutrino-nucleon interaction cross section. Deepening the
conundrum, the IceCube neutrino telescope and the Pierre Auger Observatory with
substantially larger exposures to cosmic $\nu_\tau$'s in this energy range have
not observed any events. This lack of observation implies that the messenger
particle (MP) giving rise to ANITA events must produce an air shower event rate
at least a factor of 40 larger than that produced by a flux of $\tau$-neutrinos
to avoid conflicts with the upper limits reported by the IceCube and the Pierre
Auger collaborations. In addition, the sensitivity of ANITA to MP-induced
events must be comparable to or larger than those of IceCube and Auger to avoid
conflict with the non-observation of any signal at these facilities. Beyond SM
interpretations of ANITA events can be classified according to whether the MPs:
(i) live inside the Earth, (ii) originate in neutrino-nucleon collisions inside

the Splay algorithm (Sleator and Tarjan 1985). Our first result is that
inserting keys into an empty binary search tree via splaying in the order of
either $T$'s preorder or $T$'s postorder takes linear time. Our proof uses the
fact that preorders and postorders are pattern-avoiding: i.e. they contain no
subsequences that are order-isomorphic to $(2,3,1)$ and $(3,1,2)$,
respectively. Pattern-avoidance implies certain constraints on the manner in
which items are inserted. We exploit this structure with a simple potential
function that counts inserted nodes lying on access paths to uninserted nodes.
Our methods can likely be extended to permutations that avoid more general
patterns. Second, if $T'$ is any other binary search tree with the same keys as
$T$ and $T$ is weight-balanced (Nievergelt and Reingold 1973), then splaying
$T$'s preorder sequence or $T$'s postorder sequence starting from $T'$ takes
linear time. To prove this, we demonstrate that preorders and postorders of
balanced search trees do not contain many large ""jumps"" in symmetric order, and
exploit this fact by using the dynamic finger theorem (Cole et al. 2000). Both

the time spent optimizing the searches with restructuring operations. Sleator
and Tarjan introduced this notion in 1985, along with an algorithm and a
conjecture. The algorithm, Splay, is an elegant procedure for performing
adjustments that move searched items to the top of the tree. The conjecture,
called dynamic optimality, is that the cost of splaying is always within a
constant factor of the optimal algorithm for performing searches. We lay a
foundation for proving the dynamic optimality conjecture. Central to our method
is approximate monotonicity. Approximately monotone algorithms are those whose
cost does not increase by more than a fixed multiple after removing searches
from the sequence. As we shall see, Splay is dynamically optimal if and only if
it is approximately monotone. This result extends to a weaker form of
approximate monotonicity as well as insertion, deletion, and related
algorithms. We prove that a lower bound on optimal execution cost is
approximately monotone and outline how to adapt this proof from the lower bound
to Splay, and how to overcome the remaining barriers to establishing dynamic
optimality.

(photo-z) performance of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey
(S-PLUS). This survey combines a 7 narrow + 5 broad passband filter system,
with a typical photometric-depth of r$\sim$21 AB. For this exercise, we utilize
the Data Release 1 (DR1), corresponding to 336 deg$^{2}$ from the Stripe-82
region. We rely on the \texttt{BPZ2} code to compute our estimates, using a new
library of SED models, which includes additional templates for quiescent
galaxies. When compared to a spectroscopic redshift control sample of
$\sim$100k galaxies, we find a precision of $\sigma_{z}<$0.8\%, $<$2.0\% or
$<$3.0\% for galaxies with magnitudes r$<$17, $<$19 and $<$21, respectively. A
precision of 0.6\% is attained for galaxies with the highest \texttt{Odds}
values. These estimates have a negligible bias and a fraction of catastrophic
outliers inferior to 1\%. We identify a redshift window (i.e., 0.26$<z<$0.32)
where our estimates double their precision, due to the simultaneous detection
of two emission-lines in two distinct narrow-bands; representing a window
opportunity to conduct statistical studies such as luminosity functions. We
forecast a total of $\sim$2M, $\sim$16M and $\sim$32M galaxies in the S-PLUS
survey with a photo-z precision of $\sigma_{z}<$1.0\%, $<$2.0\% and $<$2.5\%
after observing 8000 $deg^{2}$. We also derive redshift Probability Density
Functions, proving their reliability encoding redshift uncertainties and their
potential recovering the $n(z)$ of galaxies at $z<0.4$, with an unprecedented
precision for a photometric survey in the southern hemisphere.

electronic state has sparsely been seen in bulk materials. Here, we report
spin-valley locking in a bulk Dirac semimetal BaMnSb$_2$. We find valley and
spin are inherently coupled for both valence and conduction bands in this
material. This is revealed by comprehensive studies using first principle
calculations, tight-binding and effective model analyses, angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and quantum transport measurements. Moreover, this
material also exhibits a stacked quantum Hall effect. The spin-valley
degeneracy extracted from the plateau height of quantized Hall resistivity is
close to 2. This result, together with the observed Landau level spin
splitting, further confirms the spin-valley locking picture. In the extreme
quantum limit, we have also observed a two-dimensional chiral metal at the side
surface, which represents a novel topological quantum liquid. These findings
establish BaMnSb$_2$ as a rare platform for exploring coupled spin and valley

organization of the tissue environment at micrometer level with data at

direct compari-son and optimization of methods for in-vivo data with externally
validated histological sections with both 2-D and 3-D histology. Yet, all
existing methods make limiting assumptions of either (1) model-based linkages
between b-values or (2) limited associations with single shell data. We
generalize prior deep learning models that used single shell spherical harmonic
transforms to integrate the re-cently developed simple harmonic oscillator
reconstruction (SHORE) basis. To enable learning on the SHORE manifold, we
present an alternative formulation of the fiber orientation distribution (FOD)
object using the SHORE basis while rep-resenting the observed diffusion
weighted data in the SHORE basis. To ensure consistency of hyper-parameter
optimization for SHORE, we present our Deep SHORE approach to learn on a
data-optimized manifold. Deep SHORE is evalu-ated with eight-fold
cross-validation of a preclinical MRI-histology data with four b-values.
Generalizability of in-vivo human data is evaluated on two separate 3T MRI
scanners. Specificity in terms of angular correlation (ACC) with the
preclinical data improved on single shell: 0.78 relative to 0.73 and 0.73,
multi-shell: 0.80 relative to 0.74 (p < 0.001). In the in-vivo human data, Deep
SHORE was more consistent across scanners with 0.63 relative to other
multi-shell methods 0.39, 0.52 and 0.57 in terms of ACC. In conclusion, Deep
SHORE is a promising method to enable data driven learning with DW-MRI under
conditions with varying b-values, number of diffusion shells, and gradient
directions per shell.

user's recommendation request, relevant candidates need to be retrieved in
realtime for subsequent ranking operations. Considering that the retrieval
operation is conducted over considerable items, it has to be both precise and
scalable so that high-quality candidates can be acquired within tolerable
latency. Unfortunately, conventional methods would trade off precision for high
running efficiency, which leads to inferior retrieval quality. In contrast,
those deep learning-based approaches can be highly accurate in identifying
relevant items; yet, they are unsuitable for candidate retrieval due to their
inherent limitation on scalability.
  In this work, a novel framework is proposed to address the above challenges.
The underlying intuition is to rely on a well-trained ranking model for the
supervision of an efficient retrieval model, such that it will unify the
scalability and precision as a whole. We have implemented our conceptual
framework and made comprehensive evaluation for it, where promising results are
achieved against representative baselines.

within cells is an important process in a number of physiological contexts. The
morphology of the cytoskeletal network, along which active, motor-driven
intracellular transport takes place, plays a critical role in regulating such
transport phases. Here, we use a computational model to address the existence
and sensitivity of dynamic sequestering and how it depends on the parameters
governing the cytoskeletal network geometry, with a focus on filament lengths
and polarization away or toward the periphery. Our model of intracellular
transport solves for the time evolution of a probability distribution of cargo
that is transported by passive diffusion in the bulk cytoplasm and driven by
motors on explicitly rendered, polar cytoskeletal filaments with random
orientations. We show that depending on the lengths and polarizations of
filaments in the network, dynamic sequestering regions can form in different
regions of the cell. Furthermore, we find that, for certain parameters, the
residence time of cargo is non-monotonic with increasing filament length,
indicating an optimal regime for dynamic sequestration that is potentially
tunable via filament length. Our results are consistent with {\it in vivo}
observations and suggest that the ability to tunably control cargo
sequestration via cytoskeletal network regulation could provide a general
mechanism to regulate intracellular transport phases.

energy-efficient robot navigation algorithms is gaining importance. There are
two primary approaches to energy efficient navigation: Offline approaches rely
on a previously built energy map as input to a path planner. Obtaining energy
maps for large environments is challenging. Alternatively, the robot can
navigate in an online fashion and build the map as it navigates. Online
navigation in unknown environments with only local information is still a
challenging research problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach which
addresses both of these challenges. Our approach starts with a segmented aerial
image of the environment. We show that a coarse energy map can be built from
the segmentation. However, the absolute energy value for a specific terrain
type (e.g. grass) can vary across environments. Therefore, rather than using
this energy map directly, we use it to build the covariance function for a
Gaussian Process (GP) based representation of the environment. In the online
phase, energy measurements collected during navigation are used for estimating
energy profiles across the environment using GP regression. Coupled with an
A*-like navigation algorithm, we show in simulations that our approach
outperforms representative baseline approaches. We also present results from
field experiments which demonstrate the practical applicability of our method.

formalisms for the emergence of institutions. Although game theory is normally
used to model interactions individually, larger spaces of games can be helpful
for modeling how interactions change. We introduce a framework for modeling
""institutional evolution,"" how individuals change the games they are placed in.
We contrast this with the more familiar within-game ""behavioral evolution"".
Starting from an initial game, agents trace trajectories through game space by
repeatedly navigating to more preferable games until they converge on attractor
games that are preferred to all others. Agents choose between games on the
basis of their ""institutional preferences,"" which define between-game
comparisons in terms of game-level features such as stability, fairness, and
efficiency. Computing institutional change trajectories over the two-player
space, we find that the attractors of self-interested economic agents
over-represent fairness by 100% relative to baseline, even though those agents
are indifferent to fairness. This seems to occur because fairness, as a game
feature, co-occurs with the self-serving features these agents do prefer. We
thus present institutional evolution as a mechanism for encouraging the
spontaneous emergence of cooperation among inherently selfish agents. We then
extend these findings beyond two players, and to two other types of
evolutionary agent: the relative fitness maximizing agent of evolutionary game
theory (who maximizes inequality), and the relative group fitness maximizing
agent of multi-level/group selection theory (who minimizes inequality). This
work provides a flexible, testable formalism for modeling the interdependencies
of behavioral and institutional evolutionary processes.

As in many models of scalar-field driven Dark Energy, the effective Lagrangian
of the field $\varphi$ contains a potential proportional to $e^{-\varphi/f}$.
This potential is modulated in such a way that, in the absence of other matter
fields, it has a local minimum at a small value of $\varphi$. Fluctuations of
$\varphi$ around this minimum give rise to a gas of dark-matter particles. The
field $\varphi$ is coupled to another scalar field $\chi$ in such a way that
the minimum in the effective potential of $\varphi$ disappears when, after a
continuous phase transition accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking,
$\chi$ develops a non-vanishing expectation value. This triggers slow growth of
a homogeneous component of $\varphi$ accompanied by the emergence of Dark
Energy, a phenomenon analogous to the ""wetting transition"" in statistical
mechanics. Inside regions of the Universe where the pressure is small and the
energy density is large enough to stall expansion, in particular around
galaxies and galaxy clusters, the phase transition in the state of $\chi$ does
not take place, and a gas of cold dark-matter particles persists. The evolution
of $\varphi$ at very early times may tune the rate of baryogenesis.

centres around the world to ensure timely incident response handling. The
increasing amounts of generated traffic data have been used to train machine
learning predictors for traffic, however this is a challenging task due to
inter-dependencies of traffic flow both in time and space. Recently, deep
learning techniques have shown significant prediction improvements over
traditional models, however open questions remain around their applicability,
accuracy and parameter tuning. This paper proposes an advanced deep learning
framework for simultaneously predicting the traffic flow on a large number of
monitoring stations along a highly circulated motorway in Sydney, Australia,
including exit and entry loop count stations, and over varying training and
prediction time horizons. The spatial and temporal features extracted from the
36.34 million data points are used in various deep learning architectures that
exploit their spatial structure (convolutional neuronal networks), their
temporal dynamics (recurrent neuronal networks), or both through a hybrid
spatio-temporal modelling (CNN-LSTM). We show that our deep learning models
consistently outperform traditional methods, and we conduct a comparative
analysis of the optimal time horizon of historical data required to predict
traffic flow at different time points in the future.

decoherence in quantum systems by introducing redundancy. Some strategies can
be used to improve the parameters of these codes. For example, entanglement can
provide a way for quantum error correcting codes to achieve higher rates than
the one obtained via the traditional stabilizer formalism. Such codes are
called entanglement-assisted quantum (QUENTA) codes. In this paper, we use
algebraic geometry codes to construct several families of QUENTA codes via the
Euclidean and the Hermitian construction. Two of the families created have
maximal entanglement and have quantum Singleton defect equal to zero or one.
Comparing the other families with the codes with the respective quantum
Gilbert-Varshamov bound, we show that our codes have a rate that surpasses that
bound. At the end, asymptotically good towers of linear complementary dual
codes are used to obtain asymptotically good families of maximal entanglement
QUENTA codes. Furthermore, a simple comparison with the quantum
Gilbert-Varshamov bound demonstrates that using our construction it is possible
to create an asymptotically family of QUENTA codes that exceeds this bound.

during the approximately 3 Myr-long lifetimes of protoplanetary discs. In the
core accretion scenario, the formation of a solid core of around 10 Earth
masses triggers a phase of rapid gas accretion. Previous 3D grid-based
hydrodynamical simulations found runaway gas accretion rates corresponding to
approximately 10 to 100 Jupiter masses per Myr. Such high accretion rates would
result in all planets with larger-than-10-Earth-mass cores forming Jupiter-like
planets, in clear contrast to the ice giants in the Solar System and the
observed exoplanet population. In this work, we use 3D hydrodynamical
simulations, that include radiative transfer, to model the growth of the
envelope on planets with different masses. We find that gas flows rapidly
through the outer part of the envelope, but this flow does not drive accretion.
Instead, gas accretion is the result of quasi-static contraction of the inner
envelope, which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the mass flow through
the outer atmosphere. For planets smaller than Saturn, we measure moderate gas
accretion rates that are below 1 Jupiter mass per Myr. Higher mass planets,
however, accrete up to 10 times faster and do not reveal a self-driven
mechanism that can halt gas accretion. Therefore, the reason for the final
masses of Saturn and Jupiter remains difficult to understand, unless their
completion coincided with the dissipation of the Solar Nebula.

In September 2017 the largest X-class flare of Solar Cycle 24

attracted much interest because of its unique morphological and evolution
characteristics. Among the parameters examined in the AR was magnetic helicity,
but either only approximately, and/or intermittently. Aims. This work is
interested in studying the evolution of the relative magnetic helicity and of
the two components of its decomposition, the non-potential, and the
volume-threading one, in the time interval around the highest activity of AR
12673. Special emphasis is given on the study of the ratio of the non-potential
to total helicity, that was recently proposed as an indicator of ARs
eruptivity. Methods. For these, we first approximate the coronal magnetic field
of the AR with two different optimization-based extrapolation procedures, and
choose the one that produces the most reliable helicity value at each instant.
Moreover, in one of these methods, we weight the optimization by the
uncertainty estimates derived from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
instrument, for the first time. We then follow an accurate method to compute
all quantities of interest. Results. The first observational determination of
the evolution of the non-potential to total helicity ratio seems to confirm the
quality it has in indicating eruptivity. This ratio increases before the major
flares of AR 12673, and afterwards it relaxes to smaller values. Additionally,
the evolution patterns of the various helicity, and energy budgets of AR 12673
are discussed and compared with other works.

disk, with the UV disk extending up to radius 12 kpc ($>$2R$_{25})$. We
estimated the FUV and NUV disk scale-length as 3.05$\pm$0.27 kpc and
2.66$\pm$0.20 kpc respectively. The scale-length in FUV is 2.3 times larger
than that at 3.6 $\mu$m, and we also find the disk to gradually become flatter
from longer to shorter wavelengths. We performed a statistical source
subtraction to eliminate the background contaminants and identified 261
unresolved UV sources between the radii 5.3 kpc and 10 kpc (1 $\sim$ 2
R$_{25}$). The identified UV sources show an age range between 1 - 300 Myr with
a peak at 25 Myr and a mass range between $10^3 M_{\odot}$ to $10^6 M_{\odot}$,
estimated using starburst99 models. The north-eastern spiral arm is found to be
populated by young low mass sources suggesting that the star formation in this
spiral arm is a recent phenomenon. The UV emission beyond the R$_{25}$ radius
has contribution from these low mass sources and is extended up to $\sim$
2R$_{25}$ radius. We conclude that NGC~300 has an extended UV disk, mainly
populated by young low mass sources. The star formation rate is measured to be
$\sim$0.46 $M_{\odot}/yr$ which is comparable to its near optical twin M33.

uncertainties, as those due to the treatment of convection, semiconvection,
rotation, mass loss, nuclear reaction rates and neutrinos production rates are
discussed in some details. The effects of mass transfer between components of
close-binary systems are also considered. By comparing the theoretical
predictions to a sample of type II supernovae for which the initial mass of the
progenitors and the pre-explosive luminosity are available, we conclude that
stellar rotation may explain a few progenitors which appear brighter than
expected in case of non-rotating models. In the most extreme case, SN2012ec, an
initial rotational velocity up to 300 km s$^{-1}$ is required. Alternatively,
these objects could be mass-loosing components of close binaries. However, most
of the observed progenitors appear fainter than expected. This occurrence seems
to indicate that the Compton and pair neutrino energy-loss rates, as predicted
by the standard electro-weak theory, are not efficient enough and that an
additional negative contribution to the stellar energy balance is required. We
show that axions coupled with parameters accessible to currently planned
experiments, such as IAXO and, possibly, Baby-IAXO and ALPS II, may account for
the missing contribution to the stellar energy-loss.

captured in the wild at a large scale, and a 3D object recognition system may
therefore encounter many objects for which the system has received no training.
Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) approaches can assist such systems in recognizing
previously unseen objects. Applying ZSL to 3D point cloud objects is an
emerging topic in the area of 3D vision, however, a significant problem that
ZSL often suffers from is the so-called hubness problem, which is when a model
is biased to predict only a few particular labels for most of the test
instances. We observe that this hubness problem is even more severe for 3D
recognition than for 2D recognition. One reason for this is that in 2D one can
use pre-trained networks trained on large datasets like ImageNet, which
produces high-quality features. However, in the 3D case there are no such
large-scale, labelled datasets available for pre-training which means that the
extracted 3D features are of poorer quality which, in turn, exacerbates the
hubness problem. In this paper, we therefore propose a loss to specifically
address the hubness problem. Our proposed method is effective for both
Zero-Shot and Generalized Zero-Shot Learning, and we perform extensive
evaluations on the challenging datasets ModelNet40, ModelNet10, McGill and

traveling so fast that they will eventually escape from the Milky Way.
Recently, it has been shown that the popular Hills mechanism, in which a binary
system is disrupted via a close encounter with the supermassive black hole at
the Galactic center, may not be their only ejection mechanism. The analyses of
Gaia data ruled out a Galactic center origin for some of them, and instead
indicated that they are extreme disk runaway stars ejected at velocities
exceeding the predicted limits of classical scenarios (dynamical ejection from
star clusters or binary supernova ejection). We present the discovery of a new
extreme disk runaway star, PG 1610$+$062, which is a slowly pulsating B star
bright enough to be studied in detail. A quantitative analysis of spectra taken
with ESI at the Keck Observatory revealed that PG 1610$+$062 is a late B-type
MS star of 4-5 $M_\odot$ with low projected rotational velocity. Abundances (C,
N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe) were derived differentially with respect
to the normal B star HD 137366 and indicate that PG 1610$+$062 is somewhat
metal rich. A kinematic analysis, based on our spectrophotometric distance
(17.3 kpc) and on proper motions from Gaia's second data release, shows that PG
1610$+$062 was probably ejected from the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm at a
velocity of $550\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$, which is beyond the classical limits.
Accordingly, the star is in the top five of the most extreme MS disk runaway
stars and is only the second among the five for which the chemical composition
is known.

TEmporal structure Learning (INTEL) algorithm to address this problem. Our
INTEL algorithm is developed based on a full consideration of the duality
between online prediction and anomaly detection. We first employ a mixture of
weighted Gaussian process models (WGPs) to cover the expected possible temporal
structures of the data. Then, based on the rich modeling capacity of this WGP
mixture, we develop an efficient technique to instantly learn (capture) the
temporal structure of the data that follows a regime shift. This instant
learning is achieved only by adjusting one hyper-parameter value of the mixture
model. A weighted generalization of the product of experts (POE) model is used
for fusing predictions yielded from multiple GP models. An outlier is declared
once a real observation seriously deviates from the fused prediction. If a
certain number of outliers are consecutively declared, then a change point is
declared. Extensive experiments are performed using a diverse of real datasets.
Results show that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than benchmark
methods for SOP in the presence of outliers and change points.

Ledger Technology (DLT), including blockchain. One of the main topics of
interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy
mechanisms, as for example is the case of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a
cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into
the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this
work we describe different strategies to construct Zero Knowledge Range Proofs
(ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot in 2001; the one proposed
in 2008 by Camenisch et al, and Bulletproofs, proposed in 2017. We also compare
these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since Bulletproofs is the most
efficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms
and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous
schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not
desirable in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain.
In case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be
possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, Bulletproofs can
also be used to construct generic Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), in the sense
that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only
restricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of Proof of Knowledge
(PoK). Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for
DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs
protocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced.

in that feature space. We show that: (1) The usual ESN strategy of randomly
generating input-to-state, as well as state coupling leads to shallow memory
time series representations, corresponding to cross-correlation operator with
fast exponentially decaying coefficients; (2) Imposing symmetry on dynamic
coupling yields a constrained dynamic kernel matching the input time series
with straightforward exponentially decaying motifs or exponentially decaying
motifs of the highest frequency; (3) Simple cycle high-dimensional reservoir
topology specified only through two free parameters can implement deep memory
dynamic kernels with a rich variety of matching motifs. We quantify richness of
feature representations imposed by dynamic kernels and demonstrate that for
dynamic kernel associated with cycle reservoir topology, the kernel richness
undergoes a phase transition close to the edge of stability.

  The field-free energy transfer mechanism shows an abrupt transition between

an infinite set of equivalent manifolds. The field-dressed dynamics is highly

performance advantages for the content-provider or user perspective have only
been speculated. Hence, in this paper we aim to provide initial answers for the
feasibility of the concept of QoS-aware RS, by investigating its impact on real

thematic attributes either using symbols overlaid on top of map features, or
using visual channels of the map features themselves. Participants performed a

granularity for both dimensions: time (all time steps, a subrange of steps, one

networks, recent work has been focusing on analyzing energy cost. Indeed, the
energy cost quantifies how much effort is required to drive the system from one
state to another when it is fully controllable. A fully controllable system
means that the system can be driven by external inputs from any initial state
to any final state in finite time. However, it is prohibitively expensive and
unnecessary to confine that the system is fully controllable when we merely
need to accomplish the so-called target control---controlling a subnet of nodes
chosen from the entire network. Yet, when the system is partially controllable,
the associated energy cost remains elusive. Here we present the minimum energy
cost for controlling an arbitrary subset of nodes of a network. Moreover, we
systematically show the scaling behavior of the precise upper and lower bounds
of the minimum energy in term of the time given to accomplish control. For
controlling a given number of target nodes, we further demonstrate that the
associated energy over different configurations can differ by several orders of
magnitude. When the adjacency matrix of the network is nonsingular, we can
simplify the framework by just considering the induced subgraph spanned by
target nodes instead of the entire network. Importantly, we find that, energy
cost could be saved by orders of magnitude as we only need the partial
controllability of the entire network. Our theoretical results are all
corroborated by numerical calculations, and pave the way for estimating the
energy cost to implement realistic target control in various applications.

conditions. The optimization goal is to minimize the PM's volume while
maintaining a desired machine performance measured by the energy efficiency
over the driving cycle and the machine's maximal torque. The magnetic behavior
of the machine is described by a partial differential equation (PDE) and is
simulated by the finite-element method employing an affine decomposition to
avoid reassembling of the system of equations due to the changing PM geometry.
The Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm is used for the optimization.
Stochastic collocation is applied to compute moments of stochastic quantities.
The robustness of the optimized configurations is validated by a Monte Carlo
sampling. It is found that the uncertainties in driving style and road

we try to harmonize the ""style"" of the pasted region with the background

directly by the neural network. In this work, we start from an empirical
observation: the differences can only be found in the spliced region between
the spliced image and the harmonized result while they share the same semantic
information and the appearance in the non-spliced region. Thus, in order to
learn the feature map in the masked region and the others individually, we
propose a novel attention module named Spatial-Separated Attention Module

inserting the S2AM in the coarser low-level features of the Unet structure in
two different ways. Besides image harmonization, we make a big step for
harmonizing the composite image without the specific mask under previous

large-scale unconstrained optimization problems. Its search direction is the
same as for the steepest descent (Cauchy) method, but its stepsize rule is
different. Owing to this, it converges much faster than the Cauchy method. A
feature of the BB method is that it may generate too long steps, which throw
the iterates too far away from the solution. Moreover, it may not converge,
even when the objective function is strongly convex. In this paper, a
stabilization technique is introduced. It consists in bounding the distance
between each pair of successive iterates, which often allows for decreasing the
number of BB iterations. When the BB method does not converge, our simple
modification of this method makes it convergent. Under suitable assumptions, we
prove its global convergence, despite the fact that no line search is involved,
and only gradient values are used. Since the number of stabilization steps is
proved to be finite, the stabilized version inherits the fast local convergence

online methods that perform interventions to deal with bias but use no explicit

method performance to a single number or a curve only provide limited insights.
Yet, systems used in clinical practice demand thorough validation that such
crude characterizations miss. To this end, we present a framework to evaluate
classification methods based on a number of interpretable concepts that are
crucial for a clinical task. Our approach is inspired by the Turing Test
concept and how to devise a test that adaptively questions a method for its
ability to interpret medical images. To do this, we make use of a Twenty
Questions paradigm whereby we use a probabilistic model to characterize the
method's capacity to grasp task-specific concepts, and we introduce a strategy
to sequentially query the method according to its previous answers. The results
show that the probabilistic model is able to expose both the dataset's and the
method's biases, and can be used to reduced the number of queries needed for
confident performance evaluation.

The line emission is seen over a full velocity range of ~180 km/s arising in a
region of diameter <0.14arcsec (less than a few hundred au) in the maser line
H30a, which is the most intense transition reported here. We resolve the
spatio-kinematic structure of a nearly edge-on disk rotating around a central
mass of ~10Msun (d=1.7 kpc) or ~18Msun (d=3 kpc), assuming Keplerian rotation.
Our data also unveil a fast (~100 km/s) bipolar ejection (a jet?) orthogonal to
the disk. In addition, a slow (<15km/s) wind may be lifting off the disk. Both,
the slow and the fast winds are found to be rotating in a similar manner to the
ionized layers of the disk. This represents the first empirical proof of
rotation in a bipolar wind expanding at high velocity (~100 km/s). (abridged)

standard assumption that the source of continuum radiation is located near

corresponds to the Milne problem consideration for continuum. We shortly
discuss the impossibility of the Milne problem for the resonance radiation. We
assume that the resonant atoms are located in a thin layer of an accretion disc
near the surface. In this case the resonance line emission arises due to
scattering of a continuum on the resonant atoms. In thin layer we can neglect
the multiple scattering of the resonance radiation on the resonant atoms. We
consider the axially symmetric problems, where the Stokes parameter U =0. We
take into account the Doppler effect for the frequencies of the resonance line.
The three types of the resonant atom sources are considered (see Figs.1-3). The
first source is the axially symmetric continuous distribution of the resonant
atoms along the circular orbit. The second spot-like source rotates in the
orbit. The third type presents two spot-like sources located in the orbit
contrary one to another. In the first and third cases the shape of the emitting
resonance line is symmetric, i.e. the right and left wings have the similar
shapes. In the second case the resonance line has asymmetric shape. The shape
of the emerging line depends significantly on the ratio of the rotation
velocity value to the velocity, characterizing the Doppler width. It also
depends on the ratio of the electron number density to the number density of
resonant atoms. The results of the calculations characterize the different
observational effects of H$\alpha$ radiation in the accretion discs and can be
used for estimations of the parameters mentioned above.

computational expense of conventional Monte Carlo techniques, but such methods
have rarely been studied for modelling shallow water flows. Existing stochastic
shallow flow models are not well-balanced and their assessment has been limited
to stochastic flows with smooth probability distributions. This paper addresses
these limitations by formulating a one-dimensional stochastic Galerkin shallow
flow model using a low-order Wiener-Hermite Polynomial Chaos expansion with a
finite volume Godunov-type approach, incorporating the surface gradient method
to guarantee well-balancing. Preservation of a lake-at-rest over uncertain
topography is verified analytically and numerically. The model is also assessed
using flows with discontinuous and highly non-Gaussian probability
distributions. Prescribing constant inflow over uncertain topography, the model
converges on a steady-state flow that is subcritical or transcritical depending
on the topography elevation. Using only four Wiener-Hermite basis functions,
the model produces probability distributions comparable to those from a Monte
Carlo reference simulation with 2000 iterations, while executing about 100
times faster. Accompanying model software and simulation data is openly
available online.

extract dynamical parameters of interest. Inferring those parameters from a

underlying environment motion, in order to make future predictions and to
synthesize effective control policies that use this inductive bias. Online
physical reasoning is therefore a fundamental requirement for robust autonomous
agents. When the dynamics involves multiple modes (due to contacts or
interactions between objects) and sensing must proceed directly from a rich
sensory stream such as video, then traditional methods for system
identification may not be well suited. We propose an approach wherein fast
parameter estimation can be achieved directly from video. We integrate a
physically based dynamics model with a recurrent variational autoencoder, by
introducing an additional loss to enforce desired constraints. The model, which
we call Vid2Param, can be trained entirely in simulation, in an end-to-end
manner with domain randomization, to perform online system identification, and
make probabilistic forward predictions of parameters of interest. This enables
the resulting model to encode parameters such as position, velocity,
restitution, air drag and other physical properties of the system. We
illustrate the utility of this in physical experiments wherein a PR2 robot with
a velocity constrained arm must intercept an unknown bouncing ball with partly
occluded vision, by estimating the physical parameters of this ball directly
from the video trace after the ball is released.

we propose a data augmentation framework using a generative model: multi-hop
federated augmentation with sample compression (MultFAug). A multi-hop protocol
speeds up the end-to-end over-the-air transmission of seed samples by enhancing
the transport capacity. The relaying devices guarantee stronger privacy
preservation as well since the origin of each seed sample is hidden in those

devices compress their data samples. The devices sparsify their data samples
prior to transmissions to reduce the sample size, which impacts the
communication payload. This preprocessing also strengthens the privacy of each
sample, which corresponds to the input perturbation for preserving sample
privacy. The numerical evaluations show that the proposed framework
significantly improves privacy guarantee, transmission delay, and local

of three exotic neutral fermions $N_{i}$ ($i=1,2,3$) with $\rm B-L$ charges

analyzing $1+3$ case in detail. We also show the implication of eV scale
sterile-like neutrino on various observables in neutrino oscillation
experiments and the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay. Another

means of micromagnetic simulations that consider these systems as constituted
by two subsystems coupled in terms of an additional exchange interlacing them.
Both subsystems differ in their respective gyromagnetic ratios and temperature
dependence. Other interactions, as for example anisotropic exchange or
spin-orbit torques, can be accounted for differently within each subsystem
according to the physical structure. Micromagnetic simulations are also
endorsed by means of a collective coordinates model which, in contrast with
some previous approaches to these antiferromagnetically coupled systems, based
on effective parameters, also considers them as formed by two coupled
subsystems with experimentally definite parameters. Both simulations and the
collective model reinforce the angular moment compensation argument as
accountable for the linear increase with current of domain wall velocities in
these alloys at a certain temperature or composition. Importantly, the proposed

we let the NTM learn the context of those transitions. We refer to this

ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) suggest that they are powered by jets or
super-critical outflows presumably launched from the ULX accretion disc. Recent
simulations of these systems have shown that the shocked wind can emit thermal
X-rays with estimated luminosities $\sim 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In this work,
we investigated whether it is possible to detect and spatially resolve the
X-ray emission from these systems using archival Chandra observations of the
ULX Holmberg IX X-1. This source is an ideal target to study for two reasons:
it is surrounded by an optical bubble nebula with a large spatial extent
($\sim$ 400 pc) that can easily be resolved with Chandra. Further, it has a
hard X-ray continuum that is easily distinguishable from the expected soft
thermal emission from the nebula. However, a spectral and photometric analysis
on stacked Chandra observations of the source reveals that there is no strong
evidence for an X-ray bubble associated with it, to a limiting luminosity of
$\sim 2 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The detection of such X-ray nebulae may
be possible with future X-ray missions such as Athena, which would provide
useful constraints on the kinematics of the outflow. Finally, our observations
also emphasise that the nebular emission does not contribute significantly to
the residuals in the X-ray spectrum of the source, which are more likely to be
linked to processes localised to the ULX.

generated by a Monte Carlo simulation: one has a commonly used loss function
calculated by the cross entropy and the other has an additional loss term to
penalize nonuniformity for an unpolarized modulation curve based on the
$H$-test, which is used for periodic signal search in X-ray/$\gamma$-ray
astronomy. The modulation curve calculated by the former model with unpolarized
data has several irregular features, which can be canceled out by unfolding the
angular response or simulating the detector rotation. On the other hand, the
latter model can predict a flat modulation curve with a residual systematic
modulation down to $\lesssim1$%. Both models show almost the same modulation
factors and position accuracy of less than 2 pixel (or 240 $\mu$m) for all four
test energies of 2.7, 4.5, 6.4, and 8.0 keV. In addition, event selection is
performed based on probabilities from the CNN to maximize the polarization
sensitivity considering a trade-off between the modulation factor and signal
acceptance. The developed method with machine learning improves the
polarization sensitivity by 10-20%, compared to that determined with the image
moment method developed previously.

tunneling amplitude we observe hybridization of the MZM with the quantum dot,
which is manifested by a half-integer zero-bias conductance $G_0=e^2/2h$
measured on the metallic contacts. The low-energy feature in the conductance
drops abruptly by crossing the transition line from the topological to the
non-topological superconducting regime. Differently from the in-gap
Yu-Shiba-Rosinov-like bound states, which are strongly affected by the on-site
impurity Coulomb repulsion, we show that the MZM signature in the conductance
is robust and persists even at large values of the interaction. Interestingly,
the topological regime is characterized by a vanishing Fano factor, $F=0$,
induced by the MZM. Combined measurements of the conductance and the shot noise
in the experimental set-up presented in the manuscript allow to detect the
topological properties of the superconducting wire and to distinguish the
low-energy contribution of a MZM from other possible sources of zero-bias
anomaly. Despite being interacting the model is exactly solvable, which allows
to have an exact characterization of the charge transport properties of the

the ZFSM are deflected and converted into bulk waves. When the number of the

approximation with the Andrade model for the solid part of the planet, we
develop a global model including the coupling effects of ocean loading,
self-attraction, and deformation of the solid regions. We derive from this
model analytic solutions for the tidal Love numbers and torque exerted on the
planet. These solutions are used with realistic values of parameters provided
by advanced models of the internal structure and tidal oscillations of solid
bodies to explore the parameter space both analytically and numerically. Our
model allows us to fully characterise the frequency-resonant tidal response of
the planet, and particularly the features of resonances associated with the
oceanic tidal modes (eigenfrequencies, resulting maxima of the tidal torque and
Love numbers) as functions of the planet parameters (mass, radius, Andrade
parameters, ocean depth and Rayleigh drag frequency). Resonances associated
with the oceanic tide decrease the critical eccentricity beyond which
asynchronous rotation states distinct from the usual spin-orbit resonances can
exist. We provide an estimation and scaling laws for this critical
eccentricity, which is found to be lowered by roughly one order of magnitude,
switching from ~0.3 to ~0.06 in typical cases and to ~0.01 in extremal ones.

leverages trusted execution environments (TEEs) to address the impracticality

of the TEE to the narrow set of data producing operations, and thus optimizes
the dominant data consumption actions by not requiring a TEE. Furthermore, we
propose a scalable implementation for A-SKY leveraging micro-services that
preserves strong security guarantees while being able to efficiently manage

symbolic powers of an ideal. Our investigation is focused on the behavior of
the function depth R/I^(t) = dim R - pd I^(t) - 1, where I^(t) denotes the t-th
symbolic power of a homogeneous ideal I in a noetherian polynomial ring R and
pd denotes the projective dimension.
  It has been an open question whether the function depth R/I^(t) is
non-increasing if I is a squarefree monomial ideal. We show that depth R/I^(t)
is almost non-increasing in the sense that depth R/I^(s) \ge depth R/I^(t) for
all s \ge 1 and t \in E(s), where
  E(s) = \cup_{i \ge 1} {t \in N| i(s-1)+1 \le t \le is}
  (which contains all integers t \ge (s-1)^2+1). The range E(s) is the best
possible since we can find squarefree monomial ideals I such that depth R/I^(s)
< depth R/I^(t) for t \not\in E(s), which gives a negative answer to the above
question.
  Another open question asks whether the function depth R/I^(t) is always
constant for t \gg 0. We are able to construct counter-examples to this
question by monomial ideals. On the other hand, we show that if I is a monomial
ideal such that I^(t) is integrally closed for t \gg 0 (e.g. if I is a
squarefree monomial ideal), then depth R/I^(t) is constant for t \gg 0 with
lim_{t \to \infty} depth R/I^(t) = dim R - dim \oplus_{t \ge 0} I^(t)/m I^(t).
  Our last result (which is the main contribution of this paper) shows that for
any positive numerical function \phi(t) which is periodic for t \gg 0, there
exist a polynomial ring R and a homogeneous ideal I such that depth R/I^(t) =
\phi(t) for all t \ge 1. As a consequence, for any non-negative numerical
function \psi(t) which is periodic for t \gg 0, there is a homogeneous ideal I
and a number c such that pd I^(t) = \psi(t) + c for all t \ge 1.

technique that produces optimal low-rank approximations of matrices. It has
diverse applications, including machine learning, data science and signal
processing. However, many common problems involve very large matrices that
cannot fit in the main memory of commodity computers, making it impractical to
use standard SVD algorithms that assume fast random access or large amounts of
space for intermediate calculations. To address this issue, we have implemented
an out-of-core (external memory) randomized SVD solution that is fully scalable
and efficiently parallelizable. This solution factors both dense and sparse
matrices of arbitrarily large size within arbitrarily small memory limits,
efficiently using out-of-core storage as needed. It uses an innovative
technique for partitioning matrices that lends itself to out-of-core and
parallel processing, as well as memory and I/O use planning, automatic load
balancing, performance tuning, and makes possible a number of other practical
enhancements to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, by using persistent
external storage (generally HDDs or SSDs), users can resume interrupted
operations without having to recalculate previously performed steps, solving a
major practical problem in factoring very large matrices.

coherence makes them indispensable to both fundamental research and practical
application. In optomechanical cavities, phonon and photon lasing is
facilitated by the ability of photons and phonons to interact intensively and
excite one another coherently. The lasing linewidths of both phonons and
photons are critical for practical application. However, thus far, these
linewidths have not been explored in detail in cavity optomechanical systems.
This study investigates the underlying dynamics of lasing in optomechanical
cavities and experimentally demonstrates simultaneous photon and phonon lasing
with narrow linewidths in a silicon optomechanical crystal cavity. We find that
the linewidths can be accounted for by two distinct physical mechanisms in two
regimes, namely the normal regime and the reversed regime, where the intrinsic
optical decay rate is either larger or smaller than the intrinsic mechanical
decay rate. In the normal regime, an ultra-narrow spectral linewidth of 5.4 kHz
for phonon lasing at 6.22 GHz can be achieved regardless of the linewidth of
the pump light, while these results are counterintuitively unattainable for
photon lasing in the reversed regime. These results pave the way towards
harnessing the coherence of both photons and phonons in silicon photonic
devices and reshaping their spectra, potentially opening up new technologies in
sensing, metrology, spectroscopy, and signal processing, as well as in
applications requiring sources that offer an ultra-high degree of coherence.

spectral lines, and interpretation methods all agree about a vertical magnetic
field gradient in solar active regions on the order of 3 G/km, when a
horizontal magnetic field gradient of only 0.3 G/km is found. This represents
an inexplicable discrepancy with respect to the divB=0 law. The objective of
this paper is to explain these observations through the law B=\mu_0(H+M) in
magnetized media. Magnetization is due to plasma diamagnetism, which results
from the spiral motion of free electrons or charges about the magnetic field.
Their usual photospheric densities lead to very weak magnetization M, four
orders of magnitude lower than H. It is then assumed that electrons escape from
the solar interior, where their thermal velocity is much higher than the escape
velocity, in spite of the effect of protons. They escape from lower layers in a
quasi-static spreading, and accumulate in the photosphere. By evaluating the
magnetic energy of an elementary atom embedded in the magnetized medium obeying
the macroscopic law B=\mu_0(H+M), it is shown that the Zeeman Hamiltonian is
due to the effect of H. Thus, what is measured is H. The decrease in density
with height is responsible for non-zero divergence of M, which is compensated
for by the divergence of H, in order to ensure divB=0. The behavior of the
observed quantities is recovered. The problem of the divergence of the observed
magnetic field in solar active regions finally reveals evidence of electron
accumulation in the solar photosphere. This is not the case of the heavier
protons, which remain in lower layers. An electric field would thus be present
in the solar interior, but as the total charge remains negligible, no electric
field or effect would result outside the star.

derived under weaker assumptions than those seen in other high-dimensional NVC

the sole target; the acquired information must be protected once it is
generated in the sensing process. Considering a remote sensing scenario where a
local site performs cooperative sensing with a remote site to collect private
information at the remote site, the loss of sensing data inevitably causes
private information to be revealed. Quantum key distribution is known to be a
reliable solution for secure data transmission, however, it fails if an
eavesdropper accesses the sensing data generated at a remote site. In this
study, we demonstrate that by sharing entanglement between local and remote
sites, secure quantum remote sensing can be realized, and the secure level is
characterized by asymmetric Fisher information gain. Concretely, only the local
site can acquire the estimated parameter accurately with Fisher information
approaching 1. In contrast, the accessible Fisher information for an
eavesdropper is nearly zero even if he/she obtains the raw sensing data at the
remote site. This achievement is primarily due to the nonlocal calibration and
steering of the probe state at the remote site. Our results explore one
significant advantage of ``quantumness'' and extend the notion of quantum
metrology to the security realm.

approaches rely on the data from the unit to be monitored only: the baseline is
trained on the early life of the unit. An incremental learning procedure tries
to learn new operating conditions as they arise. Three other approaches take
advantage of data from other similar units within a fleet. In two cases, units
are directly compared to each other with similarity measures, and the data from
similar units are combined in the training set. We propose, in the third case,
a new deep-learning methodology to perform, first, a feature alignment of
different units with an Unsupervised Feature Alignment Network (UFAN). Then,
features of both units are combined in the training set of the fault detection
neural network.
  The approaches are tested on a fleet comprising 112 units, observed over one
year of data. All approaches proposed here are an improvement to the baseline,

polarisation fluctuations. As some models of inflation predict PBHs with a
range of masses, we investigate the impacts of extended mass distributions on
PBH abundance constraints. We model PBH energy injection using a ground-up
approach incorporating species-dependent deposition efficiencies. By allowing
the $\Lambda$CDM parameters to vary simultaneously with the PBH fraction and
mass, we show that exclusion bounds on the PBH fraction of DM $f_\text{PBH}$
are relaxed by up to an order of magnitude, compared to the case of fixed
$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We also give 95% exclusion regions for $f_\text{PBH}$

to many remote sensing problems. However, deep learning techniques for
multi-image super-resolution from multitemporal unregistered imagery have
received little attention so far. This work proposes a novel CNN-based
technique that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to combine
multiple images. This novel framework integrates the spatial registration task
directly inside the CNN, and allows to exploit the representation learning
capabilities of the network to enhance registration accuracy. The entire
super-resolution process relies on a single CNN with three main stages: shared
2D convolutions to extract high-dimensional features from the input images; a
subnetwork proposing registration filters derived from the high-dimensional
feature representations; 3D convolutions for slow fusion of the features from
multiple images. The whole network can be trained end-to-end to recover a
single high resolution image from multiple unregistered low resolution images.
The method presented in this paper is the winner of the PROBA-V
super-resolution challenge issued by the European Space Agency.

order and nontrivial topology can induce fascinating topological quantum
phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, chiral Majorana fermions
and axion electrodynamics. Recently, a great deal of attention has been focused
on the intrinsic magnetic TIs, where disorder effects can be eliminated to a
large extent, which is expected to facilitate the emergence of topological
quantum phenomena. In despite of intensive efforts, experimental evidence of
the topological surface states (SSs) remains elusive. Here, by combining
first-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) experiments, we have revealed that EuSn2As2 is an antiferromagnetic TI
with observation of Dirac SSs consistent with our prediction. We also observe
nearly gapless Dirac SSs in antiferromagnetic TIs MnBi2nTe3n+1 (n = 1 and 2),
which were absent in previous ARPES results. These results provide clear
evidence for nontrivial topology of these intrinsic magnetic TIs. Furthermore,
we find that the topological SSs show no observable changes across the magnetic
transition within the experimental resolution, indicating that the magnetic
order has quite small effect on the topological SSs, which can be attributed to
weak hybridization between the localized magnetic moments, from either 4f or 3d
orbitals, and the topological electronic states. This provides insights for
further research that the correlations between magnetism and topological states
need to be strengthened to induce larger gaps in the topological SSs, which
will facilitate the realization of topological quantum phenomena at higher
temperatures.

a manual entry of the time of observations, the measured field strength and
other notes hand-written on each drawing. The data are preserved in a MySQL

essential task for video surveillance in poorly illuminated or dark
environments. Despite many recent studies on person re-identification in the
visible domain (ReId), there are few studies dealing specifically with VI-ReId.
Besides challenges that are common for both ReId and VI-ReId such as
pose/illumination variations, background clutter and occlusion, VI-ReId has
additional challenges as color information is not available in infrared images.
As a result, the performance of VI-ReId systems is typically lower than that of
ReId systems. In this work, we propose a four-stream framework to improve
VI-ReId performance. We train a separate deep convolutional neural network in
each stream using different representations of input images. We expect that
different and complementary features can be learned from each stream. In our
framework, grayscale and infrared input images are used to train the ResNet in
the first stream. In the second stream, RGB and three-channel infrared images
(created by repeating the infrared channel) are used. In the remaining two
streams, we use local pattern maps as input images. These maps are generated
utilizing local Zernike moments transformation. Local pattern maps are obtained
from grayscale and infrared images in the third stream and from RGB and
three-channel infrared images in the last stream. We improve the performance of
the proposed framework by employing a re-ranking algorithm for post-processing.
Our results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms current
state-of-the-art with a large margin by improving Rank-1/mAP by 29.79%/30.91%
on SYSU-MM01 dataset, and by 9.73%/16.36% on RegDB dataset.

The spin-parity assignments of these states are not yet known. We interpret
these narrow resonances as compact hidden-charm diquark-diquark-antiquark
pentaquarks. Using an effective Hamiltonian, based on constituent quarks and
diquarks, we calculate the pentaquark mass spectrum for the complete $SU (3)_F$
lowest $S$- and $P$-wave multiplets, taking into account dominant spin-spin,
spin-orbit, orbital and tensor interactions. The resulting spectrum is very
rich and we work out the quark flavor compositions, masses, and $J^P$ quantum
numbers of the pentaquarks. However, heavy quark symmetry restricts the
observable states in $\Lambda_b$-baryon, as well as in the decays of the other
weakly-decaying $b$-baryons, $\Xi_b$ and $\Omega_b$. In addition, some of the
pentaquark states are estimated to lie below the $J/\psi p$ threshold in
$\Lambda_b$-decays (and corresponding thresholds in $\Xi_b$- and
$\Omega_b$-decays). They decay via $c \bar c$ annihilation into light hadrons
or a dilepton pair, and are expected to be narrower than the $P_c$-states

measurements. In this paper, using the newest catalog of 182 galaxy clusters

investigate the possible redshift evolution of $\gamma(z)$ through a new

leaves an open question about validity of the empirical relation

the way to explore the hot gas fraction within large radii of galaxy clusters
as well as its possible evolution with redshift, which should be studied

such extraordinary characteristics, particularly a hugely efficient light

This does, however, afford the crystal structure to be non-centrosymmetric and
we herein present crystallographic evidence as to how the symmetry breaking
occurs on a crystallographic, and therefore long-scale, level. While the
molecular cation CH3NH3+ is intrinsically polar, it is heavily disordered and
cannot be the sole reason for ferroelectricity. We show that it, nonetheless,
plays an important role as it distorts the neighboring iodide positions from

compute the stellar atmospheric parameters Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], and of
FGK-type stars by means of the EW method. This code has already been
extensively tested in different spectroscopic studies of FGK-type stars with
several spectrographs and against myriads of Gaia-ESO Survey UVES U580 spectra
of late-type, low-mass stars as one of its thirteen pipelines.
  Aims: We describe the code and test it against a library of well
characterised Gaia benchmark stars. We also release the code to the community
and provide the link for download.
  Methods: We carried out the required EW determination of Fe I and Fe II
spectral lines using the automatic tool TAME. StePar implements a grid of MARCS
model atmospheres and the MOOG radiative transfer code to compute stellar
atmospheric parameters by means of a Downhill Simplex minimisation algorithm.
  Results: We show the results of the benchmark star test and also discuss the
limitations of the EW method, and hence the code. In addition, we found a small
internal scatter for the benchmark stars of 9 +- 32 K in Teff, 0.00 +- 0.07 dex

StePar on double-lined spectroscopic binaries or spectra with R < 30,000, SNR <
20 or vsini >15 km/s as well as stars later than K4 or earlier than F6.

the reduction trend and/or even a reversal trend were found in numerous
provinces, particularly in those with heavy NO2 level, based on satellite
observations. Error analysis on satellite data excluded cloud contamination,
instrument anomalies from the main reasons of this change. Ground-based
measurements show strong positive correlations with satellite observations and
similar patterns of year-to-year changes of NO2 in 2018 and 2019 winter time.

immediate attentions from both scientist community and policy makers to this

stronger in GCs than dynamical formation of CVs. In particular, we found that,
on average, the detectable CV population is predominantly composed of CVs
formed via a typical common envelope phase (> 70 per cent). However,
core-collapsed models tend to have higher fractions of bright CVs than
non-core-collapsed ones, which suggests then that the formation of CVs is
indeed slightly favoured through strong dynamical interactions in
core-collapsed GCs, due to the high stellar densities in their cores.

with both directed and undirected edges, and a set of $k$ terminal pairs. The
goal is to find an orientation of the undirected edges that maximizes the
number of terminal pairs for which there is a path from the source to the sink.
The problem is known to be W[1]-hard when parameterized by k and hard to
approximate up to some constant for FPT algorithms assuming Gap-ETH. On the
other hand, no approximation factor better than $O(k)$ is known.
  We show that $k$-Steiner Orientation is unlikely to admit an approximation
algorithm with any constant factor, even within FPT running time. To obtain
this result, we construct a self-reduction via a hashing-based gap
amplification technique, which turns out useful even outside of the FPT
paradigm. Precisely, we rule out any approximation factor of the form $(\log
k)^{o(1)}$ for FPT algorithms (assuming FPT $\ne$ W[1]) and $(\log n)^{o(1)}$
for~purely polynomial-time algorithms (assuming that the class W[1] does not
admit randomized FPT algorithms). Moreover, we prove $k$-Steiner Orientation to
belong to W[1], which entails W[1]-completeness of $(\log
k)^{o(1)}$-approximation for $k$-Steiner Orientation This provides an example
of a natural approximation task that is complete in a parameterized complexity
class.
  Finally, we apply our technique to the maximization version of directed
multicut - Max $(k,p)$-Directed Multicut - where we are given a directed graph,
$k$ terminals pairs, and a budget $p$. The goal is to maximize the number of
separated terminal pairs by removing $p$ edges. We present a simple proof that
the problem admits no FPT approximation with factor $O(k^{\frac 1 2 -
\epsilon})$ (assuming FPT $\ne$ W[1]) and no polynomial-time approximation with
ratio $O(|E(G)|^{\frac 1 2 - \epsilon})$ (assuming NP $\not\subseteq$ co-RP).

superconductors, the magnetically ordered parent compound may not exist in this
nitride family.

physics of PBH DM structure formation from the one involving WIMP DM. We
construct an analytic model for the small-scale PBH velocities that reproduces
the velocity floor seen in numerical simulations, and investigate how these
motions impact PBH accretion bounds at different redshifts. We find that the
effect is small at the time of recombination, leaving the cosmic microwave
background bounds on PBH abundance unchanged. However, already at $z=20$ the
PBH internal motion significantly reduces their accretion due to the additional
$1/v^6$ suppression, affecting the 21 cm bounds. Today the accretion bounds
arising from dwarf galaxies or smaller PBH substructures are all reduced by the
PBH velocity floor. We also investigate the feasibility for the PBH clusters to
coherently accrete gas leading to a possible enhancement proportional to the
cluster's occupation number but find this effect to be insignificant for PBH
around $10 M_{\odot}$ or lighter. Those results should be reconsidered if the
initial PBH distribution is not Poisson, for example, in the case of large
initial PBH clustering.

The Kepler Object of Interest Network (KOINet) is a multi-site
network of telescopes around the globe organised for follow-up observations of
transiting planet candidate Kepler objects of interest (KOIs) with large
transit timing variations (TTVs). The main goal of KOINet is the completion of
their TTV curves as the Kepler telescope stopped observing the original Kepler
field in 2013.
  Aims. We ensure a comprehensive characterisation of the investigated systems
by analysing Kepler data combined with new ground-based transit data using a
photodynamical model. This method is applied to the Kepler-82 system leading to
its first dynamic analysis.
  Methods. In order to provide a coherent description of all observations
simultaneously, we combine the numerical integration of the gravitational
dynamics of a system over the time span of observations with a transit light
curve model. To explore the model parameter space, this photodynamical model is
coupled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
  Results. The Kepler-82b/c system shows sinusoidal TTVs due to their near 2:1
resonance dynamical interaction. An additional chopping effect in the TTVs of
Kepler-82c hints to a further planet near the 3:2 or 3:1 resonance. We
photodynamically analysed Kepler long- and short-cadence data and three new
transit observations obtained by KOINet between 2014 and 2018. Our result
reveals a non-transiting outer planet with a mass of
$m_f=20.9\pm1.0\;M_\bigoplus$ near the 3:2 resonance to the outermost known
planet, Kepler-82c. Furthermore, we determined the densities of planets b and c
to the significantly more precise values $\rho_b=0.98_{-0.14}^{+0.10}\;\text{g
cm}^{-3}$ and $\rho_c=0.494_{-0.077}^{+0.066}\;\text{g cm}^{-3}$.

and characterize patterns of effort contribution and demand throughout the open
source supply chain and investigate if and how these patterns vary with
developer activity; identify different groups of developers; and predict
developers' company affiliation based on their participation patterns. Method:
1,376,946 issues and pull-requests created for 4433 NPM packages with over
10,000 monthly downloads and full (public) commit activity data of the 272,142
issue creators is obtained and analyzed and dependencies on NPM packages are
identified. Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is used to find the groups among
the users based on their effort contribution and demand patterns, and Random
Forest is used as the predictive modeling technique to identify their company
affiliations. Result: Users contribute and demand effort primarily from
packages that they depend on directly with only a tiny fraction of
contributions and demand going to transitive dependencies. A significant
portion of demand goes into packages outside the users' respective supply
chains (constructed based on publicly visible version control data). Three and
two different groups of users are observed based on the effort demand and
effort contribution patterns respectively. The Random Forest model used for
identifying the company affiliation of the users gives a AUC-ROC value of 0.68.
Conclusion: Our results give new insights into effort demand and supply at
different parts of the supply chain of the NPM ecosystem and its users and
suggests the need to increase visibility further upstream.

stationary, and of known frequency-dependent variance. The variance of the
colored Gaussian noise is used as a whitening filter on the data before
computation of the likelihood function. In practice the noise variance is not

two methods for estimating this whitening filter for ground-based gravitational

first method uses large amounts of data separated from the specific segment we
wish to analyze and computes the power spectral density of the noise through
the mean-median Welch method. The second method uses the same data segment as
the parameter estimation analysis, which potentially includes a gravitational
wave signal, and obtains the whitening filter through a fit of the power
spectrum of the data in terms of a sum of splines and Lorentzians. We compare
these two methods and argue that the latter is more reliable for gravitational

both continuous and drawn from high-dimensional spaces. The payoff function to

shown that for Lipschitz-continuous functions, the optimal regret is
$\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{d_x+d_y+1}{d_x+d_y+2}})$, where $d_x$ and $d_y$ are the

of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in real-world scenarios. Robust MPC (RMPC)
addresses this limitation by optimizing over feedback policies but at the
expense of increased computational complexity. Tube MPC is an approximate
solution strategy in which a robust controller, designed offline, keeps the
system in an invariant tube around a desired nominal trajectory, generated
online. Naturally, this decomposition is suboptimal, especially for systems
with changing objectives or operating conditions. In addition, many tube MPC
approaches are unable to capture state-dependent uncertainty due to the
complexity of calculating invariant tubes, resulting in overly-conservative
approximations. This work presents the Dynamic Tube MPC (DTMPC) framework for
nonlinear systems where both the tube geometry and open-loop trajectory are
optimized simultaneously. By using boundary layer sliding control, the tube
geometry can be expressed as a simple relation between control parameters and
uncertainty bound; enabling the tube geometry dynamics to be added to the
nominal MPC optimization with minimal increase in computational complexity. In
addition, DTMPC is able to leverage state-dependent uncertainty to reduce
conservativeness and improve optimization feasibility. DTMPC is demonstrated to
robustly perform obstacle avoidance and modify the tube geometry in response to
obstacle proximity.

asking only one good question leads to over 170% retrieval performance
improvement in terms of P@1, which clearly demonstrates the potential impact of
the task. We further propose a retrieval framework consisting of three
components: question retrieval, question selection, and document retrieval. In
particular, our question selection model takes into account the original query

Our model significantly outperforms competitive baselines. To foster research

features and click through rate (CTR) can exhibit large shifts over time due to
seasonality, changes to ad campaigns and other factors. The predominant
strategy to keep up with these shifts is to train predictive models
continuously, on fresh data, in order to prevent them from becoming stale.
However, in many ad systems positive labels are only observed after a possibly
long and random delay. These delayed labels pose a challenge to data freshness
in continuous training: fresh data may not have complete label information at
the time they are ingested by the training algorithm. Naive strategies which
consider any data point a negative example until a positive label becomes
available tend to underestimate CTR, resulting in inferior user experience and
suboptimal performance for advertisers. The focus of this paper is to identify
the best combination of loss functions and models that enable large-scale
learning from a continuous stream of data in the presence of delayed labels. In
this work, we compare 5 different loss functions, 3 of them applied to this
problem for the first time. We benchmark their performance in offline settings
on both public and proprietary datasets in conjunction with shallow and deep
model architectures. We also discuss the engineering cost associated with
implementing each loss function in a production environment. Finally, we
carried out online experiments with the top performing methods, in order to
validate their performance in a continuous training scheme. While training on
668 million in-house data points offline, our proposed methods outperform
previous state-of-the-art by 3% relative cross entropy (RCE). During online

APMs instead of using the end-to-end SNR distribution. Particularly, using the
Lamperti's transformation (LT), we propose a tractable approach, which we call
LT-based APM analysis, to identify a relationship between any two given APMs
such that it is irrespective of SNR distribution. Thereby, we introduce some
novel relationships among average channel capacity (ACC), average bit error
rate (ABER) and outage probability/capacity (OP/OC) performances, and
accordingly present how to obtain ACC from ABER performance and how to obtain
OP/OC from ACC performance in fading environments. We demonstrate that the ACC
of any communications system can be evaluated empirically without using

prominent theorems concerning the ordinal sum of triangular norms on the real
unit interval states that a triangular norm is continuous if and only if it is
uniquely representable as an ordinal sum of continuous Archimedean triangular

bounded lattice is not always a triangular norm (even if only one summand is
involved), if one just extends the ordinal sum construction to a bounded
lattice in a na\""{\i}ve way. In the present paper, appropriately dealing with
those elements that are incomparable with the endpoints of the given
subintervals, we propose an alternative definition of ordinal sum of countably
many (finite or countably infinite) triangular norms on subintervals of a

The completeness requirement for the lattice is not needed when considering
finitely many triangular norms. The newly proposed ordinal sum is shown to be
always a triangular norm. Several illustrative examples are given.

by net heat transfer between caloric working bodies and heat transfer fluids.
Here we show that this net transfer can be avoided-resulting in true, balanced
regeneration-if one varies the applied electric field while an electrocaloric
(EC) working body dumps heat on traversing a passive fluid regenerator. Our EC
working body is represented by bulk PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3 (PST) near its first-order
ferroelectric phase transition, where we record directly measured adiabatic
temperature changes of up to 2.2 K. Indirectly measured adiabatic temperature
changes of similar magnitude were identified, unlike normal, from adiabatic
measurements of polarization, at nearby starting temperatures, without assuming
a constant heat capacity. The resulting high-resolution
field-temperature-entropy maps of our material, and a small clamped companion
sample, were used to construct cooling cycles that assume the use of an ideal
passive regenerator in order to span $\leq$20 K. These cooling cycles possess
well defined coefficients of performance that are bounded by well defined
Carnot limits, resulting in large ($>$50%) well defined efficiencies that are
not unduly compromised by a small field hysteresis. Our approach permits the
limiting performance of any caloric material in a passive regenerator to be
established, optimized and compared; provides a recipe for true regeneration in
prototype cooling devices; and could be extended to balance active
regeneration.

  Transport Equations","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1807.01524",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, two flux-only least-squares finite element methods (LSFEM) for
the linear hyperbolic transport problem are developed. The transport equation
often has discontinuous solutions and discontinuous inflow boundary conditions,
but the normal component of the flux across the mesh interfaces is continuous.
In traditional LSFEMs, the continuous finite element space is used to
approximate the solution. This will cause unnecessary error around the
discontinuity and serious overshooting. In arXiv:1807.01524 [math.NA], we
reformulate the equation by introducing a new flux variable to separate the
continuity requirements of the flux and the solution. Realizing that the
Raviart-Thomas mixed element space has enough degrees of freedom to approximate
both the flux and its divergence, we eliminate the solution from the system and
get two flux-only formulations, and develop corresponding LSFEMs. The solution
then is recovered by simple post-processing methods using its relation with the
flux. These two versions of flux-only LSFEMs use less DOFs than the method we
developed in arXiv:1807.01524 [math.NA].
  Similar to the LSFEM developed in arXiv:1807.01524 [math.NA], both flux-only
LSFEMs can handle discontinuous solutions better than the traditional
continuous polynomial approximations. We show the existence, uniqueness, a
priori and a posteriori error estimates of the proposed methods. With adaptive
mesh refinements driven by the least-squares a posteriori error estimators, the
solution can be accurately approximated even when the mesh is not aligned with
discontinuity. The overshooting phenomenon is very mild if a piecewise constant
reconstruction of the solution is used. Extensive numerical tests are done to
show the effectiveness of the methods developed in the paper.

all agents are identical), there are important applications which require an
agent to coordinate its actions without knowing a priori how the other agents
behave. One method to make this problem feasible is to assume that the other
agents draw their latent policy (or type) from a specific set, and that a
domain expert could provide a specification of this set, albeit only a
partially correct one. Algorithms have been proposed by several researchers to
compute posterior beliefs over such policy libraries, which can then be used to
determine optimal actions. In this paper, we provide theoretical guidance on
two central design parameters of this method: Firstly, it is important that the
user choose a posterior which can learn the true distribution of latent types,
as otherwise suboptimal actions may be chosen. We analyse convergence
properties of two existing posterior formulations and propose a new posterior
which can learn correlated distributions. Secondly, since the types are
provided by an expert, they may be inaccurate in the sense that they do not
predict the agents' observed actions. We provide a novel characterisation of
optimality which allows experts to use efficient model checking algorithms to
verify optimality of types.

selection problem consists in determining the amount of capital to be invested
in each asset in order to build the most profitable portfolio. The portfolio
optimization problem is naturally modeled as a mean-risk bi-criteria
optimization problem where the mean rate of return of the portfolio must be
maximized whereas a given risk measure must be minimized. Several mathematical
programming models and techniques have been presented in the literature in
order to efficiently solve the portfolio problem. A relatively recent promising
line of research is to exploit clustering information of an assets network in
order to develop new portfolio optimization paradigms. In this paper we endow
the assets network with a metric based on correlation coefficients between
assets' returns, and show how classical location problems on networks can be
used for clustering assets. In particular, by adding a new criterion to the
portfolio selection problem based on an objective function of a classical
location problem, we are able to measure the effect of clustering on the
selected assets with respect to the non-selected ones. Most papers dealing with
clustering and portfolio selection models solve these problems in two distinct
steps: cluster first and then selection. The innovative contribution of this
paper is that we propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation for
dealing with this problem in a unified phase. The effectiveness of our approach
is validated reporting some preliminary computational experiments on some real

ubiquitous. These programs have their own type of bugs known as concurrency
bugs and among them, data race bugs have been mostly in the focus of
researchers over the past decades. In fact, detecting data races is a very
challenging and important task. There have been several research paths in this
area with many sophisticated tools designed and utilized that focus on
detecting data race at the file level. In this paper, we propose DeepRace, a
novel approach toward detecting data races in the source code. We build a deep
neural network model to find data races instead of creating a data race
detector manually. Our model uses a one-layer convolutional neural network
(CNN) with different window size to find data races method. Then we adopt the
class activation map function with global average pooling to extract the
weights of the last convolutional layer and backpropagate it with the input
source code to extract the line of codes with a data race. Thus, the DeepRace
model can detect the data race bugs on a file and line of code level. In
addition, we noticed that DeepRace successfully detects several buggy lines of
code at different locations of the file. We tested the model with OpenMP and
POSIX source code datasets which consist of more than 5000 and 8000 source code
files respectively. We were able to successfully classify buggy source code
files and achieve accuracies ranging from 81% and 86%. We also measured the
performance of detecting and visualizing the data race at the line of code
levels and our model achieved promising results. We only had a small number of
false positives and false, ranging from 1 to 10. Furthermore, we used the
intersection of union to measure the accuracy of the buggy lines of code, our
model achieved promising results of 66 percent.

high FOV image. The Enhanced Deep Super Resolution Generative Adversarial
Network (EDSRGAN) is trained on the Deep Learning Digital Rock Super Resolution
Dataset, a diverse compilation 12000 of raw and processed uCT images. The
network shows comparable performance of 50% to 70% reduction in relative error
over bicubic interpolation. GAN performance in recovering texture shows
superior visual similarity compared to SRCNN and other methods. Difference maps
indicate that the SRCNN section of the SRGAN network recovers large scale edge
(grain boundaries) features while the GAN network regenerates perceptually
indistinguishable high frequency texture. Network performance is generalised
with augmentation, showing high adaptability to noise and blur. HR images are
fed into the network, generating HR-SR images to extrapolate network
performance to sub-resolution features present in the HR images themselves.
Results show that under-resolution features such as dissolved minerals and thin
fractures are regenerated despite the network operating outside of trained
specifications. Comparison with Scanning Electron Microscope images shows
details are consistent with the underlying geometry of the sample. Recovery of
textures benefits the characterisation of digital rocks with a high proportion
of under-resolution micro-porous features, such as carbonate and coal samples.
Images that are normally constrained by the mineralogy of the rock (coal), by
fast transient imaging (waterflooding), or by the energy of the source

detuning are much stronger than coupling strengths. However, scaling up the

  Hindi-English Code-Switching Data",,,,,"eess.AS cs.CL cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  End-to-end (E2E) systems are fast replacing the conventional systems in the
domain of automatic speech recognition. As the target labels are learned
directly from speech data, the E2E systems need a bigger corpus for effective
training. In the context of code-switching task, the E2E systems face two
challenges: (i) the expansion of the target set due to multiple languages
involved, and (ii) the lack of availability of sufficiently large
domain-specific corpus. Towards addressing those challenges, we propose an
approach for reducing the number of target labels for reliable training of the
E2E systems on limited data. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been
demonstrated on two prominent architectures, namely CTC-based and
attention-based E2E networks. The experimental validations are performed on a
recently created Hindi-English code-switching corpus. For contrast purpose, the
results for the full target set based E2E system and a hybrid DNN-HMM system
are also reported.

  anticipation",,"FUZZ-IEEE, Jun 2019, New Orleans, United States",,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new architecture of incremen-tal fuzzy inference system
(also called Evolving Fuzzy System-EFS). In the context of classifying data
stream in non stationary environment, concept drifts problems must be
addressed. Several studies have shown that EFS can deal with such environment
thanks to their high structural flexibility. These EFS perform well with smooth
drift (or incremental drift). The new architecture we propose is focused on
improving the processing of brutal changes in the data distribution (often
called brutal concept drift). More precisely, a generalized EFS is paired with
a module of anticipation to improve the adaptation of new rules after a brutal
drift. The proposed architecture is evaluated on three datasets from UCI
repository where artificial brutal drifts have been applied. A fit model is
also proposed to get a ""reactivity time"" needed to converge to the steady-state
and the score at end. Both characteristics are compared between the same system
with and without anticipation and with a similar EFS from state-of-the-art. The
experiments demonstrates improvements in both cases.

the black holes, the reflecting star becomes polarized.

experimentally realized embodiment of an electric polarization current whose
rotating distribution pattern moves with linear speeds exceeding the speed of
light in vacuum. I find that the flux density of the resulting emission (i) has
a dominant value and is linearly polarized within a sharply delineated
radiation beam whose orientation and polar width are determined by the range of
values of the linear speeds of the rotating source distribution, and (ii)
decays with the distance $d$ from the source as $d^{-\alpha}$ in which the
value of $\alpha$ lies between $1$ and $2$ (instead of being equal to $2$ as in
a conventional radiation) across the beam. In that the rate at which boundaries
of the retarded distribution of such a source change with time depends on its
duration monotonically, this is an intrinsically transient emission process:
temporal rate of change of the energy density of the radiation generated by it
has a time-averaged value that is negative (instead of being zero as in a
conventional radiation) at points where the envelopes of the wave fronts
emanating from the constituent volume elements of the source distribution are
cusped. The difference in the fluxes of power across any two spheres centred on
the source is in this case balanced by the change with time of the energy
contained inside the shell bounded by those spheres. These results are relevant
not only to long-range transmitters in communications technology but also to
astrophysical objects containing rapidly rotating neutron stars (such as
pulsars) and to the interpretation of the energetics of the multi-wavelength
emissions from sources that lie at cosmological distances (such as radio and
gamma-ray bursts). The analysis presented in this paper is self-contained and
supersedes my earlier works on this problem.

infrastructure for ultra low power Internet of Things devices. Even if the
technology itself is quite mature and specified, the currently deployed
wireless resource allocation strategies are still coarse and based on rough
heuristics. This paper proposes an innovative ""sequential waterfilling""
strategy for assigning Spreading Factors (SF) to End-Devices (ED). Our design
relies on three complementary approaches: i) equalize the Time-on-Air of the
packets transmitted by the system's EDs in each spreading factor's group; ii)
balance the spreading factors across multiple access gateways, and iii) keep
into account the channel capture, which our experimental results show to be
very substantial in LoRa. While retaining an extremely simple and scalable
implementation, this strategy yields a significant improvement (up to 38%) in
the network capacity over the legacy Adaptive Data Rate (ADR), and appears to
be extremely robust to different operating/load conditions and network topology
configurations.

mismatch results in heterogeneous lattice rotation, localised towards the

deformation is induced by the constraint from the CTE between the \b{eta}-Sn,
Cu6Sn5 and Cu at interfaces. The formation of subgrains with continuous
increase in misorientation is revealed during deformation, implying the
accumulation of plastic slip at the strain-localised regions and the activation
of slip systems (1-10)[111]/2 and (11-0)[111]/2.
