equations over $R$, in several variables, with solutions in $R$. We view $HTP$
as an enumeration operator, mapping each set $W$ of prime numbers to
$HTP(\mathbb Z[W^{-1}])$, which is naturally viewed as a set of polynomials in
$\mathbb Z[X_1,X_2,\ldots]$. It is known that for almost all $W$, the jump $W'$
does not $1$-reduce to $HTP(R_W)$. In contrast, we show that every Turing
degree contains a set $W$ for which such a $1$-reduction does hold: these $W$
are said to be ""HTP-complete."" Continuing, we derive additional results
regarding the impossibility that a decision procedure for $W'$ from
$HTP(\mathbb Z[W^{-1}])$ can succeed uniformly on a set of measure $1$, and
regarding the consequences for the boundary sets of the $HTP$ operator in case
$\mathbb Z$ has an existential definition in $\mathbb Q$.

phase separation takes place close to the critical point. Using kinetic Monte

cluster formation governed by thermodynamically undriven Brownian motion is
much more sensitive on the rate of destabilisation than expected from

Lagrangian description of cosmological perturbations which depends on a number

genuine deviations from General Relativity. Such a formalism is thus
particularly convenient to fit and interpret the wealth of new data that will

mag / 100 d and a duration of 90 $\pm$ 5 d. Detailed analysis of SN 2016gfy
provided a mean $\rm^{56}Ni$ mass of 0.033 $\pm$ 0.003 $\rm M_{\odot}$, a
progenitor radius of $\sim$ 350-700 $\rm R_{\odot}$, a progenitor mass of
$\sim$ 12-15 $\rm M_{\odot}$ and an explosion energy of 0.9-1.4$\rm \times
10^{51}\ erg\ s^{-1}$. The P-Cygni profile of H$\rm \alpha$ in the early phase
spectra ($\sim$ 11-21 d) shows a boxy emission. Assuming that this profile
arises from the interaction of the SN ejecta with the pre-existing
circumstellar material (CSM), it is inferred that the progenitor underwent a
recent episode (30-80 years prior to the explosion) of enhanced mass loss.
Numerical modeling suggests that the early LC peak is reproduced better with an
existing CSM of 0.15 $\rm M_{\odot}$ spread out to $\sim$ 70 AU. A late-plateau
bump is seen in the $VRI$ LCs during $\sim$ 50-95 d. This bump is explained as
a result of the CSM interaction and/or partial mixing of radioactive $\rm

abundance is estimated for the supernova H II region (12 + log(O/H) = 8.50
$\pm$ 0.11), indicating an average metallicity for the host of a Type II SN. A
star formation rate of $\sim$ 8.5 $\rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$ is estimated for NGC

light curve evolution is slow ($\sim$0.2 mag 100 d$^{-1}$ in $b$-band). The
spectrum of $\sim$+27 d shows a blue continuum with narrow emission lines,
typical of a Type IIn SN. Archival polarization data along with the $Gaia$ DR2
distances have been utilized to evaluate the interstellar polarization (ISP)
towards the SN direction which is found to be $P_{ISP}$ = 0.17 $\pm$ 0.02 per
cent and $\theta_{ISP}$ = 140$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 3$^{\circ}$. To extract the
intrinsic polarization of SN 2017hcc, both the observed and the literature
polarization measurements were corrected for ISP. We noticed a significant
decline of $\sim$3.5 per cent ($V$-band) in the intrinsic level of polarization
spanning a period of $\sim$2 months. In contrast, the intrinsic polarization
angles remain nearly constant at all epochs. Our study indicates a substantial

suppress the formation of massive structures in the Universe, the halo mass

identified through covariance analysis of the emission directions of kinetic

Next, the dimers are aligned in either one or three dimensions under field-free

angular covariance maps of the tetracene ions are compared to calculated
covariance maps for seven different dimer conformations and found to be

possible conformations down to either a slipped-parallel or

indicate that gravity may be getting weaker at low redshifts $z$. This evidence
is at about $2-3\sigma$ level and comes mainly from weak lensing data that
measure the parameter $S_8=\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{0m}/0.3}$ and redshift space
distortion data that measure the growth rate times the amplitude of the linear
power spectrum parameter $f\sigma_8 (z)$. The measured $f\sigma_8$ appears to
be lower than the prediction of General Relativity (GR) in the context of the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model as defined by the Planck best fit parameter values.
This is the well known $f\sigma_8$ tension of $\Lambda$CDM, which constitutes
one of the two main large scale challenges of the model along with the $H_0$
tension. We review the observational evidence that leads to the $f\sigma_8$
tension and discuss some theoretical implications. If this tension is not a
systematic effect it may be an early hint of modified gravity with an evolving
effective Newton's constant $G_{eff}$ and gravitational slip parameter $\eta$.
We discuss such best fit parametrizations of $G_{eff}(z)$ and point out that
they can not be reproduced by simple scalar-tensor and $f(R)$ modified gravity
theories because these theories generically predict stronger gravity than
General Relativity (GR) at low $z$ in the context of a $\Lambda$CDM background
$H(z)$. Finally, we show weak evidence for an evolving reduced absolute
magnitude of the SnIa of the Pantheon dataset at low redshifts ($z<0.1$) which
may also be explained by a reduced strength of gravity and may help resolve the
$H_0$ tension.

explored in 2D reconnection and 2D and 3D Riemann simulations. The structure of
the exhaust and associated turbulence is controlled by a pair of rotational
discontinuities (RDs) at the exhaust boundary and a pair of slow shocks (SSs)
that are generated by counterstreaming ions beams. In 2D the exhaust develops
large-amplitude striations at the ion Larmor radius scale that are produced by
electron-beam-driven ion cyclotron waves. The electron beams driving the
instability are injected into the exhaust from one of the RDs. However, in 3D
Riemann simulations, the additional dimension (in the out-of-plane direction)
results in strong Buneman and electron-electron streaming instabilities at the
RD which suppress electron beam formation and therefore the striations in the
exhaust. The strength of the streaming instabilities at the RD are controlled
by the ratio of the electron thermal speed to Alfv\'en speed, lower thermal
speed being more unstable. In the 3D simulations an ion-ion streaming
instability acts to partially thermalize the counterstreaming ion beams at the
SSs. This instability is controlled by the ratio of the sound speed to Alfv\'en
speed and is expected to be stable in the low $\beta$ solar corona. The results
suggest that in a guide field reconnection exhaust with $1 \gg \beta >
m_e/m_i$, the kinetic-scale turbulence that develops will be too weak to play a
significant role in energy conversion and particle acceleration. Therefore, the
energy conversion will be mostly controlled by laminar physics or multi-x-line
reconnection.

bigness of distributions on domains of size $n$. We then build on these lower

Our analysis focuses on the measurability of the second spin frequency
derivative $\ddot{\nu}$. This $\ddot{\nu}$ can be induced by several factors
including the radial velocity of a pulsar. We use Bayesian methods to model the
pulsar times-of-arrival in the presence of red timing noise and dispersion
measure variations, modelling the noise processes as power laws. Using
simulated times-of-arrival that both include red noise, dispersion measure
variations and non-zero $\ddot{\nu}$ values, we find that we are able to
recover the injected $\ddot{\nu}$, even when the noise model used to inject and
recover the input parameters are different. Using simulations, we show that the
measurement uncertainty on $\ddot{\nu}$ decreases with the timing baseline $T$
as $T^\gamma$, where $\gamma=-7/2+\alpha/2$ for power law noise models with
shallow power law indices $\alpha$ ($0<\alpha<4$). For steep power law indices
($\alpha>8$), the measurement uncertainty reduces with $T^{-1/2}$. We applied
this method to times-of-arrival from the European Pulsar Timing Array and the
Parkes Pulsar Timing Array and determined $\ddot{\nu}$ probability density
functions for 49 millisecond pulsars. We find a statistically significant
$\ddot{\nu}$ value for PSR\,B1937+21 and consider possible options for its
origin. Significant (95 per cent C.L.) values for $\ddot{\nu}$ are also
measured for PSRs\,J0621+1002 and J1022+1001, thus future studies should
consider including it in their ephemerides. For binary pulsars with small
orbital eccentricities, like PSR\,J1909$-$3744, extended ELL1 models should be
used to overcome computational issues. The impacts of our results on the

properties of distributions over large domains. For many properties, it is
known that the sample complexity can be substantially smaller than the domain
size. For example, over a domain of size $n$, distinguishing the uniform
distribution from distributions that are far from uniform in $\ell_1$-distance
uses only $O(\sqrt{n})$ samples.
  However, the picture is very different in the presence of arbitrary noise,
even when the amount of noise is quite small. In this case, one must
distinguish if samples are coming from a distribution that is $\epsilon$-close
to uniform from the case where the distribution is $(1-\epsilon)$-far from
uniform. The latter task requires nearly linear in $n$ samples [Valiant 2008,
Valian and Valiant 2011].
  In this work, we present a noise model that on one hand is more tractable for
the testing problem, and on the other hand represents a rich class of noise
families. In our model, the noisy distribution is a mixture of the original
distribution and noise, where the latter is known to the tester either
explicitly or via sample access; the form of the noise is also known a priori.
Focusing on the identity and closeness testing problems leads to the following
mixture testing question: Given samples of distributions $p, q_1,q_2$, can we
test if $p$ is a mixture of $q_1$ and $q_2$? We consider this general question
in various scenarios that differ in terms of how the tester can access the
distributions, and show that indeed this problem is more tractable. Our results
show that the sample complexity of our testers are exactly the same as for the

We can use the temporal and textual data of the nodes to compute the edge

beneficial to many applications. Yet, challenges abound. First, the propagation
pattern between each pair of nodes may change by time. Second, not always the
same contagion propagates. Hence, the state-of-the-art text mining approaches
including topic-modeling cannot effectively compute the edge weights. Third,
since the propagation is affected by time, the word-word co-occurrence patterns
may differ in various temporal dimensions, that can decrease the effectiveness
of word embedding approaches. We argue that multi-aspect temporal dimensions
(hour, day, etc) should be considered to better calculate the correlation
weights between the nodes. In this work, we devise a novel framework that on

briefly touch the new topic of near resolvable 2-$(v,2,1)$ designs over

  This study has led us to some (probably new) collateral problems concerning
difference sets. Supported by multiple examples, we conjecture the existence of
infinite families of $\Gamma$-decompositions over a finite field that can be
obtained by suitably labeling the vertices of $\Gamma$ with the elements of a

edge-colored using only $d$ colors, it is NP-hard to recognize graphs of this
type [Holyer, 1981]. So using $d+1$ colors is a natural goal. Efficient
techniques for $(d+1)$-edge-coloring were developed by Gabow, Nishizeki, Kariv,
Leven, and Terada in 1985, and independently by Arjomandi in 1982, leading to
algorithms that run in $O(|E| \sqrt{|V| \log |V|})$ time. They have remained
the fastest known algorithms for this task.
  We improve the runtime to $O(|E| \sqrt{|V|})$ with a small modification and
careful analysis. We then develop a randomized version of the algorithm that is
much simpler to implement and has the same asymptotic runtime, with very high

Underlying these algorithms is a general edge-coloring strategy which may lend
itself to further applications.

from a perfect tree-like structure. The measure has a ""worst-case"" aspect to
it, in the sense that it detects a region in the space which sees the maximum
deviation from tree-like structure. In this article we introduce an
""average-case"" version of Gromov hyperbolicity, which detects whether the ""most
of the space"", with respect to a given probability measure, looks like a tree.
The main result of the paper is that if this average hyperbolicity is small,
then the space can be approximately embedded in a tree. The proof uses a
weighted version of Szemeredi's regularity lemma from graph theory. The result
applies to Gromov hyperbolic spaces as well, since average hyperbolicity is
bounded above by Gromov hyperbolicity. As an application, we give a
construction of hierarchically organized pure states in any model of a spin

across cities through ridge estimation. In doing so, our goal is to explore the
application of density ridges to hot spots and patrol optimization, and to
contribute to the policing literature in police patrolling and crime reduction
strategies.
  Methods: We make use of the subspace-constrained mean shift algorithm, a
recently introduced approach for ridge estimation further developed in
cosmology, which we modify and extend for geospatial datasets and hot spot
analysis. Our experiments extract density ridges of Part I crime incidents from
the City of Chicago during the year 2018 and early 2019 to demonstrate the
application to current data.
  Results: Our results demonstrate nonlinear mode-following ridges in agreement
with broader kernel density estimates. Using early 2019 incidents with
predictive ridges extracted from 2018 data, we create multi-run confidence
intervals and show that our patrol templates cover around 94% of incidents for
0.1-mile envelopes around ridges, quickly rising to near-complete coverage. We
also develop and provide researchers, as well as practitioners, with a
user-friendly and open-source software for fast geospatial density ridge
estimation.
  Conclusions: We show that ridges following crime report densities can be used
to enhance patrolling capabilities. Our empirical tests show the stability of
ridges based on past data, offering an accessible way of identifying routes
within hot spots instead of patrolling epicenters. We suggest further research
into the application and efficacy of density ridges for patrolling.

algorithm consists of an inference step that identifies a region around a point

the iterative optimization procedure for solving CDL, an unsupervised task, is
mapped to an unfolded and constrained neural network, with iterative
adjustments to the inputs to account for the generative distribution. We also
show that the framework can easily be extended for discriminative training,

generative model to learn, in an unsupervised fashion, the latent stimulus that
underlies neural spiking data leads to better goodness-of-fit compared to other
baselines, 2) competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms

depth-variant point spread function (PSF) of a fluorescence microscope produces
low-quality images especially in the out-of-focus regions of thick specimens.
Traditional deconvolution to restore the out-of-focus images is usually
insufficient since a depth-invariant PSF is assumed. This article aims at
handling fluorescence microscopy images by learning-based depth-variant PSF and
reducing artifacts. We propose adaptive weighting depth-variant deconvolution
(AWDVD) with defocus level prediction convolutional neural network (DelpNet) to
restore the out-of-focus images. Depth-variant PSFs of image patches can be
obtained by DelpNet and applied in the afterward deconvolution. AWDVD is
adopted for a whole image which is patch-wise deconvolved and appropriately
cropped before deconvolution. DelpNet achieves the accuracy of 98.2%, which
outperforms the best-ever one using the same microscopy dataset. Image patches
of 11 defocus levels after deconvolution are validated with maximum improvement
in the peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index of 6.6 dB and
11%, respectively. The adaptive weighting of the patch-wise deconvolved image
can eliminate patch boundary artifacts and improve deconvolved image quality.
The proposed method can accurately estimate depth-variant PSF and effectively
recover out-of-focus microscopy images. To our acknowledge, this is the first
study of handling out-of-focus microscopy images using learning-based
depth-variant PSF. Facing one of the most common blurs in fluorescence
microscopy, the novel method provides a practical technology to improve the

mining of representational capacity of deep models, in which all interlayer
skips are implemented by a simple and straightforward operation, i.e., weighted

WCC, the model can achieve the joint attention mechanism of linear and

unknown data based on known data by using a weighted network, many researchers
use the manifold ranking method to solve the document summarization task.
However, their models only consider the original features but ignore the
semantic features of sentences when they construct the weighted networks for
the manifold ranking method. To solve this problem, we proposed two improved
models based on the manifold ranking method. One is combining the topic model
and manifold ranking method (JTMMR) to solve the document summarization task.
This model not only uses the original feature, but also uses the semantic
feature to represent the document, which can improve the accuracy of the
manifold ranking method. The other one is combining the lifelong topic model
and manifold ranking method (JLTMMR). On the basis of the JTMMR, this model
adds the constraint of knowledge to improve the quality of the topic. At the
same time, we also add the constraint of the relationship between documents to
dig out a better document semantic features. The JTMMR model can improve the
effect of the manifold ranking method by using the better semantic feature.
Experiments show that our models can achieve a better result than other
baseline models for multi-document summarization task. At the same time, our
models also have a good performance on the single document summarization task.
After combining with a few basic surface features, our model significantly
outperforms some model based on deep learning in recent years. After that, we
also do an exploring work for lifelong machine learning by analyzing the effect
of adding feedback. Experiments show that the effect of adding feedback to our
model is significant.

prediction framework for two dimensional dynamically changing environments are
introduced. The method is called Time Distance (TD) and benefits from the
space-time space idea. First, the TD concept is defined as the time interval
that must be spent in order for an object to reach another object or a
location. Next, TD functions are derived as a function of location, velocity
and geometry of objects. To construct the configuration-time space, TD
functions in conjunction with another function named ""Z-Infinity"" are
exploited. Finally, an explicit formula for creating the length optimal
collision free path is presented. Length optimization in this formula is
achieved using a function named ""Route Function"" which minimizes a cost
function. Performance of the path planning algorithm is evaluated in
simulations. Comparisons indicate that the algorithm is fast enough and capable
to generate length optimal paths as the most effective methods do. Finally, as
another usage of the TD functions, a collision prediction framework is
presented. This framework consists of an explicit function which is a function
of TD functions and calculates the TD of the vehicle with respect to all
objects of the environment.

severe quality degradation due to light absorption and scattering in water

area of image enhancement and restoration, the applicability of new methods for
improving the quality of underwater images has not specifically been captured.
In this paper, we review the image enhancement and restoration methods that
tackle typical underwater image impairments, including some extreme
degradations and distortions. Firstly, we introduce the key causes of quality
reduction in underwater images, in terms of the underwater image formation
model (IFM). Then, we review underwater restoration methods, considering both
the IFM-free and the IFM-based approaches. Next, we present an
experimental-based comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art IFM-free and

algorithms of the IFM-based methods, using both subjective and objective
analysis (the used code is freely available at

Starting from this study, we pinpoint the key shortcomings of existing methods,

occlusion is still a challenging problem which significantly degenerates the

framework to learn an occlusion-robust model from the full-body person domain
to the occluded person domain. Notably, the teacher network only uses
large-scale full-body person data to simulate the learning process of occluded
person re-id. Based on the teacher network, the student network then trains a
better model by using inadequate real-world occluded person data. In order to
transfer more knowledge from the teacher network to the student network, we
equip the proposed framework with a co-saliency network and a cross-domain
simulator. The co-saliency network extracts the backbone features, and two
separated collaborative branches are followed by the backbone. One branch is a
classification branch for identity recognition and the other is a co-saliency
branch for guiding the network to highlight meaningful parts without any manual
annotation. The cross-domain simulator generates artificial occlusions on
full-body person data under a growing probability so that the teacher network
could train a cross-domain model by observing more and more occluded cases.
Experiments on four occluded person re-id benchmarks show that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Therefore, they are key regions for understanding the system response to

simplified climate system where the planet is entirely covered by the ocean

describing the associated climate feedbacks, by using the principal component
analysis, and by measuring quantities borrowed from the study of dynamical

burn hole at vacuum in the photon number distribution of quantum states of

witnesses of nonclassical properties due to the effect of vacuum state
filtration and a single photon addition on an even coherent state, binomial
state and Kerr state are investigated using the criteria of lower- and
higher-order antibunching, squeezing and sub-Poissonian photon statistics.
Further, the amount of nonclassicality present in these engineered quantum
states is quantified and analyzed by using an entanglement potential based on
linear entropy. It is observed that all the quantum states studied here are
highly nonclassical, and on many occasions the hole burning processes are found
to introduce/enhance nonclassical features. However, it is not true in general.
The investigation has further revealed that despite the fact that a hole at
vacuum implies a maximally nonclassical state (as far as Lee's nonclassical
depth is used as the quantitative measure of nonclassicality). However, any
particular process of hole burning at vacuum does not ensure the existence of a
particular nonclassical feature. Specifically,lower- and higher-order squeezing
are not observed for photon added even coherent state and vacuum filtered even

deontic STIT logics by introducing the multi-agent STIT logic TDS. The logic is
based upon atemporal utilitarian STIT logic. Yet, the logic presented here will
be neutral: instead of committing ourselves to utilitarian theories, we prove
the logic TDS sound and complete with respect to relational frames not
employing any utilitarian function. We demonstrate how these neutral frames can
be transformed into utilitarian temporal frames, while preserving validity.
Last, we discuss problems that arise from employing binary utility functions in
a temporal setting.

A signed graph is an
undirected graph where each edge is given a sign, positive or negative. An
important concept for signed graphs is the operation of switching at a vertex,
which is to change the sign of each incident edge. A homomorphism of a graph is
a vertex-mapping that preserves the adjacencies; in the case of signed graphs,
we also preserve the edge-signs. Special homomorphisms of signed graphs, called
s-homomorphisms, have been studied. In an s-homomorphism, we allow, before the
mapping, to perform any number of switchings on the source signed graph. This
concept has been extensively studied, and a full complexity classification
(polynomial or NP-complete) for s-homomorphism to a fixed target signed graph
has recently been obtained. Such a dichotomy is not known when we restrict the
input graph to be planar (not even for non-signed graph homomorphisms).
  We show that deciding whether a (non-signed) planar graph admits a
homomorphism to the square $C_t^2$ of a cycle with $t\ge 6$, or to the circular
clique $K_{4t/(2t-1)}$ with $t\ge2$, are NP-complete problems. We use these
results to show that deciding whether a planar signed graph admits an
s-homomorphism to an unbalanced even cycle is NP-complete. (A cycle is
unbalanced if it has an odd number of negative edges). We deduce a complete
complexity dichotomy for the planar s-homomorphism problem with any signed
cycle as a target.
  We also study further restrictions involving the maximum degree and the girth
of the input signed graph. We prove that planar s-homomorphism problems to
signed cycles remain NP-complete even for inputs of maximum degree~$3$ (except
for the case of unbalanced $4$-cycles, for which we show this for maximum
degree~$4$). We also show that for a given integer $g$, the problem for signed
bipartite planar inputs of girth $g$ is either trivial or NP-complete.

important in order to reduce the impact of the RPC operation on the

hydrofluoroolefins appear appropriate candidates to replace
C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ thanks to their very low GWPs, especially

the front-end electronics, providing signal amplification, developed for ALICE
operation at high luminosity after the LHC Long Shutdown 2. HFO1234ze-based

radio galaxy NGC 326, which show that the formerly known wings of the radio
lobes extend smoothly into a large-scale, complex radio structure. We argue
that this structure is most likely the result of hydrodynamical effects in an
ongoing group or cluster merger, for which pre-existing X-ray and optical data
provide independent evidence. The large-scale radio structure is hard to
explain purely in terms of jet reorientation due to the merger of binary black
holes, a previously proposed explanation for the inner structure of NGC 326.
For this reason, we suggest that the simplest model is one in which the
merger-related hydrodynamical processes account for all the source structure,
though we do not rule out the possibility that a black hole merger has
occurred. Inference of the black hole-black hole merger rate from observations
of X-shaped sources should be carried out with caution in the absence of deep,
sensitive low-frequency observations. Some X-shaped sources may be signposts of
cluster merger activity, and it would be useful to investigate the environments
of these objects more generally.

onto a lower dimensional hidden space, where the important features get
highlighted and interpretation of the data becomes easier. Recent studies have
shown that even in the presence of noise in the input data, autoencoders can be
trained to reconstruct the noisefree component of the data from the
reduced-dimensional hidden space.
  In this paper, we explore the application of autoencoders within the scope of
denoising geophysical datasets using a data-driven methodology. The autoencoder
formulation is discussed, and a stacked variant of deep autoencoders is
proposed. The proposed method involves locally training the weights first using
basic autoencoders, each comprising a single hidden layer. Using these
initialized weights as starting points in the optimization model, the full
autoencoder network is then trained in the second step. The applicability of
denoising autoencoders has been demonstrated on a basic mathematical example
and several geophysical examples. For all the cases, autoencoders are found to
significantly reduce the noise in the input data.

small-scale internal channel networks, embedded within a solid structure. This
work examines leveraging viscous peeling as a mechanism to create and activate
soft actuators and microchannel networks, including complex elements such as
valves, without the need for fabrication of structures with micron-scale
internal cavities. We consider configurations composed of an internal slender
structure embedded within another elastic solid. Pressurized viscous fluid is
introduced into the interface between the two solids, thus peeling the two
elastic structures and creating internal cavities. Since the gap between the
solids is determined by the externally applied pressure, the characteristic
size of the fluidic network may vary in time and be much smaller than the
resolution of the fabrication method. This work presents a model for the highly
nonlinear elastic-viscous dynamics governing the flow and deformation of such
configurations. Fabrication and experimental demonstrations of micron-scale
valves and channel-networks created from millimeter scale structures are
presented, as well as the transient dynamics of viscous peeling based soft
actuators. The experimental data is compared with the suggested model, showing
very good agreement.

the system is closed with the assumption of a polytropic gas. In this case, the
pressure solely depends upon the density of the fluid and the energy equation
is not necessary anymore as the mass conservation and momentum conservation
then form a closed system. Further, the total energy acts as a convex
mathematical entropy function for the polytropic Euler equations. The
polytropic equation of state gives the pressure as a scaled power law of the
density in terms of the adiabatic index $\gamma$. As such, there are important
limiting cases contained within the polytropic model like the isothermal Euler
equations ($\gamma=1$) and the shallow water equations ($\gamma=2$). We first
mimic the continuous entropy analysis on the discrete level in a finite volume
context to get special numerical flux functions. Next, these numerical fluxes
are incorporated into a particular discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spectral element
framework where derivatives are approximated with summation-by-parts operators.
This guarantees a high-order accurate DG numerical approximation to the
polytropic Euler equations that is also consistent to its auxiliary total
energy behavior. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical
derivations, i.e., the entropic properties of the high order DG scheme.

remarkable power to leverage data for problem solving. In this paper, we
discuss the key motivations and roadblocks of using deep learning for wireless

recent studies that mobilize the deep learning philosophy in wireless resource
allocation and achieve impressive results. We first discuss deep learning
assisted optimization for resource allocation. We then highlight the deep

their redshift, are often found at the center of protoclusters of galaxies, and
are expected to evolve into the present day massive central cluster galaxies.
Thus they are a useful tool to explore structure formation in the young
Universe. Aims. 3C~294 is a powerful FR II type radio galaxy at z = 1.786. Past
studies have identified a clumpy structure, possibly indicative of a merging
system, as well as tentative evidence that 3C~294 hosts a dual active galactic
nucleus (AGN). Due to its proximity to a bright star, it has been subject to
various adaptive optics imaging studies. Method. In order to distinguish
between the various scenarios for 3C~294 we performed deep, high-resolution
adaptive optics near-infrared imaging and optical spectroscopy of 3C~294 with
the Large Binocular Telescope. Results. We resolve the 3C~294 system into three
distinct components separated by a few tenths of an arcsecond on our images.
One is compact, the other two are extended, and all appear to be non-stellar.
The nature of each component is unclear. The two extended components could be a
galaxy with an internal absorption feature, a galaxy merger, or two galaxies at
different redshifts. We can now uniquely associate the radio source of 3C~294
with one of the extended components. Based on our spectroscopy, we determined a
redshift of z = 1.784+-0.001, which is similar to the one previously cited. In
addition we found a previously unreported emission line at $\lambda$6749.4 \AA\
in our spectra. It is not clear that it originates from 3C~294. It could be the
Ne [IV] doublet lambda 2424/2426 AA at z = 1.783, or belong to the compact
component at a redshift of z ~ 4.56. We thus cannot unambiguously determine
whether 3C~294 hosts a dual AGN or a projected pair of AGNs.

CE$\nu$AS processes at 3$\sigma$ in 5 years of data taking. Keeping the same
amount of helium and the same data-taking period, we test the sensitivity to
the Weinberg angle and a possible neutrino magnetic moment for three different
scenarios: 60 g, 160 g, and 500 g of tritium. In the latter scenario, the
Standard Model (SM) value of the Weinberg angle can be measured with a
statistical uncertainty of
$\sin^2{\vartheta_W^{\mathrm{SM}}}^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$. This would represent the
lowest-energy measurement of $\sin^2{\vartheta_W}$, with the advantage of being
not affected by the uncertainties on the neutron form factor of the nucleus as
the current lowest-energy determination. Finally, we study the sensitivity of
this apparatus to a possible electron neutrino magnetic moment and we find that
using 60 g of tritium it is possible to set an upper limit of about

angle-encoded particle swarm optimisation to generate an inspecting path and
redistribute it to each UAV where communication links are embedded with an IoT
board for network and data processing capabilities. Data collected are
transmitted in real time through the network to remote computational units. To
detect potential damage or defects, an online image processing technique is
proposed and implemented based on histograms. Extensive simulation, experiments
and comparisons have been conducted to verify the validity and performance of
the proposed system.

semiconductor with huge potential for future nanoelectronics and spintronics
applications. In this work, we investigated the effect of an organic molecule
(benzene) in the close proximity of a Phosphorene nanoribbon. Our extensive
calculations reveal that the semiconducting nature of Phosphorene stays
unaffected as a result of the molecular adsorption while the transport
properties go through drastic changes. Under the influence of dopant atoms and
external strain, colossal changes in the conductivity is observed with a
maximum enhancement > 1500% which has not been observed earlier. This effect is
pretty robust against the (i) variation of system size, (ii) type, location and
concentration of dopants and (iii) nature and magnitude of the external strain.
Furthermore, we demonstrated how a gate voltage can be used to fine tune the
enhanced conductivity response in a Field-effect transistor (FET) structure.
Our results provide new direction for Phosphorene based nanoelectronics in
applications like sensing, switching where a higher level of conduction can
offer better resolution, higher ON/OFF ratio and superior energy efficiency.

rise to its unique electronic properties, such as a giant carrier mobility, and
this has triggered extensive research in applications, such as graphene
field-effect transistors (GFETs). However, GFETs generally exhibit a device
performance much inferior compared to the expected one. This has been
attributed to a strong dependence of the electronic properties of graphene on
the surrounding interfaces. Here we study the interface between a graphene
channel and SiO$_{2}$, and by means of photoelectron spectromicroscopy achieve
a detailed determination of the course of band alignment at the interface. Our
results show that the electronic properties of graphene are modulated by a
hydrophilic SiO$_{2}$ surface, but not by a hydrophobic one. By combining
photoelectron spectromicroscopy with GFET transport property characterization,
we demonstrate that the presence of electrical dipoles in the interface, which
reflects the SiO$_{2}$ surface electrochemistry, determines the GFET device
performance. A hysteresis in the resistance vs. gate voltage as a function of
polarity is ascribed to a reversal of the dipole layer by the gate voltage.
These data pave the way for GFET device optimization.

of the standard undergraduate computer science curriculum, leading to student
misunderstanding about how the two are related. We propose connecting the

discrete mathematics course---by using formal reasoning about programs as a
bridge between them.
  This article reports on Haverford and Grinnell College's experience in
constructing the end points of this bridge between CS1 and discrete
mathematics. Haverford's long-standing ""3-2-1"" curriculum introduces code
reasoning in conjunction with introductory programming concepts, and Grinnell's
discrete mathematics introduces code reasoning as a motivation for logic and
formal deduction. Both courses present code reasoning in a style based on
symbolic code execution techniques from the programming language community, but
tuned to address the particulars of each course.
  These courses rely primarily on traditional means of proof authoring with
pen-and-paper. This is unsatisfactory for students who receive no feedback
until grading on their work and instructors who must shoulder the burden of
interpreting students' proofs and giving useful feedback. To this end, we also
describe the current state of Orca, an in-development proof assistant for
undergraduate education that we are developing to address these issues in our
courses.
  Finally, in teaching our courses, we have discovered a number of educational
research questions about the effectiveness of code reasoning in bridging the
gap between programming and mathematics, and the ability of tools like \orca to
support this pedagogy. We pose these research questions as next steps to
formalize our initial experiences in our courses with the hope of eventually
generalizing our approaches for wider adoption.

variation of the phases of the maps in the desynchronised group shows
structures similar to spatiotemporally intermittent regions. Using the complex

parameter space which supports chimera states of this type, as well as other
types of phase configurations such as globally phase synchronised states, two
phase clustered states and fully phase desynchronised states. We estimate the
volume of the basin of attraction of each kind of solution. The STI chimera
region is studied in further detail via numerical and analytic stability
analysis, and the Lyapunov spectrum is calculated. This state is identified to
be hyperchaotic as the two largest Lyapunov exponents are found to be positive.
The distributions of laminar and burst lengths in the incoherent region of the
chimera show exponential behaviour. The average fraction of laminar/burst sites
is identified to be the important quantity which governs the dynamics of the

By imposing some simple constraints, arisen from group theoretical
interpretation of the field equations, a new four-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet
(GB)-like action has been introduced with the related field equations
transforming according to the unitary irreducible representations (UIR's) of dS
group. Since, the field equations transform according to the UIR's of dS group,
the GB-like action, we just obtained, is expected to be a successful model of

been solved in terms of a gauge-fixing parameter ${\cal{C}}$. It has been shown
that the solution can be written as the multiplication of a symmetric rank-2
polarization tensor and a massless minimally coupled scalar field on dS space.
The Gupta-Bleuler quantization method has been utilized and the covariant
two-point function has been calculated in terms of the massless minimally
coupled scalar two-point function, using the ambient space notations. It has
been written in terms of dS intrinsic coordinates from the ambient space
counterpart. The two-point functions are dS invariant and free of any

modified gravity and it can produce significant results in the contexts of

architecture search with multiple resource constraints, \eg, model size,
compute complexity or intensity, which is crucial for deployment in widespread
platforms such as mobile and cloud. We compare EPNAS against other
state-of-the-art (SoTA) network architectures (\eg,
MobileNetV2~\cite{mobilenetv2}) and efficient NAS algorithms (\eg,
ENAS~\cite{pham2018efficient}, and PNAS~\cite{Liu2017b}) on image recognition
tasks using CIFAR10 and ImageNet. On both datasets, EPNAS is superior \wrt
architecture searching speed and recognition accuracy.

  Walker, Leroy Cronin","Quantifying the pathways to life using assembly spaces","manuscript with 10 figures and supplementary data",,,,"cs.AI physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We have developed the concept of pathway assembly to explore the amount of
extrinsic information required to build an object. To quantify this information
in an agnostic way, we present a method to determine the amount of pathway
assembly information contained within such an object by deconstructing the
object into its irreducible parts, and then evaluating the minimum number of
steps to reconstruct the object along any pathway. The mathematical
formalisation of this approach uses an assembly space. By finding the minimal
number of steps contained in the route by which the objects can be assembled
within that space, we can compare how much information (I) is gained from
knowing this pathway assembly index (PA) according to I_PA=log (|N|)/(|N_PA |)
where, for an end product with PA=x, N is the set of objects possible that can
be created from the same irreducible parts within x steps regardless of PA, and
NPA is the subset of those objects with the precise pathway assembly index
PA=x. Applying this formalism to objects formed in 1D, 2D and 3D space allows
us to identify objects in the world or wider Universe that have high assembly
numbers. We propose that objects with PA greater than a threshold are important
because these are uniquely identifiable as those that must have been produced
by biological or technological processes, rather than the assembly occurring
via unbiased random processes alone. We think this approach is needed to help
identify the new physical and chemical laws needed to understand what life is,
by quantifying what life does.

certain mathematical constants, for which the elements in the simple continued
fraction appears to be random. As an illustrative example, one can consider
$\pi = \{x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots x_n\}$, where $x$'s are the continued fraction
elements computed with an exact value of $\pi$ up to $N$ precision. We
numerically compute probability distribution for the elements and observe a
striking power-law behavior $P(x)\sim x^{-2}$. The statistical analysis
indicates that the elements are uncorrelated and the scaling is robust with
respect to the precision. Our arguments reveal that the underlying mechanism
generating such a scaling may be sample space reducing process.

  Prediction",,,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a novel approach for extracting a Bag-of-Words (BoW)
representation based on a Neural Network codebook. The conventional BoW model
is based on a dictionary (codebook) built from elementary representations which
are selected randomly or by using a clustering algorithm on a training dataset.
A metric is then used to assign unseen elementary representations to the
closest dictionary entries in order to produce a histogram. In the proposed
approach, an autoencoder (AE) encompasses the role of both the dictionary
creation and the assignment metric. The dimension of the encoded layer of the
AE corresponds to the size of the dictionary and the output of its neurons
represents the assignment metric. Experimental results for the continuous
emotion prediction task on the AVEC 2017 audio dataset have shown an
improvement of the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) from 0.225 to
0.322 for arousal dimension and from 0.244 to 0.368 for valence dimension
relative to the conventional BoW version implemented in a baseline system.

properly address this question, our methodology must deal with issues of
non-adherence, secular trends in health outcomes, and lack of treatment overlap
due to sharp uptake of the generic once it becomes available. We define,
identify (under assumptions) and estimate (using G-computation) a causal effect

applied to genetic expression in and in the companion paper and proposes its
interpretations in terms of statistical physics and machine learning. In order
to further underline the Hochschild cohomological nature af information
functions and chain rules, following, the computation of the cohomology in low
degrees is detailed to show more directly that the $k$ multivariate
mutual-informations (I_k) are k-coboundaries. The k-cocycles condition
corresponds to I_k=0, generalizing statistical independence. Hence the
cohomology quantifies the statistical dependences and the obstruction to
factorization. The topological approach allows to investigate information in
the multivariate case without the assumptions of independent identically
distributed variables and without mean field approximations. We develop the
computationally tractable subcase of simplicial information cohomology
represented by entropy H_k and information I_k landscapes and their respective
paths. The I_1 component defines a self-internal energy U_k, and I_k,k>1
components define the contribution to a free energy G_k (the total correlation)
of the k-body interactions. The set of information paths in simplicial
structures is in bijection with the symmetric group and random processes,
provides a trivial topological expression of the 2nd law of thermodynamic. The
local minima of free-energy, related to conditional information negativity, and
conditional independence, characterize a minimum free energy complex. This
complex formalizes the minimum free-energy principle in topology, provides a
definition of a complex system, and characterizes a multiplicity of local
minima that quantifies the diversity observed in biology. I give an
interpretation of this complex in terms of frustration in glass and of Van Der
Walls k-body interactions for data points.

exist in two-dimensional ferromagnetic condensed matter systems with electron
spin polarization P = 1. The proposed spin-polarized spin-1 phases can be
realized in ferromagnetic transition metal dihalides MX2 monolayers
effectively. By using first principle calculations, we show that a small
compressive strain leads MX2 monolayers to be spin-one Dirac half-metal for M =
Fe and X = Br, Cl while spin-one Dirac spin-gapless semiconductor for M = Co
and X = Br, Cl. Spin-one Dirac spin-gapless semiconductors CoBr2 and CoCl2
embeds flat band ferromagnetism where spin-orbit coupling opens a topologically

determinants of consumers' health behavior towards Human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccination informed by the Integrated Behavior Model (IBM).
  Methods We used three Twitter datasets spanning from 2014 to 2018. We
preprocessed and geocoded the tweets, and then built a rule-based model that
classified each tweet into either promotional information or consumers'
discussions. We applied topic modeling to discover major themes, and
subsequently explored the associations between the topics learned from
consumers' discussions and the responses of HPV-related questions in the Health
Information National Trends Survey (HINTS).
  Results We collected 2,846,495 tweets and analyzed 335,681 geocoded tweets.
Through topic modeling, we identified 122 high-quality topics. The most
discussed consumer topic is ""cervical cancer screening""; while in promotional
tweets, the most popular topic is to increase awareness of ""HPV causes cancer"".
87 out of the 122 topics are correlated between promotional information and
consumers' discussions. Guided by IBM, we examined the alignment between our
Twitter findings and the results obtained from HINTS. 35 topics can be mapped
to HINTS questions by keywords, 112 topics can be mapped to IBM constructs, and
45 topics have statistically significant correlations with HINTS responses in
terms of geographic distributions.
  Conclusion Not only mining Twitter to assess consumers' health behaviors can
obtain results comparable to surveys but can yield additional insights via a
theory-driven approach. Limitations exist, nevertheless, these encouraging
results impel us to develop innovative ways of leveraging social media in the
changing health communication landscape.

evolution of our natural satellite Moon, born from impact generated terrestrial
debris in the equatorial plane of high obliquity, high angular momentum Earth.
This paper examines their findings critically in the light of advanced
kinematic model (AKM) which includes Earth's obliquity (\phi), Moon's orbital
plane inclination (\alpha) , Moon's obliquity (\beta) and lunar's orbit
eccentricity (e). For the real Earth-Moon (E-M) system, the history of
evolution of \phi, \alpha, \beta, e and (length of month)/(length of day) or
LOM/LOD is traced from 45R_{E} to 60.33R_{E} where R_{E} is Earth Radius. It is
shown that AKM's valid range of application is from 45R_{E} to 60.33R_{E} . The
evolution of {\alpha}, \beta, e is in correspondence with the simulation
results of Matija Cuk et.al (2016) but evolution of Earth's obliquity has a
break at 45R_{E} . According to AKM , earlier than 45RE Earth should achieve
zero degree obliquity in order to achieve the modern value of 23.44{\deg}
obliquity. Cuk et al (2016) do not explain how this can be achieved.AKM stands
vindicated because using protocol exchange algorithm (described in S6 SOM), AKM
has successfully given precise theoretical formalism of Observed LOD curve for
the last 1.2Gy time span opening the way for early warning and forecasting
methods for Earth-quake and sudden volcanic eruptions(See S7 of SOM).
