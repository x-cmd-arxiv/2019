vertical magnetic fields on the structure of geometrically thin ($H/r \approx
0.05$) accretion disks in the Newtonian limit. We consider initial mid-plane
gas to magnetic pressure ratios $\beta_0 = 1000,\, 300$ and $100$, spanning the
transition between weakly and strongly magnetized accretion regimes. We find
that magnetic pressure is important for the disks' vertical structure in all
three cases, with accretion occurring at $z/R\approx 0.2$ in the two most
strongly magnetized models. The disk midplane shows outflow rather than
accretion. Accretion through the surface layers is driven mainly by stress due
to coherent large scale magnetic field rather than by turbulent stress.
Equivalent viscosity parameters measured from our simulations show similar
dependencies on initial $\beta_0$ to those seen in shearing box simulations,
though the disk midplane is not magnetic pressure dominated even for the
strongest magnetic field case. Winds are present but are not the dominant
driver of disk evolution. Over the (limited) duration of our simulations, we
find evidence that the net flux attains a quasi-steady state at levels that can
stably maintain a strongly magnetized disk. We suggest that geometrically thin
accretion disks in observed systems may commonly exist in a magnetically
""elevated"" state, characterized by non-zero but modest vertical magnetic
fluxes, with potentially important implications for disk phenomenology in X-ray
binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN).

of this work is to understand the usage of Kotlin features considering four
aspects: i) which features are adopted, ii) what is the degree of adoption,
iii)when are these features added into Android applications for the first time,
and iv) how the usage of features evolves along with applications' evolution.
Method: Exploring the source code of 387 Android applications, we identify the
usage of Kotlin features on each version application's version and compute the
moment that each feature is used for the first time. Finally, we identify the
evolution trend that better describes the usage of these features. Results: 15
out of 26 features are used on at least 50% of applications. Moreover, we found
that type inference, lambda and safe call are the most used features. Also, we
observed that the most used Kotlin features are those first included on Android
applications. Finally, we report that the majority of applications tend to add
more instances of 24 out of 26 features along with their evolution. {\bf
Conclusions:} Our study generates 7 main findings. We present their
implications, which are addressed to developers, researchers and tool builders
in order to foster the use of Kotlin features to develop Android applications.

scaling which reaches below the shot noise limit, even when seeding the spatial
mode which does not interact with the sample - or when seeding the undetected
mode. It is a hybrid of a linear and a non-linear (Yurke-Type) interferometer,
and aside from the supersensitivity, is distinguished from other systems by
""preferring"" an imbalance in the gains of the two non-linearities (with the
second gain being optimal at low values), and non-monotonic behavior of the
sensitivity as a function of the gain of the second non-linearity. Furthermore,
the setup allows use of subtracted intensity measurements, instead of direct
(additive) or homodyne measurements - a significant practical advantage.
Bright, super-sensitive phase estimation of an object with different light
fields for interaction and detection is possible, with various potential
applications, especially in cases where the sample may be sensitive to light,
or is most interesting in frequency domains outside what is easily detected, or
when desiring bright-light phase estimation with sensitive/delicate detectors.
We use an analysis in terms of general squeezing and discover that
super-sensitivity occurs only in this case - that is, the effect is not present

previous analyses and experiments have focused on.

accretion of volatiles, and therefore by the division of volatiles between gas
and solids in planet-forming disks. For hyper-volatiles such as CO, this
division is regulated by a combination of binding energies, and by the ability
of other ice components to entrap. Water ice is known for its ability to trap
CO and other volatile species. In this study we explore whether another common
interstellar and cometary ice component, CO2, is able to trap CO as well. We
measure entrapment of CO molecules in CO2 ice through temperature programmed
desorption (TPD) experiments on CO2:CO ice mixtures. We find that CO2 ice traps
CO with a typical efficiency of 40-60% of the initially deposited CO molecules
for a range of ice thicknesses between 7 and 50ML, and ice mixture ratios
between 1:1 and 9:1. The entrapment efficiency increases with ice thickness and
CO dilution. We also run analogous H2O:CO experiments and find that under
comparable experimental conditions CO2 ice entraps CO more efficiently than H2O
ice up to the onset of CO2 desorption at ~70K. We speculate that this may be
due to different ice restructuring dynamics in H2O and CO2 ices around the CO
desorption temperature. Importantly, the ability of CO2 to entrap CO may change
the expected division between gas and solids for CO and other hyper-volatiles
exterior to the CO2 snowline during planet formation.

object or the latching of a door, are often viewed as inconvenient
discontinuities that make manipulation difficult. However, when these
transitions are well-understood, they can be leveraged to reduce uncertainty or
aid manipulation---for example, wiggling a screw to determine if it is fully
inserted or not. Current model-free reinforcement learning approaches require
large amounts of data to learn to leverage such dynamics, scale poorly as
problem complexity grows, and do not transfer well to significantly different
problems. By contrast, hierarchical POMDP planning-based methods scale well via
plan decomposition, work well on novel problems, and directly consider
uncertainty, but often rely on precise hand-specified models and task
decompositions. To combine the advantages of these opposing paradigms, we
propose a new method, MICAH, which given unsegmented data of an object's motion
under applied actions, (1) detects changepoints in the object motion model
using action-conditional inference, (2) estimates the individual local motion
models with their parameters, and (3) converts them into a hybrid automaton
that is compatible with hierarchical POMDP planning. We show that model
learning under MICAH is more accurate and robust to noise than prior
approaches. Further, we combine MICAH with a hierarchical POMDP planner to
demonstrate that the learned models are rich enough to be used for performing
manipulation tasks under uncertainty that require the objects to be used in
novel ways not encountered during training.

characterize the response of the VGG-19 DNN to images of the Scintillating Grid
visual illusion, in which white dots are perceived to be partially black. We
observed a significant deviation from the expected monotonic relation between
VGG-19 representational dissimilarity and dot whiteness in the Scintillating

increase and then, remarkably, a decrease (non-monotonicity) in
representational dissimilarity. In control images, mostly monotonic relations
between representational dissimilarity and dot whiteness were observed.
Furthermore, the dot whiteness level corresponding to the maximal
representational dissimilarity (i.e. onset of non-monotonic dissimilarity)
matched closely with that corresponding to the onset of illusion perception in
human observers. As such, the non-monotonic response in the DNN is a potential
model correlate for human illusion perception.

for the problems of few-shot and zero-shot action recognition. At the heart of
our network is a meta-learning approach that learns to compare representations
of variable temporal length, that is, either two videos of different length (in
the case of few-shot action recognition) or a video and a semantic
representation such as word vector (in the case of zero-shot action
recognition). By contrast to other works in few-shot and zero-shot action
recognition, we a) utilise attention mechanisms so as to perform temporal
alignment, and b) learn a deep-distance measure on the aligned representations
at video segment level. We adopt an episode-based training scheme and train our
network in an end-to-end manner. The proposed method does not require any
fine-tuning in the target domain or maintaining additional representations as
is the case of memory networks. Experimental results show that the proposed
architecture outperforms the state of the art in few-shot action recognition,
and achieves competitive results in zero-shot action recognition.

address the interaction of input parameters in software systems. In many
applications, the technique has been used as a systematic sampling technique to
sample the enormous possibilities of test cases. In the last decade, most of
the research activities focused on the generation of CIT test suites as it is a
computationally complex problem. Although promising, less effort has been paid
for the application of CIT. In general, to apply the CIT, practitioners must
identify the input parameters for the Software-under-test (SUT), feed these
parameters to the CIT tool to generate the test suite, and then run those tests
on the application with some pass and fail criteria for verification. Using
this approach, CIT is used as a black-box testing technique without knowing the
effect of the internal code. Although useful, practically, not all the
parameters having the same impact on the SUT. This paper introduces a different
approach to use the CIT as a gray-box testing technique by considering the
internal code structure of the SUT to know the impact of each input parameter
and thus use this impact in the test generation stage. We applied our approach
to five reliable case studies. The results showed that this approach would help
to detect new faults as compared to the equal impact parameter approach.

interpretation by resolving model-dependent degeneracies. The typical
instrument approach is that incident X-rays scatter off a plastic scintillator
into an adjacent scintillator cell. In all missions to date, the scintillators
are read out using traditional vacuum tube photo-multipliers (PMTs). The advent
of solid-state PMTs (""silicon PM"" or ""MPPC"") is attractive for space-based
instruments since the devices are compact, robust and require a low bias
voltage. We have characterised the plastic scintillator, EJ-248M, optically
coupled to a multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) and read out with the Citiroc
ASIC. A light-yield of 1.6 photoelectrons/keV has been obtained, with a low
energy detection threshold of $\lesssim$5 keV at room temperature. We have also
constructed an MPPC-based polarimeter-demonstrator in order to investigate the
feasibility of such an approach for future instruments. Incident X-rays scatter
from a plastic-scintillator bar to surrounding cerium-doped GAGG (Gadolinium
Aluminium Gallium Garnet) scintillators yielding time-coincident signals in the
scintillators. We have determined the polarimetric response of this set-up
using both unpolarised and polarised $\sim$50 keV X-rays. We observe a clear
asymmetry in the GAGG counting rates for the polarised beam. The low-energy
detection threshold in the plastic scintillator can be further reduced using a
coincidence technique. The demonstrated polarimeter design shows promise as a
space-based Compton polarimeter and we discuss ways in which our polarimeter
can be adapted for such a mission.

the constraints imposed by lattice symmetry on the energy landscape.
Quasi-static energy minimization naturally induces bursty plastic flow and
shape change in the crystal due to the underlying coordinated basin-hopping
local strain activity. This is mediated by the nucleation, interaction, and
annihilation of lattice defects occurring with no need for auxiliary
hypotheses. Numerical simulations highlight the marked effect of symmetry on
all these processes. The kinematical atlas induced by symmetry on strain space
elucidates how the arrangement of the energy extremals and the possible
bifurcations of the strain-jump paths affect the plastification mechanisms and
defect-pattern complexity in the lattice.

single-qubit measurements, and thus, only parts of the Hamiltonian which form
mutually qubit-wise commuting groups can be measured simultaneously. The number
of such groups in the electronic structure Hamiltonians grows as $N^4$, where
$N$ is the number of qubits, and thus puts serious restrictions on the size of
the systems that can be studied. Using a partitioning of the system Hamiltonian
as a linear combination of unitary operators we found a circuit formulation of
the VQE algorithm that allows one to measure a group of fully anti-commuting

Numerical comparison of the unitary partitioning to previously used grouping of

much effort to increase the spatial resolution and simulation skill of RCMs,
yet the extent to which this improves the projection of hydrological change is
unclear. Here, we evaluate the skill of five reanalysis-driven Euro-CORDEX RCMs
in simulating precipitation and temperature, and as drivers of a hydrological
model to simulate river flow on four UK catchments covering different physical,
climatic and hydrological characteristics. We test whether high-resolution RCMs
provide added value, through analysis of two RCM resolutions, 50 km and 12.5
km, which are also bias-corrected employing the parametric quantile-mapping
(QM) method, using the normal distribution for temperature, and the Gamma (GQM)
and Double Gamma (DGQM) distributions for precipitation. In a small catchment
with complex topography, the 12.5 km RCMs outperform their 50 km version for
precipitation and temperature, but when used in combination with the
hydrological model, fail to capture the observed river flow distribution. In
the other (larger) catchments, only one high-resolution RCM consistently
outperforms its low-resolution version, implying that in general there is no
added value from using the high-resolution RCMs in those catchments. GQM
decreases most of the simulation biases, except for extreme precipitation and
high flows, which are further decreased by DGQM. Bias correction does not
improve the representation of daily temporal variability, but it does for
monthly variability, in particular when applying DGQM. Overall, an increase in
RCM resolution does not imply a better simulation of hydrology and
bias-correction represents an alternative to ease decision-making.

constant competitive ratio on multiple servers when server speeds are

of this paper is to show that multi-server SRPT can be constant competitive,
with a competitive ratio that only depends on the power-usage function of the
servers, but not on the number of jobs/servers or the job sizes (unlike when
speed scaling is not allowed). When all job sizes are unity, we show that
round-robin routing is optimal and can achieve the same competitive ratio as
the best known algorithm for the single server problem. Finally, we show that a
class of greedy dispatch policies, including policies that route to the least

job arrivals are stochastic, with Poisson arrivals and i.i.d. job sizes, we
show that random routing and a simple gated-static speed scaling algorithm

significant capability of neural computing in many challenging applications.
Although DNNs are derived from emulating biological neurons, there still exist
doubts over whether or not DNNs are the final and best model to emulate the
mechanism of human intelligence. In particular, there are two discrepancies
between computational DNN models and the observed facts of biological neurons.
First, human neurons are interconnected randomly, while DNNs need
carefully-designed architectures to work properly. Second, human neurons
usually have a long spiking latency (~100ms) which implies that not many layers
can be involved in making a decision, while DNNs could have hundreds of layers
to guarantee high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new computational
model, namely shallow unorganized neural networks (SUNNs), in contrast to
ANNs/DNNs. The proposed SUNNs differ from standard ANNs or DNNs in three
fundamental aspects: 1) SUNNs are based on an adaptive neuron cell model, Smart
Neurons, that allows each artificial neuron cell to adaptively respond to its
inputs rather than carrying out a fixed weighted-sum operation like the classic
neuron model in ANNs/DNNs; 2) SUNNs can cope with computational tasks with very
shallow architectures; 3) SUNNs have a natural topology with random
interconnections, as the human brain does, and as proposed by Turing's B-type
unorganized machines. We implemented the proposed SUNN architecture and tested
it on a number of unsupervised early stage visual perception tasks.
Surprisingly, such simple shallow architectures achieved very good results in
our experiments. The success of our new computational model makes it the first
workable example of Turing's B-Type unorganized machine that can achieve
comparable or better performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms.

dynamics and the bifurcations between transport structures with changes in the

occur in natural aquifer systems. These results clearly demonstrate that

of IoT devices around the world, where the IoT devices collect and share
information to reflect status of the physical world. The Autonomous Control
System (ACS), on the other hand, performs control functions on the physical
systems without external intervention over an extended period of time. The
integration of IoT and ACS results in a new concept - autonomous IoT (AIoT).
The sensors collect information on the system status, based on which the
intelligent agents in the IoT devices as well as the Edge/Fog/Cloud servers
make control decisions for the actuators to react. In order to achieve
autonomy, a promising method is for the intelligent agents to leverage the
techniques in the field of artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement
learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for decision making. In
this paper, we first provide a tutorial of DRL, and then propose a general
model for the applications of RL/DRL in AIoT. Next, a comprehensive survey of
the state-of-art research on DRL for AIoT is presented, where the existing
works are classified and summarized under the umbrella of the proposed general
DRL model. Finally, the challenges and open issues for future research are
identified.

localized, time-shifted events from multiple sources, the goal of Convolutional
Dictionary Learning (CDL) is to identify the location of the events--by
Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC)--and learn the template for each source--by
Convolutional Dictionary Update (CDU). In practice, because we observe samples
of the continuous-time signal on a uniformly-sampled grid in discrete time,
classical CSC methods can only produce estimates of the times when the events
occur on this grid, which degrades the performance of the CDU. We introduce a
CDL framework that significantly reduces the errors arising from performing the
estimation in discrete time. Specifically, we construct an expanded dictionary
that comprises, not only discrete-time shifts of the templates, but also
interpolated variants, obtained by bandlimited interpolation, that account for
continuous-time shifts. For CSC, we develop a novel computationally efficient
CSC algorithm, termed Convolutional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with
interpolated dictionary (COMP-INTERP). We benchmarked COMP-INTERP to
Contiunuous Basis Pursuit (CBP), the state-of-the-art CSC algorithm for
estimating off-the-grid events, and demonstrate, on simulated data, that 1)
COMP-INTERP achieves a similar level of accuracy, and 2) is two orders of

also show that 3) dictionary update with the overcomplete dictionary yields
more accurate templates. Finally, we apply the algorithms to the spike sorting

  with Random Sampling",,,,,"cs.DM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many problems in signal processing and machine learning can be formalized as
weak submodular optimization tasks. For such problems, a simple greedy
algorithm (\textsc{Greedy}) is guaranteed to find a solution achieving the
objective with a value no worse than $1-e^{-1/c}$ of the optimal, where $c$ is
the multiplicative weak-submodularity constant. Due to the high cost of
querying large-scale systems, the complexity of \textsc{Greedy} becomes
prohibitive in contemporary applications. In this work, we study the tradeoff
between performance and complexity when one resorts to random sampling
strategies to reduce the query complexity of \textsc{Greedy}. Specifically, we
quantify the effect of uniform sampling strategies on \textsc{Greedy}'s
performance through two metrics: (i) probability of identifying an optimal
subset, and (ii) suboptimality with respect to the optimal solution. The latter
implies that uniform sampling strategies with a fixed sampling size achieve a
non-trivial approximation factor; however, we show that with overwhelming
probability, these methods fail to find the optimal subset. Our analysis shows
that the failure of uniform sampling strategies with fixed sample size can be
circumvented by successively increasing the size of the search space. Building
upon this insight, we propose a simple progressive stochastic greedy algorithm
and study its approximation guarantees. Moreover, we demonstrate effectiveness
of the proposed method in dimensionality reduction applications and feature
selection tasks for clustering and object tracking.

via experimentation. Bayesian optimization offers a sample-efficient tool for
experimental design when experiments are expensive. Often, expert experimenters
have 'hunches' about the behavior of the experimental system, offering
potentials to further improve the efficiency. In this paper, we consider
per-variable monotonic trend in the underlying property that results in a
unimodal trend in those variables for a target value optimization. For example,
sweetness of a candy is monotonic to the sugar content. However, to obtain a
target sweetness, the utility of the sugar content becomes a unimodal function,
which peaks at the value giving the target sweetness and falls off both ways.
In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve such problems that achieves
two main objectives: a) the monotonicity information is used to the fullest
extent possible, whilst ensuring that b) the convergence guarantee remains
intact. This is achieved by a two-stage Gaussian process modeling, where the
first stage uses the monotonicity trend to model the underlying property, and
the second stage uses `virtual' samples, sampled from the first, to model the
target value optimization function. The process is made theoretically
consistent by adding appropriate adjustment factor in the posterior
computation, necessitated because of using the `virtual' samples. The proposed
method is evaluated through both simulations and real world experimental design
problems of a) new short polymer fiber with the target length, and b) designing
of a new three dimensional porous scaffolding with a target porosity. In all
scenarios our method demonstrates faster convergence than the basic Bayesian
optimization approach not using such `hunches'.

suggests that the minimum radius behaves as a power law in time with exponent
$\alpha = 1/3$ just before and after pinch-off has occurred, regardless of the
initial conditions; our numerical results support this prediction. Further, we

exoplanetary magnetic fields. Here we report the derivation of the magnetic
field strengths of four hot Jupiter systems using the power observed in Ca II K
emission modulated by magnetic star-planet interactions. By approximating the
fractional energy released in the Ca II K line we find that the surface
magnetic field values for the hot Jupiters in our sample range from 20 G to 120
G, ~10-100 times larger than the values predicted by dynamo scaling laws for
planets with rotation periods of ~2 - 4 days. On the other hand, these value
are in agreement with scaling laws relating the magnetic field strength to the
internal heat flux in giant planets. Large planetary magnetic field strengths
may produce observable electron-cyclotron maser radio emission by preventing
the maser from being quenched by the planet's ionosphere. Intensive radio
monitoring of hot Jupiter systems will help confirm these field values and
inform on the generation mechanism of magnetic fields in this important class

sequential polyhedral approximation of completely-positive cones and analyze

superconducting logic families, potentially huge gain compared with
state-of-the-art CMOS. In 2016, the successful fabrication and testing of
AQFP-based circuits with the scale of 83,000 JJs have demonstrated the
scalability and potential of implementing large-scale systems using AQFP. As a
result, it will be promising for AQFP in high-performance computing and deep
space applications, with Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration as an
important example. Besides ultra-high energy efficiency, AQFP exhibits two
unique characteristics: the deep pipelining nature since each AQFP logic gate
is connected with an AC clock signal, which increases the difficulty to avoid
RAW hazards; the second is the unique opportunity of true random number
generation (RNG) using a single AQFP buffer, far more efficient than RNG in
CMOS. We point out that these two characteristics make AQFP especially
compatible with the \emph{stochastic computing} (SC) technique, which uses a
time-independent bit sequence for value representation, and is compatible with
the deep pipelining nature. Further, the application of SC has been
investigated in DNNs in prior work, and the suitability has been illustrated as
SC is more compatible with approximate computations. This work is the first to
develop an SC-based DNN acceleration framework using AQFP technology.

chain displays a double-hump structure in the fidelity susceptibility with both
peak positions and heights scaling logarithmically to their corresponding
thermodynamic values. This scaling is precisely as expected for two
Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions located symmetrically about
the self-dual point, and so confirms numerically the theoretical scenario that
sets $p=5$ as the lowest $p$ supporting BKT transitions in
$\mathbb{Z}_p$-symmetric clock models. For our U(1)-symmetric, non-self-dual
minimal modification of the $p$-clock model we find that the phase diagram
depends strongly on the parity of $p$ and only one BKT transition survives for
$p\geq 5$. Using asymptotic calculus we map the self-dual clock model exactly,

bond-algebraic dualities we estimate the critical BKT transition temperatures

massive environmental modification that will be well beyond human capability
for the foreseeable future. Here we present a new approach to this problem. We
show that widespread regions of the surface of Mars could be made habitable to
photosynthetic life in the future via a solid-state analogue to Earth's
atmospheric greenhouse effect. Specifically, we demonstrate via experiments and
modelling that under martian environmental conditions, a 2 to 3-cm thick layer
of silica (SiO2) aerogel will simultaneously transmit sufficient visible light
for photosynthesis, block hazardous ultraviolet radiation, and raise
temperatures underneath permanently to above the melting point of water,
without the need for any internal heat source. Placing silica aerogel shields
over sufficiently ice-rich regions of the martian surface could therefore allow
photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent intervention. This
regional approach to making Mars habitable is much more achievable than global
atmospheric modification. In addition, it can be developed systematically
starting from minimal resources, and can be further tested in extreme
environments on Earth today.

secret and the aim is to reach a situation in which all agents know all
secrets. Such protocols rely on a point-to-point or group communication.
Distributed epistemic gossip protocols use epistemic formulas in the component
programs for the agents. The advantage of the use of epistemic logic is that
the resulting protocols are very concise and amenable for a simple
verification.
  Recently, we introduced a natural modal logic that allows one to express
distributed epistemic gossip protocols and to reason about their correctness.
We proved that the resulting protocols are implementable and that all aspects
of their correctness, including termination, are decidable. To establish these
results we showed that both the definition of semantics and of truth of the
underlying logic are decidable. We also showed that the analogous results hold
for an extension of this logic with the 'common knowledge' operator.
  However, several, often deceptively simple, questions about this logic and
the corresponding gossip protocols remain open. The purpose of this paper is to
list and elucidate these questions and provide for them an appropriate
background information in the form of partial of related results.

literature on epistemic logic in computer science and game theory has focused
on multi-agent epistemic reasoning, with the single-agent 4 and 5 axioms
largely taken for granted. In the relevant multi-agent scenarios, it is often
important to reason about what agent A believes about what agent B believes
about what agent A believes; but it is rarely important to reason just about
what agent A believes about what agent A believes. This raises the question of
the extent to which single-agent introspection axioms actually matter for
multi-agent epistemic reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and answer this
question. To formalize the question, we first define a set of multi-agent
formulas that we call agent-alternating formulas, including formulas like Box_a
Box_b Box_a p but not formulas like Box_a Box_a p. We then prove, for the case
of belief, that if one starts with multi-agent K or KD, then adding both the 4

agent-alternating formulas -- in this sense, introspection axioms do not
matter. By contrast, we show that such conservativity results fail for
knowledge and multi-agent KT, though they hold with respect to a smaller class
of agent-nonrepeating formulas.

Second, qualitative belief reduces to fully introspective knowledge in a

multi-domain channel embedding method combined with self-attention mechanism is
proposed to extract channel features from multiple domains simultaneously. This
'one model to fit them all' solution employs available wireless channel data as
the only data set for self-supervised pre-training. With the permission of
users, network operators or other organizations can make use of some available
user specific data to fine-tune this pre-trained realistic channel model for
applications on channel-related downstream tasks. Moreover, even without
fine-tuning, we show that the pre-trained realistic channel model itself is a
great tool with its understanding of wireless channel.

  Gaussian Distribution","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the paradigm of sphere decoding (SD) based on lattice Gaussian
distribution is studied, where the sphere radius $D>0$ in the sense of
Euclidean distance is characterized by the initial pruning size $K>1$, the
standard deviation $\sigma>0$ and a regularization term
$\rho_{\sigma,\mathbf{y}}(\Lambda)>0$ ($\Lambda$ denotes the lattice,
$\mathbf{y}$ is the query point). In this way, extra freedom is obtained for
analytical diagnosis of both the decoding performance and complexity. Based on
it, the equivalent SD (ESD) algorithm is firstly proposed, and we show it is
exactly the same with the classic Fincke-Pohst SD but characterizes the sphere
radius with $D=\sigma\sqrt{2\ln K}$. By fixing $\sigma$ properly, we show that
the complexity of ESD measured by the number of visited nodes is upper bounded
by $|S|<nK$, thus resulting in a tractable decoding trade-off solely determined
by $K$. In order to further exploit the decoding potential, the regularized SD
(RSD) algorithm based on Klein's sampling probability is proposed, which
achieves a better decoding trade-off than the equivalent SD by fully utilizing
the regularization terms. Moreover, besides the designed criterion of pruning
threshold, another decoding criterion named as candidate protection is proposed
to solve the decoding problems in the cases of small $K$, which generalizes
both the regularized SD and equivalent SD from maximum likelihood (ML) decoding
to bounded distance decoding (BDD). Finally, simulation results based on MIMO
detection are presented to confirm the tractable decoding trade-off of the
proposed lattice Gaussian distribution-based SD algorithms.

relatively complex hardware framework and low processing speed, which block
MNNs' hardware realization. A non-STDP based unsupervised MNN is constructed in

structures including feedforward and crossbar, non-STDP based MNNs not only
remain the same advantages as STDP based MNNs including high accuracy and
convergence speed in pattern recognition, but also better hardware performance
as few hardware resources and higher processing speed. By virtue of the
combination of memristive character and simple mechanism, non-STDP based MNNs
have better hardware compatibility, which may give a new viewpoint for
memristive neural networks' engineering applications.

number of signal observations $\mathbf{z}$'s for a stable estimate. In this
work, we assume instead the availability of a relevant feature vector
$\mathbf{f}_i$ per node $i$, from which we compute an optimal feature graph via
optimization of a feature metric. Specifically, we alternately optimize the
diagonal and off-diagonal entries of a Mahalanobis distance matrix $\mathbf{M}$
by minimizing the graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) $\mathbf{z}^{\top}
\mathbf{L} \mathbf{z}$, where edge weight is $w_{i,j} = \exp\{-(\mathbf{f}_i -
\mathbf{f}_j)^{\top} \mathbf{M} (\mathbf{f}_i - \mathbf{f}_j) \}$, given a
single observation $\mathbf{z}$. We optimize diagonal entries via proximal

linear inequalities derived from the Gershgorin circle theorem. To optimize
off-diagonal entries, we design a block descent algorithm that iteratively
optimizes one row and column of $\mathbf{M}$. To keep $\mathbf{M}$ PD, we
constrain the Schur complement of sub-matrix $\mathbf{M}_{2,2}$ of $\mathbf{M}$

still remains a challenging problem. Most previously developed algorithms had
focused on fingertip grasp, failing to solve the problem even for fully
actuated hands/grippers during adaptive/wrapping type of grasps, where each
finger makes contact with object at several points. Kinematic closed form
solutions are not possible for such an articulated finger which simultaneously
reaches several given goal points. This paper, presents a framework for
computing best grasp for an underactuated robotic gripper, based on a novel
object slicing method. The proposed method quickly find contacts using an
object slicing technique and use grasp quality measure to find the best grasp
from a pool of grasps. To validate the proposed method, implementation has been
done on twenty-four household objects and toys using a two finger underactuated
robot gripper. Unlike the many other existing approaches, the proposed approach
has several advantages: it can handle objects with complex shapes and sizes; it
does not require simplifying the objects into primitive geometric shape; Most
importantly, it can be applied on point clouds taken using depth sensor; it
takes into account gripper kinematic constraints and generates feasible grasps
for both adaptive/enveloping and fingertip types of grasps.

an ideal platform to investigate Planck suppressed physics through their long
distance propagation. In this work, we intend to investigate CPT violation
through Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) in the long-baseline accelerator
based neutrino experiments. Considering the simplest four-dimensional Lorentz
violating parameters, for the first time, we obtain the sensitivity limits on
the LIV parameters from the currently running long-baseline experiments T2K and

violation sensitivities by considering NO$\nu$A as a case study. We find that
the sensitivity limits on LIV parameters obtained from T2K are much weaker than
that of NO$\nu$A and the synergy of T2K and NO$\nu$A can improve these
sensitivities. All these limits are slightly weaker ($2 \sigma$ level) compared
to the values extracted from Super-Kamiokande experiment with atmospheric
neutrinos. Moreover, we observe that the mass hierarchy and CPV sensitivities
are either enhanced or deteriorated significantly in the presence of LIV as
these sensitivities crucially depend on the new CP-violating phases. We also
present the correlation between $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$ and the LIV parameter

weak screening regime. In the attractive interaction case, the ground state is
either EI that breaks the translational symmetries (strong screening regime),

based on its perception of the environment, of itself and of its requirements.
To develop a self-adaptive system, software developers codify knowledge about
the system and its environment, as well as how adaptation actions impact on the
system. However, the codified knowledge may be insufficient due to design time
uncertainty, and thus a self-adaptive system may execute adaptation actions
that do not have the desired effect. Online learning is an emerging approach to
address design time uncertainty by employing machine learning at runtime.
Online learning accumulates knowledge at runtime by, for instance, exploring
not-yet executed adaptation actions. We address two specific problems with
respect to online learning for self-adaptive systems. First, the number of
possible adaptation actions can be very large. Existing online learning
techniques randomly explore the possible adaptation actions, but this can lead
to slow convergence of the learning process. Second, the possible adaptation
actions can change as a result of system evolution. Existing online learning
techniques are unaware of these changes and thus do not explore new adaptation
actions, but explore adaptation actions that are no longer valid. We propose
using feature models to give structure to the set of adaptation actions and
thereby guide the exploration process during online learning. Experimental
results involving four real-world systems suggest that considering the
hierarchical structure of feature models may speed up convergence by 7.2% on
average. Considering the differences between feature models before and after an
evolution step may speed up convergence by 64.6% on average. [...]

thermal equilibrium. The particles are confined by a harmonic trap and
repelling each other via pairwise interaction potential that behaves as a power
law $\propto \sum_{\substack{i\neq j}}^N|x_i-x_j|^{-k}$ (with $k>-2$) of their
mutual distance. This is a generalization of the well known cases of the one
component plasma ($k=-1$), Dyson's log-gas ($k\to 0^+$), and the Calogero-Moser
model ($k=2$). Due to the competition between harmonic confinement and pairwise
repulsion, the particles spread over a finite region of space for all $k>-2$.
We compute exactly the average density profile for large $N$ for all $k>-2$ and
show that while it is independent of temperature for sufficiently low
temperature, it has a rich and nontrivial dependence on $k$ with distinct
behavior for $-2<k<1$, $k>1$ and $k=1$.

  Facial Micro-Expression Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Facial Micro-Expressions (MEs) are spontaneous, involuntary facial movements
when a person experiences an emotion but deliberately or unconsciously attempts
to conceal his or her genuine emotions. Recently, ME recognition has attracted
increasing attention due to its potential applications such as clinical
diagnosis, business negotiation, interrogations, and security. However, it is
expensive to build large scale ME datasets, mainly due to the difficulty of
inducing spontaneous MEs. This limits the application of deep learning
techniques which require lots of training data. In this paper, we propose a
simple, efficient yet robust descriptor called Extended Local Binary Patterns
on Three Orthogonal Planes (ELBPTOP) for ME recognition. ELBPTOP consists of
three complementary binary descriptors: LBPTOP and two novel ones Radial
Difference LBPTOP (RDLBPTOP) and Angular Difference LBPTOP (ADLBPTOP), which
explore the local second order information along the radial and angular
directions contained in ME video sequences. ELBPTOP is a novel ME descriptor
inspired by unique and subtle facial movements. It is computationally efficient
and only marginally increases the cost of computing LBPTOP, yet is extremely
effective for ME recognition. In addition, by firstly introducing Whitened
Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) to ME recognition, we can further obtain
more compact and discriminative feature representations, then achieve
significantly computational savings. Extensive experimental evaluation on three
popular spontaneous ME datasets SMIC, CASME II and SAMM show that our proposed
ELBPTOP approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on all
three single evaluated datasets and achieves promising results on
cross-database recognition.Our code will be made available.

propagation of waves follows an iterative minimization of a misfit functional.
In marine seismic exploration, the observed data usually consist of
measurements of the pressure field but dual-sensor devices also provide the
normal velocity. Consequently, a reciprocity-based misfit functional is
specifically designed, and defines the Full Reciprocity-gap Waveform Inversion
(FRgWI ) method. This misfit functional provides additional features compared
to the more traditional least-squares approaches with, in particular, that the
observational and computational acquisitions can be different. Therefore, the
positions and wavelets of the sources from which the measurements are acquired
are not needed in the reconstruction procedure and, in fact, the numerical
acquisition (for the simulations) can be arbitrarily chosen. Based on
three-dimensional experiments, FRgWI is shown to behave better than Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) in the same context. Then, it allows for arbitrary
numerical acquisitions in two ways: when few measurements are given, a dense
numerical acquisition (compared to the observational one) can be used to
compensate. On the other hand, with a dense observational acquisition, a sparse
computational one is shown to be sufficient, for instance with multiple-point
sources, hence reducing the numerical cost. FRgWI displays accurate
reconstructions in both situations and appears more robust with respect to
cross-talk than the least-squares shot-stacking.

while the 12CO J=1-0 data were used to estimate mass-loss rates for the
complete sample. We have classified the sources into four groups according to
the different profiles and final gas expansion velocities. Type 1 and 2
profiles are broad and narrow symmetric lines, respectively. Type 3 profiles on
the contrary are strange profiles with very pronounced asymmetries. Finally,
type 4 profiles are those showing two different components: a narrow line
profile superimposed on a broad pedestal component. Interestingly, we report a
moderate correlation between mass-loss rates and 12CO J=1-0/J=2-1 line
intensity ratios for O-rich SRs, suggesting a different behaviour between C-
and O-rich SRs. Using SHAPE+shapemol, we find a unified simple model based on
an oblate spheroid placed in different orientations that may explain all the
12CO profiles in the sample, indicating that the gas expansion is in general
predominantly equatorial. Moreover, in order to explain the type 4 profiles, we
define an extra component which may somehow be a biconical structure or
similar. Type 1 and 2 profiles, curiously, may also be explained by standard
spherically symmetric envelopes. We conclude that most circumstellar shells

individual marine organisms, considerable debate exists over the nature and
impact of multiple simultaneous stressors on both individual species and marine
ecosystems. We describe a modelling tool (OSIRIS) for integrating the effects
of multiple simultaneous stressors. The model is relatively computationally
light, and demonstrated using a coarse-grained, non-spatial and simplified
representation of a temperate marine ecosystem. This version is capable of
reproducing a wide range of dynamic responses.Results indicate the degree to
which interactions are synergistic is crucial in determining sensitivity to
forcing, particularly for the higher trophic levels, which can respond
non-linearly to stronger forcing. Stronger synergistic interactions sensitize
the system to variability in forcing, and combinations of stronger forcing,
noise and synergies between effects are particularly potent. This work also
underlines the significant potential risk incurred in treating stressors on
ecosystems as individual and additive.

of bosonic operators, we construct such an observable that is invariant under
symplectic transformations (rotation and squeezing in phase space). We first
design a two-copy uncertainty observable, which is a discrete-spectrum operator
vanishing with certainty if and only if it is applied on (two copies of) any
pure Gaussian state centered at the origin. The non-negativity of its variance
translates into the Schr\""odinger-Robertson uncertainty relation. We then
extend our construction to a three-copy uncertainty observable, which exhibits
additional invariance under displacements (translations in phase space) so that
it vanishes on every pure Gaussian state. The resulting invariance under
Gaussian unitaries makes this observable a natural tool to measure the
phase-space uncertainty -- or the deviation from pure Gaussianity -- of
continuous-variable bosonic states. In particular, it suggests that the Shannon
entropy of this observable provides a symplectic-invariant entropic measure of
uncertainty in position and momentum phase space.

in ad hoc team problems, a model of many practical multiagent systems
applications. Prior work in multiagent learning has often been focussed on
homogeneous groups of agents, meaning that all agents were identical and a
priori aware of this fact. Also, those algorithms that are specifically
designed for ad hoc team problems are typically evaluated in teams of agents
with fixed behaviours, as opposed to agents which are adapting their
behaviours. In this work, we empirically evaluate five MAL algorithms,
representing major approaches to multiagent learning but originally developed
with the homogeneous setting in mind, to understand their behaviour in a set of
ad hoc team problems. All teams consist of agents which are continuously
adapting their behaviours. The algorithms are evaluated with respect to a
comprehensive characterisation of repeated matrix games, using performance
criteria that include considerations such as attainment of equilibrium, social
welfare and fairness. Our main conclusion is that there is no clear winner.
However, the comparative evaluation also highlights the relative strengths of
different algorithms with respect to the type of performance criteria, e.g.,
social welfare vs. attainment of equilibrium.

FCN with an end-to-end learning-based approach and constructed by newly
designed dense blocks including a dense fully-connected layer, the proposed
FD-FCN is different from other FCN-based methods and leads to an outperformance
in the perspective of both efficiency and accuracy. Compared with the U-shaped
architecture, FD-FCN discards the upsampling path for model fitness. To
alleviate the problem of parameter explosion, the inputs of dense blocks are no
longer directly passed to subsequent layers. This architecture of FD-FCN brings
a great reduction on both memory and time consumption in training process.
Although FD-FCN is slimmed down, in model competence it gains better capability
of dense inference than other conventional networks. This benefits from the
construction of network architecture and the incorporation of redesigned dense
blocks. The multi-scale FD-FCN models both local and global context by
embedding intermediate-layer outputs in the final prediction, which encourages
consistency between features extracted at different scales and embeds
fine-grained information directly in the segmentation process. In addition,
dense blocks are rebuilt to enlarge the receptive fields without significantly
increasing parameters, and spectral coordinates are exploited for spatial
context of the original input patch. The experiments were performed over the
IBSR dataset, and FD-FCN produced an accurate segmentation result of overall
Dice overlap value of 89.81% for 11 brain structures in 53 seconds, with at

exchange for karma, which will make it easier for them to claim the resource
use in the future. To understand whether such a system might work robustly, we
only design the protocol and not the agents' policies. We take a game-theoretic

technology. What was once a technology used to solve digital transaction issues
turns out to have some wider usage, including smart contract. The development
of smart contract can be traced from the numerous platforms facilitating it,
however the issue on how well each platform works as oppose to each other has
yet been fully explored. The usage of smart contract can be seen from the
applications that are built on top of the smart contract platform, such as the
tokenization of real world to virtual world assets. However smart contract
contains several issues concerning security and codifying which could be solved
by various tools that are proposed by existing research. This paper aims to
revisit the blockchain-based smart contract technology in order to understand
and discuss the research gaps gathered from existing research and to provide

research and exciting avenue for a long standing problem in medical imaging.
The goal is to learn a complex function that maps the appearance of input image
pairs to parameters of a spatial transformation in order to align corresponding
anatomical structures. We argue and show that the current direct, non-iterative
approaches are sub-optimal, in particular if we seek accurate alignment of
Structures-of-Interest (SoI). Information about SoI is often available at
training time, for example, in form of segmentations or landmarks. We introduce
a novel, generic framework, Image-and-Spatial Transformer Networks (ISTNs), to
leverage SoI information allowing us to learn new image representations that
are optimised for the downstream registration task. Thanks to these
representations we can employ a test-specific, iterative refinement over the
transformation parameters which yields highly accurate registration even with
very limited training data. Performance is demonstrated on pairwise 3D brain
registration and illustrative synthetic data.

extremely high consequences. Close monitoring for early detection of abnormal
system conditions is therefore required. Data-driven solutions to this problem
have been limited for two reasons: First, safety critical assets are designed
and maintained to be highly reliable and faults are rare. Fault detection can
thus not be solved with supervised learning. Second, complex industrial systems
usually have long lifetime during which they face very different operating
conditions. In the early life of the system, the collected data is probably not
representative of future operating conditions, making it challenging to train a
robust model.
  In this paper, we propose a methodology to monitor the systems in their early
life. To do so, we enhance the training dataset with other units from a fleet,
for which longer observations are available. Since each unit has its own
specificity, we propose to extract features made independent of their origin by
three unsupervised feature alignment techniques. First, using a variational
encoder, we impose a shared probabilistic encoder/decoder for both units.
Second, we introduce a new loss designed to conserve inter-point spacial
relationships between the input and the learned features. Last, we propose to
train in an adversarial manner a discriminator on the origin of the features.
Once aligned, the features are fed to a one-class classifier to monitor the
health of the system. By exploring the different combinations of the proposed
alignment strategies, and by testing them on a real case study, a fleet
composed of 112 power plants operated in different geographical locations and
under very different operating regimes, we demonstrate that this alignment is
necessary and beneficial.

established an unsupervised learning method combining the VAE and a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM), where the dimensions of the observed spectral data are
reduced by the VAE, and clustering in feature space is performed by the GMM. We
found that some characteristic spatial structures, such as the iron knot on the
eastern rim, can be automatically recognised by this method, which uses only
spectral properties. This result shows that unsupervised machine learning can
be useful for extracting characteristic spatial structures from spectral
information in observational data (without detailed spectral analysis), which
would reduce human-intensive preprocessing costs for understanding fine
structures in diffuse astronomical objects, e.g., SNRs or clusters of galaxies.
Such data-driven analysis can be used to select regions from which to extract
spectra for detailed analysis and help us make the best use of the large amount
of spectral data available currently and arriving in the coming decades.

Usually, the various Service Function Chains (SFCs) belonging to a slice are

Provider (InP) will be able to allocate enough resources to cope with the
increasing demands of some SP. Moreover, in many situations, slices have to be
deployed over some geographical area: coverage as well as minimum per-user rate
constraints have then to be taken into account. This paper takes the InP
perspective and proposes a slice resource provisioning approach to cope with
multiple slice demands in terms of computing, storage, coverage, and rate

aggregated within a graph of Slice Resource Demands (SRD). Infrastructure nodes
and links have then to be provisioned so as to satisfy all SRDs. This problem
leads to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation. A two-step approach is
considered, with several variants, depending on whether the constraints of each
slice to be provisioned are taken into account sequentially or jointly. Once
provisioning has been performed, any slice deployment strategy may be
considered on the reduced-size infrastructure graph on which resources have
been provisioned. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the

first normalized to exclude the effect of external factors (i.e., scale factor

  Relaxing these notions further we introduce generalized profitable strategies

no-arbitrage there may exist generalized gain strategies yielding positive
gains on average under the specified scenarios.
  In the first part of the paper we characterize these generalized statistical
no-arbitrage notions. In the second part of the paper we construct several
profitable generalized strategies with respect to various choices of the

binomial strategies and follow-the-trend strategies as well as partition-type
strategies. We study and compare their behaviour on simulated data.

observations in comparison to the standard Einstein theory. Recently, there has
been a debate about the equivalence of Rastall gravity and general relativity.
Motivated by this open issue, in the present work, we attempt to shed some
light on this debate by analyzing the evolution of the Rastall based
cosmological model at the background as well as perturbation level. Employing
the dynamical system techniques, we found that at late times, the dynamics of
the model resembles the $\Lambda$CDM model at the background level irrespective
of the choice of Rastall's parameter. However, at the perturbation level, we
found that the evolution of the growth index heavily depends on the Rastall's
parameter and displays a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model.

specifically, the neural network performs as a function node in the modified

modify the updating rule in the conventional sum-product algorithm so that the

atmosphere and inferred from the emission in supernova remnants (SNRs), appear
to be significantly steeper than the ""standard"" diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) theory predicts. Although the reconstruction of the primary spectra
introduces an additional steepening due to propagation effects, there is a
growing consensus in the CR community that these corrections fall short to
explain the newest high-precision data. Using 2D hybrid simulations, we
investigate a new mechanism that may steepen the spectrum during the
acceleration in SNR shocks.
  Most of the DSA treatments are limited to homogeneous shock environments. To
investigate whether inhomogeneity effects can produce the necessary extra
steepening, we assume that the magnetic field changes its angle along the shock
front. The rationale behind this approach is the strong dependence of the DSA
efficiency upon the field angle, $\theta_\mathrm{Bn}$. Our results show that
the variation of shock obliquity along its face results in a noticeable
steepening of the DSA spectrum. Compared to simulations of quasi-parallel
shocks, we observe an increase of the spectral index by $\Delta q=0.1-0.15$.
Possible extrapolation of the limited simulation results to more realistic SNR
conditions are briefly considered.

applications is difficult if not impossible, atoms provide stable quantum
systems which, for the same species and isotope, are all identical. Whilst
atomic ground-states provide scalable quantum objects, their applications are
limited by the range over which their properties can be varied. In contrast,
Rydberg atoms offer strong and controllable atomic interactions that can be
tuned by selecting states with different principal quantum number or orbital
angular momentum. In addition Rydberg atoms are comparatively long-lived, and
the large number of available energy levels and their separations allow
coupling to electromagnetic fields spanning over 6 orders of magnitude in
frequency. These features make Rydberg atoms highly desirable for developing
new quantum technologies. After giving a brief introduction to how the
properties of Rydberg atoms can be tuned, we give several examples of current
areas where the unique advantages of Rydberg atom systems are being exploited

theory. In this sense, quantum information theory is underdeveloped similarly
to how quantum physics was underdeveloped before Erwin Schrodinger introduced
his famous equation for the evolution of a quantum wave function. In this
review article, we cope with the problem of time for one of the central
quantities in quantum information theory: entropy. Recently, a replica trick
formalism, the so-called 'multiple parallel world' formalism, has been proposed
that revolutionizes entropy evaluation for quantum systems. This formalism is
one of the first attempts to introduce 'time evolution' in quantum information
theory. With the total entropy being conserved in a closed system, entropy can
flow internally between subsystems; however, we show that this flow is not
limited only to physical correlations as the literature suggest. The nonlinear
dependence of entropy on the density matrix introduces new types of
correlations with no analogue in physical quantities. Evolving a number of
replicas simultaneously makes it possible for them to exchange particles
between different replicas. We will summarize some of the recent news about
entropy in some example quantum devices. Moreover, we take a quick look at a
new correspondence that was recently proposed that provides an interesting link
between quantum information theory and quantum physics. The mere existence of
such a correspondence allows for exploring new physical phenomena as the result
of controlling entanglement in a quantum device.

involved, the spectra are never monosignate, as is often observed in resonance
Raman optical activity spectra. Most normal modes are enhanced through these

molecular origins of the Raman optical activity intensity for selected normal

version of the variation norm has a long history, starting with Total Variation
Denoising (Rudin et al., 1992), and has been considered by several recent
articles, in particular Fang et al., 2019 and van der Laan, 2015. In this
article, we consider empirical risk minimization over the class $\mathcal{F}_d$
of c\`adl\`ag functions over $[0,1]^d$ with bounded sectional variation norm
(also called Hardy-Krause variation).
  We show how a certain representation of functions in $\mathcal{F}_d$ allows
to bound the bracketing entropy of sieves of $\mathcal{F}_d$, and therefore
derive rates of convergence in nonparametric function estimation. Specifically,
for sieves whose growth is controlled by some rate $a_n$, we show that the
empirical risk minimizer has rate of convergence $O_P(n^{-1/3} (\log
n)^{2(d-1)/3} a_n)$. Remarkably, the dimension only affects the rate in $n$
through the logarithmic factor, making this method especially appropriate for
high dimensional problems.
  In particular, we show that in the case of nonparametric regression over
sieves of c\`adl\`ag functions with bounded sectional variation norm, this
upper bound on the rate of convergence holds for least-squares estimators,
under the random design, sub-exponential errors setting.

the many proposals in the literature. On the other hand, G91 may suffer from a
kind of self-supported, unfounded derivations when epistemic cycles come into

property of epistemic semantics called foundedness. Moreover, a first semantics
proved to satisfy foundedness was also proposed, the so-called Founded
Autoepistemic Equilibrium Logic (FAEEL). In this paper, we prove that FAEEL
also satisfies the epistemic splitting property something that, together with
foundedness, was not fulfilled by any other approach up to date. To prove this
result, we provide an alternative characterisation of FAEEL as a combination of
G91 with a simpler logic we called Founded Epistemic Equilibrium Logic (FEEL),
which is somehow an extrapolation of the stable model semantics to the modal

reverberant and noisy acoustic environments. Dereverberation and noise
reduction algorithms typically require several model parameters, e.g. the
speech, reverberation and noise power spectral densities (PSDs). A commonly
used assumption is that the noise PSD matrix is known. However, in practical
acoustic scenarios, the noise PSD matrix is unknown and should be estimated
along with the speech and reverberation PSDs. In this paper, we consider the
case of rank-deficient noise PSD matrix, which arises when the noise signal
consists of multiple directional interference sources, whose number is less
than the number of microphones. We derive two closed-form maximum likelihood
estimators (MLEs). The first is a non-blocking-based estimator which jointly
estimates the speech, reverberation and noise PSDs, and the second is a
blocking-based estimator, which first blocks the speech signal and then jointly
estimates the reverberation and noise PSDs. Both estimators are analytically
compared and analyzed, and mean square errors (MSEs) expressions are derived.
Furthermore, Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRBs) on the estimated PSDs are derived. The
proposed estimators are examined using both simulation and real reverberant and
noisy signals, demonstrating the advantage of the proposed method compared to
competing estimators.

The SSTs are spread across the four square kilometres of the array to detect
the rare, but bright, Cherenkov showers produced by the highest-energy gamma
rays. One proposed camera design for the SSTs is the Compact High Energy Camera
(CHEC). Its compact and curved focal plane design is tailored for dual-mirror
Schwarzschild-Couder telescopes, making it compatible with two of the three
telescope proposals for the SSTs. The latest design of CHEC (known as CHEC-S)
utilises silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs); an attractive alternative to
traditional photomultiplier tubes, offering improved photon detection
efficiency and photoelectron counting resolution for a large dynamic range,
across tightly-packed pixels. However, SiPMs suffer from the phenomena of
optical crosstalk, which degrades the ability to resolve the number of photons
incident on the photosensor. CHEC-S also features full-waveform readout at
nanosecond sampling resolution with a flexible trigger scheme. This is
facilitated by the TARGET (TeV Array Read-out with GSa/s sampling and Event

and technical design of CHEC-S and displays the key performance results,
matched against the criteria required for a CTA camera. The limitation caused
by the optical crosstalk of the SiPM is highlighted, and the expected
performance with more recent iterations of the photosensor technology is also

examined in this paper for two-qubit pure entangled states in terms of
different entanglement measures like Negativity (N), Logarithmic Negativity
(LN), and Entanglement of Formation (EOF). Although these entanglement measures
are defined differently, to what extent they differ in quantitatively
addressing the earlier mentioned question has remained uninvestigated.
Theoretical estimate in this paper shows that an appropriately defined
parameter characterizing the fractional deviation of any given entangled state
from the maximally entangled state in terms of N is quite different from that
computed in terms of EOF with their values differing up to ~ 15 % for states
further away from the maximally entangled state. Similarly, the values of such
fractional deviation parameters estimated using the entanglement measures LN
and EOF, respectively, also strikingly differ among themselves with the maximum
value of this difference being around 23 %. This analysis is complemented by
illustration of these differences in terms of empirical results obtained from a
suitably planned experimental study. Thus, such appreciable amount of
quantitative non-equivalence between the entanglement measures in addressing
the experimentally relevant question considered in the present paper highlights
the requirement of an appropriate quantifier for such intent. We indicate
directions of study that can be explored towards finding such a quantifier.

and theoretical neuroscience over the past two decades. However, some important
questions still remain: (i) What is the critical point the brain operates at?
(ii) What is the regulatory mechanism that brings about and maintains such a
critical state? (iii) The critical state is characterized by scale-invariant
behavior which is seemingly at odds with definitive brain oscillations? In this
work we consider a biologically motivated model of Izhikevich neuronal network
with chemical synapses interacting via spike-timingdependent plasticity (STDP)
as well as axonal time delay. Under generic and physiologically relevant
conditions we show that the system is organized and maintained around a
synchronization transition point as opposed to an activity transition point
associated with an absorbing state phase transition. However, such a state
exhibits experimentally relevant signs of critical dynamics including
scale-free avalanches with finite-size scaling as well as branching ratios.
While the system displays stochastic oscillations with highly correlated
fluctuations, it also displays dominant frequency modes seen as sharp peaks in
the power spectrum. The role of STDP as well as time delay is crucial in
achieving and maintaining such critical dynamics, while the role of inhibition
is not as crucial. In this way we provide definitive answers to all three
questions posed above. We also show that one can achieve supercritical or
subcritical dynamics if one changes the average time delay associated with
axonal conduction.

models of computation studied in automata theory. Their conceptual extension is
the non-deterministic finite automata which also have plenty of applications.
In this article, we study these models through the lens of succinct data
structures where our ultimate goal is to encode these mathematical objects
using information-theoretically optimal number of bits along with supporting
queries on them efficiently. Towards this goal, we first design a succinct data
structure for representing any deterministic finite automaton $\mathcal{D}$
having $n$ states over a $\sigma$-letter alphabet $\Sigma$ using $(\sigma-1)
n\log n + O(n \log \sigma)$ bits of space, which can determine, given an input
string $x$ over $\Sigma$, whether $\mathcal{D}$ accepts $x$ in $O(|x| \log
\sigma)$ time, using constant words of working space. When the input
deterministic finite automaton is acyclic, not only we can improve the above
space-bound significantly to $(\sigma -1) (n-1)\log n+ 3n + O(\log^2 \sigma) +
o(n)$ bits, we also obtain optimal query time for string acceptance checking.
More specifically, using our succinct representation, we can check if a given
input string $x$ can be accepted by the acyclic deterministic finite automaton
using time proportional to the length of $x$, hence, the optimal query time. We
also exhibit a succinct data structure for representing a non-deterministic
finite automaton $\mathcal{N}$ having $n$ states over a $\sigma$-letter
alphabet $\Sigma$ using $\sigma n^2+n$ bits of space, such that given an input
string $x$, we can decide whether $\mathcal{N}$ accepts $x$ efficiently in
$O(n^2|x|)$ time. Finally, we also provide time and space-efficient algorithms
for performing several standard operations such as union, intersection, and
complement on the languages accepted by deterministic finite automata.

intelligence (AI). Situations involving multiple decision makers are
particularly complex, leading to computational intractability of principled
solution methods. A body of work in AI has tried to mitigate this problem by
trying to distill interaction to its essence: how does the policy of one agent
influence another agent? If we can find more compact representations of such
influence, this can help us deal with the complexity, for instance by searching
the space of influences rather than the space of policies. However, so far
these notions of influence have been restricted in their applicability to
special cases of interaction. In this paper we formalize influence-based
abstraction (IBA), which facilitates the elimination of latent state factors
without any loss in value, for a very general class of problems described as
factored partially observable stochastic games (fPOSGs). On the one hand, this
generalizes existing descriptions of influence, and thus can serve as the
foundation for improvements in scalability and other insights in decision
making in complex multiagent settings. On the other hand, since the presence of
other agents can be seen as a generalization of single agent settings, our
formulation of IBA also provides a sufficient statistic for decision making
under abstraction for a single agent. We also give a detailed discussion of the
relations to such previous works, identifying new insights and interpretations
of these approaches. In these ways, this paper deepens our understanding of
abstraction in a wide range of sequential decision making settings, providing
the basis for new approaches and algorithms for a large class of problems.

electroencephalogram during NREM sleep. These events can be classified in three
groups (A1, A2 and A3) according to their spectral contents, and are thought to
play a role in the transitions between the different sleep stages. A-phase
detection and classification is usually performed manually by a trained expert,
but it is a tedious and time-consuming task. In the past two decades, various
researchers have designed algorithms to automatically detect and classify the
A-phases with varying degrees of success, but the problem remains open. In this
paper, a different approach is proposed: instead of attempting to design a
general classifier for all subjects, we propose to train ad-hoc classifiers for
each subject using as little data as possible, in order to drastically reduce
the amount of time required from the expert. The proposed classifiers are based
on deep convolutional neural networks using the log-spectrogram of the EEG
signal as input data. Results are encouraging, achieving average accuracies of
80.31% when discriminating between A-phases and non A-phases, and 71.87% when
classifying among A-phase sub-types, with only 25% of the total A-phases used
for training. When additional expert-validated data is considered, the sub-type
classification accuracy increases to 78.92%. These results show that a
semi-automatic annotation system with assistance from an expert could provide a
better alternative to fully automatic classifiers.

method to solve reinforcement learning tasks is Neuroevolution, where neural
networks are optimized by evolutionary algorithms. A disadvantage of
Neuroevolution is that it can require numerous function evaluations, while not
fully utilizing the available information from each fitness evaluation. This is
especially problematic when fitness evaluations become expensive. To reduce the
cost of fitness evaluations, surrogate models can be employed to partially
replace the fitness function. The difficulty of surrogate modeling for
Neuroevolution is the complex search space and how to compare different
networks. To that end, recent studies showed that a kernel based approach,
particular with phenotypic distance measures, works well. These kernels compare
different networks via their behavior (phenotype) rather than their topology or
encoding (genotype). In this work, we discuss the use of surrogate model-based
Neuroevolution (SMB-NE) using a phenotypic distance for reinforcement learning.
In detail, we investigate a) the potential of SMB-NE with respect to evaluation
efficiency and b) how to select adequate input sets for the phenotypic distance
measure in a reinforcement learning problem. The results indicate that we are
able to considerably increase the evaluation efficiency using dynamic input
sets.

where in a viscous disc convergent migration will form a long-term stable

particular, if planets are massive enough to significantly perturb the disc
surface density and drive vortex formation, the smooth capture of planets into
mean motion resonances is disrupted. As planets pile up in close orbits, not
protected by resonances, close encounters increase the probability of
planet-planet collisions, even while the gas disc is still present. While
inviscid discs often produce unstable non-resonant systems, stable, closely

universal scaling properties near the unjamming point, most notably the
vanishing of the shear-to-bulk moduli ratio $G/B$ upon decompression.
Interestingly, the smallness of $G/B$ stems from the large nonaffinity of
deformation-induced displacements under shear strains, compared to
insignificant nonaffinity of displacements under compressive strains. In this
work we show using numerical simulations that the relative weights of the
affine and nonaffine contributions to the bulk modulus, and their dependence on
the proximity to the unjamming point, can qualitatively differ between
different models that feature the same generic unjamming phenomenology. In
canonical models of unjamming we observe that the ratio of the nonaffine to
total bulk moduli $B_{na}/B$ approaches a constant upon decompression, while in
other, less well-studied models, it vanishes. We show that the vanishing of
$B_{na}/B$ in non-canonical models stems from the emergence of an invariance of
net (zero) forces on the constituent particles to compressive strains at the
onset of unjamming. We provide a theoretical scaling analysis that fully
explains our numerical observations, and allows to predict the scaling behavior
of $B_{na}/B$ upon unjamming, given the functional form of the pairwise

address the issue of reliable scheduling of V2V transmissions out of coverage,
we propose Vehicular Reinforcement Learning Scheduler (VRLS), a centralized
scheduler that predictively assigns the resources for V2V communication while
the vehicle is still in cellular network coverage. VRLS is a unified
reinforcement learning (RL) solution, wherein the learning agent, the state
representation, and the reward provided to the agent are applicable to
different vehicular environments of interest (in terms of vehicular density,
resource configuration, and wireless channel conditions). Such a unified
solution eliminates the necessity of redesigning the RL components for a
different environment, and facilitates transfer learning from one to another
similar environment. We evaluate the performance of VRLS and show its ability
to avoid collisions and half-duplex errors, and to reuse the resources better
than the state of the art scheduling algorithms. We also show that pre-trained
VRLS agent can adapt to different V2V environments with limited retraining,
thus enabling real-world deployment in different scenarios.

waves by a system of conservation laws for the parameters of modulated periodic
traveling waves. Here, admissible, discontinuous, weak solutions of the Whitham
modulation equations--termed Whitham shocks--are identified with zero
dispersion limits of traveling wave solutions to higher order dispersive
partial differential equations (PDEs). The far-field behavior of the traveling
wave solutions satisfies the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. Generally, the
numerically computed traveling waves represent heteroclinic connections between
two periodic orbits of an ordinary differential equation. The focus here is on
the fifth order Korteweg-de Vries equation. The three admissible one-parameter
families of Whitham shocks are used as solution components for the generalized
Riemann problem of the Whitham modulation equations. Admissible KdV5-Whitham
shocks are generally undercompressive, i.e., all characteristic families pass
through the shock. The heteroclinic traveling waves that limit to admissible
Whitham shocks are found to be ubiquitous in numerical simulations of smoothed
step initial conditions for other higher order dispersive equations including
the Kawahara equation (with third and fifth order dispersion) and a nonlocal
model of weakly nonlinear gravity-capillary waves with full dispersion. Whitham
shocks are linked to recent studies of nonlinear higher order dispersive waves
in optics and ultracold atomic gases. The approach presented here provides a
novel method for constructing new traveling wave solutions to dispersive
nonlinear wave equations and a framework to identify physically relevant,
admissible shock solutions of the Whitham modulation equations.

often count the fixed points of elements of a cyclic group acting on a

set. One of the most impressive instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon is a
theorem of Rhoades asserting that the set of plane partitions in a rectangular
box under the action of promotion exhibits cyclic sieving. In Rhoades's result
the sieving polynomial is the size generating function for these plane
partitions, which has a well-known product formula due to MacMahon. We extend
Rhoades's result by also considering symmetries of plane partitions:
specifically, complementation and transposition. The relevant polynomial here
is the size generating function for symmetric plane partitions, whose product
formula was conjectured by MacMahon and proved by Andrews and Macdonald.
Finally, we explain how these symmetry results also apply to the rowmotion
operator on plane partitions, which is closely related to promotion.

is wrong in general, since the classical Maxwell theory contains subtle

the dual symmetry between electric and magnetic components. We investigate
other manifestations of Abraham forces and torques and estimate orders of
magnitude, e.g related to chiral, moving or rotating matter. Some of them are
also severely violating dual symmetry. We provide a quantum description of the

generating giant van Hove singularity at the bottom of the band is considered,
while the Fermi level $E_{\rm f}$ is in the vinicity of the band bottom. To
compare MCE within MFA and DMFT temperature dependence of magnetization, total
energy and finally entropy for a set of Coulomb interactions $U$ at zero and
finite values of magnetic field $h$ for both methods were performed. Also one
of the MCE potentials, isothermal entropy change, as a function of temperature
$\Delta S (T)$ for both MFA and DMFT is calculated. In the MFA, the expected
maximum value of $\Delta S (T)$ at the Curie temperature $T_C$ ($\Delta S_{\rm
max}$) quite significantly decreases while $U$ grows. Similar but much weaker
decreasing of $\Delta S_{\rm max}$ is found for DMFT results. The account of
local quantum fluctuations results in larger values of $\Delta S_{\rm max}$
within DMFT than within MFA. A peak width of $\Delta S (T)$ at half height is
approximately the same for both methods. Another effect of DMFT local quantum
fluctuations is the destruction of anomalous Curie temperature $T_C$ dependence
on $U$ present in MFA, which is invoked by an effect of giant van Hove
singularity. However the relative cooling power (RCP) is very close in DMFT and
MFA for the same model parameters and goes down upon $U$ increase.

clear pathways that phonons can utilize during transport, plays the most
crucial role in reducing the thermal conductivity in nanoporous materials,

log(Re)-log(M*) planes the distribution of GCs is along the sequence defined by
the brightest and massive early-type galaxies (BCGs). The Illustris simulation
reproduces the tails of the massive galaxies visible both in the

estimate of the effective radii of the dwarf galaxies that appear too large and

reveal the complex evolutionary paths of galaxies in the SRs and indicate that
the line marking the Zone of Exclusion (ZoE), visible both in the

gas (HM2DEG) is established. The layer thickness fluctuation studied by atomic
force microscopy, x-ray scattering, and spatially resolved cathodoluminescence
spectroscopy occurs on two different lateral length scales. On the shorter
length scale of about 0.01~$\mu$m, we found from atomic force micrographs and
the broadening of the satellite maxima in x-ray diffraction curves a very small
value of the mean square roughness of 0.1~nm. However, on a longer length scale
of about 1.0~$\mu$m, step bunching during epitaxial growth resulted in layer
thickness inhomogeneities of up to 2~nm. The resulting fluctuation of the
strain in the micro-tubes leads to a local variation of the chemical potential,
which results in the fluctuation of the carrier density as well. This leads to
a phase cancelation of the Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations in the curved HM2DEG
and a reduction of the single-electron scattering time, while the electron
mobility in the structures remains high. The estimated fluctuation of the
carrier density agrees well with the energy fluctuation measured in the
cathodoluminescence spectra of the free-electron transition of the quantum
well.

to generate and visualize high-fidelity 3D / 4D organ geometric models from

reconstruction requires near hundreds of projections, which cost insufferable
computational time and deliver undesirable high imaging / radiation dose to
human subjects. Moreover, it always needs further notorious processes to
extract the accurate 3D organ models subsequently. To our knowledge, there is
no method directly and explicitly reconstructing multiple 3D organ meshes from
a single 2D medical grayscale image on the fly. Given single-view 2D medical
images, e.g., 3D / 4D-CT projections or X-ray images, our end-to-end
DeepOrganNet framework can efficiently and effectively reconstruct 3D / 4D lung
models with a variety of geometric shapes by learning the smooth deformation
fields from multiple templates based on a trivariate tensor-product deformation
technique, leveraging an informative latent descriptor extracted from input 2D
images. The proposed method can guarantee to generate high-quality and
high-fidelity manifold meshes for 3D / 4D lung models. The major contributions
of this work are to accurately reconstruct the 3D organ shapes from 2D
single-view projection, significantly improve the procedure time to allow
on-the-fly visualization, and dramatically reduce the imaging dose for human
subjects. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional
reconstruction method and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using
extensive 3D and 4D examples from synthetic phantom and real patient datasets.
The proposed method only needs several milliseconds to generate organ meshes
with 10K vertices, which has a great potential to be used in real-time image
guided radiation therapy (IGRT).

may retain eccentric orbits ($e>0.1$ at 10 Hz) detectable by ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors. Eccentricity can therefore be used to
differentiate dynamically-formed binaries from isolated binary black hole
mergers. Current template-based gravitational-wave searches do not use waveform
models associated to eccentric orbits, rendering the search less efficient to
eccentric binary systems. Here we present results of a search for binary black
hole mergers that inspiral in eccentric orbits using data from the first and
second observing runs (O1 and O2) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. The
search uses minimal assumptions on the morphology of the transient
gravitational waveform. We show that it is sensitive to binary mergers with a
detection range that is weakly dependent on eccentricity for all bound systems.
Our search did not identify any new binary merger candidates. We interpret
these results in light of eccentric binary formation models.

  measurements using unitary transformations",,,,,"quant-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Variational Quantum Eigensolver approach to the electronic structure
problem on a quantum computer involves measurement of the Hamiltonian
expectation value. Formally, quantum mechanics allows one to measure all
mutually commuting or compatible operators simultaneously. Unfortunately, the
current hardware permits measuring only a much more limited subset of operators
that share a common tensor product eigen-basis. We introduce unitary
transformations that transform any fully commuting group of operators to a
group that can be measured on current hardware. These unitary operations can be
encoded as a sequence of Clifford gates and let us not only measure much larger
groups of terms but also to obtain these groups efficiently on a classical
computer. The problem of finding the minimum number of fully commuting groups
of terms covering the whole Hamiltonian is found to be equivalent to the
minimum clique cover problem for a graph representing Hamiltonian terms as
vertices and commutativity between them as edges. Tested on few molecular
electronic Hamiltonians with up to 50 thousand terms, the introduced technique
allows for the reduction of the number of separately measurable operator groups
down to few hundreds, thus achieving up to 2 orders of magnitude reduction. It
was also shown that this gain scales at least linearly with the number of
qubits.

vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which attack DRL models by adding small
perturbations to the observations. However, some attacks assume full
availability of the victim model, and some require a huge amount of
computation, making them less feasible for real world applications. In this
work, we make further explorations of the vulnerabilities of DRL by studying
other aspects of attacks on DRL using realistic and efficient attacks. First,
we adapt and propose efficient black-box attacks when we do not have access to
DRL model parameters. Second, to address the high computational demands of
existing attacks, we introduce efficient online sequential attacks that exploit
temporal consistency across consecutive steps. Third, we explore the
possibility of an attacker perturbing other aspects in the DRL setting, such as
the environment dynamics. Finally, to account for imperfections in how an
attacker would inject perturbations in the physical world, we devise a method
for generating a robust physical perturbations to be printed. The attack is
evaluated on a real-world robot under various conditions. We conduct extensive
experiments both in simulation such as Atari games, robotics and autonomous
driving, and on real-world robotics, to compare the effectiveness of the
proposed attacks with baseline approaches. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to apply adversarial attacks on DRL systems to physical robots.

probabilities (such as the probability of picking a red marble from a bag with
an unknown distribution of coloured marbles). The most widespread model for
such situations of 'radical uncertainty' is in terms of imprecise
probabilities, i.e. representing the agent's knowledge as a set of probability
measures. We add to this model a plausibility map, associating to each measure
a plausibility number, as a way to go beyond what is known with certainty and
represent the agent's beliefs about probability. There are a number of standard
examples: Shannon Entropy, Centre of Mass etc. We then consider learning of two
types of information: (1) learning by repeated sampling from the unknown
distribution (e.g. picking marbles from the bag); and (2) learning higher-order
information about the distribution (in the shape of linear inequalities, e.g.
we are told there are more red marbles than green marbles). The first changes
only the plausibility map (via a 'plausibilistic' version of Bayes' Rule), but
leaves the given set of measures unchanged; the second shrinks the set of
measures, without changing their plausibility. Beliefs are defined as in Belief
Revision Theory, in terms of truth in the most plausible worlds. But our belief
change does not comply with standard AGM axioms, since the revision induced by
(1) is of a non-AGM type. This is essential, as it allows our agents to learn
the true probability: we prove that the beliefs obtained by repeated sampling
converge almost surely to the correct belief (in the true probability). We end
by sketching the contours of a dynamic doxastic logic for statistical learning.

Given the most
common definition of observables (having weakly vanishing Poisson bracket with
each first-class constraint), observables are constants of the motion and
nonlocal. Unfortunately this definition also implies that the observables for
massive electromagnetism with gauge freedom (Stueckelberg) are inequivalent to
those of massive electromagnetism without gauge freedom (Proca). The
alternative Pons-Salisbury-Sundermeyer definition of observables, aiming for
Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence, uses the gauge generator G, a tuned sum of
first-class constraints, rather than each first-class constraint separately,
and implies equivalent observables for equivalent massive electromagnetisms.
For General Relativity, G generates 4-dimensional Lie derivatives for
solutions. The Lie derivative compares different space-time points with the
same coordinate value in different coordinate systems, like 1 a.m. summer time
vs. 1 a.m. standard time, so a vanishing Lie derivative implies constancy
rather than covariance. Requiring equivalent observables for equivalent
formulations of massive gravity confirms that $G$ must generate the
$4$-dimensional Lie derivative (not $0$) for observables. These separate
results indicate that observables are invariant under internal gauge symmetries
but covariant under external gauge symmetries, but can this bifurcated
definition work for mixed theories such as Einstein-Maxwell theory? Pons,
Salisbury and Shepley have studied $G$ for Einstein-Yang-Mills. For
Einstein-Maxwell, both $F_{\mu\nu}$ and $g_{\mu\nu}$ are invariant under
electromagnetic gauge transformations and covariant (changing by a Lie
derivative) under $4$-dimensional coordinate transformations. Using the
bifurcated definition, these quantities count as observables, as one would
expect on non-Hamiltonian grounds.

that suffer life-limiting illnesses. These programs aim to guarantee a minimum

based on clinical evaluation of risk of one-year mortality.
  Objectives: The main objective of this work is to develop and validate
machine-learning based models to predict the exitus of a patient within the
next year using data gathered at hospital admission.
  Methods: Five machine learning techniques were applied in our study to
develop machine-learning predictive models: Support Vector Machines,
K-neighbors Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest and
Multilayer Perceptron. All models were trained and evaluated using the
retrospective dataset. The evaluation was performed with five metrics computed
by a resampling strategy: Accuracy, the area under the ROC curve, Specificity,
Sensitivity, and the Balanced Error Rate.
  Results: All models for forecasting one-year mortality achieved an AUC ROC
from 0.858 to 0.911. Specifically, Gradient Boosting Classifier was the best
model, producing an AUC ROC of 0.911 (CI 95%, 0.911 to 0.912), a sensitivity of
0.858 (CI 95%, 0.856 to 0.86) and a specificity of 0.807 (CI 95%, 0.806 to

  Conclusions: The analysis of common information at hospital admission
combined with machine learning techniques produced models with competitive
discriminative power. Our models reach the best results reported in state of
the art. These results demonstrate that they can be used as an accurate
data-driven palliative care criteria inclusion.

precious information about the mechanisms, modes and time scales of the
assembly of cosmic structures. Yet, the nucleogenesis and chemical evolution of
elements heavier than helium are dictated mostly by the physics of the stars
and the shape of the stellar mass spectrum. In particular, estimates of CNO
isotopic abundances in the hot, dusty media of high-redshift starburst galaxies
offer a unique glimpse into the shape of the stellar initial mass function
(IMF) in extreme environments that can not be accessed with direct observations
(star counts). Underlying uncertainties in stellar evolution and
nucleosynthesis theory, however, may hurt our chances of getting a firm grasp
of the IMF in these galaxies. In this work, we adopt new yields for massive
stars, covering different initial rotational velocities. First, we implement
the new yield set in a well-tested chemical evolution model for the Milky Way.
The calibrated model is then adapted to the specific case of a prototype
submillimeter galaxy (SMG). We show that, if the formation of fast-rotating
stars is favoured in the turbulent medium of violently star-forming galaxies
irrespective of metallicity, the IMF needs to be skewed towards high-mass stars
in order to explain the CNO isotope ratios observed in SMGs. If, instead,
stellar rotation becomes negligible beyond a given metallicity threshold, as is
the case for our own Galaxy, there is no need to invoke a top-heavy IMF in
starbursts.

in extreme value analysis. However, most of the corresponding theory is derived
under the simplifying assumption that block maxima are independent observations
from a genuine extreme value distribution. In practice however, block sizes are
finite and observations from different blocks are dependent. Theory respecting
the latter complications is not well developed, and, in the multivariate case,
has only recently been established for disjoint blocks of a single block size.
We show that using overlapping blocks instead of disjoint blocks leads to a
uniform improvement in the asymptotic variance of the multivariate empirical
distribution function of rescaled block maxima and any smooth functionals
thereof (such as the empirical copula), without any sacrifice in the asymptotic
bias. We further derive functional central limit theorems for multivariate
empirical distribution functions and empirical copulas that are uniform in the
block size parameter, which seems to be the first result of this kind for
estimators based on block maxima in general. The theory allows for various
aggregation schemes over multiple block sizes, leading to substantial
improvements over the single block length case and opens the door to further
methodology developments. In particular, we consider bias correction procedures
that can improve the convergence rates of extreme-value estimators and shed
some new light on estimation of the second-order parameter when the main
purpose is bias correction.

poured inside a closed conduit, and the grains settled on its bottom wall
forming one conical heap. As different turbulent water flows were imposed, each
heap evolved to a barchan dune, which was filmed with a high-speed camera. An
image processing code was written to identify some of the moving grains and
compute their velocity fields and trajectories. Our results show that the
velocity of grains varies along the barchan dune, with higher velocities
occurring close to the dune centroid, and that grains trajectories are
intermittent. Depending on the region over the dune, we found that the velocity
fields present values within 1 and 10 % of the cross-sectional mean velocity of
the fluid. Considering the average trajectories of grains moving over a given
dune, their mean displacement varies within 30 and 60 grain diameters and their
characteristic velocities within 10 and 20 % of the cross-sectional mean
velocity of the fluid. The displacement time varies between 30 and 90 % of the
settling time, and it seems to have two asymptotic behaviors: one close to bed
load inception and other far from it. When compared with bed load over a plane
bed, we observe that grains have the same mean velocity, but they travel
distances up to 5 times larger, with higher densities of moving grains.

field. The electromagnetic field is governed by classical Maxwell's equations,
while energy is absorbed from and emitted to the (surrounding) field according
to the transitions occurring for the emitters, which are governed by
time-dependent probability functions. These probabilities are principally
consistent with quantum mechanics. In order to validate the proposed method, it
is applied to three different test-cases; directionality of fluorescent
emission in a corrugated single-hole gold nano-disk, spatial and temporal
coherence of fluorescent emission in a hybrid photonic-plasmonic crystal, and
stimulated emission of a core-shell SPASER. The results are shown to be closely

uncertainty in a field of interest from a measurement of a related field when
the two are linked by a physical model. Despite its many applications, Bayesian
inference faces challenges when inferring fields that have discrete
representations of large dimension, and/or have prior distributions that are
difficult to represent mathematically. In this manuscript we consider the use
of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in addressing these challenges. A GAN
is a type of deep neural network equipped with the ability to learn the
distribution implied by multiple samples of a given field. Once trained on
these samples, the generator component of a GAN maps the iid components of a
low-dimensional latent vector to an approximation of the distribution of the
field of interest. In this work we demonstrate how this approximate
distribution may be used as a prior in a Bayesian update, and how it addresses
the challenges associated with characterizing complex prior distributions and
the large dimension of the inferred field. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
approach by applying it to the problem of inferring and quantifying uncertainty
in the initial temperature field in a heat conduction problem from a noisy
measurement of the temperature at later time.

First, we provide a qualified defence of the value of less data within the

big data driven AI, namely a) the limited track record of Deep Learning in key
areas such as Natural Language Processing, b) the regulatory and business
significance of being able to learn from few data points. Second, we briefly
sketch what we refer to as a case of AI with humans and for humans, namely an
AI paradigm whereby the systems we build are privacy-oriented and focused on

conclude that when seen through the lens of cognitively inspired AI, the bright

fewer.

intersection by not only reducing the number of signal phases but also change
the configuration of the conflicting points by re-routing traffic. However the
AID studies have rarely been extended to Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV)
which is expected to revolutionize our transportation system. In this study, we
investigate the potential benefits of CAV to two AIDs: the diverging diamond
interchange (DDI) and the restricted crossing U-turn intersection. The
potential enhancements of AID, CAV, and the combination of both are quantified
via microscopic traffic simulation. We found that CAV is able to positively
contribute to the performance of an intersection. However, converting an
existing conventional diamond interchange (CDI) to a diverging one is a more
effective way according to the simulation results. DDI improves the throughput
of a CDI by 950 vehicles per hour, a near 20% improvement; whereas with full
penetration of CAV, the throughput of a CDI is increased only by 300 vehicles
per hour. A similar trend is observed in the average delay per vehicle as well.
Furthermore, we assess the impact for the driver's confusion, a concern for
deploying AIDs, on the traffic flow. According to the ANOVA test, the negative
impacts of driver's confusion are of statistical significance.

can be regarded as gradient methods with approximately optimal stepsizes. In
this paper, based on the work (Numer. Algorithms 78(1), 21-39, 2018), we
present an improved gradient method with approximately optimal stepsize based
on conic model for unconstrained optimization. If the objective function $ f $
is not close to a quadratic on the line segment between the current and latest
iterates, we construct a conic model to generate approximately optimal stepsize
for gradient method if the conic model can be used; otherwise, we construct
some quadratic models to generate approximately optimal stepsizes for gradient
method. The convergence of the proposed method is analyzed under suitable
conditions. Numerical comparisons with some well-known conjugate gradient

generates region proposals, the second stage subsequently categorizes them.
Unlike in natural images, however, for anatomical structures of interest such
as tumors, the appearance in the image (e.g., scale or intensity) links to a
malignancy grade that lies on a continuous ordinal scale. While classification
models discard this ordinal relation between grades by discretizing the
continuous scale to an unordered bag of categories, regression models are
trained with distance metrics, which preserve the relation. This advantage
becomes all the more important in the setting of label confusions on ambiguous

Reg R-CNN, which replaces the second-stage classification model of a current

elements being unknown and only approximate elements available. Such a group
becomes inconsistent with its own multiplication table. We found simple
correction formula for such group. When applied iteratively this formula gives
fast convergence of the group elements and allows to perform the group
reconstruction. Next we considered small unitary rotation of entire group which
makes the group consistent with a set of additional conditions. For example, we
might demand that group elements act on certain set of vectors in a predefined
manner. Again, iterative procedure based on this correction shows fast
convergence. All algorithms developed in this paper were implemented in a
Python library which is available as open source software.

spacetime is considered. The action depends on a pair of independent field
variables, the brane embedding functions, through the canonical momentum of a
reparametrization invariant geometric model for the brane, and an auxiliary
vector field. The form of the action is analogous to a symplectic potential.
Extremization of the simultaneous action produces at once the equations of
motion and the Jacobi equations for the brane geometric model, and it also
provides a convenient shortcut towards its second variation. In this note, we
consider geometric models depending only on the intrinsic geometry of the brane
worldvolume, and discuss briefly the generalization to extrinsic geometry
dependent models. The approach is illustrated for Dirac-NambuGoto [DNG] branes.
For a relativistic particle, a simultaneous action was introduced by Bazanski,
that served as an inspiration for the present work.

interest-rate risk for saving is a fuzzy number. The total utility of
consumption is defined by using a concept of possibilistic expected utility. A
notion of possibilistic precautionary saving is introduced as a measure of the
variation of optimal saving level when moving from a sure saving model to a
possibilistic risk model. A first result establishes a necessary and sufficient
condition that the presence of a possibilistic interest-rate risk generates an
extra-saving. This result can be seen as a possibilistic version of a
Rothschilld and Stiglitz theorem on a probabilistic model of saving. A second
result of the paper studies the variation of the optimal saving level when
moving from a probabilistic model (the interest-rate risk is a random variable)
to a possibilistic model (the interest-rate risk is a fuzzy number).

naturally become roughly sparse? Using the Taxi-Euclidean norm to measure
sparsity, we find that frequent input words are associated with concentrated or
sparse activations, while frequent target words are associated with dispersed
activations but concentrated gradients. We find that gradients associated with
function words are more concentrated than the gradients of content words, even
controlling for word frequency.

  Verification","Accepted by ACL 2019",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fact verification (FV) is a challenging task which requires to retrieve
relevant evidence from plain text and use the evidence to verify given claims.
Many claims require to simultaneously integrate and reason over several pieces
of evidence for verification. However, previous work employs simple models to
extract information from evidence without letting evidence communicate with
each other, e.g., merely concatenate the evidence for processing. Therefore,
these methods are unable to grasp sufficient relational and logical information
among the evidence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a graph-based evidence
aggregating and reasoning (GEAR) framework which enables information to
transfer on a fully-connected evidence graph and then utilizes different
aggregators to collect multi-evidence information. We further employ BERT, an
effective pre-trained language representation model, to improve the
performance. Experimental results on a large-scale benchmark dataset FEVER have
demonstrated that GEAR could leverage multi-evidence information for FV and
thus achieves the promising result with a test FEVER score of 67.10%. Our code
is available at https://github.com/thunlp/GEAR.

and the association strength among the vectors of a tuple is termed as the
\emph{hyperlink weight}, that is assumed to be symmetric with respect to
permutation of the entries in the index. We herein propose Bregman hyperlink
regression (BHLR), which learns a user-specified symmetric similarity function
such that it predicts the tuple's hyperlink weight from data vectors stored in
the $U$-tuple. BHLR is a simple and general framework for hyper-relational
learning, that minimizes Bregman-divergence (BD) between the hyperlink weights
and estimated similarities defined for the corresponding tuples; BHLR
encompasses various existing methods, such as logistic regression ($U=1$),
Poisson regression ($U=1$), link prediction ($U=2$), and those for
representation learning, such as graph embedding ($U=2$), matrix factorization
($U=2$), tensor factorization ($U \geq 2$), and their variants equipped with
arbitrary BD. Nonlinear functions (e.g., neural networks), can be employed for
the similarity functions. However, there are theoretical challenges such that
some of different tuples of BHLR may share data vectors therein, unlike the
i.i.d. setting of classical regression. We address these theoretical issues,
and proved that BHLR equipped with arbitrary BD and $U \in \mathbb{N}$ is (P-1)
statistically consistent, that is, it asymptotically recovers the underlying
true conditional expectation of hyperlink weights given data vectors, and (P-2)
computationally tractable, that is, it is efficiently computed by stochastic
optimization algorithms using a novel generalized minibatch sampling procedure
for hyper-relational data. Consequently, theoretical guarantees for BHLR
including several existing methods, that have been examined experimentally, are
provided in a unified manner.

theoretical scalable ways to structuring large classes of computation. It
started from attempts to optimize R code for machine learning/artificial
intelligence algorithms for huge data sets, that due to their size, should be
handled into an incremental (online) fashion.
  Our target are large classes of relational (attribute based), mathematical
(index based) or graph computations. We wanted to use powerful computation
representations that emerged in AI (artificial intelligence)/ML (machine
learning) as BN (Bayesian networks) and CNN (convolution neural networks). For
the classes of computation addressed by us, and for our HPC (high performance
computing) needs, the current solutions for translating computations into such
representation need to be extended.
  Our results show that the classes of computation targeted by us, could be
tree-structured, and a probability distribution (defining a DBN, i.e. Dynamic
Bayesian Network) associated with it. More ever, this DBN may be viewed as a
recursive CNN (Convolution Neural Network). Within this tree-like structure,
classification in classes with size bounded (by a parameterizable may be
performed.
  These results are at the core of very powerful, yet highly practically
algorithms for restructuring and parallelizing the computations. The
mathematical background required for an in depth presentation and exposing the
full generality of our approach) is the subject of a subsequent paper. In this
paper, we work in an limited (but important) framework that could be understood
with rudiments of linear algebra and graph theory. The focus is in
applicability, most of this paper discuss the usefulness of our approach for
solving hard compilation problems related to automatic parallelism.
