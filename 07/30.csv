Control and a requirement for successful operation of a spacecraft.
  ELROI, the Extremely Low Resource Optical Identifier, is a new concept that
can provide a self-powered satellite identification beacon in a package the
size of a thick postage stamp. Its small size, low cost, and fully autonomous
operation make it usable by all space objects, including CubeSats and inert
debris objects.
  The beacon's signal is received on the ground using a small telescope
equipped with a photon-counting detector which can unambiguously determine the
satellite identification number during a single pass overhead. Additional
information can be included in the signal to aid in anomaly diagnosis and
resolution, further improving spaceflight reliability and safety.
  The first ELROI unit in orbit was launched December, 2018 as a payload on the
student CubeSat NMTSat. We are now searching for the identification signal.

  IoT-based Crowdsourcing under Continuous Platform Competition","13 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crowdsourcing can be applied to the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems to
provide more scalable and efficient services to support various tasks. As the
driving force of crowdsourcing is the interaction among participants, various
incentive mechanisms have been proposed to attract and retain a sufficient
number of participants to provide a sustainable crowdsourcing service. However,
there exist some gaps between the modeled entities or markets in the existing
works and those in reality: 1) \textit{dichotomous} task valuation and workers'
punctuality, and 2) crowdsourcing service market \textit{monopolized} by a
platform. To bridge those gaps of such impractical assumption, we model
workers' heterogeneous punctuality behavior and task depreciation over time.
Based on those models, we propose an Expected Social Welfare Maximizing (ESWM)
mechanism that aims to maximize the expected social welfare by attracting and
retaining more participants in the long-term, i.e., multiple rounds of
crowdsourcing. In the evaluation, we modeled the continuous competition between
the ESWM and one of the existing works in both short-term and long-term
scenarios. Simulation results show that the ESWM mechanism achieves higher
expected social welfare and platform utility than the benchmark by attracting
and retaining more participants. Moreover, we prove that the ESWM mechanism
achieves the desirable economic properties: individual rationality,
budget-balance, computational efficiency, and truthfulness.

their theoretical limits. However, no concrete operators have been
investigated.
  In this paper, we address this issue by presenting the first concrete
operator that satisfies strong persistence - a property that seems to best
capture the essence of forgetting in the context of ASP - whenever this is
possible, and many other important properties. The operator is syntactic,
limiting the computation of the forgetting result to manipulating the rules in

molecules, with emphasis on quantum-interference effects. Using Wigner
quasi-probability distributions and the quantum Liouville equation, we show
that the momentum gates reported in a previous publication [N. Takemoto and A.
Becker, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{84}, 023401 (2011)] may occur for static driving
fields, and even for no external field at all. Their primary cause is an
interference-induced bridging mechanism that occurs if both wells in the
molecule are populated. In the phase-space regions for which quantum bridges
occur, the Wigner functions perform a clockwise rotation whose period is
intrinsic to the molecule. This evolution is essentially non-classical and
non-adiabatic, as it does not follow equienergy curves or field gradients.
Quasi-probability transfer via quantum bridges is favoured if the electron's
initial state is either spatially delocalised, or situated at the upfield
molecular well. Enhanced ionisation results from the interplay of this cyclic
motion, adiabatic tunnel ionisation and population trapping. Optimal conditions
require minimising population trapping and using the bridging mechanism to feed
into ionisation pathways along the field gradient.

that the universal prethermal dynamics is controlled by two fixed points
depending on the size of the quench. Besides the usual equilibrium chiral Ising
fixed point for a shallow quench, a dynamical chiral Ising fixed point is
identified for a deep quench. Intriguingly, the latter is a non-thermal fixed
point without any equilibrium counterpart due to the participation of gapless
fermionic fields. We also find that in the scaling regime controlled by the
equilibrium fixed point, the initial slip exponent is rendered negative if
there are enough flavors of fermions, thus providing a unique signature of
fermionic prethermal dynamics. We then explore the temporal crossover between
the universal scaling regimes governed by the two universality classes.
Possible experimental realizations are also discussed.

where the local plasma conditions are such that the plasma is not fully
ionised, for example in the lower solar atmosphere and molecular clouds. In a
partially ionised system, the fluids couple via collisions which occur at
characteristic frequencies, therefore neutral and plasma species become
decoupled for sufficiently high-frequency dynamics. Here we present
high-resolution 2D two-fluid simulations of the nonlinear KHi for a system that
traverses the dynamic scales between decoupled fluids and coupled dynamics. We
discover some interesting phenomena, including the presence of a density
coupling that is independent of the velocity coupling. Using these simulations
we analyse the heating rate, and two regimes appear. The first is a regime
where the neutral flow is decoupled from the magnetic field that is
characterised with a constant heating rate, then at larger scales the strong
coupling approximation holds and the heating rate. At large scales with the KHi
layer width to the $-2$ power. There is an energy cascade in the simulation,
but the nature of the frictional heating means the heating rate is determined
by the largest scale of the turbulent motions, a fact that has consequences for
understanding turbulent dissipation in multi-fluid systems.

labels. Ordinal regression is a method to predict ordinal labels that finds a
wide range of applications in data-rich domains, such as natural, health and
social sciences. Most existing ordinal regression approaches work well for
independent and identically distributed (IID) instances via formulating a
single ordinal regression task. However, for heterogeneous non-IID instances
with well-defined local geometric structures, e.g., subpopulation groups,
multi-task learning (MTL) provides a promising framework to encode task
(subgroup) relatedness, bridge data from all tasks, and simultaneously learn
multiple related tasks in efforts to improve generalization performance. Even
though MTL methods have been extensively studied, there is barely existing work
investigating MTL for heterogeneous data with ordinal labels. We tackle this
important problem via sparse and deep multi-task approaches. Specifically, we
develop a regularized multi-task ordinal regression (MTOR) model for smaller
datasets and a deep neural networks based MTOR model for large-scale datasets.
We evaluate the performance using three real-world healthcare datasets with
applications to multi-stage disease progression diagnosis. Our experiments
indicate that the proposed MTOR models markedly improve the prediction
performance comparing with single-task ordinal regression models.

distribution for dark matter (DM) particles in the Galaxy, the most stringent
current constraints on their spin-dependent scattering cross-section with
nucleons come from the IceCube neutrino observatory and the PICO-60 C$_3$F$_8$
superheated bubble chamber experiments. The former is sensitive to high energy
neutrinos from the self-annihilation of DM particles captured in the Sun, while
the latter looks for nuclear recoil events from DM scattering off nucleons.
Although slower DM particles are more likely to be captured by the Sun, the
faster ones are more likely to be detected by PICO. Recent N-body simulations
suggest significant deviations from the SHM for the smooth halo component of
the DM, while observations hint at a dominant fraction of the local DM being in
substructures. We use the method of Ferrer et al. (2015) to exploit the
complementarity between the two approaches and derive conservative constraints
on DM-nucleon scattering. Our results constrain $\sigma_{\mathrm{SD}} \lesssim
3 \times 10^{-39} \mathrm{cm}^2$ (6 $ \times 10^{-38} \mathrm{cm}^2$) at

the physics of Rydberg-atom arrays - in which positional disorder of the spins
induces a randomization of the spin-spin couplings and of an on-site
longitudinal field. This form of disorder preserves long-range order in the
ground state, while it localizes the elementary excitations above it,
faithfully described as spin waves: the spin-wave spectrum is partially
localized for weak disorder (seemingly exhibiting mobility edges between
localized and extended, yet non-ergodic states), while it is fully localized
for strong disorder. The regime of partially localized excitations exhibits a
very rich non-equilibrium dynamics following a low-energy quench: correlations
and entanglement spread with a power-law behavior whose exponent is a
continuous function of disorder, interpolating between ballistic and arrested

experimental verification using quantum simulators of closed quantum many-body

general $\Phi\,$-configurations for a class of $\Phi:\mathbb R^d\times\mathbb
R^d\to\mathbb R^k$, and showing that, under suitable lower bounds on
$\dim_{\mathcal H}(E)$ and a regularity assumption on the family of generalized
Radon transforms associated with $\Phi$, it follows that the set
$\Delta_\Phi(E)$ of $\Phi$-configurations in $E$ has nonempty interior in
$\mathbb R^k$. Further extensions hold for $\Phi\,$-configurations generated by
two sets, $E$ and $F$, in spaces of possibly different dimensions and with
suitable lower bounds on $\dim_{\mathcal H}(E)+\dim_{\mathcal H}(F)$.

number resolving detection of the coherently displaced signal. For a given
power constraint and channel noise strength, these novel strategies rely on
joint optimization of the input alphabet and the measurement to provide
enhanced communication capability over a non-Gaussian channel characterized in

on equations of state. As an application, we use our theory to address the
non-univerisal ground-state energy of strongly paired fermions, due to the
non-trivial momentum dependence of the phase shift characterized, for example,
by effective range. We find a good agreement between our predictions and recent
quantum Monte Carlo simulations on the effective-range dependence in both three

interacting dark matter (IDM) model would imply a suppression of small-scale
structures due to a large collisional damping effect, even though the weakly
interacting massive particle (WIMP) can still be the DM candidate. Because of
this, IDM models can help alleviate alleged tensions between standard CDM
predictions and observations at small mass scales. In this work, we investigate
the properties of DM halo substructure or subhalos formed in a high-resolution
cosmological N-body simulation specifically run within these alternative
models. We also run its CDM counterpart, which allowed us to compare subhalo
properties in both cosmologies. We show that, in the lower mass range covered
by our simulation runs, both subhalo concentrations and abundances are
systematically lower in IDM compared to the CDM scenario. Yet, as in CDM, we
find that median IDM subhalo concentration values increase towards the
innermost regions of their hosts for same mass subhalos. Also similarly to CDM,
we find IDM subhalos to be more concentrated than field halos of the same mass.
Our work has a direct application on studies aimed at the indirect detection of
DM where subhalos are expected to boost the DM signal of their host halos
significantly. From our results, we conclude that the role of halo substructure
in DM searches will be less important in interacting scenarios than in CDM, but
is nevertheless far from being negligible.

decorated by objects and morphisms of a pivotal fusion category modulo local
relations. String-net models are usually considered for spherical fusion
categories, and in this case the vector spaces agree with the state spaces of
the corresponding Turaev-Viro topological quantum field theory.
  In the present work some effects of dropping the sphericality condition are
investigated. In one example of non-spherical pivotal fusion categories, the
string-net space counts the number of r-spin structures on a surface and
carries an isomorphic representation of the mapping class group. Another
example concerns the string-net space of a sphere with one marked point
labelled by a simple object Z of the Drinfeld centre. This space is found to be
non-zero iff Z is isomorphic to a non-unit simple object determined by the

challenges to be initial states of the $N$-node network and responses to be
states captured during the subsequent chaotic transient. We find that the

the types of captured orbits which arise from planetesimals originating from
the interstellar medium, exo-Kuiper belts and exo-Oort clouds. We find that the
rate of interstellar medium injection is negligible, whereas capture of both
exo-Kuiper and exo-Oort cloud planetesimals is viable, but strongly
size-dependent. For a gaseous disc which extends much beyond its Roche limit,
capture is more probable than disruption at the Roche limit. We find that the
capture probability linearly increases with the radial extent of the disc. Even
in systems without minor planets, capture of smaller bodies will change the
disc size distribution and potentially its temporal variability. Our formalism
is general enough to be applied to future discoveries of embedded planetesimals
in white dwarf debris discs.

of energy from their innermost to outermost regions, which leads to a slow and
steady contraction of the core until it ultimately collapses under gravity.
However, in spite of the natural tendency toward so-called ""core collapse,"" the
globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way exhibit a well-observed bimodal
distribution in core radii separating the core-collapsed and non-core-collapsed
clusters. This suggests an internal energy source is at work, delaying the
onset of core collapse in many clusters. Primordial binary stars have been
thought for a long time to provide this energy source, but recent analyses have
cast doubt upon the corresponding ""binary-burning"" mechanism as a viable
explanation. Over the past decade, a large amount of both observational and
theoretical work has suggested that many stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are
retained in typical clusters today and that they play a dynamically-significant
role in these clusters throughout their entire lifetimes. Here we review our
latest understanding of the formation and evolution of BH populations in GCs

these are known as boson/Proca stars. Firstly, we consider the formation
scenario. Starting with constraint-obeying initial data, describing a dilute,
axisymmetric cloud of spinning scalar/Proca field, gravitational collapse
towards a spinning star occurs, via gravitational cooling. In the scalar case
the formation is transient, even for a non-perturbed initial cloud; a
non-axisymmetric instability always develops ejecting all the angular momentum
from the scalar star. In the Proca case, by contrast, no instability is
observed and the evolutions are compatible with the formation of a spinning
Proca star. Secondly, we address the stability of an existing star, a
stationary solution of the field equations. In the scalar case, a
non-axisymmetric perturbation develops collapsing the star to a spinning black
hole. No such instability is found in the Proca case, where the star survives
large amplitude perturbations; moreover, some excited Proca stars decay to, and
remain as, fundamental states. Our analysis suggests bosonic stars have
different stability properties in the scalar/vector case, which we tentatively
relate to their toroidal/spheroidal morphology. A parallelism with
instabilities of spinning fluid stars is briefly discussed.

such as Chern numbers and topological spins, that quantize their response to
electromagnetic currents and changes of ambient geometry. Intriguingly, in the
$\nu=2/5$ fractional quantum Hall effect, prominent theoretical approaches --
the composite fermion theory and conformal field theory -- have constructed two
distinct states, the Jain composite fermion (CF) state and the Gaffnian state,
for which many of the topological indices coincide and even the microscopic
ground state wave functions have high overlap with each other in system sizes
accessible to numerics. At the same time, some aspects of these states are
expected to be very different, e.g., their elementary excitations should have
either Abelian (CF) or non-Abelian (Gaffnian) statistics. In this paper we
investigate the close relationship between these two states by considering not
only their ground states, but also the low-energy charged excitations. We show
that the low-energy physics of both phases is spanned by the same type of
quasielectrons of the neighbouring Laughlin phase. The main difference between
the two states arises due to an implicit assumption of short-range interaction
in the CF approach, which causes a large splitting of the variational energies
of the Gaffnian excitations. We thus propose that the Jain phase emerges as an
effective Abelian low-energy description of the Gaffnian phase when the
Hamiltonian is dominated by two-body interactions of sufficiently short range.

which an evolved star engulfs its companion upon expansion, is the critical
evolutionary stage forming short-period, compact-object binary systems, such as
coalescing double compact objects, X-ray binaries, and cataclysmic variables.
In this work, we adapt the one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code,
MESA, to model the inspiral of a 1.4M$_{\odot}$ neutron star (NS) inside the
envelope of a 12$M_{\odot}$ red supergiant star. We self-consistently calculate
the drag force experienced by the NS as well as the back-reaction onto the
expanding envelope as the NS spirals in. Nearly all of the hydrogen envelope
escapes, expanding to large radii ($\sim$10$^2$ AU) where it forms an optically
thick envelope with temperatures low enough that dust formation occurs. We
simulate the NS orbit until only 0.8M$_{\odot}$ of the hydrogen envelope
remains around the giant star's core. Our results suggest that the inspiral
will continue until another $\approx$0.3M$_{\odot}$ are removed, at which point
the remaining envelope will retract. Upon separation, a phase of dynamically
stable mass transfer onto the NS accretor is likely to ensue, which may be
observable as an ultraluminous X-ray source. The resulting binary, comprised of
a detached 2.6M$_{\odot}$ helium-star and a NS with a separation of
3.3-5.7R$_{\odot}$, is expected to evolve into a merging double neutron-star,
analogous to those recently detected by LIGO/Virgo. For our chosen combination
of binary parameters, our estimated final separation (including the phase of
stable mass transfer) suggests a very high $\alpha_{\rm CE}$-equivalent
efficiency of $\approx$5.

two-dimensional crystals and fracton tensor gauge theories, expanding on recent
works by two of the present authors. We begin by dualizing the quantum
elasticity theory of an ordinary commensurate crystal, which maps directly onto
a fracton tensor gauge theory, in a natural tensor analogue of the conventional
particle-vortex duality transformation of a superfluid. The transverse and
longitudinal phonons of a crystal map onto the two gapless gauge modes of the
tensor gauge theory, while the topological lattice defects map onto the gauge
charges, with disclinations corresponding to isolated fractons and dislocations
corresponding to dipoles of fractons. We use the classical limit of this
duality to make new predictions for the finite-temperature phase diagram of
fracton models, and provide a simpler derivation of the Halperin-Nelson-Young
theory of thermal melting of two-dimensional solids. We extend this duality to
incorporate bosonic statistics, which is necessary for a description of the
quantum melting transitions. We thereby derive a hybrid vector-tensor gauge
theory which describes a supersolid phase, hosting both crystalline and
superfluid orders. The structure of this gauge theory puts constraints on the
quantum phase diagram of bosons, and also leads to the concept of symmetry
enriched fracton order. We formulate the extension of these dualities to
systems breaking time-reversal symmetry. We also discuss the broader
implications of these dualities, such as a possible connection between fracton
phases and the study of interacting topological crystalline insulators.

rates than optical searches. We detect a total of 10 hard X-ray sources and 10
compact radio sources at luminosities consistent with star-formation-related
emission. We find one case of a spatially-coincident X-ray and radio source
within the astrometric uncertainties. If the X-ray and radio emission are
indeed coming from the same source, the origin of the radiation is plausibly
from an active massive BH with log $(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \sim 4.8 \pm 1.1$.
However, given that the X-ray and radio emission are also coincident with a
young star cluster complex, we consider the combination of an X-ray binary and

we do not find compelling evidence for active massive BHs in our target BCDs,

studying whether or not a system is self-sustaining. However, the design and
development of efficient parallel algorithms for the transport criticality
calculations is challenging especially when the number of processor cores is
large and an unstructured mesh is adopted. In particular, both the compute time
and memory usage have to be carefully taken into consideration due to the
dimensionality of the neutron transport equations. In this paper, we study a
monolithic multilevel Schwarz preconditioner for the transport criticality

propose a monolithic multilevel Schwarz method that is capable of efficiently
handling the systems of linear equations for both the transport system and the
diffusion system. However, in the multilevel method, algebraically constructing
coarse spaces is expensive and often unscalable. We study a subspace-based
coarsening algorithm to address such a challenge by exploring the matrix
structures of the transport equations and the nonlinear diffusion equations. We
numerically demonstrate that the monolithic multilevel preconditioner with the
subspace-based coarsening algorithm is twice as fast as that equipped with an
unmodified coarsening approach on thousands of processor cores for an

uncertainty principle (GUP) to the form $\Delta x \Delta p \geq
\frac{\hbar}{2}\frac{1}{1-\alpha\Delta x^2} $, where $\alpha\equiv
l_{max}^{-2}$. The effects of this GUP on simple quantum mechanical systems has
been shown recently by one of the authors\cite{Perivolaropoulos:2017rgq} to be
extremely small (beyond current measurements) due to the extremely large scale
of the current particle horizon. This is not the case in the Early Universe
during the quantum generation of the inflationary primordial fluctuation
spectrum. We estimate the effects of such GUP on the primordial fluctuation
spectrum and on the corresponding spectral index. We generalize the field
commutation (GFC) relation to
$[\varphi(k),\pi_{\varphi}(k')]$=$i\delta(k-k')\frac{1}{1-\mu\varphi^2(k)}$,
where $\mu\sim \alpha^2\equiv l_{max}^{-4}$ is a GFC parameter, $\varphi$

l_{max}^3$ is the volume corresponding to $l_{max}$) and $P_S^{(0)}(k)$ is the
standard primordial spectrum obtained in the context of the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle ($\mu=0$). We show that the predicted scalar spectral
index is $n_s=1-\lambda-\frac{\bar{\mu}}{k}$ where $\lambda$ is a slow-roll
parameter. Using observational constraints on the scale dependence of the

non-linear theory of gravity (i.e., general relativity) via a coupling to the
stress-energy of the model. In this work, I extend this procedure to a
""Lorentz-violating"" gravitational model, in which the linear tensor field and
the matter fields ""see"" different metrics due to a coupling between the tensor
field and a background vector field. The resulting model can be thought of as a
generalized Proca theory with a non-minimal coupling to conventional matter. It
has a similar linearized limit to the better-known ""bumblebee model"", but
differs at higher orders in perturbation theory. Its effects are unobservable
in FRW spacetimes, but are expected to be important in anisotropic cosmological
spacetimes.

simple to deploy and easy to interpret. Nevertheless, being a linear model, LR
has limited expressive capability and often has unsatisfactory performance.
Generalized additive models (GAMs) extend the linear model with transformations
of input features, though feature interaction is not allowed for all GAM
variants. In this paper, we propose a factored generalized additive model
(F-GAM) to preserve the model interpretability for targeted features while
allowing a rich model for interaction with features fixed within the
individual. We evaluate F-GAM on prediction of two targets, postoperative acute
kidney injury and acute respiratory failure, from a single-center database. We
find superior model performance of F-GAM in terms of AUPRC and AUROC compared
to several other GAM implementations, random forests, support vector machine,
and a deep neural network. We find that the model interpretability is good with
results with high face validity.

1D Hubbard model that includes finite-range interactions is needed to explain
these photoemission data. To account for the effects of these finite-range
interactions we employ a mobile quantum impurity scheme that describes the
scattering of fractionalized particles at energies above the standard
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid limit. Our theoretical predictions agree
quantitatively with the location in the $(k,\omega)$ plane of the
experimentally observed ARPES structures at these higher energies. The
nonperturbative microscopic mechanisms that control the spectral properties are
found to simplify in terms of the exotic scattering of the charge
fractionalized particles. We find that the scattering occurs in the unitary
limit of (minus) infinite scattering length, which limit occurs within
neutron-neutron interactions in shells of neutron stars and in the scattering
of ultracold atoms but not in perturbative electronic condensed-matter systems.
Our results provide important physical information on the exotic processes

Subordinated Levy price processes and local volatility price processes are now

introduce the theory of multiple internally embedded financial time-clocks
motivated by behavioral finance. To be consistent with dynamic asset pricing
theory and option pricing, as suggested by behavioral finance, the investors'
view is considered by introducing an intrinsic time process which we refer to
as a behavioral subordinator. The process is subordinated to the Brownian
motion process in the well-known log-normal model, resulting in a new log-price
process. The number of embedded subordinations results in a new parameter that
must be estimated and this parameter is as important as the mean and variance
of asset returns. We describe new distributions, demonstrating how they can be
applied to modeling the tail behavior of stock market returns. We apply the
proposed models to modeling S&P 500 returns, treating the CBOE Volatility Index
as intrinsic time change and the CBOE Volatility-of-Volatility Index as the
volatility subordinator. We find that these volatility indexes are not proper
time-change subordinators in modeling the returns of the S&P 500.

the weight update is calculated by solving the corresponding boosting problem
using a linear base learner. The resulting weight update formula can also be

  MIMO-OFDM Processing","4 pages, 5 figures, extended version to be sumbitted to a journal",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning is playing an instrumental role in the design of the next
generation of communication systems. In this letter, we address the massive
MIMO interconnect's bandwidth constraint relaxation using autoencoders. The
autoencoder is trained to learn the received signal structure so that a low
dimension latent variable is transferred as opposed to the original high
dimension signal. For an efficient implementation, the approach suggests to
separately deploy the autoencoder components, namely the encoder and the
decoder, in massive MIMO radio head and central processing units respectively.
The simulation results show that one can relax the interconnect's bandwidth by
a factor of up to 16 with non-substantial performance degradation of the
centralized and the decentralized processing. Fortunately, such a loss can be
compensated by running few extra iterations in the detection process which
renders the autoencoder-iterative detection an interconnect's bandwidth and
computational complexity design trade-off.

Furthermore, a simulation study is performed in testing the procedure from
`first principles' across a wide range of credit risk scenarios. Specifically,
three probabilistic techniques are used to generate cash flows, while the

show that loss minima can exist for a select range of credit risk profiles,
which suggests that the loss optimisation of default thresholds can become a
viable practice. The default decision is therefore framed anew as an
optimisation problem in choosing a default threshold that is neither too early

wherein default is pragmatically defined as `90 days past due', with little
objective evidence for its overall suitability or financial impact, at least
beyond flawed roll rate analyses or a regulator's decree.

sensitivity to blockage and severe signal attenuation presents challenges in
their deployment in urban settings. To overcome these effects, we consider a
distributed cooperative beamforming system, which relies on static relays
deployed in clusters with similar channel characteristics, and where, at every
time instance, only one relay from each cluster is selected to participate in
beamforming to the destination. To meet the quality-of-service guarantees of
the network, a key prerequisite for beamforming is relay selection. However, as
the channels change with time, relay selection becomes a resource demanding
task. Indeed, estimation of channel state information for all candidate relays,
essential for relay selection, is a process that takes up bandwidth, wastes
power and introduces latency and interference in the network. We instead
propose a unique, predictive scheme for resource efficient relay selection,
which exploits the special propagation patterns of the mmWave medium, and can
be executed distributively across clusters, and in parallel to optimal
beamforming-based communication. The proposed predictive scheme efficiently
exploits spatiotemporal channel correlations with current and past networkwide
Received Signal Strength (RSS), the latter being invariant to relay cluster
size, measured sequentially during the operation of the system. Our numerical
results confirm that our proposed relay selection strategy outperforms any
randomized selection policy that does not exploit channel correlations,
whereas, at the same time, it performs very close to an ideal scheme that uses
complete, cluster size dependent RSS, and offers significant savings in terms
of channel estimation overhead, providing substantially better network
utilization, especially in dense topologies, typical in mmWave networks.

synchrotron feature for polarised emission. Here, we combine state-of-the-art
solutions of the synchrotron RT coefficients with numerical methods for solving
the complete system of equations of the RT problem, including Faraday rotation
(FR) as well as Faraday conversion (FC). We validate the code against Galactic

synthetic all-sky synchrotron maps for positions within the galaxy and for
extragalactic observations. For these test scenarios we apply a model of the
Milky Way based on sophisticated magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and
population-synthesis post-processing techniques.We explore different parameters
for modeling the distribution of free electrons and for a turbulent magnetic
field component. We find that a strongly fluctuating field is necessary for
simulating synthetic synchrotron observations on small scales, we argue that
Faraday rotation alone can account for the depolarisation of the synchrotron
signal, and we discuss the importance of the observer position within the Milky
Way. Altogether, we conclude that POLARIS is a highly reliable tool for
predicting synchrotron emission and polarisation, including Faraday rotation in
a realistic galactic context. It can thus contribute to better understand the
results from current and future observational missions.

computationally expensive since a high number of time steps is necessary to

the fact that they too have uncertainties and are susceptible to systematic
error. As we strive to measure cosmological parameters to better than 1% it is
worth reviewing the accuracy of our redshift measurements. Surprisingly small
systematic redshift errors, as low as 0.0001, can have a significant impact on
the cosmological parameters we infer, such as $H_0$.
  Here we investigate an extensive (but not exhaustive) list of ways in which
redshift estimation can go systematically astray. We review common theoretical
errors, such as adding redshifts instead of multiplying by (1+z); using v=cz;
and using only cosmological redshift in the estimates of luminosity and
angular-diameter distances. We consider potential observational errors, such as
rest wavelength precision, air to vacuum conversion at altitude, and
spectrograph wavelength calibration. Finally, we explore physical effects, such
as peculiar velocity corrections, galaxy internal velocities, gravitational
redshifts, and overcorrecting within a bulk flow.
  We conclude that it would be quite easy for small systematic redshift errors
to have infiltrated our data and be impacting our cosmological results. While
it is unlikely that these errors are large enough to resolve the current $H_0$
tension, it remains possible, and redshift accuracy may become a limiting
factor in near future experiments. With the enormous efforts going into
calibrating the vertical axis of our plots (standard candles, rulers, clocks,

horizontal axis (redshifts).

simultaneity with one another. This creates batches of arrivals to the
underlying queueing system. In this paper, we study the staffing problem for
the batch arrival queue. We show that batches place a dangerous and deceptive
stress on services, requiring a high amount of resources and exhibiting a
fundamentally larger tail in those demands. This uncovers a service regime in
which a system with large batch arrivals may have low utilization but will
still have non-trivial waiting. Methodologically, these staffing results follow
from novel large batch and large batch-and-rate limits of the multi-server
queueing model. In the large batch limit, we establish the first formal
connection between general multi-server queues and storage processes, another
family of stochastic models. By consequence, we show that the batch scaled
queue length process is not asymptotically normal, and that, in fact, the fluid
and diffusion-type limits coincide. Hence, the (safety) staffing of this system
must be directly proportional to the batch size just to achieve a
non-degenerate probability of wait. In exhibition of the existence and insights
of this large batch regime, we apply our results to data on Covid-19 contact
tracing in New York City. In doing so, we identify significant benefits
produced by the tracing agency's decision to staff above national
recommendations, and we also demonstrate that there may have been an
opportunity to further improve the operation by optimizing the arrival pattern
in the public health data pipeline.

Selection by Survival, Sequential Selection and Entropic Hierarchy. We use the
Tangled Nature Model of co-evolution as a common framework for investigating

as an example of an entropic hierarchy. This idea, which combines sequential
selection together with a reservoir of diversity that acts as a 'memory',
implies a tendency towards growth and increasing resilience of the Gaian system
over time. We then discuss how Gaian memory could be realised in practice via
the microbial seed bank, climate refugia and lateral gene transfer and conclude
by discussing testable implications of an entropic hierarchy for the study of
Earth history and the search for life in the universe. This paper adds to the

functions. It redistributes I/O requests among the calling processes into a
form that minimizes the file access costs. As modern parallel computers
continue to grow into the exascale era, the communication cost of such request
redistribution can quickly overwhelm collective I/O performance. This effect
has been observed from parallel jobs that run on multiple compute nodes with a
high count of MPI processes on each node. To reduce the communication cost, we
present a new design for collective I/O by adding an extra communication layer
that performs request aggregation among processes within the same compute
nodes. This approach can significantly reduce inter-node communication
congestion when redistributing the I/O requests. We evaluate the performance
and compare with the original two-phase I/O on a Cray XC40 parallel computer
with Intel KNL processors. Using I/O patterns from two large-scale production
applications and an I/O benchmark, we show the performance improvement of up to
29 times when running 16384 MPI processes on 256 compute nodes.

minimising the search space to a single block and utilising a small subset of

EPSOCNN also keeps very competitive classification accuracy by stacking the
evolved block multiple times to fit the whole dataset. The proposed EPSOCNN
algorithm is evaluated on CIFAR-10 dataset and compared with 13 peer
competitors comprised of deep CNNs crafted by hand, learned by reinforcement

a challenge in computational co-design due to the complex design of multicore

Scalable Analytical Shared Memory Model to predict the performance of parallel
applications that runs on a multicore computer and shares the same level of
cache in the hierarchy. This model uses a computationally efficient,
probabilistic method to predict the reuse distance profiles, where reuse
distance is a hardware architecture-independent measure of the patterns of
virtual memory accesses. It relies on a stochastic, static basic block-level
analysis of reuse profiles measured from the memory traces of applications ran
sequentially on small instances rather than using a multi-threaded trace. The
results indicate that the hit-rate predictions on the shared cache are

the effectiveness of our method in comparison with various baselines and model

communication systems to support high data rates. For the proper
characterization of the mmWave propagation channel, it is essential to measure
the power angular-delay profile (PADP) of the channel which includes
angle-of-departure (AoD) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the multipath components
(MPCs). In this paper, we first describe in detail our 28 GHz channel sounder
where directional horn antennas are placed on rotating gimbals. Then, for this
specific sounder class, we describe and address the following two problems in
extracting the MPCs from the measurements: 1) For the channel measurements at
large distances between the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX), it is not
possible to generate the triggering signal for the TX and the RX using a single
clock (SICL). This necessitates the use of separate clocks (SECLs) which
introduces a random timing drift between the clocks. 2) As the positions of the
antennas change during the scanning process, total distance traveled by the
same MPC differs at each measurement. These two errors together cause missing
some of the MPCs and detecting MPCs that do not exist in reality. We propose an
algorithm to correct the clock drift and the errors in the MPC delays due to
the rotation of the antennas. We compare the MPCs from the SICL measurement and
the corrected SECL measurements using a Hungarian algorithm based MPC matching
method. We show that the percentage of the matched MPCs increases from 28.36%
to 74.13% after the correction process.

Mass Ejections(CMEs) using data from the STEREO, SOHO missions and WIND
instrument. We seek to quantify the relative contributions of Lorentz force and
aerodynamic drag on their propagation. The CMEs are 3D reconstructed using the
Graduated Cylindrical Shell(GCS) model to derive observed CME parameters.Using
a microphysical prescription of the drag coefficient,we find that solar wind
aerodynamic drag adequately accounts for the dynamics of the fastest CMEs from
as low as 3.5 Rs. For relatively slower CMEs, however, we find that when the
drag-based model is initiated below the distances ranging from 12 to 50 Rs,the
observed CME trajectories cannot be accounted for.This suggests that
aerodynamic drag force dominates the dynamics of slower CMEs only above these
heights.To investigate CME dynamics below the heights where aerodynamic drag
dominates, we consider the Torus Instability model for the driving Lorentz
force. We find that for fast CMEs,Lorentz forces become negligible in
comparison to aerodynamic drag as early as 3.5-4 Rs.For slow CMEs, however,
they become negligible only by 12-50 Rs.This justifies the success of the
drag-only model for fast CMEs. In case of slow CMEs, the Lorentz force is only
slightly smaller than the drag force even beyond 12-50 Rs.For these slow
events,our results suggest that some of the magnetic flux carried by CMEs might
be expended in expansion or heating. These dissipation effects might be
important in describing the propagation of slower CMEs. To the best of our
knowledge,this is the first systematic study in this regard using a diverse CME
sample. A physical understanding of the forces that affect CME propagation and
how they compare with each other at various heliocentric distances is an
important ingredient in building tools for describing and predicting CME
trajectories.

annealers can achieve speedups. Such analog control errors are known to lead to
$J$-chaos, wherein the probability of obtaining the optimal solution, encoded
as the ground state of the intended Hamiltonian, varies widely depending on the
control error. Here, we show that $J$-chaos causes a catastrophic failure of
quantum annealing, in that the scaling of the time-to-solution metric becomes
worse than that of a deterministic (exhaustive) classical solver. We
demonstrate this empirically using random Ising spin glass problems run on the
two latest generations of the D-Wave quantum annealers. We then proceed to show
that this doomsday scenario can be mitigated using a simple error suppression
and correction scheme known as quantum annealing correction (QAC). By using
QAC, the time-to-solution scaling of the same D-Wave devices is improved to
below that of the classical upper bound, thus restoring hope in the speedup
prospects of quantum annealing.

above that expected from in situ star formation, while quenching is defined as
going from specific star formation rate sSFR$>t_{H}^{-1}$ to
sSFR$<0.2t_{H}^{-1}$, where $t_{H}$ is the Hubble time. At $z\approx 0-3$,
mergers show $\sim\times 2-3$ higher SFR than a mass-matched sample of
star-forming galaxies, but globally represent $\leq 1\%$ of the cosmic SF
budget. At low masses, the increase in SFR in mergers is mostly attributed to
an increase in the $H_2$ content, but for $M_*\geq 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$ mergers
also show an elevated star formation efficiency suggesting denser gas within
merging galaxies. The merger rate for star-forming galaxies shows a rapid
increase with redshift $\propto (1+z)^{3.5}$, but the quenching rate evolves
much more slowly, $\propto (1+z)^{0.9}$; there are insufficient mergers to
explain the quenching rate at $z\leq 1.5$. Simba first quenches galaxies at
$z\geq 3$, with a number density in good agreement with observations. The
quenching timescales $\tau_q$ are strongly bimodal, with `slow' quenchings
($\tau_q \sim 0.1t_{H}$) dominating overall, but `fast' quenchings ($\tau_q\sim
0.01 t_H$) dominating in $M_*\sim 10^{10}-10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$ galaxies, likely
induced by Simba's jet-mode black hole feedback. The delay time distribution
between mergers and quenching events suggests no physical connection to either
fast or slow quenching. Hence, Simba predicts that major mergers induce
starbursts, but are unrelated to quenching in either fast or slow mode.

inevitably introduces compression artifacts such as blocking, ringing, etc. To
compensate for those artifacts, extensive filtering techniques were proposed in
the loop of video codecs, which are capable of boosting the subjective and
objective qualities of reconstructed videos. Recently, neural network based
filters were presented with the power of deep learning from a large magnitude
of data. Though the coding efficiency has been improved from traditional
methods in High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), the rich features and
information generated by the compression pipeline has not been fully utilized

Residual-Reconstruction-based Convolutional Neural Network (RRNet) to further
improve the coding efficiency to its full extent, where the compression
features induced from bitstream in form of prediction residual is fed into the
network as an additional input to the reconstructed frame. In essence, the
residual signal can provide valuable information about block partitions and can
aid reconstruction of edge and texture regions in a picture. Thus, more
adaptive parameters can be trained to handle different texture characteristics.
The experimental results show that our proposed RRNet approach presents

aspects of medical experiences and tailor them to a specific individuals'

they ignore socially-relevant information about how this diagnosis should be
communicated and discussed with the patient. The lack of this capability may
lead to mis-communication, resulting in serious implications, such as patients
opting out of the best treatment. Consider a case in which the same treatment
is proposed to two different individuals. The manner in which this treatment is
mediated to each should be different, depending on the individual patient's
history, knowledge, and mental state. While it is clear that this communication
should be conveyed via a human medical expert and not a software-based system,
humans are not always capable of considering all of the relevant aspects and
traversing all available information. We pose the challenge of creating
Intelligent Agents (IAs) to assist medical service providers (MSPs) and
consumers in establishing a more personalized human-to-human dialogue.
Personalizing conversations will enable patients and MSPs to reach a solution
that is best for their particular situation, such that a relation of trust can
be built and commitment to the outcome of the interaction is assured. We

gravitational collapse of a uniform turbulent clump, upon which a purely radial
compressive velocity pulse is activated in the midst of the evolution of the
clump, when its turbulent state has been fully developed. The shape of the
velocity pulse is determined basically by two free parameters: the velocity
$V_0$ and the initial radial position $r_0$. In the present paper, models are
considered in which the velocity $V_0$ takes the values 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50
times the speed of sound of the clump $c_0$, while $r_0$ is fixed for all the
models. The collapse of the model with $2 \, c_0$ goes faster as a consequence
of the velocity pulse, while the cluster formed in the central region of the
isolated clump mainly stays the same. In the models with greater velocity
$V_0$, the evolution of the isolated clump is significantly changed, so that a
dense shell of gas forms around $r_0$ and moves radially inward. The radial
profile of the density and velocity as well as the mass contained in the dense
shell of gas are calculated, and it is found that (i) the higher the velocity
$V_0$, the less mass is contained in the shell; (ii) there is a critical
velocity of the pulse, around $10 \, c_0$, such that for shock models with a
lower velocity, there will be a well defined dense central region in the
shocked clump surrounded by the shell.

guide for a standardized evaluation of Twitter user geolocation by analyzing
fifteen models and two baselines in a controlled experimental setting. Models
are evaluated using ten metrics over four geographic granularities. We use rank
correlations to assess the effectiveness of these metrics.
  Our results demonstrate that the choice of effectiveness metric can have a
substantial impact on the conclusions drawn from a geolocation system

relative effectiveness. We show that for general evaluations, a range of

measure the impact of the bias in distribution over locations. Although a lot
of complex geolocation algorithms have been applied in recent years, a majority

significantly limits the discriminability of learned features. To resolve this
issue, we propose MAP-VAE to enable the learning of global and local geometry
by jointly leveraging global and local self-supervision. To enable effective
local self-supervision, we introduce multi-angle analysis for point clouds. In
a multi-angle scenario, we first split a point cloud into a front half and a
back half from each angle, and then, train MAP-VAE to learn to predict a back
half sequence from the corresponding front half sequence. MAP-VAE performs this
half-to-half prediction using RNN to simultaneously learn each local geometry
and the spatial relationship among them. In addition, MAP-VAE also learns
global geometry via self-reconstruction, where we employ a variational
constraint to facilitate novel shape generation. The outperforming results in
four shape analysis tasks show that MAP-VAE can learn more discriminative
global or local features than the state-of-the-art methods.

existing analytical models cannot be directly applied to AmBC due to the

the first step to fill the gap, by exploring the use of spatial modulation (SM)
in AmBC whenever tags are equipped with multiple antennas. Specifically, we
present a practical multiple-antenna backscatter design for AmBC that exempts
tags from the inter-antenna synchronization and mutual coupling problems while
ensuring high spectral efficiency and ultra-low power consumption. We obtain an

millimeter-Wave communications (mmWave-NOMA). Particularly, we consider
downlink transmission with a hybrid beamforming structure. A user grouping
algorithm is first proposed according to the channel correlations of the users.
Whereafter, a joint hybrid beamforming and power allocation problem is
formulated to maximize the achievable sum rate, subject to a minimum rate
constraint for each user. To solve this non-convex problem with
high-dimensional variables, we first obtain the solution of power allocation
under arbitrary fixed hybrid beamforming, which is divided into intra-group
power allocation and inter-group power allocation. Then, given arbitrary fixed
analog beamforming, we utilize the approximate zero-forcing method to design
the digital beamforming to minimize the inter-group interference. Finally, the
analog beamforming problem with the constant-modulus constraint is solved with
a proposed boundary-compressed particle swarm optimization algorithm.
Simulation results show that the proposed joint approach, including user
grouping, hybrid beamforming and power allocation, outperforms the
state-of-the-art schemes and the conventional mmWave orthogonal multiple access
system in terms of achievable sum rate and energy efficiency.

  correction using the covariate's posterior mean, aka the inclusive factor
  score",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address measurement error bias in propensity score (PS) analysis due to
covariates that are latent variables. In the setting where latent covariate $X$
is measured via multiple error-prone items $\mathbf{W}$, PS analysis using
several proxies for $X$ -- the $\mathbf{W}$ items themselves, a summary score
(mean/sum of the items), or the conventional factor score (cFS , i.e.,
predicted value of $X$ based on the measurement model) -- often results in
biased estimation of the causal effect, because balancing the proxy (between
exposure conditions) does not balance $X$. We propose an improved proxy: the
conditional mean of $X$ given the combination of $\mathbf{W}$, the observed
covariates $Z$, and exposure $A$, denoted $X_{WZA}$. The theoretical support,
which applies whether $X$ is latent or not (but is unobserved), is that
balancing $X_{WZA}$ (e.g., via weighting or matching) implies balancing the
mean of $X$. For a latent $X$, we estimate $X_{WZA}$ by the inclusive factor
score (iFS) -- predicted value of $X$ from a structural equation model that
captures the joint distribution of $(X,\mathbf{W},A)$ given $Z$. Simulation
shows that PS analysis using the iFS substantially improves balance on the
first five moments of $X$ and reduces bias in the estimated causal effect.
Hence, within the proxy variables approach, we recommend this proxy over
existing ones. We connect this proxy method to known results about
weighting/matching functions (Lockwood & McCaffrey, 2016; McCaffrey, Lockwood,
& Setodji, 2013). We illustrate the method in handling latent covariates when
estimating the effect of out-of-school suspension on risk of later police
arrests using Add Health data.

approximate the Hamiltonian function on this constructed space, and the two

the use of Gaussian processes for the estimation of such a Hamiltonian. After
two illustrative examples, we extract an underlying phase space as well as the
generating Hamiltonian from a collection of movies of a pendulum. The approach
is fully data-driven, and does not assume a particular form of the Hamiltonian

on the tunability of the coefficient of the third-order cross term and ground
state hyperpolarizability, which are inherently dependent on the degree of
circular polarization of the trap laser. Experimentally, polarization of the
ODT array for $^{85}$Rb qubits is finely adjusted to a definite value so that
its working magnetic field required for magic trapping amounts to the one
required for magically trapping $^{87}$Rb qubits in another ODT array with
fully circular polarization. Ultimately, in such a polarization-mediated MI-ODT
array, the coherence times of $^{87}$Rb and $^{85}$Rb qubits are respectively
enhanced up to 891$\pm$47 ms and 943$\pm$35 ms. Furthermore, a new source of

achieve near-real-time mass data observation, processing and transmission over

multi-dimensional heterogeneous resources (i.e., observation resource,
computation resource and transmission resource) to improve network performance.
However, the time varying property of both the observation resource and
transmission resource is not fully exploited in existing studies. Dynamic
resource management according to instantaneous channel conditions has a
potential to enhance network performance. To this end, in this paper, we study
the multi-resource dynamic management problem, considering stochastic
observation and transmission channel conditions in SINs. Specifically, we
develop an aggregate optimization framework for observation scheduling,
compression ratio selection and transmission scheduling, and formulate a flow
optimization problem based on extended time expanded graph (ETEG) to maximize
the sum network utility. Then, we equivalently transform the flow optimization
problem on ETEG as a queue stability-related stochastic optimization problem.
An online algorithm is proposed to solve the problem in a slot-by-slot manner
by exploiting the Lyapunov optimization technique. Performance analysis shows
that the proposed algorithm achieves close-to-optimal network utility while
guaranteeing bounded queue occupancy. Extensive simulation results further
validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and evaluate the impacts of
various network parameters on the algorithm performance.

  Materials and Methods: We visually explore two large public datasets, to
determine how accurate the provided labels are and whether other subtle
problems exist. The ChestXray14 dataset contains 112,120 frontal chest films,
and the MURA dataset contains 40,561 upper limb radiographs. A subset of around
700 images from both datasets was reviewed by a board-certified radiologist,
and the quality of the original labels was determined.
  Results: The ChestXray14 labels did not accurately reflect the visual content
of the images, with positive predictive values mostly between 10% and 30% lower
than the values presented in the original documentation. There were other
significant problems, with examples of hidden stratification and label
disambiguation failure. The MURA labels were more accurate, but the original
normal/abnormal labels were inaccurate for the subset of cases with
degenerative joint disease, with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 82%.
  Conclusion: Visual inspection of images is a necessary component of
understanding large image datasets. We recommend that teams producing public
datasets should perform this important quality control procedure and include a
thorough description of their findings, along with an explanation of the data
generating procedures and labelling rules, in the documentation for their

majorly contributing to the prediction. However, these salience maps are
generally confounded, i.e., some salient regions are more predictive of
confounding variables (such as age) than the diagnosis. To avoid such
misinterpretation, we propose in this paper an approach that aims to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps that only highlight voxels predictive of the
diagnosis. The approach incorporates univariate statistical tests to identify
confounding effects within the intermediate features learned by ConvNet. The
influence from the subset of confounded features is then removed by a novel
partial back-propagation procedure. We use this two-step approach to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps extracted from synthetic and two real datasets.
These experiments reveal the potential of our visualization in producing
unbiased model-interpretation.

super-resolution (HSR) has recently drawn significant interest in hyperspectral
imaging for remote sensing. Presently there is very few work that studies the
theoretical recovery guarantees of CoSMF. This paper makes one such endeavor by
considering the CoSMF formulation by Wei et al., which, simply speaking, is
similar to coupled non-negative matrix factorization. Assuming no noise, we
show sufficient conditions under which the globably optimal solution to the
CoSMF problem is guaranteed to deliver certain recovery accuracies. Our
analysis suggests that sparsity and the pure-pixel (or separability) condition
play a hidden role in enabling CoSMF to achieve some good recovery

simulations, the triazine polymers have been shown to form particular
sequential stacks, have stable backbone-backbone interactions through hydrogen
bonding and $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions, and conserve their \emph{cis/trans}
conformations throughout the simulation. However, we do not know the effects of
having different side chains and backbone structures on the entire conformation

triazine polymers. For this reason, we investigate the role of non-covalent
interactions for different side chains and backbone structures on the

is a high energy barrier associated to the \emph{cis}-\emph{trans}

various conformations of triazine hexamers. To obtain rates and intermediate
conformations, we use the recently developed concurrent adaptive sampling (CAS)

ability of the backbone structure is critical for the triazine polymers to
self-assemble into nanorod-like structures, rather than that of the side
chains, which can help researchers design more robust materials.

pressures inside the collapsing star become insufficient to balance the pull of
gravity. The Physics of gravitational collapse of stars is well studied. Using
general relativistic techniques one can show that the final fate of such a
catastrophic collapse can be a black hole or a naked singularity, depending
upon the initial conditions of gravitational collapse. While stars are made of
baryonic matter whose collapse is well studied, there is good indirect evidence
that another type of matter, known as dark matter, plays an important role in
the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies. It
is estimated that some eighty-five percent of the total matter in the universe
is dark matter. Since the particle constituent of dark matter is not known yet,
the gravitational collapse of dark matter is less explored. Here we consider
first some basic properties of baryonic matter and dark matter collapse. Then
we discuss the final fate of gravitational collapse for different types of
matter fields and the nature of the singularity which can be formed as an
endstate of gravitational collapse. We then present a general relativistic
technique to form equilibrium configurations and argue that this can be thought
of as a general relativistic analog of the standard virialization process. We
suggest a modification, where the Top-Hat collapse model of primordial dark
matter halo formation is modified by using the general relativistic technique
of equilibrium. We also explain why this type of collapse process is more
likely to happen in dark matter fields.

vascular permeability, inflammation, tissue architecture, and biochemical
stimuli are missing. In this work, a microfluidic chip is designed and tested
to replicate in vitro key steps in the metastatic cascade. It comprises two
channels, resting on the same plane, connected via an array of rounded pillars
to form a permeable micro-membrane. One channel acts as a vascular compartment
and is coated by a fully confluent monolayer of endothelial cells, whereas the
other channel is filled with a mixture of matrigel and breast cancer cells
(MDA-MB-231) and reproduces the malignant tissue. The vascular permeability can
be finely modulated by inducing pro-inflammatory conditions in the tissue
compartment, which transiently opens up the tight junctions of endothelial
cells. Fresh medium flowing continuously in the vascular compartment is
sufficient to induce cancer cell intravasation at rates of 8 cells/day with an
average velocity of 0.5 um/min. On the other hand, the vascular adhesion and
extravasation of circulating cancer cells require TNF-a stimulation.
Extravasation occurs at lower rates with 4 cells/day and an average velocity of
0.1 um/min. Finally, the same chip is completely filled with matrigel and the
migration of cancer cells from one channel to the other is monitored over a
region of about 400 um. Invasion rates of 12 cells/day are documented upon
TNF-a stimulation. This work demonstrates that the proposed compartmentalized
microfluidic chip can efficiently replicate in vitro, under controlled
biophysical and biochemical conditions, the multiple key steps in the cancer
metastatic cascade.

adversarial examples, increase the prediction likelihood of a target class for

further optimized, even when it has already been wrongly classified with 100%
confidence, thus making the adversarial example even more difficult to detect.
For this kind of adversarial examples, which we refer to as over-optimized

clues on whether the data point at hand is adversarial or genuine. In this
context, we first discuss the masking effect of the softmax function for the

detecting over-optimized adversarial examples. To identify this type of

diminishes their ordering at ambient pressure. This ""fail-to-order"" quantum
spin liquid state then develops into an ordered state above 1GPa due to
weakened fluctuation accompanying the reduction of anion height and carrier
density. The ordering further benefits from the ferro-orbital order and shows
the observed enhancement around 1GPa. We further clarify the controversial

the bosonic AFM collective mode is heavily dressed by interactions with the

scrambling rates act as a measure of the ""degree of integrability"" of each

one $\lambda_L^{(F)} \sim \mathcal O(w^2) \,k_B T/\hbar$, where $T$ is the

the larger Lyapunov exponent is still parametrically smaller than the universal
upper bound of $\lambda_L=2\pi k_B T/\hbar$. We also compute the spatial spread
of chaos by the boson operator, whose low-energy propagator is highly
non-local. We find that this non-locality leads to a scrambled region that

First is the ARCH test using Nadayara-Watson kernel regression. Second is the
ARCH test using the polynomial approximation regression. The two approaches do
not require specification of the conditional mean and can adapt to various
nonlinear models, which are unknown a priori. Accordingly, they are robust to
misspecified conditional mean models. Simulation results show that ARCH tests
based on the polynomial approximation regression approach have better
statistical properties than ARCH tests using Nadayara-Watson kernel regression

studied using scaling relations or some regression analyses around some given
property. These approaches however do not take into account the complexity of
the physics of the galaxies and their diversification. Aims. We here
investigate the effect of cluster environment on the evolution of galaxies
through multivariate unsupervised classification and phylogenetic analyses
applied to two relatively large samples from the WINGS survey, one of cluster
members and one of field galaxies (2624 and 1476 objects respectively).
Methods. These samples are the largest ones ever analysed with a phylogenetic
approach in astrophysics. To be able to use the Maximum Parsimony (cladistics)
method, we first performed a pre-clustering in 300 clusters with a hierarchical
clustering technique, before applying it to these pre-clusters. All these
computations used seven parameters: B-V, log(Re), nV , $\mu$e , H$\beta$ ,
D4000 , log(M *). Results. We have obtained a tree for the combined samples and
do not find different evolutionary paths for cluster and field galaxies.
However, the cluster galaxies seem to have accelerated evolution in the sense
they are statistically more diversified from a primitive common ancestor. The
separate analyses show a hint for a slightly more regular evolution of the
variables for the cluster galaxies, which may indicate they are more
homogeneous as compared to field galaxies in the sense that the groups of the
latter appear to have more specific properties. On the tree for the cluster
galaxies, there is a separate branch which gathers rejunevated or stripped-off
groups of galaxies. This branch is clearly visible on the colour-magnitude
diagram, going back from the red sequence towards the blue one. On this
diagram, the distribution and the evolutionary paths of galaxies are strikingly
different for the two samples. Globally, we do not find any dominant variable
able to explain either the groups or the tree structures. Rather, co-evolution
appears everywhere, and could depend itself on environment or mass.
Conclusions. This study is another demonstration that unsupervised machine
learning is able to go beyond the simple scaling relations by taking into
account several properties together. The phylogenetic approach is invaluable to
trace the evolutionary scenarii and project them onto any biavariate diagram
without any a priori modelling. Our WINGS galaxies are all at low redshift, and
we now need to go to higher redshfits to find more primitve galaxies and
complete the map of the evolutionary paths of present day galaxies.

material for industrial-scale applications based on graphene monolayers. It
also holds promise for spintronics; despite being polycrystalline, spin
transport in CVD graphene has been measured over lengths up to 30 $\mu$m, which
is on par with the best measurements made in single-crystal graphene. These
results suggest that grain boundaries (GBs) in CVD graphene, while impeding
charge transport, may have little effect on spin transport. However, to date
very little is known about the true impact of disordered networks of GBs on
spin relaxation. Here, by using first-principles simulations, we derive an
effective tight-binding model of graphene GBs in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), which we then use to evaluate spin transport in realistic
morphologies of polycrystalline graphene. The spin diffusion length is found to
be independent of the grain size, and is determined only by the strength of the
substrate-induced SOC. This result is consistent with the D'yakonov-Perel'
mechanism of spin relaxation in the diffusive regime, but we find that it also
holds in the presence of quantum interference. These results clarify the role
played by GBs and demonstrate that the average grain size does not dictate the
upper limit for spin transport in CVD-grown graphene, a result of fundamental
importance for optimizing large-scale graphene-based spintronic devices.

corpus of untrimmed, unsegmented videos given a natural language query. Our
task poses unique challenges as a system must efficiently identify both the
relevant videos and localize the relevant moments in the videos. To address
these challenges, we propose SpatioTemporal Alignment with Language (STAL), a
model that represents a video moment as a set of regions within a series of
short video clips and aligns a natural language query to the moment's regions.
Our alignment cost compares variable-length language and video features using
symmetric squared Chamfer distance, which allows for efficient indexing and
retrieval of the video moments. Moreover, aligning language features to regions
within a video moment allows for finer alignment compared to methods that
extract only an aggregate feature from the entire video moment. We evaluate our
approach on two recently proposed datasets for temporal localization of moments
in video with natural language (DiDeMo and Charades-STA) extended to our video
corpus moment retrieval setting. We show that our STAL re-ranking model
outperforms the recently proposed Moment Context Network on all criteria across
all datasets on our proposed task, obtaining relative gains of 37% - 118% for

building stage, we address the problem of unordered point cloud data using a

characterizes the relationship between a point and its one-hop neighbor in a

of a point will grow by taking its relationship with one-hop neighbor points
into account iteratively. Furthermore, to control the rapid dimension growth of
the attribute vector associated with a point, we use the Saab transform to
reduce the attribute dimension in each PointHop unit. In the classification and
ensemble stage, we feed the feature vector obtained from multiple PointHop
units to a classifier. We explore ensemble methods to improve the

the effect of heating rate on the phase transformation temperatures and to
select an appropriate inter-critical temperature for final heat treatments. A
thorough qualitative and quantitative microstructural characterization of the
heat treated samples is performed using a wide range of characterization
techniques. A complex multiphase, hierarchical microstructure consisting of
ferritic matrix with embedded martensite and retained austenite is formed after
all applied heat treatments. In turn, the ferritic matrix contains
recrystallized and non-recrystallized grains. It is demonstrated that the
ultrafast heating generally results in finer microstructure compared to the
conventional heating independently on the soaking time. There is a significant
effect of the soaking time on the volume fraction of martensite of the
ultrafast heated material, while in the samples heated with conventional
heating rate it remains relatively unchanged during soaking. Recrystallization,
recovery and phase transformations occurring during soaking are discussed with
respect to the applied heating rate.

leading the search for dark matter particles with masses above $\sim$ 5
GeV/c$^2$, but have limited sensitivity to lighter masses because of the small
momentum transfer in dark matter-nucleus elastic scattering. However, there is
an irreducible contribution from inelastic processes accompanying the elastic
scattering, which leads to the excitation and ionization of the recoiling atom
(the Migdal effect) or the emission of a Bremsstrahlung photon. In this letter,
we report on a probe of low-mass dark matter with masses down to about 85
MeV/c$^2$ by looking for electronic recoils induced by the Migdal effect and
Bremsstrahlung, using data from the XENON1T experiment. Besides the approach of
detecting both scintillation and ionization signals, we exploit an approach
that uses ionization signals only, which allows for a lower detection
threshold. This analysis significantly enhances the sensitivity of XENON1T to
light dark matter previously beyond its reach.

demonstrated that the differential version of $KMR$ prescription and the

the negative-discontinuous $UPDF$ with the ordinary parton distribution
functions ($PDF$) as the input, which leads to a sizable effect on the
calculation of $PSF$. In the present work, we use the new $MMHT2014$-$LO$-$PDF$
as the input and focus on the $UPDF$ behaviors as was raised by $GBS$.
  The resulting $PSF$ and $PLSF$ are compared with the $MSTW2008$-$LO$-$PDF$
and $MRST99$-$PDF$ and the 2014 data given by the $ZEUS$ and $H1$
collaborations. The calculated $PSF$ and $PLSF$ based on the integral
prescription of the $KMR$-$UPDF$ with the $AOC$ and the ordinary $PDF$ as the
input are reasonably consistent with the experimental data. Therefore, they are
approximately independent to the $PDF$ (no need to impose cutoff on the $PDF$).
  At very small $x$ regions because of the excess of gluons in the
$MMHT2014$-$LO$-$PDF$ and $MSTW2008$-$LO$-$PDF$, an increase in $PSF$ and
$PLSF$ is achieved. Finally, according to the $GBS$ report the differential
version by using the cutoff independent $PDF$ produces results far from the
experimental data.

called LP complementation, which resembles many properties of LP duality. Given
a maximisation (resp.~minimisation) LP $P$, we define its complement $Q$ as a
specific minimisation (resp.~maximisation) LP with the same objective function
as $P$. Our central result is the LP complementation theorem, that establishes
the following relationship between the optimal value $\text{Opt}(P)$ of $P$ and
the optimal value $\text{Opt}(Q)$ of its complement:
$\frac{1}{\text{Opt}(P)}+\frac{1}{\text{Opt}(Q)}=1$. The LP complementation
operation can be applied if and only if $\text{Opt}(P) > 1$.
  We then apply LP complementation to hypergraphs. For every hypergraph
$H=(V,E)$, its dual is $H^*$ and we call $\overline{H}=(V,\{V\setminus e : e\in
E\})$ the complement of $H$. For the covering LP $K(H)$ we obtain $\frac{1}{
\text{Opt}( K(H^*) ) }+\frac{1}{\text{Opt}( K(\overline{H}) ) } = 1$ (and
similarly for packing, matching and transversal LPs).
  We then consider \emph{fractional graph theory}. We prove that the LP for the
\Define{fractional in-dominating number} of a digraph $D$ is the complement of
the LP for the \Define{fractional total out-dominating number} of the digraph
complement of $D$. We also establish that the fractional matching number of a
matroid coincides with its edge toughness.
  Finally, we introduce the problem \text{Vertex Cover with Budget (VCB)}: for
a graph $G$ and a positive integer $b$, what is the maximum number $t_b$ of
vertex covers $S_1, \dots, S_{t_b}$ of $G$, such that every vertex appears in
at most $b$ vertex covers? We relate \text{VCB} with the LP $Q_G$ for the
fractional chromatic number of $G$: as $b \to \infty$, $t_b \sim t_f \cdot b$,
where $t_f$ is the optimal value of the complement LP of $Q_G$.

deg$^2$ of the north and south regions of Cygnus X, and totally 174 C$^{18}$O
clumps are identified using the dendrogram method. Assuming a distance of 1.4
kpc, these clumps have radii of 0.2-1 pc, velocity dispersions of
$<2.2~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, gas masses of 30-3000 $M_\odot$, and H$_2$ densities
of (0.2-5.5)$\times10^4~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. We confirm that the C$^{18}$O clumps
in the north region have a higher H$_2$ density than those in the south region,
supporting the existence of a difference in the evolution stages, consistent
with the star formation activity of these regions. The difference in the clump
properties of the star-forming and starless clumps is also confirmed by the
radius, velocity dispersion, gas mass, and H$_2$ density. The average virial
ratio of 0.3 supports that these clumps are gravitationally bound. The
C$^{18}$O clump mass function shows two spectral index components,
$\alpha=-1.4$ in 55-140 $M_\odot$ and $\alpha=-2.1$ in $>140~M_\odot$, which
are consistent with the low- and intermediate-mass parts of the Kroupa's
initial mass function. The spectral index in the star-forming clumps in
$>140~M_\odot$ is consistent with that of the starless clumps in 55-140
$M_\odot$, suggesting that the latter will evolve into star-forming clumps
while retaining the gas accretion. Assuming a typical star formation efficiency
of molecular clumps (10%), about ten C$^{18}$O clumps having a gas mass of
$>10^3~M_\odot$ will evolve into open clusters containing one or more OB stars.

stripping (RPS) in the galaxy cluster A1758N, we investigate the properties of
other galaxies suspected to undergo RPS in this equal-mass, post-collision
merger. Exploiting constraints derived from Hubble Space Telescope images and
Keck longslit spectroscopy, our finding of apparent debris trails and
dramatically enhanced star formation rates in an additional seven RPS
candidates support the hypothesis that RPS, and hence rapid galaxy evolution in
high-density environments, is intricately linked to cluster collisions.
Unexpectedly, we find the vast majority of RPS candidates in A1758N to be
moving toward us, and in a shared direction as projected on the plane of the
sky. We hypothesize that this directional bias is the result of two successive
events: (1) the quenching, during and after the first core passage, of star
formation in galaxies with an approximately isotropic velocity distribution
within the central region of the merger, and (2) RPS events triggered in
late-type galaxies falling into the merging system along a filament, possibly
enhanced by a shock front expanding into the outskirts of the south-eastern
subcluster. Since this explanation implies that the merger axis of A1758N must
be significantly inclined with respect to the plane of the sky, our findings
open the possibility of RPS events becoming important diagnostic tools to
constrain the geometry of cluster collisions that, due to the orientation of
the merger axis, lack the classic observational signatures of face-on mergers.

Being predicted
about a century ago, they are now accepted as astrophysical reality by most of
the scientific community. Only recently more direct evidence of their existence
has been found - the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers
and of the shadow of a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy.
Astrophysical black holes are typically embedded in an active environment which
is affected by the strong gravity. When the environmental material emits
radiation, this radiation may carry imprints of the black hole that is hosting
the radiation source. In order to understand the physical processes that take
place in the close neighbourhood of astrophysical black holes, numerical
methods and simulations play an essential role. This is simply because the
dynamical evolution and the radiative interaction are far too complex in order
to allow for an analytic solution of the physical equations. A huge progress
has been made over the last decade(s) in the numerical code development, as
well as in the computer power that is needed to run these codes. This review
tries to summarize the basic questions and methods that are involved in the
undertaking of investigating the astrophysics of black holes by numerical
means. It is intended for a non-expert audience interested in an overview over
this broad field. The review comes along without equations and thus without a
detailed expert discussion of the underlying physical processes or numerical
specifics. Instead, it intends to illustrate the richness of the field and to
motivate for further reading. The review puts some emphasis on
magnetohydrodynamic simulations, but also touches radiation transfer and merger
simulations, in particular pointing out differences in these approaches.

from an image by pure end-to-end learning. It is twofold: 1) Multiple text
sequences recognition. Each image may contain multiple text sequences of
different content, location and orientation, and we try to recognize all the
text sequences contained in the image. 2) Pure end-to-end (PEE) learning.We
solve the problem in a pure end-to-end learning way where each training image
is labeled by only text transcripts of all contained sequences, without any
geometric annotations. Most existing works recognize multiple text sequences
from an image in a non-end-to-end (NEE) or quasi-end-to-end (QEE) way, in which
each image is trained with both text transcripts and text locations.Only
recently, a PEE method was proposed to recognize text sequences from an image
where the text sequence was split to several lines in the image. However, it
cannot be directly applied to recognizing multiple text sequences from an
image. So in this paper, we propose a pure end-to-end learning method to
recognize multiple text sequences from an image. Our method directly learns
multiple sequences of probability distribution conditioned on each input image,
and outputs multiple text transcripts with a well-designed decoding strategy.To
evaluate the proposed method, we constructed several datasets mainly based on
an existing public dataset andtwo real application scenarios. Experimental
results show that the proposed method can effectively recognize multiple text
sequences from images, and outperforms CTC-based and attention-based baseline
methods.

general relativistic toy model to achieve such a purpose. We consider a
relativistic gravitational collapse that begins from physically reasonable and
non-singular initial conditions and that tends to an equilibrium configuration
in asymptotic time. The matching of different spacetime regions is explicitly
demonstrated to establish the feasibility of the model. This helps us
understand better how the formation of galaxy-like objects and dark matter
halos are likely to develop as the universe evolves, using a general
relativistic technique. While the toy model we present here uses a somewhat
simplistic collapse framework, this, however, has the potential to develop into
a more realistic scenario, as we have noted. As we point out, the attractive
feature here is, we have explicitly demonstrated that equilibrium

and, hence, requires the introduction of regularization. We study here a double
regularization scheme, in which the number of colors available to each variable
is reduced, and interaction networks are made sparse. To achieve this color
compression scheme, only Potts states with large empirical frequency (exceeding
some threshold) are explicitly modeled on each site, while the others are
grouped into a single state. We benchmark the performances of this mixed
regularization approach, with two inference algorithms, the Adaptive Cluster
Expansion (ACE) and the PseudoLikelihood Maximization (PLM) on synthetic data
obtained by sampling disordered Potts models on an Erdos-Renyi random graphs.
We show in particular that color compression does not affect the quality of
reconstruction of the parameters corresponding to high-frequency symbols, while
drastically reducing the number of the other parameters and thus the

possibility of using clustering algorithms to separate stellar populations with
distinct chemical patterns. Star clusters are likely the most chemically
homogeneous populations in the Galaxy, and therefore any practical approach to
identifying distinct stellar populations should at least be able to separate
clusters from each other. We applied eight clustering algorithms combined with
four dimensionality reduction strategies to automatically distinguish stellar
clusters using chemical abundances of 13 elements. Our sample includes 18
stellar clusters with a total of 453 stars. We use statistical tests showing
that some pairs of clusters are indistinguishable from each other when chemical
abundances from the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) are
used. However, for most clusters we are able to automatically assign membership
with metric scores similar to previous works. The confusion level of the
automatically selected clusters is consistent with statistical tests that
demonstrate the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing all the clusters from
each other. These statistical tests and confusion levels establish a limit for
the prospect of blindly identifying stars born in the same cluster based solely
on chemical abundances. We find that some of the algorithms we explored are
capable of blindly identify stellar populations with similar ages and chemical
distributions in the APOGEE data. Because some stellar clusters are chemically
indistinguishable, our study supports the notion of extending weak chemical
tagging that involves families of clusters instead of individual clusters

radiative transfer problems in astronomy, especially in a fully general 3D
geometry. A crucial concept in any Monte Carlo radiative transfer code is the
random generation of the next interaction location. In polarised Monte Carlo
radiative transfer with aligned non-spherical grains, the nature of dichroism
complicates the concept of optical depth. Aims: We investigate in detail the
relation between optical depth and the optical properties and density of the
attenuating medium in polarised Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes that take
into account dichroic extinction. Methods: Based on solutions for the radiative
transfer equation, we discuss the optical depth scale in polarised radiative
transfer with spheroidal grains. We compare the dichroic optical depth to the
extinction and total optical depth scale. Results: In a dichroic medium, the
optical depth is not equal to the usual extinction optical depth, nor to the
total optical depth. For representative values of the optical properties of
dust grains, the dichroic optical depth can differ from the extinction or total
optical depth by several ten percent. A closed expression for the dichroic
optical depth cannot be given, but it can be derived efficiently through an
algorithm that is based on the analytical result corresponding to elongated
grains with a uniform grain alignment. Conclusions: Optical depth is more
complex in dichroic media than in systems without dichroic attenuation, and
this complexity needs to be considered when generating random free path lengths
in Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. There is no benefit in using
approximations instead of the dichroic optical depth.

an observational study the treatment attribution law is unknown; however, the

provided a well-specified model is available. An intervention is specified by
the treatment attribution law, which is thus known. Simple interventions will
simply randomize the attribution of the treatment; interventions that take into

interventions can be defined by a risk function $R^{\intr}=\Ee_{\intr}[L(\bar

loss function, and contrasts between risk functions for different strategies

optimal or sub-optimal strategies; in particular we can find optimal parametric

two photons at about 96 GeV with a local significance of $2.8\sigma$. While it
is too early to say whether this will stand the test of time, such a resonance
can easily be accommodated in many extensions of the Standard Model (SM). The
more challenging part is to tune such an extension so that the required number
of diphoton events is reproduced. Assuming that the new resonance is a scalar,
we propose that the signal may come either from an ultraviolet complete model
with vectorial quarks, or a model involving gluon-scalar and photon-scalar
effective operators. We then incorporate this portal to several extensions of

investigate how the existence of such a scalar resonance affects the parameter
space of such models. As expected, we find that with such a scalar, the
parameter space gets more constrained and hence, more tractable. We show how
significant constraints can be placed on the parameter space, not only from
direct dark matter searches or LHC data but also from theoretical
considerations like scattering unitarity or stability of the potential, and
discuss some novel features of the allowed parameter space.

limits of both the fixed angle or Gross regime (GR) and the fixed momentum
transfer or Regge regime (RR). We calculated high energy string scattering
amplitudes (SSA) at arbitrary mass levels for both regimes. We discovered the
infinite linear relations among fixed angle string amplitudes and the infinite
recurrence relations among Regge string amplitudes. The linear relations we
obtained in the GR corrected the saddle point calculations by Gross, Gross and
Mende. In addition, for the high energy closed string scatterings, our results
differ from theirs by an oscillating prefactor which was crucial to recover the
KLT relation valid for all energies. We showed that all the high energy string
amplitudes can be solved by the linear or recurrence relations so that all the
string amplitudes can be expressed in terms of a single string amplitude. We
further found that, at each mass level, the ratios among the fixed angle
amplitudes can be extracted from the Regge string scattering amplitudes.
Finally, we review the recent developments on the discovery of infinite number
of recurrence relations valid for all energies among Lauricella SSA. The
symmetries or relations among SSA at various limits obtained previously can be
exactly reproduced. It leads us to argue that the known SL(K+3,C) dynamical
symmetry of the Lauricella function maybe crucial to probe spacetime symmetry
of string theory.

simulated soundscape in order to verify the feasibility of intraspecies

regime. However, most of these systems have a fundamental lower collision
energy limit which is higher than this s-wave regime. This limit arises from
the time-dependant trapping potential of the ion, the Paul trap. In this work,
we studied both theoretically and experimentally, the way the Paul trap
parameters affect the energy distribution of an ion that is immersed in a bath
of ultra-cold atoms. Heating rates and energy distributions of the ion are
calculated for various trap parameters by a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
that takes into account the attractive atom-ion potential. The deviation of the
energy distribution from a thermal one is discussed. Using the MD simulation,
the heating dynamics for different atom-ion combinations is also investigated.
In addition, we performed measurements of the heating rates of a ground-state
cooled $\ ^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion that is immersed in an ultra-cold cloud of $\
^{87}$Rb atoms, over a wide range of trap parameters, and compare our results
to the MD simulation. Both the simulation and the experiment reveal no
significant change in the heating for different parameters of the trap.
However, in the experiment a slightly higher global heating is observed,
relative to the simulation.

process discovery, conformance checking, machine learning on event data.
However, in very few cases scalability has been a target, prioritizing the

in-memory data structures, more performant algorithms is a strictly incumbent
need. In this paper, we propose the usage of mainstream columnar storages and
dataframes to increase the scalability of process mining. These can replace the
classic event log structures in most tasks, but require completely different
implementations with regards to mainstream process mining algorithms.
Dataframes will be defined, some algorithms on such structures will be

obvious low coronal signature. These CMEs are characteristically slower events,
but can still be geoeffective and affect space weather at Earth. Therefore,
understanding the science underpinning these eruptions will greatly improve our
ability to detect and, eventually, forecast them. We present a study of two
stealth CMEs analysed using advanced image processing techniques that reveal
their faint signatures in observations from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
imagers onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
spacecraft. The different viewpoints given by these spacecraft provide the
opportunity to study each eruption from above and the side contemporaneously.
For each event, EUV and magnetogram observations were combined to reveal the
coronal structure that erupted. For one event, the observations indicate the
presence of a magnetic flux rope before the CME's fast rise phase. We found
that both events originated in active regions and are likely to be sympathetic
CMEs triggered by a nearby eruption. We discuss the physical processes that
occurred in the time leading up to the onset of each stealth CME and conclude
that these eruptions are part of the low-energy and velocity tail of a

  Monotone Functions",,,"10.1016/j.tcs.2021.03.025",,"cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Pseudo-Boolean monotone functions are unimodal functions which are trivial to
optimize for some hillclimbers, but are challenging for a surprising number of
evolutionary algorithms (EAs). A general trend is that EAs are efficient if
parameters like the mutation rate are set conservatively, but may need
exponential time otherwise. In particular, it was known that the $(1+1)$-EA and
the $(1+\lambda)$-EA can optimize every monotone function in pseudolinear time
if the mutation rate is $c/n$ for some $c<1$, but they need exponential time
for some monotone functions for $c>2.2$. The second part of the statement was
also known for the $(\mu+1)$-EA. In this paper we show that the first statement
does not apply to the $(\mu+1)$-EA. More precisely, we prove that for every
constant $c>0$ there is a constant integer $\mu_0$ such that the $(\mu+1)$-EA
with mutation rate $c/n$ and population size $\mu_0\le\mu\le n$ needs
superpolynomial time to optimize some monotone functions. Thus, increasing the
population size by just a constant has devastating effects on the performance.
This is in stark contrast to many other benchmark functions on which increasing
the population size either increases the performance significantly, or affects
performance mildly. The reason why larger populations are harmful lies in the
fact that larger populations may temporarily decrease selective pressure on
parts of the population. This allows unfavorable mutations to accumulate in
single individuals and their descendants. If the population moves sufficiently
fast through the search space, such unfavorable descendants can become
ancestors of future generations, and the bad mutations are preserved.
Remarkably, this effect only occurs if the population renews itself
sufficiently fast, which can only happen far away from the optimum. This is
counter-intuitive since usually optimization gets harder as we approach the
optimum.

rate depending on the dimensionality and the multiplication rate $\mu$ at the
fertile site. When $d>d_c=2$, the number of walkers may remain finite forever
for any $\mu$; it surely remains finite when $\mu\leq \mu_d$. We determine
$\mu_d$ and show that $\langle\mathcal{N}(t)\rangle$ grows exponentially if
$\mu>\mu_d$. The distribution of the total number of walkers remains broad when
$d\leq 2$, and also when $d>2$ and $\mu>\mu_d$. We compute $\langle
\mathcal{N}^m\rangle$ explicitly for small $m$, and show how to determine
higher moments. In the critical regime, $\langle \mathcal{N}\rangle$ grows as
$\sqrt{t}$ for $d=3$, $t/\ln t$ for $d=4$, and $t$ for $d>4$. Higher moments
grow anomalously, $\langle \mathcal{N}^m\rangle\sim \langle

$\langle \mathcal{N}^m\rangle\sim \langle \mathcal{N}\rangle^{m}$, in the
exponential phase. The distribution of the number of walkers in the critical
regime is asymptotically stationary and universal, viz. it is independent of
the spatial dimension. Interactions between walkers may drastically change the
behavior. For random walks with exclusion, if $d>2$, there is again a critical
multiplication rate, above which $\langle\mathcal{N}(t)\rangle$ grows linearly

scattering by large, disordered ensembles of non-spherical particles
incorporated in stratified media, including when the particles are in close
vicinity to each other, to planar interfaces and/or to localized light sources.
The method consists in finding a small set of fictitious polarizable elements
-- or numerical dipoles -- that quantitatively reproduces the field scattered
by an individual particle for any excitation and at an arbitrary distance from
the particle surface. The set of numerical dipoles is described by a global
polarizability matrix that is determined numerically by solving an inverse
problem relying on fullwave simulations. The latter are classical and may be
performed with any Maxwell's equations solver. Spatial non-locality is an
important feature of the numerical dipoles set, providing additional degrees of
freedom compared to classical coupled dipoles to reconstruct complex scattered
fields. Once the polarizability matrix describing scattering by an individual
particle is determined, the multiple scattering problem by ensembles of such
particles in stratified media can be solved using a Green tensor formalism and
only few numerical dipoles, thereby with a low physical memory usage, even for
dense systems in close vicinity to interfaces. The performance of the method is
studied with the example of large high-aspect-ratio high-index dielectric
cylinders. The method is easy to implement and may offer new possibilities for
the study of complex nanostructured surfaces, which are becoming widespread in
emerging photonic technologies.

To date, both
simple (linear discriminant analysis) and complex (deep neural network) machine
learning methods have been utilized to identify schizophrenia based on
functional connectivity features. The existing simple methods need two separate
steps (i.e., feature extraction and classification) to achieve the
identification, which disables simultaneous tuning for the best feature
extraction and classifier training. The complex methods integrate two steps and
can be simultaneously tuned to achieve optimal performance, but these methods
require a much larger amount of data for model training. Methods: To overcome
the aforementioned drawbacks, we proposed a multi-kernel capsule network
(MKCapsnet), which was developed by considering the brain anatomical structure.
Kernels were set to match with partition sizes of brain anatomical structure in
order to capture interregional connectivities at the varying scales. With the
inspiration of widely-used dropout strategy in deep learning, we developed
vector dropout in the capsule layer to prevent overfitting of the model.
Results: The comparison results showed that the proposed method outperformed
the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we compared performances using different
parameters and illustrated the routing process to reveal characteristics of the
proposed method. Conclusion: MKCapsnet is promising for schizophrenia
identification. Significance: Our study not only proposed a multi-kernel
capsule network but also provided useful information in the parameter setting,
which is informative for further studies using a capsule network for
neurophysiological signal classification.

to first order, robust to symmetry-breaking perturbations. We then describe how
these conditions can be satisfied by the interplay between several elements:
interactions, local dephasing and the presence of a strong dynamical symmetry -
an operator which guarantees long-time non-stationary dynamics. These elements
cause the formation of entanglement and off-diagonal long-range order which
drive the synchronised response of the system. To illustrate these ideas we
present two central examples: a chain of quadratically dephased spin-1s and the
many-body charge-dephased Hubbard model. In both cases perfect phase-locking
occurs throughout the system, regardless of the specific microscopic parameters
or initial states. Furthermore, when these systems are perturbed, their
non-linear responses elicit long-lived signatures of both phase and

thermally-induced hopping mechanism of the H$^+$ and OH$^-$ ions linked to
vacancies. In part II this hopping mechanism is further explored and confronted
to the small Hall mobilities of the ions, still unexplained with mainstream

charged vacancies with the opposite charge of the ion (H$^+$VL and OH$^-$VD) or
neutral vacancies (H$^+$V and OH$^-$V). These complexes are responsible for the

of these complexes. The second type of complexes contains a vacancy charged
similar as the ion (H$^+$VD and OH$^-$VL). This second type is responsible for

not altering the electric polarisation of the lattice structure. They are

is usually difficult to be largely tuned in the entire alloy concentrations by
external approaches. Some alloys that were supposed to have promising physical
properties could turn out to be much less useful because of their poor SS,
e.g., the case for monolayer BNC [(BN)1-x(C2)x] alloys. Until now, an effective
approach on significantly enhancing SS of (BN)1-x(C2)x in the entire x is still
lacking. In this article, a novel mechanism of selective orbital coupling
between high energy wrong-bond states and surface states mediated by the
specific substrate has been proposed to stabilize the wrong-bonds and in turn
significantly enhance the SS of (BN)1-x(C2)x alloys. Surprisingly, we
demonstrate that five ordered alloys, exhibiting variable direct quasi-particle
bandgaps from 1.35 to 3.99 eV, can spontaneously be formed at different x when
(BN)1-x(C2)x is grown on hcp-phase Cr. Interestingly, the optical transitions
around the band edges in these ordered alloys, accompanied by largely tunable
exciton binding energies of ~1 eV at different x, are significantly strong due
to their unique band structures. Importantly, the disordered (BN)1-x(C2)x
alloys, exhibiting fully tunable bandgaps from 0 to ~6 eV in the entire x, can
be formed on Cr substrate at the miscibility temperature of ~1200 K, which is
greatly reduced compared to that of 4500~5600 K in free-standing form or on
other substrates. Our discovery not only may resolve the long-standing SS
problem of BNC alloys, but also could significantly extend the applications of
BNC alloys for various optoelectronic applications.

detailed data on the capacity of individual transmission lines. However, these
data are often unavailable to researchers. As a result, line limits are often
modelled by assuming they are proportional to some average load. Little
research exists, however, to support this assumption as being realistic. In
this paper, we analyse the proportional-loading (PL) approach and compare it to
two linear models that use voltage and initial power flow as variables. In
conducting this modelling, we test the ability of artificial line limits to
model true line limits, the damage done during an attack and the order in which
edges are lost. we also test how accurately these methods rank the relative
performance of different attack strategies. We find that the linear models are
the top-performing method or close to the top in all tests. In comparison, the
tolerance value that produces the best PL limits changes depending on the test.
The PL approach was a particularly poor fit when the line tolerance was less
than two, which is the most commonly used value range in cascading-failure
research. We also find indications that the accuracy of modelling line limits
does not indicate how well a model will represent grid collapse. In addition,
we find evidence that the network's topology can be used to estimate the
system's true mean loading. The findings of this paper provide an understanding
of the weaknesses of the PL approach and offer an alternative method of
line-limit modelling.

our design simplifies to standard network operations of classical CNNs, but
under consideration of north-aligned kernel convolutions for features on the

up-to a level-8 resolution mesh (equivalent to 640 x 1024 equirectangular

standard feature weights, pretrained on perspective data, can be directly
transferred with only small need for weight refinement. In our evaluation our

machine learning (ML) algorithms, a topic that is equally important to the
construction of these algorithms, in particular in the context of cyberphysical
security design. The literature is full of nonparametric methods to estimate a
statistic from just one available dataset through resampling techniques, e.g.,
jackknife, bootstrap and cross validation (CV). Special statistics of great
interest are the error rate and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of a
classification rule. The importance of these resampling methods stems from the
fact that they require no knowledge about the probability distribution of the
data or the construction details of the ML algorithm. This chapter provides a
concise review of this literature to establish a coherent theoretical framework
for these methods that can estimate both the error rate (a one-sample
statistic) and the AUC (a two-sample statistic). The resampling methods are
usually computationally expensive, because they rely on repeating the training
and testing of a ML algorithm after each resampling iteration. Therefore, the
practical applicability of some of these methods may be limited to the
traditional ML algorithms rather than the very computationally demanding
approaches of the recent deep neural networks (DNN). In the field of
cyberphysical security, many applications generate structured (tabular) data,
which can be fed to all traditional ML approaches. This is in contrast to the
DNN approaches, which favor unstructured data, e.g., images, text, voice, etc.;
hence, the relevance of this chapter to this field.%

complexity of equilibrium approximation problems. However, in this paper, we
reveal that they have a conceptual flaw, namely that the solution concept is
not monotonic. By this we mean that if $\varepsilon < \varepsilon'$, then an
$\varepsilon$-approximate solution for a certain generalized circuit is not
necessarily also an $\varepsilon'$-approximate solution. The reason for this
non-monotonicity is the way Boolean operations are modeled. We illustrate that
non-monotonicity creates subtle technical issues in prior work that require
intricate additional arguments to circumvent. To eliminate this problem, we
show that the Boolean gates are a redundant feature: one can simulate stronger,
monotonic versions of the Boolean gates using the other gate types. Arguing at
the level of these stronger Boolean gates eliminates all of the aforementioned
issues in a natural way. We hope that our results will enable new studies of
sub-classes of generalized circuits and enabler simpler and more natural

(5261) Eureka, its family of 8 asteroids and the family-less Trojans (101429)
1998 VF31 & (121514) 1999 UJ7. We model the population evolution as a
birth-death random process and assume it is in a steady state. We then simulate
the discovery of Trojans to-date and find that family members of 101429 and
121514, if they exist, are intrinsically more difficult to detect than
Eureka's. Their non-discovery can be used as evidence of their non-existence
only under the assumption that their brightness relative to the parent asteroid
is similar to that in the Eureka family. To find out how efficiently Mars
Trojans are lost from the Trojan clouds due to the Yarkovsky effect, we carry
out dynamical simulations of test particles originating from these parent
bodies. We find that objects originating from Eureka and 121514 begin escaping
after ~1 Gyr, but that those from 101429 are already lost by that time,
probably due to that asteroid's proximity to an eccentricity-type secular
resonance within Mars's co-orbital region. This is the likely cause behind the
absence of Trojans in the orbital vicinity of 101429. In contrast, the solitary
status of 121514 points to an intrinsic inability of the asteroid to produce
YORPlets during the most recent ~20% of the solar system's history, a finding
potentially related to 121514's present, low angular momentum rotational state,
unless the Eureka family formed rapidly during a single fission event.

Color Mapping Generative Adversarial Networks (ColorMapGAN), which can generate
fake training images that are semantically exactly the same as training images,

images to fine-tune the already trained classifier. Contrary to the existing
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the generator in ColorMapGAN does not
have any convolutional or pooling layers. It learns to transform the colors of
the training data to the colors of the test data by performing only one
element-wise matrix multiplication and one matrix addition operations. Thanks
to the architecturally simple but powerful design of ColorMapGAN, the proposed
framework outperforms the existing approaches with a large margin in terms of

approach similar to the 2015 one, with different approximations at low and high
multipoles, and implementing several methodological and analysis refinements.
With more realistic simulations, and better correction and modelling of
systematics, we can now make full use of the High Frequency Instrument
polarization data. The low-multipole 100x143 GHz EE cross-spectrum constrains
the reionization optical-depth parameter $\tau$ to better than 15% (in
combination with with the other low- and high-$\ell$ likelihoods). We also
update the 2015 baseline low-$\ell$ joint TEB likelihood based on the Low
Frequency Instrument data, which provides a weaker $\tau$ constraint. At high
multipoles, a better model of the temperature-to-polarization leakage and
corrections for the effective calibrations of the polarization channels
(polarization efficiency or PE) allow us to fully use the polarization spectra,
improving the constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters by 20 to 30% compared
to TT-only constraints. Tests on the modelling of the polarization demonstrate
good consistency, with some residual modelling uncertainties, the accuracy of
the PE modelling being the main limitation. Using our various tests,
simulations, and comparison between different high-$\ell$ implementations, we
estimate the consistency of the results to be better than the 0.5$\sigma$
level. Minor curiosities already present before (differences between $\ell$<800
and $\ell$>800 parameters or the preference for more smoothing of the $C_\ell$
peaks) are shown to be driven by the TT power spectrum and are not
significantly modified by the inclusion of polarization. Overall, the legacy
Planck CMB likelihoods provide a robust tool for constraining the cosmological
model and represent a reference for future CMB observations. (Abridged)

evaluate the novel use of visual entropy as a measure of shape that allows us
to construct an ordered scale of glyphs for use in representing both
uncertainty and value in 2D and 3D environments. Method: We use sample entropy
as a numerical measure of visual entropy to construct a set of glyphs using R
and Blender which vary in their complexity. Results: an exact binomial analysis
of a pairwise comparison of the glyphs shows a majority of participants (n =
87) ordered each glyph as predicted by the visual entropy score with large
effect size (Cohen's g > 0.25). We also evaluate whether the glyphs effectively
represent uncertainty using a signal detection method in a search task.
Participants (n = 15) were able to find glyphs representing uncertainty with
high sensitivity and low error rates. Conclusion: visual entropy is a
successful novel approach to representing ordered data and provides a channel
that can allow the uncertainty of a measure to be presented alongside its mean
value.

investigation of climate response to perturbations. In this respect, it is
crucial to determine what the linear response of a system is to small

we use the transfer operator formalism to study the response and sensitivity of
a dynamical system undergoing perturbations. By projecting the transfer
operator onto a suitable finite dimensional vector space, one is able to obtain
matrix representations which determine finite Markov processes. Further, using
perturbation theory for Markov matrices, it is possible to determine the linear
and nonlinear response of the system given a prescribed forcing. Here, we
suggest a methodology which puts the scope on the evolution law of densities

in one dimension in the presence of a memory function that is the sum of two
exponentials with different memory times $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$. Our Langevin
simulations for the special case where both exponentials contribute equally to
the total friction show that the barrier crossing time becomes independent of
the longer memory time if at least one of the two memory times is larger than
the intrinsic diffusion time. When we associate memory effects with coupled
degrees of freedom that are orthogonal to a one-dimensional reaction
coordinate, this counterintuitive result shows that the faster orthogonal
degrees of freedom dominate barrier-crossing kinetics in the non-Markovian
limit and that the slower orthogonal degrees become negligible, quite contrary
to the standard time-scale separation assumption and with important
consequences for the proper setup of coarse-graining procedures in the
non-Markovian case. By asymptotic matching and symmetry arguments, we construct
a crossover formula for the barrier crossing time that is valid for general
multi-exponential memory kernels. This formula can be used to estimate
barrier-crossing times for general memory functions for high friction, i.e. in
the overdamped regime, as well as for low friction, i.e. in the inertial
regime. Typical examples where our results are important include protein
folding in the high-friction limit and chemical reactions such as
proton-transfer reactions in the low-friction limit.

revealed that the bubble shape becomes more complex, quantified by an
increasing number of transient bubble tips, with increasing flow rate.
Eventually the bubble changes topology, breaking into two or more distinct
entities with non-trivial dynamics. We demonstrate that qualitatively similar
behaviour to the experiments is exhibited by a previously established,
depth-averaged mathematical model; a consequence of the model's intricate
solution structure. For the bubble volumes studied, a stable asymmetric bubble
exists for all flow rates of interest, whilst a second stable solution branch
develops above a critical flow rate and transitions between symmetric and
asymmetric shapes. The region of bistability is bounded by two Hopf
bifurcations on the second branch. By developing a method for a numerical
weakly nonlinear stability analysis we show that unstable periodic orbits
emanate from the Hopf bifurcation at the lower flow rate and, moreover, that

observed by the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS). The
proposed calibration method has four steps: (i) definition of a high-quality
set of calibration stars using Gaia information and available 3D dust maps;
(ii) anchoring of the J-PLUS gri passbands to the Pan-STARRS photometric
solution, accounting for the variation of the calibration with the position of
the sources on the CCD; (iii) homogenization of the photometry in the other
nine J-PLUS filters using the dust de-reddened instrumental stellar locus in (X
- r) versus (g - i) colours, where X is the filter to calibrate. The zero point
variation along the CCD in these filters was estimated with the distance to the
stellar locus. Finally, (iv) the absolute colour calibration was obtained with
the white dwarf locus. We performed a joint Bayesian modelling of eleven J-PLUS
colour-colour diagrams using the theoretical white dwarf locus as reference.
This provides the needed offsets to transform instrumental magnitudes to
calibrated magnitudes outside the atmosphere. The uncertainty of the J-PLUS
photometric calibration, estimated from duplicated objects observed in adjacent
pointings and accounting for the absolute colour and flux calibration errors,
are ~19 mmag in u, J0378 and J0395, ~11 mmag in J0410 and J0430, and ~8 mmag in
g, J0515, r, J0660, i, J0861, and z. We present an optimized calibration method
for the large area multi-filter J-PLUS project, reaching 1-2% accuracy within
an area of 1 022 square degrees without the need for long observing calibration
campaigns or constant atmospheric monitoring. The proposed method will be
adapted for the photometric calibration of J-PAS, that will observe several
thousand square degrees with 56 narrow optical filters.

magnetic recording (HAMR) is expected to play an important role for the future
areal density increase of hard disk drives. Recently a write head design with
flipped write and return poles was proposed. In this design a large spatial
field gradient of the write head was the key to significantly reduce the
transition curvature. In this work we optimized the write pole of a
heat-assisted magnetic recording head in order to produce large field gradients
as well as large fields in the region of the heat pulse. This is done by
topology optimization. The simulations are performed with dolfin-adjoint. For
the maximum field gradients of $8.1\,$mT/nm, $8.6\,$mT/nm and $11.8\,$mT/nm,
locally resolved footprints of an FePt like hard magnetic recording medium are
computed with a coarse-grained Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) model and the
resulting transition curvature is analysed. Additional simulations with a
bilayer structure with $50\%$ hard and $50\%$ soft magnetic material are
computed. The results show that for both recording media, the optimized head
design does not lead to any significant improvement of the written track. Thus,
we analyse the transition curvature for the optimized write heads theoretically
with an effective recording time window (ERTW) model. Moreover, we check how
higher field gradients influence the curvature reduction. The results show that
a simple optimization of the conventional head design design is not sufficient
for effective curvature reduction. Instead, new head concepts will be needed to
reduce transition curvature.

involving the random branching degrees $\vec{d}$ and the random branch lengths
$\vec{\ell}$ of the tree. This speed is slower than that of the same equation
on the real line $\mathbb{R}$, and we estimate this slow down in terms of
$\vec{d}$ and $\vec{\ell}$. Our key idea is to project the Brownian motion on
the tree onto a one-dimensional axis along the direction of the wave
propagation. The projected process is a multi-skewed Brownian motion,
introduced by Ramirez [Multi-skewed Brownian motion and diffusion in layered
media, Proc. Am. Math. Soc., Vol. 139, No. 10, pp.3739-3752, 2011], with
skewness and interface sets that encode the metric structure $(\vec{d},

Feynman-Kac formula, this idea connects our analysis of the wavefront
propagation to the large deviations principle (LDP) of the multi-skewed
Brownian motion with random skewness and random interface set. Our LDP analysis
involves delicate estimates for an infinite product of $2\times 2$ random
matrices parametrized by $\vec{d}$ and $\vec{\ell}$ and for hitting times of a
random walk in random environment. By exhausting all possible shapes of the LDP
rate function (action functional), the analytic arguments that bridge the LDP

further ensure a stable supply of power to users. Motivated by the recent
advances of network dynamics, we proposed a framework based Lyapunov stability
to analyze the dynamically induced cascading failures in complex networks. We
abandoned the assumption that the network is stable in traditional static
failure models and then detected that small disturbances actually can trigger
cascading failures in unstable networks. What's worse, such failure usually
accompanied the overload failure of lines during the equilibriums conversion
process. Through the simulation analysis of the Spanish grid, we summarized
that the features of this new failure mode include low incidence, large
destructiveness, and fast propagation speed. And it usually tends to occur
first in edge nodes and subsequently propagate to the central nodes. These
features are consistent with the empirical observation of outages in practice.

important to transfer ConvNets between graphs. Transferability, which is a
certain type of generalization capability, can be loosely defined as follows:
if two graphs describe the same phenomenon, then a single filter or ConvNet
should have similar repercussions on both graphs. This paper aims at debunking
the common misconception that spectral filters are not transferable. We show
that if two graphs discretize the same ""continuous"" space, then a spectral
filter or ConvNet has approximately the same repercussion on both graphs. Our
analysis is more permissive than the standard analysis. Transferability is
typically described as the robustness of the filter to small graph

large graph perturbations. We prove transferability between graphs that can

fluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit
transformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class
membership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of
post-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is
error-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and
nuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to
segment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample
preparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that
operate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on
object detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we
propose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training
set. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale
and segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that
three out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34
backbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the
sample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation
performance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware
segmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,
consistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images
result in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and

noise source in many computing architectures and as a practical model for
analyzing error correction and fault tolerance. Here we prove several results
on efficiently learning Pauli channels, and more generally the Pauli projection
of a quantum channel. We first derive a procedure for learning a Pauli channel
on $n$ qubits with high probability to a relative precision $\epsilon$ using
$O\bigl(\epsilon^{-2} n 2^n\bigr)$ measurements, which is efficient in the
Hilbert space dimension. The estimate is robust to state preparation and
measurement errors which, together with the relative precision, makes it
especially appropriate for applications involving characterization of
high-accuracy quantum gates. Next we show that the error rates for an arbitrary
set of $s$ Pauli errors can be estimated to a relative precision $\epsilon$
using $O\bigl(\epsilon^{-4} \log s\log s/\epsilon\bigr)$ measurements. Finally,
we show that when the Pauli channel is given by a Markov field with at most
$k$-local correlations, we can learn an entire $n$-qubit Pauli channel to
relative precision $\epsilon$ with only $O_k\bigl(\epsilon^{-2} n^2 \log n
\bigr)$ measurements, which is efficient in the number of qubits. These results
enable a host of applications beyond just characterizing noise in a large-scale
quantum system: they pave the way to tailoring quantum codes, optimizing
decoders, and customizing fault tolerance procedures to suit a particular
device.

Here, the initial amounts of pure light and pure heavy flows are altered

the amounts of the mixing fluids are not equal. It is found that for the low
Atwood number cases, the asymmetric initial density distribution has limited
effects on both global and local flow evolution for HVDT. However, at high
Atwood number, both global flow evolution and the local flow structures are
strongly affected by the initial composition ratio. The flow composed of more
light fluid reaches higher turbulent levels and the local statistics reach
their fully-developed behavior earlier in the time evolution. During the late

to determine the stationary frequencies of liars and believers for four
different lie types. We consider altruistic white lies that favor the receiver
at a cost to the sender, black lies that favor the sender at a cost to the
receiver, spiteful lies that harm both the sender and the receiver, and Pareto
white lies that favor both the sender and the receiver. We find that spiteful
lies give rise to trivial behavior, where senders quickly learn that their best
strategy is to send a truthful message, whilst receivers likewise quickly learn
that their best strategy is to believe the sender's message. For altruistic
white lies and black lies, we find that most senders lie while most receivers
do not believe the sender's message, but the exact frequencies of liars and
non-believers depend significantly on the payoffs, and they also evolve
non-monotonically before reaching the stationary state. Lastly, for Pareto
white lies we observe the most complex dynamics, with the possibility of both
lying and believing evolving with all frequencies between 0 and 1 in dependence

the most massive clumps in W43-Main. The clumps MM2, MM3, MM4, MM6, MM7, and
MM8, have been resolved into two populations of fragmented filaments. From
these two populations we extracted 81 cores (96 with the MM1 cores) with masses
between 0.9 \Msun\ to 425 \Msun\ and a mass sensitivity of 0.08 M$_{\odot}$.
The MM6, MM7, and MM8 clumps show significant fragmentation, but the polarized
intensity appears to be sparse and compact. The MM2, MM3, and MM4 population
shows less fragmentation, but with a single proto-stellar core dominating the
emission at each clump. Also, the polarized intensity is more extended and
significantly stronger in this population. From the polarized emission, we
derived detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the filaments which we used
to estimate field strengths for 4 out of the 6 clumps. The average field
strengths estimations were found between 500 $\mu$G to 1.8 mG. Additionally, we
detected and modeled infalling motions towards MM2 and MM3 from single dish
HCO$^{+}(J=4 \rightarrow 3)$ and HCN$(J=4 \rightarrow 3)$ data resulting in
mass infall rates of $\dot{\mathrm{M}}_{\mathrm{MM2}} = 1.2 \times 10^{-2}$
\Msun\ yr$^{-1}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{M}}_{\mathrm{MM3}} = 6.3 \times 10^{-3}$
\Msun\ yr$^{-1}$. By using our estimations, we evaluated the dynamical
equilibrium of our cores by computing the total virial parameter
$\alpha_{\mathrm{total}}$. For the cores with reliable field estimations, we
found that 71\% of them appear to be gravitationally bound while the remaining
29\% are not. We concluded that these unbound cores, also less massive, are
still accreting and have not yet reached a critical mass. This also implies
different evolutionary time-scales, which essentially suggests that
star-formation in high mass filaments is not uniform.

altered the activity level of the biosphere, radically reshaping the
composition of Earth's oceans and atmosphere over time. However, the
mechanistic impacts of a primitive photosynthetic biosphere on Earth's early
atmospheric chemistry and climate are poorly understood. Here, we use a global
redox balance model to explore the biogeochemical and climatological effects of
different forms of primitive photosynthesis. We find that a hybrid ecosystem of
H2-based and Fe-based anoxygenic photoautotrophs - organisms that perform
photosynthesis without producing oxygen - gives rise to a strong nonlinear
amplification of Earth's methane (CH4) cycle, and would thus have represented a
critical component of Earth's early climate system before the advent of
oxygenic photosynthesis. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we find that a hybrid
photosynthetic biosphere widens the range of geochemical conditions that allow
for warm climate states well beyond either of these metabolic processes acting
in isolation. Our results imply that Earth's early climate was governed by a
novel and poorly explored set of regulatory feedbacks linking the anoxic
biosphere and the coupled H, C and Fe cycles. We suggest that similar processes
should be considered when assessing the potential for sustained habitability on
Earth-like planets with reducing atmospheres.

molecular interactions between curved slender fibers undergoing large

formulation, in the present work it is combined with the geometrically exact
beam theory and discretized via the finite element method. A direct evaluation
of the total interaction potential for general 3D bodies requires the
integration of contributions from molecule or charge distributions over the
volumes of the interaction partners, leading to a 6D integral (two nested 3D
integrals) that has to be solved numerically. Here, we propose a novel strategy
to formulate reduced section-to-section interaction laws for the resultant
interaction potential between a pair of cross-sections of two slender fibers
such that only two 1D integrals along the fibers' length directions have to be
solved numerically. This section-to-section interaction potential (SSIP)
approach yields a significant gain in efficiency, which is essential to enable
the simulation of relevant time and length scales for many practical
applications. In a first step, the generic structure of SSIP laws, which is
suitable for the most general interaction scenario (e.g. fibers with arbitrary
cross-section shape and inhomogeneous atomic/charge density within the
cross-section) is presented. Assuming circular, homogeneous cross-sections, in
a next step, specific analytical expressions for SSIP laws describing
short-range volume interactions (e.g. van der Waals or steric interactions) and
long-range surface interactions (e.g. Coulomb interactions) are proposed. The
validity of the SSIP laws as well as the accuracy and robustness of the general
SSIP approach to beam-to-beam interactions is thoroughly verified by means of a
set of numerical examples considering steric repulsion, electrostatic or van

procedures, the contrast of tumors against surrounding normal tissues in CT
images is often poor, aggravating the difficulty in accurate thermal ablation.
In this paper, we propose a fast MR-CT image registration method to overlay a
pre-procedural MR (pMR) image onto an intra-procedural CT (iCT) image for
guiding the thermal ablation of liver tumors. By first using a Cycle-GAN model
with mutual information constraint to generate synthesized CT (sCT) image from
the cor-responding pMR, pre-procedural MR-CT image registration is carried out
through traditional mono-modality CT-CT image registration. At the
intra-procedural stage, a partial-convolution-based network is first used to
inpaint the probe and its artifacts in the iCT image. Then, an unsupervised
registration network is used to efficiently align the pre-procedural CT (pCT)
with the inpainted iCT (inpCT) image. The final transformation from pMR to iCT
is obtained by combining the two estimated transformations,i.e., (1) from the
pMR image space to the pCT image space (through sCT) and (2) from the pCT image
space to the iCT image space (through inpCT). Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method achieves high registration accuracy with a very fast
computational speed.

Specifically, it covers the two-sided peeling and pull-off process starting
from fibers contacting along its entire length to fully separated fibers
including all intermediate configurations and the well-known physical
instability of snapping into contact and snapping free. We analyze the
resulting force-displacement curve showing a rich and highly nonlinear system
behavior arising from the interplay of adhesion, mechanical contact interaction
and structural resistance against (axial, shear and bending) deformation. While
similar to one-sided peeling studies from the literature, a distinct initiation
and peeling phase can be observed, the two-sided peeling setup considered in
the present work reveals the extended final pull-off stage as third
characteristic phase. Moreover, the influence of different material and
interaction parameters such as Young's modulus as well as type (electrostatic
or van der Waals) and strength of adhesion is critically studied. Most
importantly, it is found that the maximum force occurs in the pull-off phase
for electrostatic attraction, but in the initiation phase for van der Waals
adhesion. In addition to the physical system behavior, the most important
numerical aspects required to simulate this challenging computational problem
in a robust and accurate manner are discussed. Thus, besides the insights
gained into the considered two-fiber system, this study provides a proof of

Quantum systems with sufficiently uncorrelated and weak noise could be used to

quantum noise reliably and efficiently with high precision. Here we describe
such a protocol and report its experimental implementation on a 14-qubit

discovery of long-range two-qubit correlations in the 14 qubit device that had
not previously been detected. Our results are the first implementation of a

spatial structure of each frame is represented as rows of a matrix. To further
improve such representations, we introduce a novel skeleton image
representation to be used as input of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),

explicitly computing the magnitude and orientation values of the skeleton
joints. Different temporal scales are employed to compute motion values to
aggregate more temporal dynamics to the representation making it able to
capture longrange joint interactions involved in actions as well as filtering
noisy motion values. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the

by almost inextensible springs. In terms of behaviour, these springs closely
mimic rods that serve as representations of Kuhn steps. We find that the
predictions depend on the value of the repulsive parameter for bead-bead
pairwise interactions used in the DPD simulations ($a_{ij}$). For all systems,
the chain sizes and the relaxation time spectrum are analyzed. For $a_{ij} =
0$, theta solvent behaviour is obtained for the chain size, whereas the
dynamics at equilibrium agrees well with the predictions of the Zimm model. For
higher values of $a_{ij}$, the static properties of the chain show good solvent
behaviour. However, the scaling laws for the chain dynamics at equilibrium show
wide variations, with consistent results obtained only at an intermediate value
of $a_{ij} = 25$. At higher values of the repulsive parameter ($a_{ij} \geq
25$), our simulations are also able to predict the abrupt cut-off in the
relaxation spectrum, which has been observed earlier in experiments of dilute
solutions. The cut-off reached an extent that, for chain lengths of 10 Kuhn
steps, the spectrum consists of a single time scale. This agrees remarkably
well with earlier experiments and MD simulations. To verify further, we also
studied the chain dynamics in shear flow using DPD simulations. Specifically,
we analysed the variation of the chain stretch and end-over-end tumbling with
shear rates. Overall, the trends obtained from DPD simulations agree well with
those observed in earlier BD simulations.

heavy Majorana neutrino decays at colliders in view of the requirement to
explain the light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. In the minimal
model with only two heavy neutrinos and in the $\nu$MSM one can identify three
distinct regions in the mass-mixing plane. For Majorana masses above the
electroweak scale the branching ratio for lepton number violating processes at
the LHC is generically suppressed. For masses well below the electroweak scale
that are probed in displaced vertex searches or at fixed target experiments
lepton number violation is the rule and can only be avoided at the cost of fine
tuning. In between there is a mass regime where both possibilities coexist. In
models with more than two heavy neutrinos the larger parameter space allows for
more freedom, but our results remain qualitatively correct unless there is a
mass degeneracy amongst more than two of the heavy neutrinos.

systems for continuous control tasks in robotics. The key contribution is a
control-theoretic regularizer for dynamics fitting rooted in the notion of
stabilizability, a constraint which guarantees the existence of robust tracking
controllers for arbitrary open-loop trajectories generated with the learned
system. Leveraging tools from contraction theory and statistical learning in
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, we formulate stabilizable dynamics learning
as a functional optimization with convex objective and bi-convex functional
constraints. Under a mild structural assumption and relaxation of the
functional constraints to sampling-based constraints, we derive the optimal
solution with a modified Representer theorem. Finally, we utilize random matrix
feature approximations to reduce the dimensionality of the search parameters
and formulate an iterative convex optimization algorithm that jointly fits the
dynamics functions and searches for a certificate of stabilizability. We
validate the proposed algorithm in simulation for a planar quadrotor, and on a
quadrotor hardware testbed emulating planar dynamics. We verify, both in
simulation and on hardware, significantly improved trajectory generation and
tracking performance with the control-theoretic regularized model over models
learned using traditional regression techniques, especially when learning from
small supervised datasets. The results support the conjecture that the use of
stabilizability constraints as a form of regularization can help prune the
hypothesis space in a manner that is tailored to the downstream task of
trajectory generation and feedback control, resulting in models that are not
only dramatically better conditioned, but also data efficient.

reconstructing cameras and the 3D point cloud of a non-rigid object from an
ensemble of images with 2D correspondences. Current NRSfM algorithms are
limited from two perspectives: (i) the number of images, and (ii) the type of
shape variability they can handle. These difficulties stem from the inherent
conflict between the condition of the system and the degrees of freedom needing
to be modeled -- which has hampered its practical utility for many applications
within vision. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical sparse coding
model for NRSFM which can overcome (i) and (ii) to such an extent, that NRSFM
can be applied to problems in vision previously thought too ill posed. Our
approach is realized in practice as the training of an unsupervised deep neural
network (DNN) auto-encoder with a unique architecture that is able to
disentangle pose from 3D structure. Using modern deep learning computational
platforms allows us to solve NRSfM problems at an unprecedented scale and shape
complexity. Our approach has no 3D supervision, relying solely on 2D point
correspondences. Further, our approach is also able to handle missing/occluded
2D points without the need for matrix completion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the impressive performance of our approach where we exhibit
superior precision and robustness against all available state-of-the-art works
in some instances by an order of magnitude. We further propose a new quality
measure (based on the network weights) which circumvents the need for 3D
ground-truth to ascertain the confidence we have in the reconstructability. We
believe our work to be a significant advance over state-of-the-art in NRSFM.

multidrug resistance that they display, partly due to the presence of a
permeability barrier comprising two membranes with active efflux. New
approaches are urgently needed to design antibiotics effective against these
pathogens. In this work, we present a novel topological fragment-based approach
(""Hunting Fragments Of X"" or ""Hunting FOX"") to rationally ""hunt for"" chemical
fragments that promote compound ability to permeate the outer membrane. Our
approach generalizes to other drug design applications. We measure minimum
inhibitory concentrations of compounds in two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
with variable permeability barriers and use them as an input to the Hunting FOX
algorithm to identify molecular fragments responsible for enhanced outer
membrane permeation properties and candidate molecules from an external library
that demonstrate good permeation ability. Overall, we present proof of concept
for a novel method that is expected to be valuable for rational design of
hybrid drugs.

learning problems because it only need function values (not gradient) in the
optimization. Recently, although many zeroth-order methods have been developed,
these approaches still have two main drawbacks: 1) high function query
complexity; 2) not being well suitable for solving the problems with complex
penalties and constraints. To address these challenging drawbacks, in this
paper, we propose a class of faster zeroth-order stochastic alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) methods (ZO-SPIDER-ADMM) to solve the
nonconvex finite-sum problems with multiple nonsmooth penalties. Moreover, we
prove that the ZO-SPIDER-ADMM methods can achieve a lower function query
complexity of $O(nd+dn^{\frac{1}{2}}\epsilon^{-1})$ for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary point, which improves the existing best nonconvex
zeroth-order ADMM methods by a factor of $O(d^{\frac{1}{3}}n^{\frac{1}{6}})$,
where $n$ and $d$ denote the sample size and dimension of data, respectively.
At the same time, we propose a class of faster zeroth-order online ADMM methods
(ZOO-ADMM+) to solve the nonconvex online problems with multiple nonsmooth
penalties. We also prove that the proposed ZOO-ADMM+ methods can achieve a
lower function query complexity of $O(d\epsilon^{-\frac{3}{2}})$, which
improves the existing best result by a factor of $O(\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}})$.
Extensive experimental results on the structure adversarial attack on black-box
deep neural networks demonstrate the efficiency of our new algorithms.

boundary channel is direct and instantaneous, while the bulk channel respects
the bulk causality and takes a certain amount of time to complete signaling. In
the latter case, we show that the signal frequency detected on the other side

Here we deterministically generate up to 10-qubit superradiant and 8-qubit

quantum circuit with multiple qubits interconnected by a cavity resonator. The
$\sqrt{N}$-scaling enhancement of the coupling strength between the

traffic data. We propose an extended non-negative Matrix Factorization based
algorithm smoothed over both spatial and temporal dimensions to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the city. The algorithm also ensures the
orthogonality of its result to facilitate the interpretation of different
patterns. A suite of visualizations is designed to illustrate the dynamics of
city segmentation and the corresponding interactions are added to support the

systems, the oscillator's phase has been widely used as an effective
one-dimensional description of a higher dimensional dynamics, particularly for
driven or coupled systems. Hence, efforts have been made to generalize the
phase concept to the stochastic framework. One notion of phase due to
Schwabedal and Pikovsky is based on the mean-return time (MRT) of the
oscillator but has so far been described only in terms of a numerical
algorithm. Here we develop the boundary condition by which the partial
differential equation for the MRT has to be complemented in order to obtain the
isochrons (lines of equal phase) of a two-dimensional stochastic oscillator,
and rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of the MRT isochron
function (up to an additive constant). We illustrate the method with a number
of examples: the stochastic heteroclinic oscillator (which would not oscillate
in the absence of noise); the isotropic Stuart-Landau oscillator, the
Newby-Schwemmer oscillator, and the Stuart-Landau oscillator with polarized
noise. For selected isochrons we confirm by extensive stochastic simulations
that the return time from an isochron to the same isochron (after one complete
rotation) is always the mean first-passage time (irrespective of the initial
position on the isochron). Put differently, we verify that Schwabedal and
Pikovsky's criterion for an isochron is satisfied. In addition, we discuss how
to extend the construction to arbitrary finite dimensions. Our results will
enable development of analytical tools to study and compare different notions
of phase for stochastic oscillators.

ADMM-based DML framework with two novel features: First, we remove the
assumption commonly made in the literature that the users trust the server
collecting their data. Second, the framework provides heterogeneous privacy for
users depending on data's sensitive levels and servers' trust degrees. The
challenging issue is to keep the accumulation of privacy losses over ADMM
iterations minimal. In the proposed framework, a local randomization approach,
which is differentially private, is adopted to provide users with
self-controlled privacy guarantee for the most sensitive information. Further,
the ADMM algorithm is perturbed through a combined noise-adding method, which
simultaneously preserves privacy for users' less sensitive information and
strengthens the privacy protection of the most sensitive information. We
provide detailed analyses on the performance of the trained model according to
its generalization error. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using
real-world datasets to validate the theoretical results and evaluate the

and Geometry: How many points can you find on the (half) parabola $y=x^2$,
$x>0$, so that the distance between any pair of them is rational? This problem
sounds like a geometry problem, but it is likely to require techniques in
number theory. That's because, to determine if the distance between (a,b) and
(s,t) is rational, you need to test whether $(a-s)^2$ + $(b-t)^2$ is the square
of a rational number...and such questions typically fall into the realm of
number theory. Of course, since this is an open problem, no-one can claim to
know just what field the problem lies in, since no-one knows the solution. I
believe it is not even known if there are more than 5 points on the parabola
which satisfy the condition. It is certainly not known if there is an infinite
family with pairwise rational distances. We can quickly see that there are
three such points in the following way: Pick two rational numbers, say 1/5 and
3/5, and let those be the distances between the pairs of points AB and BC. If
you fix those distances and slide the points up the parabola, the distance AC
will gradually increase, bounded above by 4/5. Since the rational numbers are
dense in the reals, there will be many placements of the points so that AC is a
rational distance. It is not too hard to show that if you have N points on the
parabola with rational distances between them, then you can find N points on
the parabola with integer distances between them.
  This problem is publicly posted on the DIMACS mathematical research website
in order to search for solutions. This paper demonstrates that an infinite
number of families each containing an arbitrarily large number of such pairwise
rational points on the parabola can be found. A constructive algorithm for
doing so is outlined in the paper.
