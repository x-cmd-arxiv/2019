in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy imaging to provide local strain
measurement in crystals by comparing the crystal lattice with the scanning
raster that then serves as the reference. The images obtained in this way
contain a beating fringe pattern with a local period that represents the
deviation of the lattice from the reference. In order to obtain the actual
strain value, a region containing a full period of the fringe is required,

  Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 2020)",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the tradeoffs between fairness and efficiency when allocating
indivisible items over time. Suppose T items arrive over time and must be
allocated upon arrival, immediately and irrevocably, to one of n agents. Agent
i assigns a value v_{it} in [0,1] to the t-th item to arrive and has an
additive valuation function. If the values are chosen by an adaptive adversary
it is known that the algorithm that minimizes maximum pairwise envy simply
allocates each item uniformly at random; the maximum pairwise envy is then
sublinear in T. If the values are independently and identically drawn from an
adversarially chosen distribution D, it is also known that, under some mild
conditions on D, allocating to the agent with the highest value -- a Pareto
efficient allocation -- is envy-free with high probability.
  In this paper we study fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in this setting and
provide matching upper and lower bounds under a spectrum of progressively
stronger adversaries. On one hand we show that, even against a non-adaptive
adversary, there is no algorithm with sublinear maximum pairwise envy that
Pareto dominates the simple algorithm that allocates each item uniformly at
random. On the other hand, under a slightly weaker adversary regime where item
values are drawn from a known distribution and are independent with respect to
time, i.e. v_{it} is independent of v_{it'} but possibly correlated with
v_{i't}, optimal (in isolation) efficiency is compatible with optimal (in
isolation) fairness. That is, we give an algorithm that is Pareto efficient
ex-post and is simultaneously optimal with respect to fairness: for each pair
of agents i and j, either i envies j by at most one item (a prominent fairness
notion), or $i$ does not envy j with high probability. En route, we prove a
structural result about allocations of divisible items that might be of
independent interest.

global uniform asymptotic stability under zero input (0-GUAS) and uniformly
bounded energy input-bounded state (UBEBS). For impulsive systems, asymptotic
stability can be weak (when the asymptotic decay depends only on elapsed time)

valid for time-varying impulsive systems, provided that stability is understood

connecting a small antenna to an amplifier with a real input impedance several

low noise characteristics. The gain of the low noise parametric amplifier

Despite the long-term vision, however, existing studies on black-box
adversarial attacks are still restricted to very specific settings of threat
models (e.g., single distortion metric and restrictive assumption on target
model's feedback to queries) and/or suffer from prohibitively high query

framework based on an operator splitting method, the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) to devise efficient, robust black-box attacks that
work with various distortion metrics and feedback settings without incurring
high query complexity. Due to the black-box nature of the threat model, the
proposed ADMM solution framework is integrated with zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization and Bayesian optimization (BO), and thus is applicable to the
gradient-free regime. This results in two new black-box adversarial attack
generation methods, ZO-ADMM and BO-ADMM. Our empirical evaluations on image

based on the SU(2)-covariant drift-diffusion equations from which we derive the
BC at hybrid interfaces. Within this formulation, the spin current is
covariantly conserved when the spin relaxation is only due to the intrinsic
SOC. This conservation leads to the absence of spin Hall (SH) currents in
homogeneous systems. We also consider extrinsic sources of relaxation (ESR), as
magnetic impurities, which break the covariant spin conservation, and may lead
to SH currents. We apply our model to describe nonlocal transport in a system
with an interface separating two regions: one normal region without intrinsic
SOC and one with a Rashba SOC. We first explore the inverse spin-galvanic
effect, i.e., a spin polarization induced by an electric field. We demonstrate
how the spatial behavior of such spin density depends on both, the direction of
the electric field and the strength of the ESR rate. We also study the
spin-to-charge conversion, and compute the charge current and the distribution
of electrochemical potential in the Rashba region induced by a spin current
injected into the normal region. In systems with an inhomogeneous SOC varying

divided into an instantaneous change of potential at constant velocities due to
a given mass loss or gain, followed by energy-conserving relaxation to a new
Jeans equilibrium. The halo profile is modeled by a two-parameter function with
a variable inner slope and an analytic potential profile (Dekel et al. 2017),
which enables determining the associated kinetic energy at equilibrium. The
model is tested against NIHAO cosmological zoom-in simulations, where it
successfully predicts the evolution of the inner dark-matter profile between
successive snapshots in about 75% of the cases, failing mainly in merger

origin of a magnetic driven outflow. We use a setup of an isolated disc galaxy
with a realistic circum-galactic medium (CGM). We find good agreement of the
galactic dynamo with theoretical and observational predictions from the radial
and toroidal components of the magnetic field as function of radius and disc
scale height. We find several field reversals indicating dipole structure at
early times and quadrupole structure at late times. Together with the magnetic
pitch angle and the dynamo control parameters $R_{\alpha}$, $R_{\omega}$ and
$D$ we present strong evidence for an $\alpha^2$-$\Omega$ dynamo. The formation
of a bar in the centre leads to further amplification of the magnetic field via
adiabatic compression which subsequently drives an outflow. Due to the
Parker-Instability the magnetic field lines rise to the edge of the disc, break
out and expand freely in the CGM driven by the magnetic pressure. Finally, we
investigate the correlation between magnetic field and star formation rate.
Globally, we find that the magnetic field is increasing as function of the star
formation rate surface density with a slope between $0.3$ and $0.45$ in good
agreement with predictions from theory and observations. Locally, we find that
the magnetic field can decrease while star formation increases. We find that
this effect is correlated with the diffusion of magnetic field from the spiral

sizes, we find that the nature of the ground state is remarkably sensitive to
the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$. Without $t'$ the ground
state of the system corresponds with the insulating filled stripe phase with
long-range charge-density-wave (CDW) order and short-range incommensurate spin
correlations appears. However, for a small negative $t'$ a phase characterized
by coexisting algebraic d-wave superconducting (SC)- and algebraic CDW
correlations. In addition, it shows short range spin- and fermion correlations
consistent with a canonical Luther-Emery (LE) liquid, except that the charge-
and spin periodicities are consistent with half-filled stripes instead of the
$4 k_F$ and $2 k_F$ wavevectors generic for one dimensional chains. For a small
positive $t'$ yet another phase takes over showing similar SC and CDW
correlations. However, the fermions are now characterized by a (near) infinite
correlation length while the gapped spin system is characterized by simple
staggered antiferromagnetic correlations. We will show that this is consistent
with a LE formed from a weakly coupled (BCS like) d-wave superconductor on the

magnetic resonance.

matter how much care is put into isolating it. As a consequence, quantum bits
(qubits) undergo errors, putting dauntingly difficult constraints on the
hardware suitable for quantum computation. New strategies are emerging to
circumvent this problem by encoding a qubit non-locally across the phase space
of a physical system. Since most sources of decoherence are due to local
fluctuations, the foundational promise is to exponentially suppress errors by
increasing a measure of this non-locality. Prominent examples are topological
qubits which delocalize quantum information over real space and where spatial
extent measures non-locality. In this work, we encode a qubit in the field
quadrature space of a superconducting resonator endowed with a special
mechanism that dissipates photons in pairs. This process pins down two
computational states to separate locations in phase space. As we increase this
separation, we measure an exponential decrease of the bit-flip rate while only
linearly increasing the phase-flip rate. Since bit-flips are continuously and
autonomously corrected at the single qubit level, only phase-flips are left to
be corrected via a one-dimensional quantum error correction code. This
exponential scaling demonstrates that resonators with non-linear dissipation
are promising building blocks for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation
with drastically reduced hardware overhead.

variability of the dark-energy, a new, standardisable candle that can reach
more distant Universe has been awaited. Here we propose a new distance measure
using fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are a new emerging population of $\sim$
ms time scale radio bursts that can reach high-$z$ in quantity. We show an
empirical positive correlation between the time-integrated luminosity
(L$_{\nu}$) and rest-frame intrinsic duration ($w_{\rm int,rest}$) of FRBs. The
L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ correlation is with a weak strength but
statistically very significant, i.e., Pearson coefficient is $\sim$ 0.5 with
p-value of $\sim$0.038, despite the smallness of the current sample. This
correlation can be used to measure intrinsic luminosity of FRBs from the
observed $w_{\rm int,rest}$. By comparing the luminosity with observed flux, we
measure luminosity distances to FRBs, and thereby construct the Hubble diagram.
This FRB cosmology with the L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ relation has several
advantages over SNe Ia, Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and well-known FRB dispersion
measure (DM)-$z$ cosmology; (i) access to higher redshift Universe beyond the
SNe Ia, (ii) high event rate that is $\sim$ 3 order of magnitude more frequent
than GRBs, and (iii) it is free from the uncertainty from intergalactic
electron density models, i.e., we can remove the largest uncertainty in the
well-debated DM-$z$ cosmology of FRB. Our simulation suggests that the
L$_{\nu}-w_{\rm int,rest}$ relation provides us with useful constraints on the
time variability of the dark energy when the next generation radio telescopes
start to find FRBs in quantity.

1.4~GHz to 3000~GHz in six redshift bins between $0.3<z<3.5$. We model the
emission components in the radio and far-infrared, plus a spectral distortion
from the tSZ effect. At $z>1.91$, we measure the tSZ effect at $3.8\sigma$
significance with an amplitude corresponding to a total thermal energy of
$3.1\times10^{60}$ ergs. If this energy is due to virialized gas, then our
measurement implies quasar host halo masses are
$\sim6\times10^{12}~h^{-1}$M$_\odot$. Alternatively, if the host dark matter
halo masses are $\sim2\times10^{12}~h^{-1}$M$_\odot$ as some measurements
suggest, then we measure a $>$90 per cent excess in the thermal energy over
that expected due to virialization. If the measured SZ effect is primarily due
to hot bubbles from quasar-driven winds, we find that $(5^{+1.2}_{-1.3}$) per
cent of the quasar bolometric luminosity couples to the intergalactic medium
over a fiducial quasar lifetime of 100 Myr. An additional source of tSZ may be
correlated structure, and further work is required to separate the

analytical results are obtained from a perturbative expansion of the twist
field one-point function in the post-quench quasi-particle basis. The expected
linear growth of the R\'enyi entropies at large times $mt\gg 1$ emerges from a
perturbative calculation at second order. We also show that the R\'enyi and von

contributions of frequency $2m$ and amplitude proportional to $(mt)^{-3/2}$.
The oscillatory terms are correctly predicted by an alternative perturbation
series, in the pre-quench quasi-particle basis, which we also discuss. A
comparison to lattice numerical calculations carried out on an Ising chain in
the scaling limit shows very good agreement with the quantum field theory
predictions. We also find evidence of clustering of twist field correlators

subsystem boundary points.

a policy trained to solve a task in one environment often fails to solve the

being invariant, the policy should identify the specific nuances of an

propose the 'Environment-Probing' Interaction (EPI) policy, a policy that
probes a new environment to extract an implicit understanding of that

it is used as an additional input to a task-specific policy that can now
perform environment-conditioned actions to solve a task. To learn these

Specifically, a higher reward is given if the trajectory generated by the

popular in practice, local convergence is still sluggish. Faster variants
depend either on problem structure or on analyses that elide sequences of
""null"" steps. Motivated by a semi-structured approach to optimization and the
sequential quadratic programming philosophy, we describe a new bundle Newton
method that incorporates second-order objective information with the usual
linear approximation oracle. One representative problem class consists of
maxima of several smooth functions, individually inaccessible to the oracle.
Given as additional input just the cardinality of the optimal active set, we
prove local quadratic convergence. A simple implementation shows promise on
more general functions, both convex and nonconvex, and suggests first-order
analogues.

of intelligent reasoning. Decision-making has been well studied when the
available information is considered at the associative (probabilistic) level.
The classical Theorems of von Neumann-Morgenstern and Savage provide a formal
criterion for rational choice using associative information: maximize expected
utility. There is an ongoing debate around the origin of probabilities involved
in such calculation. In this work, we will show how the probabilities for
decision-making can be grounded in causal models by considering decision
problems in which the available actions and consequences are causally
connected. In this setting, actions are regarded as an intervention over a
causal model. Then, we extend a previous causal decision-making result, which
relies on a known causal model, to the case in which the causal mechanism that
controls some environment is unknown to a rational decision-maker. In this way,
action-outcome probabilities can be grounded in causal models in known and
unknown cases. Finally, as an application, we extend the well-known concept of
Nash Equilibrium to the case in which the players of a strategic game consider
causal information.

it is involved in reactions of relevance for several nucleosynthesis scenarios.
The aim of this work is to analyze various reactions involving $^{15}$C, using
a single structure model based on Halo EFT. To develop a Halo-EFT model of
$^{15}$C at NLO, we first extract the ANC of its ground state by analyzing
$^{14}$C(d,p)$^{15}$C transfer data at low energy. Using this Halo-EFT
description, we study the $^{15}$C Coulomb breakup at high (605AMeV) and
intermediate (68AMeV) energies using eikonal models with a consistent treatment
of nuclear and Coulomb interactions at all orders, and proper relativistic
corrections. Finally, we study the $^{14}$C(n,$\gamma$)$^{15}$C radiative
capture. Our theoretical cross sections are in good agreement with experimental
data for all reactions, thereby assessing the robustness of the $^{15}$C
Halo-EFT model. Since a simple NLO description is enough to reproduce all data,
the only nuclear-structure observables that matter are the binding energy and
its ANC, showing that all the reactions considered are purely peripheral. In
particular, it confirms the ANC value obtained for the $^{15}$C ground state:
1.59$\pm$0.06fm$^{-1}$. Our model provides also a new estimate of the
radiative-capture cross section at astrophysical energy (23.3keV):
4.66$\pm$0.14$\mu$b. Including a Halo-EFT description of $^{15}$C within
precise models of reactions is confirmed to be an excellent way to relate the
nucleus reaction cross sections and structure. Its systematic expansion enables
us to deduce which nuclear-structure observables are actually probed in the
collision. From this, we can infer valuable information on both the structure
of $^{15}$C and its synthesis through the $^{14}$C(n,$\gamma$)$^{15}$C
radiative capture at astrophysical energies.

the data generated from the scientific simulations is growing rapidly. As a
result, application scientists need effective data summarization techniques
that can reduce large-scale multivariate spatiotemporal data sets while
preserving the important data properties so that the reduced data can answer
domain-specific queries involving multiple variables with sufficient accuracy.
While analyzing complex scientific events, domain experts often analyze and
visualize two or more variables together to obtain a better understanding of
the characteristics of the data features. Therefore, data summarization
techniques are required to analyze multi-variable relationships in detail and
then perform data reduction such that the important features involving multiple
variables are preserved in the reduced data. To achieve this, in this work, we
propose a data sub-sampling algorithm for performing statistical data
summarization that leverages pointwise information theoretic measures to
quantify the statistical association of data points considering multiple
variables and generates a sub-sampled data that preserves the statistical
association among multi-variables. Using such reduced sampled data, we show
that multivariate feature query and analysis can be done effectively. The
efficacy of the proposed multivariate association driven sampling algorithm is
presented by applying it on several scientific data sets.

coherent-nuclear photoproduction of pions, $({\g,\pi^0})$, combined with
elastic electron scattering, has been suggested to be a very accurate probe of
density differences. {\bf Purpose:} Study the ${(\g,\pi^0})$ reaction mechanism
so as to better access the uncertainties involved in extracting the neutron
density. {\bf Methods:} Include the effects of final-state pion-nucleus
charge-exchange reactions on the cross section and study the influence of the
non-zero spatial extent of the proton. {\bf Results:} The effects of
final-state charge-exchange increase the cross section between 6\% and 5\%,
generally decreasing as the momentum transfer increases. This leads to an
increase of the extracted neutron skin distance by about 50\%. The validity of
the previous treatments of the proton size is confirmed. {\bf Conclusion:} The
model dependence of the theoretically computed cross section increases the
total systematic uncertainty (experiment plus theory) in extracting the neutron

different wavelengths automatically self-adapts to slightly different effective

self-adaptive variation on the confinement, we open up the window of
low-anomalous dispersion in a large wavelength range, and theoretically
demonstrate frequency combs with improved bandwidths with respect to the
state-of-art in several different waveguide configurations considered, for a

that had negligible thermal velocities at early times. Progress over the past
three decades has led to a nearly complete description of the assembly,

analyze the mixed fluctuations of energy and baryon number, $\langle\Delta

uncertainties, into the optimization process... Methods: The 4D robust
optimizer used a 4DCT image set to obtain information regarding patient
breathing and included a beam-delivery simulation to incorporate the interplay
effect. The doses from potential spots were calculated on all breathing phases
using Monte Carlo simulation, deformed to a reference phase using deformable

different phases were based on the beam-delivery simulation. Robustness was
added to the optimization by considering range and setup uncertainties as
physical-uncertainty scenarios and uncertainties in the patient breathing and
treatment delivery as temporal uncertainty scenarios... Results: The 4D
robustly optimized plans exhibited improved target coverage with an average
increase in the dose to 98% of the target volume of 4.9%, improved homogeneity

robustness with decreased ranges in coverage and homogeneity amongst all

exact similarity search indexing techniques suffer from the well-known curse of
dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces, approximate search techniques are
often utilized instead. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) has been shown to be
an effective approximate search method for solving similarity search queries in
high-dimensional spaces. Often times, queries in real-world settings arrive as
part of a query workload. LSH and its variants are particularly designed to
solve single queries effectively. They suffer from one major drawback while
executing query workloads: they do not take into consideration important data

devices. This leads to a distributed inference paradigm in which memory and
communication costs represent a major bottleneck. Yet, existing model
compression techniques are not communication-aware. Therefore, we propose
Network of Neural Networks (NoNN), a new distributed IoT learning paradigm that
compresses a large pretrained 'teacher' deep network into several disjoint and
highly-compressed 'student' modules, without loss of accuracy. Moreover, we
propose a network science-based knowledge partitioning algorithm for the
teacher model, and then train individual students on the resulting disjoint
partitions. Extensive experimentation on five image classification datasets,
for user-defined memory/performance budgets, show that NoNN achieves higher
accuracy than several baselines and similar accuracy as the teacher model,
while using minimal communication among students. Finally, as a case study, we
deploy the proposed model for CIFAR-10 dataset on edge devices and demonstrate
significant improvements in memory footprint (up to 24x), performance (up to
12x), and energy per node (up to 14x) compared to the large teacher model. We
further show that for distributed inference on multiple edge devices, our

consideration is motivated by complementarity. We analyse the pair correlations
(photons or spin 1/2 particles) based on the limitations put on complementary
observables when they are modelled as classical, non-commuting operators. As
complementarity comes with both single particle properties and correlations
insufficiently captured by classical theory together with `non-commutativity',
we argue that a complete model should allow complementary observables to have
new local dependences. That is, the existing information should not be
restricted to be classical (simultaneously observable). Given this new
correlation model, the central question is if information theory ought to be
extended accordingly in quantum physics.

Unlike conventional image classification approaches that are designed to be
invariant to translations of objects in the scene, we focus on tasks where the
output classes vary with respect to where an object of interest is situated
within an image. To handle this variant of the image classification task, we
propose augmenting the standard cross-entropy (classification) loss with a
domain dependent Forced Spatial Attention (FSA) loss, which in essence compels
the network to attend to specific regions in the image associated with the
desired output class. To demonstrate the utility of this loss function, we
consider the task of driver foot activity classification - where each activity
is strongly correlated with where the driver's foot is in the scene. Training
with our proposed loss function results in significantly improved accuracies,
better generalization, and robustness against noise, while obviating the need

Theoretically, the iPCM structure it has been predicted to form a 3D

thicknesses. Here, we experimentally investigate the topological insulating
nature of chalcogenide SLs using a helicity dependent time-resolved Kerr

Dirac-like cone in some chalcogenide SLs. Furthermore, we found that increasing
the thickness of the GeTe layer dramatically changes the periodicity,
indicating a phase transition from a Dirac semimetal into a trivial insulator.
Our results demonstrate that thickness-tuned chalcogenide SLs can play an
important role in the manipulation of topological states, which may open up new
possibilities for spintronic devices based on chalcogenide SLs.

(ERP) or multiple perspective projections. Different from the flat 2D images,
the detection task is challenging for 360{\deg} images due to the distortion of
ERP and the inefficiency of perspective projections. However, existing methods
mostly focus on one of the above representations instead of both, leading to
limited detection performance. Moreover, the lack of appropriate bounding-box
annotations as well as the annotated datasets further increases the
difficulties of the detection task. In this paper, we present a standard object
detection framework for 360{\deg} images. Specifically, we adapt the
terminologies of the traditional object detection task to the omnidirectional
scenarios, and propose a novel two-stage object detector, i.e., Reprojection
R-CNN by combining both ERP and perspective projection. Owing to the
omnidirectional field-of-view of ERP, Reprojection R-CNN first generates coarse
region proposals efficiently by a distortion-aware spherical region proposal
network. Then, it leverages the distortion-free perspective projection and
refines the proposed regions by a novel reprojection network. We construct two
novel synthetic datasets for training and evaluation. Experiments reveal that
Reprojection R-CNN outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on the mAP
metric. In addition, the proposed detector could run at 178ms per image in the
panoramic datasets, which implies its practicability in real-world
applications.

$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological charges, and propose to probe it by
magnetotransport measurement. In analogy to the chiral anomaly in a Weyl
semimetal, the acceleration of electrons by a spin bias along the magnetic
field can create a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ charge imbalance between the Dirac points,
the relaxation of which contributes a measurable positive longitudinal spin
magnetoconductivity (LSMC) to the system. The $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ anomaly induced
LSMC is a spin version of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity (LMC) due to the
chiral anomaly, which possesses all characters of the chiral anomaly induced
LMC. While the chiral anomaly in the topological Dirac semimetal is very
sensitive to local magnetic impurities, the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ anomaly is found
to be immune to local magnetic disorder. It is further demonstrated that the
quadratic or linear field dependence of the positive LMC is not unique to the
chiral anomaly. Base on this, we argue that the periodic-in-$1/B$ quantum
oscillations superposed on the positive LSMC can serve as a fingerprint of the
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ anomaly in topological Dirac semimetals.

parties becomes increasingly common, so does the potential for data leakage. As
required by new data protection regulations and laws, when PII leakage occurs,
one must be able to reliably identify the leaking sources. Existing solutions
utilize watermark technologies or data object allocation strategies to
differentiate the data shared with different parties to identify potential
leakers. However, these solutions lose their effectiveness under several attack
scenarios, e.g., a data sender may leak the data and a receiver may deny the
reception of certain shared data. Worse yet, multiple receivers might collude
and apply a set of operations such as intersection, complement, and union to
their received datasets before leaking them, making the task of leaker
identification even more difficult.
  In this paper, we propose AuditShare, a PII dataset sharing system with
reliable leaking source identification. Firstly, taking advantage of the
intrinsic properties of PII data, AuditShare allocates data objects to
individual sharing parties by PII attributes. Secondly, AuditShare obliviously
transfers data between the sender and each receiver and uses a Merkle Tree as
an immutable record of the sharing. Thirdly, a knowledge-based identification
algorithm is proposed to identify a guilty sender or colluding/non-colluding
receivers. Through our evaluation, we show that: (i) With a modest amount of

identify all the guilty parties in different cases; (ii) It only takes 0.5

gaits in a few minutes. This allows us to use reinforcement learning with
Reference State Initialization (RSI) to find a neural network controller for
imitating the synthesized reference motion. We further accelerate the learning
using a novel curriculum learning approach called Termination Curriculum (TC),
that adapts the episode termination threshold over time. The combination of the
RSI and TC ensures that simulation budget is not wasted in regions of the state
space not visited by the final policy. As a result, our agents can learn
locomotion skills in just a few hours on a modest 4-core computer. We
demonstrate this by producing locomotion movements for a variety of characters.

dynamics simulations are conducted to investigate the transport of Na$^+$ and
Cl$^-$ ions through nanopores with the diameter below 6 nm. It is found that
the formation of the contact ion pair plays a critical role in reducing the ion
mobility inside a nanopore without surface charges. The mobility for both
cations and anions decreases with the reduced pore size because it is easier to
form the contact ion pairs inside the neutral nanopore with smaller diameter.
Inside a charged nanopores, besides the contact ion pair formation, the surface
charges also play a significant role in reducing the counterion mobility
through surface trapping. It is uncovered that the mobility of Na$^+$ ions
increases first and then decreases with the surface charge density, while
Cl$^-$ ions have the opposite trend. A modified first-passage time model is
proposed to take into account the ion pair formation and the trapped ions
inside a nanopore, which provides a clear picture in describing ion transport

utilizes a system transition and system observation function based on a

  - a region where solitons and breathers travel with positive velocities on a
constant background c_+;
  - an expanding oscillatory region that can contain generically breathers;
  - a region of breathers travelling with negative velocities on the constant
background c_-.
  When the oscillatory region does not contain breathers, it coincides up to a
phase shift with the dispersive shock wave solution obtained for the exact step
initial data. The phase shift depends on the solitons, breathers and the
radiation of the initial data. This shows that the dispersive shock wave is a
coherent structure that interacts in an elastic way with solitons, breathers

classification to be less prognostic of outcomes such as recurrence after
treatment. Alternative pretreatment strategies for prognosis of NPC after
treatment are needed to provide better risk stratification for NPC. In this
study we proposed a deep convolution neural network model based on
contrast-enhanced T1 (T1C) and T2 weighted (T2) MRI scan to predict 3-year
disease progression of NPC patient after primary treatment. We retrospective
obtained 596 non-metastatic NPC patients from four independent centres in Hong
Kong and China. Our model first performs a segmentation of the primary NPC
tumour to localise the tumour, and then uses the segmentation mask as prior
knowledge along with the T1C and T2 scan to classify 3-year disease
progression. For segmentation, we adapted and modified a VNet to encode both
T1C and T2 scan and also encoding to classify T and overall stage
classification. Our modified network performed better than baseline VNet with
T1C and network with no T and overall classification. The classification result
for 3-year disease progression achieved an AUC of 0.828 in the validation set
but did not generalised well for the test set which consist of 146 patients
from a different centre to the training data (AUC = 0.69). Our preliminary
results show that deep learning may offer prognostication of disease
progression of NPC patients after treatment. One advantage of our model is that
it does not require manual segmentation of the region of interest, hence
reducing clinician's burden. Further development in generalising multicentre

relative to a basis has a branch which is good. This combinatorial property
turns out to be very strong and is equivalent to the space being $1$-asymptotic

is to investigate some conditions for occurrence of TI and formation of
pre-condensations through the outer half a quasi-static spherical molecular
clump or core. The inner half is nearly singular and ambiguous so out of scope
of this research. We consider a spherically symmetric molecular cloud in
quasi-static and thermally equilibrium state, and we use the linear
perturbation method to investigate occurrence of TI through its outer half. The
origin of perturbations are assumed to be as Inside-Rush-Perturbation (IRP)
with outward perturbed velocity at inner region of the cloud, and
Outside-Rush-Perturbation (ORP) with inward perturbed velocity originated at
the outer parts of the cloud. The local thermal balance at the outer half of
the molecular cloud leads to a local loosely constrained power-law relation
between the pressure and density as $p \propto \rho^{1+\chi}$, where
$-0.4\lesssim \chi\lesssim 0.05$ depends on the functional form of the net
cooling function. Physically, the value of $\chi$ depends on the power of
dependence of magnetic field to the density, $\eta$, and also on the value of
magnetic field gradient, $\zeta$. For strong magnetic field (smaller $\eta$)
and/or large field gradient (greater $\zeta$), the value of $\chi$ decreases,
and vice versa. The results show that increasing of the value of $\chi$ leads
to form a flatter density profiles at the thermally equilibrium outer half of
the molecular clump or core, and to occur more thermally unstable IRP and ORP
with smaller growth time-scales, and vice versa.

ubiquitous computing, health, and well-being. Specifically, the area of human
activity recognition (HAR) is primarily transformed by the convolutional and
recurrent neural networks, thanks to their ability to learn semantic
representations from raw input. However, to extract generalizable features,
massive amounts of well-curated data are required, which is a notoriously
challenging task; hindered by privacy issues, and annotation costs. Therefore,
unsupervised representation learning is of prime importance to leverage the
vast amount of unlabeled data produced by smart devices. In this work, we
propose a novel self-supervised technique for feature learning from sensory
data that does not require access to any form of semantic labels. We learn a
multi-task temporal convolutional network to recognize transformations applied
on an input signal. By exploiting these transformations, we demonstrate that
simple auxiliary tasks of the binary classification result in a strong
supervisory signal for extracting useful features for the downstream task. We
extensively evaluate the proposed approach on several publicly available
datasets for smartphone-based HAR in unsupervised, semi-supervised, and
transfer learning settings. Our method achieves performance levels superior to
or comparable with fully-supervised networks, and it performs significantly
better than autoencoders. Notably, for the semi-supervised case, the
self-supervised features substantially boost the detection rate by attaining a
kappa score between 0.7-0.8 with only 10 labeled examples per class. We get
similar impressive performance even if the features are transferred from a
different data source. While this paper focuses on HAR as the application
domain, the proposed technique is general and could be applied to a wide
variety of problems in other areas.

information regarding the blur kernel. As deblurring can be considered as an
image to image translation task, deep learning based solutions, including the
ones which use GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), have been proven effective
for deblurring. Most of them have an encoder-decoder structure. Our objective
is to try different GAN structures and improve its performance through various
modifications to the existing structure for supervised deblurring. In
supervised deblurring we have pairs of blurred and their corresponding sharp
images, while in the unsupervised case we have a set of blurred and sharp
images but their is no correspondence between them. Modifications to the
structures is done to improve the global perception of the model. As blur is
non-uniform in nature, for deblurring we require global information of the
entire image, whereas convolution used in CNN is able to provide only local
perception. Deep models can be used to improve global perception but due to
large number of parameters it becomes difficult for it to converge and
inference time increases, to solve this we propose the use of attention module
(non-local block) which was previously used in language translation and other
image to image translation tasks in deblurring. Use of residual connection also
improves the performance of deblurring as features from the lower layers are
added to the upper layers of the model. It has been found that classical losses
like L1, L2, and perceptual loss also help in training of GANs when added
together with adversarial loss. We also concatenate edge information of the
image to observe its effects on deblurring. We also use feedback modules to
retain long term dependencies

stopping behaviour with 70\% accuracy 0.38 seconds before the actual events,
our system achieves such accuracy at least 0.9 seconds on an average before the

  Invalid Instrumental Variable","To appear in Journal of Machine Learning Research",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Instrumental variable methods have been widely used to identify causal
effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. A key identification
condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the instrument cannot
have a direct effect on the outcome which is not mediated by the exposure in
view. In the health and social sciences, such an assumption is often not
credible. To address this concern, we consider identification conditions of the
population average treatment effect with an invalid instrumental variable which
does not satisfy the exclusion restriction, and derive the efficient influence
function targeting the identifying functional under a nonparametric observed
data model. We propose a novel multiply robust locally efficient estimator of
the average treatment effect that is consistent in the union of multiple
parametric nuisance models, as well as a multiply debiased machine learning
estimator for which the nuisance parameters are estimated using generic machine
learning methods, that effectively exploit various forms of linear or nonlinear
structured sparsity in the nuisance parameter space. When one cannot be
confident that any of these machine learners is consistent at sufficiently fast
rates to ensure $\surd{n}$-consistency for the average treatment effect, we
introduce a new criteria for selective machine learning which leverages the
multiple robustness property in order to ensure small bias. The proposed
methods are illustrated through extensive simulations and a data analysis
evaluating the causal effect of 401(k) participation on savings.

estimate $r_{\rm t}$, the physical tidal radius of low-mass stars is larger by
tens of percent, while for high-mass stars ($M_{\star} \gtrsim1~ {\rm

range of energies found in the debris is approximately accurate for low-mass
stars, but is a factor $\sim 2$ too small for high-mass stars; in addition, the
energy distribution for high-mass stars has significant wings. For all stars
undergoing tidal encounters, we find that mass-loss continues for a long time
because the ${\it instantaneous}$ tidal radius, the distance out to which the
black hole's tidal gravity competes with the instantaneous stellar gravity at
the star's surface, stays comparable to the distance to the black hole until
the star has reached $O(10)~r_{\rm t}$. These findings indicate significant

accomplished mainly by firstly extracting image features through convolutional
neural network (CNN) model pre-trained on computer vision task, and secondly
training a linear regression model to map specific layer of CNN features to
each voxel, namely voxel-wise encoding. However, the two-step manner model,
essentially, is hard to determine which kind of well features are well linearly
matched for beforehand unknown fMRI data with little understanding of human
visual representation. Analogizing computer vision mostly related human vision,
we proposed the end-to-end convolution regression model (ETECRM) in the region
of interest (ROI)-wise manner to accomplish effective and efficient visual
encoding. The end-to-end manner was introduced to make the model automatically
learn better matching features to improve encoding performance. The ROI-wise
manner was used to improve the encoding efficiency for many voxels. In
addition, we designed the selective optimization including self-adapting weight
learning and weighted correlation loss, noise regularization to avoid
interfering of ineffective voxels in ROI-wise encoding. Experiment demonstrated
that the proposed model obtained better predicting accuracy than the two-step
manner of encoding models. Comparative analysis implied that end-to-end manner

encoding.

experts of the respective fields, and they are highly reusable and may be
subjected to formal analysis. Typically, behavior is defined as the occurrence
of an action, a pattern over time, or any change in or movement of an object.
In systems studies, there are many different approaches to modeling behavior,
such as grounding behavior simultaneously on state transitions, natural
language, and flowcharts. These different descriptions make it difficult to
compare objects with each other for consistency. This paper attempts to propose
some conceptual preliminaries to a definition of behavior in software
engineering. The main objective is to clarify the research area concerned with
system behavior aspects and to create a common platform for future research.
Five generic elementary processes (creating, processing, releasing, receiving,
and transferring) are used to form a unifying higher-order process called a
thinging machine (TM) that is utilized as a template in modeling behavior of
systems. Additionally, a TM includes memory and triggering relations among
stages of processes (machines). A TM is applied to many examples from the
literature to examine their behavioristic aspects. The results show that a TM
is a valuable tool for analyzing and modeling behavior in a system.

DIFFVC framework, a model that can estimate the spectral differential from the
F0 transformed input speech needs to be trained beforehand. This requirement
imposes several constraints, including a limitation on the estimation model to
parallel training and the need of extra training on each conversion pair, which
make DIFFVC inflexible. Based on the above motivations, we propose a new DIFFVC
framework based on an F0 transformation in the residual domain. By performing
inverse filtering on the input signal followed by synthesis filtering on the F0
transformed residual signal using the converted spectral features directly, the
spectral conversion model does not need to be retrained or capable of
predicting the spectral differential. We describe several details that need to
be taken care of under this modification, and by applying our proposed method
to a non-parallel, variational autoencoder (VAE)-based spectral conversion

Coder (CABAC) to the network's parameters, which was originally designed for
the H.264/AVC video coding standard and became the state-of-the-art for

impact of quantization onto the accuracy of the network into account.
Experimental results show that DeepCABAC consistently attains higher

x63.6 with no loss of accuracy, thus being able to represent the entire network

interaction, the generalized spin-orbit interaction (GSOI). It expresses the
magnetic field induced by two charged particles moving with a non-zero relative
velocity as a field defined at all points in space, and exists in the reference
frames of both particles. This is in contrast to spin-orbit interaction theory,
in which the generated magnetic field is defined at only one point in space,
and exists in the reference frame of one of the two particles. At the
macroscopic scale, it is shown that the GSOI theory implies the same form of
the \O{}rsted magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire. However, the
theory is incompatible with the microscopic form of the Biot-Savart equation
that implies that a charged particle induces a magnetic field by having a
non-zero velocity. The implications of the GSOI theory on properties of the
\O{}rsted magnetic field in current-carrying atomically thin two-dimensional
materials, such as graphene, are discussed. The framework established in this

environment are often framed as quadratic programming (QP) optimization
problems. Common drawbacks of such QP based controllers are: the control input
often experiences discontinuities; no force feedback from Force/Torque (FT)
sensors installed on the robot is taken into account. This paper attempts to
address these limitations using jerk based control architectures. The proposed
controllers assume the rate-of-change of the joint torques as control input,
and exploit the system position, velocity, accelerations, and contact wrenches
as measurable quantities. The key ingredient of the presented approach is a
one-to-one correspondence between free variables and an inner approximation of
the manifold defined by the contact stability constraints. More precisely, the
proposed correspondence covers completely the contact stability manifold except
for the so-called friction cone, for which there exists a unique correspondence
for more than 90% of its elements. The correspondence allows us to transform
the underlying constrained optimisation problem into one that is unconstrained.
Then, we propose a jerk control framework that exploits the proposed
correspondence and uses FT measurements in the control loop. Furthermore, we
present Lyapunov stable controllers for the system momentum in the jerk control
framework. The approach is validated with simulations and experiments using the
iCub humanoid robot.

random algebraic method. However, the random algebraic method usually requires
some parameters to be very large, hence we are concerned about how these
Tur\'{a}n numbers depend on such large parameters of the forbidden hypergraphs.
In this paper, we determine the dependence on such specified large constant for
several hypergraph Tur\'{a}n problems. More specifically, for complete
$r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraphs, we show that if $s_{r}$ is sufficiently
larger than $s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{r-1},$ then
  $$\textup{ex}_{r}(n,K_{s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{r}}^{(r)})=\Theta(s_{r}^{\frac{1}{s_{1}s_{2}\cdots

sufficiently larger than $t,$ we have
  $$\textup{ex}_{r}(n,K_{s,t}^{(r)})=\Theta(s^{\frac{1}{t}}n^{r-\frac{1}{t}}).$$

$\textup{ex}(n,K_{s,t})=O(t^{\frac{1}{s}}n^{2-\frac{1}{s}})$ has the correct

multi-hypergraph via a variant of random algebraic method.

oftentimes dynamic, complex and difficult to discern. Time-course gene
expression data is a rich source of information that can be used to unravel
these complex processes, identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and predict
the response to a drug. However, the majority of previous work has not fully
utilized this temporal dimension. In these studies, the gene expression data is
either considered at one time-point (before the administration of the drug) or
two timepoints (before and after the administration of the drug). This is
clearly inadequate in modeling dynamic gene-drug interactions, especially for
applications such as long-term drug therapy.
  In this work, we present a novel REcursive Prediction (REP) framework for
drug response prediction by taking advantage of time-course gene expression
data. Our goal is to predict drug response values at every stage of a long-term
treatment, given the expression levels of genes collected in the previous
time-points. To this end, REP employs a built-in recursive structure that
exploits the intrinsic time-course nature of the data and integrates past
values of drug responses for subsequent predictions. It also incorporates
tensor completion that can not only alleviate the impact of noise and missing
data, but also predict unseen gene expression levels (GELs). These advantages
enable REP to estimate drug response at any stage of a given treatment from
some GELs measured in the beginning of the treatment. Extensive experiments on
a dataset corresponding to 53 multiple sclerosis patients treated with
interferon are included to showcase the effectiveness of REP.

methods propose priors such as smoothness, color consistency. However, the
low-level priors are not reliable in complex scenes, for instance, when
capturing a real outdoor scene through a window, both the foreground and
background contain both smooth and sharp area and a variety of color. In this
paper, inspired by the fact that human can separate the two layers easily by
recognizing the objects, we use the object semantic as guidance to force the
same semantic object belong to the same layer. Extensive experiments on

significant improvement to reflection separation. We also demonstrate the

However, previous methods either operate on a predefined set of face attributes
or leave users little freedom to interactively manipulate images. To overcome
these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework termed MaskGAN, enabling diverse
and interactive face manipulation. Our key insight is that semantic masks serve
as a suitable intermediate representation for flexible face manipulation with
fidelity preservation. MaskGAN has two main components: 1) Dense Mapping
Network (DMN) and 2) Editing Behavior Simulated Training (EBST). Specifically,
DMN learns style mapping between a free-form user modified mask and a target
image, enabling diverse generation results. EBST models the user editing
behavior on the source mask, making the overall framework more robust to
various manipulated inputs. Specifically, it introduces dual-editing
consistency as the auxiliary supervision signal. To facilitate extensive
studies, we construct a large-scale high-resolution face dataset with
fine-grained mask annotations named CelebAMask-HQ. MaskGAN is comprehensively
evaluated on two challenging tasks: attribute transfer and style copy,
demonstrating superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods. The

investigate the use of empowerment in the presence of an extrinsic reward

agents to find good early behavioral solutions by encouraging highly empowered

Bellman's optimality principle as well as recent information-theoretical
extensions to it. We prove uniqueness of the empowered values and show
convergence to the optimal solution. We then apply this idea to develop

sequence data at ever faster rates and at very low cost. Large sequencing
centers typically employ hundreds of such systems. Such high-throughput and
low-cost generation of data underscores the need for commensurate acceleration
in downstream computational analysis of the sequencing data. A fundamental step
in downstream analysis is mapping of the reads to a long reference DNA
sequence, such as a reference human genome. Sequence mapping is a
compute-intensive step that accounts for more than 30% of the overall time of
the GATK workflow. BWA-MEM is one of the most widely used tools for sequence
mapping and has tens of thousands of users.
  In this work, we focus on accelerating BWA-MEM through an efficient
architecture aware implementation, while maintaining identical output. The
volume of data requires distributed computing environment, usually deploying
multicore processors. Since the application can be easily parallelized for
distributed memory systems, we focus on performance improvements on a single
socket multicore processor. BWA-MEM run time is dominated by three kernels,
collectively responsible for more than 85% of the overall compute time. We
improved the performance of these kernels by 1) improving cache reuse, 2)
simplifying the algorithms, 3) replacing small fragmented memory allocations
with a few large contiguous ones, 4) software prefetching, and 5) SIMD
utilization wherever applicable - and massive reorganization of the source code
enabling these improvements.
  As a result, we achieved nearly 2x, 183x, and 8x speedups on the three
kernels, respectively, resulting in up to 3.5x and 2.4x speedups on end-to-end
compute time over the original BWA-MEM on single thread and single socket of
Intel Xeon Skylake processor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest
reported speedup over BWA-MEM.

inherit fundamental invariants of the manifolds such as homology groups etc.

shear nonequilibrium contributions from short-range fluctuations are no longer
negligible. In addition, it is noted that currently available computer
simulations of model fluids in shear observe effects from molecular
correlations at nanoscales that have a different physical origin and do not
probe shear-induced pressures resulting from coupling of long-wavelength

Named by the CDC as an important tool to fight the damaging effects of these
epidemics, accurate forecasts of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI)
forewarn public health officials about when, and where, seasonal influenza
outbreaks will hit hardest. Multi-model ensemble forecasts---weighted
combinations of component models---have shown positive results in forecasting.
Ensemble forecasts of influenza outbreaks have been static, training on all
past ILI data at the beginning of a season, generating a set of optimal weights
for each model in the ensemble, and keeping the weights constant. We propose an
adaptive ensemble forecast that (i) changes model weights week-by-week
throughout the influenza season, (ii) only needs the current influenza season's
data to make predictions, and (iii) by introducing a prior distribution,
shrinks weights toward the reference equal weighting approach and adjusts for
observed ILI percentages that are subject to future revisions. We investigate
the prior's ability to impact adaptive ensemble performance and, after finding
an optimal prior via a cross-validation approach, compare our adaptive
ensemble's performance to equal-weighted and static ensembles. Applied to
forecasts of short-term ILI incidence at the regional and national level in the
US, our adaptive model outperforms a naive equal-weighted ensemble, and has
similar or better performance to the static ensemble, which requires multiple
years of training data. Adaptive ensembles are able to quickly train and
forecast during epidemics, and provide a practical tool to public health
officials looking for forecasts that can conform to unique features of a
specific season.

relevance, diversity, and in many cases coherence in their generated responses.
These issues can attributed to reasons including (1) short-range model
architectures that capture limited temporal dependencies, (2) limitations of
the maximum likelihood training objective, (3) the concave entropy profile of
dialogue datasets resulting in short and generic responses, and (4) the
out-of-vocabulary problem leading to generation of a large number of <UNK>
tokens. On the other hand, transformer-based models such as GPT-2 have
demonstrated an excellent ability to capture long-range structures in language
modeling tasks. In this paper, we present DLGNet, a transformer-based model for
dialogue modeling. We specifically examine the use of DLGNet for multi-turn
dialogue response generation. In our experiments, we evaluate DLGNet on the
open-domain Movie Triples dataset and the closed-domain Ubuntu Dialogue
dataset. DLGNet models, although trained with only the maximum likelihood
objective, achieve significant improvements over state-of-the-art multi-turn
dialogue models. They also produce best performance to date on the two datasets
based on several metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and distinct n-gram. Our
analysis shows that the performance improvement is mostly due to the
combination of (1) the long-range transformer architecture with (2) the
injection of random informative paddings. Other contributing factors include
the joint modeling of dialogue context and response, and the 100% tokenization
coverage from the byte pair encoding (BPE).

Community finding field encompasses approaches which try to discover clusters
where nodes are tightly related within them but loosely related with nodes of
other clusters. However, a community network configuration is not the only
possible latent structure in a graph. Core-periphery and hierarchical network
configurations are valid structures to discover in a relational dataset. On the
other hand, a network is not completely explained by only knowing the
membership of each node. A high level view of the inter-cluster relationships
is needed. Blockmodelling techniques deal with these two issues. Firstly,
blockmodelling allows finding any network configuration besides to the
well-known community structure. Secondly, blockmodelling is a summary
representation of a network which regards not only membership of nodes but also
relations between clusters. Finally, a unique summary representation of a
network is unlikely. Networks might hide more than one blockmodel. Therefore,
our proposed problem aims to discover a secondary blockmodel representation of
a network that is of good quality and dissimilar with respect to a given
blockmodel. Our methodology is presented through two approaches, (a) inclusion
of cannot-link constraints and (b) dissimilarity between image matrices. Both
approaches are based on non-negative matrix factorisation NMF which fits the
blockmodelling representation. The evaluation of these two approaches regards
quality and dissimilarity of the discovered alternative blockmodel as these are
the requirements of the problem.

performance scientific computing, the unique characteristics of emerging DL
workloads in HPC raise great challenges in designing, implementing HPC AI

systems. In this paper, we propose HPC AI500 --- a benchmark suite for
evaluating HPC systems that running scientific DL workloads. Covering the most
representative scientific fields, each workload from HPC AI500 is based on
real-world scientific DL applications. Currently, we choose 14 scientific DL
benchmarks from perspectives of application scenarios, data sets, and software
stack. We propose a set of metrics for comprehensively evaluating the HPC AI
systems, considering both accuracy, performance as well as power and cost. We
provide a scalable reference implementation of HPC AI500. HPC AI500 is a part
of the open-source AIBench project, the specification and source code are

generated by discrete and continuous dynamical systems based on their chaotic
or non-chaotic behaviour. Our approach to circumvent the lack of precise models
for some of the most challenging real-life applications is to train different
neural networks on a data set from a dynamical system with a basic or
low-dimensional phase space and then use these networks to classify univariate
time series of a dynamical system with more intricate or high-dimensional phase
space. We illustrate this generalisation approach using the logistic map, the
sine-circle map, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We
observe that a convolutional neural network without batch normalization layers
outperforms state-of-the-art neural networks for time series classification and
is able to generalise and classify time series as chaotic or not with high
accuracy.
