learning patterns in data and making recommendations. However, these systems
are limited in that the user has little means of understanding the rationale
behind the systems suggestions, communicating their own understanding of
patterns, or correcting system behavior. In this project, we outline a model
for intelligent software based on a human computer feedback loop. The Machine
Learning (ML) systems recommendations are reviewed by the user, and in turn,
this information shapes the systems decision making. Our model was applied to
developing an HTML editor that integrates ML with user interaction to ascertain
structural relationships between HTML document features and apply them for code
completion. The editor utilizes the ID3 algorithm to build decision trees,
sequences of rules for predicting code the user will type. The editor displays
the decision trees rules in the Interactive Rules Interface System (IRIS),
which allows developers to prioritize, modify, or delete them. These
interactions alter the data processed by ID3, providing the developer some
control over the autocomplete system. Validation indicates that, absent user
interaction, the ML model is able to predict tags with 78.4 percent accuracy,
attributes with 62.9 percent accuracy, and values with 12.8 percent accuracy.
Based off of the results of the user study, user interaction with the rules
interface corrects feature relationships missed or mistaken by the automated
process, enhancing autocomplete accuracy and developer productivity.
Additionally, interaction is proven to help developers work with greater
awareness of code patterns. Our research demonstrates the viability of a
software integration of machine intelligence with human feedback.

fundamental inhomogeneous $gl_{\mathcal{M}|\mathcal{N}}$ supersymmetric
integrable models and for the inhomogeneous Hubbard model both defined with
quasi-periodic twisted boundary conditions given by twist matrices having
simple spectrum. The SoV bases are obtained by using the integrable structure
of these quantum models,i.e. the associated commuting transfer matrices,
following the general scheme introduced in [1]; namely, they are given by set
of states generated by the multiple action of the transfer matrices on a
generic co-vector. The existence of such SoV bases implies that the
corresponding transfer matrices have non degenerate spectrum and that they are
diagonalizable with simple spectrum if the twist matrices defining the
quasi-periodic boundary conditions have that property. Moreover, in these SoV
bases the resolution of the transfer matrix eigenvalue problem leads to the
resolution of the full spectral problem, i.e. both eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. Indeed, to any eigenvalue is associated the unique (up to a
trivial overall normalization) eigenvector whose wave-function in the SoV bases
is factorized into products of the corresponding transfer matrix eigenvalue
computed on the spectrum of the separate variables. As an application, we
characterize completely the transfer matrix spectrum in our SoV framework for
the fundamental $gl_{1|2}$ supersymmetric integrable model associated to a
special class of twist matrices. From these results we also prove the
completeness of the Bethe Ansatz for that case. The complete solution of the
spectral problem for fundamental inhomogeneous $gl_{\mathcal{M}|\mathcal{N}}$
supersymmetric integrable models and for the inhomogeneous Hubbard model under
the general twisted boundary conditions will be addressed in a future

new opportunities for providing aggregated flexibility services to both
distribution system operators and balance responsible parties. The optimization
problem presented in this paper is formulated with an objective of cost
minimization which includes energy and battery degradation cost to provide
flexibility services. A decomposed solution approach with the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used instead of commonly adopted
centralised optimization to reduce the computational burden and time, and then
reduce scalability limitations. In this work we apply a modified version of
ADMM that includes two new features with respect to the original algorithm:
first, the primal variables are updated concurrently, which reduces
significantly the computational cost when we have a large number of involved
prosumers; second, it includes a regularization term named Proximal Jacobian
(PJ) that ensures the stability of the solution. A case study is presented for
optimal battery operation of 100 prosumer sites with real-life data. The
proposed method finds a solution which is equivalent to the centralised
optimization problem and is computed between 5 and 12 times faster. Thus,
aggregators or large-scale energy communities can use this scalable algorithm
to provide flexibility services.

support and co-variate overlap) is necessary to obtain valid causal estimates.
Therefore, confirming it holds in a given dataset is an important first step of
any causal analysis. Most common methods to date are insufficient for
discovering non-positivity, as they do not scale for modern high-dimensional
covariate spaces, or they cannot pinpoint the subpopulation violating
positivity. To overcome these issues, we suggest to harness decision trees for
detecting violations. By dividing the covariate space into mutually exclusive
regions, each with maximized homogeneity of treatment groups, decision trees
can be used to automatically detect subspaces violating positivity. By
augmenting the method with an additional random forest model, we can quantify
the robustness of the violation within each subspace. This solution is scalable
and provides an interpretable characterization of the subspaces in which
violations occur. We provide a visualization of the stratification rules that
define each subpopulation, combined with the severity of positivity violation
within it. We also provide an interactive version of the visualization that
allows a deeper dive into the properties of each subspace.

algorithm, called self-consistent robust artificial-neural-networks for k-space
interpolation (sRAKI). sRAKI performs iterative parallel imaging reconstruction
by enforcing coil self-consistency using subject-specific neural networks. This
approach extends the linear convolutions in SPIRiT to nonlinear interpolation
using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These CNNs are trained individually
for each scan using the scan-specific autocalibrating signal (ACS) data.
Reconstruction is performed by imposing the learned self-consistency and
data-consistency enabling sRAKI to support random undersampling patterns.
Fully-sampled targeted right coronary artery MRI was acquired in six healthy
subjects for evaluation. The data were retrospectively undersampled, and
reconstructed using SPIRiT, $\ell_1$-SPIRiT and sRAKI for acceleration rates of
2 to 5. Additionally, prospectively undersampled whole-heart coronary MRI was
acquired to further evaluate performance. The results indicate that sRAKI
reduces noise amplification and blurring artifacts compared with SPIRiT and
$\ell_1$-SPIRiT, especially at high acceleration rates in targeted data.
Quantitative analysis shows that sRAKI improves normalized mean-squared-error
(~44% and ~21% over SPIRiT and $\ell_1$-SPIRiT at rate 5) and vessel sharpness
(~10% and ~20% over SPIRiT and $\ell_1$-SPIRiT at rate 5). In addition,
whole-heart data shows the sharpest coronary arteries when resolved using
sRAKI, with 11% and 15% improvement in vessel sharpness over SPIRiT and
$\ell_1$-SPIRiT, respectively. Thus, sRAKI is a database-free neural
network-based reconstruction technique that may further accelerate coronary MRI
with arbitrary undersampling patterns, while improving noise resilience over
linear parallel imaging and image sharpness over $\ell_1$ regularization
techniques.

algorithms for preparing approximate ground states in near-term quantum
devices. Minimizing the error in such an approximation requires designing
ansatzes using physical considerations that target the studied system. One such
consideration is size-extensivity, meaning that the ground state quantum
correlations are to be compactly represented in the ansatz. On digital quantum
computers, however, the size-extensive ansatzes usually require expansion via
Trotter-Suzuki methods. These introduce additional costs and errors to the
approximation. In this work, we present a diagrammatic scheme for the digital
VQE ansatzes, which is size-extensive but does not rely on Trotterization. We
start by designing a family of digital ansatzes that explore the entire Hilbert
space with the minimum number of free parameters. We then demonstrate how one
may compress an arbitrary digital ansatz, by enforcing symmetry constraints of
the target system, or by using them as parent ansatzes for a hierarchy of
increasingly long but increasingly accurate sub-ansatzes. We apply a
perturbative analysis and develop a diagrammatic formalism that ensures the
size-extensivity of generated hierarchies. We test our methods on a short spin
chain, finding good convergence to the ground state in the paramagnetic and the
ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising model.

  - We prove a volume hierarchy theorem for randomized complexity: among
problems with linear deterministic volume complexity, there are infinitely many
distinct randomized volume complexity classes between $\Omega(\log n)$ and
$O(n)$. This hierarchy persists even when restricting to problems whose
randomized and deterministic distance complexities are $\Theta(\log n)$.

core subject of study of social choice theory. In 2006, Procaccia and
Rosenschein considered a utilitarian social choice setting, where the agents
have explicit numerical values for the alternatives, yet they only report their
linear orderings over them. To compare different aggregation mechanisms,
Procaccia and Rosenschein introduced the notion of distortion, which quantifies
the inefficiency of using only ordinal information when trying to maximize the
social welfare, i.e., the sum of the underlying values of the agents for the
chosen outcome. Since then, this research area has flourished and bounds on the
distortion have been obtained for a wide variety of fundamental scenarios.
However, the vast majority of the existing literature is focused on the case
where nothing is known beyond the ordinal preferences of the agents over the
alternatives. In this paper, we take a more expressive approach, and consider
mechanisms that are allowed to further ask a few cardinal queries in order to
gain partial access to the underlying values that the agents have for the
alternatives. With this extra power, we design new deterministic mechanisms
that achieve significantly improved distortion bounds and, in many cases,
outperform the best-known randomized ordinal mechanisms. We paint an almost
complete picture of the number of queries required by deterministic mechanisms
to achieve specific distortion bounds.

The most
voluminous sedimentary rocks that formed during Mars' Hesperian period are
sulfate-rich rocks, explored by the $Opportunity$ rover from 2004-2012 and soon
to be investigated by the $Curiosity$ rover at Gale crater. A leading
hypothesis for the origin of these sulfates is that the cations were derived
from evaporation of deep-sourced groundwater, as part of a global circulation
of groundwater. Global groundwater circulation would imply sustained warm
Earthlike conditions on Early Mars. Global circulation of groundwater including
infiltration of water initially in equilibrium with Mars' CO$_2$ atmosphere
implies subsurface formation of carbonate. We find that the CO$_2$
sequestration implied by the global groundwater hypothesis for the origin of
sulfate-rich rocks on Mars is 30-5000 bars if the $Opportunity$ data are
representative of Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks, which is so large that (even
accounting for volcanic outgassing) it would bury the atmosphere. This
disfavors the hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were
derived from upwelling of deep sourced groundwater. If, instead, Hesperian
sulfate-rich rocks are approximated as pure Mg-sulfate (no Fe), then the CO$_2$
sequestration is 0.3-400 bars. The low end of this range is consistent with the
hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from
upwelling of deep sourced groundwater. In both cases, carbon sequestration by
global groundwater circulation actively works to terminate surface
habitability, rather than being a passive marker of warm Earthlike conditions.
$Curiosity$ will soon be in a position to discriminate between these two
hypotheses. Our work links Mars sulfate cation composition, carbon isotopes,
and climate change.

In
this paper, we introduce Uber's smart reply system: one-click-chat (OCC), which
is a key enhanced feature on top of the Uber in-app chat system. It enables
driver-partners to quickly respond to rider messages using smart replies. The
smart replies are dynamically selected according to conversation content using
machine learning algorithms. Our system consists of two major components:
intent detection and reply retrieval, which are very different from standard
smart reply systems where the task is to directly predict a reply. It is
designed specifically for mobile applications with short and non-canonical
messages. Reply retrieval utilizes pairings between intent and reply based on
their popularity in chat messages as derived from historical data. For intent
detection, a set of embedding and classification techniques are experimented
with, and we choose to deploy a solution using unsupervised distributed
embedding and nearest-neighbor classifier. It has the advantage of only
requiring a small amount of labeled training data, simplicity in developing and
deploying to production, and fast inference during serving and hence highly
scalable. At the same time, it performs comparably with deep learning
architectures such as word-level convolutional neural network. Overall, the
system achieves a high accuracy of 76% on intent detection. Currently, the
system is deployed in production for English-speaking countries and 71% of
in-app communications between riders and driver-partners adopted the smart
replies to speedup the communication process.

plasma systems. The wave-induced misbalance between plasma cooling and heating
processes causes the amplification or attenuation, and also dispersion, of slow
magnetoacoustic waves. The wave dispersion could be attributed to the presence
of characteristic time scales in the system, connected with the plasma heating
or cooling due to the competition of the heating and cooling processes in the
vicinity of the thermal equilibrium. We analysed linear slow magnetoacoustic
waves in a plasma in a thermal equilibrium formed by a balance of optically
thin radiative losses, field-align thermal conduction, and an unspecified
heating. The dispersion is manifested by the dependence of the effective
adiabatic index of the wave on the wave frequency, making the phase and group
speeds frequency-dependent. The mutual effect of the wave amplification and
dispersion is shown to result into the occurrence of an oscillatory pattern in
an initially broadband slow wave, with the characteristic period determined by
the thermal misbalance time scales, i.e. by the derivatives of the combined
radiation loss and heating function with respect to the density and
temperature, evaluated at the equilibrium. This effect is illustrated by
estimating the characteristic period of the oscillatory pattern, appearing
because of thermal misbalance in the plasma of the solar corona. It is found
that by an order of magnitude the period is about the typical periods of slow
magnetoacoustic oscillations detected in the corona.

extremal behaviors among all configurations of points in $\mathbb P_k^n$;
additional interest come from their rich structure, which allows them to be
studied using tools from algebraic geometry, combinatorics, commutative algebra
and representation theory. In the present paper we investigate the more general
problem of determining the structure of symbolic powers of a wide
generalization of star configurations of points (introduced by Geramita,
Harbourne, Migliore and Nagel) called star configurations of hypersurfaces in
$\mathbb P_k^n$. Here (1) we provide explicit minimal generating sets of the
symbolic powers $I^{(m)}$ of these ideals $I$, (2) we introduce a notion of
$\delta$-c.i. quotients, which generalize ideals with linear quotients, and
show that $I^{(m)}$ have $\delta$-c.i. quotients, (3) we show that the shape of
the Betti tables of these symbolic powers is determined by certain ""Koszul""
strands and we prove that a little bit more than the bottom half of the Betti
table has a regular, almost hypnotic, pattern, and (4) we provide a closed
formula for all the graded Betti numbers in these strands. As a special case of
(2) we deduce that symbolic powers of ideals of star configurations of points
have linear quotients. We also improve and extend results by Galetto, Geramita,
Shin and Van Tuyl, and provide explicit new general formulas for the minimal
number of generators and the symbolic defects of star configurations. Finally,
inspired by Young tableaux, we introduce a technical tool which may be of
independent interest: it is a ""canonical"" way of writing any monomial in any
given set of polynomials. Our methods are characteristic--free.

For polar configurations around binaries with mass ratios $q$ below $0.7$, the

with respect to rocky earth-like planets. For equal mass stars, the
eccentricity excitation $\Delta e$ of polar orbits smoothly increases with
decreasing distance to the binary. For $q<1$, $\Delta e$ can reach values as

compared to the energy needed to detach a single joined debris particle or

$NTIME[O(n)]$ with a $O(\log n)$ additive loss in the query complexity $q$. We
show our result by constructing a ""robust circuit"" using threshold gates. These
results are a gap amplification procedure for PCPs (when completeness is
imperfect), analogous to questions studied in parallel repetition and
pseudorandomness.
  We also investigate the time complexity of approximating perfectly
satisfiable instances of 3SAT versus those with imperfect completeness. We show
that the Gap-ETH conjecture without perfect completeness is equivalent to
Gap-ETH with perfect completeness, i.e. we show that Gap-3SAT, where the gap is
not around 1, has a subexponential algorithm, if and only if, Gap-3SAT with
perfect completeness has subexponential algorithms. We also relate the time
complexities of these two problems in a more fine-grained way, to show that
$T_2(n) \leq T_1(n(\log\log n)^{O(1)})$, where $T_1(n),T_2(n)$ denote the
randomized time-complexity of approximating MAX 3SAT with perfect and imperfect
completeness, respectively.

to serve as a very expressive variational ansatz for quantum many-body systems.
Here we study the main factors governing the applicability of NQS to frustrated
magnets by training neural networks to approximate ground states of several
moderately-sized Hamiltonians using the corresponding wavefunction structure on
a small subset of the Hilbert space basis as training dataset. We notice that
generalization quality, i.e. the ability to learn from a limited number of
samples and correctly approximate the target state on the rest of the space,
drops abruptly when frustration is increased. We also show that learning the
sign structure is considerably more difficult than learning amplitudes.
Finally, we conclude that the main issue to be addressed at this stage, in
order to use the method of NQS for simulating realistic models, is that of
generalization rather than expressibility.

the general classification of topological phases with spatial symmetries and

recent works on ""SPT-LSM"" theorems where the system admits a gapped symmetric

still be non-trivial in the sense of symmetry-protected topological (SPT)

separation is shorter than the ""tidal radius"". This quantity is often estimated
on an order-of-magnitude basis without reference to the star's internal
structure. Using MESA models for main sequence stars and fully general
relativistic dynamics, we find the physical tidal radius for complete
disruption $\cal{R}_t$ for a $10^6M_\odot$ black hole (BH). We find that across
a factor $\sim20$ in stellar mass $M_*$, i.e., $0.15M_{\odot}\leq
M_*\leq3M_\odot$, $\cal{R}_t\sim27\times$(BH's gravitational radius). When
comparing $\cal{R}_t$ with the commonly used order-of-magnitude estimate $r_t$,
we find that $\cal{R}_t\sim1.05-1.45r_t$ for $0.15M_\odot\leq
M_*\leq0.5M_\odot$, but between $0.5 M_\odot$ and $1 M_\odot$, $\cal{R}_t$
drops to $\sim 0.45r_t$, and it remains at this value up to $10 M_\odot$. The
near-constancy of $\cal{R}_t$ implies a weaker dependence of the full
disruption rate on $M_*$ than when predicted with $r_t$. The characteristic
energy width of the debris $\Delta E$ ranges from $\sim1.2\Delta\cal{E}$ for
low-mass stars to $\sim 0.35\Delta\cal{E}$ for higher-mass stars, where
$\Delta\cal{E}=GM_{\rm BH}R_*/\cal{R}_t^{2}$. We present analytic fits for the
$M_*$ dependence of $\cal{R}_t$ and $\Delta E$; these fits lead to analytic
expressions for the time of peak mass fallback rate and the maximal mass
fallback rate. Our results also bear on the fraction of events leading to fast
or slow circularization, as well as on the character of the tidal event
occurring when the remnant of a partial disruption returns to the black hole.
Using a semi-analytic model, we show that $\cal{R}_t$ is primarily determined
by the star's central density rather than its mean density. For high-mass
stars, the full disruption rate is roughly 1/4 the partial disruption rate,
while this ratio is close to unity for low-mass stars.

dissipation of the accretion energy is determined simply by energy
considerations. Here we draw attention to the fact that while the
(quasi-)steady discs in dwarf novae in outburst are in agreement with the
expected emission distribution, the steady discs in the nova-like variables are
not. We note that essentially the only difference between these two sets of
discs is the time for which they have been in the high viscosity, high
accretion rate state. In such discs, the major process by which angular
momentum is transported outwards is MHD turbulence. We speculate that such
turbulence gives rise to corona-like structures (here called magnetically
controlled zones, or MCZs) which are also able to provide non-negligible
angular momentum transport, the magnitude of which depends on the spatial scale
$L$ of the magnetic field structures in such zones. For short-lived, high
accretion rate discs (such as those in dwarf novae) we expect $L \sim H$ and
the MCZ to have little effect. But, with time (such as in the nova-like
variables) an inverse cascade in the MHD turbulence enables $L$, and the net
effect of the MCZ, to grow. We present a simple toy model which demonstrates
that such ideas can provide an explanation for the difference between the dwarf
novae and the nova-like variable discs.

Hamiltonian with finite energy density, leads to absence of ergodicity and
long-time coherent dynamics in closed quantum systems starting from simple
initial states. Such non-ergodic coherent dynamics, where the system does not
explore its entire phase space, has been experimentally observed in a chain of
ultracold Rydberg atoms. We show, via study of a periodically driven Rydberg
chain, that the drive frequency acts as a tuning parameter for several
reentrant transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic regimes. The former
regime shows rapid thermalization of correlation functions and absence of scars
in the spectrum of the system's Floquet Hamiltonian. The latter regime, in
contrast, has scars in its Floquet spectrum which control the long-time
coherent dynamics of correlation functions. Our results open a new possibility
of drive frequency-induced tuning between ergodic and non-ergodic dynamics in
experimentally realizable disorder-free quantum many-body systems.

sources in galaxies and strong candidates for intermediate-mass black holes
(IMBHs). We have constructed a sample of 169 HLX candidates by combining X-ray
detections from the Chandra Source Catalog (Version 2) with galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and registering individual images for improved
relative astrometric accuracy. The spatial resolution of Chandra allows for the
sample to extend out to z~0.9. Optical counterparts are detected among
one-fourth of the sample, one-third of which are consistent with dwarf galaxy
stellar masses. The average intrinsic X-ray spectral slope indicates efficient
accretion, potentially driven by galaxy mergers, and the column densities
suggest one-third of the sample has significant X-ray absorption. We find that
144 of the HLX candidates have X-ray emission that is significantly in excess
of the expected contribution from star formation and hot gas, strongly
suggesting that they are produced by accretion onto black holes more massive
than stars. After correcting for an average background or foreground
contamination rate of 8%, we estimate that at least ~20 of the HLX candidates
are consistent with IMBH masses, and this estimate is potentially several times
higher assuming more efficient accretion. This catalog currently represents the
largest sample of uniformly-selected, off-nuclear IMBH candidates. These
sources may represent scenarios in which a low-mass galaxy hosting an IMBH has
merged with a more massive galaxy and provide an excellent sample for testing
models of low-mass BH formation and merger-driven growth.

The deuterium fraction in low-mass prestellar cores is a good
diagnostic indicator of the initial phases of star formations, and it is also a
fundamental quantity to infer the ionisation degree in these objects.
  Aims. With the analysis of multiple transitions of $\rm N_2H^+$, $\rm
N_2D^+$, $\rm HC^{18}O^+$ and $\rm DCO^+$ we are able to determine the
molecular column density maps and the deuterium fraction in $\rm N_2H^+$ and
$\rm HCO^+$ toward the prototypical prestellar core L1544. This is the
preliminary step to derive the ionisation degree in the source.
  Methods. We use a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative
transfer code, combined with the molecular abundances derived from a chemical
model, to infer the excitation conditions of all the observed transitions,
which allows us to derive reliable maps of each molecule's column density. The
ratio between the column density of a deuterated species and its non-deuterated
counterpart gives the searched deuteration level.
  Results. The non-LTE analysis confirms that, for the analysed molecules,
higher-J transitions are characterised by excitation temperatures $\approx
1-2\,$K lower than the lower-J ones. The chemical model that provides the best
fit to the observational data predict the depletion of $\rm N_2H^+$ and to a
lesser extent of $\rm N_2D^+$ in the innermost region. The peak values for the
deuterium fraction that we find are $\mathrm{D/H_{N_2H^+}} =
0.26^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$ and $\mathrm{D/H_{HCO^+}} = 0.035^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, in
good agreement with previous estimates in the source.

entering the precursor of an unmagnetized, relativistic collisionless pair
shock. We discuss how this background plasma is decelerated and heated through
its interaction with a microturbulence that results from the growth of a
current filamentation instability (CFI) in the shock precursor. We make use, in
particular, of the reference frame $\mathcal R_{\rm w}$ in which the turbulence
is mostly magnetic. This frame moves at relativistic velocities towards the
shock front at rest, decelerating gradually from the far to the near precursor.
In a first part, we construct a fluid model to derive the deceleration law of
the background plasma expected from the scattering of suprathermal particles
off the microturbulence. This law leads to the relationship $\gamma_{\rm
p}\,\sim\,\xi_{\rm b}^{-1/2}$ between the background plasma Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{\rm p}$ and the normalized pressure of the beam $\xi_{\rm b}$; it is
found to match nicely the spatial profiles observed in large-scale 2D3V
particle-in-cell simulations. In a second part, we model the dynamics of the
background plasma at the kinetic level, incorporating the inertial effects
associated with the deceleration of $\mathcal R_{\rm w}$ into a
Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation for pitch-angle diffusion. We show how the
effective gravity in $\mathcal R_{\rm w}$ drives the background plasma
particles through friction on the microturbulence, leading to efficient plasma
heating. Finally, we compare a Monte Carlo simulation of our model with
dedicated PIC simulations and conclude that it can satisfactorily reproduce
both the heating and the deceleration of the background plasma in the shock
precursor, thereby providing a successful 1D description of the shock
transition at the microscopic level.

significant differences between NMR and crystal structures---in the

of core residues. In contrast to prior studies, we identify the physical basis
for these differences by modelling protein cores as jammed packings of
amino-acid-shaped particles. We find that we can tune the jammed packing
fraction by varying the degree of thermalization used to generate the packings.
For an athermal protocol, we find that the average jammed packing fraction is
identical to that observed in the cores of protein structures solved by x-ray
crystallography. In contrast, highly thermalized packing-generation protocols
yield jammed packing fractions that are even higher than those observed in NMR
structures. These results indicate that thermalized systems can pack more

result is complemented by a theoretical argument showing that, also for an open
three-level quantum system, the existence of an out-of-equilibrium steady state
dictates a unique time-independent value of the energy scale factor for which
the fluctuation relation is verified. Our findings pave the way to the
investigation of energy exchange mechanisms in arbitrary open quantum systems.

rather straightforward, it is very challenging to find the lexicographically

with the FM thickness? (iv) Does the crystalline quality of the FM matters? (v)
What is the effect of spinterface on magnetization reversal, domain structure
and anisotropy? In this context, we have tried to answer the last three issues
in this paper by studying Fe/C$_{60}$ bilayers of variable Fe thickness
deposited on Si substrates. We find that both the induced moment and thickness
of the spinterface vary proportionally with the Fe thickness. Such behavior is
explained in terms of the growth quality of the Fe layer on the native oxide of
the Si (100) substrate. The magnetization reversal, domain structure and
anisotropy of these bilayer samples were studied and compared with their
respective reference samples without having the C$_{60}$ layer. It is observed
that the formation of spinterface leads to reduction in uniaxial anisotropy in
Fe/C$_{60}$ on Si (100) in comparison to their reference samples.

gravity that has led to the resolution of classical singularities such as the
big bang, and those at the center of black holes. This can be seen through
numerical simulations involving the quantum Hamiltonian constraint that is a
partial difference equation. The equation allows one to study the evolution of
sharply-peaked Gaussian wave packets that generically exhibit a quantum
""bounce"" or a non-singular passage through the classical singularity, thus
offering complete singularity resolution. In addition, von-Neumann stability
analysis of the difference equation -- treated as a stencil for a numerical
solution that steps through the triad variables -- yields useful constraints on
the model and the allowed space of states. In this paper, we develop a new
method for the numerical solution of loop quantum cosmology models using a set
of basis functions that offer a number of advantages over computing a solution
by stepping through the triad variables. We use the Corichi and Singh model for
the Schwarzschild interior as the main case study in this effort. The main
advantage of this new method is computational efficiency and the ease of
parallelization. In addition, we also discuss how the stability analysis

Despite its wide use, however, it has long been recognized that the method has
a fundamental flaw: it only works on networks that are free of short loops.
Loops introduce correlations that cause the method to give inaccurate answers
at best, and to fail completely in the worst cases. Unfortunately, almost all
real-world networks contain many short loops, which limits the usefulness of
the message passing approach. In this paper we demonstrate how to rectify this
shortcoming and create message passing methods that work on any network. We
give two example applications, one to the percolation properties of networks

and thus of ""the right"" transport between source and target observations. When
the source-target observations are not bijective (when the manifold is not the

them give rise to density singularities, or because it marginalizes over
several observables), recovery of the manifold is obscured. Using ideas from
attractor reconstruction in dynamical systems, we demonstrate how additional

us recover the underlying manifold. The types of additional information
employed and the relation to optimal transport based solely on density

large spaces in order to learn. Additionally, structured discrete domains are
often characterized by strict constraints on what constitutes a valid object
and generative models must respect these requirements in order to produce
useful novel samples. Here, we present a generative model for discrete objects
employing a Markov chain where transitions are restricted to a set of local

of denoising autoencoders, the Markov chain alternates between producing 1) a
sequence of corrupted objects that are valid but not from the data
distribution, and 2) a learned reconstruction distribution that attempts to fix
the corruptions while also preserving validity. This approach constrains the
generative model to only produce valid objects, requires the learner to only

variations, and are well fitted by a quadratic ephemeris with period decay
dP/dt = -9.2 +/- 1.1 ms/yr. We rule out instrumental issues, stellar activity
and the Applegate mechanism as possible causes. The light-time effect is also
not favoured due to the non-detection of changes in the systemic velocity.
Orbital decay and apsidal precession are plausible but unproven. WASP-4b is
only the third hot Jupiter known to show transit timing variations to high

large-area-equivalent telescopes by using fiber optics to link modules of
multiple semi-autonomous, small, inexpensive, commercial-off-the-shelf
telescopes. Crucially, this scalable design has construction costs which are
$>10x$ lower than equivalent traditional large-area telescopes. In addition,
PolyOculus is inherently highly automated and well-suited for remote
operations. Development of this technology will enable the expansion of major
research efforts in the LSST era to a host of smaller universities and
colleges, including primarily-undergraduate institutions, for budgets
consistent with their educational expenditures on similar facilities. We

with diffusion of mesenchymal stem cells to the fracture callus and their

bone-remodeling phase. In this work, a mechano-regulatory cellular
differentiation model was used to simulate tissue healing around an immediately
loaded dental implant. All tissue types were modeled as poroelastic in the
healing phase. Material properties of the healing region were updated after
each loading cycle for 30 cycles (days). The tissue distribution in the healed
state was then used as the initial condition for the remodeling phase during
which regions healed into bone adapt their internal density with respect to a
homeostatic remodeling stimulus. The short- and long-term effects of
micro-motion on bone healing and remodeling were studied. Development of soft
tissue was observed both in the coronal region due to high fluid velocity, and
on the vertical sides of the healing-callus due to high shear stress. In cases
with small implant micromotion, tissue between the implant threads
differentiated into bone during the healing phase, but resorbed during
remodeling. In cases with large implant micromotion, higher percentage of the
healing region differentiated into soft tissue resulting in less volume
available for bone remodeling. But, the remaining bone region developed higher
density bone tissue. It was concluded that an optimal range of controlled
micromotion could be designed for a given implant in order to achieve the

presented; an active grid turbulence generator developed by our group was used
to seed in the elevated FST and evaluate the influence of turbulence intensity
(Ti) and inflow integral length scale (L) on the near-wake of the turbine.
Three inflow conditions are tested: a quasi-laminar flow with Ti ~ 2.2% and two
elevated Ti (~12-14%) cases, one with L ~ 0.4D (D is the turbine diameter) and
the other where L~ D. Elevated Ti cases was found to increase the standard
deviation of rotor torque by 4.5 times the value in quasi-laminar flow. Energy
recovery was also found to be accelerated; at X/D=4, the percentage of inflow
energy recovered was 37% and was twice the corresponding value in quasi-laminar
flow. Elevated FST was observed to disrupt the rotational character of the
wake; the drop in swirl number ranged between 12% at X/D=0.5 to 71% at X/D=4.
Elevated Ti also resulted in L that were considerably larger (> 2 times) than
the quasi-laminar flow case. An increase in inflow integral length scale (from
0.4D to D) was observed to result in enhanced wake Ti, wake structures and
anisotropy; however, no noticeable influence was found on the rate of wake
recovery.

compounds with various H2 compositions under different pressures that could be
as low as 0.8 GPa (KIH2). Especially, the commonly known table salt, NaCl, can

behavior of emission and absorption features in a contiguous 22 x 300 arcsec
region centered on the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 55. Based on the relative
strengths of various emission features measured over spatial scales of many
tens of parsecs, it is concluded that the ionization states and sulphur
abundances in most of the star-forming regions near the center of NGC 55 are
similar. A large star-forming region is identified in the north west part of
the disk at a projected distance of ~1 kpc from the galaxy center that has
distinct ionization properties. Fossil star-forming regions are also identified
using the depth of the near-infrared Ca triplet. One such area is identified
near the intersection of the major and minor axes, and it is suggested that
this area is a proto-nucleus. The spectra of bright unresolved sources that are
blended stellar asterisms, compact HII regions, and star clusters are also
discussed. The spectra of some of the HII regions contain Ca triplet absorption
lines, signalling a concentration of stars in the resolution element that span
many Myr. Six of the unresolved sources have spectroscopic characteristics that
are indicative of C stars embedded in intermediate age clusters. The peculiar
properties of NGC 55 have been well documented in the literature, and it is
argued that these may indicate that NGC 55 is transforming into a dwarf
lenticular galaxy.

processes such as mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, and natal kicks,
all of which are poorly understood. Also, the predicted NS-NS merger rates are
typically lower than the rates inferred from the LIGO GW170817 event. Here, we
investigate merger rates of NS and black hole (BH)-NS binaries in hierarchical
triple-star systems. In such systems, the tertiary can induce Lidov-Kozai (LK)
oscillations in the inner binary, accelerating its coalescence, and potentially
enhancing compact object merger rates. However, since compact objects originate
from massive stars, the prior evolution should also be taken into account.
Natal kicks, in particular, could significantly reduce the rates by unbinding
the tertiary before it can affect the inner binary through LK evolution. We
carry out simulations of massive triples taking into account stellar evolution
starting from the main sequence, secular and tidal evolution, and the effects
of supernovae. For large NS birth kicks (\sigma_k = 265 km/s), we find that the
triple NS-NS merger rate (several hundred Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}) is lower by a
factor of ~2-3 than the binary rate, but for no kicks (\sigma_k = 0 km/s), the
triple rate (several thousand Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}) is comparable to the binary
rate. Our results indicate that a significant fraction of NS-NS mergers could
originate from triples if a substantial portion of the NS population is born
with low kick velocities, as indicated by other work. However, uncertainties
and open questions remain because of our simplifying assumption of dynamical
decoupling after inner binary interaction has been triggered.

The objective is to minimize the maximum length among all the trees. We give
the first constant factor approximation for the hard uniform capacitated

number of vertices that can be covered by any of the trees. Our result extends

This means that if magnetic radiation memory is present, at least one of the
intervals bracketing the radiation must have non-zero magnetic shear but
vanishing radiation. Such intervals, called here CPMS regimes, are shown to be
necessarily non-stationary, however, raising a variety of technical and

red-shift effect which could be searched for astrophysically: light coming from
behind a source generating magnetic shear would be red-shifted by an amount
varying with the angle around the source of shear, and in the far-field limit
this red-shift goes inversely with the impact parameter. Induction-zone effects
are also considered. An induction-zone memory effect should exist which could

high-intensity neutrino beams for precision measurements, it is timely to
explore physics topics beyond the standard neutrino-related physics. Given that
the realm of beyond the standard model (BSM) physics has been mostly sought at
high-energy regimes at colliders, such as the LHC at CERN, the exploration of
BSM physics in neutrino experiments will enable complementary measurements at
the energy regimes that balance that of the LHC. This is in concert with new
ideas for high-intensity beams for fixed target and beam-dump experiments
world-wide, e.g., those at CERN. The combination of the high intensity proton
beam facilities and massive detectors for precision neutrino oscillation
parameter measurements and for CP violation phase measurements will help make
BSM physics reachable even in low energy regimes in accelerator based
experiments. Large mass detectors with highly precise tracking and energy
measurements, excellent timing resolution, and low energy thresholds will
enable searches for BSM phenomena from cosmogenic origin, as well. Therefore,
it is conceivable that BSM topics in the next generation neutrino experiments
could be the dominant physics topics in the foreseeable future, as the
precision of the neutrino oscillation parameter and CPV measurements continues
to improve. In this spirit, this white paper provides a review of the current
landscape of BSM theory in neutrino experiments in two selected areas of the
BSM topics - dark matter and neutrino related BSM - and summarizes the current
results from existing neutrino experiments to set benchmarks for both theory
and experiment. This paper then provides a review of upcoming neutrino
experiments throughout the next 10 - 15 year time scale and their capabilities
to set the foundation for potential reach in BSM physics in the two

pre-supernova star, can produce electromagnetic radiation as the wave
propagates outside the collapsing core. While the energy of this co-produced
electromagnetic radiation is orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational
radiation, the electromagnetic power is shown to be sufficient to re-ignite
fusion outside of the iron core. The re-ignition of fusion in the silicon layer
of the collapsing star could provide the means to prevent the supernova from
stalling. We conclude that this production of electromagnetic radiation via the
gravitational wave should be included in computer simulations which model
core-collapse supernova.

provided by an expert. Recently, an automatic abstraction procedure has been
proposed in the literature to create a Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL) representation, which is the most widely used input format for most
off-the-shelf automated planners, starting from `options', a data structure
used to represent actions within the hierarchical reinforcement learning
framework. We propose an architecture that potentially removes the need for
human intervention. In particular, the architecture first acquires options in a
fully autonomous fashion on the basis of open-ended learning, then builds a
PDDL domain based on symbols and operators that can be used to accomplish
user-defined goals through a standard PDDL planner.
  We start from an implementation of the above mentioned procedure tested on a
set of benchmark domains in which a humanoid robot can change the state of some
objects through direct interaction with the environment. We then investigate
some critical aspects of the information abstraction process that have been
observed, and propose an extension that mitigates such criticalities, in
particular by analysing the type of classifiers that allow a suitable grounding
of symbols.

rank correlation we found that the gamma-ray variability is correlated with a
particular region (feature B, in the MOJAVE images) downstream from the
observed base (core) of the jet. This jet component is, therefore, a likely
location at which an important fraction of the variable gamma-ray emission is
produced. We also calculated the average proper motion of the component with
respect to the VLBA core and found that it moves at an apparent superluminal
velocity of $(3.70 \pm 0.35)c$, implying that one of the gamma-ray emission

skewness of the probability density function (PDF) of the axial velocity

particle plume has a non-negligible fluid-shear production term in the

and the electrical behavior of this topological insulator under compression
have been discussed and compared with the parent binary alpha-Sb2Te3 and SnTe

presence of an isostructural phase transition around 2 GPa and a Fermi

modes that are forbidden in rocksalt SnTe; thus showing a novel way to
experimentally observe the forbidden vibrational modes of some compounds.
Additionally, since SnSb2Te4 is an incipient metal, like its parent binary
compounds, we establish a new criterion to identify the recently proposed
metavalent bonding in complex materials when different bond characters coexist
in the system. Finally, SnSb2Te4 exhibits a pressure-induced decomposition into
the high-pressure phases of its parent binary compounds above 7 GPa, which is
supported by an analysis of their formation enthalpies. We have framed the

optoelectronics and photonics research. While emission rate enhancement is
certainly one of the targets, in this regard, for LED integration to complex
photonic devices, one would require to have, additionally, precise control of
the wavefront of the emitted light. Metasurfaces are spatial arrangements of
engineered scatters that may enable this light manipulation capability with
unprecedented resolution. Most of these devices, however, are only able to
function properly under irradiation of light with a large spatial coherence,
typically normally incident lasers. LEDs, on the other hand, have angularly
broad, Lambertian-like emission patterns characterized by a low spatial
coherence, which makes the integration of metasurface devices on LED
architectures extremely challenging. A novel concept for metasurface
integration on LED is proposed, using a cavity to increase the LED spatial
coherence through an angular collimation. Due to the resonant character of the
cavity, extending the spatial coherence of the emitted light does not come at
the price of any reduction in the total emitted power. The experimental
demonstration of the proposed concept is implemented on a GaP LED architecture
including a hybrid metallic-Bragg cavity. By integrating a silicon metasurface
on top we demonstrate two different functionalities of these compact devices:
directional LED emission at a desired angle and LED emission of a vortex beam

single top quark and antiquark production in proton-proton collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. From a data
set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$, events
containing one muon or electron and two or three jets are analysed. The cross
section is measured as a function of the top quark transverse momentum
($p_\mathrm{T}$), rapidity, and polarisation angle, the charged lepton
$p_\mathrm{T}$ and rapidity, and the $p_\mathrm{T}$ of the W boson from the top
quark decay. In addition, the charge ratio is measured differentially as a
function of the top quark, charged lepton, and W boson kinematic observables.
The results are found to be in agreement with standard model predictions using
various next-to-leading-order event generators and sets of parton distribution
functions. Additionally, the spin asymmetry, sensitive to the top quark
polarisation, is determined from the differential distribution of the
polarisation angle at parton level to be 0.440 $\pm$ 0.070, in agreement with
the standard model prediction.

  field near the epicenter before earthquake","18 pages, 3 figures, 2 supplementary figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although earthquake prediction is a big challenge in the world, some simple
observational tools can capture many physical signals and demonstrate that an
earthquake (EQ) may be forthcoming in short period. Many researchers have
studied the significant variation of atmospheric electrostatic field related to
the forthcoming earthquake. However, until now, there is not a compelling
physical mechanism which can explain why atmospheric electrostatic abnormal
signal could appear just before an earthquake. Here we present a precursor
signal and propose a brief physical interpretation. Under fair air conditions,
if the near-surface atmospheric electrostatic field Ez (oriented down when it
is positive) presents a very stable negative anomaly (from -100 V/m to -5000
V/m), it will forebode that an earthquake (seismicity from 3-8) would take
place in the next several to tens of hours within a distance less than 100 km.
We name this prediction technique as ""DC Ez Determination""(DED). In addition,
the mechanism of such abnormal quasi-static electric field before a forthcoming
earthquake has been proposed here: (1) Radon gas releases from the rock clefts
near the epicenter during seismogenic process. (2) {\alpha} particles are
produced due to the radioactive decay of Radon gas in the air. (3) {\alpha}
particle ionizing radiation creates more positive particles in the air, which
is much more effective than that {\beta} and {\gamma} particles produced during
Radon radioactive decay. (4) The new positive particles change formal positive
atmospheric electric field (Ez) into stably negative near the earth-surface.
(5) The closer the instrument is to the epicenter, the more likely it is to
observe the negative Ez signal related to the earthquake. It is recommended to
establish an instrument network to capture the reliable precursor and make some
warnings before the earthquake disaster.

One problem with this approach is that the anomaly score of rare-normal sounds
becomes higher than that of frequent-normal sounds, because the sample mean is
strongly affected by frequent-normal samples, resulting in preferentially
decreasing the anomaly score of frequent-normal samples. To decrease anomaly
scores for both frequent- and rare-normal sounds, we propose batch
uniformization, a training method for unsupervised-ADS for minimizing a
weighted average of the anomaly score on each sample in a mini-batch. We used
the reciprocal of the probabilistic density of each sample as the weight, more
intuitively, a large weight is given for rare-normal sounds. Such a weight
works to give a constant anomaly score for both frequent- and rare-normal
sounds. Since the probabilistic density is unknown, we estimate it by using the
kernel density estimation on each training mini-batch. Verification- and
objective-experiments show that the proposed batch uniformization improves the
performance of unsupervised-ADS.

is a fundamental ability of intelligent systems. In video understanding,
temporal information is at the core of many current challenges, including
compression, efficient inference, motion estimation or summarization. However,
in current video datasets it has been observed that action classes can often be
recognized without any temporal information from a single frame of video. As a
result, both benchmarking and training in these datasets may give an
unintentional advantage to models with strong image understanding capabilities,
as opposed to those with strong temporal understanding. In this paper we
address this problem head on by identifying action classes where temporal
information is actually necessary to recognize them and call these ""temporal
classes"". Selecting temporal classes using a computational method would bias
the process. Instead, we propose a methodology based on a simple and effective
human annotation experiment. We remove just the temporal information by
shuffling frames in time and measure if the action can still be recognized.
Classes that cannot be recognized when frames are not in order are included in
the temporal Dataset. We observe that this set is statistically different from
other static classes, and that performance in it correlates with a network's
ability to capture temporal information. Thus we use it as a benchmark on
current popular networks, which reveals a series of interesting facts. We also
explore the effect of training on the temporal dataset, and observe that this
leads to better generalization in unseen classes, demonstrating the need for
more temporal data. We hope that the proposed dataset of temporal categories
will help guide future research in temporal modeling for better video
understanding.

confirm that a strong redshift evolution in luminosity (with an evolution index
of $\delta=2.22^{+0.32}_{-0.31}$) or in density ($\delta=1.92^{+0.20}_{-0.21}$)
is needed in order to reproduce the observations well. But since the predicted
redshift and luminosity distributions in the two scenarios are very similar, it
is difficult to distinguish between these two kinds of evolutions only on the
basis of the current sample. Furthermore, we also consider an empirical density
case in which the GRB rate density is directly described as a broken power-law
function and the luminosity function is taken to be non-evolving. In this case,
we find that the GRB formation rate rises like $(1+z)^{3.85^{+0.48}_{-0.45}}$
for $z\leq2$ and is proportional to $(1+z)^{-1.07^{+0.98}_{-1.12}}$ for
$z\geq2$. The local GRB rate is $1.49^{+0.63}_{-0.64}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$.
The GRB rate may be consistent with the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) at

process (GP) that is modeled as a linear mixing of independent latent GPs.
Sharing of latent GPs across multiple areal data sets allows us to effectively
estimate the spatial correlation for each areal data set; moreover it can
easily be extended to transfer learning across multiple domains. To handle the
multivariate areal data, we design an observation model with a spatial
aggregation process for each areal data set, which is an integral of the mixed
GP over the corresponding region. By deriving the posterior GP, we can predict
the data value at any location point by considering the spatial correlations
and the dependences between areal data sets, simultaneously. Our experiments on
real-world data sets demonstrate that our model can 1) accurately refine
coarse-grained areal data, and 2) offer performance improvements by using the
areal data sets from multiple domains.

bottleneck of AI planning technique application in many real-world scenarios.
Most classical domain-model learning approaches output a domain model in the
form of the declarative planning language, such as STRIPS or PDDL, and solve
new planning instances by invoking an existing planner. However, planning in
such a representation is sensitive to the accuracy of the learned domain model
which probably cannot be used to solve real planning problems. In this paper,
to represent domain models in a vectorization representation way, we propose a
novel framework based on graph neural network (GNN) integrating model-free
learning and model-based planning, called LP-GNN. By embedding propositions and
actions in a graph, the latent relationship between them is explored to form a
domain-specific heuristics. We evaluate our approach on five classical planning
domains, comparing with the classical domain-model learner ARMS. The
experimental results show that the domain models learned by our approach are
much more effective on solving real planning problems.

cryptography against preprocessing attacks. Our results span data structure
upper bounds, cryptographic applications, and data structure lower bounds, as
summarized next.
  First, we apply Fiat--Naor inversion, a technique with cryptographic origins,
to obtain a data structure upper bound. In particular, our technique yields a
suite of algorithms with space $S$ and (online) time $T$ for a preprocessing
version of the $N$-input 3SUM problem where $S^3\cdot T = \widetilde{O}(N^6)$.
This disproves a strong conjecture (Goldstein et al., WADS 2017) that there is
no data structure that solves this problem for $S=N^{2-\delta}$ and $T =
N^{1-\delta}$ for any constant $\delta>0$.
  Secondly, we show equivalence between lower bounds for a broad class of
(static) data structure problems and one-way functions in the random oracle
model that resist a very strong form of preprocessing attack. Concretely, given
a random function $F: [N] \to [N]$ (accessed as an oracle) we show how to
compile it into a function $G^F: [N^2] \to [N^2]$ which resists $S$-bit
preprocessing attacks that run in query time $T$ where
$ST=O(N^{2-\varepsilon})$ (assuming a corresponding data structure lower bound
on 3SUM). In contrast, a classical result of Hellman tells us that $F$ itself
can be more easily inverted, say with $N^{2/3}$-bit preprocessing in $N^{2/3}$
time. We also show that much stronger lower bounds follow from the hardness of
kSUM. Our results can be equivalently interpreted as security against
adversaries that are very non-uniform, or have large auxiliary input, or as
security in the face of a powerfully backdoored random oracle.
  Thirdly, we give non-adaptive lower bounds for 3SUM and a range of geometric
problems which match the best known lower bounds for static data structure
problems.

query access to a vector $\vx \in \R^N$ such that $\vhx = \vF \vx$ is
$k$-sparse (or nearly $k$-sparse) for some orthogonal transform $\vF$. The goal
is to output an approximation (in an $\ell_2$ sense) to $\vhx$ in sublinear
time. This problem has been well-studied in the special case that $\vF$ is the
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and a long line of work has resulted in
sparse Fast Fourier Transforms that run in time $O(k \cdot \mathrm{polylog}
N)$. However, for transforms $\vF$ other than the DFT (or closely related
transforms like the Discrete Cosine Transform), the question is much less
settled.
  In this paper we give sublinear-time algorithms---running in time $\poly(k
\log(N))$---for solving the sparse recovery problem for orthogonal transforms
$\vF$ that arise from orthogonal polynomials. More precisely, our algorithm
works for any $\vF$ that is an orthogonal polynomial transform derived from
Jacobi polynomials. The Jacobi polynomials are a large class of classical
orthogonal polynomials (and include Chebyshev and Legendre polynomials as
special cases), and show up extensively in applications like numerical analysis
and signal processing. One caveat of our work is that we require an assumption
on the sparsity structure of the sparse vector, although we note that vectors
with random support have this property with high probability.
  Our approach is to give a very general reduction from the $k$-sparse sparse
recovery problem to the $1$-sparse sparse recovery problem that holds for any
flat orthogonal polynomial transform; then we solve this one-sparse recovery
problem for transforms derived from Jacobi polynomials.

extensive UAV game theoretical models show limitations in post-disaster

highly dynamic post-disaster scenarios cause strategies updating constraint and

employ aggregative game which could capture and cover those characteristics.
Moreover, we propose a novel synchronous payoff-based binary log-linear

in a one-dimensional lattice is investigated, with an emphasis placed on its
usefulness in revealing many-body interaction effects on interband coherence.
For a non-interacting system, the pumped charge per adiabatic cycle depends not
only on the topology of the occupied bands but also on the interband coherence
in the initial state. This insight leads to an interesting opportunity for
quantitatively observing how quantum coherence is affected by many-body
interaction that is switched on for a varying duration prior to adiabatic
pumping. In particular, interband coherence effects can be clearly observed by
adjusting the switch-on rates with different adiabatic pumping protocols and by
scanning the duration of many-body interaction prior to adiabatic pumping. The
time dependence of single-particle interband coherence in the presence of
many-body interaction can then be examined in detail. As a side but interesting
result, for relatively weak interaction strength, it is found that the
difference in the pumped charges between different pumping protocols vanishes
if a coherence measure defined from the single-particle density matrix in the
sublattice representation reaches its local minima. Our results hence provide
an interesting means to quantitatively probe the dynamics of quantum coherence
in the presence of many-body interaction (e.g., in a thermalization process).

of assets. The model is a nonlinear and non-Gaussian state space model, and
consequently is difficult to fit. Many approaches, both classical and Bayesian,
have been developed that rely on numerically intensive techniques such as
quasi-maximum likelihood estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
Convergence and mixing problems still plague MCMC algorithms when drawing
samples sequentially from the posterior distributions. While particle Gibbs
methods have been successful when applied to nonlinear or non-Gaussian state
space models in general, slow convergence still haunts the technique when
applied specifically to stochastic volatility models. We present an approach
that couples particle Gibbs with ancestral sampling and joint parameter
sampling that ameliorates the slow convergence and mixing problems when fitting
both univariate and multivariate stochastic volatility models. We demonstrate
the enhanced method on various numerical examples.

not exhibit any magnetic (spin-dipole) order but has a spin-quadrupolar
long-range order. Employing a perturbation calculation, a mean-field

determine ground-state phase diagrams on various two-dimensional lattices. It
is found that the model exhibits the spin nematic phase with ferro-quadrupolar
order in a wide parameter region, in addition to conventional
magnetically-ordered phases. In particular, it is shown that even when the
four-spin interactions are absent, frustrated two-spin exchange interactions
can realize the spin nematic phase as a result of strong interdimer
correlations. It is also found that the phase transitions between the spin
nematic phase and antiferromagnetic phases can be continuous. Furthermore, we
present some exact arguments that various phases including the spin nematic
phase and the vector chiral (p-type nematic) phase emerge from an SU(4)
symmetric point in the model by the addition of appropriate perturbative
interactions. The spin nematic phase generated from the SU(4) point is
connected with the spin nematic phase found numerically in the system with only

leads to a linear potential through a time dependent refractive index change
which is experienced by the finite energy Airy pulse (FEAP) (probe). The linear
potential significantly manipulate the dynamics of a FEAP and leads to a
monotonous spectral shift. We mathematically model the dynamics of the Airy
pulse using linear dispersion equation containing an optical potential term and
establish the general solution of the pulse for non-vanishing third order

deviates significantly from its usual ballistic nature and can be tailored with
the strength of the linear potential. For positive TOD, the propagating Airy
pulse experiences a singularity and flips in time domain. We theoretically
derive that for a specific potential strength the flipping region is squeezed

only handle unsupervised closed set domain adaptation (UCSDA), i.e., where the
source and target domains are assumed to share the same label set. In this
paper, we target a more challenging but realistic setting: unsupervised open
set domain adaptation (UOSDA), where the target domain has unknown classes that

learning bound for open set domain adaptation, which we do by theoretically
investigating the risk of the target classifier on unknown classes. The
proposed learning bound has a special term, namely open set difference, which
reflects the risk of the target classifier on unknown classes. Further, we
present a novel and theoretically guided unsupervised algorithm for open set
domain adaptation, called distribution alignment with ppen difference (DAOD),

the accuracy improvement. The system maintains an append-only decentralized
ledger to keep the log of critical information, including who has trained the
model and improved its accuracy, when it has been improved, by how much it has
improved, and where to find the newly updated model. DaiMoN rewards these
contributing peers with cryptographic tokens. A main feature of DaiMoN is that
it allows peers to verify the accuracy improvement of submitted models without
knowing the test labels. This is an essential component in order to mitigate
intentional model overfitting by model-improving peers. To enable this model
accuracy evaluation with hidden test labels, DaiMoN uses a novel learnable
Distance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function proposed in this paper. Specific
to each test dataset, DEL scrambles the test label vector by embedding it in a
low-dimension space while approximately preserving the distance between the
dataset's test label vector and a label vector inferred by the classifier. It
therefore allows proof-of-improvement (PoI) by peers without providing them
access to true test labels. We provide analysis and empirical evidence that
under DEL, peers can accurately assess model accuracy. We also argue that it is
hard to invert the embedding function and thus, DEL is resilient against
attacks aiming to recover test labels in order to cheat. Our prototype

enhancing CEU capacity. Imperfect SIC and imperfect CSI may degrade capacity.
The proposed system can maintain CEU capacity better than the other schemes if

Specifically, electron holography analyses reveal the spin configurations of
N\'eel-type, zero-field-stabilized skyrmions in 20-nm-thick Fe3GeTe2 nanoflakes
at cryogenic temperature. In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy
measurements further provide detailed magnetic phase diagrams of chiral spin

calculations unveil a finite interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in
the Te/Fe3Ge/Te slabs that induces the spin chirality in Fe3GeTe2. Our
discovery of spin chirality in the prototypical vdW Fe3GeTe2 opens up new
opportunities for studying chiral magnetism in two-dimensional vdW magnets from

athermal colloidal suspensions under cyclic shear deformation is an archetypal
nonequilibrium phase transition which attracts much attention recently. In the
low-density limit, the RI transition is predicted to belong to a universality
class of the absorbing state transitions, whereas at the high densities well
above the jamming transition density, $\varphi_{\rm J}$, the transition is
discontinuous and is closely related to the yielding transition. The transition
between the two limiting cases is largely unexplored. In this paper, we study
the RI transition of athermal frictionless colloidal particles over a wide
range of densities, with emphasis on the region below $\varphi_{\rm J}$, by
using oscillatory sheared molecular dynamics simulation. We reveal that the
nature of the RI transitions in the intermediate densities is very rich. As
demonstrated by the previous work by Schreck $et\ al.$ [Phys. Rev. E. ${\bf
88}$, 052205 (2013)], there exist the point-reversible and the loop-reversible
phases depending on the density and the shear strain amplitude. We find that,
between the two reversible phases, a quasi-irreversible phase where the
particles' trajectories are highly non-affine and diffusive. The averaged
number of contacts of particles is found to characterize the phase boundaries.
We also find that the system undergoes the yielding transition below but in the
vicinity of $\varphi_{\rm J}$ when the strain with a small but finite strain
rate is applied. This yielding transition line matches with the RI transition
line separating the loop-reversible from the irreversible phases. Surprisingly,
the nonlinear rheological response called ""softening"" has been observed even
below $\varphi_{\rm J}$. These findings imply that geometrical properties
encoded in the sheared configurations control the dynamical transitions.

in semiconductor and molecular systems. Here we discuss the spin manipulation
allowed by the modulation of the main parameters entering the Hamiltonians of
molecular spin clusters. In particular, we focus on transitions between states
that differ in terms of scalar quantities, such as the total- or the
partial-spin sums, but have vanishing expectation values of both the total- and
the single-spin projections. These conditions supposedly define subspaces that
are immune to the main decoherence mechanisms and that cannot be identified in
individual spins, where the total- and the partial-spin sums are fixed or
cannot be defined. We show that the desired transitions can in principle be
realized in systems as simple as a spin dimer, by modulating the g-factor, the
axial anisotropy, or, under suitable conditions, the exchange interaction.

unidirectional crystallization of ice to structure macroporous materials from

employ it here to cast soft self-assembled matter into spongy solid foams. Use
of ice-templating to cast soft matter is generally confined to polymers. In the
case of polymeric hydrogels, cross-linking ensures a good stability towards the
harsh conditions (fast cooling at temperatures as low as-80{\textdegree}C)
employed during ice-templating. However, freeze-casting of soft systems held
together by weak interactions, like in physical gels, has not been explored,
because the nonequilibrium conditions could easily disrupt the nano and
macroscale organization of self-assembled matter, resulting in a cruel loss of
mechanical properties. Whether this is a general assumption or a more specific
relationship exists between the structure of the physical gel and the
properties of the macroporous solid after ice-templating is the question
addressed in this work. We compare two self-assembled lipid hydrogels, of
analogous chemical composition and comparable elastic properties under ambient
conditions, but different structure: isotropic entangled self-assembled fibers
against heterogeneous lipid lamellar phase. Our results show that both
materials possess the same phase (fibrillar and lamellar) before 2 and after
freeze-casting but the mechanical properties are absolutely at the opposite:
the fibrillar hydrogel provides a brittle, highly anisotropic, macroporous
fibrous solid while the lamellar hydrogel provides soft, spongy, solid foam
with isotropic Young moduli of several kPa, in the same order of magnitude as
some soft living tissues.

most challenging problems in the physics of strong interactions. The various
single hadron and dihadron fragmentation functions, that quantify this process,
are determined by analyzing the inclusive production of hadrons in
electron-positron semi-inclusive annihilation process (SIA). These, in turn,
are used to extract the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution
functions from the experiments on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering
process (SIDIS), elucidating the spin-orbit correlations in nucleon.
  Here we present a framework for new measurements of polarized quark
fragmentation functions in electron-positron annihilation and deep inelastic
semi-inclusive processes. These measurements offer a number of exciting
opportunities to improve our understanding of the polarized quark hadronization
and test the universality of the fragmentation functions. Such measurements can
be performed at the upcoming BELLE II, JLab-12 and the future EIC experiments

mining industry. As the equipment becomes connected and technical
infrastructure evolves, business models and risk management need to adapt. In
this paper, we present a study on how changes in asset and risk distribution
are evolving for the actors in a software ecosystem (SECO) and
system-of-systems (SoS) around a mining operation. We have performed a survey
to understand how Service Level Agreements (SLAs) -- a common mechanism for
managing risk -- are used in other domains. Furthermore, we have performed a
focus group study with companies. There is an overall trend in the mining
industry to move the investment cost (CAPEX) from the mining operator to the
vendors. Hence, the mining operator instead leases the equipment (as
operational expense, OPEX) or even acquires a service. This change in business
model impacts operation, as knowledge is moved from the mining operator to the
suppliers. Furthermore, as the infrastructure becomes more complex, this
implies that the mining operator is more and more reliant on the suppliers for
the operation and maintenance. As this change is still in an early stage, there
is no formalized risk management, e.g. through SLAs, in place. Rather, at
present, the companies in the ecosystem rely more on trust and the incentives
created by the promise of mutual future benefits of innovation activities. We
believe there is a need to better understand how to manage risk in SECO as it
is established and evolves. At the same time, in a SECO, the focus is on
cooperation and innovation, the companies do not have incentives to address
this unless there is an incident. Therefore, industry need, we believe, help in
systematically understanding risk and defining quality aspects such as
reliability and performance in the new business environment.

large-scale problem sizes, we adopt a very simple guiding principle: One should
prefer main effects over interactions if all else is equal. This ""reluctance""

is much less restrictive. We design a computationally efficient method built
upon this principle and provide theoretical results indicating favorable
statistical properties. Empirical results show dramatic computational
improvement without sacrificing statistical properties. For example, the

effects through multiple mediators requires strict assumptions, such as
correctly postulating the causal structure of the mediators, and no unmeasured
confounding among the mediators. In contrast, interventional indirect effects
for multiple mediators can be identified even when - as often - the mediators
either have an unknown causal structure, or share unmeasured common causes, or
both. Existing estimation methods for interventional indirect effects require
calculating each distinct indirect effect in turn. This can quickly become
unwieldy or unfeasible, especially when investigating indirect effect measures
that may be modified by observed baseline characteristics. In this article, we
introduce simplified estimation procedures for such heterogeneous
interventional indirect effects using interventional effect models.
Interventional effect models are a class of marginal structural models that
encode the interventional indirect effects as causal model parameters, thus
readily permitting effect modification by baseline covariates using
(statistical) interaction terms. The mediators and outcome can be continuous or
noncontinuous. We propose two estimation procedures: one using inverse
weighting by the counterfactual mediator density or mass functions, and another
using Monte Carlo integration. The former has the advantage of not requiring an
outcome model, but is susceptible to finite sample biases due to highly
variable weights. The latter has the advantage of consistent estimation under a
correctly specified (parametric) outcome model, but is susceptible to biases
due to extrapolation.

introduced. It models the interdependencies between spatial features and then
aggregates the correlated features corresponding to the same body parts. Unlike
CNNs which extract features from fixed rectangle regions, SIA can adaptively
determine the receptive fields according to the input person pose and scale.
Secondly, we introduce Channel IA (CIA) module which selectively aggregates
channel features to enhance the feature representation, especially for

However, dynamical encirclement around multiple second-order EPs in a

of a planar gain-loss assisted three-mode supported optical waveguide with
local Kerr-nonlinearity, we encounter multiple second-order EPs. Judiciously,
choosing a specific parameter space by varying the unbalanced gain-loss

toward corresponding chiral or non-chiral aspects of the device. While
propagating through the designed waveguide, three coupled modes are collapsed
into a specific dominating mode, owing to corresponding nonadiabatic

same amount of focusing and de-focusing type nonlinearity gives different
dominating output, irrespective of the choice of inputs, for the same

tool to study the properties and mechanisms of biological systems, such as

used to extract the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding and unfolding
reactions. In hopping experiments, a molecule executes transitions between the
unfolded and folded states at a preset value of the force (constant force mode
-CFM- under force feedback) or trap position (passive mode -PM- without
feedback) and the force-dependent kinetic rates extracted from the lifetime of
each state (CFM) and the rupture force distributions (PM) using the Bell-Evans
model. However, hopping experiments in the CFM are known to overestimate
molecular distances and folding free energies for fast transitions compared to
the response time of the feedback. In contrast, kinetic rate measurements from
pulling experiments have been mostly done in the PM while the CFM is seldom
implemented in pulling protocols. Here, we carry out hopping and pulling
experiments in a short DNA hairpin in the PM and CFM at three different
temperatures (6$^\circ$C, 25$^\circ$C and 45$^\circ$C) exhibiting largely
varying kinetic rates. As expected, we find that equilibrium hopping
experiments in the CFM and PM perform well at 6$^\circ$C (where kinetics is
slow) whereas the CFM overestimates molecular parameters at 45$^\circ$C (where
kinetics is fast). In contrast, nonequilibrium pulling experiments perform well
in both modes at all temperatures. This demonstrates that the same kind of
feedback algorithm in the CFM leads to more reliable determination of the
folding reaction parameters in irreversible pulling experiments.

filamentary structure seen around the clump repeats itself on a smaller scale,
and to estimate the fractions of mass contained in dense cores and filaments.
The velocity distribution of pristine dense gas can be used to investigate the
global dynamical state of the clump, the role of filamentary inflows, filament
fragmentation and core accretion. We use molecular line and continuum
observations from single dish observatories and interferometric facilities to
study the kinematics of the region. The molecular line observations show that
the central clump may have formed as a result of a large-scale filament
collision. The central clump contains three compact cores. Assuming a distance
of 2.3 kpc, based on Gaia observations and a three-dimensional extinction
method of background stars, the mass of the central clump exceeds 700 solar
masses, which is roughly 25% of the total mass of the cloud. Our virial
analysis suggests that the central clump and all identified substructures are

holographic complexity (HC) after a thermal quench in $1+1$ dimensional
boundary CFTs dual to massive BTZ black holes. The study indicates how the
graviton mass $m_g$, the charge $q$, and also the size of the boundary region
$l$ determine the evolution of the HEE and HC. We find that for small $q$ and
$l$, the evolutions of the HEE and the HC is a continuous function. When $q$ or
$l$ is tuned larger, the discontinuity emerges, which could not observed in the
neutral AdS$_3$ backgrounds. We show that, the emergence of this discontinuity
is a universal behavior in the charged massive BTZ theory. With the increase of
graviton mass, on the other hand, no emergence of the discontinuity behavior
for any small $q$ and $l$ could be observed. We also show that the evolution of
the HEE and HC both become stable at later times, and $m_g$ speeds up reaching
to the stability during the evolution of the system. Moreover, we show that
$m_g$ decreases the final stable value of HEE but raises the stable value of
HC. Additionally, contrary to the usual picture in the literature that the
evolution of HC has only one peak, for big enough widths, we show that graviton
mass could introduce two peaks during the evolution. However, for large enough
charges the one peak behavior will be recovered again. We also examine the
evolutions of HEE and HC growths at the early stage, which an almost linear
behavior has been detected.

of several different hydrological benchmark models. Our proposed approach not
only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated
regionally but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that
were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an
adaption to the standard LSTM architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-LSTM

learning model, catchment similarities. We show that this learned catchment
similarity corresponds well with what we would expect from prior hydrological

decoded by all users, while the private part is decoded only by the intended

alphabet for multi-user multi-antenna system and propose a constructive
interference (CI) exploitation approach to further enhance the sum-rate
achieved by RS under PSK signaling. To that end, new analytical expressions for
the ergodic sum-rate are derived for two precoding techniques of the private
messages, namely, 1) a traditional interference suppression zero-forcing (ZF)
precoding approach, 2) a closed-form CI precoding approach. Our analysis is
presented for perfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), and
is extended to imperfect CSIT knowledge. A novel power allocation strategy,
specifically suited for the finite alphabet setup, is derived and shown to lead
to superior performance for RS over conventional linear precoding not relying

outside of ice lines. The presence of microscopic silicate particles may
nevertheless hinder growth into large pebbles, since the available vapour is
deposited predominantly on the small grains that dominate the total surface
area. Experiments on heterogeneous ice nucleation, performed to understand ice
clouds in the Martian atmosphere, show that the formation of a new ice layer on
a silicate surface requires a substantially higher water vapour pressure than
the deposition of water vapour on an existing ice surface. In this paper, we
investigate how the difference in partial vapour pressure needed for deposition
of vapour on water ice versus heterogeneous ice nucleation on silicate grains
influences particle growth close to the water ice line. We developed and tested
a dynamical 1D deposition and sublimation model, where we include radial drift,
sedimentation, and diffusion in a turbulent protoplanetary disc. We find that
vapour is deposited predominantly on already ice-covered particles, since the
vapour pressure exterior of the ice line is too low for heterogeneous
nucleation on bare silicate grains. Icy particles can thus grow to
centimetre-sized pebbles in a narrow region around the ice line, whereas
silicate particles stay dust-sized and diffuse out over the disc. The
inhibition of heterogeneous ice nucleation results in a preferential region for
growth into planetesimals close to the ice line where we find large icy
pebbles. The suppression of heterogeneous ice nucleation on silicate grains may
also be the mechanism behind some of the observed dark rings around ice lines
in protoplanetary discs, as the presence of large ice pebbles outside ice lines
leads to a decrease in the opacity there.

theory for this regime exists, accurate data for the density response of
correlated electrons to an external perturbation are of paramount importance.
In this context, the key quantity is given by the local field correction (LFC),
which provides a wave-vector resolved description of exchange-correlation
effects. In this work, we present extensive new path integral Monte Carlo
(PIMC) results for the static LFC of the uniform electron gas, which are
subsequently used to train a fully connected deep neural network. This allows
us to present a continuous representation of the LFC with respect to
wave-vector, density, and temperature covering the entire warm dense matter

we present a spatially explicit model that predicts the spatial distribution of
visits by Apis mellifera to crops, by simulating daily trips of honey bees, the
demographical dynamic of each hive and their honey production. This model goes
beyond existing approaches by including 1) a flower resource affected by the

particular, via impurity-ion collisions. To lowest order in an expansion in the
main ion mass over the impurity mass, the impurity-ion collision operator only
depends on the component of the main ion distribution that is odd in the
parallel velocity. These lowest order terms give the parallel friction of the
impurities with the main ions, which is typically assumed to be the main cause
of collisional impurity transport. Next-order terms in the mass ratio expansion
of the impurity-ion collision operator, proportional to the component of the
main ion distribution that is even in the parallel velocity, are usually
neglected. However, in stellarators, the even component of the main ion
distribution can be very large. In this article, such next-order terms in the
mass ratio expansion of the impurity-ion collision operator are retained, and
analytical expressions for the neoclassical radial flux of trace impurities are
calculated in the Pfirsch-Schl\""uter, plateau and $1/\nu$ regimes. The new
terms provide a drive for impurity transport that is physically very different
from parallel friction: they are associated to anisotropy in the pressure of
the main ions, which translates into impurity pressure anisotropy. It is argued
that main ion pressure anisotropy must be taken into account for a correct
description of impurity transport in certain realistic stellarator plasmas.
Examples are given by numerically evaluating the analytical expressions for the
impurity flux.

L(Lya)=(6.4+/-0.1)x10^44 erg s^-1. HLock01-LAB presents an elongated morphology
aligned with two faint radio sources contained within the central ~8kpc of the
nebula. The radio structures are consistent to be faint radio jets or lobes of
a central galaxy, whose spectrum shows nebular emission characteristic of a
type-II active galactic nucleus (AGN). The continuum emission of the AGN at
short wavelengths is, however, likely dominated by stellar emission of the host
galaxy, for which we derive a stellar mass M* = 2.3x10^11 Msun. The detection
of extended emission in CIV and CIII] indicates that the gas within the nebula
is not primordial. Feedback may have enriched the halo at at least 50 kpc from
the nuclear region. Using rest-frame UV emission-line diagnostics, we find that
the gas in the nebula is likely heated by the AGN. Nevertheless, at the center
of the nebula we find extreme emission line ratios of Lya/CIV~60 and
Lya/HeII~80, one of the highest values measured to date, and well above the
standard values of photoionization models (Lya/HeII~30 for case B
photoionization). Our data suggest that jet-induced shocks are likely
responsible for the increase of the electron temperature and, thus, the
observed Lya enhancement in the center of the nebula. This scenario is further
supported by the presence of radio structures and perturbed kinematics in this
region. The large Lya luminosity in HLock01-LAB is likely due to a combination
of AGN photoionization and jet-induced shocks, highlighting the diversity of
sources of energy powering Lya nebulae. [abridged]

dramatically when the wireless network size becomes large. In this paper, we
propose to utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to develop scalable methods for

Specifically, a $K$-user interference channel is first modeled as a complete

convolutional neural network (IGCNet) to learn the optimal power control in an
unsupervised manner. It is shown that one-layer IGCNet is a universal
approximator to continuous set functions, which well matches the permutation
invariance property of interference channels and it is robust to imperfect
channel state information (CSI). Extensive simulations will show that the
proposed IGCNet outperforms existing methods and achieves significant speedup

it is difficult to utilize useful context information in the search procedure.
To address these issues, we propose using neural networks to automatically
learn the cost functions of a classic heuristic algorithm, namely A* algorithm,
for the PRR task. Our model consists of two components. First, we employ
attention-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to model the cost from the
source to the candidate location by incorporating useful context information.
Instead of learning a single cost value, the RNN component is able to learn a
time-varying vectorized representation for the moving state of a user. Second,
we propose to use a value network for estimating the cost from a candidate
location to the destination. For capturing structural characteristics, the
value network is built on top of improved graph attention networks by
incorporating the moving state of a user and other context information. The two
components are integrated in a principled way for deriving a more accurate cost
of a candidate location. Extensive experiment results on three real-world
datasets have shown the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model.

trigger these scenarios, and finally provide the input data that satisfy these
conditions. Given that requirements specifications are typically large and
often provided in natural language, the generation of acceptance test cases
tends to be expensive and error-prone.
  In this paper, we present UMTG, an approach that supports the generation of

it does not impose strong restrictions on the expressiveness of use case

capture conditions triggering the execution of the scenarios, thus enabling the

element to one data point for the function value and one for the derivative.
The basis is extended to higher orders with nodal contributions derived from
roots of Jacobi polynomials and extended to multiple dimensions with tensor
products, which enable the use of sum factorization. The beneficial effect of
the reduced data access on modern processors is shown. Furthermore, the
viability of the basis in the context of multigrid solvers is analyzed. While a
plain point-Jacobi approach is less efficient than with the best nodal
polynomials, a basis change via sum-factorization techniques enables the
combination of the fast matrix-vector products with effective multigrid
constituents. The basis change is essentially for free on modern hardware
because these computations can be hidden behind the cost of the data access.

analyzed the probability of dynamic obstacles blocking a link in 3D Euclidean

temperature anisotropy with respect to the interplanetary magnetic field

excessive growth of the anisotropy of particle velocity distribution functions.
Among them, the firehose instabilities are often considered to prevent the
increase of the parallel temperature and hence to shape the velocity
distribution functions of electrons and protons in the solar wind. We present a
non-linear modeling of the parallel firehose instability, retaining a kinetic
description for both the electrons and protons. One-dimensional (1D) fully
kinetic Particle-In-Cell simulations using the Energy Conserving semi-implicit
method (ECsim) are performed to clarify the role of the electron temperature
anisotropy in the development of the parallel proton firehose instability. We
found that in the presence of an electron temperature anisotropy, such that the
temperature parallel to the background magnetic field is higher than the
temperature in the perpendicular direction, the onset of the parallel proton
firehose instability occurs earlier and its growth rate is faster. The enhanced
wave fluctuations contribute to the particle scattering reducing the
temperature anisotropy to a stable, nearly isotropic state. The simulation
results compare well with linear theory. A test case of 1D simulations at
oblique angles with respect to the magnetic field is also considered, as a
first step to study the cumulative effect of protons and electrons on the full
spectrum of instabilities.

of interacting particle assemblies driven by externally imposed stresses or
deformation is of interest in comprehending diverse phenomena in soft matter.
They have been investigated in a wide range of systems, such as colloidal
suspensions, glasses, and granular matter. In different density and driving
regimes, such behaviour is related to yielding of amorphous solids, jamming,
and memory formation, \emph{etc.} How these phenomena are related to each other
has not, however, been much studied. In order to obtain a unified view of the
different regimes of behaviour, and transitions between them, we investigate
computationally the response of soft sphere assemblies to athermal cyclic shear
deformation over a wide range of densities and amplitudes of shear deformation.
Cyclic shear deformation induces transitions from reversible to irreversible
behaviour in both unjammed and jammed soft sphere packings. Well above
isotropic jamming density ($\bf{\phi_J}$), this transition corresponds to
yielding. In the vicinity of the jamming point, up to a higher density limit we
designate ${\bf \phi_J^{cyc}}$, an unjammed phase emerges between a localised,
\emph{absorbing} phase, and a diffusive, {\emph irreversible} phase. The
emergence of the unjammed phase signals the shifting of the jamming point to
higher densities as a result of annealing, and opens a window where shear
jamming becomes possible for frictionless packings. Below $\bf{\phi_J}$, two
distinct localised states, termed point and loop reversibile, are observed. We
characterise in detail the different regimes and transitions between them, and
obtain a unified density-shear amplitude phase diagram.

Evidence for optical and UV spectral features has been reported in TDE flares;
nevertheless, to test the effects of General Relativity in the immediate

tell us significantly more useful information. This will require to proceed

are formulated according to Displacement Based (DB) or Force Based (FB)

of displacement shape functions. Despite the greater simplicity of DB over FB
approaches, the latter provide more accurate responses requiring a coarser
mesh. To fill the existent gap between the two approaches the improvement of
the DB formulation without the introduction of mesh refinement is needed. To
this aim the authors recently provided a contribution to the improvement of the
DB approach by proposing new enriched adaptive displacement shape functions
leading to the Smart Displacement Based (SDB) beam element. In this paper the
SDB element is extended to include the axial force-bending moment interaction,
crucial for the analysis of r/c cross sections. The proposed extension requires
the formulation of discontinuous axial displacement shape functions dependent
on the diffusion of plastic deformations. The stiffness matrix of the extended
smart element is provided explicitly and shown to be dependent on the
displacement shape functions updating. The axial force-bending moment
interaction is approached by means of a fibre discretisation of the r/c cross
section. The extended element, addressed as Fibre Smart Displacement Based
(FSDB) beam element, is shown to be accurate and furthermore accompanied by the
proposal of an optional procedure to verify strong equilibrium of the axial
force along the beam element, which is usually not accomplished by DB beam
elements. Given a fixed mesh discretisation the performance of the FSDB beam
element is compared with the DB approach to show the better accuracy of the
proposed element.

the corresponding mixture coefficients for each pixel of an image. As the
elementary spectra correspond to the reflectance spectra of real materials,
they are often very correlated yielding an ill-conditioned problem. To enrich
the model and to reduce ambiguity due to the high correlation, it is common to
introduce spatial information to complement the spectral information. The most
common way to introduce spatial information is to rely on a spatial
regularization of the abundance maps. In this paper, instead of considering a
simple but limited regularization process, spatial information is directly
incorporated through the newly proposed context of spatial unmixing. Contextual
features are extracted for each pixel and this additional set of observations
is decomposed according to a linear model. Finally the spatial and spectral
observations are unmixed jointly through a cofactorization model. In

[Theor. Probab. Appl. {\bf 10}, 15 (1965)], the calculation of the generating
function is reduced to finding the largest eigenvalue of a certain transfer
operator associated with a family of representations of the group. The
formalism is illustrated by considering products of random matrices from the

concreteness, I study in detail transfer matrix products for the

$\ln|\psi(x)|$, where $\psi(x)$ is the wavefunction, in terms of a single
integral involving the Fourier transform of the invariant density of the matrix

solved exactly.

physics. The central quantity of the classical theory is Hamilton's function,

The same structure is defined for arbitrary observables. Thus we have all of
the above entities generated not only by Hamilton's function but by every
observable. (2) We introduce for each observable a phase space function
representing the classical action. This is a redundant quantity in a classical
context but indispensable for the transition to QT. The basic equations of the
resulting theory take a ""quantum-like"" form, which allows for a simple
derivation of QT by means of a projection to configuration space reported
previously [Quantum Stud.:Math. Found. (2018) 5:219-227]. We obtain the most
important relations of QT, namely the form of operators, Schr\""odinger's

device is affected only by an invertible classical noise, it is possible to
correct the outcome statistics of future experiments performed on the same

high-precision measurements of inertia, gravity and rotation. In order to
achieve these very high sensitivities, the interrogation time has to be very
long and consequently the experimental apparatus has to be very tall, in some
cases reaching ten or even one hundred meters. Cancelling gravitational
acceleration, e.g. in atomtronic circuits6,7 and matterwave guides, will result
in compact devices having much extended interrogation times and thus much
increased sensitivity both for fundamental and practical measurements. In this
letter, we demonstrate extremely smooth and controllable matterwave guides by
transporting Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) over macroscopic distances: We use
a novel neutral-atom accelerator ring to bring BECs to very high speeds (16x
their velocity of sound) and transport them in a magnetic matterwave guide for
15 cm whilst fully preserving their internal coherence. The high angular
momentum of more than 40000h per atom gives access to the higher Landau levels
of quantum Hall states. The hypersonic velocities combined with our ability to
control the potentials with pico-Kelvin precision open new perspectives in the
study of superfluidity and give rise to new regimes of tunnelling and
transport. Coherent matterwave guides are expected to enable interaction times
of several seconds in highly compact devices. These developments will result in
portable guided-atom interferometers for applications such as inertial

unitary evolution of a closed quantum system. Within this approach, a part of
the system becomes informationally isolated (restricted) which leads to a
natural emergence of the classical domain. This measurement scenario is a
simpler alternative to environment-induced decoherence. In its basic version,
MMS involves two ancilla qubits, $A$ and $X$, entangled with each other and
with the System $S$. Informational or thermodynamic cost of measurement is
represented by $X$-qubit being isolated, i.e. becoming unavailable for future
interactions with the rest of the system. Conditional upon this isolation,
$A$-qubit, that plays the role of an Apparatus, becomes classical and records
the outcome of the measurement. The procedure may be used to perform von
Neumann-style projective measurements or generalized ones, that corresponds to
Positive-Operator Value Measure (POVM). By repeating the same generalized
measurement multiple times with different $A$- and $X$-qubits, one
asymptotically approaches the wave function collapse in the basis determined by
the premeasurement process. We present a simple result for the total
information extracted after $N$ such weak measurements. Building upon MMS, we
propose a construction that maps a history of a quantum system onto a set of
$A$-qubits. It resembles the Consistent History (CH) formulation of Quantum
Mechanics (QM), but is distinct from it, and is built entirely within the
conventional QM. In particular, consistency postulate of CH formalism is not
automatically satisfied, but rather is an emerging property. Namely, each
measurement event corresponds to the branching of mutually exclusive classical
realities whose probabilities are additive. In a general case, however, the
superposition between different histories is determined by the history density
matrix.

path-following control law for multiple robotic vehicles that optimally
balances the transient trade-off between coordination and path-following
errors. To this end, we formulate a more general multi-agent framework where
each agent is associated with (i) a continuous-time dynamical model, which
governs the evolution of its state, and (ii) an output equation that is a
function of both the state of the agent and a coordination vector. According to
a given network topology, each agent can access its state and coordination
vector, as well as the coordination vectors of the neighboring agents. In this
setup, the goal is to design a distributed control law that steers the output
signals to the origin, while simultaneously driving the coordination vectors of
the agents of the network to consensus. To solve this, we propose a model
predictive control scheme that builds on a pre-existing auxiliary consensus
control law to design a performance index that combines the output regulation
objective with the consensus objective. Convergence guarantees under which one
can solve this coordinated output regulation problem are provided. Numerical
simulations display the effectiveness of the proposed scheme applied to a
cooperative path following control problem of a network of 3D nonholonomic
robotic vehicles.

localization is synonymous with insulating behavior in the thermodynamic limit.
Here we show that the same is not true for algebraic localization. We show, on
general grounds, that depending on the strength of the algebraic decay, the
algebraically localized states can be actually either conducting or insulating
in thermodynamic limit. We exemplify this statement with explicit calculations
on the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model in presence of power-law hopping, with the
power-law exponent $\alpha>1$, so that the thermodynamic limit is well-defined.
We find a phase of this system where there is a mobility edge separating
completely delocalized and algebraically localized states, with the
algebraically localized states showing signatures of super-diffusive transport.
Thus, in this phase, the mobility edge separates two kinds of conducting
states, ballistic and super-diffusive. We trace the occurrence of this behavior
to near-resonance conditions of the on-site energies that occur due to the
quasi-periodic nature of the potential.

quantum channel that transforms one pair into the other. The theory of quantum
statistical comparison and quantum relative majorization provides necessary and
sufficient conditions for such a transformation to exist, but such conditions
are typically difficult to check in practice. Here, by building upon work by
Matsumoto, we relax the problem by allowing for small errors in one of the
transformations. In this way, a simple sufficient condition can be formulated
in terms of one-shot relative entropies of the two pairs. In the asymptotic
setting where we consider sequences of state pairs, under some mild convergence
conditions, this implies that the quantum relative entropy is the only relevant
quantity deciding when a pairwise state transformation is possible. More
precisely, if the relative entropy of the initial state pair is strictly larger
compared to the relative entropy of the target state pair, then a
transformation with exponentially vanishing error is possible. On the other
hand, if the relative entropy of the target state is strictly larger, then any
such transformation will have an error converging exponentially to one. As an
immediate consequence, we show that the rate at which pairs of states can be
transformed into each other is given by the ratio of their relative entropies.
We discuss applications to the resource theories of athermality and coherence.

solve the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem becomes
critical. In order to tackle this problem, autonomous vehicles rely on sensor
suites that provide them with information about their operating environment.
When large scale production is taken into consideration, a trade-off between an
acceptable sensor suite cost and its resulting performance characteristics
arises. Furthermore, guaranteeing the system's performance requires a resilient
sensor network design. This work seeks to address such trade-offs by
introducing a method that takes into account the performance, cost, and
resiliency of distinct sensor selections. As a result, this method is able to
offer sensor combination recommendations based on the vehicle's operating
environment. It is found that the structure of the environment influences
sensor placement, and that the design of a resilient sensor network involves
careful consideration of both environmental attributes such as landmark density
and location, as well as the available types of complimentary sensors.
Demonstration of the proposed approach is shown by evaluating it using
sequences from the KITTI Benchmark Suite.

We outline the specific challenges offered by modeling star forming
environments, which are dominated by supersonic and super-Alfvenic turbulence
in a radiative, self-gravitating fluid. These conditions are rather unique in
physics and engineering and pose particularly severe restrictions on the
robustness and accuracy of numerical codes. One striking aspect is the
formation of collapsing fluid elements leading to the formation of
singularities that represent point-like objects, namely the proto-stars.
Although a few studies have attempted to resolve the formation of the first and
second Larson cores, resolution limitations force us to use sink particle
techniques, with sub-grid models to compute the accretion rates of mass,
momentum and energy, as well as their ejection rate due to radiation and jets
from the proto-stars. We discuss the most popular discretisation techniques
used in the community, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics, finite
difference and finite volume methods, stressing the importance to maintain a
divergence-free magnetic field. We discuss how to estimate the truncation error
of a given numerical scheme, and its importance in setting the magnitude of the
numerical diffusion. This can have a strong impact on the outcome of these MHD
simulations, where both viscosity and resistivity are implemented at the grid
scale. We then present various numerical techniques to model non-ideal MHD
effects, such as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion, as well as the Hall effect.
These important physical ingredients are posing strong challenges in term of
resolution and time stepping. For the latter, several strategies are discussed
to overcome the limitations due to prohibitively small time steps (abridged).

popular way to infer the computational function of different brain regions.
These models are quantitatively assessed by comparing the low-dimensional
neural representations of the model with the brain, for example using canonical
correlation analysis (CCA). However, the nature of the detailed neurobiological
inferences one can draw from such efforts remains elusive. For example, to what
extent does training neural networks to solve common tasks uniquely determine
the network dynamics, independent of modeling architectural choices? Or
alternatively, are the learned dynamics highly sensitive to different model
choices? Knowing the answer to these questions has strong implications for
whether and how we should use task-based RNN modeling to understand brain
dynamics. To address these foundational questions, we study populations of
thousands of networks, with commonly used RNN architectures, trained to solve
neuroscientifically motivated tasks and characterize their nonlinear dynamics.
We find the geometry of the RNN representations can be highly sensitive to
different network architectures, yielding a cautionary tale for measures of
similarity that rely representational geometry, such as CCA. Moreover, we find
that while the geometry of neural dynamics can vary greatly across
architectures, the underlying computational scaffold---the topological
structure of fixed points, transitions between them, limit cycles, and
linearized dynamics---often appears universal across all architectures.

magnetically-ordered V sites exist, whereas only one magnetically-ordered V
site is observed for $T_{FM1} < T\,< T_{FM2}$. Whereas $T_{FM1}$ is almost
unaffected by external pressure, $T_{FM2}$ is highly responsive to pressure and
merges with the $T_{FM1}$ line at $p \approx 0.6 $GPa. At even higher pressures
($p \approx $1.25\,GPa), the $T_{FM2}$ line merges with the structural
transition at $T_s$ which becomes moderately suppressed with $p$ for $p < 1.25$
GPa. Taken together, our data point towards a complex magnetic structure and an
interesting interplay of magnetic and structural degrees of freedom in VI$_3$.

[Phys. Rev. Lett., \textbf{117}, 096401 (2016)]. However, to date the
underlying mechanism, as to why its (0001) surface exhibits an anomalously
large electron-phonon coupling effect ($\lambda_{e-ph}^s$ $\approx$ 1.0),
remains unresolved. Here, by means of first-principles calculations we have
evidenced that the coupling of the DNSSs with the phononic states mainly
contributes to its novel surface \emph{e-ph} enhancement. Besides that the
experimentally observed $\lambda_{e-ph}^s$ and the main Eliashberg coupling

$\alpha^{2}$$F$(\emph{k},\textbf{\emph{q}};\emph{v}), and the \emph{e-ph}
coupling strength $\lambda(\emph{k},\textbf{\emph{q}};\emph{v})$ as a function
of each electron momentum (\emph{k}), each phonon momentum (\textbf{\emph{q}})

$\lambda(\emph{k},\textbf{\emph{q}};\emph{v})$. The results reveal the strong
\emph{e-ph} coupling between the DNSSs and the phonon modes, which contributes

traffic flow, regional rainfall is inherently stochastic and unpredictable.
Recently, deep learning based ST prediction models are proposed to learn the ST
characteristics of data. However, it is still very challenging (1) to
adequately learn the complex and non-linear ST relationships; (2) to model the
high variations in the ST data volumes as it is inherently dynamic, changing
over time (i.e., irregular) and highly influenced by many external factors,
such as adverse weather, accidents, traffic control, PoI, etc.; and (3) as
there can be many complicated external factors that can affect the accuracy and
it is impossible to list them explicitly. To handle the aforementioned issues,
in this paper, we propose a novel deep generative adversarial network based
model (named, D-GAN) for more accurate ST prediction by implicitly learning ST
feature representations in an unsupervised manner. D-GAN adopts a GAN-based
structure and jointly learns generation and variational inference of data. More
specifically, D-GAN consists of two major parts: (1) a deep ST feature learning
network to model the ST correlations and semantic variations, and underlying
factors of variations and irregularity in the data through the implicit
distribution modelling; (2) a fusion module to incorporate external factors for
reaching a better inference. To the best our knowledge, no prior work studies
ST prediction problem via deep implicit generative model and in an unsupervised
manner. Extensive experiments performed on two real-world datasets show that
D-GAN achieves more accurate results than traditional as well as deep learning
based ST prediction methods.

merger times, as a function of the progenitor metallicity and initial triple
orbital distributions, and show that the typical eccentricity in the LIGO band

mimics the awareness of some pedestrians of the geometry of the corridor and of

the system enhances the evacuation rate of all particles from the corridor. A
similar effect is also observed when looking at the outgoing particle flux,
when the system is in contact with an external particle reservoir that induces
the onset of a steady state. We interpret this phenomenon as a discrete space

computed relative to graph neighbourhoods within the varying time horizon of

well described either by a three-component continuum model consisting of a disk
blackbody, a single temperature blackbody and a power-law or by a two-component
continuum model consisting of a disk blackbody and a Comptonization component.
A broad iron line $\sim 5-8$ keV and the Compton back-scattering hump peaking
at $\sim$10-20 keV band are clearly detected in the X-ray spectrum. These
features are best interpreted by a self-consistent relativistic reflection
model. Fits with relativistically blurred disc reflection model suggests that
the inner disc radius $R_{in}$ is truncated prior to the ISCO at
$(1.9-2.5)\;R_{ISCO}$ ($\simeq11.4-15\,R_{g}\: \text{or}\: 26-34$ km) and the
accretion disc is viewed at an low inclination of $i\simeq16^\circ-20^\circ$.
The disc is likely to be truncated either by a boundary layer or by the
magnetosphere. Based on the measured flux and the mass accretion rate, the
maximum radial extension for the boundary layer is estimated to be
$\sim6.4\:R_{g}$ from the NS surface. The truncated inner disc in association
with pressure from a magnetic field sets an upper limit of
$B\leq1.9\times10^{9}$ G.

The combustion phasing model combines a knock integral model, burn duration

is designed for closed-loop control, and a feedforward model-based controller
is designed for open-loop control. These two control approaches were tested in
simulations. The simulation results show that during transient changes the CA50

the horizontal plane bounded by a closed curve $\Gamma$, and reflected at each
impact with $\Gamma$. The region is called a `billiard', and the reflections
are specular: the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. We review
the dynamics in the case of an elliptical billiard. In addition to conservation
of energy, the quantity $L_1 L_2$ is an integral of the motion, where $L_1$ and
$L_2$ are the angular momenta about the two foci. We can regularize the
billiard problem by approximating the flat-bedded, hard-edged surface by a
smooth function. We then obtain solutions that are everywhere continuous and
differentiable. We call such a regularized potential a `ballyard'. A class of
ballyard potentials will be defined that yield systems that are completely
integrable. We find a new integral of the motion that corresponds, in the
billiards limit $N\to\infty$, to $L_1 L_2$. Just as for the billiard problem,
there is a separation of the orbits into boxes and loops. The discriminant that
determines the character of the solution is the sign of $L_1 L_2$ on the major

This overview of modeling can be a great replacement with complex numerical
methods or very time-consuming and disruptive measurement experimental process.
In this study, we develop the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS) method for mapping inputs and outputs together and understand the
behavior of the fluid flow from other output parameters of the bubble column
reactor. Neural cells can fully learn the process in their memory and after the
training stage, the fuzzy structure predicts the multiphase flow data. Four
inputs such as x coordinate, y coordinate, z coordinate, and air superficial
velocity and one output such as pressure gradient are considered in the
learning process of the ANFIS method. During the learning process, the
different number of the membership function, type of membership functions and
the number of inputs are examined to achieve the intelligent algorithm with
high accuracy. The results show that as the number of inputs increases the
accuracy of the ANFIS method rises up to R^2>0.99 almost for all cases, while
the increment in the number of rules has a effect on the intelligence of
artificial algorithm. This finding shows that the density of neural objects or
higher input parameters enables the moded for better understanding. We also
proposed a new evaluation of data in the bubble column reactor by mapping
inputs and outputs and shuffle all parameters together to understand the
behaviour of the multiphase flow as a function of either inputs or outputs.
This new process of mapping inputs and outputs data provides a framework to
fully understand the flow in the fluid domain in a short time of fuzzy

approach combines two quantities that separately assess the degree of
unpredictability of the dynamics and the lack of describability of the
structure in the Poincar\'e plane constructed from a given time series. As for
the former, we use the permutation entropy $S_{\rm p}$, while for the later, we
introduce an indicator, the {\em structurality} $\Delta$, which accounts for
the fraction of visited points in the Poincar\'e plane. The complexity measure
thus defined as the sum of those two components is validated by classifying in
the ($S_{\rm p}$,$\Delta$) space the complexity of several benchmark
dissipative and conservative dynamical systems. As an application, we show how
the metric can be used as a powerful biomarker for different cardiac
pathologies and to distinguish the dynamical complexity of two electrochemical

radial, low acceleration is obtained, using a regularized formulation of the
orbital motion and the method of multiple scales. Formulating the dynamics with
the Dromo special perturbation method allows us to separate the two
characteristic periods of the problem in a clear and physically significative
way, namely the orbital period and a period depending on the magnitude of the
perturbing acceleration. This second period becomes very large compared to the
orbital one for low thrust cases, allowing us to develop an accurate
approximate analytical solution through the method of multiple scales. Compared
to a regular expansion, the multiple scales solution retains the qualitative
contributions of both characteristic periods and has a longer validity range in
time. Looking at previous solutions for this problem, our approach has the
advantage of not requiring the evaluation of special functions or an initially
circular orbit. Furthermore, the simple expression reached for the long period
provides additional insight on the problem. Finally, the behavior of the
asymptotic solution is assessed through several test cases, finding a good
agreement with high-precision numerical solutions. The results presented not
only advance in the study of the two body problem with constant radial thrust,

attention in recent years. In the absence of a formal definition, most studies
operationalize the notion of a conversation group either through a spatial or a
temporal lens. Spatially, the most commonly used representation is the
F-formation, defined by social scientists as the configuration in which people
arrange themselves to sustain an interaction. However, the use of this
representation is often accompanied with the simplifying assumption that a
single conversation occurs within an F-formation. Temporally, various
categories have been used to organize conversational units; these include,
among others, turn, topic, and floor. Some of these concepts are hard to define
objectively by themselves. The present work constitutes an initial exploration
into unifying these perspectives by primarily posing the question: can we use
the observation of simultaneous speaker turns to infer whether multiple
conversation floors exist within an F-formation? We motivate a metric for the
existence of distinct conversation floors based on simultaneous speaker turns,
and provide an analysis using this metric to characterize conversations across
F-formations of varying cardinality. We contribute two key findings: firstly,
at the average speaking turn duration of about two seconds for humans, there is
evidence for the existence of multiple floors within an F-formation; and
secondly, an increase in the cardinality of an F-formation correlates with a
decrease in duration of simultaneous speaking turns.

to find its core point using Poincare index and carry out enhancement using

continuous development of Deep Learning, many advanced academic and industrial
outcomes are established on localising and classifying the target objects, such

concept of Deep Learning, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and associated training
are highly integrated with task-driven modelling, having great effects on
accurate detection. The main focus of improving detection performance is
proposing DNNs with extra layers and novel topological connections to extract
the desired features from input data. However, training these models can be
computationally expensive and laborious progress as the complicated model
architecture and enormous parameters. Besides, the dataset is another reason
causing this issue and low detection accuracy, because of insufficient data
samples or difficult instances. To address these training difficulties, this
thesis presents two different approaches to improve the detection performance

deep learning, the first approach is ""slot-based image augmentation"" to enrich
the dataset with extra foreground and background combinations. Instead of the
commonly used image flipping method, the proposed system achieved similar mAP
improvement with less extra images which decrease training time. This proposed
