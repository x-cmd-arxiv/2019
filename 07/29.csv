coordinates on flat space and on a space-time with a spatial section given by a
compact manifold in the usual canonical formalism. The simpler 2+1 dimension is
chosen because renormalization is needed only for the mass difference but not
required for the coupling constant and the wavefunction. The model is
constructed non-perturbatively based on the resolvent formulation [1]. The
bound state spectrum is studied through its ``principal operator"" and bounds
for the ground state energy are obtained. We show that the formal expression
found indeed defines the resolvent of a self-adjoint operator--the Hamiltonian
of the interacting system. Moreover, we prove an essential result that the
principal operator corresponds to a self-adjoint holomorphic family of type-A
in the sense of Kato.

for assessing the error or variability of machine learning and statistical

different weighted versions of the original dataset, which can be prohibitively
time-consuming. For sufficiently regular optimization problems the optimum
depends smoothly on the data weights, and so the process of repeatedly
re-fitting can be approximated with a Taylor series that can be often evaluated
relatively quickly. The first-order approximation is known as the
""infinitesimal jackknife"" in the statistics literature and has been the subject
of recent interest in machine learning for approximate CV. In this work, we
consider high-order approximations, which we call the ""higher-order

simple recursive procedure to compute approximations of all orders with
finite-sample accuracy bounds. Additionally, we show that the HOIJ can be
efficiently computed even in high dimensions using forward-mode automatic
differentiation. We show that a linear approximation with bootstrap weights
approximation is equivalent to those provided by asymptotic normal
approximations. Consequently, the HOIJ opens up the possibility of enjoying
higher-order accuracy properties of the bootstrap using local approximations.
Consistency of the HOIJ for leave-one-out CV under different asymptotic regimes

emerging advertising forms and supplies are growing, it's crucial for sponsored

reducing the cost of solving large sparse systems of linear equations. It has
been studied for nearly half a century and has a rich history of bridging
techniques from data structures, graph algorithms, and scientific computing. In
this paper, we present a simple but novel combinatorial algorithm for computing
an exact minimum degree elimination ordering in $O(nm)$ time, which improves on
the best known time complexity of $O(n^3)$ and offers practical improvements
for sparse systems with small values of $m$. Our approach leverages a careful
amortized analysis, which also allows us to derive output-sensitive bounds for
the running time of $O(\min\{m\sqrt{m^+}, \Delta m^+\} \log n)$, where $m^+$ is
the number of unique fill edges and original edges that the algorithm
encounters and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the input graph.
  Furthermore, we show there cannot exist an exact minimum degree algorithm
that runs in $O(nm^{1-\varepsilon})$ time, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, assuming
the strong exponential time hypothesis. This fine-grained reduction goes
through the orthogonal vectors problem and uses a new low-degree graph
construction called $U$-fillers, which act as pathological inputs and cause any
minimum degree algorithm to exhibit nearly worst-case performance. With these
two results, we nearly characterize the time complexity of computing an exact
minimum degree ordering.

current TeV source population associated with energetic pulsars, in terms of
size and estimated energy density. Based on two alternative estimators we
conclude that a large majority of the known TeV sources have emission
originating in the zone energetically and dynamically dominated by the pulsar
(i.e. the pulsar wind nebula), rather than from a halo of particles diffusing
in to the ISM. Furthermore, whilst the number of established halos will surely
increase in the future, we find that it is unlikely that such halos contribute
significantly to the total TeV $\gamma$-ray luminosity from electrons
accelerated in PWN.

  Scaling",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ""Text can appear anywhere"". This property requires us to carefully process
all the pixels in an image in order to accurately localize all text instances.
In particular, for the more difficult task of localizing small text regions,
many methods use an enlarged image or even several rescaled ones as their
input. This significantly increases the processing time of the entire image and
needlessly enlarges background regions. If we were to have a prior telling us
the coarse location of text instances in the image and their approximate scale,
we could have adaptively chosen which regions to process and how to rescale
them, thus significantly reducing the processing time. To estimate this prior
we propose a segmentation-based network with an additional ""scale predictor"",
an output channel that predicts the scale of each text segment. The network is
applied on a scaled down image to efficiently approximate the desired prior,
without processing all the pixels of the original image. The approximated prior
is then used to create a compact image containing only text regions, resized to
a canonical scale, which is fed again to the segmentation network for
fine-grained detection. We show that our approach offers a powerful alternative
to fixed scaling schemes, achieving an equivalent accuracy to larger input
scales while processing far fewer pixels. Qualitative and quantitative results
are presented on the ICDAR15 and ICDAR17 MLT benchmarks to validate our
approach.

generically find that any localized eigenstate is a very good approximation for
an eigenstate of a distinct parent Hamiltonian, with an energy variance
$\sigma_\mathrm{P}^2(L)=\langle\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{P}^2\rangle_{\Psi_0}-\langle\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{P}\rangle_{\Psi_0}^2$

related to a chain-breaking mechanism, also signalled by bottlenecks of
vanishing entanglement entropy. A similar phenomenology is observed for both
Anderson and MBL. In contrast, delocalized ergodic many-body eigenstates
uniquely encode the Hamiltonian in the sense that $\sigma_\mathrm{P}^2(L)$
remains finite at the thermodynamic limit, i.e., $L\to+\infty$. As a direct

of the resonance frequency or impedance bandwidth results in the variation of
the current and field distributions. In this regard, this work adopts the
concept of characteristic modes to gain an initial understanding of the
perturbation mechanism of the rectangular patch when loaded with a slot. The
performance of microstrip antennas with finite ground plane is then studied
using full-wave simulation. It has been found that the distribution of the
induced current density is highly dependent on the orientation of the slot The
incorporation of a narrow slot suppresses the nearby orthogonal eigen mode and,
as a consequence, the radiation behavior is affected. Specifically, in the
presence of biological tissues in the near-field region, both antenna input
impedance properties and the realized gain are dependent on the slot
orientation. Different examples are included for understanding the impact of
slot loading on the energy absorption by biological tissues, by calculating the
the specific absorption rate (SAR). The proposed analysis facilitates the
design of miniaturized antenna geometries for biomedical applications via

  Development",,,,,"cs.SE cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To build secure software, developers often work together during software
development and maintenance to find, fix, and prevent security vulnerabilities.
Examining the nature of developer interactions during their security activities
regarding security introducing and fixing activities can provide insights for
improving current practices.
  In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to characterize and
understand developers' interactions during their security activities regarding
security introducing and fixing, which involves more than 16K security fixing
commits and over 28K security introducing commits from nine large-scale
open-source software projects. For our analysis, we first examine whether a
project is a hero-centric project when assessing developers' contribution in
their security activities. Then we study the interaction patterns between
developers, explore how the distribution of the patterns changes over time, and
study the impact of developers' interactions on the quality of projects. In
addition, we also characterize the nature of developer interaction in security
activities in comparison to developer interaction in non-security activities
(i.e., introducing and fixing non-security bugs). Among our findings we
identify that: most of the experimental projects are non hero-centric projects
when evaluating developers' contribution by using their security activities;
there exist common dominating interaction patterns across our experimental
projects; the distribution of interaction patterns has correlation with the
quality of software projects. We believe the findings from this study can help
developers understand how vulnerabilitiesoriginate and fix under the
interactions of software developers.

the spatial statistics and causal inference literatures, but concepts and
approaches have remained largely separated. In this paper, we aim to bridge
these distinct strands of statistics by considering unmeasured spatial
confounding within a causal inference framework, and estimating effects using
outcome regression tools popular within the spatial literature. First, we show
how using spatially correlated random effects in the outcome model, an approach
common among spatial statisticians, does not necessarily mitigate bias due to
spatial confounding, a previously published but not universally known result.
Motivated by the bias term of commonly-used estimators, we propose an affine
estimator which addresses this deficiency. We discuss how unbiased estimation
of causal parameters in the presence of unmeasured spatial confounding can only
be achieved under an untestable set of assumptions which will often be
application-specific. We provide a set of assumptions which describe how the
exposure and outcome of interest relate to the unmeasured variables, and we
show that this set of assumptions is sufficient for identification of the
causal effect based on the observed data when spatial dependencies can be
represented by a ring graph. We implement our method using a fully Bayesian
approach applicable to any type of outcome variable. This work is motivated by
and used to estimate the effect of county-level limited access to supermarkets
on the rate of cardiovascular disease deaths in the elderly across the whole
continental United States. Even though standard approaches return null or
protective effects, our approach uncovers evidence of unobserved spatial
confounding, and indicates that limited supermarket access has a harmful effect
on cardiovascular mortality.

in computing a spanning tree with communication sublinear in the number of
edges in an asynchronous CONGEST network appeared in DISC 2018. That algorithm
which constructs an MST is sequential in the worst case; its running time is
proportional to the total number of messages sent. Our paper matches its
message complexity but brings the running time down to linear in $n$. Our
techniques can also be used to provide an asynchronous algorithm with sublinear
communication to construct a tree in which the distance from a source to each
node is within an additive term of $\sqrt{n}$ of its actual distance.
  We can convert any asynchronous MST algorithm with time $T(n, m)$ and message
complexity of $M(n, m)$ to an algorithm with time $O(n^{1 - 2\epsilon} + T(n,
n^{3/2 + \epsilon}))$ and message complexity of $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2 + \epsilon} +
M(n, n^{3/2+\epsilon}))$, for $\epsilon \in [0, 1/4]$. Picking $\epsilon = 0$
and using Awerbuch's algorithm \cite{awerbuch1987optimal}, this results in an
MST algorithm with time $O(n)$ and message complexity $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$.
However, if there were an asynchronous MST algorithm that takes time sublinear
in $n$ and requires messages linear in $m$, by picking $\epsilon > 0$ we could
achieve sublinear time (in $n$) and sublinear communication (in $m$),
simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such algorithm.

progress. Most holographic models have focused on the low temperature limit,
where the linear-$T$ resistivity has been explained by the infrared geometry.
We extend this analysis to high temperature and identify the conditions for a
robust linear-$T$ resistivity up to high temperature. This extension is
important because, in experiment, the linear-$T$ resistivity is observed in a
large range of temperatures, up to room temperature. In the axion-dilaton
theories we find that, to have a robust linear-$T$ resistivity, the strong
momentum relaxation is a necessary condition, which agrees with the previous
result for the Guber-Rocha model. However, it is not sufficient in the sense
that, among large range of parameters giving a linear-$T$ resistivity in low
temperature limit, only very limited parameters can support the linear-$T$
resistivity up to high temperature even in strong momentum relaxation. We also
show that the incoherent term in the general holographic conductivity formula
or the coupling between the dilaton and Maxwell term is responsible for a
robust linear-$T$ resistivity up to high temperature.

single electron non-minimally coupled to an external electromagnetic field.
Making direct use of the field equation, instead of canonically deriving from
the Lagrangian density, the relativistic total angular momentum is attained,
where the effect of the relativistic torque due to the external sources is also
taken into account. Both the spin density and the orbital angular momentum
tensors are identified in the relativistic-covariant approach. Furthermore, the
symmetric and gauge invariant energy-momentum tensor is derived as well. In
addition, to inspect the non-relativistic regime, a perturbative expansion of
the field equation up to the leading order in $\left(v/c\right)$ is carried
out, where spin-orbit interaction terms naturally emerge in the
non-relativistic Hamiltonian as a consequence of the non-minimal coupling.
Features related to the spin currents, the spin-transfer torque and their
dependence on both magnetic and electric external fields are then calculated
and discussed. Considering that spin-orbit coupled systems are of particular
interest in the study of spin Hall effect, a two-dimensional (planar) scenario
of the system is contemplated, where the contributions to the Landau levels are
re-assessed. As a consequence of the planar regime and the non-minimal
coupling, a peculiar sort of fractionalization of the spin-up and -down
components emerges with the different spin components localized in distinct
positions.

However, developing a systematic analytics approach for production planning is
challenging due to the large volume of production data, the complex dependency

studies only provide summarized results and fail to show details for
comparative analysis of production plans. Besides, the rapid adjustment to the
plan in the case of an unanticipated incident is also not supported. In this
paper, we propose PlanningVis, a visual analytics system to support the

visualizing various properties of individual products, and a production detail
view displaying the product dependency and the daily production details in
related factories. By integrating an automatic planning algorithm with
interactive visual explorations, PlanningVis can facilitate the efficient
optimization of daily production planning as well as support a quick response
to unanticipated incidents in manufacturing. Two case studies with real-world

node failures, several recent approaches have replaced gradient averaging with
robust aggregation methods. Such techniques can have high computational costs,

robustness guarantees. Other methods have instead used redundancy to guarantee
robustness, but can only tolerate limited number of Byzantine failures. In this
work, we present DETOX, a Byzantine-resilient distributed training framework

two steps, a filtering step that uses limited redundancy to significantly
reduce the effect of Byzantine nodes, and a hierarchical aggregation step that
can be used in tandem with any state-of-the-art robust aggregation method. We
show theoretically that this leads to a substantial increase in robustness, and
has a per iteration runtime that can be nearly linear in the number of compute
nodes. We provide extensive experiments over real distributed setups across a
variety of large-scale machine learning tasks, showing that DETOX leads to
orders of magnitude accuracy and speedup improvements over many

solutions to a system of nonlinear equations. We study the special case of a
system of quadratic equations, which shows up in many practical applications
such as the power grid and other infrastructure networks. This problem is a
generalization of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), which
is NP-Hard in the general setting. We develop approaches based on topological
degree theory to estimate bounds on the robustness margin of such systems. Our
methods use tools from convex analysis and optimization theory to cast the
problems of checking the conditions for robust feasibility as a nonlinear
optimization problem. We then develop inner bound and outer bound procedures
for this optimization problem, which could be solved efficiently to derive
lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the margin of robust feasibility. We
evaluate our approach numerically on standard instances taken from the MATPOWER

and one obvious approach is to arrange for the network to use only a subset of
the available features. In linear models, Lasso (or $\ell_1$-regularized)
regression assigns zero weights to the most irrelevant or redundant features,
and is widely used in data science. However the Lasso only applies to linear
models. Here we introduce LassoNet, a neural network framework with global
feature selection. Our approach enforces a hierarchy: specifically a feature
can participate in a hidden unit only if its linear representative is active.
Unlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a
modified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature
selection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an
entire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity. On
systematic experiments, LassoNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods for feature selection and regression. The LassoNet method uses
projected proximal gradient descent, and generalizes directly to deep networks.
It can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural
network.

to the origin assumes that resetting takes zero time: upon resetting the
diffusing particle is teleported back to the origin to start its motion anew.
However, in reality, getting from one place to another takes a finite amount of
time which must be accounted for as diffusion with resetting already serves as
a model for a myriad of processes in physics and beyond. Here we consider a
situation where upon resetting the diffusing particle returns to the origin at
a finite (rather than infinite) speed. This creates a coupling between the
particle's random position at the moment of resetting and its return time, and
further gives rise to a non-trivial cross-talk between two separate phases of
motion: the diffusive phase and the return phase. We show that each of these
phases relaxes to the stead-state in a unique manner; and while this could have
also rendered the total relaxation dynamics extremely non-trivial our analysis
surprisingly reveals otherwise. Indeed, the time-dependent distribution
describing the particle's position in our model is completely invariant to the
speed of return. Thus, whether returns are slow or fast, we always recover the
result originally obtained for diffusion with instantaneous returns to the
origin.

virtual normal directions determined by randomly sampled three points in the

accuracy. Significantly, the byproduct of this predicted depth being
sufficiently accurate is that we are now able to recover good 3D structures of
the scene such as the point cloud and surface normal directly from the depth,
eliminating the necessity of training new sub-models as was previously done.

holds one of two different opinions. In particular, we study the
\emph{Best-of-two} and the \emph{Best-of-three}. Here at each synchronous and
discrete time step, each vertex updates its opinion to match the majority among
the opinions of two random neighbors and itself (the Best-of-two) or the
opinions of three random neighbors (the Best-of-three). Previous studies have
explored these processes on complete graphs and expander graphs, but we
understand significantly less about their properties on graphs with more
complicated structures.
  In this paper, we study the Best-of-two and the Best-of-three on the
stochastic block model $G(2n,p,q)$, which is a random graph consisting of two
distinct Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $G(n,p)$ joined by random edges with density
$q\leq p$. We obtain two main results. First, if $p=\omega(\log n/n)$ and
$r=q/p$ is a constant, we show that there is a phase transition in $r$ with
threshold $r^*$ (specifically, $r^*=\sqrt{5}-2$ for the Best-of-two, and
$r^*=1/7$ for the Best-of-three). If $r>r^*$, the process reaches consensus
within $O(\log \log n+\log n/\log (np))$ steps for any initial opinion
configuration with a bias of $\Omega(n)$. By contrast, if $r<r^*$, then there
exists an initial opinion configuration with a bias of $\Omega(n)$ from which
the process requires at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$ steps to reach consensus. Second,
if $p$ is a constant and $r>r^*$, we show that, for any initial opinion
configuration, the process reaches consensus within $O(\log n)$ steps. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first result concerning multiple-choice
voting for arbitrary initial opinion configurations on non-complete graphs.

$X=-A_{\mu}A^{\mu}/2$, and $T_c$ is a trace of the CDM energy-momentum tensor.
The matter coupling affects the no-ghost condition and sound speed of linear
scalar perturbations deep inside the sound horizon, while those of tensor and
vector perturbations are not subject to modifications. The existence of
interactions also modifies the no-ghost condition of CDM density perturbations.
We propose a concrete model of coupled vector dark energy with the tensor
propagation speed equivalent to that of light. In comparison to the $Q=0$ case,
we show that the decay of CDM to the vector field leads to the phantom dark
energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ closer to $-1$. This alleviates the
problem of observational incompatibility of uncoupled models in which $w_{\rm
DE}$ significantly deviates from $-1$. The maximum values of $w_{\rm DE}$
reached during the matter era are bounded from the CDM no-ghost condition of
future de Sitter solutions.

  Images","Accepted in GCCE2019, Okinawa, Japan",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  JPEG is one of the popular image compression algorithms that provide
efficient storage and transmission capabilities in consumer electronics, and
hence it is the most preferred image format over the internet world. In the
present digital and Big-data era, a huge volume of JPEG compressed document
images are being archived and communicated through consumer electronics on
daily basis. Though it is advantageous to have data in the compressed form on
one side, however, on the other side processing with off-the-shelf methods
becomes computationally expensive because it requires decompression and
recompression operations. Therefore, it would be novel and efficient, if the
compressed data are processed directly in their respective compressed domains
of consumer electronics. In the present research paper, we propose to
demonstrate this idea taking the case study of printed text line segmentation.
Since, JPEG achieves compression by dividing the image into non overlapping 8x8
blocks in the pixel domain and using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT); it is
very likely that the partitioned 8x8 DCT blocks overlap the contents of two
adjacent text-lines without leaving any clue for the line separator, thus
making text-line segmentation a challenging problem. Two approaches of
segmentation have been proposed here using the DC projection profile and AC
coefficients of each 8x8 DCT block. The first approach is based on the strategy
of partial decompression of selected DCT blocks, and the second approach is
with intelligent analysis of F10 and F11 AC coefficients and without using any
type of decompression. The proposed methods have been tested with variable font
sizes, font style and spacing between lines, and a good performance is
reported.

a legitimate monitor attempts to eavesdrop two suspicious communication links
simultaneously. To facilitate concurrent eavesdropping, our multi-antenna
legitimate monitor employs a proactive eavesdropping via jamming approach, by
selectively jamming suspicious receivers to lower the transmission rates of the
target links. In particular, we are interested in characterizing the achievable
eavesdropping rate region for the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) receiver
case, by optimizing the legitimate monitor's jamming transmit covariance matrix
subject to its power budget. As the monitor cannot hear more than what
suspicious links transmit, the achievable eavesdropping rate region is
essentially the intersection of the achievable rate region for the two
suspicious links and that for the two eavesdropping links. The former region
can be purposely altered by the monitor's jamming transmit covariance matrix,
whereas the latter region is fixed when the MMSE receiver is employed.
Therefore, we first analytically characterize the achievable rate region for
the two suspicious links via optimizing the jamming transmit covariance matrix
and then obtain the achievable eavesdropping rate region for the MMSE receiver
case. Furthermore, we also extend our study to the MMSE with successive
interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) receiver case and characterize the
corresponding achievable eavesdropping rate region by jointly optimizing the
time-sharing factor between different decoding orders. Finally, numerical
results are provided to corroborate our analysis and examine the eavesdropping

  Comptes Rendus Physique, Elsevier Masson, A para{\^i}tre",,"10.5802/crphys.1",,"cond-mat.quant-gas","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The pair-condensed unpolarized spin-$1/2$ Fermi gases have a collective
excitation branch in their pair-breaking continuum (V.A. Andrianov, V.N. Popov,
1976). We study it at zero temperature, with the eigenenergy equation deduced
from the linearized time-dependent BCS theory and extended analytically to the
lower half complex plane through its branch cut, calculating both the
dispersion relation and the spectral weights (quasiparticle residues) of the
branch. In the case of BCS superconductors, so called because the effect of the
ion lattice is replaced by a short-range electron-electron interaction, we also
include the Coulomb interaction and we restrict ourselves to the weak coupling
limit $\Delta/\mu\to 0^+$ ($\Delta$ is the order parameter, $\mu $ the chemical
potential) and to wavenumbers $q=O(1/\xi)$ where $\xi$ is the size of a pair;
when the complex energy $z_q$ is expressed in units of $\Delta$ and $q$ in
units of $1/\xi$, the branch follows a universal law insensitive to the Coulomb
interaction. In the case of cold atoms in the BEC-BCS crossover, only a contact
interaction remains, but the coupling strength $\Delta/\mu$ can take arbitrary
values, and we study the branch at any wave number. At weak coupling, we
predict three scales, that already mentioned $q\approx 1/\xi$, that
$q\approx(\Delta/\mu)^{-1/3}/\xi$ where the real part of the dispersion
relation has a minimum and that $q\approx (\mu/\Delta)/\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$
($k_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave number) where the branch reaches the edge of its
existence domain. Near the point where the chemical potential vanishes on the
BCS side, $\mu/\Delta\to 0^+$, where $\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$, we find two scales
$q\approx(\mu/\Delta)^{1/2}/\xi$ and $q\approx 1/\xi$. In all cases, the branch
has a limit $2\Delta$ and a quadratic start at $q=0$. These results were
obtained for $\mu>0$, where the eigenenergy equation admits at least two branch
points $\epsilon_a(q)$ and $\epsilon_b(q)$ on the positive real axis, and for
an analytic continuation through the interval $[\epsilon_a(q),\epsilon_b(q)] $.
We find new continuum branches by performing the analytic continuation through
$[\epsilon_b(q),+\infty[$ or even, for $q$ low enough, where there is a third
real positive branch point $\epsilon_c(q)$, through
$[\epsilon_b(q),\epsilon_c(q)]$ and $[\epsilon_c(q),+\infty[$. On the BEC side
$\mu<0$ not previously studied, where there is only one real positive branch
point $ \epsilon_a(q)$, we also find new collective excitation branches under
the branch cut $[\epsilon_a (q),+\infty[$. For $\mu>0$, some of these new
branches have a low-wavenumber exotic hypoacoustic $z_q\approx q^{3/2}$ or
hyperacoustic $z_q\approx q^{4/5}$ behavior. For $\mu<0$, we find a
hyperacoustic branch and a nonhypoacoustic branch, with a limit $2\Delta$ and a
purely real quadratic start at $q=0$ for $\Delta/|\mu|<0.222$.

  Framework for Whole-Heart Segmentation","9 pages, accepted by MICCAI'19",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When introducing advanced image computing algorithms, e.g., whole-heart
segmentation, into clinical practice, a common suspicion is how reliable the
automatically computed results are. In fact, it is important to find out the
failure cases and identify the misclassified pixels so that they can be
excluded or corrected for the subsequent analysis or diagnosis. However, it is
not a trivial problem to predict the errors in a segmentation mask when ground
truth (usually annotated by experts) is absent. In this work, we attempt to
address the pixel-wise error map prediction problem and the per-case mask
quality assessment problem using a unified deep learning (DL) framework.
Specifically, we first formalize an error map prediction problem, then we
convert it to a segmentation problem and build a DL network to tackle it. We
also derive a quality indicator (QI) from a predicted error map to measure the
overall quality of a segmentation mask. To evaluate the proposed framework, we
perform extensive experiments on a public whole-heart segmentation dataset,
i.e., MICCAI 2017 MMWHS. By 5-fold cross validation, we obtain an overall Dice
score of 0.626 for the error map prediction task, and observe a high Pearson
correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.972 between QI and the actual segmentation
accuracy (Acc), as well as a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0048 between
them, which evidences the efficacy of our method in both error map prediction
and quality assessment.

encrypted images into the low-dimensional feature space, where essential
information of plain images has been largely preserved. With the
low-dimensional features, a deconvolutional generator is utilized to regenerate
perceptually similar decrypted images to approximate the plain images in the
high-dimensional space. Compared with conventional image encryption attack
algorithms, the proposed method does not require to manually analyze and infer
keys in a time-consuming way. Instead, we directly attack the chaos-based
encryption algorithms in a key-independent manner. Moreover, the proposed
method can be trained end-to-end. Given the chaos-based encrypted images, a
well-trained decryption model is able to automatically reconstruct plain images
with high fidelity. In the experiments, we successfully attack the chaos-based

their ground truth plain images. Experimental results on both static-key and

method, our method applies deep-pose regression neural networks in a reduced
domain (i.e., 2-dimensional image). Subsequently, fine registration is
performed via optimal clusters. Majority voting system achieves globally
optimal transformations while each cluster attempts to optimize local
transformation parameters. The coherency of clusters determines their candidacy
for the optimal cluster set. The outlying regions in the iso-surface are
effectively removed based on the consensus among the optimal clusters. The
accuracy of registration was evaluated by the Euclidean distance of 10
landmarks on a scanned model which were annotated by the experts in the field.
The experiments show that the proposed method's registration accuracy, measured
in landmark distance, outperforms other existing methods by 30.77% to 70%. In
addition to achieving high accuracy, our proposed method requires neither

significance of our study is twofold: 1) the employment of light-weighted

extracting pose cues that can be easily obtained and 2) the introduction of an
optimal cluster-based registration method that can avoid metal artifacts during
the matching procedures.

precoding is optimized by Riemannian manifold optimization. If the digital
precoding is optimized by a locally optimal algorithm, we obtain a locally
optimal alternating maximization algorithm. In contrast, if we use a weighted
minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based iterative algorithm for digital
precoding, we obtain a suboptimal alternating maximization algorithm with
reduced complexity in each iteration. By characterizing the upper bound of the
weighted arithmetic and geometric means of mean square errors (MSEs), it is
shown that the two alternating maximization algorithms have similar performance
when the user specific weights do not have big differences. Verified by
numerical results, the performance gap between the two alternating maximization
algorithms becomes large when the ratio of the maximal and minimal weights
among users is very large. Moreover, we also propose a low-complexity
closed-form method without iterations. It employs matrix decomposition for the
analog beamforming and weighted MMSE for the digital beamforming. Although it
is not supposed to maximize the weighted spectral efficiency, it exhibits small
performance deterioration compared to the two iterative alternating
maximization algorithms and it qualifies as a good initialization for iterative
algorithms, saving thereby iterations.

the M_0 of ccSNe progenitors. We use Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis

models that do not consider binary systems yield stellar ages that are
systematically too young (thus M_0 too large), whereas accounting for binary
system interactions typically overpredict the stellar age (thus underpredict
M_0). Taking into account the effects of photon leakage bring our M_0 estimates

current methods exploit superficial statistics and dataset bias, rather than
learning to generalise over the specific representations they have experienced.
This is a critical concern because generalisation enables robust reasoning over
unseen data, whereas leveraging superficial statistics is fragile to even small
changes in data distribution. To illuminate the issue and drive progress
towards a solution, we propose a test that explicitly evaluates abstract
reasoning over visual data. We introduce a large-scale benchmark of visual
questions that involve operations fundamental to many high-level vision tasks,
such as comparisons of counts and logical operations on complex visual
properties. The benchmark directly measures a method's ability to infer
high-level relationships and to generalise them over image-based concepts. It
includes multiple training/test splits that require controlled levels of
generalization. We evaluate a range of deep learning architectures, and find
that existing models, including those popular for vision-and-language tasks,
are unable to solve seemingly-simple instances. Models using relational
networks fare better but leave substantial room for improvement.

matrix as the product of two sparse affinity matrices. There are two successive
attention modules each estimating a sparse affinity matrix. The first attention
module is used to estimate the affinities within a subset of positions that
have long spatial interval distances and the second attention module is used to
estimate the affinities within a subset of positions that have short spatial
interval distances. These two attention modules are designed so that each
position is able to receive the information from all the other positions. In
contrast to the original self-attention module, our approach decreases the
computation and memory complexity substantially especially when processing
high-resolution feature maps. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our
approach on six challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks.

mappings among multiple domains without relying on parallel data. This is
important but challenging owing to the requirement of learning multiple
mappings and the non-availability of explicit supervision. Recently, StarGAN-VC
has garnered attention owing to its ability to solve this problem only using a
single generator. However, there is still a gap between real and converted
speech. To bridge this gap, we rethink conditional methods of StarGAN-VC, which
are key components for achieving non-parallel multi-domain VC in a single
model, and propose an improved variant called StarGAN-VC2. Particularly, we
rethink conditional methods in two aspects: training objectives and network
architectures. For the former, we propose a source-and-target conditional
adversarial loss that allows all source domain data to be convertible to the
target domain data. For the latter, we introduce a modulation-based conditional
method that can transform the modulation of the acoustic feature in a
domain-specific manner. We evaluated our methods on non-parallel multi-speaker
VC. An objective evaluation demonstrates that our proposed methods improve
speech quality in terms of both global and local structure measures.
Furthermore, a subjective evaluation shows that StarGAN-VC2 outperforms
StarGAN-VC in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity. The converted speech

annotation, hampering its application at scale. With computer graphics, we can
generate almost unlimited training data with precise annotation. However,a deep
model trained with synthetic data usually cannot directly generalize well to
realistic images due to domain shift. It has been observed that highly
confident labels for the unlabeled real images may be predicted relying on the
labeled synthetic data. To tackle the unsupervised domain adaptation problem,
we explore the possibilities to generate high-quality labels as proxy labels to
supervise the training on target data. Specifically, we propose a novel
proxy-based method using multi-adversarial training. We first train the model
using synthetic data (source domain). Multiple discriminators are used to align
the features be-tween the source and target domain (real images) at different
levels. Then we focus on obtaining and selecting high-quality proxy labels by
incorporating both the confidence of the class predictor and that from the
adversarial discriminators. Our discriminators not only work as a regularizer
to encourage feature alignment but also provide an alternative confidence
measure for generating proxy labels. Relying on the generated high-quality
proxies, our model can be trained in a ""supervised manner"" on the target
do-main. On two major tasks, GTA5->Cityscapes and SYNTHIA->Cityscapes, our
method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming the previous by a large

the empirical $F$-, $G$-, and $J$-functions originally introduced for
inhomogeneous point processes on a Euclidean space. The fitted Cox process

areas of signal and image processing binary samples are crucial and such
samples, which can be modelled by Walsh functions, are the core of our

constitute each other's environment and respond to mutual changes. This
inherently far-from-equilibrium process finds striking manifestations in the
adaptive immune system, where highly variable antigens and a finite repertoire
of immune receptors coevolve on comparable timescales. This unique challenge to
the immune system motivates general questions: How do ecological and
evolutionary processes interplay to shape diversity? What determine the
endurance and fate of coevolution? Here, we take the perspective of responsive
environments and develop a phenotypic model of coevolution between receptors
and antigens that both exhibit cross-reactivity (one-to-many responses). The
theory predicts that the extent of asymmetry in cross-reactivity is a key
determinant of repertoire composition: small asymmetry supports persistent
large diversity, whereas strong asymmetry yields long-lived transients of
quasispecies in both populations. The latter represents a new type of Turing
mechanism. More surprisingly, patterning in the trait space feeds back on
population dynamics: spatial resonance between the Turing modes breaks the
dynamic balance, leading to antigen extinction or unrestrained growth. Model
predictions can be tested via combined genomic and phenotypic measurements. Our
work identifies cross-reactivity as an important regulator of diversity and
coevolutionary outcome, and reveals the remarkable effect of ecological
feedback in pattern-forming systems, which drives evolution toward non-steady
states different than the Red Queen persistent cycles.

large radius, for low and very high energy jets created in heavy ion collisions
at the LHC. We use the hybrid strong/weak coupling model for jet quenching that
combines perturbative shower evolution with an effective strongly coupled
description of the energy and momentum transfer from the jet into the
hydrodynamic quark-gluon plasma. Because of momentum conservation, the wake
created by the jet enhances or depletes the amount of particles generated at
the freeze-out hypersurface depending on their orientation with respect to the
jet. Within such framework we find that jet suppression is surprisingly
independent of the anti-$k_T$ radius $R$, first slightly increasing as one
increases $R$, then at larger values of $R$ very slowly decreasing. This nearly
independence of jet suppression with increasing values of $R$ arises from two
competing effects, namely the larger energy loss of the hard jet components,
which tends to increase suppression, versus the partial recovery of the lost
energy due to medium response, reducing suppression. We also find that the
boosted medium from the recoiling jet reduces the amount of plasma in the
direction opposite to it in the transverse plane, increasing the amount of jet
suppression due to an over-subtraction effect. We show that this characteristic
signature of the hydrodynamization of part of the jet energy can be quantified
by selecting samples of dijet configurations with different relative
pseudorapidities between the leading and the subleading jet.

constructed by the background superfield method, with the gauge-fixing term
involving one real parameter $\xi_0$. A manifestly gauge invariant and ${\cal

allows one to investigate their gauge dependence. As compared to the minimal

contains a new term depending on $\xi_0\,$. This term vanishes for the
background superfields satisfying the classical equations of motion, so that
the $S$-matrix divergences are gauge-independent. In the case of $6D$, ${\cal

In ablation experiments, we observed that the proposed attention mechanism

training requires fewer hyperparameters and achieves a better, more stable
performance than joint training. Finally, we analyze the features learned by
different methods and find that the attention mechanism helps to learn more
discriminative features in the deeper layers of encoders.

Cellular technology such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) is designed to perform

low-latency uplink traffic, which is needed for real-time command and control

persistent scheduling, using an open-source LTE stack. The approach is
evaluated with a laboratory setup using software-defined radio modules.
Measurements are taken on the application layer, using real-world telemetry
data generated by an autopilot system in the presence of high bandwidth

6 ms on average and a 99.9th percentile of 10 ms by application-aware

$0"".093\pm0"".006\times 0"".061\pm0"".004$ ( $1.14\times10^{16}$ cm $\times

position-velocity diagram, which is usually a defining characteristic of a
rotating gas ring around a large mass. The gas ring has a rotating velocity of
$V_\mathrm{rot}\simeq230$ km s$^{-1}$ and an orbit radius of
$r\simeq6\times10^{15}$ cm. From these orbit parameters, the enclosed mass is
estimated to be $M_{\mathrm{IMBH}}\simeq2.4\times10^4$ $M_\odot$. The mass is
within the astrometric upper limit mass of the object adjacent to Sgr
A$^{\ast}$. Considering IRS13E3 has an X-ray counterpart, the large enclosed
mass would be supporting evidence that IRS13E3 is an IMBH. Even if a dense
cluster corresponds to IRS13E3, the cluster would collapse into an IMBH within
$\tau<10^7$ years due to the very high mass density of $\rho
\gtrsim8\times10^{11} M_\odot pc^{-3}$. Because the orbital period is estimated
to be as short as $T=2\pi r/V_\mathrm{rot}\sim 50-100$ yr, the morphology of
the observed ionized gas ring is expected to be changed in the next several
decades. The mean electron temperature and density of the ionized gas are
$\bar{T}_{\mathrm e}=6800\pm700$ K and $\bar{n}_{\mathrm e}=6\times10^5$

the total observed ice velocity, in particular in dynamically active areas. It
is therefore important to accurately represent this process in numerical
models. The condition that the sliding velocity should be tangential to the bed
is realized by imposing an impenetrability condition at the base. We study the,
in glaciological literature used, numerical implementations of the
impenetrability condition for non-linear Stokes flow with Navier's slip on the
boundary. Using the finite element method, we enforce impenetrability by: a
local rotation of the coordinate system (strong method), a Lagrange multiplier
method enforcing zero average flow across each facet (weak method) and an
approximative method that uses the pressure variable as a Lagrange multiplier
for both incompressibility and impenetrability. An analysis of the latter shows
that it relaxes the incompressibility constraint, but enforces impenetrability
approximately if the pressure is close to the normal component of the stress at
the bed. Comparing the methods numerically using a method of manufactured
solutions unexpectedly leads to similar convergence results. However, we find
that, for more realistic cases, in areas of high sliding or varying topography
the velocity field simulated by the approximative method differs from that of
the other methods by $\sim 1\%$ (two-dimensional flow) and $> 5\%$ when
compared to the strong method (three-dimensional flow). In this study the
strong method, which is the most commonly used in numerical ice sheet models,
emerges as the preferred method due to its stable properties (compared to the
weak method in three dimensions) and ability to well enforce the
impenetrability condition.

Recent work focused on the success conditions of simple protocols such as

does not know b's secret. A protocol execution is successful if all agents get
to know all secrets. On partial networks these protocols sometimes fail because
they ignore information available to the agents that would allow for better
coordination. We study how epistemic protocols for dynamic gossip can be
strengthened, using epistemic logic as a simple protocol language with a new
operator for protocol-dependent knowledge. We provide definitions of different
strengthenings and show that they perform better than LNS, but we also prove
that there is no strengthening of LNS that always terminates successfully.
Together, this gives us a better picture of when and how epistemic coordination
can help in the dynamic gossip problem in particular and distributed systems in

learn the intricate phase diagram of a classical frustrated spin model. The

unsupervised context. Thanks to the interpretability of the machine we are able
to infer, in closed form, both order parameter tensors of phases with broken

and so characterize classical spin liquids. The method is applied to the
classical XXZ model on the pyrochlore lattice where it distinguishes---among
others---between a hidden biaxial spin nematic phase and several different
classical spin liquids. The results are in full agreement with a previous
analysis by Taillefumier \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. X 7, 041057 (2017)], but go
further by providing a systematic hierarchy between disordered regimes, and
establishing the physical relevance of the susceptibilities associated with the

This motion towards the origin takes place according to a given equation of

the influence of noise and decoherence. In such a fault-tolerant quantum
computer, noise-induced errors must be detected and corrected in real-time to
prevent them from propagating between components. This requirement is
especially pertinent while applying quantum gates, when the interaction between
components can cause errors to quickly spread throughout the system. However,
the large overhead involved in most fault-tolerant architectures makes
implementing these systems a daunting task, which motivates the search for
hardware-efficient alternatives. Here, we present a gate enacted by a
multilevel ancilla transmon on a cavity-encoded logical qubit that is
fault-tolerant with respect to decoherence in both the ancilla and the encoded
qubit. We maintain the purity of the encoded qubit in the presence of ancilla
errors by detecting those errors in real-time, and applying the appropriate
corrections. We show a reduction of the logical gate error by a factor of two
in the presence of naturally occurring decoherence, and demonstrate resilience
against ancilla bit-flips and phase-flips by observing a sixfold suppression of
the gate error with increased energy relaxation, and a fourfold suppression
with increased dephasing noise. The results demonstrate that bosonic logical
qubits can be controlled by error-prone ancilla qubits without inheriting the
ancilla's inferior performance. As such, error-corrected ancilla-enabled gates
are an important step towards fully fault-tolerant processing of bosonic
qubits.

which inherently reflects the steps required to solve the instance. We use
joinwidth to obtain polynomial-time algorithms (if a corresponding
decomposition is provided in the input) as well as fixed-parameter algorithms
(if no such decomposition is provided) for solving the CSP.
  Joinwidth is a hybrid parameter, as it takes both the graphical structure as
well as the constraint relations that appear in the instance into account. It
has, therefore, the potential to capture larger classes of tractable instances
than purely structural parameters like hypertree width and the more general
fractional hypertree width (fhtw). Indeed, we show that any class of instances
of bounded fhtw also has bounded joinwidth, and that there exist classes of
instances of bounded joinwidth and unbounded fhtw, so bounded joinwidth
properly generalizes bounded fhtw.
  We further show that bounded joinwidth also properly generalizes several
other known hybrid restrictions, such as fhtw with degree constraints and
functional dependencies. In this sense, bounded joinwidth can be seen as a
unifying principle that explains the tractability of several seemingly

sequential decision-making with partial information, where the only feedback

nucleus of a cell to the atomistic composition of the DNA, while bridging
several orders of magnitude in scale. The challenges in creating an interactive
visualization of genome data are fundamentally different in several ways from
those in other domains like astronomy that require a multi-scale representation
as well. First, genome data has intertwined scale levels---the DNA is an
extremely long, connected molecule that manifests itself at all scale levels.
Second, elements of the DNA do not disappear as one zooms out---instead the
scale levels at which they are observed group these elements differently.
Third, we have detailed information and thus geometry for the entire dataset
and for all scale levels, posing a challenge for interactive visual
exploration. Finally, the conceptual scale levels for genome data are close in
scale space, requiring us to find ways to visually embed a smaller scale into a
coarser one. We address these challenges by creating a new multi-scale
visualization concept. We use a scale-dependent camera model that controls the
visual embedding of the scales into their respective parents, the rendering of
a subset of the scale hierarchy, and the location, size, and scope of the view.
In traversing the scales, ScaleTrotter is roaming between 2D and 3D visual
representations that are depicted in integrated visuals. We discuss,
specifically, how this form of multi-scale visualization follows from the
specific characteristics of the genome data and describe its implementation.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our work to the general illustrative

cancer on MRI. We hypothesize that the inclusion of zonal information can
improve the performance of a deep learning based csPCa lesion detection model.
However, segmentation of prostate zones is challenging and therefore
deterministic models are inaccurate. Hence, we investigated probabilistic zonal
segmentation. Our baseline detection model is a 2DUNet trained to produce a
csPCa heatmap followed by a 3D detector. We experimented with the integration
of zonal prior information by fusing the output of an anisotropic 3DUNet
trained to produce either a deterministic or probabilistic map for each
prostate zone. We also investigate the effect of early or late fusion on csPCa
detection. All methods were trained and tested on 848 bpMRI. The results show
that fusing zonal prior knowledge improves the baseline detection model with a
preference for probabilistic over deterministic zonal segmentation.

First, accounts are identified by long and incompressible constants. Second,
these constants have to be stored and communicated for each payment. Third, the
standard interface for token transfers does not support lists of recipients,
adding repeated communication to the overhead. Since Ethereum charges resource
usage, even small optimizations translate to cost savings. Airdrops, a popular
marketing tool used to boost coin uptake, present a relevant example for the
value of optimizing bulk transfers. Therefore, we review technical solutions
for airdrops of Ethereum-based tokens, discuss features and prerequisites, and
compare the operational costs by simulating 35 scenarios. We find that cost
savings of factor two are possible, but require specific provisions in the
smart contract implementing the token system. Pull-based approaches, which use
on-chain interaction with the recipients, promise moderate savings for the
distributor while imposing a disproportional cost on each recipient. Total
costs are broadly linear in the number of recipients independent of the
technical approach. We publish the code of the simulation framework for

likelihood that future autonomous technology (referred to as AI/ML) would be
able to fully replace the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key tasks (e.g.
mental status exam, suicidality assessment, treatment planning) carried out in
mental health care. Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22
countries. Only 3.8% of respondents felt that AI/ML was likely to replace a
human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting (e.g. updating
medical records) and synthesizing information to reach a diagnosis were the two
tasks where a majority predicted that future AI/ML would replace human doctors.
About 1 in 2 doctors believed their jobs could be changed substantially by
future AI/ML. However, female and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the
possible benefits of AI would outweigh potential risks, versus their male and
global counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first global survey to seek
the opinions of physicians on the impact of autonomous AI/ML on the future of

about intelligent technologies which may better help us integrate such tools

properties of the reference point from which we observe the Universe.
Particularly for the determination of the Hubble constant with low-redshift
distance indicators, the values observed depend on the average matter density
within the distance range covered. Here we used the spatial distribution of
galaxy clusters to map the matter density distribution. The study is based on
our CLASSIX galaxy cluster survey, which is highly complete and well
characterised with galaxy clusters detected in X-rays. We find a local
underdensity in the cluster distribution of about 30 - 60% which extends ~85
Mpc to the north and ~170 Mpc to the south. For three regions for which the
galaxy density distribution has previously been studied, we find good agreement
between the density distribution of clusters and galaxies. Correcting for the
bias in the cluster distribution we infer an underdensity in the matter
distribution of about -0.3 +- 0.15 (-0.2 +- 0.1) in a region with a radius of
about 100 (~140) Mpc. Calculating the probability of finding such an
underdensity theoretically in a LambdaCDM universe with concordance
cosmological parameters, we find a probability characterised by sigma-values of
1.3-3.7. This indicates low probabilities, but with values of around 10% at the
lower uncertainty limit, the existence of an underdensity cannot be ruled out.
Inside this underdensity, the observed Hubble parameter will be larger by about
5.5 +2.1-2.8%, which explains part of the discrepancy between the locally
measured value of H_0 compared to the value of H_0 inferred from the Planck
observations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. If distance
indicators outside the local underdensity are included, as in many modern
analyses, this effect is diluted.

boundaries of argumentative text fragments and extracting their relationships.
Fully automated solutions do not reach satisfactory accuracy due to their
insufficient incorporation of semantics and domain knowledge. Therefore,
experts currently rely on time-consuming manual annotations. In this paper, we
present a visual analytics system that augments the manual annotation process
by automatically suggesting which text fragments to annotate next. The accuracy
of those suggestions is improved over time by incorporating linguistic
knowledge and language modeling to learn a measure of argument similarity from
user interactions. Based on a long-term collaboration with domain experts, we
identify and model five high-level analysis tasks. We enable close reading and
note-taking, annotation of arguments, argument reconstruction, extraction of
argument relations, and exploration of argument graphs. To avoid context
switches, we transition between all views through seamless morphing, visually
anchoring all text- and graph-based layers. We evaluate our system with a
two-stage expert user study based on a corpus of presidential debates. The
results show that experts prefer our system over existing solutions due to the
speedup provided by the automatic suggestions and the tight integration between
text and graph views.

the framework of the strong-coupling self-consistent $T$-matrix approximation,
we examine how a strong pairing interaction associated with a Feshbach

superfluid phase transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$. We show that, while $\eta$
diverges in both the weak-coupling BCS and strong-coupling BEC limits, it
becomes small in the unitary regime. The minimum of $\eta$ is obtained, not at
the unitarity, but slightly in the strong-coupling BEC side. This deviation is
consistent with the recent experiment on a $^6$Li Fermi gas. In the
weak-coupling BCS regime, we also find that $\eta$ exhibits anomalous
temperature dependence near $T_{\rm c}$, which is deeply related to the
pseudogap phenomenon originating form strong pairing fluctuations.

a few labeled data are available and large amounts of instances remain
unlabeled. Since AUC is an important model evaluation metric in classification,
directly optimizing AUC in semi-supervised learning scenario has drawn much
attention in the machine learning community. Recently, it has been shown that
one could find an unbiased solution for the semi-supervised AUC maximization
problem without knowing the class prior distribution. However, this method is
hardly scalable for nonlinear classification problems with kernels. To address
this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel scalable quadruply stochastic
gradient algorithm (QSG-S2AUC) for nonlinear semi-supervised AUC optimization.
In each iteration of the stochastic optimization process, our method randomly
samples a positive instance, a negative instance, an unlabeled instance and
their random features to compute the gradient and then update the model by
using this quadruply stochastic gradient to approach the optimal solution. More
importantly, we prove that QSG-S2AUC can converge to the optimal solution in
O(1/t), where t is the iteration number. Extensive experimental results on a
variety of benchmark datasets show that QSG-S2AUC is far more efficient than
the existing state-of-the-art algorithms for semi-supervised AUC maximization
while retaining the similar generalization performance.

signature of a long-range ordered magnetic ground state has been observed in

found as well in the magnetic data. Further confirmation of long-range magnetic
ordering comes from a sharp drop in the muon initial asymmetry and a peak in
the relaxation rate at 40 K, along with a weak anomaly near 36 K. Based on
temperature dependent NPD, the low temperature magnetic structure contains two
interpenetrating lattices of Dy and Ru5, forming an antiferromagnetic ground
state below 39.5 K with magnetic propagation vector k = (0,0,0). The magnetic
moments of Dy and Ru at 3.5 K are pointing along the crystallographic b-axis
with values of muDy = 4.92(10) muB and muRu = 1.94(7) muB, respectively. The
temperature dependence of the Ru moments follows a mean field type behaviour,
while that of the Dy moments exhibits a deviation indicating that the primary
magnetic ordering is induced by the order of the 4d electrons of Ru rather than
that of its proper 4f Dy electrons. The origin of the second anomaly observed
in the heat capacity data at 36.5 K must be connected to a very small spin
reorientation as the NPD studies do not reveal any clear change in the observed
magnetic Bragg peaks positions or intensities between these two transitions.
INS measurements reveal the presence of crystal field excitations (CEF) in the
paramagnetic state with overall CEF splitting of 73.8 meV, in agreement with

diagonal (in the occupation number basis) and off-diagonal elements of the
reduced density matrix are calculated for a square plaquette, which is embedded
in a much larger system of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, both at half

conservation, which allows to attach symmetry labels to its eigenvalues.
Knowledge of the probabilities of plaquette occupation number configurations is

of circumstellar material around main sequence stars, and looking for
exocometary events. The work concentrates on HR 10 (A2 IV/V), known for its
conspicuous variability in the circumstellar narrow absorption features of Ca
II K and other lines, so far interpreted as $\beta$ Pic-like phenomena, within
the falling evaporating body scenario. The main goal of this paper is to carry
out a thorough study of HR 10 to find the origin of the observed variability,
determine the nature of the star, its absolute parameters, and evolutionary
status. Interferometric near-infrared (NIR) observations, multi-epoch
high-resolution optical spectra spanning a time baseline of more than 32 years,
and optical and NIR photometry, together with theoretical modelling, were used
to tackle the above objectives. Our results reveal that HR 10 is a binary. The
narrow circumstellar absorption features superimposed on the photospheric Ca II
K lines -- and lines of other species -- can be decomposed into two or more
components, the two deep ones tracing the radial velocity of the individual
stars, which implies that their origin cannot be ascribed to transient
exocometary events, their variability being fully explained by the binarity of
the object. There does not appear to be transient events associated with
potential exocomets. Each individual star holds its own circumstellar shell and
there are no traces of a circumbinary envelope. The combined use of the
interferometric and radial velocity data leads to a complete spectrometric and
orbital solution for the binary, the main parameters being: an orbital period
of 747.6 days, eccentricities of the orbits around the centre of mass 0.25 (HR
10-A), 0.21 (HR 10-B) and a mass ratio of q=M$_{\rm B}$/M$_{\rm A}$=0.72-0.84.
The stars are slightly off the main sequence, the binary being $\sim530$ Myr
old.

  Given a value $\tilde{D} \leq D$ and $0 < \epsilon < 1$, we show that a

sensitive searches for heavy, thermally produced dark matter particles.
Recently, it has been shown, that non-thermally produced vector bosons
(sometimes called hidden photons) related to a broken U(1) gauge symmetry are
among the possible WISP (weakly interacting slim particles) dark matter
candidates. The WISP Dark Matter eXperiment (WISPDMX) is the first direct
hidden photon dark matter search experiment probing the particle masses within
the 0.8-2.07 $\mu$eV range with four resonant modes of a tunable radio
frequency cavity and down to 0.4 $n$eV outside of resonance. In this paper, we
present the results from the first science run of WISPDMX comprising 22000
broadband spectra with a 500 MHz bandwidth and a 50 Hz spectral resolution,
obtained during 10-second integrations made at each individual tuning step of
the measurements. No plausible dark matter candidate signal is found, both in
the individual spectra reaching minimum detectable power of $8^{-19}$ Watt and
in the averaged spectrum of all the measurements with the minimum detectable
power of $5^{-22}$ Watt attained for a total of 61 \hours of data taking. Using
these spectra, we derive upper limits on the coupling constant of the hidden
photon at the levels of $10^{e-13}$ for the resonant frequency ranges and
$10^{-12}$ for broadband mass range 0.2-2.07 $\mu$eV, and steadily increasing
at masses below 0.2$\mu$eV.

to physical cross sections, bypassing more traditional approaches. This
technique, the Four-Dimensional Unsubtraction (FDU), is based on the Loop-Tree
Duality (LTD) theorem, and aims at building pure four-dimensional
representations of scattering amplitudes at higher orders in perturbation
theory. This is done by locally renormalising the virtual contribution at high
energies, and then mapping the kinematics of the corresponding real
contribution so it matches the virtual one in the soft and collinear limits.
This makes the ultraviolet and infrared singularities vanish at the integrand
level when taking the sum of both contributions, meaning that the
four-dimensional limit can be taken before integrating, thus allowing for a
straightforward numerical implementation. We apply this method for the first
time to calculate the decay of a virtual photon to two massless quarks, and
then generalise the method to massive particles. We also show new advantages
provided by the LTD formalism. One of them is the possibility to write one- and
two-loop scattering amplitudes in a universal form at the integrand level,
regardless of the nature of the particle running inside the loop. The other is
to perform integrand-level asymptotic expansions in the internal mass - without
having to rely on expansion-by-region techniques - by taking advantage of the
Euclidean nature of the integration domain. Finally, we present a new algorithm
to locally renormalise two-loop amplitudes, where the renormalisation scheme
can be easily fixed through subleading contributions in the ultraviolet region.

to study the problem of inverse site percolation by the removal of $k \times k$
square tiles ($k^{2}$-mers) from square lattices. The process starts with an
initial configuration, where all lattice sites are occupied and, obviously, the
opposite sides of the lattice are connected by occupied sites. Then, the system
is diluted by removing $k^{2}$-mers of occupied sites from the lattice
following a random sequential adsorption mechanism. The process finishes when
the jamming state is reached and no more objects can be removed due to the
absence of occupied sites clusters of appropriate size and shape. The central
idea of this paper is based on finding the maximum concentration of occupied
sites, $p_{c,k}$, for which the connectivity disappears. This particular value
of the concentration is called \textit{inverse percolation threshold}, and
determines a well-defined geometrical phase transition in the system. The
results obtained for $p_{c,k}$ show that the inverse percolation threshold is a
decreasing function of $k$ in the range $1 \leq k \leq 4$. For $k \geq 5$, all
jammed configurations are percolating states, and consequently, there is no
non-percolating phase. In other words, the lattice remains connected even when
the highest allowed concentration of removed sites is reached. The jamming
exponent $\nu_j$ was measured, being $\nu_j = 1$ regardless of the size $k$
considered. In addition, the accurate determination of the critical exponents
$\nu$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ reveals that the percolation phase transition
involved in the system, which occurs for $k$ varying between 1 and 4, has the
same universality class as the standard percolation problem.

of research on the etiology of neurological disorders. However, manual
annotation of lesions can be challenging, time-consuming and subject to
observer bias. Automated detection methods often need voxel-wise annotations
for training. We propose a novel approach for automated lesion detection that
can be trained on scans only annotated with a dot per lesion instead of a full
segmentation. From the dot annotations and their corresponding intensity images
we compute various distance maps (DMs), indicating the distance to a lesion
based on spatial distance, intensity distance, or both. We train a fully
convolutional neural network (FCN) to predict these DMs for unseen intensity
images. The local optima in the predicted DMs are expected to correspond to
lesion locations. We show the potential of this approach to detect enlarged
perivascular spaces in white matter on a large brain MRI dataset with an
independent test set of 1000 scans. Our method matches the intra-rater
performance of the expert rater that was computed on an independent set. We
compare the different types of distance maps, showing that incorporating
intensity information in the distance maps used to train an FCN greatly
improves performance.

through a gravitational field has been used to place constraints on possible

obtain these constraints is not itself an observable in general relativity, but
is rather obtained by comparing with a fiducial Euclidean distance. There is
not a mapping between the constraints obtained in this manner and alternative
theories that exhibit equivalence principle violations. However, even assuming
that the comparison with the fiducial Euclidean distance is carried out in a
way that is useful for some class of alternative theories, we show that the
standard calculation of these constraints cannot be applied on cosmological
scales, as is often done. Specifically, we find that the Shapiro delay computed
in the standard way (taking the Newtonian potential to vanish at infinity)
diverges as one includes many remote sources. We use an infinite homogeneous
lattice model to illustrate this divergence, and also show how the divergence
can be cured by using Fermi coordinates associated with an observer. With this
correction, one finds that the Shapiro delay is no longer monotonic with the
number of sources. Thus, one cannot compute a conservative lower bound on the
Shapiro delay using a subset of the sources of the gravitational field without
further assumptions and/or observational input. As an illustration, we compute
the Shapiro delay by applying the Fermi coordinate expression to two catalogs
of galaxy clusters, illustrating the dependence of the result on the
completeness of the catalogue and the mass estimates.

essentially nonlinear (non-linearizable) nearest-neighbour coupling.
Combination of the damping and the substantially nonlinear coupling leads to
rather unusual two-stage pattern of the breather propagation. The first stage
occurs at finite fragment of the chain and is characterized by power-law decay
of the breather amplitude. The second stage is characterized by extremely small
breather amplitudes that decay hyper-exponentially with the site number. Thus,
practically, one can speak about finite penetration depth of the breather. This
phenomenon is referred to as breather arrest (BA). As particular example, we
explore the chain with Hertzian contacts. Dependencies of the breather
penetration depth on the initial excitation and on the damping coefficient on
the breather penetration depth obey power laws. The results are rationalized by
considering beating responses in a system of two damped linear oscillators with
strongly nonlinear (non-linearizable) coupling. Initial excitation of one of
these oscillators leads to strictly finite number of beating cycles. Then, the
beating cycle in this simplified system is associated with the passage of the
discrete breather between the neighbouring sites in the chain. Somewhat
surprisingly, this simplified model reliably predicts main quantitative
features of the breather arrest in the chain, including the exponents in
numerically observed power laws.

Hilbert spaces that consist only of genuinely multiparty entangled pure states.
They are natural generalizations of the well-known notion of completely
entangled subspaces , which by definition are void of fully product vectors.
Entangled subspaces are an important tool of quantum information theory as they
directly lead to constructions of entangled states, since any state supported
on such a subspace is automatically entangled. Moreover, they have also proven
useful in the area of quantum error correction. In our recent contribution [M.
Demianowicz and R. Augusiak, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{98}, 012313 (2018)], we have
studied the notion of a GES qualitatively in relation to so--called
nonorthogonal unextendible product bases and provided a few constructions of
such subspaces. The main aim of the present work is to perform a quantitative
study of the entanglement properties of GESs. First, we show how one can
attempt to compute analytically the subspace entanglement, defined as the
entanglement of the least entangled vector from the subspace, of a GES and
illustrate our method by applying it to a new class of GESs. Second, we show
that certain semidefinite programming relaxations can be exploited to estimate
the entanglement of a GES and apply this observation to a few classes of GESs
revealing that in many cases the method provides the exact results. Finally, we
study the entanglement of certain states supported on GESs, which is compared
to the obtained values of the entanglement of the corresponding subspaces, and
find the white--noise robustness of several GESs. In our study we use the
(generalized) geometric measure as the quantifier of entanglement.

is a 2-component link with nonzero linking number, then the linking number
determines the minimal number of clasps amongst all C-complexes. In the case of

associated with such central engines, i.e., nebulae for repeating FRBs and
afterglows for non-repeating FRBs. In general, the energy spectrum and flux
density of the counterpart depend strongly on its size and total injected

persistent radio counterpart requires the average energy injection rate into
the nebula to be between $2.7\times10^{39}~{\rm erg/s}$ and
$1.5\times10^{44}~{\rm erg/s}$, and the minimum injected energy be
$6.0\times10^{47}~{\rm erg}$ in around $7$ yr. Consequently, we find that for

disfavored; (2) a rotation-powered NS central engine works when

subsets (called blocks) of a point-set with $v$ points such that every two
blocks intersect each other in $\lambda$ points (and $\lambda < v$ is a fixed
number) and there are at least two block sizes. A design $\mathcal{D}$ is
called a symmetric design, if every point of $\mathcal{D}$ has the same
replication number (or equivalently, all the blocks have the same size) and
every two blocks intersect each other in $\lambda$ points. The only known
construction of a Ryser design is via block complementation of a symmetric
design. Such a Ryser design is called a Ryser design of Type-1. This is the
ground for the Ryser-Woodall conjecture: ""every Ryser design is of Type-1"".
This long standing conjecture has been shown to be valid in many situations.
  Let $\mathcal{D}$ denote a Ryser design of order $v$, index $\lambda$ and
replication numbers $r_1,r_2$. Let $e_i$ denote the number of points of
$\mathcal{D}$ with replication number $r_i$ (with $i = 1, 2$). Call $A$ small
(respectively large) if $|A| < 2\lambda$ (respectively $|A| > 2\lambda$) and
average if $|A|=2\lambda$. Let $D$ denote the integer $e_1 - r_2$ and let
$\rho> 1$ denote the rational number $\dfrac{r_1-1}{r_2-1}$. Main results of
the present article are the following.
  For every block $A$, $r_1 \geq |A| \geq r_2$ (this improves an earlier known
inequality $|A| \geq r_2$).
  If there is no small block (respectively no large block) in $\mathcal{D}$,
then $D\leq -1$ (respectively $D\geq 0$).
  With an extra assumption $e_2 > e_1$ an earlier known upper bound on $v$ is
improved from a cubic to a quadratic in $\lambda$.
  It is also proved that if $v \leq \lambda^2+ \lambda + 1$ and if $\rho$
equals $\lambda$ or $\lambda - 1$, then $\mathcal{D}$ is of Type-1.
  Finally a Ryser design with $ 2^n + 1$ points is shown to be of Type-1.

the NFL phenomena in PrV$_2$Al$_{20}$ based on magnetoresistance (MR), magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat measurements. Upon entering the NFL regime, we
observe a universal scaling behavior expected for the quadrupolar Kondo lattice

effect in driving the NFL behavior. Deviations from this scaling relation occur
below $\sim 8$ K, accompanied by a sign change in the MR and a power-law
divergence in the specific heat. This anomalous low-temperature state points to
the presence of other mechanisms which are not included in the theory, such as
heavy fermion coherence or multipolar quantum critical fluctuations.

three-term representations for the magnetic field (background vacuum field,
field line bending and field compression) and velocity ($\vec E\times\vec B$
flow, field-aligned flow and fluid compression), which are amenable to
three-dimensional treatment. Once the representations are inserted into the MHD
equations, appropriate projection operators are applied to Faraday's law and
the Navier-Stokes equation to obtain a system of scalar equations that is
closed by the continuity and energy equations. If the background vacuum field
is sufficiently strong and the $\beta$ is low, MHD waves are approximately
separated by the three terms in the velocity representation, with each term
containing a specific wave. Thus, by setting the appropriate term to zero, we
eliminate fast magnetosonic waves, obtaining a reduced MHD model. We also show
that the other two velocity terms do not compress the magnetic field, which
allows us to set the field compression term to zero within the same reduced
model. Dropping also the field-aligned flow, a further simplified model is
obtained, leading to a fully consistent hierarchy of reduced and full MHD
models for 3D plasma configurations. Finally, we discuss the conservation
properties and derive the conditions under which the reduction approximation is
valid. We also show that by using an ordering approach, reduced MHD equations
similar to what we got from the ansatz approach can be obtained by means of a

agreement with a theoretical estimate based on the measured imperfections of
the experiment. Our protocol is applicable to other continuous variable systems
and, in contrast with previous implementations of QEC, can mitigate all logical
errors generated by a wide variety of noise processes, and open a way towards

super resolution (SISR) are mostly based on optimizing pixel and content wise
similarity between recovered and high-resolution (HR) images and do not benefit
from recognizability of semantic classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach using categorical information to tackle the SISR problem; we present a
decoder architecture able to extract and use semantic information to
super-resolve a given image by using multitask learning, simultaneously for
image super-resolution and semantic segmentation. To explore categorical
information during training, the proposed decoder only employs one shared deep
network for two task-specific output layers. At run-time only layers resulting
HR image are used and no segmentation label is required. Extensive perceptual
experiments and a user study on images randomly selected from COCO-Stuff
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and it outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods.

difficult because of their dimensionality and pattern complexity. Therefore,

this paper, we present FDive, a visual active learning system that helps to
create visually explorable relevance models, assisted by learning a
pattern-based similarity. We use a small set of user-provided labels to rank
similarity measures, consisting of feature descriptor and distance function
combinations, by their ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant data.
Based on the best-ranked similarity measure, the system calculates an
interactive Self-Organizing Map-based relevance model, which classifies data
according to the cluster affiliation. It also automatically prompts further
relevance feedback to improve its accuracy. Uncertain areas, especially near
the decision boundaries, are highlighted and can be refined by the user. We
evaluate our approach by comparison to state-of-the-art feature selection
techniques and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by a case study
classifying electron microscopy images of brain cells. The results show that
FDive enhances both the quality and understanding of relevance models and can
thus lead to new insights for brain research.

hashing methods have attracted considerable attention. Generally, compared with
shallow cross-modal hashing methods, deep cross-modal hashing methods can
achieve a more satisfactory performance by integrating feature learning and
hash codes optimizing into a same framework. However, most existing deep
cross-modal hashing methods either cannot learn a unified hash code for the two
correlated data-points of different modalities in a database instance or cannot
guide the learning of unified hash codes by the feedback of hashing function
learning procedure, to enhance the retrieval accuracy. To address the issues
above, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Deep Cross-Modal Hashing
with Hashing Functions and Unified Hash Codes Jointly Learning (DCHUC).
Specifically, by an iterative optimization algorithm, DCHUC jointly learns
unified hash codes for image-text pairs in a database and a pair of hash
functions for unseen query image-text pairs. With the iterative optimization
algorithm, the learned unified hash codes can be used to guide the hashing
function learning procedure; Meanwhile, the learned hashing functions can
feedback to guide the unified hash codes optimizing procedure. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.

apparent work of adhesion coming into contact is consistently lower than the
intrinsic work of adhesion for the materials, and that there is adhesion
hysteresis during separation, commonly explained by viscoelastic dissipation.
Still lacking is a quantitative experimentally validated link between adhesion
and measured topography. Here, we used in situ measurements of contact size to
investigate the adhesion behavior of soft elastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
hemispheres (modulus ranging from 0.7 to 10 MPa) on four different
polycrystalline diamond substrates with topography characterized across eight
orders of magnitude, including down to the \r{A}ngstr\""om-scale. The results
show that the reduction in apparent work of adhesion is equal to the energy
required to achieve conformal contact. Further, the energy loss during contact
and removal is equal to the product of intrinsic work of adhesion and the true
contact area. These findings provide a simple mechanism to quantitatively link
the widely-observed adhesion hysteresis to roughness rather than viscoelastic

have vertices of constant coordination number, making it possible to isolate
topological effects of quenched disorder from node-intrinsic coordination
number disorder. Using large-scale numerical simulations and
finite-size-scaling techniques, we are able to demonstrate that both systems
belong to their respective clean universality classes. Therefore, quenched
disorder introduced by the randomness of the lattice is irrelevant and does not
influence the character of the phase transitions. We report the critical points
of both models to considerable precision and, for the Ising model, also the

crucial to investigate the evolution of temporal networks as well as various
collective dynamics taking place in them. The temporal interaction patterns
have been described by a series of interaction events or event sequences, often
showing non-Poissonian or bursty nature. Such bursty event sequences can be
understood not only by heterogeneous interevent times (IETs) but also by
correlations between IETs. The heterogeneities of IETs have been extensively
studied in recent years, while the correlations between IETs are far from being
fully explored. In this Chapter, we introduce various measures for bursty time
series analysis, such as the IET distribution, the burstiness parameter, the
memory coefficient, the bursty train sizes, and the autocorrelation function,
to discuss the relation between those measures. Then we show that the
correlations between IETs can affect the speed of spreading taking place in
temporal networks. Finally, we discuss possible research topics regarding
bursty time series analysis for temporal networks.

interferometric radio telescope operating at $200-1100\,\mathrm{MHz}$. Its
design is driven by six science goals which span three science themes: the
physics of dark energy (measuring the expansion history and growth of the
universe up to $z=6$), the physics of inflation (constraining primordial
non-Gaussianity and primordial features) and the transient radio sky (detecting
one million fast radio bursts and following up SKA-discovered pulsars). We
propose two array configurations composed of hexagonally close-packed 6m dish
arrangements with 50% fill factor. The initial 5,000 element 'petite array' is
scientifically compelling, and can act as a demonstrator and a stepping stone
to the full 32,000 element 'full array'. Viewed as a 21cm intensity mapping
telescope, the program has the noise equivalent of a traditional spectroscopic
galaxy survey comprised of 0.6 and 2.5 billion galaxies at a comoving
wavenumber of $k=0.5\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ spanning the redshift range $z = 0.3
- 6$ for the petite and full configurations, respectively. At redshifts beyond
$z=2$, the 21cm technique is a uniquely powerful way of mapping the universe,
while the low-redshift range will allow for numerous cross-correlations with
existing and upcoming surveys. This program is enabled by the development of
ultra-wideband radio feeds, cost-effective dish construction methods, commodity
radio-frequency electronics driven by the telecommunication industry and the
emergence of sufficient computing power to facilitate real-time signal
processing that exploits the full potential of massive radio arrays. The
project has an estimated construction cost of 55 and 330 million FY19 USD for
the petite and full array configurations. Including R&D, design, operations and
science analysis, the cost rises to 125 and 600 million FY19 USD, respectively.

offer a plethora of techniques to optimize designs for both area and
performance, but resource usage and timing reports of HLS tools mostly deviate
from the post-implementation results. In addition, to evaluate a hardware
design performance, it is critical to determine the maximum achievable clock
frequency. Obtaining such information using static timing analysis provided by
CAD tools is difficult, due to the multitude of tool options. Moreover, a
binary search to find the maximum frequency is tedious, time-consuming, and
often does not obtain the optimal result. To address these challenges, we
propose a framework, called Pyramid, that uses machine learning to accurately
estimate the optimal performance and resource utilization of an HLS design. For
this purpose, we first create a database of C-to-FPGA results from a diverse

Minerva, which is an automated hardware optimization tool. Minerva determines
the close-to-optimal settings of tools, using static timing analysis and a
heuristic algorithm, and targets either optimal throughput or
throughput-to-area. Pyramid uses the database to train an ensemble machine
learning model to map the HLS-reported features to the results of Minerva. To
this end, Pyramid re-calibrates the results of HLS to bridge the accuracy gap
and enable developers to estimate the throughput or throughput-to-area of
hardware design with more than 95% accuracy and alleviates the need to perform
actual implementation for estimation.

three-dimensional objects from a computer-aided design model by successively
adding material layer by layer. AM has become very popular in the past decade
due to its utility for fast prototyping such as 3D printing as well as
manufacturing functional parts with complex geometries using processes such as
laser metal deposition that would be difficult to create using traditional
machining. As the process for creating an intricate part for an expensive metal
such as Titanium is prohibitive with respect to cost, computational models are
used to simulate the behavior of AM processes before the experimental run.
However, as the simulations are computationally costly and time-consuming for
predicting multiscale multi-physics phenomena in AM, physics-informed
data-driven machine-learning systems for predicting the behavior of AM
processes are immensely beneficial. Such models accelerate not only multiscale
simulation tools but also empower real-time control systems using in-situ data.
In this paper, we design and develop essential components of a scientific
framework for developing a data-driven model-based real-time control system.
Finite element methods are employed for solving time-dependent heat equations
and developing the database. The proposed framework uses extremely randomized
trees - an ensemble of bagged decision trees as the regression algorithm
iteratively using temperatures of prior voxels and laser information as inputs
to predict temperatures of subsequent voxels. The models achieve mean absolute
percentage errors below 1% for predicting temperature profiles for AM

end-to-end deep learning framework for fingerprint recognition using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which can jointly learn the feature
representation and perform recognition. We train our model on a large-scale
fingerprint recognition dataset, and improve over previous approaches in terms
of accuracy. Our proposed model is able to achieve a very high recognition
accuracy on a well-known fingerprint dataset. We believe this framework can be
widely used for biometrics recognition tasks, making more scalable and accurate
systems possible. We have also used a visualization technique to highlight the
important areas in an input fingerprint image, that mostly impact the

strategy essentially relies on various structural characterizations and
dilation properties associated with Lamperti operators, which are of
independent interest. More precisely, we give a structural description of
Lamperti operators in the noncommutative setting, and obtain a simultaneous
dilation theorem for Lamperti contractions. As a consequence we establish the
maximal ergodic theorem for the strong closure of the convex hull of

newly-built structural theorem, we also obtain the maximal ergodic inequalities
for positive power bounded doubly Lamperti operators.
  We also observe that the concrete examples of positive contractions without
Akcoglu's dilation, which were constructed by Junge-Le Merdy, still satisfy the
maximal ergodic inequalities. We also discuss some other examples, showing
sharp contrast to the classical situation.

population consisting of drug users and non-users has been proposed. The model
describes the dynamics of non-users, experimental users, recreational users,
and addict users within a population. The aim of this work is to propose a
modified version of this model by analogy with the classical predator-prey
models, in particular considering non-users as prey and users as predator.
Hence, our model includes a stabilizing effect of the growth rate of the prey,
and a destabilizing effect of the predator saturation. Functional responses of
Verhulst and of Holling type II have been used for modeling these effects. To
forecast the marijuana consumption in the states of Colorado and Washington, we
used data from Hanley (2013) and a genetic algorithm to calibrate the
parameters in our model. Assuming that the population of non-users increases in
proportion with the demography, and following the seminal works of Sir Robert
May (1976), we use the growth rate of non-users as the main bifurcation
parameter. For the state of Colorado, the model first exhibits a limit cycle,
which agrees quite accurately with the reported periodic data in Hanley (2013).
By further increasing the growth rate of non-users, the population then enters
into two chaotic regions, within which the evolution of the variables becomes
unpredictable. For the state of Washington, the model also exhibits a periodic
solution, which is again in good agreement with observed data. A chaotic region
for Washington is likewise observed in the bifurcation diagram. Our research
confirms that mathematical models can be a useful tool for better understanding
illicit drug consumption, and for guiding policy-makers towards more effective
policies to contain this epidemic.

to explore the effects of the unknown high energy physics in the single scalar
field inflation models. For a generic EFT of inflation, possible high energy
corrections to simple slow-roll inflation can modify both the propagating speed
and dispersion relations of the cosmological scalar and tensor perturbations.
With the arrival of the era of precision cosmology, it is expected that these
high energy corrections become more important and have to be taken into account
in the analysis with future precise observational data. In this paper we study
the observational predictions of the EFT of inflation by using the third-order
uniform asymptotic approximation method. We calculate explicitly the primordial
power spectra, spectral indices, running of the spectral indices for both
scalar and tensor perturbations, and the ratio between tensor and scalar
spectra. These expressions are all written in terms of the Hubble flow
parameters and the flow of four new slow-roll parameters and expanded up to the
next-to-leading order in the slow-roll expansions so they represent the most
accurate results obtained so far in the literature. The flow of the four new
slow-roll parameters, which arise from the four new operators introduced in the
action of the EFT of inflation, can affect the primordial perturbation spectra
at the leading-order and the corresponding spectral indices at the

a partial order on states. The expressive power of partially ordered automata
is closely related to the expressivity of fragments of first-order logic on
finite words or, equivalently, to the language classes of the levels of the
Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy. Several fragments (levels) have been intensively
investigated under various names. For instance, the fragment of first-order
formulae with a single existential block of quantifiers in prenex normal form
is known as piecewise testable languages or $J$-trivial languages. These
languages are characterized by confluent partially ordered DFAs or by complete,
confluent, and self-loop-deterministic partially ordered NFAs (ptNFAs for
short). In this paper, we study the complexity of basic questions for several
types of partially ordered automata on finite words; namely, the questions of
inclusion, equivalence, and ($k$-)piecewise testability. The lower-bound
complexity boils down to the complexity of universality. The universality
problem asks whether a system recognizes all words over its alphabet. For
ptNFAs, the complexity of universality decreases if the alphabet is fixed, but
it is open if the alphabet may grow with the number of states. We show that
deciding universality for general ptNFAs is as hard as for general NFAs. Our
proof is a novel and nontrivial extension of our recent construction for
self-loop-deterministic partially ordered NFAs, a model strictly more
expressive than ptNFAs. We provide a comprehensive picture of the complexities
of the problems of inclusion, equivalence, and ($k$-)piecewise testability for
the considered types of automata.

critical state based on the size distribution of network-wide avalanches of
activity. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of selecting
appropriate parameters in the evaluation of the size distribution and indicate
that it is possible to perturb networks showing highly synchronized---or
supercritical---behavior into the critical state by increasing the level of
inhibition in the network. The classification of critical versus non-critical
networks is valuable in identifying networks that can be expected to perform
well on computational tasks, as criticality is widely considered to be the
state in which a system is best suited for computation. This type of analysis
is expected to enable the identification of networks that are well-suited for
computation and the classification of networks as perturbed or healthy. This
study is part of a larger research project, the overarching aim of which is to
develop computational models that are able to reproduce target behaviors
observed in in vitro neuronal networks. These models will ultimately be used to
aid in the realization of these behaviors in nanomagnet arrays to be used in

physics and beyond, but in most cases studied to date resetting to the origin
was assumed to take zero time or a time decoupled from the spatial position at
the resetting moment. However, in our world, getting from one place to another
always takes time and places that are further away take more time to be
reached. We thus set off to extend the theory of stochastic resetting such that
it would account for this inherent spatio-temporal coupling. We consider a
particle that starts at the origin and follows a certain law of stochastic
motion until it is interrupted at some random time. The particle then returns
to the origin via a prescribed protocol. We study this model and surprisingly
discover that the shape of the steady-state distribution which governs the
stochastic motion phase does not depend on the return protocol. This shape
invariance then gives rise to a simple, and generic, recipe for the computation
of the full steady-state distribution. Several case studies are analyzed and a
class of processes whose steady-state is completely invariant with respect to
the speed of return is highlighted. For processes in this class we recover the
same steady-state obtained for resetting with instantaneous
returns---irrespective of whether the actual return speed is high or low. Our
work significantly extends previous results on motion with stochastic resetting
and is expected to find various applications in statistical, chemical, and
biological physics.

spacetime (gravity) as a physical quantum system plays a central role for
formulating the theory, and (2) there are no any classical systems and
concepts. Here universal spacetime-matter entanglement ""glues"" spacetime and
matter (matter fermions and their gauge fields) as an indivisible trinity,
encodes information-complete physical predictions of the world, and is as
universal as universal gravitation. After summarizing the basic theoretic
structure of the ICQT, conceptual advances achieved so far and some new issues
within the ICQT are considered. While such a theory integrating quantum gravity
is of fundamental interest to a wider audience, its relevance to quantum
information technologies is discussed, with emphasis on its potential impacts
on quantum computing and quantum communication.

and negative information regarding the behaviour of a previous participant in a
dictator game with a taking option. We use the strategy method to identify
behavioural ""types"", and thus distinguish ""conformists"" from
""counter-conformists"", and unconditional choosers. Unconditional choosers make
up the greatest proportion of types (about 80%) while only about 20% of
subjects condition their responses to social information. We find that both
conformity and counter-conformity are driven by a desire to be seen as moral
(the ""symbolization"" dimension of moral identity). The main difference is that,
conformity is also driven by a sensitivity to what others think (""attention to
social comparison""). Unconditional giving (about 30% of players) on the other
hand is mainly driven by the centrality of moral identity to the self (the
""internalization"" dimension of moral identity). Social information thus seems
to mainly affect those who care about being seen to be moral. The direction of
effect however depends on how sensitive one is to what others think.

Thus, while using numerical methods, these time series have been anonymously
analyzed. Nevertheless, because of the stochastic inputs induced by daily
activities of any human being, it has not been possible to discriminate chaos
from noise. So, we have decided to keep only the 14 nights of these ten

according to the delay coordinate embedding method has allowed us to estimate
for each patient the correlation dimension and the maximal Lyapunov exponent.
This has led us to show that type 1 diabetes could indeed be a chaotic
phenomenon. Once this result has been confirmed by the determinism test, we
have computed the Lyapunov time and found that the limit of predictability of

proposes jumps between contours and has an efficiency that degrades very slowly

not terminally affected by unbounded gradients of the log-posterior. We test
Hug and Hop empirically on a variety of toy targets and real statistical models

wavenumber exist in the homogeneous media. Optical BICs are of significant
current interest, since they have applications in lasing, sensing, filtering,
switching, and many light emission processes, but they cannot be excited by
incident plane waves when the structure consists of linear materials. In this
paper, we study the diffraction of a plane wave by a periodic structure with a
second order nonlinearity, assuming the structure has a BIC and the frequency
and wavenumber of the incident wave are one half of those of the BIC. Based on
a scaling analysis and a perturbation theory, we show that the incident wave
may induce a very strong second harmonic wave dominated by the BIC, and also a
fourth harmonic wave that cannot be ignored. The perturbation theory reveals
that the amplitude of the BIC is inversely proportional to a small parameter
depending on the amplitude of the incident wave and the nonlinear coefficient.
In addition, a system of four nonlinearly coupled Helmholtz equations (the
four-wave model) is proposed to model the nonlinear process. Numerical
solutions of the four-wave model are presented for a periodic array of circular
cylinders and used to validate the perturbation results.

for reconstructions include generalized sampling and its compressed versions,
as well as recent methods based on data assimilation. Common to these methods
is that the reconstruction quality depends highly on the subspace angle between
the sampling and the reconstruction space, which is dictated by the stable
sampling rate. As a result of the theory provided in this paper, these methods
can now easily use binary measurements and wavelet reconstruction bases.

continuous structure against a rigid distributed obstacle. Galerkin's approach
is used to approximate the solutions of the governing partial differential
equations of the structure, which results in a system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). When these ODEs are subjected to unilateral constraints and
velocity jump conditions, one must use an event detection algorithm to
calculate the time of impact accurately. Event detection in the presence of
multiple simultaneous impacts is a computationally demanding task. Ivanov
proposed a nonsmooth transformation for a vibro-impacting
multi-degree-of-freedom system subjected to a single unilateral constraint.
This transformation eliminates the unilateral constraints from the problem and,
therefore, no event detection is required during numerical integration. Ivanov
used his transformation to make analytical calculations for the stability and
bifurcations of vibro-impacting motions; however, he did not explore its
application for simulating distributed collisions in spatially continuous
structures. We adopt Ivanov's transformation to deal with multiple unilateral
constraints in spatially continuous structures. Also, imposing the velocity
jump conditions exactly in the modal coordinates is nontrivial and challenging.
Therefore, in this work we use a modal-physical transformation to convert the
system from modal to physical coordinates on a spatially discretized grid. We
then apply Ivanov's transformation on the physical system to simulate the
vibro-impact motion of the structure. The developed method is demonstrated by
modeling the distributed collision of a nonlinear string against a rigid
distributed surface. For validation, we compare our results with the well-known
penalty approach.

this is a challenge to their practical usage in control strategies under
production conditions. We address this task by means of adaptive neural
networks, which re-adjust their weights when transferred to new conditions.
Such an adaptive account for computational models is typical of the field of
developmental robotics, which investigates learning of motor control in
artificial systems inspired on infants development. Similarly to robots,
greenhouses are complex systems comprising technical and biological elements,
whose state can be measured and modified through control actions. We present an
adaptive model architecture to perform online learning on greenhouse models.
This learning process makes use of an episodic memory and of online
re-training. This allows for adaptation without the need for a complete new
training, which might be prohibitive if the data under the new conditions is
scarce. Current experiments focus on how a model of tomato photosynthesis,
developed in a research facility, can adapt itself to a new environment in a
production greenhouse. Further research will focus on model plasticity by means
of adaptive learning rates and management of the episodic memory described in
this paper. The models presented as a proof-of-concept estimate the
transpiration and photosynthesis of a hydroponic tomato crop by using
measurements of the climate as inputs. The models are trained and tested using
data from a greenhouse in Berlin, Germany. Thereafter, the adaptive
architecture is fed with data from a production greenhouse in southern Germany,
where other tomato varieties were grown under different irrigation and climate
strategies. The proposed adaptive architecture represents a promising tool for
spreading the use of models produced by high-tech research centers to the
greenhouse production sector.

existing approaches have not been adapted to the healthcare domain due to a
lack of healthcare Question-to-SQL dataset for learning models specific to this

typos in questions introduce additional challenges for accurately generating
the corresponding SQL queries. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by
developing a deep learning based TRanslate-Edit Model for Question-to-SQL

directly generate the SQL query for a given question, and further performs the
