different social groups can hold different norms, and lacking an overarching

paper, we present an agent-based model that simulates the adoption of norms in
two interacting groups. We explore this phenomenon while varying relative group
sizes and homophily/heterophily (two features of network structure), and
initial group norm distributions. Agents update their norm according to an
adapted version of Granovetter's threshold model, using a uniform distribution
of thresholds. We study the impact of network structure and initial norm
distributions on the process of achieving normative consensus and the resulting
potential for intragroup and intergroup conflict. Our results show that norm
change is most likely when norms are strongly tied to group membership. Groups
end up with the most similar norm distributions when networks are heterophilic,
with small to middling minority groups. High homophilic networks show high
potential intergroup conflict and low potential intragroup conflict, while the
opposite pattern emerges for high heterophilic networks.

the localization of the underlying driving sources on arbitrary graphs by
observing a significantly smaller subset of vertices of the graph uniformly in
time. Specifically, we focus on the heat diffusion equation driven by an
initial field and an external time-invariant input. When the underlying driving
sources are modeled as an initial field or external input, the sources (hence
the diffusive field) can be recovered from the subsampled observations without
imposing any band-limiting or sparsity constraints. When the diffusion is
induced by both the initial field and external input, then the field and
sources can be recovered from the subsampled observations, however, by imposing
band-limiting constraints on either the initial field or external input. For
heat diffusion on graphs, we can compensate for the unobserved vertices with
the temporal samples at the observed vertices. If the observations are
noiseless, then the recovery is exact. Nonetheless, the developed least squares
estimators perform reasonably well with noisy observations. We apply the
developed theory for localizing and recovering hot spots on a rectangular metal

However, most of the existing maintenance models focus on single-component
systems and are not applicable for complex systems consisting of multiple

maintenance optimization problem, which joins the stochastic processes
regarding the failures of the components with the combinatorial problems
regarding the grouping of maintenance activities, is challenging in both
modeling and solution techniques, and has remained as an open issue in the
literature. In this paper, we study the multi-component maintenance problem
over a finite planning horizon and formulate the problem as a multi-stage
stochastic integer program with decision-dependent uncertainty. There is a lack
of general efficient methods to solve this type of problem. To address this
challenge, we use an alternative approach to model the underlying failure
process and develop a novel two-stage model without decision-dependent
uncertainty. Structural properties of the two-stage problem are investigated,
and a progressive-hedging-based heuristic is developed based on the structural
properties. Our heuristic algorithm demonstrates a significantly improved
capacity in handling practically large-size two-stage problems comparing to
three conventional methods for stochastic integer programming, and solving the
two-stage model by our heuristic in a rolling horizon provides a good
approximation of the multi-stage problem. The heuristic is further benchmarked
with a dynamic programming approach commonly adopted in the literature.
Numerical results show that our heuristic can lead to significant cost savings
compared with the benchmark approach.

concerns ERC20's defined method approve() which was envisioned as a way for
token holders to give permission for other users and dapps to withdraw a capped
number of tokens. The security issue arises when a token holder wants to adjust
the amount of approved tokens from N to M (this could be an increase or

front-run the adjustment transaction to first withdraw N tokens, then allow the
approval to be confirmed, and withdraw an additional M tokens. In this paper,

the down-shift of the pz band caused by the bilayer band folding in this

segmented scintillator counters like the MEG II pixelated Timing Counter (pTC),
consisting of 512-centimeter scale scintillator counters read out by silicon
photomultipliers (SiPMs). It is difficult to apply previous laser-based
calibration methods for conventional meter-scale Time-Of-Flight detectors to
the MEG II pTC from the implementation and the accuracy points of view. This
paper presents a new laser-based time calibration system which can overcome
such difficulties. A laser pulse is split into each scintillator counter via
several optical components so that we can directly measure the time offset of
each counter relative to the laser-emitted time. We carefully tested all the
components and procedures prior to the actual operation. The laser system was
installed into the pTC and thoroughly tested under the real experimental
condition. The system showed good stability and being sensitive to any change
of timing larger than ~10 ps. Moreover, it showed an uncertainty of 48 ps in
the determination of the time offsets, which meets our requirements. The new
method provides an example of the implementation of a precise timing alignment
for the new type of detectors enabled by the advance of SiPM technology.

  Lie Theory","12 pages, including 2 figures. v2 has corrected various minor typos",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A local resolution of the Problem of Time has recently been given, alongside
reformulation as a local theory of Background Independence. The classical part
of this requires just Lie's Mathematics, much of which is basic: i) Lie
derivatives to encode Relationalism. ii) Lie brackets for Closure giving Lie
algebraic structures. iii) Observables defined by a Lie brackets relation, in
the constrained canonical case as explicit PDEs to be solved using Lie's flow
method, and themselves forming Lie algebras. iv) Lattices of constraint
algebraic substructures induce dual lattices of observables subalgebras.
  The current Article focuses on two pieces of `higher Lie Theory' that are
also required. Preliminarily, we extend Dirac's Algorithm for Constraint
Closure to `Lie's Algorithm' for Generator Closure. 1) We then reinterpret
`passing families of theories through the Dirac Algorithm' - a method used for
Spacetime Construction (from space) and getting more structure from less
structure assumed more generally - as the Dirac Rigidity subcase of Lie
Rigidity. We also provide a Foundations of Geometry example of specifically Lie
rather than Dirac Rigidity, to illustrate merit in extending from Dirac to Lie
Algorithms. We point to such rigidity providing a partial cohomological (and
thus global) selection principle for the Comparative Theory of Background
Independence. 2) We finally pose the universal (theory-independent) analogue of
GR's Refoliation Invariance for the general Lie Theory: Reallocation of
Intermediary-Object Invariance. This is a commuting pentagon criterion: in
evolving from an initial object to a final object, does switching which
intermediary object one proceeds via amount to at most a difference by an
automorphism of the final object? We argue for this to also be a selection
principle in the Comparative Theory of Background Independence.

cases of the transformation can be interpreted as a reversed companion
linearization for polynomial eigenvalue problems, as well as a reversed (less
known) linearization technique for certain algebraic eigenvalue problems with
square-root terms. Moreover, by exploiting the structure of the NEP we present
algorithm specializations for NEP methods, although the technique also allows
general solution methods for NEPs to be directly applied. The nonlinearization
is illustrated in examples and simulations, with focus on problems where the
eliminated equation is of much smaller size than the other two-parameter

determines the tidal equilibrium states for this class of extrasolar planetary
systems. We start by considering two planet systems with fixed orbital spacing
and variable mass ratios. The basic conjecture explored in this paper is that
the planet formation process will act to distribute planetary masses in order
to achieve a minimum energy state. The resulting minimum energy configuration
--- subject to the constraint of constant angular momentum --- corresponds to
circular orbits confined to a plane, with nearly equal planetary masses (as
observed). We then generalize the treatment to include multiple planet systems,
where each adjacent pair of planets attains its (local) tidal equilibrium
state. The properties of observed planetary systems are close to those expected
from this pairwise equilibrium configuration. In contrast, observed systems do
not reside in a global minimum energy state. Both the equilibrium states of
this paper and observed multi-planet systems, with planets of nearly equal mass
on regularly spaced orbits, have an effective surface density of the form
$\sigma\propto r^{-2}$, much steeper than most disk models.

currently define the state-of-the-art. Here, we propose a new map-based

This delivers a new independent map-based observable, the electron temperature

that PICO has the required sensitivity, resolution, and frequency coverage to

$\nu\gtrsim 300\,{\rm GHz}$ plays an important role for extracting the
relativistic SZ effect in the presence of foregrounds. For Coma, PICO will
allow us to directly reconstruct the electron temperature profile using the

thermodynamic origin of U-Nb's discontinuous precipitation hypothesized that
the energy of $\alpha$ forms an intermediate common tangent with the first
potential of the double-well energy of $\gamma$ at the $\gamma'$ composition.
While this hypothesis is eligible and consistent with the experimental
observation of gradual increase in $\gamma'$ composition at increasing
temperature, it is in conflict with recent experiments whose results indicated
a distribution of $\gamma'$ compositions in the vicinity of 50 at\%Nb. To shed
some light onto this issue, the current work investigates the origin of U-Nb's
discontinuous precipitation in view of fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics,
taken from the perspective of phase-field theory. It has been showed that local

Pure lexical matching via an inverted index falls short in this respect due to
several factors: a) lack of understanding of hypernyms, synonyms, and antonyms,
b) fragility to morphological variants (e.g. ""woman"" vs. ""women""), and c)
sensitivity to spelling errors. To address these issues, we train a deep
learning model for semantic matching using customer behavior data. Much of the
recent work on large-scale semantic search using deep learning focuses on
ranking for web search. In contrast, semantic matching for product search
presents several novel challenges, which we elucidate in this paper. We address
these challenges by a) developing a new loss function that has an inbuilt
threshold to differentiate between random negative examples, impressed but not
purchased examples, and positive examples (purchased items), b) using average
pooling in conjunction with n-grams to capture short-range linguistic patterns,
c) using hashing to handle out of vocabulary tokens, and d) using a model

confirming the black hole nature of the compact object. Our analysis of the
stellar absorption features supports a K3-5 spectral classification for the
donor star, which contributes 20% of the total flux at 5200-6800 Angs. The
photometric 0.703 +/- 0.003 d periodicity observed during outburst is 2.6%
longer than the orbital period supporting the presence of a superhump
modulation in the outburst lightcurves. In line with this interpretation, we
constrain the binary mass ratio to be q=0.12. In addition, we observe a sharp
increase in the Halpha emission line equivalent width during inferior
conjunction of the donor star that we interpret as a grazing eclipse of the
accretion disc and allows us to constrain the binary inclination to > 69 deg.
On the other hand, the absence of X-ray eclipses during outburst imply i < 77
deg. These inclination limits, together with our dynamical solution, lead to a
black hole mass in the range 7-8 Msun. We also measure a systemic velocity =

importance to elucidate cellular functions. However, it is challenging to
obtain high quality images of different structures directly due to complex
cellular environments. Fluorescence staining is a popular technique to label
different structures but has several drawbacks. In particular, label staining
is time consuming and may affect cell morphology, and simultaneous labels are
inherently limited. This raises the need of building computational models to
learn relationships between unlabeled microscopy images and labeled
fluorescence images, and to infer fluorescence labels of other microscopy
images excluding the physical staining process. We propose to develop a novel
deep model for virtual staining of unlabeled microscopy images. We first
propose a novel network layer, known as the global pixel transformer layer,
that fuses global information from inputs effectively. The proposed global
pixel transformer layer can generate outputs with arbitrary dimensions, and can
be employed for all the regular, down-sampling, and up-sampling operators. We
then incorporate our proposed global pixel transformer layers and dense blocks
to build an U-Net like network. We believe such a design can promote feature
reusing between layers. In addition, we propose a multi-scale input strategy to
encourage networks to capture features at different scales. We conduct
evaluations across various fluorescence image prediction tasks to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Both quantitative and qualitative results
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach significantly.
It is also shown that our proposed global pixel transformer layer is useful to
improve the fluorescence image prediction results.

10,158, age range 18 - 97) of structural brain MRIs in a healthy population
from multiple publicly-available sources, upon which we train a deep learning
model for brain age estimation. The availability of the large-scale dataset
enables a more uniform age distribution across adult life-span for effective
age estimation with no bias toward certain age groups. We demonstrate that the
age estimation accuracy, evaluated with mean absolute error (MAE) and
correlation coefficient (r), outperforms previously reported methods in both a
hold-out test set reflective of the custom population (MAE = 4.06 years, r =
0.970) and an independent life-span evaluation dataset (MAE = 4.21 years, r =
0.960) on which a previous study has evaluated. We further demonstrate the
utility of the estimated age in life-span aging analysis of cognitive
functions. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation tests and employ
feature-attribution techniques to analyze which regions contribute the most
predictive value, demonstrating the prominence of the frontal lobe as well as
pattern shift across life-span. In summary, we achieve superior age estimation
performance confirming the efficacy of deep learning and the added utility of
training with data both in larger number and more uniformly distributed than in

(flat) bands piercing dispersive (steep) bands can give rise to strongly
correlated phenomena, and are associated with unconventional superconductivity.
It is known that in twisted trilayer graphene steep Dirac cones can coexist
with band flattening, but the phenomenon is not stable under layer
misalignments. Here we show that such a twisted sandwiched graphene (TSWG) -- a
three-layer van der Waals heterostructure with a twisted middle layer -- can
have very stable flat bands coexisting with Dirac cones near the Fermi energy
when twisted to 1.5 degrees. These flat bands require a specific high-symmetry
stacking order, and our atomistic calculations predict that TSWG always relaxes
to it. Additionally, with external fields, we can control the relative energy
offset between the Dirac cone vertex and the flat bands. Our work establishes
twisted sandwiched graphene as a new platform for research into strongly
interacting phases, and topological transport beyond Dirac and Weyl semimetals.

  Latent Variable Model","Project website: https://alexlee-gk.github.io/slac/",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can use high-capacity deep
networks to learn directly from image observations. However, these
high-dimensional observation spaces present a number of challenges in practice,
since the policy must now solve two problems: representation learning and task
learning. In this work, we tackle these two problems separately, by explicitly
learning latent representations that can accelerate reinforcement learning from
images. We propose the stochastic latent actor-critic (SLAC) algorithm: a
sample-efficient and high-performing RL algorithm for learning policies for
complex continuous control tasks directly from high-dimensional image inputs.
SLAC provides a novel and principled approach for unifying stochastic
sequential models and RL into a single method, by learning a compact latent
representation and then performing RL in the model's learned latent space. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms both
model-free and model-based alternatives in terms of final performance and
sample efficiency, on a range of difficult image-based control tasks. Our code
and videos of our results are available at our website.

well known as the near horizon geometry equation. The second constraint we find
is new. The constraints lead to a complete characterization of those NE-SF null

environment with a swarm of asynchronous, frequently-crashing autonomous mobile
robots. We represent the environment by a discrete graph, and task the robots
with occupying every vertex and with constructing an implicit distributed
spanning tree of the graph. The robotic agents activate independently at random
exponential waiting times of mean $1$ and enter the graph environment over time
from a source location. They grow the environment's coverage by 'settling' at
empty locations and aiding other robots' navigation from these locations. The
robots are identical and make decisions driven by the same simple and local
rule of behaviour. The local rule is based only on the presence of neighbouring
robots, and on whether a settled robot points to the current location. Whenever
a robot moves, it may crash and disappear from the environment. Each vertex in
the environment has limited physical space, so robots frequently obstruct each
other.
  Our goal is to show that even under conditions of asynchronicity, frequent
crashing, and limited physical space, the simple mobile robots complete their
mission in linear time asymptotically almost surely, and time to completion
degrades gracefully with the frequency of the crashes. Our model and analysis
are based on the well-studied ""totally asymmetric simple exclusion process"" in
statistical mechanics.

all-electrical fully functional devices, inspired by their fascinating physical

experimentally demonstrate such a device: electrically-operating skyrmion-based
artificial synaptic device designed for neuromorphic computing. We present that
controlled current-induced creation, motion, detection and deletion of
skyrmions in ferrimagnetic multilayers can be harnessed in a single device at
room temperature to imitate the behaviors of biological synapses. Using
simulations, we demonstrate that such skyrmion-based synapses could be used to
perform neuromorphic pattern-recognition computing using handwritten
recognition data set, reaching to the accuracy of ~89 percents, comparable to
the software-based training accuracy of ~94 percents. Chip-level simulation
then highlights the potential of skyrmion synapse compared to existing

skyrmion-based fully functional electronic devices while providing a new

shared convolutional kernel parameters, hence drastically decreasing the search

settings (~80ms). In particular, we enhance the accuracy-runtime trade-off in
differentiable NAS by treating the Squeeze-and-Excitation path as a fully

overall cost of only 8 epochs (24 TPU-hours), which is up to 5,000x faster

generated by the thermal bias are caused by different transport processes,
where electron cotunneling is responsible for the heat flow to the cold lead

spin-polarized Cooper pairs at the superconductors, generating a supercurrent
that can be switched on/off by tuning their relative phase. We further
demonstrate that signatures of spin-triplet pairing are facilitated by rather
low fluctuations of the thermoelectric current for temperature gradients

(DSA) theory is a commonly adopted scenario to explain the origin of cosmic

galaxies occurs at high redshifts ($z > 3$) rather than at low redshifts ($z <
1$), as is commonly thought. We find, using isolated non-cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations, that highly overdense protoclusters assemble their
stellar mass into brightest cluster galaxies within $\sim 1$ $\mathrm{Gyr}$ of
evolution -- producing massive blue elliptical galaxies at high redshifts ($z
\gtrsim 1.5$). We argue that there is a downsizing effect on the cluster scale
wherein some of the brightest cluster galaxies in the cores of the most-massive
clusters assemble earlier than those in lower-mass clusters. In those clusters
with $z = 0$ virial mass $\geqslant 5\times10^{14}$ M$_\mathrm{\odot}$, we find
that $9.8$% have their cores assembly early, and a higher fraction of $16.4$%
in those clusters above $10^{15}$ M$_\mathrm{\odot}$. The James Webb Space
Telescope will be able to detect and confirm our prediction in the near future,
and we discuss the implications to constraining the value of
$\sigma_\mathrm{8}$.

$\mu$m emission increases. Remarkably, the optical colors of the Galactic cirri
differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources, with a characteristic
bluer r-i color for a given g-r, allowing one to detect these by using a simple
color relation. Our results show the high potential of deep multi-band optical
photometry, on its own, identifying the presence of cirri at a higher spatial
resolution than those provided by far-infrared observations. The combination of
very deep data and multi-band photometry (as the one produced by LSST and

supermassive black hole. We fitted the spectrum of these sources with the
relativistic thin AD model KERRBB in order to infer the black hole masses and
compared them with those from Reverberation mapping and Single epoch methods,
discussing the possible uncertainties linked to such a model by quantifying
their weight on our results. We find that for the majority of the sources,
KERRBB is a good description of the AD emission for a wide wavelength range.
The overall uncertainty on the black hole mass estimated through the disk
fitting procedure is $\sim 0.45$ dex (which includes the uncertainty on fitting
parameters such as e.g. spin and viewing angle), comparable to the systematic
uncertainty of reverberation mapping and single epoch methods; however, such an
uncertainty can be $\leq 0.3$ dex if one of the parameters of the fit is well
constrained. Although all of the estimates are affected by large uncertainties,
the masses inferred using the three methods are compatible if the dimensionless
scale factor $f$ (linked to the unknown kinematics and geometry of the Broad
Line Region) is assumed to be larger than one. For the majority of the sources,
the comparison between the results coming from the three methods favors small
spin values. To check the goodness of the KERRBB results, we compared them with
those inferred with other models, such as AGNSED, a model that also accounts
for the emission originating from an X-ray corona: using two sources with a
good data coverage in the X band, we find that the masses estimated with the

astronomy and dark matter physics. However, most direct measures of mass cannot
be applied to tidal debris, as the systems of interest are no longer in
equilibrium. Since phase-space density is conserved during adiabatic phase
mixing, Liouville's theorem provides a connection between stellar kinematics as
measured by observatories such as Gaia and the original mass of the disrupted
system. Accurately recovering the phase-space density is complicated by
uncertainties resulting from measurement errors and orbital integration, which
both effectively inject entropy into the system, preferentially decreasing the
measured density. In this paper, we demonstrate that these two issues can be
overcome. First, we measure the phase-space density of the globular cluster M4
in Gaia data, and use Liouville's theorem to derive its mass. We then show
that, for tidally disrupted systems, the orbital parameters and thus
phase-space density can be inferred by minimizing the phase-space entropy of
cold stellar streams. This work is therefore a proof of principle that true
phase-space density can be measured and the original properties of the star
cluster reconstructed in systems of astrophysical interest.

evolution towards merger. Here we explore a new channel for the production of
binary mergers in clusters, in which the tidal field of the cluster secularly
drives the binary to high eccentricity (even in the absence of a central
massive black hole) until gravitational wave emission becomes important. We
employ the recently developed secular theory of cluster tide-driven binary
evolution to compute present day merger rates for BH-BH, NS-BH and NS-NS
binaries, varying cluster potential and central concentration of the binary
population (but ignoring cluster evolution and stellar flybys for now). Unlike
other mechanisms, this new dynamical channel can produce a significant number
of mergers out to cluster-centric distances of several pc. For NS-NS binaries
we find merger rates in the range $0.01-0.07$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ from
globular clusters and $0.1-0.2$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ from cusped nuclear
clusters. For NS-BH and BH-BH binaries we find small merger rates from globular
clusters, but a rate of $0.1 - 0.2$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ from cusped nuclear
clusters, contributing to the observed LIGO/Virgo rate at the level of several
per cent. Therefore, cluster tide-driven mergers constitute a new channel that
can be further explored with current and future gravitational wave detectors.

hypothesized in S83, incoming synoptic eddies experience a meridional straining
effect when approaching a split jetstream, and as a result, enhanced PV fluxes
reinforce the block. A two-layer QG model is adopted here as a minimal model to
conduct mechanism-denial experiments. While transient eddies' forcing is
clearly critical to the formation and maintenance of a block, using a large
ensemble, the authors demonstrate that the straining of generic eddies does not
maintain blocks, thus challenge the idea of eddy straining serving as a
positive feedback for the blocks. These results indicate that specific
configurations of the eddy field are required for the maintenance stage. The

hydrodynamic model is based on the neutrino hydrodynamic simulation of a 8.8

bounce. Before this, CNO is suppressed by matter-induced decoherence. In the
inverted mass hierarchy, the spectrum of $\bar{\nu}_e$ becomes softer after the
onset of CNO. To evaluate the detectability of this modification, we define a
hardness ratio between the number of high energy neutrino events and low energy
neutrino events adopting a fixed critical energy. We show that Hyper-Kamiokande

kpc. On the other hand, for the normal mass hierarchy, the spectrum of $\nu_e$
becomes softer after the onset of CNO, and we show that DUNE can distinguish
this feature for supernova distances out to $\sim 10$ kpc. More work is
necessary to optimize the best value of critical energy for maximum
sensitivity. We also show that if the spectrum of $\bar{\nu}_e$ in HK becomes
softer due to CNO, the spectrum of $\nu_e$ in DUNE becomes harder, and vice
versa. This synergistic observations in $\bar{\nu}_e$ and $\nu_e$, by HK and
DUNE respectively, will be an intriguing opportunity to test the occurrence of

been proposed to address this issue and obtain linear scaling $\mathcal O(M)$.
One promising formulation is the direct minimization of energy. Such methods
take advantage of physical localization of the solution, namely that the
solution can be sought in terms of non-orthogonal orbitals with local support.
In this work a numerically efficient implementation of sparse parallel vectors
within the open-source finite element library deal.II is proposed. The main
algorithmic ingredient is the matrix-free evaluation of the Hamiltonian
operator by cell-wise quadrature. Based on an a-priori chosen support for each
vector we develop algorithms and data structures to perform (i) matrix-free
sparse matrix multivector products (SpMM), (ii) the projection of an operator
onto a sparse sub-space (inner products), and (iii) post-multiplication of a
sparse multivector with a square matrix. The node-level performance is analyzed

their formation path is still unclear. In the most common scenarios, NSCs form
in-situ from the galaxy's central gas reservoir, through merging of globular
clusters (GCs), or through a combination of the two. As the scenarios pose
different expectations for angular momentum and stellar population properties
of the NSC in comparison to the host galaxy and the GC system, it is necessary
to characterise the stellar light, NSC and GCs simultaneously. The large NSC
(r$_\rm{eff} = 66$ pc) and rich GC system of the early-type Fornax cluster
galaxy FCC47 (NGC1336) render this galaxy an ideal laboratory to constrain NSC
formation. Using MUSE science verification data assisted by adaptive optics, we
obtained maps for the stellar kinematics and for stellar-population properties
of FCC47. We extracted the spectra of the central NSC and determined
line-of-sight velocities of 24 GCs and metallicities of five. FCC47 shows two
decoupled components (KDCs): a rotating disk and the NSC. Our orbit-based
dynamical Schwarzschild model revealed that the NSC is a distinct kinematic
feature and it constitutes the peak of metallicity and old ages in the galaxy.
The main body consists of two counter-rotating populations and is dominated by
a more metal-poor population. The GC system is bimodal with a dominant
metal-poor population and the total GC system mass is $\sim 17\%$ of the NSC
mass ($\sim$ 7 $\times$ $10^8 M_\odot$). The rotation, high metallicity and
high mass of the NSC cannot be uniquely explained by GC-inspiral and most
likely requires additional, but quickly quenched, in-situ formation. The
presence of two KDCs most probably are evidence of a major merger that has
altered the structure of FCC47 significantly, indicating the important role of
galaxy mergers in forming the complex kinematics in the galaxy-NSC system.

4.1$^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$ R$_{ISCO}$ (where R$_{ISCO}\equiv$ radius of the innermost
stable circular orbit) or 5.1$^{+1.0}_{-0.7}$ r$_{g}$ (where r$_{g}\equiv$
gravitational radius) and 29.8$^{+3.0}_{-2.7}$ $^\circ$ respectively. The best
fit broad-band spectra suggest that the source was in the hard state and
evolving. The source emission is best described by weak thermal emission along
with strong thermal Comptonization from a relatively cold, optically thick,
geometrically thin and ionized accretion disk. X-ray spectral modeling helps us
to understand the accretion and ejection properties in the vicinity of the

high-ionization emission lines in the early optical spectra, yet the optical
lightcurve evolution suggests that an extra energy source from circumstellar
medium (CSM) interaction must be present for at least 2 days after explosion.
Modeling of the early lightcurve indicates a ~500R$_{\odot}$ progenitor radius,
consistent with a rather compact red supergiant, and late-time luminosities
indicate up to 0.130 $\pm$ 0.026 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni are present, if the
lightcurve is solely powered by radioactive decay, although the $^{56}$Ni mass
may be lower if CSM interaction contributes to the post-plateau luminosity.
Prominent multi-peaked emission lines of H$\alpha$ and [O I] emerge after day
154, as a result of either an asymmetric explosion or asymmetries in the CSM.
The lack of narrow lines within the first two days of explosion in the likely
presence of CSM interaction may be an example of close, dense, asymmetric CSM
that is quickly enveloped by the spherical supernova ejecta.

exo-systems have been looked for in the past decades. Indeed planets in
close-in orbit can be magnetically connected to their host star, and channel
Alfv\'en waves carrying large amounts of energy towards the central star. The
strength and temporal modulation of SPMIs are primarily set by the magnetic
topology of the host star and the orbital characteristics of the planet. As a
result, SPMI signals can be modulated over the rotational period of the star,
the orbital period of the planet, or a complex combination of the two. The
detection of SPMI thus have to rely on multiple-epochs and multiple-wavelengths
observational campaigns. We present a new method to characterize SPMIs and
apply it to Kepler-78, a late G star with a super-Earth on an 8.5 hours orbit.
We model the corona of Kepler-78 using the large-scale magnetic topology of the
star observed with Zeeman-Doppler-Imaging. We show that the closeness of
Kepler-78b allows the interaction to channel energy flux densities up to a few
kW m$^{-2}$ towards the central star. We show that this flux is large enough to
be detectable in classical activity tracers such as H$\alpha$. It is
nonetheless too weak to explain the modulation observed by \citet{Moutou2016}.
We furthermore demonstrate how to predict the temporal modulation of SPMI
signals in observed systems such as Kepler-78. The methodology presented here
thus paves the road towards denser, specific observational campaigns that would
allow a proper identification of SPMIs in compact star-planet systems.

investigate the structural properties of a two-stage model. Based on the
structural properties, two efficient algorithms are designed to solve the
two-stage model. Algorithm 1 solves the problem to its optimality and Algorithm
2 heuristically searches for high-quality solutions based on Algorithm 1. Our

from the machine learning community and from wider parties interested in
ethical prediction algorithms. In no small part, this has been due to the fact
that causal models allow one to simultaneously leverage data and expert
knowledge to remove discriminatory effects from predictions. However, one of
the primary assumptions in causal modeling is that you know the causal graph.
This introduces a new opportunity for bias, caused by misspecifying the causal
model. One common way for misspecification to occur is via unmeasured
confounding: the true causal effect between variables is partially described by
unobserved quantities. In this work we design tools to assess the sensitivity
of fairness measures to this confounding for the popular class of non-linear
additive noise models (ANMs). Specifically, we give a procedure for computing
the maximum difference between two counterfactually fair predictors, where one
has become biased due to confounding. For the case of bivariate confounding our
technique can be swiftly computed via a sequence of closed-form updates. For
multivariate confounding we give an algorithm that can be efficiently solved
via automatic differentiation. We demonstrate our new sensitivity analysis
tools in real-world fairness scenarios to assess the bias arising from
confounding.

number of large, heterogeneous clusters when the treatment effect is identified
by comparisons across clusters. The procedure asymptotically controls size by
applying a level-adjusted permutation test to a suitable statistic. The
adjustments needed for most empirically relevant situations are tabulated in
the paper. The adjusted permutation test is easy to implement in practice and
performs well at conventional levels of significance with at least four treated
clusters and a similar number of control clusters. It is particularly robust to
situations where some clusters are much more variable than others. Examples and
an empirical application are provided.

interactions by their effect on the flux of neutrinos originating from a
galactic supernova. In the dense medium of a core collapse supernova, these new
self interactions can have a significant impact on neutrino oscillations,
leading to changes at the flavor evolution and spectra level. We use
simulations of the neutrino flux from a 13 solar mass, core collapse supernova
at 10 kpc away, and numerically propagate these neutrinos through the stellar
medium taking into account vacuum/MSW oscillations, SM $\nu-\nu$ scattering as
well as $\nu-\nu$ interactions that arise from NSSI. We pass the resulting
neutrino flux to a simulation of the future Hyper-Kamiokande detector to see
what constraints on NSSI parameters are possible when the next galactic
supernova becomes visible. We find that these constraints depend strongly on
the neutrino mass hierarchy and if the NSSI is flavor-violating or preserving.
Sensitivity to NSSI in the normal hierarchy (NH) at Hyper-K is limited by the
experiment's ability to efficiently detect $\nu_{e}$, but deviations from no
NSSI could be seen if the NSSI is particularly strong. In the inverted
hierarchy (IH) scenario, Hyper-K can significantly improve constraints on
flavor-violating NSSI down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})G_{F}$.

stepped vicinal nanostructures modeled in a simple Kronig-Penney scheme. The
unoccupied bands of the surface are resonantly excited \textit{via} the
resonant charge transfer (RCT) interaction of the surface with a hydrogen anion
reflected at grazing angles. The interaction dynamics is simulated numerically
in a quantum mechanical wave packet propagation approach. Visualization of the
wave packet density shows that, when the electron is transferred to the metal,
the surface and image subband states are the most likely locations of the
electron as it evolves through the superlattice. The survival probability of
the interacting ion exhibits strong modulations as a function of the
vicinal-terrace size and shows peaks at those energies that access the image
state subband dispersions. A simple square well model producing standing waves
between the steps on the surface suggests the application of such
ion-scattering at shallow angles to map electronic substructures in vicinal
surfaces. The work also serves as the first proof-of-principle in the utility
of our computational method to address, via RCT, surfaces with nanometric

(VAR) models. VARs are popular tools for macroeconomic forecasting and use of
larger models has been demonstrated to often improve the forecasting ability
compared to more traditional small-scale models. Mixed-frequency VARs deal with
data sampled at different frequencies while remaining within the realms of
VARs. Estimation of mixed-frequency VARs makes use of simulation smoothing, but
using the standard procedure these models quickly become prohibitive in
nowcasting situations as the size of the model grows. We propose two algorithms
that alleviate the computational efficiency of the simulation smoothing
algorithm. Our preferred choice is an adaptive algorithm, which augments the
state vector as necessary to sample also monthly variables that are missing at
the end of the sample. For large VARs, we find considerable improvements in
speed using our adaptive algorithm. The algorithm therefore provides a crucial
building block for bringing the mixed-frequency VARs to the high-dimensional

tissue interactions and is an important prerequisite for metastatic spread, the
main cause of cancer related deaths. Occurring over many different temporal and
spatial scales, the first stage of local invasion is the secretion of
matrix-degrading enzymes (MDEs) and the resulting degradation of the
extra-cellular matrix (ECM). This process creates space in which the cells can
invade and thus enlarge the tumour. As a tumour increases in malignancy, the
cancer cells adopt the ability to mutate into secondary cell subpopulations
giving rise to a heterogeneous tumour. This new cell subpopulation often
carries higher invasive qualities and permits a quicker spread of the tumour.
Building upon the recent multiscale modelling framework for cancer invasion
within a fibrous ECM introduced in Shuttleworth and Trucu (2019), in this paper
we consider the process of local invasion by a heterotypic tumour consisting of
two cancer cell populations mixed with a two-phase ECM. To that end, we address
the double feedback link between the tissue-scale cancer dynamics and the
cell-scale molecular processes through the development of a two-part modelling
framework that crucially incorporates the multiscale dynamic redistribution of
oriented fibres occurring within a two-phase extra-cellular matrix and combines
this with the multiscale leading edge dynamics exploring key matrix-degrading
enzymes molecular processes along the tumour interface that drive the movement
of the cancer boundary. The modelling framework will be accompanied by
computational results that explore the effects of the underlying fibre network
on the overall pattern of cancer invasion.

the ``dip'' region, between the quasielastic and the $\Delta$ (1232) peaks.
Predictions for $^{12}$C$(\nu,\mu\,\pi)$ have also been made. They can be used
to estimate pion-emission rates in neutrino-nucleus cross section, which
constitutes an important systematic uncertainty to the reconstructed neutrino
energy. With further improvements of the Metropolis Monte-Carlo techniques to

much attention over the last two decades. DE is a simple yet powerful
evolutionary algorithm that has been used successfully to optimize various
real-world problems. Since it was introduced, many researchers have developed
new methods for DE, and one of them makes use of a mutation based on the Cauchy
distribution to increase the convergence speed of DE. The method monitors the
results of each individual in the selection operator and performs the Cauchy
mutation on consecutively failed individuals, which generates mutant vectors by
perturbing the best individual with the Cauchy distribution. Therefore, the
method can locate the consecutively failed individuals to new positions close
to the best individual. Although this approach is interesting, it fails to take
into account establishing a balance between exploration and exploitation. In
this paper, we propose a sigmoid based parameter control that alters the
failure threshold for performing the Cauchy mutation in a time-varying
schedule, which can establish a good ratio between exploration and
exploitation. Experiments and comparisons have been done with six conventional
and six advanced DE variants on a set of 30 benchmark problems, which indicate
that the DE variants assisted by the proposed algorithm are highly competitive,
especially for multimodal functions.

satisfy kinematics- and physics-based requirements. We present a classification
of constraints and solvers to enable postponing optimization as far down the
design workflow as possible. The solvers are organized into two broad classes
of design space 'pruning' and 'exploration' by considering the types of
constraints they can satisfy. We show that pointwise constraints define
feasible design subspaces that can be represented and computed as first-class
entities by their maximal feasible elements. The design space is pruned upfront
by intersecting maximal elements, without premature optimization. To solve for
other constraints, we apply topology optimization (TO), starting from the
pruned feasible space. The optimization is steered by a topological sensitivity
field (TSF) that measures the global changes in violation of constraints with
respect to local topological punctures. The TSF for global objective functions
is augmented with TSF for global constraints, and penalized/filtered to
incorporate local constraints, including set constraints converted to
differentiable (in)equality constraints. We demonstrate application of the
proposed workflow to nontrivial examples in design and manufacturing. Among
other examples, we show how to explore pruned design spaces via TO to
simultaneously satisfy physics-based constraints (e.g., minimize compliance and
mass) as well as kinematics-based constraints (e.g., maximize accessibility for
machining).

to the nonlinear matter power spectrum extracted from $N$-body simulations

fractional deviation in the absolute matter power spectrum produced by a target
cosmology away from a reference $\Lambda$CDM prediction. From the computational
perspective, $\delta(k,a)$ is fairly insensitive to the specifics of the
simulation settings, and numerical convergence at the 1%-level can be readily
achieved without the need for huge computing capacity. Furthermore,
$\delta(k,a)$ exhibits several interesting properties that enable a piece-wise
construction of the full fitting function, whereby component fitting functions
are sought for single-parameter variations and then multiplied together to form
the final product. Then, to obtain 1%-accurate absolute power spectrum
predictions for any target cosmology only requires that the community as a
whole invests in producing one single ultra-precise reference $\Lambda$CDM
absolute power spectrum, to be combined with the fitting function to produce
the desired result. To illustrate the power of this approach, we have
constructed the fitting function RelFit using only five relatively inexpensive
$w$CDM simulations (box length $L=256 h^{-1}$Mpc, $N=1024^3$ particles,
initialised at $z_i=49$). In a 6-parameter space spanning
$\{\omega_m,A_s,n_s,w,\omega_b,h\}$, the output relative power spectra of
RelFit are consistent with the predictions of the CosmicEmu emulator to 1% or
better for a wide range of cosmologies up to $k\simeq 10$/Mpc. Thus, our
approach could provide an inexpensive and democratically accessible route to
fulfilling the 1%-level accuracy demands of the upcoming generation of

outliers, yet there is a paucity of work on handling outliers in unsupervised

outlier inclusion methods and trimming methods, which often require
pre-specification of the number of points to remove. The fact that sample
Mahalanobis distance is beta-distributed is used to derive an approximate

the mode's frequency in our simulations is $\sim 15\%$ higher, due to the use

approximation. This overestimation is particularly important for the analysis
of gravitational wave detectability and asteroseismology, pointing to
limitations of pseudo-Newtonian approaches for these purposes, possibly even
resulting in excitation of incorrect modes. In addition, mode frequency

misidentification in recent work. Lastly, we evaluate the prospects of a

the size of the tumor. The model is a coupled system of an elliptic equation, a
parabolic equation and an ordinary differential equation. It incorporates the
cell location under the presence of time delay, with the tumor boundary as a
free boundary. A parameter $\mu$ in the model is proportional to the
""aggressiveness"" of the tumor. It is proved that there exists a unique
classical radially symmetric stationary solution $(\sigma_*, p_*, R_*)$ which
is stable for any $\mu > 0$ with respect to all radially symmetric

symplectomorphism $\phi$. $T_\phi$ is another Weinstein domain and its contact
boundary is independent of $\phi$. In this paper, we distinguish $\phi$ from
$T_{1_M}$, under certain assumptions (Theorem 1.1). As an application, we
obtain pairs of diffeomorphic Weinstein domains with the same contact boundary
and whose symplectic cohomology groups are the same, as vector spaces, but that
are different as Liouville domains. To our knowledge, this is the first example
of such pairs that can be distinguished by their wrapped Fukaya category.
  Previously, we have suggested a categorical model $M_\phi$ for the wrapped
Fukaya category $\mathcal{W}(T_\phi)$, and we have distinguished $M_\phi$ from
the mapping torus category of the identity. In this paper, we prove
$\mathcal{W}(T_\phi)$ and $M_\phi$ are derived equivalent (Theorem 1.9); hence,
deducing the promised Theorem 1.1. Theorem 1.9 is of independent interest as it
preludes an algebraic description of wrapped Fukaya categories of locally

vector space over $\mathbb{K}$ with finite positive dimension. Let $A,A^*$
denote a tridiagonal pair on $V$. We assume that $A,A^*$ belongs to a family of
tridiagonal pairs said to have $q$-Racah type. Let $\{U_i\}_{i=0}^d$ and
$\{U_i^\Downarrow\}_{i=0}^{d}$ denote the first and second split decompositions
of $V$. In an earlier paper we introduced a double lowering operator $\psi:V\to
V$ with the notable feature that both $\psi U_i\subseteq U_{i-1}$ and $\psi
U_i^\Downarrow\subseteq U_{i-1}^\Downarrow$ for $0\leq i\leq d$, where
$U_{-1}=0$ and $U_{-1}^\Downarrow=0$. In the same paper, we showed that there
exists a unique linear transformation $\Delta:V\to V$ such that
$\Delta(U_i)\subseteq U_i^{\Downarrow}$ and $(\Delta -I)U_i\subseteq
U_0+U_1+\cdots +U_{i-1}$ for $0\leq i \leq d$. In the present paper, we show
that $\Delta$ can be expressed as a product of two linear transformations; one
is a $q$-exponential in $\psi$ and the other is a $q^{-1}$-exponential in
$\psi$. We view $\Delta$ as a transition matrix from the first split
decomposition of $V$ to the second. Consequently, we view the
$q^{-1}$-exponential in $\psi$ as a transition matrix from the first split
decomposition to a decomposition of $V$ which we interpret as a kind of halfway
point. This halfway point turns out to be the eigenspace decomposition of a
certain linear transformation $\mathcal{M}$. We discuss the eigenspace
decomposition of $\mathcal{M}$ and give the actions of various operators on
this decomposition.

the iron-group, intermediate-mass alpha-nuclei (silicon, sulfur, argon, and
calcium) stand out in their spectra up to several weeks past maximum
brightness. Recent measurements of the abundances of calcium, argon, and sulfur
in type Ia supernova remnants have been interpreted in terms of
metallicity-dependent oxygen burning, in accordance with previous theoretical
predictions. It is known that $\alpha$-rich oxygen burning results from
$^{16}$O$\rightarrow^{12}$C followed by efficient $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion
reaction, as compared to oxygen consumption by $^{16}$O fusion reactions, but
the precise mechanism of dependence on the progenitor metallicity has remained
unidentified so far. I show that the chain
$^{16}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{13}$N($\gamma$,p)$^{12}$C boosts $\alpha$-rich oxygen
burning when the proton abundance is large, increasing the synthesis of argon
and calcium with respect to sulfur and silicon. For high-metallicity
progenitors, the presence of free neutrons leads to a drop in the proton
abundance and the above chain is not efficient. Although the rate of
$^{16}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{13}$N can be found in astrophysical reaction rate
libraries, its uncertainty is unconstrained. Assuming that all reaction rates
other than $^{16}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{13}$N retain their standard values, an
increase by a factor of approximately seven of the $^{16}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{13}$N
rate at temperatures in the order $3-5\times10^9$ K is enough to explain the
whole range of calcium-to-sulfur mass ratios measured in Milky Way and LMC

  Railway Points","Accepted by KDD2019 Applied Data Science track",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Railway points are among the key components of railway infrastructure. As a
part of signal equipment, points control the routes of trains at railway
junctions, having a significant impact on the reliability, capacity, and
punctuality of rail transport. Traditionally, maintenance of points is based on
a fixed time interval or raised after the equipment failures. Instead, it would
be of great value if we could forecast points' failures and take action
beforehand, minimising any negative effect. To date, most of the existing
prediction methods are either lab-based or relying on specially installed
sensors which makes them infeasible for large-scale implementation. Besides,
they often use data from only one source. We, therefore, explore a new way that
integrates multi-source data which are ready to hand to fulfil this task. We
conducted our case study based on Sydney Trains rail network which is an
extensive network of passenger and freight railways. Unfortunately, the
real-world data are usually incomplete due to various reasons, e.g., faults in
the database, operational errors or transmission faults. Besides, railway
points differ in their locations, types and some other properties, which means
it is hard to use a unified model to predict their failures. Aiming at this
challenging task, we firstly constructed a dataset from multiple sources and
selected key features with the help of domain experts. In this paper, we
formulate our prediction task as a multiple kernel learning problem with
missing kernels. We present a robust multiple kernel learning algorithm for
predicting points failures. Our model takes into account the missing pattern of
data as well as the inherent variance on different sets of railway points.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm compared
with other state-of-the-art methods.

without Riemann solvers in modelling the interaction of shock waves with
one-dimensional and two-dimensional bubbles in gas-gas and liquid-gas flows.
For a gas bubble suspended in another gas, the mesh resolution and the applied
advection schemes are found to only have a minor influence on the bubble shape
and position, as well as the behaviour of the dominant shock waves and
rarefaction fans. For a gas bubble suspended in a liquid, however, the mesh
resolution has a critical influence on the shape, the position and the
post-shock evolution of the bubble, as well as the pressure and temperature
distribution.

the major activity in high energy blazars a subgrup of blazars. Flaring is also
unpredictable and switches between quiescent and active states involving
different time scales and fluxes. While in some high energy blazars a strong
temporal correlation between X-ray and multi-TeV gamma-ray has been observed,
outbursts in some other have no low energy counterparts and explanation of such
extreme activity needs to be addressed through different mechanisms as it is
not understood well. The extragalactic background light (EBL) plays an
important role in the observation of these high energy gamma-rays as it
attenuates through pair production of electron-positron and also changes the
spectral shape of the high energy photons. In the context of the photohadronic
model and taking EBL correction into account, flaring can be explained very
well. In a series of papers we have developed this model to explain multi-TeV
flaring events form many blazars. Here in this review, the photohadronic model
is discussed and applied to explain the multi-TeV flaring from nearby high
energy blazars: Markarian 421, Markarian 501 and 1ES1959+650.

establish its asymptotic properties. To improve the parameter estimation, we
propose a joint quasi-likelihood function that is built on the marriage of
daily integrated volatility estimated by high-frequency data and nonparametric

airborne camera is very useful for video analytics applications. Using fast low
power algorithms for onboard moving object detection would also provide region
of interest-based semantic information for scene content aware image
compression. This would enable more efficient and flexible communication link
utilization in lowbandwidth airborne cloud computing networks. Despite recent
advances in both UAV or drone platforms and imaging sensor technologies,
vehicle detection from aerial video remains challenging due to small object
sizes, platform motion and camera jitter, obscurations, scene complexity and
degraded imaging conditions. This paper proposes an efficient moving vehicle
detection pipeline which synergistically fuses both appearance and motion-based
detections in a complementary manner using deep learning combined with flux
tensor spatio-temporal filtering. Our proposed multi-cue pipeline is able to
detect moving vehicles with high precision and recall, while filtering out
false positives such as parked vehicles, through intelligent fusion.
Experimental results show that incorporating contextual information of moving
vehicles enables high semantic compression ratios of over 100:1 with high image
fidelity, for better utilization of limited bandwidth air-to-ground network
links.

magnetograms, and discuss nonlinear force-free (NLFF) solutions based on two
different sets of the free model parameters. The two time series differ from
each other concerning their force-free and solenoidal quality. Both force- and
divergence-freeness are required for a consistent NLFF solution. Full
satisfaction of the solenoidal property is inherent in the definition of
relative magnetic helicity in order to insure gauge-independence. We apply two
different magnetic helicity computation methods (Thalmann et al. 2011; Valori
et al. 2012) to both NLFF time series and find that the output is highly
dependent on the level to which the NLFF magnetic fields satisfy the
divergence-free condition, with the computed magnetic energy being less
sensitive than the relative helicity. Proxies for the non-potentiality and
eruptivity derived from both quantities are also shown to depend strongly on
the solenoidal property of the NLFF fields. As a reference for future
applications, we provide quantitative thresholds for the force- and
divergence-freeness, for the assurance of reliable computation of magnetic

variety of applications. Nevertheless, direct use of the computer model for the
ultimate scientific objective is often limited by the complexity and cost of
the model. Historically, Gaussian process regression has proven to be the
almost ubiquitous choice for a fast statistical emulator for such a computer
model, due to its flexible form and analytical expressions for measures of
predictive uncertainty. However, even this statistical emulator can be
computationally intractable for large designs, due to computing time increasing

  We then propose solving this problem using an adaptive partitioning emulator

only complex in particular regions of the input space. By taking a
data-adaptive approach to the development of a design, and choosing to
partition the space in the regions of highest variability, we obtain a higher
density of points in these regions and hence accurate prediction.

Gaussian mixture (GM) models are proven in this work as fitting marginal

(BECs) can be formulated as an energy minimization problem with two quadratic
constraints. We discretize the energy functional and constraints using the
Fourier pseudospectral schemes and view the discretized problem as an
optimization problem on manifold. Three different types of retractions to the
manifold are designed. They enable us to apply various optimization methods on
manifold to solve the problem. Specifically, an adaptive regularized Newton
method is used together with a cascadic multigrid technique to accelerate the
convergence. According to our limited knowledege, our method is the first
applicable algorithm for BECs with an arbitrary integer spin, including the
complicated spin-3 BECs. Extensive numerical results on ground states of
spin-1, spin-2 and spin-3 BECs with diverse interaction and optical lattice
potential in one/two/three dimensions are reported to show the efficiency of
our method and to demonstrate some interesting physical phenomena.

attuned to the control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Even though UAVs are
becoming widespread, the task of creating voice interfaces for them is largely
unaddressed. To this end, we introduce a multi-modal evaluation dataset for UAV
control, consisting of spoken commands and associated images, which represent
the visual context of what the UAV ""sees"" when the pilot utters the command. We
provide baseline results and address two research directions: (i) how robust
the language models are, given an incomplete list of commands at train time;
(ii) how to incorporate visual information in the language model. We find that
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a solution to both tasks: they can be
successfully adapted using a small number of commands and they can be extended
to use visual cues. Our results show that the image-based RNN outperforms its
text-only counterpart even if the command-image training associations are
automatically generated and inherently imperfect. The dataset and our code are

vulnerable to evasion attacks, i.e., carefully crafted perturbations of test
inputs designed to force prediction errors. In this paper we focus on evasion
attacks against decision tree ensembles, which are among the most successful
predictive models for dealing with non-perceptual problems. Even though they
are powerful and interpretable, decision tree ensembles have received only
limited attention by the security and machine learning communities so far,
leading to a sub-optimal state of the art for adversarial learning techniques.
We thus propose Treant, a novel decision tree learning algorithm that, on the
basis of a formal threat model, minimizes an evasion-aware loss function at
each step of the tree construction. Treant is based on two key technical
ingredients: robust splitting and attack invariance, which jointly guarantee
the soundness of the learning process. Experimental results on three publicly
available datasets show that Treant is able to generate decision tree ensembles
that are at the same time accurate and nearly insensitive to evasion attacks,
outperforming state-of-the-art adversarial learning techniques.

minimize idleness (the time between consecutive visits of sensing locations)

surveillance scenarios where sensing locations should not only be visited
periodically, but the captured data also should reach the base station in due
time even if the area is larger than the communication range. Our approach
employs the concept of minimum-latency paths (MLP) to guarantee that the data
reaches the base station within a predefined latency bound. To reach the bound,
multiple UAVs cooperatively transport the data in a store-and-forward fashion.
Additionally, MLPs specify a lower bound for any latency minimization problem
where multiple mobile agents transport data in a store-and-forward fashion. We
introduce three variations of a heuristic employing MLPs and compare their
performance in a simulation study. The results show that extensions of the
simplest of our approaches, where data is transported after each visit of a

society. Their failure can have severe impact on both economics and human life.
Hence, these systems have become an attractive target for attacks, both
physical and cyber. A number of attack detection methods have been proposed,
however they are characterized by a low detection rate, a substantial false
positive rate, or are system specific. In this paper, we study an attack
detection method based on simple and lightweight neural networks, namely, 1D
convolutions and autoencoders. We apply these networks to both the time and
frequency domains of the collected data and discuss pros and cons of each
approach. We evaluate the suggested method on three popular public datasets and
achieve detection rates matching or exceeding previously published detection
results, while featuring small footprint, short training and detection times,
and generality. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of PCA, which, given
proper data preprocessing and feature selection, can provide high attack
detection scores in many settings. Finally, we study the proposed method's
robustness against adversarial attacks, that exploit inherent blind spots of
neural networks to evade detection while achieving their intended physical
effect. Our results show that the proposed method is robust to such evasion
attacks: in order to evade detection, the attacker is forced to sacrifice the
desired physical impact on the system. This finding suggests that neural
networks trained under the constraints of the laws of physics can be trusted
more than networks trained under more flexible conditions.

how fitness landscapes can be represented using valued constraints, and
investigate what the structure of such representations reveals about the
complexity of local search.
  First, we show that for fitness landscapes representable by binary Boolean
valued constraints there is a minimal necessary constraint graph that can be
easily computed. Second, we consider landscapes as equivalent if they allow the
same (improving) local search moves; we show that a minimal constraint graph
still exists, but is NP-hard to compute.
  We then develop several techniques to bound the length of any sequence of
local search moves. We show that such a bound can be obtained from the
numerical values of the constraints in the representation, and show how this
bound may be tightened by considering equivalent representations. In the binary
Boolean case, we prove that a degree 2 or tree-structured constraint graph
gives a quadratic bound on the number of improving moves made by any local
search; hence, any landscape that can be represented by such a model will be
tractable for any form of local search.
  Finally, we build two families of examples to show that the conditions in our
tractability results are essential. With domain size three, even just a path of
binary constraints can model a landscape with an exponentially long sequence of
improving moves. With a treewidth-two constraint graph, even with a maximum
degree of three, binary Boolean constraints can model a landscape with an
exponentially long sequence of improving moves.

  the vicinity of the Cooper minima of argon",,,,,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Attosecond photoionization delays have mostly been interpreted within the
single-particle approximation of multi-electron systems. The strong electron
correlation between the photoionization channels associated with the 3p and 3s
orbitals of argon presents an interesting arena where this single-particle
approximation breaks down. Around photon energies of 42~eV, the 3s
photoionization channel of argon experiences a ``Cooper-like"" minimum, which is
exclusively the result of inter-electronic correlations with the 3p shell.
Photoionization delays around this ``Cooper-like"" minimum have been predicted
theoretically, but experimental verification has remained a challenge since the
associated photoionization cross section is inherently very low. Here, we
report the measurement of photoionization delays around the Cooper-like minimum
that were acquired with the 100~kHz High-Repetition 1 laser system at the
ELI-ALPS facility. We report relative photoionization delays reaching up to
unprecedented values of 430 +/- 20~as, as a result of electron correlation. Our
experimental results are in partial agreement with state-of-the-art theoretical
results, but also demonstrate the need for additional theoretical developments.

  and Markov reward process","8 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In team-based invasion sports such as soccer and basketball, analytics is
important for teams to understand their performance and for audiences to
understand matches better. The present work focuses on performing visual
analytics to evaluate the value of any kind of event occurring in a sports
match with a continuous parameter space. Here, the continuous parameter space
involves the time, location, score, and other parameters. Because the
spatiotemporal data used in such analytics is a low-level representation and
has a very large size, however, traditional analytics may need to discretize
the continuous parameter space (e.g., subdivide the playing area) or use a
local feature to limit the analysis to specific events (e.g., only shots).
These approaches make evaluation impossible for any kind of event with a
continuous parameter space. To solve this problem, we consider a whole match as
a Markov chain of significant events, so that event values can be estimated
with a continuous parameter space by solving the Markov chain with a machine
learning model. The significant events are first extracted by considering the
time-varying distribution of players to represent the whole match. Then, the
extracted events are redefined as different states with the continuous
parameter space and built as a Markov chain so that a Markov reward process can
be applied. Finally, the Markov reward process is solved by a customized
fitted-value iteration algorithm so that the event values with the continuous
parameter space can be predicted by a regression model. As a result, the event
values can be visually inspected over the whole playing field under arbitrary
given conditions. Experimental results with real soccer data show the
effectiveness of the proposed system.

belief change the so-called `Harper Identity' (HI), which defines single-shot
contraction in terms of single-shot revision. The present paper considers the
prospects of providing a similar extension of the Levi Identity (LI), in which
the direction of definition runs the other way. We restrict our attention here
to the three classic iterated revision operators--natural, restrained and
lexicographic, for which we provide here the first collective characterisation
in the literature, under the appellation of `elementary' operators. We consider
two prima facie plausible ways of extending (LI). The first proposal involves
the use of the rational closure operator to offer a `reductive' account of
iterated revision in terms of iterated contraction. The second, which doesn't
commit to reductionism, was put forward some years ago by Nayak et al. We
establish that, for elementary revision operators and under mild assumptions
regarding contraction, Nayak's proposal is equivalent to a new set of
postulates formalising the claim that contraction by $\neg A$ should be
considered to be a kind of `mild' revision by $A$. We then show that these, in
turn, under slightly weaker assumptions, jointly amount to the conjunction of a
pair of constraints on the extension of (HI) that were recently proposed in the
literature. Finally, we consider the consequences of endorsing both suggestions
and show that this would yield an identification of rational revision with
natural revision. We close the paper by discussing the general prospects for
defining iterated revision in terms of iterated contraction.

  WV-Polygon",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of vertex guarding a simple polygon was first studied by Subir K.
Ghosh (1987), who presented a polynomial-time $O(\log n)$-approximation
algorithm for placing as few guards as possible at vertices of a simple $n$-gon
$P$, such that every point in $P$ is visible to at least one of the guards.
Ghosh also conjectured that this problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm
with constant approximation ratio. Due to the centrality of guarding problems
in the field of computational geometry, much effort has been invested
throughout the years in trying to resolve this conjecture. Despite some
progress (surveyed below), the conjecture remains unresolved to date. In this
paper, we confirm the conjecture for the important case of weakly visible
polygons, by presenting a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for
guarding such a polygon using vertex guards. A simple polygon $P$ is weakly
visible if it has an edge $e$, such that every point in $P$ is visible from
some point on $e$. We also present a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for guarding a weakly visible polygon $P$, where guards may be placed anywhere
on $P$'s boundary (except in the interior of the edge $e$). Finally, we present
a $3c$-approximation algorithm for vertex guarding a polygon $P$ that is weakly
visible from a chord, given a subset $G$ of $P$'s vertices that guards $P$'s
boundary whose size is bounded by $c$ times the size of a minimum such subset.
  Our algorithms are based on an in-depth analysis of the geometric properties
of the regions that remain unguarded after placing guards at the vertices to
guard the polygon's boundary. It is plausible that our results will enable
Bhattacharya et al. to complete their grand attempt to prove the original
conjecture, as their approach is based on partitioning the underlying simple
polygon into a hierarchy of weakly visible polygons.

temperatures the post--AGB stars are the fundamental mode pulsators with period
decreasing as the star evolves from $\Pi\approx 300$ day to several days.

effective temperatures $T_\mathrm{eff} < 5000$K. The amplitude of bolometric

transition, and a triple point. These features remain largely unexplored and
the exact nature of the phase transitions is not clear due to very limited
control over the stress in bulk or film samples. Here, we show the synthesis of
single-crystal V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ nanoplates for the first time using chemical
vapor deposition via van der Waals epitaxy. Thickness of the V$_{2}$O$_{3}$
nanoplates range from a few to hundreds of nanometres and they can be
mechanically exfoliated from the growth substrate. Using Raman spectroscopy on
the nanoplates, we reveal that upon heating, V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ enters
supercritical state for both tensiley strained and relaxed crystals with
similar out-of-plane response. Transmission electron microscopy on V2O3
nanoplates hints the existence of a structural change when the crystals are
heated. Our results show that V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ nanoplates should be useful for
studying the physics of supercritical state and the phase stability of
V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ to enable new horizons in applications.

graphs $G=(V, E)$, i.e., in drawings where each edge is depicted as a line
segment. The respective decision problem is NP-hard [Bienstock, '91]. In
contrast to theory and the topological setting, the geometric setting did not
receive a lot of attention in practice. Prior work [Radermacher et al.,
ALENEX'18] is limited to the crossing-minimization in geometric graphs with
less than $200$ edges. The described heuristics base on the primitive operation
of moving a single vertex $v$ to its crossing-minimal position, i.e., the
position in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that minimizes the number of crossings on edges
incident to $v$.
  In this paper, we introduce a technique to speed-up the computation by a
factor of $20$. This is necessary but not sufficient to cope with graphs with a
few thousand edges. In order to handle larger graphs, we drop the condition
that each vertex $v$ has to be moved to its crossing-minimal position and
compute a position that is only optimal with respect to a small random subset
of the edges. In our theoretical contribution, we consider drawings that
contain for each edge $uv \in E$ and each position $p \in \mathbb{R}^2$ for $v$
$o(|E|)$ crossings. In this case, we prove that with a random subset of the
edges of size $\Theta(k \log k)$ the co-crossing number of a degree-$k$ vertex
$v$, i.e., the number of edge pairs $uv \in E, e \in E$ that do not cross, can
be approximated by an arbitrary but fixed factor $\delta$ with high
probability. In our experimental evaluation, we show that the randomized
approach reduces the number of crossings in graphs with up to $13\,000$ edges
considerably. The evaluation suggests that depending on the degree-distribution
different strategies result in the fewest number of crossings.

Darcy equations which model transitions between the fast flow in channels
(governed by Stokes equations) and the slow flow in porous media (governed by
Darcy's law). The numerical challenge for this model is the designing of a
numerical scheme which is stable for both the Stokes-dominated (high
permeability) and the Darcy-dominated (low permeability) equations. In this
paper, we solve the Brinkman model in $n$ dimensions ($n = 2, 3$) by using the
mixed discontinuous Galerkin (MDG) method, which meets this challenge. This MDG
method is based on the pseudostress-velocity formulation and uses a
discontinuous piecewise polynomial pair
$\underline{\bm{\mathcal{P}}}_{k+1}^{\mathbb{S}}$-$\bm{\mathcal{P}}_k$ $(k \geq
0)$, where the stress field is symmetric. The main unknowns are the
pseudostress and the velocity, whereas the pressure is easily recovered through
a simple postprocessing. A key step in the analysis is to establish the
parameter-robust inf-sup stability through specific parameter-dependent norms
at both continuous and discrete levels. Therefore, the stability results
presented here are uniform with respect to the permeability. Thanks to the
parameter-robust stability analysis, we obtain optimal error estimates for the
stress in broken $\underline{\bm{H}}(\bm{{\rm div}})$-norm and velocity in
$\bm{L}^2$-norm. Furthermore, the optimal $\underline{\bm{L}}^2$ error estimate
for pseudostress is derived under certain conditions. Finally, numerical
experiments are provided to support the theoretical results and to show the
robustness, accuracy, and flexibility of the MDG method.

character of these bands and fully map out their dispersion. We observe bands
in very good agreement with our cluster dynamical mean-field theory
calculations. We show that the J=1/2 band, the closest to the Fermi level Ef,
is dominated by dxz character along kx and dyz along ky. This is actually in
agreement with an isotropic J=1/2 character on average, but this large orbital
dependence in k-space was mostly overlooked before. It gives rise to strong
modulations of the ARPES intensity that we explain and carefully take into
account to compare dispersions in equivalent directions of the Brillouin zone.
Although the latter dispersions look different at first, suggesting possible
symmetry breakings, they are found essentially similar, once corrected for
these intensity variations. In particular, the pseudogap-like features close to
the $X$ point appearing in the nearly metallic 15% Rh-doped Sr2IrO4 strongly
depend on experimental conditions. We reveal that there is nevertheless an

mixing. INLA is implemented in the R package R-INLA, which represents a
user-friendly and versatile tool for doing Bayesian inference. R-INLA returns
posterior marginals for all model parameters and the corresponding posterior
summary information. Model choice criteria as well as predictive diagnostics

certain SAT-solving algorithms even when the number of available qubits is
significantly smaller than the number of variables. Here we generalise this
approach. We present a framework for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms which
utilise quantum computers significantly smaller than the problem size. Given an
arbitrarily small ratio of the quantum computer to the instance size, we
achieve polynomial speedups for classical divide-and-conquer algorithms,
provided that certain criteria on the time- and space-efficiency are met. We
demonstrate how this approach can be used to enhance Eppstein's algorithm for
the cubic Hamiltonian cycle problem, and achieve a polynomial speedup for any
ratio of the number of qubits to the size of the graph.

the Cheeger constant or edge expansion of a graph to higher dimensions. The
classical Cheeger inequality implies that for graphs edge expansion is
equivalent to spectral expansion. In higher dimensions this is not the case: a
simplicial complex can be spectrally expanding but not have high dimensional
edge-expansion. The phenomenon of high dimensional edge expansion in higher
dimensions is much more involved than spectral expansion, and is far from being
understood. In particular, prior to this work, the only known bounded degree
cosystolic expanders known were derived from the theory of buildings that is
far from being elementary.
  In this work we study high dimensional complexes which are {\em strongly
symmetric}. Namely, there is a group that acts transitively on top dimensional
cells of the simplicial complex [e.g., for graphs it corresponds to a group
that acts transitively on the edges]. Using the strong symmetry, we develop a
new machinery to prove coboundary and cosystolic expansion.

We analyse the structure of the critical curves in this $\text{Ra}-\alpha$

It is possible to accurately measure the masses of the white dwarfs
(WDs) in the Hyades cluster using gravitational redshift, because the radial
velocity of the stars can be obtained independently of spectroscopy from
astrometry and the cluster has a low velocity dispersion. Aims. We aim to
obtain an accurate measurement of the Hyades WD masses by determining the
mass-to-radius ratio (M/R) from the observed gravitational redshift, and to
compare them with masses derived from other methods. Methods. We analyse
archive high-resolution UVES-VLT spectra of six WDs belonging to the Hyades to
measure their Doppler shift, from which M/R is determined after subtracting the
astrometric radial velocity. We estimate the radii using Gaia photometry as
well as literature data. Results. The M/R error associated to the gravitational
redshift measurement is about 5%. The radii estimates, evaluated with different
methods, are in very good agreement, though they can differ by up to 4%
depending on the quality of the data. The masses based on gravitational
redshift are systematically smaller than those derived from other methods, by a
minimum of $\sim 0.02$ up to 0.05 solar masses. While this difference is within
our measurement uncertainty, the fact that it is systematic indicates a likely
real discrepancy between the different methods. Conclusions. We show that the
M/R derived from gravitational redshift measurements is a powerful tool to
determine the masses of the Hyades WDs and could reveal interesting properties
of their atmospheres. The technique can be improved by using dedicated
spectrographs, and can be extended to other clusters, making it unique in its
ability to accurately and empirically determine the masses of WDs in open
clusters. At the same time we prove that gravitational redshift in WDs agrees
with the predictions of stellar evolution models to within a few percent.

single-scanner dataset from the UK Biobank can be successfully applied to
segmenting cardiac MR images across different sites and different scanners
without substantial loss of accuracy. Specifically, the method was trained on a
large set of 3,975 subjects from the UK Biobank. It was then directly tested on
600 different subjects from the UK Biobank for intra-domain testing and two
other sets for cross-domain testing: the ACDC dataset (100 subjects, 1 site, 2

proposed method produces promising segmentation results on the UK Biobank test

also performing well on cross-domain test sets, achieving a mean Dice metric of

similar to the found soliton and having an energy larger than the critical
value. It is shown that the compression ratio weakly depends on the energy and
the number of cores and is approximately equal to 6 times with an energy
efficiency of almost 100\%. The use of longer laser pulses allows one to
increase the compression ratio up to 30-40 times with an energy efficiency of
more than 50\%. The obtained analytical estimates of the compression ratio and
its efficiency are in good agreement with the results of numerical simulation.

genetics and the Solar System's dynamical evolution. However, to unlock the
full potential of these anomalies for constraining the processing, mixing, and
transport of material in the disk it is essential to identify the main
components responsible for producing planetary-scale isotope variations, and to
investigate how they relate to the isotopic heterogeneity inherited from the
Solar System's parental molecular cloud. To address these issues we measured
the Ti and Sr isotopic compositions of Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) from the
Allende CV3 chondrite, as well as acid leachates and an insoluble residue from
the Murchison CM2 chondrite, and combine these results with literature data for
presolar grains, hibonites, chondrules, and bulk meteorites. Our analysis
reveals that the mineral-scale nebular isotopic heterogeneity as sampled by
leachates and presolar grains is largely decoupled from the planetary-scale
isotope anomalies. Combining isotope anomaly data for a large number of
elements reveals that the difference between non-carbonaceous (NC) and
carbonaceous (CC) meteorites is the product of mixing between NC material and a
nebular reservoir (termed IC) whose isotopic composition is similar to that of
CAIs, but whose chemical composition is similar to bulk chondrites. In our
preferred model, the distinct isotopic compositions of these two nebular
reservoirs reflect an inherited heterogeneity of the solar system's parental
molecular cloud core, which therefore has never been fully homogenized during
collapse. Planetary-scale isotopic anomalies are thus caused by variable mixing
of isotopically distinct primordial disk reservoirs, the selective processing
of these reservoirs in different nebular environments, and the heterogeneous
distribution of the thereby forming nebular products.

magnetization switching in heavy-metal/ferromagnetic-metal structures. The STT
efficiency defined by the ratio between the effective field due to STT and the

STT-based spintronic devices. In this work, using the harmonic Hall measurement
method, we experimentally studied the STT efficiency in platinum(Pt)/FM

strongly depends on the Pt thickness and reaches a maximum value of 4.259
mT/($10^6$A/$cm^{2}$) for the 1.8-nm-thickness Pt sample. This result indicates
that competition between spin Hall effect (SHE) and Rashba effect as well as

besides the spin current generation mechanisms in improvement of the STT
efficiency, which is helpful in designing STT-based devices.

rigged Hilbert spaces are complementary concepts that coexist together in a

Special functions serve as bases for infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces
supporting linear unitary irreducible representations of a given Lie group.
These representations are explicitly given by operators on the Hilbert space
$\mathcal H$ and the generators of the Lie algebra are represented by unbounded
self-adjoint operators. The action of these operators on elements of continuous
bases is often considered. These continuous bases do not make sense as vectors
in the Hilbert space, instead they are functionals on the dual space,
$\Phi^\times$, of a rigged Hilbert space, $\Phi\subset \mathcal H \subset
\Phi^\times$. As a matter of fact, rigged Hilbert spaces are the structures in
which both, discrete orthonormal and continuous bases may coexist. We define
the space of test vectors $\Phi$ and a topology on it at our convenience,
depending on the studied group. The generators of the Lie algebra can be often
continuous operators on $\Phi$ with its own topology, so that they admit
continuous extensions to the dual $\Phi^\times$ and, therefore, act on the
elements of the continuous basis. We have investigated this formalism to
various examples of interest in quantum mechanics. In particular, we have

  Wachter-Zeh proven that codes belonging to this family cannot be efficiently

gravitational collapse of cool, dense regions of the disk form fragments
largely composed of gas. During formation, disk fragments may attain increased
metallicities as they interact with the surrounding disk material, whether
through particle migration to pressure maxima or through mutual gravitational
interaction. In this paper, we investigate the ability of fragments to collect
and retain a significant solid component through gas-particle interactions in
high-resolution 3D self-gravitating shearing box simulations. The formation of
axissymmetric perturbations associated with gravitational instabilities allows
particles of intermediate sizes to concentrate through aerodynamic drag forces.
By the onset of fragmentation, the mass of local particle concentrations within
the fragment are comparable to that of the gas component and the sebsequent
gravitational collapse results in the formation of a solid core. We find that
these cores can be up to several tens of Earth masses, depending on grain size,
before the fragment center reaches temperatures which would sublimate solids.
The solid fraction and total mass of the fragment also depend on the
metallicity of the young parent protoplanetary disk, with higher initial
metallicities resulting in larger fragments and larger solid cores.
Additionally, the extended atmospheres of these soon-to-be gas giants or brown
dwarfs are occasionally enriched above the initial metallicity, provided no
solid core forms in the center and are otherwise lacking in heavier elements
when a core does form.

These Fermi arcs are the manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence in
topological matter and thus are analogous to the topological chiral surface
states of topological insulators. It has been shown that the latter, depending
on the smoothness of the surface, host massive Volkov-Pankratov(VP) states that
coexist with the chiral ones. Here, we investigate these VP states in the
framework of Weyl semimetals, namely their density of states and
magneto-optical response. We find the selection rules corresponding to optical
transitions which lead to anisotropic responses to external fields. In the
presence of a magnetic field parallel to the interface, the selection rules and
hence the poles of the response functions are mixed.

suboptimal global performance. To overcome this limitation, we model the online

expert information about decision history and from the process of maximising

the 300VW dataset, we show that the performance of our reinforcement key

Despite
significant advances have been made, most of the change detection methods fail
to work well in challenging scenes due to ubiquitous noise and interferences.
Nowadays, post-processing methods (e.g. MRF, and CRF) aiming to enhance the
binary change detection results still fall short of the requirements on
universality for distinctive scenes, applicability for different types of
detection methods, accuracy, and real-time performance. Inspired by the nature
of image filtering, which separates noise from pixel observations and recovers
the real structure of patches, we consider utilizing image filters to enhance
the detection masks. In this paper, we present an integrated filter which
comprises a weighted local guided image filter and a weighted spatiotemporal
tree filter. The spatiotemporal tree filter leverages the global spatiotemporal
information of adjacent video frames and meanwhile the guided filter carries
out local window filtering of pixels, for enhancing the coarse change detection
masks. The main contributions are three: (i) the proposed filter can make full
use of the information of the same object in consecutive frames to improve its
current detection mask by computations on a spatiotemporal minimum spanning
tree; (ii) the integrated filter possesses both advantages of local filtering
and global filtering; it not only has good edge-preserving property but also
can handle heavily textured and colorful foreground regions; and (iii) Unlike
some popular enhancement methods (MRF, and CRF) that require either a priori
background probabilities or a posteriori foreground probabilities for every
pixel to improve the coarse detection masks, our method is a versatile
enhancement filter that can be applied after many different types of change
detection methods, and is particularly suitable for video sequences.

observations by Buckley et al. showed that the polarimetric emission from the

periodically changing intensities. This periodic non-thermal emission is
thought to be powered by the highly magnetised ($ 5 \times 10^{8} $ G) white
dwarf that is spinning down. The morphology of the polarisation signal, namely
the position angle plotted against the phase angle, is similar to that seen in
many radio pulsars. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can fit the
traditional pulsar rotating vector model to the optical position angle. We used
a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo technique to find the best fit for the model
yielding a magnetic inclination angle of $\alpha =
(86.6^{+3.0}_{-2.8})^{\circ}$ and an observer angle of $\zeta =

Kubo conductivity of incommensurate bilayer heterostructures at finite
temperature. Firstly, we derive an expression for the large-body limit of
Kubo-Greenwood conductivity in terms of an integral of the conductivity
function with respect to a current-current correlation measure. We then observe
that the incommensurate structure can be exploited to decompose the
current-current correlation measure into local contribution and deduce an
approximation scheme which is exponentially convergent in terms of domain size.
Secondly, we analyze the cost of computing local conductivities via Chebyshev
approximation. Our main finding is that if the inverse temperature $\beta$ is
sufficiently small compared to the inverse relaxation time $\eta$, namely
$\beta \lesssim \eta^{-1/2}$, then the dominant computational cost is
$\mathcal{O}\bigl(\eta^{-3/2}\bigr)$ inner products for a suitably truncated
Chebyshev series, which significantly improves on the
$\mathcal{O}\bigl(\eta^{-2}\bigr)$ inner products required by a naive Chebyshev
approximation. Thirdly, we propose a rational approximation scheme for the low
temperature regime $\eta^{-1/2} \lesssim \beta$, where the cost of the
polynomial method increases up to $\mathcal{O}\bigl(\beta^2\bigr),$ but the
rational scheme scales much more mildly with respect to $\beta$.

remains controversial despite a long scientific history. The very small
friction measured on ice is classically attributed to the presence of a thin
self-lubricating film of meltwater between the slider and the ice. But while
the macroscale friction behavior of ice and snow has been widely investigated,
very little is known about the interfacial water film and its mechanical
properties. In this work, we develop a stroke-probe force measurement technique
to uncover the microscopic mechanisms underlying ice lubrication. We
simultaneously measure the shear friction of a bead on ice and quantify the
in-situ mechanical properties of the interfacial film, as well as its
thickness, under various regimes of speed and temperature. In contrast with
standard views, meltwater is found to exhibit a complex visco-elastic rheology,
with a viscosity up to two orders of magnitude larger than pristine water. The
non-conventional rheology of meltwater provides a new, consistent, rationale
for ice slipperiness. Hydrophobic coatings are furthermore shown to strongly
reduce friction due to a surprising change in the local viscosity, providing an
unexpected explanation for waxing effects in winter sports. Beyond ice
friction, our results suggest new avenues towards self-healing lubricants to
achieve ultra-low friction.

by hiding DNS resolutions from passive adversaries. Yet, past attacks have
shown that encrypted DNS is still sensitive to traffic analysis. As a
consequence, RFC 8467 proposes to pad messages prior to encryption, which
heavily reduces the characteristics of encrypted traffic. In this paper, we
show that padding alone is insufficient to counter DNS traffic analysis. We
propose a novel traffic analysis method that combines size and timing
information to infer the websites a user visits purely based on encrypted and
padded DNS traces. To this end, we model DNS sequences that capture the
complexity of websites that usually trigger dozens of DNS resolutions instead
of just a single DNS transaction. A closed world evaluation based on the Alexa
top-10k websites reveals that attackers can deanonymize at least half of the
test traces in 80.2% of all websites, and even correctly label all traces for
32.0% of the websites. Our findings undermine the privacy goals of
state-of-the-art message padding strategies in DoT/DoH. We conclude by showing
that successful mitigations to such attacks have to remove the entropy of
inter-arrival timings between query responses.

Remarkably, our domain-aware framework can specify scenarios in which domain

be cleanly defined and statically enforced. As a specific application, we
introduce domain-aware multiparty session types, in which global protocols can
express arbitrarily nested sub-protocols via domain migration. We develop a

correctness properties from the binary to the multiparty setting.

resolve this difficulty, we propose a new descent direction, namely Ideal

critical to theoretically understanding the cause of these issues. Previous
methods of modeling voids have involved removing atoms according to an {\it a

dynamics. We propose a new fast and unbiased approach based on the established
and efficient Wooten-Winer-Weaire (WWW) Monte Carlo method, by using a range of
fixed densities to generate equilibrium structures of $a$-Si and $a$-Si:H that
maintain 4-coordination. We find a smooth evolution in bond lengths, bond
angles, and bond angle deviations $\Delta \theta$ as the density is changed
around the equilibrium value of $4.9\times10^{22}\ $atoms/cm$^3$. However, a
significant change occurs at densities below $4.3\times10^{22}\ $atoms/cm$^3$,
where voids begin to form to relieve tensile stress, akin to a cavitation
process in liquids. We find both small voids (radius $\sim$3 \AA) and larger
ones (up to 7 \AA), which compare well with available experimental data. The
voids have an influence on atomic structure up to 4 \AA beyond the void surface
and are associated with decreasing structural order, measured by
$\Delta\theta$. We also observe an increasing medium-range dihedral order with
increasing density. Our method allows fast generation of statistical ensembles,
resembles a physical process during experimental deposition, and provides a set
of void structures for further studies of their effects on degradation, hole
mobility, two-level systems, thermal transport, and elastic properties.

which can strongly shrink small signals towards prior means while keeping large
signals unshrunk. Although such priors have been extensively discussed under
Gaussian responses, we intensively encounter count responses in practice in
which the previous knowledge of global-local shrinkage priors cannot be
directly imported. In this paper, we discuss global-local shrinkage priors for
analyzing sequence of counts. We provide sufficient conditions under which the
posterior mean keeps the observation as it is for very large signals, known as
tail robustness property. Then, we propose tractable priors to meet the derived
conditions approximately or exactly and develop an efficient posterior
computation algorithm for Bayesian inference. The proposed methods are free
from tuning parameters, that is, all the hyperparameters are automatically
estimated based on the data. We demonstrate the proposed methods through
simulation and an application to a real dataset.

suitable for the secrecy rate in physical layer security, but it does not
consider the performance of the legitimate and adversary users. In this paper,
we consider and analyze BEP for physical layer security systems because based
on it, the performance of the legitimate and adversary users are guaranteed and
it is needed to use lower power. BEP is calculated for the legitimate and
adversary users and it is shown that BEP can be better criterion for
performance evaluation of the physical layer security systems. Based on BEP,
the optimum transmit power is obtained and a new definition for outage
probability is proposed and obtained theoretically. Also, the proposed approach
is applied for adversary users with unknown mode and the cooperative adversary
users. Simulation results show that the proposed method needs more than 5dB
lower power for different scenarios.

that provide for each pixel of one image a probability distribution on
predefined classes. The predicted class is then usually obtained by the maximum
a-posteriori probability (MAP) which is known as Bayes rule in decision theory.
From decision theory we also know that the Bayes rule is optimal regarding the
simple symmetric cost function. Therefore, it weights each type of confusion
between two different classes equally, e.g., given images of urban street
scenes there is no distinction in the cost function if the network confuses a
person with a street or a building with a tree. Intuitively, there might be
confusions of classes that are more important to avoid than others. In this
work, we want to raise awareness of the possibility of explicitly defining
confusion costs and the associated ethical difficulties if it comes down to
providing numbers. We define two cost functions from different extreme
perspectives, an egoistic and an altruistic one, and show how safety relevant
quantities like precision / recall and (segment-wise) false positive / negative
rate change when interpolating between MAP, egoistic and altruistic decision
rules.

less than $2^{\aleph_0}$ values in $G$, the verbal subgroup $w(G)$ is finite.
Detomi, Morigi and Shumyatsky established that multilinear commutator words --
and the particular words $x^2$ and $[x^2,y]$ -- have the property that the
corresponding verbal subgroup is finite in a profinite group $G$ whenever the
word takes at most countably many values in $G$. They conjectured that, in
fact, this should be true for every word. In particular, their conjecture
included as open cases power words and Engel words.
  In the present paper, we take a new approach via parametrised words that
leads to stronger results. First we prove that multilinear commutator words are
strongly concise in the class of all profinite groups. Then we establish that
every group word is strongly concise in the class of nilpotent profinite
groups. From this we deduce, for instance, that, if $w$ is one of the group
words $x^2$, $x^3$, $x^6$, $[x^3,y]$ or $[x,y,y]$, then $w$ is strongly concise
in the class of all profinite groups. Indeed, the same conclusion can be
reached for all words of the infinite families $[x^m,z_1,\ldots,z_r]$ and

the kinetics of micro-droplet until the external field applied reaches a

emerged as a potential way to improve the representation of sub-grid processes
in Earth System Models (ESMs). So far, all studies were based on the same
three-step approach: first a training dataset was created from a
high-resolution simulation, then a machine learning algorithm was fitted to
this dataset, before the trained algorithm was implemented in the ESM. The
resulting online simulations were frequently plagued by instabilities and
biases. Here, coupled online learning is proposed as a way to combat these
issues. Coupled learning can be seen as a second training stage in which the
pretrained machine learning parameterization, specifically a neural network, is
run in parallel with a high-resolution simulation. The high-resolution
simulation is kept in sync with the neural network-driven ESM through constant
nudging. This enables the neural network to learn from the tendencies that the
high-resolution simulation would produce if it experienced the states the
neural network creates. The concept is illustrated using the Lorenz 96 model,
where coupled learning is able to recover the ""true"" parameterizations.
Further, detailed algorithms for the implementation of coupled learning in 3D
cloud-resolving models and the super parameterization framework are presented.
Finally, outstanding challenges and issues not resolved by this approach are

decomposition of energetic changes into heat and work. Contrary to classical
engines, the entropy change of the piston cannot be neglected in the quantum

desired task and the implied capabilities of the agent using the work generated
by the engine. Each work quantifier---from ergotropy to non-equilibrium free
energy---has well defined operational interpretations. We analyse these work
quantifiers for a heat-pumped three-level maser and derive the respective

engine efficiency converges towards the Scovil--Schulz-DuBois maser efficiency,

localization, the refined Witten index can be expressed as a residue integral
with a specific contour prescription, originally due to Jeffrey and Kirwan,

of quiver quantum mechanics describing interactions of BPS black holes predicts
that the refined Witten index of a non-Abelian quiver can be expressed as a sum
of indices for Abelian quivers, weighted by `single-centered invariants'. In
the case of quivers without oriented loops, we show that this decomposition
naturally arises from the residue formula, as a consequence of applying the
Cauchy-Bose identity to the vector multiplet contributions. For quivers with

dimensions associated with novelty such as arousal (surprise) and valence. The
model formalized arousal as Bayesian information gain and valence as a function
of arousal based on Berlyne's arousal potential theory. One becomes accustomed
to novelty by repeated exposure. This so-called habituation to novelty is
important in the design of long-term product experience. We herein propose a
mathematical model of habituation to novelty based on the emotional dimension
model. We formalized the habituation as a decrement in information gain from a
novel event through Bayesian update. We derived the information gained from the
repeated exposure of a novel stimulus as a function of three parameters:
initial prediction error, initial uncertainty, and noise of sensory stimulus.
With the proposed model, we discovered an interaction effect of the initial
prediction error and initial uncertainty on habituation. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a range of positive emotions on prediction errors shift toward
becoming more novel by repeated exposure.

stress tensor of the Liouville CFT on the complex plane restricted to the real
line. The same relation generalizes to the conformal abelian Toda theory:
boundary correlators of Toda scalars on AdS$_2$ are directly related to the
correlation functions of the chiral $\mathcal W$-symmetry generators in the
Toda CFT and thus are essentially controlled by the underlying
infinite-dimensional symmetry. These may be viewed as examples of
AdS$_2$/CFT$_1$ duality where the CFT$_1$ is the chiral half of a 2d CFT; we
shall refer to this as AdS$_{2}$/CFT$^{1/2}_{2}$. In this paper we demonstrate
that this duality applies also to the non-abelian Toda theory containing a
Liouville scalar coupled to a 2d $\sigma$-model originating from the $SL(2,

the chiral stress tensor $T$ while the other two scalars are dual to the

predictions, in general, agree well with experimental data. We find that the
phonon thermal conductivity is in the range of 2 - 18 $W/mK$, which accounts
for 1% - 40% of the total thermal conductivity. It is also found that the
phonon thermal conductivities in transition metals and
transition-intermetallic-compounds (TICs) are non-negligible compared to noble
metals due to their high phonon group velocities. Besides, the electron-phonon
coupling effect on phonon thermal conductivity in transition metals and
intermetallic compounds is stronger than that of nobles, which is attributed to
the larger electron-phonon coupling constant with a high electron density of
state within Fermi window and high phonon frequency. The noble metals have
higher electron thermal conductivities compared to transition metals and TICs,
which is mainly due to the weak electron-phonon coupling in noble metals. It is
also shown that the Lorenz ratios of transition metals and
transition-intermetallic-compounds hold larger deviations from the Sommerfeld
value $L_0=2.44 \times 10^{-8} W \Omega K^{-2}$. We also find the mean free

Additionally, the high intra- and inter-observer variability in grading can
result in over- and undertreatment of prostate cancer. Artificial intelligence
(AI) methods may alleviate these problems by assisting pathologists to reduce
workload and harmonize grading.
  Methods: We digitized 6,682 needle biopsies from 976 participants in the
population based STHLM3 diagnostic study to train deep neural networks for
assessing prostate biopsies. The networks were evaluated by predicting the
presence, extent, and Gleason grade of malignant tissue for an independent test
set comprising 1,631 biopsies from 245 men. We additionally evaluated grading
performance on 87 biopsies individually graded by 23 experienced urological
pathologists from the International Society of Urological Pathology. We
assessed discriminatory performance by receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
and tumor extent predictions by correlating predicted millimeter cancer length
against measurements by the reporting pathologist. We quantified the
concordance between grades assigned by the AI and the expert urological
pathologists using Cohen's kappa.
  Results: The performance of the AI to detect and grade cancer in prostate
needle biopsy samples was comparable to that of international experts in
prostate pathology. The AI achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.997 for
distinguishing between benign and malignant biopsy cores, and 0.999 for
distinguishing between men with or without prostate cancer. The correlation
between millimeter cancer predicted by the AI and assigned by the reporting
pathologist was 0.96. For assigning Gleason grades, the AI achieved an average
pairwise kappa of 0.62. This was within the range of the corresponding values
for the expert pathologists (0.60 to 0.73).

of different applications. Extracting the interpretable and physically
meaningful parameters for such applications, however, requires solving an
inverse problem in which a model function determined by these parameters needs
to be fitted to the measured data. Since the underlying optimization problem is
nonconvex and very costly to solve, we propose learning the prediction of
suitable parameters from the measured data directly. More precisely, we develop
a model-based autoencoder in which the encoder network predicts suitable
parameters and the decoder is fixed to a physically meaningful model function,
such that we can train the encoding network in an unsupervised way. We
illustrate numerically that the resulting network is more than 140 times faster
than classical optimization techniques while making predictions with only
slightly higher objective values. Using such predictions as starting points of
local optimization techniques allows us to converge to better local minima
about twice as fast as optimization without the network-based initialization.

nonlinear elasticity for phase transitions. We study appropriate numerical
approximations based on the discontinuous Galerkin treatment of higher
gradients and used succesfully in numerical simulations of experiments. We show
that the discrete minimizers converge in the limit to minimizers of the
continuous problem. This is achieved by employing the theory of
$\Gamma$-convergence of the approximate energy functionals to the continuous
model when the discretization parameter tends to zero. The analysis is involved
due to the structure of numerical approximations which are defined in spaces
with lower regularity than the space where the minimizers of the continuous
variational problem are sought. This fact leads to the development of a new
approach to $\Gamma$-convergence, appropriate for discontinuous finite element
discretizations, which can be applied to quite general energy minimization
problems. Furthermore, the adoption of exponential terms penalising the
interpenetration of matter requires a new framework based on Orlicz spaces for
discontinuous Galerkin methods which is developed in this paper as well.

obtains a new stochastic process with different properties. We apply this idea

particles on their individual motility. Using the effective process formalism
from dynamical large deviations theory, we derive the interactions that actuate
the imposed mobility against jamming interactions in two toy models---the
totally asymmetric exclusion process and run-and-tumble particles, \emil{in the
case of two or three particles}. We provide a framework which takes into
account the energy-consumption required for self-propulsion, and address the
question of how energy-efficient the emergent interactions are. Upon
conditioning, run-and-tumble particles develop an alignment interaction and
achieve a higher gain in efficiency than TASEP particles. A point of
diminishing returns in efficiency is reached beyond a certain level of
conditioning. With recourse to a general formula for the change in energy
efficiency upon conditioning, we conclude that the most significant gains occur
when there are large fluctuations in mobility to exploit. From a detailed
comparison of the emergent effective interaction in a two- versus a three-body
scenario, we discover evidence of a screening effect which suggests that
conditioning can produce topological rather than metric interactions.

most existing works rely on a low-dimensional (LD) partitioning of the
geometrical model. While this exploits the geometry of the heart, it is of

bridges the gap of previous works by introducing an expressive generative model

order to look for acoustic modes during the survey phase of the Kepler mission.
Solar-like oscillations have been detected in about 540 stars. The question of
why no oscillations were detected in the remaining stars is still open.
Previous works explained the non-detection of modes with the high level of
magnetic activity. However, the studied stars contained some classical
pulsators and red giants that could have biased the results. In this work, we
revisit this analysis on a cleaner sample of 1,014 main-sequence solar-like
stars. First we compute the predicted amplitude of the modes. We find that the
stars with detected modes have an amplitude to noise ratio larger than 0.94. We
measure reliable rotation periods and the associated photometric magnetic index
for 684 stars and in particular for 323 stars where the mode amplitude is
predicted to be high enough to be detected. We find that among these 323 stars
32% have a magnetic activity level larger than the Sun at maximum activity,
explaining the non-detection of p modes. Interestingly, magnetic activity
cannot be the primary reason responsible for the absence of detectable modes in
the remaining 68% of the stars without p modes detected and with reliable
rotation periods. Thus, we investigate metallicity, inclination angle, and
binarity as possible causes of low mode amplitudes. Using spectroscopic
observations for a subsample, we find that a low metallicity could be the
reason for suppressed modes. No clear correlation with binarity nor inclination
is found. We also derive the lower limit for our photometric activity index (of
20-30 ppm) below which rotation and magnetic activity are not detected. Finally
with our analysis we conclude that stars with a photometric activity index
larger than 2,000 ppm have 98.3% probability of not having oscillations
detected.

  In this paper, we present a simple and effective method of extracting new

system discovers, ranks and presents the most salient patterns to domain
experts in an interpretable form. By marking patterns as compatible with the
desired relationship type, experts indirectly batch-annotate candidate pairs
whose relationship is expressed with such patterns in the literature. Even with
a complete absence of seed data, experts are able to discover thousands of
high-quality pairs with the desired relationship within minutes. When a small
number of relevant pairs do exist - even when their relationship is more
general (e.g. gene X is biologically associated with disease Y) than the
relationship of interest - our system leverages them in order to i) learn a
better ranking of the patterns to be annotated or ii) generate weakly labelled
pairs in a fully automated manner.

completion task, and show that it is an effective way of constructing knowledge

Implementations of microwave optomechanics to date have coupled microwave

limitations on the maximum achievable coupling strength. Here, we
experimentally implement a fundamentally different approach: flux-mediated
optomechanical coupling. In this scheme, mechanical displacements modulate the
flux in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) that forms the
inductor of a microwave resonant circuit. We demonstrate that this
flux-mediated coupling can be tuned in-situ by the magnetic flux in the SQUID,
enabling nanosecond flux tuning of the optomechanical coupling. Tuning the
external in-plane magnetic transduction field, we observe a linear scaling of
the single-photon coupling strength, reaching rates comparable to the current
state-of-the-art. Finally, this linear scaling is predicted to overcome the
limits of single-photon coupling rates in capacitive optomechanics, opening the
door for a new generation of groundbreaking optomechanical experiments in the
single-photon strong coupling regime.

study the one- and two- triplon signal considering experimental scattering
geometry, polarization restriction, and experimental resolution effects. Our
calculations find an additional contribution to the two-triplon RIXS signal,
not previously reported in the literature, that originates from the local
hard-core dimer constraint. This leads to a finite non-zero signal at the (0,0)
momentum transfer which can offer an explanation for the existing ladder RIXS
experiments and also predicts a non-zero signal for the two-dimensional quantum
dimer system. We find that the $L_3$ edge RIXS response of the one- and

galaxies. This is an important piece of information that could allow us to
probe the physics of structure formation as well as testing the underlying
theory of gravity. The slingshot effect, a special case of the Integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect, is expected to create dipole signals in the temperature
fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB). This effect
creates a hot spot behind and a cold spot in front of moving massive objects.
The dipole signal created by the slingshot effect can be used to measure
transverse velocities, but because the signal is expected to be weak, the
effect has not been measured yet. The aim is to show that the slingshot effect
can be measured by stacking the signals of galaxies falling into a collapsing
cluster. We evaluate if the effect can probe modified gravity. We use data from
a simulated galaxy catalogue (MDPL2) to mimic observations. We identify a
massive galaxy cluster, and make maps of the slingshot effect around infalling
galaxies. We add uncorrelated Gaussian noise to each map. The maps are rotated
according to the direction to the cluster centre, such that the dipole signal
will add up constructively when stacking. We compare each stack to a dipole
stencil and we find the probability for a false positive in the absence of the
slingshot signal. Each galaxy gives a signal of around $\Delta T/T \approx
10^{-9}$, while the precision of CMB experiments of today are $\Delta T/T
\approx 4 \times 10^{-6}$. By stacking around 10 000 galaxies, the slingshot
signal can be over the detectable threshold with experiments of today. However,
future CMB experiments must be used to be certain of the strength of the

an anchor region is detected through a convolutional neural network (CNN) with

detected anchor area is then fed into a light weighted regression network to
obtain the final cropping result. Unlike the conventional methods that multiple

is produced in our model, which is mapped to the final output directly. Thus,
low computational resources are required for the proposed approach. The

"1907.01433","Alaa Maalouf","Alaa Maalouf, Adiel Statman, Dan Feldman","Tight Sensitivity Bounds For Smaller Coresets",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An $\varepsilon$-coreset for Least-Mean-Squares (LMS) of a matrix
$A\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n\times d}$ is a small weighted subset of its rows that
approximates the sum of squared distances from its rows to every affine
$k$-dimensional subspace of ${\mathbb{R}}^d$, up to a factor of
$1\pm\varepsilon$.
  Such coresets are useful for hyper-parameter tuning and solving many
least-mean-squares problems such as low-rank approximation ($k$-SVD), $k$-PCA,
Lassso/Ridge/Linear regression and many more. Coresets are also useful for
handling streaming, dynamic and distributed big data in parallel. With high
probability, non-uniform sampling based on upper bounds on what is known as
importance or sensitivity of each row in $A$ yields a coreset. The size of the
(sampled) coreset is then near-linear in the total sum of these sensitivity
bounds.
  We provide algorithms that compute provably \emph{tight} bounds for the
sensitivity of each input row.
  It is based on two ingredients: (i) iterative algorithm that computes the
exact sensitivity of each point up to arbitrary small precision for
(non-affine) $k$-subspaces, and (ii) a general reduction of independent
interest from computing sensitivity for the family of affine $k$-subspaces in
${\mathbb{R}}^d$ to (non-affine) $(k+1)$- subspaces in ${\mathbb{R}}^{d+1}$.
  Experimental results on real-world datasets, including the English Wikipedia
documents-term matrix, show that our bounds provide significantly smaller and
data-dependent coresets also in practice. Full open source is also provided.

  for quasilinear elliptic equations with applications","30 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the aim of our work is to establish global weighted gradient
estimates via fractional maximal functions and the point-wise regularity
estimates of Dirichlet problem for divergence elliptic equations of the type
\begin{align*} \mathrm{div}(A(x,\nabla u)) = \mathrm{div}(f) \ \text{in} \
\Omega, \mbox{ and } \ u = g \ \text{on} \ \partial \Omega, \end{align*} that
related to Riesz potentials. Here, in our setting, $\Omega \subset
\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \ge 2$ is a bounded Reifenberg flat domain (that its boundary
is sufficiently flat in sense of Reifenberg) and the small-BMO condition (small
bounded mean oscillations) is assumed on the nonlinearity $A$. Further, the
emphasis of the paper is the existence of weak solution to a class of
quasilinear elliptic equations containing Riesz potential of the gradient term,
as an application of the global point-wise bound. And regarding this study, we
also analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee the
existence of solution to such nonlinear elliptic problems.

the workshop ""$\alpha_s$(2019): Precision measurements of the strong coupling""
held at ECT* (Trento) in Feb. 11--15, 2019. The workshop explored in depth the
latest developments on the determination of the QCD coupling $\alpha_s$ from
the key categories where high precision measurements are available: (i) lattice
QCD, (ii) hadronic $\tau$ decays, (iii) deep-inelastic scattering and parton
distribution functions, (iv) event shapes, jet cross sections, and other
hadronic final-states in $e^+e^-$ collisions, (v) Z boson and W boson hadronic
decays, and (vi) hadronic final states in p-p collisions. The status of the
current theoretical and experimental uncertainties associated to each
extraction method, and future perspectives were thoroughly reviewed. Novel
$\alpha_s$ determination approaches were discussed, as well as the combination
method used to obtain a world-average value of the QCD coupling at the Z mass
pole.

central challenge in operationalizing their approach is the difficulty in
eliciting a human specification of a similarity metric. In this paper, we
propose an operationalization of individual fairness that does not rely on a
human specification of a distance metric. Instead, we propose novel approaches
to elicit and leverage side-information on equally deserving individuals to
counter subordination between social groups. We model this knowledge as a
fairness graph, and learn a unified Pairwise Fair Representation (PFR) of the
data that captures both data-driven similarity between individuals and the
pairwise side-information in fairness graph. We elicit fairness judgments from
a variety of sources, including human judgments for two real-world datasets on
recidivism prediction (COMPAS) and violent neighborhood prediction (Crime &
Communities). Our experiments show that the PFR model for operationalizing
individual fairness is practically viable.

relies on considering its decay products with a finite experimental spectral
mass resolution which is typically $\Delta m \ge 2 $MeV and much larger than
its alleged binding energy, $B_X=0.00(18)$MeV. On the other hand, we have found
recently that there is a neat cancellation in the $1^{++}$ channel for the
invariant $D \bar D^*$ mass around the threshold between the continuum and
bound state contribution. This is very much alike a similar cancellation in the
proton-neutron continuum with the deuteron in the $1^{++}$ channel. Based on
comparative fits of experimental cross section deuteron and $X(3872)$ prompt
production in pp collisions data with a finite $p_T$ to a common Tsallis
distribution we find a strong argument questioning the bound state nature of
the state but also explaining the large observed production rate likely
consistent with a half-bound state.

have analyzed 98 gamma-ray bursts using an unmodeled search method that
searches for generic transient gravitational waves and 42 with a modeled search
method that targets compact-binary mergers as progenitors of short gamma-ray
bursts. Both methods clearly detect the previously reported binary merger
signal GW170817, with p-values of $<9.38 \times 10^{-6}$ (modeled) and $3.1
\times 10^{-4}$ (unmodeled). We do not find any significant evidence for
gravitational-wave signals associated with the other gamma-ray bursts analyzed,
and therefore we report lower bounds on the distance to each of these, assuming
various source types and signal morphologies. Using our final modeled search
results, short gamma-ray burst observations, and assuming binary neutron star
progenitors, we place bounds on the rate of short gamma-ray bursts as a
function of redshift for $z \leq 1$. We estimate 0.07-1.80 joint detections

differential forms on a Riemannian manifold that is Euclidean at infinity. The
manifold may have several boundary components caused by obstacles at which
relative boundary conditions are imposed. Scattering takes place because of the
presence of these obstacles and possible non-trivial topology and geometry.
Unlike in the case of functions eigenvalues generally exist at the bottom of
the continuous spectrum and the corresponding eigenforms represent cohomology
classes. We show that these eigenforms appear in the expansion of the
resolvent, the scattering matrix, and the spectral measure in terms of the
spectral parameter $\lambda$ near zero, and we determine the first terms in
this expansion explicitly. In dimension two an additional cohomology class
appears as a resonant state in the presence of an obstacle. In even dimensions
the expansion is in terms of $\lambda$ and $\log \lambda$. The theory of Hahn
holomorphic functions is used to describe these expansions effectively. We also
give a Birman-Krein formula in this context. The case of one forms with
relative boundary conditions has direct applications in physics as it describes
the scattering of electromagnetic waves.

controlled by the geometry of the mirror. Intuitive analytic descriptions of
the ""leaky"" and closed TCPCs are presented, and two specific designs--one for

mildly ionised gas outflowing with velocities of a few hundred to a few
thousand kilometres per second. These slow velocities imply a large launch
radius, pointing to the broad line region and/or torus as the origin of this
material. Thermal driving was originally suggested as a plausible mechanism for
launching this material but recent work has focused instead on magnetic winds,
unifying these slow, mildly ionised winds with the more highly ionised
ultra-fast outflows. Here we use the recently developed quantitative models for
thermal winds in black hole binary systems to predict the column density,
velocity and ionisation state from AGN. Thermal winds are sensitive to the
spectral energy distribution (SED), so we use realistic models for SEDs which
change as a function of mass and mass accretion rate, becoming X-ray weaker
(and hence more disc dominated) at higher Eddington ratio. These models allow
us to predict the launch radius, velocity, column density and ionisation state
of thermal winds as well as the mass loss rate and energetics. While these
match well to some of the observed properties of warm absorbers, the data point
to the presence of additional wind material, most likely from dust driving.

probe the fraction $f$ of dark mater in the form of Primordial Black Holes.
Here, we consider the merger rate of PBH binaries, accounting for the effect of
cosmological perturbations on their initial eccentricity $e$. The torque on the
binaries receives significant contributions from a wide range of scales, that
goes from the size of the horizon at the time when the binary forms, down to
the co-moving size of the binary. In scenarios where PBH are formed from
adiabatic perturbations, it is natural to expect an enhancement of the power
spectrum $P_\Phi$ at small scales, where it is poorly constrained
observationally. The effect can then be quite significant. For instance, a
nearly flat spectrum with amplitude $P_\Phi \gtrsim 10^{-7}$ on scales smaller
than $\sim 10 Mpc^{-1}$ gives a contribution $\langle j^2 \rangle \sim 10^3
P_\Phi$, where $j= (1-e^2)^{1/2}$ is the dimensionless angular momentum
parameter of the binaries. This contribution can dominate over tidal torques
from neighboring PBHs for any value of $f$. Current constraints allow for a
power spectrum as large as $P_\Phi \sim 10^{-5}$ at the intermediate scales
$10^3-10^5 Mpc^{-1}$, comparable to the co-moving size of the binaries at the
time of formation. In particular, this can relax current bounds on the PBH
abundance based on the observed LIGO/Virgo merger rate, allowing for a fraction
$f\sim 10\%$ of dark matter in PBH of mass $\sim 30 M_\odot$. We investigate
the differential merger rate $\Delta\Gamma(m_1,m_2)$, as a function of the
masses of the binary components, and the corresponding ``universality""
coefficient $\alpha = -(m_1+m_2)^2 \partial^2 \ln \Delta\Gamma/\partial
m_1\partial m_2$, concluding that merger rates may provide valuable information
on the spectrum of primordial cosmological perturbations at currently uncharted
lengthscales.

computational mass spectrometry community (Elias and Gygi, 2007). Recently, the
approach has gained significant popularity in other fields after Barber and
Candes (2015) laid its theoretical foundation in a more general setting that
included the feature selection problem. In both cases, the competition is based
on a head-to-head comparison between an observed score and a corresponding
decoy / knockoff. Keich and Noble (2017b) recently demonstrated some advantages
of using multiple rather than a single decoy when addressing the problem of
assigning peptide sequences to observed mass spectra. In this work, we consider
a related problem -- detecting peptides based on a collection of mass spectra
-- and we develop a new framework for competition-based FDR control using
multiple null scores. Within this framework, we offer several methods, all of
which are based on a novel procedure that rigorously controls the FDR in the
finite sample setting. Using real data to study the peptide detection problem
we show that, relative to existing single-decoy methods, our approach can
increase the number of discovered peptides by up to 50% at small FDR
thresholds.

from known sources embedded in the noise. In the Gaussian case the noise is
assumed to be the realization of a Gaussian random field (GRF). The most
important property of the MF, the maximization of the probability of detection
subject to a constant probability of false detection or false alarm (PFA),
makes it one of the most popular techniques. However, the MF technique relies
upon the a priori knowledge of the number and the position of the searched
signals in the GRF which usually are not available. A typical way out is to
assume that the position of a signal coincides with one of the peaks in the
matched filtered data. A detection is claimed when the probability that a given
peak is due only to the noise (i.e. the PFA) is smaller than a prefixed
threshold. In this case the probability density function (PDF) of the
amplitudes has to be used for the computation of the PFA, which is different
from the Gaussian. Moreover, the probability that a detection is false depends
on the number of peaks present in the filtered GRF, the greater the number of
peaks in a GRF, the higher the probability of peaks due to the noise that
exceed the detection threshold. If not taken into account, the PFA can be
severely underestimated. Many solutions proposed to this problem are
non-parametric hence not able to exploit all the available information. This
limitation has been overcome by means of two efficient parametric approaches,
one based on the PDF of the peak amplitudes of a smooth and isotropic GRF
whereas the other uses the Gumbel distribution (the asymptotic PDF of the
corresponding extreme). Simulations and ALMA maps show that, although the two
methods produce almost identical results, the first is more flexible and allows
us to check the reliability of the detection procedure.

generalization of standard Bayesian inference that only relies on a loss
function connecting the unknown parameters to the data. It is particularly
useful when the true data generating mechanism (or noise distribution) is
unknown or difficult to specify. The Gibbs posterior coincides with Bayesian
updating when a true likelihood function is known and the loss function
corresponds to the negative log-likelihood, yet provides subjective inference
in more general settings.
  We employ a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approach to approximate the Gibbs
posterior using particles. To manage the computational cost of propagating
increasing numbers of particles through the loss function, we employ a recently
developed local reduced basis method to build an efficient surrogate loss
function that is used in the Gibbs update formula in place of the true loss. We
derive error bounds for our approximation and propose an adaptive approach to

the emergence of Maturity Models in the 1970s with initial approach by Nolan.
The broad adoption of Maturity Models that followed through the success of the

high-resolution 3D reconstruction of proteins and other biological
macromolecules. An important challenge in cryo-EM is the reconstruction of
non-rigid molecules with parts that move and deform. Traditional reconstruction
methods fail in these cases, resulting in smeared reconstructions of the moving
parts. This poses a major obstacle for structural biologists, who need
high-resolution reconstructions of entire macromolecules, moving parts
included. To address this challenge, we present a new method for the
reconstruction of macromolecules exhibiting continuous heterogeneity. The
proposed method uses projection images from multiple viewing directions to
construct a graph Laplacian through which the manifold of three-dimensional
conformations is analyzed. The 3D molecular structures are then expanded in a
basis of Laplacian eigenvectors, using a novel generalized tomographic
reconstruction algorithm to compute the expansion coefficients. These
coefficients, which we name spectral volumes, provide a high-resolution
visualization of the molecular dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis and
evaluate the method empirically on several simulated data sets.

$\Delta_0^l=1.78$ k$_\mathrm{B}T_c$, with a weight of almost 90\%, is slightly
higher than that expected from the BCS theory in the weak-coupling case. The
multigap feature, rather unusal for an almost elemental superconductor, is
further supported by the field-dependent specific-heat coefficient, the
temperature dependence of the upper critical field, as well as by electronic
band-structure calculations. The absence of spontaneous magnetic fields below

quantum optics. Traditional IQ- or phase-amplitude modulators shape light by
carving energy from the input lightwave and are thus fundamentally lossy, and
cannot apply independent modulation to multiple input wavelengths
simultaneously. Taking inspiration from the space-time duality, we produce
arbitrary unitary spectro-temporal transformations on multiple temporal input
vectors with a modulation structure comprising of only lossless phase
modulation and dispersive allpass filtering. The bandwidth of the output
waveforms is not restricted by the driving electronics and independent
transformations can be performed simultaneously on multiple orthogonal inputs
such as spectrally separated frequency tones. This overcomes the main
limitations of traditional electro-optic modulators and offers fundamental new
insight into temporal wave manipulation.

creating multicasting opportunities among distinct requests.
  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems require downlink
channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) to better utilize the
available spatial diversity and multiplexing gains. However, in a frequency
division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO system, the huge CSI feedback overhead
becomes restrictive and degrades the overall spectral efficiency. In this
paper, we propose a deep learning based channel state matrix compression
scheme, called DeepCMC, composed of convolutional layers followed by
quantization and entropy coding blocks. In comparison with previous works, the
main contributions of DeepCMC are two-fold: i) DeepCMC is fully convolutional,
and it can be used in a wide range of scenarios with various numbers of
sub-channels and transmit antennas; ii) DeepCMC includes quantization and
entropy coding blocks and minimizes a cost function that accounts for both the
rate of compression and the reconstruction quality of the channel matrix at the
BS. Simulation results demonstrate that DeepCMC significantly outperforms the
state of the art compression schemes in terms of the reconstruction quality of
the channel state matrix for the same compression rate, measured in bits per
channel dimension.

techniques attracted attention enormously. One of the most important
applications in the computer vision community is human activity recognition. In
order to recognize human activities, we propose a human body parts tracking
system that tracks human body parts such as head, torso, arms and legs in order
to perform activity recognition tasks in real time. This thesis presents a
real-time human body parts tracking system (i.e. HBPT) from video sequences.
Our body parts model is mostly represented by body components such as legs,
head, torso and arms. The body components are modeled using torso location and
size which are obtained by a torso tracking method in each frame. In order to
track the torso, we are using a blob tracking module to find the approximate
location and size of the torso in each frame. By tracking the torso, we will be
able to track other body parts based on their location with respect to the
torso on the detected silhouette. In the proposed method for human body part
tracking, we are also using a refining module to improve the detected
silhouette by refining the foreground mask (i.e. obtained by background
subtraction) in order to detect the body parts with respect to torso location
and size. Having found the torso size and location, the region of each human
body part on the silhouette will be modeled by a 2D-Gaussian blob in each frame
in order to show its location, size and pose. The proposed approach described
in this thesis tracks accurately the body parts in different illumination
conditions and in the presence of partial occlusions. The proposed approach is
applied to activity recognition tasks such as approaching an object, carrying
an object and opening a box or suitcase.

pedestrians often do not carry hand-held devices (e.g., Dedicated short-range

vehicles nearby. To overcome this limitation, in this study, traffic cameras at
a signalized intersection were used to accurately detect and locate pedestrians
via a vision-based deep learning technique to generate safety alerts in
real-time about possible conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. The
contribution of this paper lies in the development of a system using a
vision-based deep learning model that is able to generate personal safety
messages (PSMs) in real-time (every 100 milliseconds). We develop a pedestrian
alert safety system (PASS) to generate a safety alert of an imminent
pedestrian-vehicle crash using generated PSMs to improve pedestrian safety at a
signalized intersection. Our approach estimates the location and velocity of a
pedestrian more accurately than existing DSRC-enabled pedestrian hand-held
devices. A connected vehicle application, the Pedestrian in Signalized
Crosswalk Warning (PSCW), was developed to evaluate the vision-based PASS.
Numerical analyses show that our vision-based PASS is able to satisfy the
accuracy and latency requirements of pedestrian safety applications in a
connected vehicle environment.

online revenue management problem where the insurance company looks to set
prices to optimize the long-run revenue from selling a new insurance product.
We develop two pricing models: an adaptive Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and
an adaptive Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. Both balance between
exploration, where we choose prices in order to learn the distribution of
demands & claims for the insurance product, and exploitation, where we
myopically choose the best price from the information gathered so far. The
performance of the pricing policies is measured in terms of regret: the
expected revenue loss caused by not using the optimal price. As is commonplace
in insurance, we model demand and claims by GLMs. In our adaptive GLM design,
we use the maximum quasi-likelihood estimation (MQLE) to estimate the unknown
parameters. We show that, if prices are chosen with suitably decreasing
variability, the MQLE parameters eventually exist and converge to the correct
values, which in turn implies that the sequence of chosen prices will also
converge to the optimal price. In the adaptive GP regression model, we sample
demand and claims from Gaussian Processes and then choose selling prices by the
upper confidence bound rule. We also analyze these GLM and GP pricing
algorithms with delayed claims. Although similar results exist in other
domains, this is among the first works to consider dynamic pricing problems in
the field of insurance. We also believe this is the first work to consider
Gaussian Process regression in the context of insurance pricing. These initial
findings suggest that online machine learning algorithms could be a fruitful
area of future investigation and application in insurance.
