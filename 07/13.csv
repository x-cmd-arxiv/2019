[0,1]}$ of the form $f_t=t\cdot f$ where $f\colon [0,1]\to [0,1]$ is unimodal,
$f(0)=f(1)=0$, $f(c)=1$ is of the form and $$f(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1-K_-|x-c|+o(|x-c|)& \mbox{ for }x<c, \\ 1-K_+|x-c|^\beta + o(|x-c|^\beta)

that such a family contains a Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser $2^\infty$ map, and
develop a renormalization theory for these maps. The scalings of the
renormalization intervals of the $2^\infty$ map turn out to be
super-exponential and non-universal (i.e. to depend on the map) and the
scaling-law is different for odd and even steps of the renormalization. The
conjugacy between the attracting Cantor sets of two such maps is smooth if and
only if some invariant is satisfied. We also show that the
Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser map does not have wandering intervals, but
surprisingly we were only able to prove this using our rather detailed scaling
results.

applications to various domains, such as video surveillance, risk assessment,

fact that such time series are usually non stationary and highly dimensional.
However, modern machine learning techniques provide robust approaches for
data-driven modeling and critical information extraction. In this paper, we
propose a Sequence to Sequence architecture for real-time detection of
anomalies in human trajectories, in the context of risk-based security. Our
detection scheme is tested on a synthetic dataset of diverse and realistic
trajectories generated by the ISL iCrowd simulator. The experimental results
indicate that our scheme accurately detects motion patterns that deviate from
normal behaviors and is promising for future real-world applications.

$p$-th moment $\|\mathcal{X}\|_p^p = \sum_{i=1}^n |\mathcal{X}_i|^p$ of an
underlying vector $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, which is presented as a
sequence of poly$(n)$ updates to its coordinates. Of particular interest is
when $p \in (0,2]$. Although a tight space bound of $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2} \log
n)$ bits is known for this problem when both positive and negative updates are
allowed, surprisingly there is still a gap in the space complexity when all
updates are positive. Specifically, the upper bound is $O(\epsilon^{-2} \log
n)$ bits, while the lower bound is only $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2} + \log n)$ bits.
Recently, an upper bound of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2} + \log n)$ bits was
obtained assuming that the updates arrive in a random order.
  We show that for $p \in (0, 1]$, the random order assumption is not needed.
Namely, we give an upper bound for worst-case streams of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2} + \log n)$ bits for estimating $\|\mathcal{X}\|_p^p$.
Our techniques also give new upper bounds for estimating the empirical entropy
in a stream. On the other hand, we show that for $p \in (1,2]$, in the natural
coordinator and blackboard communication topologies, there is an
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ bit max-communication upper bound based on a
randomized rounding scheme. Our protocols also give rise to protocols for heavy
hitters and approximate matrix product. We generalize our results to arbitrary
communication topologies $G$, obtaining an $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{2} \log d)$
max-communication upper bound, where $d$ is the diameter of $G$. Interestingly,
our upper bound rules out natural communication complexity-based approaches for
proving an $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2} \log n)$ bit lower bound for $p \in (1,2]$ for
streaming algorithms. In particular, any such lower bound must come from a
topology with large diameter.

crewed missions both in and beyond low-Earth orbit, it is essential to the
science community to agree on universal standards of safety, mission assurance,
planetary protection, and especially anti-colonization. These issues will
impact all areas of space science. Examples that are particularly relevant to
the Astro2020 Decadal Survey include but are not limited to: light pollution

moving international space law and domestic space policy from a reactive nature

topological order, which is instead characterized by intricate patterns of
entanglement. A paradigmatic example of such topological order is the Laughlin
state, which minimizes the interaction energy of charged particles in a
magnetic field and underlies the fractional quantum Hall effect. Broad efforts
have arisen to enhance our understanding of these orders by forming Laughlin
states in synthetic quantum systems, such as those composed of ultracold atoms

only physical system in which topological order has appeared. Here, we present
the first observation of optical photon pairs in the Laughlin state. These
pairs emerge from a photonic analog of a fractional quantum Hall system, which
combines strong, Rydberg-mediated interactions between photons and synthetic
magnetic fields for light, induced by twisting an optical resonator. Photons
entering this system undergo collisions to form pairs in an angular momentum
superposition consistent with the Laughlin state. Characterizing the same pairs

Laughlin state. This work heralds a new era of quantum many-body optics, where
strongly interacting and topological photons enable exploration of quantum

have been many approaches to explore Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics
within the framework of open quantum systems, but the richness of the ensuing
dynamics is still not fully understood. In this paper we develop a
non-Markovian extension of the standard Caldeira-Leggett model, based on
expanding the dynamics of the reduced system at high temperature in inverse
powers of the high-frequency cut-off of the Ohmic spectral density of the
environment, and derive a non-Markovian master equation for the reduced density
matrix for the case of a general potential. We also obtain a fully analytical
solution in the free particle case. While the short-time behaviour of this
solution does not diverge substantially from the Markovian behaviour, at
intermediate times we find a resurgence of coherence, which we name lateral
coherence. We identify this with a corresponding transient negative entropy
production rate, which is understood to be characteristic of non-Markovian
dynamics. We also analyze the positivity of the reduced density matrix, and
derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation in the classical limit.

integrating advanced electronic structure method and an efficient

Moreover, the time evolution of the Mott volume fraction is found to follow a

period, the early stage of the phase transformation is characterized by a
constant nucleation rate and an interface-controlled cluster growth mechanism,
consistent with the classical theory developed by Kolmogorov, Johnson, Mehl,

transformation that is significantly different from the prediction of the

TDEs, and accurate theoretical modeling is required to interpret the data with
precision. Here we analyze the influence of more realistic stellar structure on
the outcome of TDEs; in particular, we compare the fallback rates -- being the
rate at which tidally-disrupted debris returns to the black hole -- from
progenitors generated with the stellar evolution code {\sc mesa} to $\gamma =
4/3$ and $\gamma = 5/3$ polytropes. We find that {\sc mesa}-generated density
profiles yield qualitatively-different fallback rates as compared to polytropic
approximations, and that only the fallback curves from low-mass ($1M_{\odot}$
or less), zero-age main-sequence stars are well fit by either a $\gamma = 4/3$
or $5/3$ polytrope. Stellar age has a strong affect on the shape of the
fallback curve, and can produce characteristic timescales (e.g., the time to
the peak of the fallback rate) that greatly differ from the polytropic values.
We use these differences to assess the degree to which the inferred black hole
mass from the observed lightcurve can deviate from the true value, and find
that the discrepancy can be at the order of magnitude level. Accurate stellar
structure also leads to a substantial variation in the critical impact
parameter at which the star is fully disrupted, and can increase the
susceptibility of the debris stream to fragmentation under its own
self-gravity. These results suggest that detailed modeling is required to
accurately interpret observed lightcurves of TDEs.

structured jets naturally produce shallow phases in the X-ray afterglow of

last between $10^2-10^5$ s. They naturally reproduce the observed distributions

plateau duration, plateau luminosity and prompt $\gamma$-ray energy. An
advantage of this interpretation is that it involves no late time energy

oriented in different directions with respect to the orbital angular momentum
vector. We focus specifically on the characterisation of the evolution of the
degree of differential rotation and anisotropy in the velocity space, and we
quantify the process of spatial and kinematic mixing of the two populations. In
light of recent and forthcoming explorations of the internal kinematics of this
class of stellar systems by means of line-of sight and astrometric
measurements, we also investigate the implications of projection effects and
spatial distribution of the stars adopted as tracers. The kinematic and
structural richness emerging from our models further emphasises the need and
the importance of observational studies aimed at building a complete
kinematical picture of the multiple population phenomenon.

interactions, and therefore translate individual movement behavior into
higher-level ecological processes. Indeed, a large body of interacting
population theory rests on the law of mass action, which can be derived from
assumptions of Brownian motion in an enclosed container with exclusively local
perception. These assumptions imply completely uniform space use, individual
home ranges equivalent to the population range, and encounter dependent on
movement paths actually crossing. Mounting empirical evidence, however,
suggests that animals use space non-uniformly, occupy home ranges substantially
smaller than the population range, and are often capable of nonlocal
perception. Here, we explore how these empirically supported behaviors change
pairwise encounter rates. Specifically, we derive novel analytical expressions
for encounter rates under Ornstein-Uhlenbeck motion, which features non-uniform
space use and allows individual home ranges to differ from the population
range. We compare OU-based encounter predictions to those of Reflected Brownian
Motion, from which the law of mass action can be derived. For both models, we
further explore how the interplay between the scale of perception and home
range size affects encounter rates. We find that neglecting realistic movement
and perceptual behaviors can systematically bias encounter rate predictions.

absorption profiles (e.g. C IV, Si IV) present significant absorption excess in
their blue wings (v $<$ -100 km/s) relative to the red wings (v $>$ 100 km/s).
The stronger blue wings in high-ionization species are indicative of the
presence of ubiquitous warm outflows in the GRB hosts at high redshifts. We
used simple toy models to kinematically distinguish the CGM and ISM absorption

the evolution of the CGM metal mass by $\sim$ 0.5 dex between two redshift

$M_{*} > 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, the ratio of C IV mass in the CGM to the stellar
mass remains fairly uniform, with $log(M_{CIV}/M_{*}) \sim -4.5$ within

extended atmosphere that dwarfs its own host star. Predictions of atmospheric
escape in such planets state that H atoms escape from the upper atmosphere in a
collisional regime and that the flow can drag heavier atoms to the upper
atmosphere. It is unclear, however, what astrophysical mechanisms drive the
process. Our objective is to leverage the extensive coverage of HST/COS
observations of the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum of GJ 436 to search for
signals of metallic ions in the upper atmosphere of GJ 436 b. We analyzed flux
time-series of species present in the FUV spectrum of GJ 436, as well as the
Lyman-$\alpha$ line. GJ 436 displays FUV flaring events with a rate of $\sim$10
d$^{-1}$. There is evidence for a possibly long-lived active region or
longitude that modulates the FUV metallic lines of the star with amplitudes up
to 20%. Despite the strong geocoronal contamination in the COS spectra, we
detected in-transit excess absorption signals of $\sim$50% and $\sim$30% in the
blue and red wings, respectively, of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line. We rule out a
wide range of excess absorption levels in the metallic lines of the star during
the transit. The large atmospheric loss of GJ 436 b observed in Lyman-$\alpha$
transmission spectra is stable over the timescale of a few years, and the red
wing signal supports the presence of a variable hydrogen absorption source
besides the stable exosphere. The previously claimed in-transit absorption in
the Si III line is likely an artifact resulting from the stellar magnetic
cycle. The non-detection of metallic ions in absorption could indicate that the
escape is not hydrodynamic or that the atmospheric mixing is not efficient in
dragging metals high enough for sublimation to produce a detectable escape rate
of ions to the exosphere.

circulation on the vortex generator is computed from integrating the pressure
force along the VG height calculated using CFD. It is then assumed that all
this bound circulation is shed into the wake to fulfill Helmholtz's theorem and
then curl up into one primary tip vortex. To validate this, the trailed
circulation estimated from the distribution of the bound circulation is
compared to the one in the wake behind the vortex generator determined directly
from the wake velocities at some downstream distance. In practical situations,
the pressure distribution on the vane is unknown and consequently other
estimates of the spanwise force distribution on the VG must instead be applied,
such as using 2D airfoil data corresponding to the VG geometry at each
wall-normal distance. Such models have previously been proposed and used as an
engineering tool to aid preliminary VG design and it is not the purpose of this
paper to refine such engineering models, but to validate their assumptions such
as applying a lifting line model on a VG that has a very low aspect ratio and
placed in wall boundary layer. Herein, high Reynolds number boundary layer
measurements of VG induced flow were used to validate the Reynolds Averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeled circulation results and are used for further
illustration and validation of the hypothesis.

the coverage of the monitored area and the number of the acquired samples,

VQ-BNN inference for data streams is given by temporal exponential smoothing of

the target gesture while preserving the background context, thus effectively
dealing with gesture translation in the wild. To this aim, we use an attention
module and a rolling guidance approach, which loops the generated images back

works. Thus, our GAN learns to generate new images from simple annotations
without requiring key-points or skeleton labels. Results on two public datasets

is concentrated near a nonlinear subspace or manifold. Most approaches require
choice of a kernel, with the multivariate Gaussian by far the most commonly

kernels cannot capture curvature in the support of the data. This leads to poor
performance unless the sample size is very large relative to the dimension of
the data. This article proposes a novel generalization of the Gaussian
distribution, which includes an additional curvature parameter. We refer to the
proposed class as Fisher-Gaussian (FG) kernels, since they arise by sampling
from a von Mises-Fisher density on the sphere and adding Gaussian noise. The FG
density has an analytic form, and is amenable to straightforward implementation
within Bayesian mixture models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We provide
theory on large support, and illustrate gains relative to competitors in

precise and accurate, and is parallel to, but independent of the Cepheid

Hubble tension. It agrees at the 1.2-sigma level with that of the Planck 2018

the Cepheid distance scale. The TRGB distances have been measured using deep
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging of
galaxy halos. The zero point of the TRGB calibration is set with a distance

galaxies that extend our measurement into the Hubble flow using the recently
completed Carnegie Supernova Project I sample containing about 100
well-observed SNeIa. There are several advantages of halo TRGB distance
measurements relative to Cepheid variables: these include low halo reddening,
minimal effects of crowding or blending of the photometry, only a shallow
(calibrated) sensitivity to metallicity in the I-band, and no need for multiple
epochs of observations or concerns of different slopes with period. In
addition, the host masses of our TRGB host-galaxy sample are higher on average
than the Cepheid sample, better matching the range of host-galaxy masses in the
CSP distant sample, and reducing potential systematic effects in the SNeIa
measurements.

For the latter, we observe that existing results provide constant and tight

We then switch our attention to improving the price of anarchy by means of a
simple coordination mechanism that has no knowledge of the instance. We show
that our mechanism reduces the price of anarchy of games with $n$ jobs and unit

intractable. Thus, the creation of new methods which can handle many expression
measurements on relatively small numbers of patients while also uncovering
gene-gene relationships and predicting well is desirable.
  Results: We develop a new technique for using the marginal relationship
between gene expression measurements and patient survival outcomes to identify
a small subset of genes which appear highly relevant for predicting survival,
produce a low-dimensional embedding based on this small subset, and amplify
this embedding with information from the remaining genes. We motivate our
methodology by using gene expression measurements to predict survival time for
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, illustrate the behavior of our
methodology on carefully constructed synthetic examples, and test it on a
number of other gene expression datasets. Our technique is computationally
tractable, generally outperforms other methods, is extensible to other
phenotypes, and also identifies different genes (relative to existing methods)
for possible future study.

model which enables us to capture possible Beyond the SM (BSM) scenarios. We
discuss in particular three such scenarios: one where the SM state is
supplemented by an additional scalar, one which builds upon a 2-Higgs Doublet
Model (2HDM) framework and another which realises a Composite Higgs Model (CHM)
through partial compositeness. Such exotic decays of the $t'$ can be
competitive with decays into SM particles, leading to new possible discovery
channels at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Assuming $t'$ pair production via
strong interactions, we design signal regions optimised for one $t'\rightarrow
S t$ transition (while being inclusive on the other \bar{t'} decay, and vice
versa), followed by the decay of $S$ into the two very clean experimental
signatures $S\rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ and $S\rightarrow Z(\rightarrow
\ell^+\ell^-)\gamma$. We perform a dedicated signal-to-background analysis in
both channels, by using Monte Carlo (MC) event simulations modelling the
dynamics from the proton-proton to the detector level. Under the assumption of
BR$(t' \rightarrow S t) = 100\%$, we are therefore able to realistically
quantify the sensitivity of the LHC to both the $t'$ and $S$ masses, assuming
both current and foreseen luminosities. This approach paves the way for the LHC

infinite sequence of instructions, that dictate the movements performed by the

the set of instructions can be a function of the initial locations of the agent

the agent performs a random movement instead of following the current

  This paper provides two results on this problem. First, we show that for some

agent home in finite expected time. Second, we complement this impossibility
result with an algorithm that, for sufficiently small values of $p$, yields a
finite expected hitting time for home. In particular, we show that for any $p <

a standard approach to analysing clustered and longitudinal data in the social,
behavioural and medical sciences. This review article focuses on multilevel
linear regression models for continuous responses (outcomes or dependent
variables). These models can be viewed as an extension of conventional linear
regression models to account for and learn from the clustering in the data.
Common clustered applications include studies of school effects on student
achievement, hospital effects on patient health, and neighbourhood effects on
respondent attitudes. In all these examples, multilevel models allow one to
study how the regression relationships vary across clusters, to identify those
cluster characteristics which predict such variation, to disentangle social
processes operating at different levels of analysis, and to make
cluster-specific predictions. Common longitudinal applications include studies
of growth curves of individual height and weight and developmental trajectories
of individual behaviours. In these examples, multilevel models allow one to
describe and explain variation in growth rates and to simultaneously explore
predictors of both of intra- and inter-individual variation. This article
introduces and illustrates this powerful class of model. We start by focusing
on the most commonly applied two-level random-intercept and -slope models. We
illustrate through two detailed examples how these models can be applied to
both clustered and longitudinal data and in both observational and experimental
settings. We then review more flexible three-level, cross-classified, multiple
membership and multivariate response models. We end by recommending a range of
further reading on all these topics.

the GHZ states in the X, Y, and Z bases form a maximally sensitive set of

The model simulates the balance sheets of insurance firms, who collect premiums
from clients in return for ensuring them against intermittent, heavy-tailed
risks. Firms manage their capital and pay dividends to their investors, and use
either reinsurance contracts or cat bonds to hedge their tail risk. The model
generates plausible time series of profits and losses and recovers stylized
facts, such as the insurance cycle and the emergence of asymmetric, long tailed
firm size distributions. We use the model to investigate the problem of risk
model homogeneity. Under Solvency II, insurance companies are required to use
only certified risk models. This has led to a situation in which only a few
firms provide risk models, creating a systemic fragility to the errors in these
models. We demonstrate that using too few models increases the risk of
nonpayment and default while lowering profits for the industry as a whole. The
presence of the reinsurance industry ameliorates the problem but does not
remove it. Our results suggest that it would be valuable for regulators to
incentivize model diversity. The framework we develop here provides a first
step toward a simulation model of the insurance industry for testing policies

Rubidium atom by two low-intensity continuous-wave lasers [Pursehouse et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 053204 (2019)]. In a one-photon process the first laser
excites the 5p level while the second uncorrelated photon elevates the excited
population to the continuum. This same continuum state can also be reached when
the second laser excites the 6p state and the first photon then triggers the
ionization. As the two lasers are weak and their relative phases uncorrelated,
the coherence needed for generating the interference stems from the atom
itself. Increasing the intensity or shortening the laser pulses enhances the
probability that two photons from both lasers act at the same time, and hence
the coherence properties of the applied lasers are expected to affect the
interference fringes. Here, this aspect is investigated in detail, and it is
shown how tuning the temporal shapes of the laser pulses allows for tracing the
time-dependence of the interference fringes. We also study the influence of
applying a third laser field with a random amplitude, resulting in a random

continues to hit new milestones, concerted effort has shifted towards
understanding, and potentially controlling, the mechanisms of magnetic

in molecules is highly temperature-, field-, and environment-dependent with the
relevant timescale easily traversing ten orders of magnitude for current

nature of (and transition probabilities between) magnetic states make
unraveling the underlying mechanisms an important yet daunting challenge.
Currently, instrumental considerations dictate that the characteristic
relaxation time, $\tau$, is determined by separate methods depending on the
timescale of interest. Static and dynamic probe fields are used for long and
short timescales, respectively. Each method captures a distinct,
non-overlapping time range, and experimental differences lead to the
possibility of fundamentally different meanings for $\tau$ being plotted and
fitted globally as a function of temperature. Herein, we present a method to
generate long-timescale waveforms with standard vibrating sample magnetometry

in which an unknown source string $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ is transmitted through a
probabilistic channel which may randomly delete coordinates or insert random
bits, resulting in a \emph{trace} of $x$. The goal is to reconstruct the
original string~$x$ from independent traces of $x$. While the best algorithms
known for worst-case strings use $\exp(O(n^{1/3}))$ traces
\cite{DOS17,NazarovPeres17}, highly efficient algorithms are known
\cite{PZ17,HPP18} for the \emph{average-case} version, in which $x$ is
uniformly random. We consider a generalization of this average-case trace
reconstruction problem, which we call \emph{average-case population recovery in
the presence of insertions and deletions}. In this problem, there is an unknown
distribution $\cal{D}$ over $s$ unknown source strings $x^1,\dots,x^s \in
\{0,1\}^n$, and each sample is independently generated by drawing some $x^i$
from $\cal{D}$ and returning an independent trace of $x^i$.
  Building on \cite{PZ17} and \cite{HPP18}, we give an efficient algorithm for
this problem. For any support size $s \leq \smash{\exp(\Theta(n^{1/3}))}$, for
a $1-o(1)$ fraction of all $s$-element support sets $\{x^1,\dots,x^s\} \subset
\{0,1\}^n$, for every distribution $\cal{D}$ supported on $\{x^1,\dots,x^s\}$,
our algorithm efficiently recovers ${\cal D}$ up to total variation distance
$\epsilon$ with high probability, given access to independent traces of
independent draws from $\cal{D}$. The algorithm runs in time
poly$(n,s,1/\epsilon)$ and its sample complexity is
poly$(s,1/\epsilon,\exp(\log^{1/3}n)).$ This polynomial dependence on the
support size $s$ is in sharp contrast with the \emph{worst-case} version (when
$x^1,\dots,x^s$ may be any strings in $\{0,1\}^n$), in which the sample
complexity of the most efficient known algorithm \cite{BCFSS19} is doubly

constitutes a major challenge. Indoor wireless optical backhauling is a novel
approach whereby the interconnections between adjacent LiFi BSs are provided by
way of directed line-of-sight (LOS) wireless infrared (IR) links. Building on
the aforesaid approach, this paper presents the top-down design of a multi-hop
wireless backhaul configuration for multi-tier optical attocell networks by
proposing the novel idea of super cells. Such cells incorporate multiple
clusters of attocells that are connected to the core network via a single
gateway based on multi-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. Consequently, new
challenges arise for managing the bandwidth and power resources of the
bottleneck backhaul. By putting forward user-based bandwidth scheduling (UBS)
and cell-based bandwidth scheduling (CBS) policies, the system-level modeling
and analysis of the end-to-end multi-user sum rate is elaborated. In addition,
optimal bandwidth scheduling under both UBS and CBS policies are formulated as
constrained convex optimization problems, which are solved by using the
projected subgradient method. Furthermore, the transmission power of the
backhaul system is opportunistically reduced by way of an innovative fixed
power control (FPC) strategy. The notion of backhaul bottleneck occurrence
(BBO) is introduced. An accurate approximate expression of the probability of
BBO is derived, and then verified using Monte Carlo simulations. Several
insights are provided into the offered gains of the proposed schemes through
extensive computer simulations, by studying different aspects of the
performance of super cells including the average sum rate, the BBO probability
and the backhaul power efficiency (PE).

stochastic processes characterized by a crossover from anomalous to normal
behavior. This is particularly welcome, as a growing number of experiments
suggest the crossover to be a common feature shared by many systems: in some
cases the anomalous part of the dynamics amounts to a Brownian yet non-Gaussian
diffusion; more generally, both the diffusion exponent and the distribution may
deviate from normal behavior in the initial part of the process. Since proposed
theories work at a mesoscopic scale invoking the subordination of
diffusivities, it is of primary importance to bridge these representations with
a more fundamental, ``microscopic'' description. We argue that the dynamical
behavior of macromolecules during simple polymerization processes provide
suitable setups in which analytic, numerical, and particle-tracking experiments
can be contrasted at such a scope. Specifically, we demonstrate that Brownian
yet non-Gaussian diffusion of the center of mass of a polymer is a direct
consequence of the polymerization process. Through the kurtosis, we
characterize the early-stage non-Gaussian behavior within a phase diagram, and
we also put forward an estimation for the crossover time to ordinary Brownian
motion.

McKean-Vlasov dynamics. Both algorithms are based on approximations of the
theoretical solutions by neural networks, the latter being characterized by
their architecture and a set of parameters. This allows the use of modern
machine learning tools, and efficient implementations of stochastic gradient
descent.The first algorithm is based on the idiosyncrasies of the ergodic
optimal control problem. We provide a mathematical proof of the convergence of
the approximation scheme, and we analyze rigorously the approximation by
controlling the different sources of error. The second method is an adaptation
of the deep Galerkin method to the system of partial differential equations
issued from the optimality condition. We demonstrate the efficiency of these
algorithms on several numerical examples, some of them being chosen to show
that our algorithms succeed where existing ones failed. We also argue that both
methods can easily be applied to problems in dimensions larger than what can be
found in the existing literature. Finally, we illustrate the fact that,
although the first algorithm is specifically designed for mean field control
problems, the second one is more general and can also be applied to the partial
differential equation systems arising in the theory of mean field games.

Different known attacks on block ciphers have resulted in diverse cryptographic
criteria of vectorial Boolean functions,such as differential distribution table
and nonlinearity. Very recently, Bar-On et al. introduced at Eurocrypt'19 a new
tool, called the Differential-Linear Connectivity Table (DLCT).This paper is a
follow-up work, which presents further theoretical characterization of the DLCT
of vectorial Boolean functions and also investigates this new criterion of
functions with certain forms. In this paper we introduce a generalized concept
of the additive autocorrelation, which is extended from Boolean functions to
the vectorial Boolean functions, and use it as a main tool to investigate the
DLCT property of vectorial Boolean functions. Firstly, by establishing a
connection between the DLCT and the additive autocorrelation, we characterize
properties of DLCT by means of the Walsh transform and the differential
distribution table, and present generic lower bounds on the differential-linear
uniformity (DLU) of vectorial Boolean functions. Furthermore, we investigate
the DLCT property of monomials, APN, plateaued and AB functions. Our study
reveals that the DLCT of these special functions are closely related to other
cryptographic criteria. Next, we prove that the DLU of vectorial Boolean
functions is invariant underthe EA equivalence but not invariant under the CCZ
equivalence, and that the DLCT spectrum is only invariant under affine
equivalence. In addition, under affine equivalence, we exhaust the DLCT spectra
and DLU of optimal S-boxes with $4$ bit by Magma. Finally, we investigate the
DLCT spectra and DLU of some polynomials over $F_{2^n}$, including the inverse,
Gold, Bracken-Leander power functions and all quadratic polynomials.

extraordinary isotopic composition indicative of past processing in the CNO

the remnant acquired with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope at an
unprecedented sensitivity and spectral coverage. The spectra cover features of
key elements - including H, He, C, N, and O - at ionization degrees I-III. A
classical analysis of the spectra allows us to identify several
spatio-kinematic components in the probed part of the nebula at electron
temperatures of 10-15 kK and densities of 200-600 cm$^{-3}$. We find that the
nebula is most likely excited by shocks rather than by direct radiation of the
stellar remnant. We provide a detailed analysis of the elemental abundances in
the remnant and find that helium is twice more abundant than in the Sun.
Nitrogen is also overabundant with a N/O ratio ten times larger than the solar
one. These anomalous abundances strongly indicate that the observed gas was
processed in CNO cycles of H burning, consistent with the submillimeter
studies. Additionally, sub-solar abundances of heavier elements, such as Ne, S,

multiple different epitopes that forms binding sites for many IgG polyclonal

cross-linking between MNPs and H1N1 nucleoprotein molecules, thereby forming
MNP self-assemblies. Using MPS and the self-assembly of MNPs, we achieved the
sensitivity of 44 nM (442 pmole) for detecting H1N1 nucleoprotein. In addition,
the morphologies and the hydrodynamic sizes of the MNP self-assemblies are

data-driven online selection. Specifically, we are given $n$ cards with
arbitrary non-negative numbers written on both sides. The cards are randomly
placed on $n$ consecutive positions on a table, and for each card, the visible
side is also selected at random. The player sees the visible side of all cards
and wants to select the card with the maximum hidden value. To this end, the
player flips the first card, sees its hidden value and decides whether to pick
it or drop it and continue with the next card.
  We study algorithms for two natural objectives. In the first one, as in the
secretary problem, the player wants to maximize the probability of selecting
the maximum hidden value. We show that this can be done with probability at
least $0.45292$. In the second one, similar to the prophet inequality, the
player maximizes the expectation of the selected hidden value. We show a
guarantee of at least $0.63518$ with respect to the expected maximum hidden
value.
  Our algorithms result from combining three basic strategies. One is to stop
whenever we see a value larger than the initial $n$ visible numbers. The second
one is to stop the first time the last flipped card's value is the largest of
the currently $n$ visible numbers in the table. And the third one is similar to
the latter but it additionally requires that the last flipped value is larger
than the value on the other side of its card.
  We apply our results to the prophet secretary problem with unknown
distributions, but with access to a single sample from each distribution. Our
guarantee improves upon $1-1/e$ for this problem, which is the currently best
known guarantee and only works for the i.i.d. case.

  possible journal publication (Online Available: arXiv:2002.10112)",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) that enables the control of the wireless
propagation environment has been looked upon as a promising technology for
boosting the spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless communication
systems. Prior works on IRS are mainly based on the ideal phase shift model
assuming the full signal reflection by each of the elements regardless of its
phase shift, which, however, is practically difficult to realize. In contrast,
we propose in this paper a practical phase shift model that captures the
phase-dependent amplitude variation in the element-wise reflection coefficient.
Applying this new model to an IRS-aided wireless system, we formulate a problem
to maximize its achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming
and the IRS reflect beamforming. The formulated problem is non-convex and
difficult to be optimally solved in general, for which we propose a
low-complexity suboptimal solution based on the alternating optimization (AO)
technique. Simulation results unveil a substantial performance gain achieved by
the joint beamforming optimization based on the proposed phase shift model as
compared to the conventional ideal model.

prepare a few seed atoms, which establish a blockade region due to strong
long-range interaction between Rydberg-atom pairs. The second color (pulse B)
is blue detuned relative to Rydberg transition and enables further Rydberg
excitation of atoms by counteracting the blockade effect. It is found that a
few seed atoms lead to a huge difference of the Rydberg excitation with pulse
B. The dynamic evolution of antiblockade excitation by varying the pulse-B
duration at 30-MHz blue detuning is also investigated. The evolution result
reveals that a small amount of seed atoms can trigger an avalanche Rydberg

is further exacerbated by their intricate dynamics. Modern machine learning
methods are particularly well-suited for analyzing and modeling complex

We demonstrate an unsupervised learning technique for extracting interpretable
physical parameters from noisy spatiotemporal data and for building a
transferable model of the system. In particular, we implement a
physics-informed architecture based on variational autoencoders that is
designed for analyzing systems governed by partial differential equations
(PDEs). The architecture is trained end-to-end and extracts latent parameters
that parameterize the dynamics of a learned predictive model for the system. To
test our method, we train our model on simulated data from a variety of PDEs
with varying dynamical parameters that act as uncontrolled variables. Numerical
experiments show that our method can accurately identify relevant parameters
and extract them from raw and even noisy spatiotemporal data (tested with
roughly 10% added noise). These extracted parameters correlate well (linearly
with $R^2 > 0.95$) with the ground truth physical parameters used to generate
the datasets. We then apply this method to nonlinear fiber propagation data,
generated by an ab-initio simulation, to demonstrate its capabilities on a more
realistic dataset. Our method for discovering interpretable latent parameters
in spatiotemporal systems will allow us to better analyze and understand
real-world phenomena and datasets, which often have unknown and uncontrolled
variables that alter the system dynamics and cause varying behaviors that are
difficult to disentangle.

the process soon becomes totally incalculable with a slightly big size, which

MPNet uses neural networks to learn general near-optimal heuristics for path

as raw point-cloud from depth sensors, as well as a robot's initial and desired
goal configurations and recursively calls itself to bidirectionally generate
connectable paths. In addition to finding directly connectable and near-optimal
paths in a single pass, we show that worst-case theoretical guarantees can be

and optimality improvements. To train the MPNet models, we present an active
continual learning approach that enables MPNet to learn from streaming data and
actively ask for expert demonstrations when needed, drastically reducing data

to a sum of exponential interactions $e^{-\lambda r_{ij}}$ with varying
exponents $\lambda$, each of which can be represented by a simple matrix
product operator (MPO) with bond dimension $D=3$. Using this technique,
efficient and accurate simulations of 1D quantum systems with long-range
interactions can be performed using matrix product states (MPS). However, the
extension of this construction to higher dimensions is not obvious. We report
how to generalize the exponential basis to 2D and 3D by defining the basis
functions as the Green's functions of the discretized Helmholtz equation for
different Helmholtz parameters $\lambda$, a construction which is valid for
lattices of any spatial dimension. Compact tensor network representations can
then be found for the discretized Green's functions, by expressing them as
correlation functions of auxiliary fermionic fields with nearest neighbor
interactions via Grassmann Gaussian integration. Interestingly, this analytic
construction in 3D yields a $D=4$ tensor network representation of correlation
functions which (asymptotically) decay as the inverse distance ($r^{-1}_{ij}$),
thus generating the (screened) Coulomb potential on a cubic lattice. These
techniques will be useful in tensor network simulations of realistic materials.

scene layouts, while local structure reflects shape details. Recently developed
approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) significantly improve
the performance of depth estimation. However, few of them take into account
multi-scale structures in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a
Structure-Aware Residual Pyramid Network (SARPN) to exploit multi-scale
structures for accurate depth prediction. We propose a Residual Pyramid Decoder
(RPD) which expresses global scene structure in upper levels to represent
layouts, and local structure in lower levels to present shape details. At each
level, we propose Residual Refinement Modules (RRM) that predict residual maps
to progressively add finer structures on the coarser structure predicted at the
upper level. In order to fully exploit multi-scale image features, an Adaptive
Dense Feature Fusion (ADFF) module, which adaptively fuses effective features
from all scales for inferring structures of each scale, is introduced.
Experiment results on the challenging NYU-Depth v2 dataset demonstrate that our
proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluation. The code is available at

main aim of the mission was to test the technique of measuring the ultraviolet
fluorescence and Cherenkov radiation of extensive air showers generated by
primary cosmic rays with energies above ~100 EeV in the Earth atmosphere from
space. During its operation for 1.5 years, TUS registered almost 80,000 events
with a few of them satisfying conditions anticipated for extensive air showers
(EASs) initiated by UHECRs. Here we discuss an event registered on 3rd October
2016. The event was measured in perfect observation conditions as an
ultraviolet track in the nocturnal atmosphere of the Earth, with the kinematics
and the light curve similar to those expected from an EAS. A reconstruction of
parameters of a primary particle gave the zenith angle around 44$^\circ$ but an
extreme energy not compatible with the cosmic ray energy spectrum obtained with
ground-based experiments. We discuss in details all conditions of registering
the event, explain the reconstruction procedure and its limitations and comment

orbital telescope to detect light signals with the apparent motion and light

information of MSS, the minimality inspection of segments is further simplified
to the prior detection of partitions. The MSS problem is then modeled as a
computable optimization problem via self-expressiveness of samples. A closed
form of representation matrices is first given for the self-expressiveness, and
the connection of diagonal blocks is then addressed. The MSS model uses a rank
restriction on the sum of segment ranks. Theoretically, it can retrieve the
minimal sample subspaces that could be heavily intersected. The optimization
problem is solved via a basic manifold conjugate gradient algorithm,
alternative optimization and hybrid optimization, taking into account of
solving both the primal MSS problem and its pseudo-dual problem. The MSS model

simplifying assumptions, such as mixing length theory, in order to describe

correctly recover the surface layers of the Sun and other stars with convective
envelopes. We present a method that overcomes this structural drawback by
employing three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of stellar envelopes:
at every time-step of the evolution interpolated 3D envelopes are appended to
the 1D structure and are used to supply realistic boundary conditions for the
stellar interior. In contrast to previous attempts, our method includes mean 3D
turbulent pressure. We apply our method to model the present Sun. The
structural shortcomings of standard stellar models lead to systematic errors in
the stellar oscillation frequencies inferred from the model. We show that our
method fully corrects for this error. Furthermore, we show that our realistic
treatment of superadiabatic convection alters the predicted evolution of the
Sun. Our results hence have important implications for the characterization of
stars. This has ramifications for neighbouring fields, such as exoplanet

They adapt to devices' channel states and computation capacities so as to

decreased. By iterating the expansion, we systematically reduce string

is the first closed-form result for such multitrace amplitudes and thus greatly
extends our result for the single-trace case. As a byproduct, it gives a new

learning for QA, where a source language task with plentiful annotations is
utilized to improve the performance of a QA model on a target language task

machine translation (MT) based approach translates the source language into the
target language, or vice versa. Although the MT-based approach brings
improvement, it assumes the availability of a sentence-level translation

language-universal feature representations, and consequentially transfer
knowledge from the source language. The GAN-based approach rivals the
performance of the MT-based approach with fewer linguistic resources. Applying
both approaches simultaneously yield the best results. We use two English

factor, Q. Narrow line widths in the microHertz regime and mechanical Q's as
high as $10^{12}$ have been predicted for levitated systems, but to date, the
poor stability of these oscillators over long periods have prevented direct

to be able to then grasp novel objects seen only from a single view-point.
Recently, progress has been made in data-efficient learning of generative grasp
models which transfer well to novel objects. These generative grasp models are
learned from demonstration (LfD). One weakness is that, as this paper shall
show, grasp transfer under challenging single view conditions is unreliable.
Second, the number of generative model elements rises linearly in the number of
training examples. This, in turn, limits the potential of these generative
models for generalisation and continual improvement. In this paper, it is shown
how to address these problems. Several technical contributions are made: (i) a
view-based model of a grasp; (ii) a method for combining and compressing
multiple grasp models; (iii) a new way of evaluating contacts that is used both
to generate and to score grasps. These, together, improve both grasp
performance and reduce the number of models learned for grasp transfer. These
advances, in turn, also allow the introduction of autonomous training, in which
the robot learns from self-generated grasps. Evaluation on a challenging test
set shows that, with innovations (i)-(iii) deployed, grasp transfer success
rises from 55.1% to 81.6%. By adding autonomous training this rises to 87.8%.
These differences are statistically significant. In total, across all

guarantees in this field. A quantitative description of RIP involves bounding
the so-called RIP constants of measurement matrices. In this respect, it is
noteworthy that most results in the literature concerning RIP are upper bounds
of RIP constants, which can be interpreted as a theoretical guarantee of
successful sparse recovery. On the contrary, the land of lower bounds for RIP
constants remains uncultivated. Lower bounds of RIP constants, if exist, can be
interpreted as the fundamental limit aspect of successful sparse recovery. In
this paper, the lower bound of RIP constants Gaussian random matrices are
derived, along with a guide for generalization to sub-Gaussian random matrices.
This provides a new proof of the fundamental limit that the minimal number of
measurements needed to enforce the RIP of order $s$ is $\Omega(s\log({\rm

argument. Furthermore, in the proof, we propose a useful technical tool

no HI Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Our search has, for the first time, resulted in a
sample of 30 homogeneously selected ghostly DLAs with $z_{\rm QSO}$$>$2.0.
Thirteen of the ghostly DLAs exhibit absorption from other HI Lyman series

them being dense and compact with projected sizes smaller than the broad line
region (BLR) of the background quasar. Although uncertain, the estimated median
HI column density of these absorbers is log$N$(HI)$\sim$21.0. We compare the
properties of ghostly DLAs with those of eclipsing DLAs that are high column
density absorbers, located within 1500 km/s of the quasar emission redshift and
showing strong Ly$\alpha$ emission in their DLA trough. We discover an apparent
sequence in the observed properties of these DLAs with ghostly DLAs showing
wider HI kinematics, stronger absorptions from high-ionization species, CII and
SiII excited states, and higher level of dust extinction. Since we estimate
that all these DLAs have similar metallicities, log$Z/Z_{\odot}$$\sim$$-$1.0,
we conclude that ghostly DLAs are part of the same population as eclipsing
DLAs, except that they are denser and located closer to the central active

incorporates macropores, while the latter contains micropores. Although there
exist models based on the series-parallel tubes approach, here we apply
concepts from critical path analysis, a theoretical technique from statistical
physics, to estimate water relative permeability (krw) in dual-porosity media.
For this purpose, we use two datasets from the literature collected under two
different cultivation conditions: (i) conventional tillage (CT) and (ii)
non-tillage (NT). Each dataset consists of 13 soil samples for which capillary
pressure curve and water relative permeability were measured at 500 data point

permeability from the measured capillary pressure curve using two methods: (1)
critical path analysis (CPA), and (2) series-parallel tubes (vG-M), both models
adapted for dual-porosity media. Comparing the theoretical estimations with the
experimental measurements shows that CPA resulted in more accurate krw
estimations than vG-M. We demonstrate that precise estimation of krw via CPA
requires accurate characterization of capillary pressure curve and precise

of low signal statistics. We characterize the diffuse TeV flux from the Galaxy
using decade-long exposures of the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Considering that
the level of diffuse Galactic emission in the TeV band approaches the level of
residual cosmic-ray background, we estimated the level of residual cosmic-ray
background in the SOURCEVETO event selection and verified that the TeV diffuse
Galactic emission flux is well above the residual cosmic-ray background up to
high Galactic latitude regions. We study spectral and imaging properties of the
diffuse TeV signal from the Galactic plane. We find much stronger emission from
the inner Galactic plane than in previous HESS telescope estimates (lower
bound). We also find a significant difference in the measurement of the
Galactic longitude and latitude profiles of the signal measured by Fermi and
HESS. These discrepancies are presumably explained by the fact that regions of
background estimate in HESS have non-negligible gamma-ray flux. Comparing Fermi
measurements with those of ARGO-YBJ, we find better agreement, with the notable
exception of the Cygnus region, where we find much higher flux (by a factor
1.5). We also measure the TeV diffuse emission spectrum up to high Galactic
latitude and show that the spectra of different regions of the sky have

known to be a clinically heterogeneous group with very subtle patterns of brain
atrophy. To examine the boarders between normal controls (NC) and eMCI,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was extensively used as a non-invasive imaging
modality to pin-down subtle changes in brain images of MCI patients. However,
eMCI research remains limited by the number of available MRI acquisition
timepoints. Ideally, one would learn how to diagnose MCI patients in an early
stage from MRI data acquired at a single timepoint, while leveraging
'non-existing' follow-up observations. To this aim, we propose novel supervised
and unsupervised frameworks that learn how to jointly predict and label the
evolution trajectory of intensity patches, each seeded at a specific brain
landmark, from a baseline intensity patch. Specifically, both strategies aim to
identify the best training atlas patches at baseline timepoint to predict and
classify the evolution trajectory of a given testing baseline patch. The
supervised technique learns how to select the best atlas patches by training
bidirectional mappings from the space of pairwise patch similarities to their
corresponding prediction errors -when one patch was used to predict the other.
On the other hand, the unsupervised technique learns a manifold of baseline
atlas and testing patches using multiple kernels to well capture patch
distributions at multiple scales. Once the best baseline atlas patches are
selected, we retrieve their evolution trajectories and average them to predict
the evolution trajectory of the testing baseline patch. Next, we input the
predicted trajectories to an ensemble of linear classifiers, each trained at a
specific landmark. Our classification accuracy increased by up to 10% points in
comparison to single timepoint-based classification methods.

solving this problem in its original setting: with probability 1, in a complete
communication graph. The only previously known protocol by Cai, Izumi, and Wada

  Observing that any silent protocol solving self-stabilizing leader election
requires $\Omega(n)$ expected parallel time, we introduce a silent protocol
that uses optimal $O(n)$ parallel time and states. Without any silence
constraints, we show that it is possible to solve self-stabilizing leader
election in asymptotically optimal expected parallel time of $O(\log n)$, but
using at least exponential states (a quasi-polynomial number of bits). All of

The memory model is formulated in terms of the equation-defined PS and SFT
devices integrated into the PS/SFT memory cell (MC) circuit. Logical units ""0""
and ""1"" are associated with the two PS states respectively characterized by two
different values of resistance. Elementary logical operations comprising the
read/write processes occur when a word pulse applied to the SFT's injector
coincides with the respective bit pulse acting on MC. Physically, a word pulse
triggers SFT to a resistive state, causing the PS switching between the logical
""0"" and ""1"" states. Thus, the whole switching dynamics of MC depends on the
non-equilibrium and nonstationary properties of PS and SFT. Modeling the single
MC as well as the larger MC-based circuits comprising respectively twelve and
thirty elements suggest that such the memory cells can undergo ultrafast

non-porous, (2) porous with a single internal scale and (3) porous fractals

geometrical parameters such as fractal dimension ($D_f$), lacunarity

relationship between these topological parameters characterising the 3DMPOs and
the resultant wake characteristics. The fractal dimension ($D_f$) and

This paper introduces evolvability ES, an evolutionary algorithm designed to
explicitly and efficiently optimize for evolvability, i.e. the ability to
further adapt. The insight is that it is possible to derive a novel objective
in the spirit of natural evolution strategies that maximizes the diversity of
behaviors exhibited when an individual is subject to random mutations, and that
efficiently scales with computation. Experiments in 2-D and 3-D locomotion
tasks highlight the potential of evolvability ES to generate solutions with
tens of thousands of parameters that can quickly be adapted to solve different

connection between evolvability and a recent and popular gradient-based
meta-learning algorithm called MAML; results show that evolvability ES can
perform competitively with MAML and that it discovers solutions with distinct

state-of-the-art accuracy is quite low and needs improvement to make commercial
applications of SER viable. A key underlying reason for the low accuracy is the
scarcity of emotion datasets, which is a challenge for developing any robust
machine learning model in general. In this paper, we propose a solution to this
problem: a multi-task learning framework that uses auxiliary tasks for which
data is abundantly available. We show that utilisation of this additional data
can improve the primary task of SER for which only limited labelled data is
available. In particular, we use gender identifications and speaker recognition
as auxiliary tasks, which allow the use of very large datasets, e.g., speaker
classification datasets. To maximise the benefit of multi-task learning, we
further use an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) within our framework, which has a
strong capability to learn powerful and discriminative features. Furthermore,
the unsupervised AAE in combination with the supervised classification networks
enables semi-supervised learning which incorporates a discriminative component
in the AAE unsupervised training pipeline. This semi-supervised learning
essentially helps to improve generalisation of our framework and thus leads to
improvements in SER performance. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated for
categorical and dimensional emotion, and cross-corpus scenarios. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two publicly available datasets.

interference from both self- and cross-channel nonlinear interactions of the
continuous-time optical signal is represented by a single discrete-time
perturbative term. Two equivalent discrete-time models can be formulated---one
in the time-domain, the other in the 1/T-periodic continuous-frequency domain.
The time-domain formulation coincides with the well-known pulse-collision
picture. The novel frequency-domain picture incorporates the sampling operation
via an aliased and periodic kernel description. This gives rise to an
alternative perspective on the end-to-end input/output relation between the
spectrum of the discrete-time transmit symbol sequence and the spectrum of the
receive symbol sequence. Both views can be extended from a regular, i.e.,
solely additive model, to a combined regular-logarithmic model to take the
multiplicative nature of certain distortions into consideration. An alternative
formulation of the Gaussian Noise model is provided to take the aliasing of
frequency components correctly into account. A novel algorithmic implementation

of these excitations is the emergence of coherent oscillations of the

$P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$. They are very close to a pair of
heavy baryon-meson thresholds, with the $P_c(4312)$ located $8.9\,{\rm MeV}$
below the $\bar{D} \Sigma_c$ threshold, and the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$
located $21.8$ and $4.8\,{\rm MeV}$ below the $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ one. The
spin-parities of these three states have not been measured yet. In this work we
assume that the $P_c(4312)$ is a $J^P = \tfrac{1}{2}^{-}$ $\bar{D} \Sigma_c$
bound state, while the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ are $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$
bound states of unknown spin-parity, where we notice that the consistent
description of the three pentaquarks in the one-boson-exchange model can indeed
determine the spin and parities of the later, i.e. of the two $\bar{D}^*
\Sigma_c$ molecular candidates. For this determination we revisit first the
one-boson-exchange model, which in its original formulation contains a
short-range delta-like contribution in the spin-spin component of the
potential. We argue that it is better to remove these delta-like contributions
because, in this way, the one-boson-exchange potential will comply with the
naive expectation that the form factors should not have a significant impact in
the long-range part of the potential (in particular the one-pion-exchange
part). Once this is done, we find that it is possible to consistently describe
the three pentaquarks, to the point that the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ can be
predicted from the $P_c(4312)$ within a couple of MeV with respect to their
experimental location. In addition the so-constructed one-boson-exchange model
predicts the preferred quantum numbers of the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$
molecular pentaquarks to be $\tfrac{3}{2}^-$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}^-$,
respectively.

highly scalable and capable monitoring tools are designed and implemented by
Cloud service providers such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Cloud
monitoring tools monitor millions of virtual and physical resources and
continuously generate logs for each one of them. Considering that logs magnify
any technical issue, they can be used for disaster detection, prevention, and
recovery. However, logs are useless if they are not assessed and analyzed
promptly. Thus, we argue that the scale of Cloud-generated logs makes it
impossible for DevOps teams to analyze them effectively. This implies that one
needs to automate the process of monitoring and analysis (e.g., using machine
learning and artificial intelligence). If the automation will witness an
anomaly in the logs --- it will alert DevOps staff. The automatic anomaly
detectors require a reliable and scalable platform for gathering, filtering,
and transforming the logs, executing the detector models, and sending out the
alerts to the DevOps staff. In this work, we report on implementing a prototype
of such a platform based on the 7-layered architecture pattern, which leverages
micro-service principles to distribute tasks among highly scalable,
resources-efficient modules. The modules interact with each other via an
instance of the Publish-Subscribe architectural pattern. The platform is
deployed on the IBM Cloud service infrastructure and is used to detect
anomalies in logs emitted by the IBM Cloud services, hence the dogfooding.

surgical process is well-defined, most previous methods tackled them
separately, without making full use of their relatedness. In this paper, we
present a novel method by developing a multi-task recurrent convolutional
network with correlation loss (MTRCNet-CL) to exploit their relatedness to
simultaneously boost the performance of both tasks. Specifically, our proposed
MTRCNet-CL model has an end-to-end architecture with two branches, which share
earlier feature encoders to extract general visual features while holding
respective higher layers targeting for specific tasks. Given that temporal
information is crucial for phase recognition, long-short term memory (LSTM) is
explored to model the sequential dependencies in the phase recognition branch.
More importantly, a novel and effective correlation loss is designed to model
the relatedness between tool presence and phase identification of each video
frame, by minimizing the divergence of predictions from the two branches.
Mutually leveraging both low-level feature sharing and high-level prediction
correlating, our MTRCNet-CL method can encourage the interactions between the
two tasks to a large extent, and hence can bring about benefits to each other.
Extensive experiments on a large surgical video dataset (Cholec80) demonstrate
outstanding performance of our proposed method, consistently exceeding the

higher-order programs. It is not very handy, however, when one interprets the
specification as an execution mechanism, because terms can grow exponentially
with the number of $\beta$-steps. This is why implementations of functional
languages and proof assistants always rely on some form of sharing of subterms.
These frameworks however do not only evaluate $\lambda$-terms, they also have
to compare them for equality. In presence of sharing, one is actually
interested in the equality---or more precisely $\alpha$-conversion---of the
underlying unshared $\lambda$-terms. The literature contains algorithms for
such a sharing equality, that are polynomial in the sizes of the shared terms.
This paper improves the bounds in the literature by presenting the first linear

sharing as DAGs, and sharing equality as bisimulation of DAGs.

  fermions in $3$D layered systems",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A topological concern is addressed in view of the extensively and intensively
studied topological phases of condensed matter. In this realm, the phases with
topological order cannot be characterized by symmetry alone. Moreover, the
relevant phase transitions do occur without spontaneous symmetry breaking,
beyond the scope of Landau's theory. The first realization of such phases is
the discovery of the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE), which was followed soon
by a topological interpretation. Later on, a distinct, half-integer QHE was
also found from graphene, which has almost spin degeneracy described by $SU(2)$
symmetry. The previous theoretical predictions were realized in this finding.
It has been well understood that the anomaly of this half-integer QHE
originates from the presence of $2$D massless Dirac fermions around the zero
energy with respect to the original Dirac points (DPs). The very characteristic
lies in that there exists a topologically robust zero-mode LL that is a
constant function of the perpendicular magnetic field. More deeply, this
zero-mode LL is protected by the local chiral symmetry (CS), against CS
preserving perturbations provided that intervalley scattering between the
double DPs is inhibited, where the CS arises from the global sublattice
symmetry in spinless graphene. Since massless Dirac particles are broadly
present in condensed matter with various symmetries, not to mention Dirac
bosonic systems, it is of interest to see how about the situations in other
systems with $2$D massless Dirac fermions. We address several notes in a
topological viewpoint on the presence of $2$D massless Dirac fermions in $3$D
layered systems.In particular, we focus on the zero-mode LL since this LL
signifies $2$D massless Dirac fermions.

it is introduced to the discrete velocity space of C-DUGKS, such that more
discrete velocity points can be arranged in the velocity regions that enclose
large number of molecules, and only a few discrete velocity points need to be
arranged in the velocity regions with small amount of molecules in it. By using
the unstructured discrete velocity space, the computational efficiency of
C-DUGKS is significantly increased. A series of numerical tests in a wide range
of Knudsen numbers, such as the Couette flow, lid-driven cavity flow,
two-dimensional rarefied Riemann problem and the supersonic cylinder flows, are
carried out to examine the validity and efficiency of the present method.

precise mathematical meaning to programs. That meaning is a function from the
program's input domain to its output domain determined solely by its syntactic
structure. Such a semantics, fosters the development of portable applications
which are oblivious to the performance characteristics and limitations (such as
a maximum memory footprint) of particular hardware and software platforms. This
paper introduces the idea of intent-driven programming where the meaning of a
program additionally depends on an accompanying intent specification expressing
how the ordinary program meaning is dynamically modified during execution to
satisfy additional properties expressed by the intent. These include both
intensional properties---e.g., resource usage---and extensional
properties---e.g., accuracy of the computed answer. To demonstrate the
intent-driven programming model's value, this paper presents a general-purpose
intent-driven programming language---called FAST---implemented as an extension
of Swift. FAST consists of an intent compiler, a profiler, a general controller
interface and a runtime module which supports interoperation with legacy C/C++
codes. Compared to existing frameworks for adaptive computing, \FAST{} supports
dynamic adaptation to changes both in the operating environment and in the
intent itself, and enables the mixing of procedural control and control based

present time, an enumeration of all polyominoes is nowhere in sight. On the
other hand, there are several subsets of polyominoes for which generating
functions are known. For example, there exists extensive knowledge about
column-convex polyominoes, a model introduced by Temperley in 1956. While
studying column-convex polyominoes, researchers also gave a look at diagonally
convex polyominoes (DCPs), but noticed an awkward feature: when the last
diagonal of a DCP is deleted, the remaining object is not always a polyomino.
So researchers focused their attention on directed DCPs. (A directed DCP is
such a DCP that remains a polyomino when, for any $i$, its last $i$ diagonals
are deleted.) Directed DCPs gradually became well understood, whereas general
DCPs have remained unexplored up to now.
  In this paper, we finally face general DCPs. Modulo a little trick, which
saves us from dealing with non-polyominoes, we use the layered approach
(described in chapter 3 of the book ``Polygons, Polyominoes and Polycubes"",
edited by Anthony Guttmann). The computations are of remarkable bulk. Our main
result is the perimeter generating function for DCPs; we denote it $D(d,x)$.
The function $D(d,x)$ is algebraic and satisfies an equation of degree eight.
The formula for $D(d,x)$ is about eight pages long. That formula involves nine
polynomials in $d$ and $x$, and each of those polynomials is of degree $58$ or
more in $x$. The interested reader can view the formula for $D(d,x)$ in the

operation safety of the modern manufacturing system. In this paper, we proposed
a novel Deep fault diagnosis (DFD) method for rotating machinery with scarce
labeled samples. DFD tackles the challenging problem by transferring knowledge
from shallow models, which is based on the idea that shallow models trained
with different hand-crafted features can reveal the latent prior knowledge and
diagnostic expertise and have good generalization ability even with scarce
labeled samples. DFD can be divided into three phases. First, a spectrogram of
the raw vibration signal is calculated by applying a Short-time Fourier
transform (STFT). From those spectrograms, discriminative time-frequency domain
features can be extracted and used to form a feature pool. Then, several
candidate Support vector machine (SVM) models are trained with different
combinations of features in the feature pool with scarce labeled samples. By
evaluating the pretrained SVM models on the validation set, the most
discriminative features and best-performed SVM models can be selected, which
are used to make predictions on the unlabeled samples. The predicted labels
reserve the expert knowledge originally carried by the SVM model. They are
combined together with the scarce fine labeled samples to form an Augmented
training set (ATS). Finally, a novel 2D deep Convolutional neural network (CNN)
model is trained on the ATS to learn more discriminative features and a better
classifier. Experimental results on two fault diagnosis datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed DFD, which achieves better performance than
SVM models and the vanilla deep CNN model trained on scarce labeled samples.
Moreover, it is computationally efficient and is promising for real-time
rotating machinery fault diagnosis.

for light-harvesting vibronic prototype dimers. The detailed analysis of the
density matrix dynamics reveals that the inclusion of the intramolecular
vibrational modes reinforce up to one order of magnitude the exciton coherence
and may increase the populations of lowest energy single exciton states, as
well as populations and coherences in the site basis. In sharp contrast to the
case of initial-state preparation by coherent (laser)light-sources, the initial
thermal state of the local vibrational modes, as well as that of the
anti-correlated mode, evolves devoid of non-classical correlations as confirmed
by the absence of negative values of its phase-space quasi-probability
distribution at all times. Therefore, not only the long-lived coherences
observed in two-dimensional spectra are induced by the coherent character of
pulsed laser sources, but it is unambiguously shown here that the non-classical
