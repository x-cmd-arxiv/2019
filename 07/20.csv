present the following new results on the Erd\H{o}s-Selfridge function $g(k)$:
We present a new algorithm to compute the value of $g(k)$, and use it to both
verify previous work and compute new values of $g(k)$, with our current limit
being $$ g(323)= 1\ 69829\ 77104\ 46041\ 21145\ 63251\ 22499. $$ We define a
new function $\hat{g}(k)$, and under the assumption of our Uniform Distribution

""probability"". We also provide computational evidence to support our claim that
$\hat{g}(k)$ estimates $g(k)$ reasonably well in practice. There are several
open conjectures on the behavior of $g(k)$ which we are able to prove for
$\hat{g}(k)$, namely that $$ 0.525\ldots +o(1) \quad \le \quad \frac{\log
\hat{g}(k)}{k/\log k} \quad \le \quad 1+o(1), $$ and that $$
\limsup_{k\rightarrow\infty} \frac{\hat{g}(k+1)}{\hat{g}(k)}=\infty.$$ Let
$G(x,k)$ count the number of integers $n\le x$ such that $p(\binom{n}{k})>k$.
Unconditionally, we prove that for large $x$, $G(x,k)$ is asymptotic to
$x/\hat{g}(k)$. And finally, we show that the running time of our new algorithm
is at most $g(k) \exp[ -c (k\log\log k) /(\log k)^2 (1+o(1))]$ for a constant

far been detected only via its gravitational effects. Several theories suggest
that pairs of DM particles can annihilate into a flash of light at gamma-ray
wavelengths. While gamma-ray emission has been observed from environments where
DM is expected to accumulate, such as the centre of our Galaxy, other high
energy sources can create a contaminating astrophysical gamma-ray background,
thus making DM detection difficult. In principle, dwarf galaxies around the
Milky Way are a better place to look -- they contain a greater fraction of DM
with no astrophysical gamma-ray background -- but they are too distant for
gamma-rays to have been seen. A range of observational evidence suggests that
Omega Centauri (omega Cen or NGC 5139), usually classified as the Milky Way's
largest globular cluster, is really the core of a captured and stripped dwarf
galaxy. Importantly, Omega Cen is ten times closer to us than known dwarfs.
Here we show that not only does Omega Cen contain DM with density as high as
compact dwarf galaxies, but also that it emits gamma-rays with an energy
spectrum matching that expected from the annihilation of DM particles with mass
31$\pm$4 GeV (68\% confidence limit). No astrophysical sources have been found
that would otherwise explain Omega Cen's gamma-ray emission, despite deep
multi-wavelength searches. We anticipate our results to be the starting point
for even deeper radio observations of Omega Cen. If multi-wavelength searches
continue to find no astrophysical explanations, this pristine, nearby clump of
DM will become the best place to study DM interactions through forces other
than gravity.

of this paper states that the set $\left\{ A^0,A^1,A^2,\ldots\right\}$ is
finite if and only if the set $\left\{ B^0,B^1,B^2,\ldots\right\}$ is finite.
We apply this result to Cellular Automata (CA). Indeed, it gives a complete and
easy-to-check characterization of sensitivity to initial conditions and
equicontinuity for linear CA over the alphabet $\mathbb{K}^n$ for $\mathbb{K} =
\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ i.e., CA in which the local rule is defined by $n\times
n$-matrices with elements in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. To prove our main
result, we derive an integrality criterion for matrices that is likely of
independent interest. Namely, let $\mathbb{K}$ be any commutative ring (not
necessarily finite), and let $\mathbb{L}$ be a commutative
$\mathbb{K}$-algebra. Consider any $n \times n$-matrix $A$ over $\mathbb{L}$.
Then, $A \in \mathbb{L}^{n \times n}$ is integral over $\mathbb{K}$ (that is,
there exists a monic polynomial $f \in \mathbb{K}\left[t\right]$ satisfying
$f\left(A\right) = 0$) if and only if all coefficients of the characteristic
polynomial of $A$ are integral over $\mathbb{K}$. The proof of this fact relies
on a strategic use of exterior powers (a trick pioneered by Gert Almkvist).
Furthermore, we extend the decidability result concerning sensitivity and
equicontinuity to the wider class of additive CA over a finite abelian group.
For such CA, we also prove the decidability of injectivity, surjectivity,
topological transitivity and all the properties (as, for instance, ergodicity)
that are equivalent to the latter.

affects the charge pumping. As a result, we show that the quantized pumped
charge is robust against the small disorder and find that the pumped charge
increases in the intermediate disorder region. We also examine the doping
effects on the charge pumping and show that the remnant of the quantized pumped
charge at zero doping can be detected. Our results show that the real-time
evolution is a useful technique for detecting the topological properties of the
systems with no bulk gap and/or disorders.

advantage of quantum technologies. In recent work, the notion of coherence with
respect to a general quantum measurement (POVM) was introduced and embedded
into a resource-theoretic framework that generalizes the standard resource
theory of coherence. In particular, POVM-incoherent (free) states and
operations were established. In this work, we explore features of this
framework which arise due to the rich structure of POVMs compared to projective
measurements. Moreover, we introduce a rigorous, probabilisitic framework for
POVM-based coherence measures and free operations. This leads to the
introduction of new, strongly monotonic resource measures that neatly
generalize well-known standard coherence measures. Finally, we show that the
relative entropy of POVM-coherence is equal to the cryptographic randomness
gain, providing an important operational meaning to the concept of coherence
with respect to a general measurement.

Galactic Cosmic Rays up to PeV energies. Some of them have indeed been shown to
accelerate protons to TeV energies and above. But which of them are indeed
efficient accelerators of protons and nuclei? And up to which energies can they
accelerate these particles? Measurements of non-thermal emission, especially in
the X-ray and gamma-ray regimes, are essential to answer these questions. The
High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, surveying the northern TeV
gamma-ray sky, is currently the most sensitive wide field-of-view survey
instrument in the VHE (very-high-energy, $>$100 GeV) range. With more than
three years of data recorded, HAWC is ideally suited for an unbiased survey of
gamma-ray emission from galactic SNRs, particularly at TeV energies and above.
In this proceeding, I will give an overview of recent measurements of VHE
gamma-ray emission from SNRs with the HAWC Observatory. Combined with data from
other wavelengths, these measurements are used to derive information about the
underlying particle populations such as the maximum acceleration energy and
whether leptonic or hadronic processes are responsible for the emission.

with hopping rates governed by different temperatures T > T_c and T_c,
respectively, where T_c indicates the critical temperature for phase ordering,
and with the temperature boundaries oriented perpendicular to the drive. In the
hotter region, the system behaves like the (totally) asymmetric exclusion
processes (TASEP), and experiences particle blockage in front of the interface
to the critical region. To explain this particle density accumulation near the
interface, we have measured the steady-state current in the KLS model at T >
T_c and found it to decay as 1/T. In analogy with TASEP systems containing
""slow"" bonds, we argue that transport in the high-temperature subsystem is
impeded by the lower current in the cooler region, which tends to set the
global stationary particle current value. This blockage is induced by the
extended particle clusters, growing logarithmically with system size, in the
critical region. We observe the density profiles in both high-and
low-temperature subsystems to be similar to the well-characterized coexistence
and maximal-current phases in (T)ASEP models with open boundary conditions,
which are respectively governed by hyperbolic and trigonometric tangent
functions. Yet if the lower temperature is set to T_c, we detect marked
fluctuation corrections to the mean-field density profiles, e.g., the
corresponding critical KLS power law density decay near the interfaces into the

high-coverage test suites. While the majority of research effort has been
devoted to satisfying coverage criteria, a recent trend emerged towards
optimizing other non-coverage aspects. In this regard, runtime and memory usage
are two essential dimensions: less expensive tests reduce the resource demands
for the generation process and later regression testing phases. This study
shows that performance-aware test case generation requires solving two main
challenges: providing a good approximation of resource usage with minimal
overhead and avoiding detrimental effects on both final coverage and fault
detection effectiveness. To tackle these challenges, we conceived a set of
performance proxies -- inspired by previous work on performance testing -- that
provide a reasonable estimation of the test execution costs (i.e., runtime and
memory usage). Thus, we propose an adaptive strategy, called aDynaMOSA, which
leverages these proxies by extending DynaMOSA, a state-of-the-art evolutionary
algorithm in unit testing. Our empirical study -- involving 110 non-trivial
Java classes -- reveals that our adaptive approach generates test suite with
statistically significant improvements in runtime (-25%) and heap memory
consumption (-15%) compared to DynaMOSA. Additionally, aDynaMOSA has comparable
results to DynaMOSA over seven different coverage criteria and similar fault
detection effectiveness. Our empirical investigation also highlights that the
usage of performance proxies (i.e., without the adaptiveness) is not sufficient
to generate more performant test cases without compromising the overall
coverage.

asks for the position of an element whose frequency in the query range is at
most a factor $(1+\epsilon)$ smaller than the true mode. For this problem, we
design an $O(n/\epsilon)$ bit data structure supporting queries in
$O(\lg(1/\epsilon))$ time. This is an encoding data structure which does not
require access to the input sequence; we prove the space cost is asymptotically
optimal for constant $\epsilon$. Our solution improves the previous best result
of Greve et al. (Cell Probe Lower Bounds and Approximations for Range Mode,
ICALP'10) by reducing the space cost by a factor of $\lg n$ while achieving the

answers queries in $O(\lg n /\lg\lg n)$ time and supports insertions and
deletions in $O(\lg n)$ time, for any constant $\epsilon \in (0,1)$. This is
the first result on dynamic approximate range mode; it can also be used to
obtain the first static data structure for approximate 3-sided range mode

  We also consider approximate range selection. For any $\alpha \in (0,1/2)$,
an $\alpha$-approximate range selection query asks for the position of an
element whose rank in the query range is in $[k - \alpha s, k + \alpha s]$,
where $k$ is a rank given by the query and $s$ is the size of the query range.
When $\alpha$ is a constant, we design an $O(n)$-bit encoding data structure
that can answer queries in constant time and prove this space cost is
asymptotically optimal. The previous best result by Krizanc et al. (Range Mode
and Range Median Queries on Lists and Trees, Nordic Journal of Computing, 2005)
uses $O(n\lg n)$ bits, or $O(n)$ words, to achieve constant approximation for
range median only. Thus we not only improve the space cost, but also provide
support for any arbitrary $k$ given at query time.

produce: conventional high aspect ratio isolated emitters are not required to
be formed on the surface, and the actual emitter surface roughness is on the
order of only 100~nm. Careful reliability assessment of (N)UNCD is required
before it may find routine application in accelerator systems. In the present
study using an L-band normal conducting single-cell rf gun, a (N)UNCD cathode
has been conditioned to $\sim$42~MV/m in a well-controlled manner. It reached a
maximum output charge of 15~nC corresponding to an average current of 6~mA
during an emission period of 2.5~$\mu$s. Imaging of emission current revealed a
large number of isolated emitters (density over 100/cm$^{2}$) distributed on
the cathode, which is consistent with previous tests in dc environments. The
performance metrics, the emission imaging, and the systematic study of emission
properties during rf conditioning in a wide gradient range assert (N)UNCD as an

scientific applications. These studies also improve the fundamental knowledge
of the practical conditioning procedure via better understanding of emission
mechanisms.

context, allows for the presence of hyperons in neutron stars having masses
larger than 2$M_{\odot}$. We find that the composition and structure of neutron
stars is critically influenced by the addition of the $\Delta$ isobars, which
allows us to constrain their interaction with the meson fields taking into
account astrophysical information. Imposing that the EoS is stable and ensures
the existence of 2$M_{\odot}$ neutron stars, as well as requiring agreement
with data of $\Delta$ excitation in nuclei, we find that, in the absence of
other mechanisms stiffening the EoS at high densities, the interaction of the
$\Delta$ isobars with the sigma and omega meson fields must be at least 10\%
stronger than that of the nucleons. Moreover, the neutron star moment of
inertia turns out to be sensitive to the presence of $\Delta$ isobars, whereas
the inclusion of $\Delta$ isobars in the EoS allows for smaller stellar radii
and for a lower value of the tidal deformability consistent with the analysis
of the GW170817 merger event.

localize bugs. In the literature, many researchers proposed state-of-the-art
bug localization models to help developers localize bugs easily. The
practitioners, on the other hand, expect a bug localization tool to meet
certain criteria, such as trustworthiness, scalability, and efficiency. The
current models are not capable of meeting these criteria, making it harder to
adopt these models in practice. Recently, deep-learning-based bug localization
models have been proposed in the literature, which show a better performance
than the state-of-the-art models.
  Aim: In this research, we would like to investigate whether deep learning
models meet the expectations of practitioners or not.
  Method: We constructed a Convolution Neural Network and a Simple Logistic
model to examine their effectiveness in localizing bugs. We train these models
on five open source projects written in Java and compare their performance with
the performance of other state-of-the-art models trained on these datasets.
  Results: Our experiments show that although the deep learning models perform
better than classic machine learning models, they meet the adoption criteria
set by the practitioners only partially.
  Conclusions: This work provides evidence that the practitioners should be
cautious while using the current state of the art models for production-level
use-cases. It also highlights the need for standardization of performance
benchmarks to ensure that bug localization models are assessed equitably and
realistically.

addressed from the (a priori distinct) perspectives of numerical approximation,
statistical inference and deep learning. Could its analysis through these
combined perspectives be used as a Rosetta stone for deciphering mechanisms at
play in deep learning? Motivated by this question we introduce programmable and
interpretable regression networks for pattern recognition and address mode
decomposition as a prototypical problem. The programming of these networks is
achieved by assembling elementary modules decomposing and recomposing kernels
and data. These elementary steps are repeated across levels of abstraction and
interpreted from the equivalent perspectives of optimal recovery, game theory
and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The prototypical mode/kernel
decomposition module produces an optimal approximation $(w_1,w_2,\cdots,w_m)$
of an element $(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_m)$ of a product of Hilbert subspaces of a
common Hilbert space from the observation of the sum $v:=v_1+\cdots+v_m$. The
prototypical mode/kernel recomposition module performs partial sums of the
recovered modes $w_i$ based on the alignment between each recovered mode $w_i$
and the data $v$. We illustrate the proposed framework by programming
regression networks approximating the modes $v_i=
a_i(t)y_i\big(\theta_i(t)\big)$ of a (possibly noisy) signal $\sum_i v_i$ when
the amplitudes $a_i$, instantaneous phases $\theta_i$ and periodic waveforms
$y_i$ may all be unknown and show near machine precision recovery under
regularity and separation assumptions on the instantaneous amplitudes $a_i$ and

intriguing similarities with convolutional neural networks while being

remains mired in controversy. Characterizing the formation loci and the dust

crucial for understanding the physics that underlie the mass-loss phenomenon.
By exploiting interferometric polarimetry, we derive the fundamental parameters
that govern the dust structure at the wind base of a red supergiant. We present
near-infrared aperture-masking observations of Betelgeuse in polarimetric mode
obtained with the NACO/SAMPol instrument. We used both parametric models and
radiative transfer simulations to predict polarimetric differential visibility
data and compared them to SPHERE/ZIMPOL measurements. Using a thin dust shell
model, we report the discovery of a dust halo that is located at only 0.5
R$_{\star}$ above the photosphere (i.e. an inner radius of the dust halo of 1.5
R$_{\star}$). By fitting the data under the assumption of Mie scattering, we
estimate the grain size and density for various dust species. By extrapolating
to the visible wavelengths using radiative transfer simulations, we compare our
model with SPHERE/ZIMPOL data and find that models based on dust mixtures that
are dominated by forsterite are most favored. Such a close dusty atmosphere has
profound implications for the dust formation mechanisms around red supergiants.

laser-atom experiments is a demanding computational task, even in
single-active-electron approximation. The QPROP code, published in 2006, has
been extended in 2016 in order to provide the possibility to calculate PES
using the so-called t-SURFF approach [L. Tao, A. Scrinzi, New J. Phys. 14,
013021 (2012)]. In t-SURFF, the flux through a surface while the laser is on is
monitored. Calculating PES from this flux through a surface enclosing a
relatively small computational grid is much more efficient than calculating it
from the widely spread wavefunction at the end of the laser pulse on a much
larger grid. However, the smaller the minimum photoelectron energy of interest
is, the more post-propagation after the actual laser pulse is necessary. This
drawback of t-SURFF has been overcome by Morales et al. [F. Morales, T.
Bredtmann, S. Patchkovskii, J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 49, 245001 (2016)]
by noticing that the propagation of the wavefunction from the end of the laser
pulse to infinity can be performed very efficiently in a single step. In this
work, we introduce QPROP 3.0, in which this single-step post-propagation
(dubbed i-SURFV) is added. Examples, illustrating the new feature, are
discussed. A few other improvements, concerning mainly the parameter files, are
also explained.

this work we took inspiration from the fruit fly brain to formulate a novel
machine learning algorithm that is able to optimize the sparsity level of a

applied on the readout layer so as not to change the timescales of the

the standard gradient descent, which is limited to the readout weights of the

monic and quadratic and $\rho_f$ be the arboreal Galois representation
associated to $f$, taking values in the group $\Omega_{\infty}$ of
automorphisms of the infinite binary tree. We give a complete description of
the maximal closed subgroups of each closed subgroup of index at most two of

universal functions evaluated in elements of the critical orbit of $f$. We use
such description in order to derive necessary and sufficient criteria for the
image of $\rho_f$ to be a given subgroup of index two of $\Omega_\infty$. These
depend exclusively on the arithmetic of the critical orbit of $f$. Afterwards,
we prove that if $\phi=x^2+t\in\mathbb Q(t)[x]$, then there exist exactly five
distinct subgroups of index two of $\Omega_{\infty}$ that can appear as images
of $\rho_{\phi_{t_0}}$ for infinitely many $t_0\in\mathbb Q$, where
$\phi_{t_0}$ is the specialized polynomial. We show that two of them appear
infinitely often, and if Vojta's conjecture over $\mathbb Q$ holds true, then
so do the remaining ones. Finally, we give an explicit description of the
derived series of each subgroup of index two. Using this, we introduce a
sequence of combinatorial invariants for subgroups of index two of
$\Omega_\infty$. With a delicate use of these invariants we are able to
establish that such subgroups are pairwise non-isomorphic as topological
groups, a result of independent interest. This implies, in particular, that the
five aforementioned groups are pairwise distinct topological groups, and
therefore yield five genuinely different instances of the infinite inverse

a sub-solar gas-phase metallicity of ~ 0.3 Z$_\odot$. Intriguingly, comparing

in terms of specific star-formation rate and gas fraction. However, it does not
explain how a galaxy can amass such a large stellar population while

the H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($W_{\text{H}\alpha}$). From a set of 1,409 SF
galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey, we calculate
the fractional contribution of the DIG to several emission lines using
high-$S/N$ data from SF spaxels (instead of using noisy emission-lines in
DIG-dominated spaxels). Our method is applicable to spectra with observed
$W_{\text{H}\alpha} \gtrsim 10$ angstroms (which are not dominated by DIG
emission). Since the DIG contribution depends on galactocentric distance, we
provide DIG-correction formulae for both entire galaxies and single aperture
spectra. Applying those to a sample of $\,> 90,000$ SF galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, we find the following. (1) The effect of the DIG on
strong-line abundances depends on the index used. It is negligible for the ([O
III]/H$\beta$)/([N II]/H$\alpha$) index, but reaches $\sim 0.1$ dex at the
high-metallicity end for [N II]/H$\alpha$. (2) This result is based on the
$\sim$kpc MaNGA resolution, so the real effect of the DIG is likely greater.
(3) We revisit the mass-metallicity-star formation rate (SFR) relation by
correcting for the DIG contribution in both abundances and SFR. The effect of
DIG removal is more prominent at higher stellar masses. Using the [N
II]/H$\alpha$ index, O/H increases with SFR at high stellar mass, contrary to
previous claims.

goal of 1% precision. A major obstacle comes in the form of lensing
degeneracies, such as the mass sheet degeneracy (MSD), which make it possible
for a family of density profiles to reproduce the same lensing observables but
return different values of $H_0$. The modeling process artificially selects one
choice from this family, potentially biasing $H_0$. The effect is more
pronounced when the profile of a given lens is not perfectly described by the
lens model, which will always be the case to some extent. To explore this, we
quantify the bias and spread in $H_0$ by creating quads from two-component mass
models and fitting them with a power-law ellipse+shear model. We find that the
bias does not correspond to the estimate one would calculate by transforming
the profile into a power law near the image radius. We also emulate the effect
of including stellar kinematics by performing fits where the slope is
constrained to the true value. Informing the fit using the true value near the
image radius can introduce substantial bias (0-23% depending on the model). We
confirm using Jeans arguments that kinematic constraints can result in a biased
value of $H_0$, though the degree of bias depends on the region kinematic
modeling probes in specific lenses. We conclude that lensing degeneracies
manifest through commonplace modeling approaches in a more complicated way than
is assumed in the literature. If stellar kinematics incorrectly break the MSD,
their inclusion may introduce more bias than their omission.

convex combination of Fock states with different values of Planck's constant.
The second important class of states we study are the KMS-states, here the
rescaling alters in a nontrivial way the relevant dynamics. We also show that

optimize a sequence of objective functions that use network parameters obtained

rides along the peak of the evolving (negative) empirical risk function,
starting from a smooth surface at the beginning of learning and ending with a

fast collisions between two solitons of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS)
equation in the presence of weak cubic loss. We calculate the radiation
dynamics by a perturbation technique with two small parameters: the cubic loss
coefficient $\epsilon_{3}$ and the reciprocal of the group velocity difference
$1/\beta$. The agreement between the perturbation theory predictions and the
results of numerical simulations with the full coupled-NLS propagation model is
very good for large $\beta$ values, and is good for intermediate $\beta$
values. Additional numerical simulations with four simplified NLS models show
that the differences between perturbation theory and simulations for
intermediate $\beta$ values are due to the effects of Kerr nonlinearity on
interpulse interaction in the collision. Thus, our study demonstrates that the
perturbation technique that was originally developed to study radiation
dynamics in fast soliton collisions in the presence of conservative
perturbations can also be employed for soliton collisions in the presence of
dissipative perturbations.

linkage algorithms extended with a machine learning approach to account for
short company names. Linkage time is greatly reduced by efficient decomposition
of the search space using MinHash. High linkage accuracy is achieved by the

and the sources and propagation of energetic particles between the Sun and
observers. A recently developed mapping approach is generalised to use a more
advanced solar wind model that includes the effects of solar wind acceleration,
non-radial intrinsic magnetic fields and flows at the source surface/inner
boundary, and conservation of angular momentum. The field lines are mapped by
stepping along local magnetic field $\bm{B}$ and via a Runge-Kutta algorithm,
leading to essentially identical maps. The new model's maps for Carrington
rotation CR 1895 near solar minimum (19 April to 15 May 1995) and a solar
rotation between CR 2145 and CR 2146 near solar maximum (14 January to 9
February 2014) are compared with the published maps for a constant solar wind
model. The two maps are very similar on a large scale near both solar minimum
and solar maximum, meaning that the field line orientations, winding angles,
and connectivity generally agree very well. However, close inspection shows
that the field lines have notable small-scale structural differences. An
interpretation is that inclusion of the acceleration and intrinsic azimuthal
velocity has significant effects on the local structure of the magnetic field
lines. Interestingly, the field lines are more azimuthal for the accelerating
solar wind model for both intervals. In addition, predictions for the pitch
angle distributions (PADs) for suprathermal electrons agree at the $90$ --
$95\%$ level with observations for both solar wind models for both intervals.

order to determine whether this option may be less constricting. We find that
the observer is still constrained to a small region, but it is not as
geometrically ``special'' as the center of an LTB void. Furthermore, whereas
the quadrupole and octupole near the center of an LTB void are necessarily
small, certain Szekeres models can include a significant quadrupole while still
being consistent with the observed dipole, hinting that Szekeres models may be

technology in exploring quantum phenomena and their applications for decades.
For instance, traditional SPDC, which splits a high energy pump photon into two
lower energy photons, is a common way to produce entangled photon pairs. Since
the early realizations of SPDC, researchers have thought to generalize it to
higher order, e.g., to produce entangled photon triplets. However, directly
generating photon triplets through a single SPDC process has remained elusive.
Here, using a flux-pumped superconducting parametric cavity, we demonstrate
direct three-photon SPDC, with photon triplets generated in a single cavity
mode or split between multiple modes. With strong pumping, the states can be
quite bright, with flux densities exceeding 60 photon/s/Hz. The observed states
are strongly non-Gaussian, which has important implications for potential
applications. In the single-mode case, we observe a triangular star-shaped
distribution of quadrature voltages, indicative of the long-predicted ""star
state"". The observed star state shows strong third-order correlations, as
expected for a state generated by a cubic Hamiltonian. By pumping at the sum
frequency of multiple modes, we observe strong three-body correlations between
multiple modes, strikingly, in the absence of second-order correlations. We
further analyze the third-order correlations under mode transformations by the
symplectic symmetry group, showing that the observed transformation properties
serve to ""fingerprint"" the specific cubic Hamiltonian that generates them. The
observed non-Gaussian, third-order correlations represent an important step
forward in quantum optics and may have a strong impact on quantum communication
with microwave fields as well as continuous-variable quantum computation.

at phases $0.18$, $0.49$, $0.65$, together with literature photometric data,
using the latest-generation self-consistent dynamic atmosphere models for

the dust radii: $780$, $853$, $787$ R$_{\odot}$. The dynamic models can fairly
explain the observed $N$-band visibility and spectra, although there is some
discrepancy between the data and the models, which is discussed in the text.

support decision making of multi-objective problems. For conducting a MCDA, in
most cases a set of objectives (SOO) is required which consists of a
hierarchical structure with objectives, criteria and indicators. The
development of a SOO may require high organizational effort. This article
introduces elementary interactions as a key paradigm for the development of a
SOO. Elementary interactions are self-contained information requests that can
be answered with little cognitive effort, which are made and processed with the
help of a web platform. Each elementary interaction contributes to the stepwise
development of a SOO. Based on the hypothesis that a SOO can be developed
exclusively with elementary interactions, a platform concept is described.
Essential components of the platform are a Model Aggregator, an Elementary
Interaction Stream Generator, a Participant Manager and a Discussion Forum. The
platform concept has been evaluated in a pilot study using a web-based
prototype. In summary, the proposed concept demonstrates the potential to
advance the development of sets of objectives for MCDA applications: (1) The
platform concept does not restrict the application domain, (2) it is intended
to work with little administration efforts, (3) it lowers the organizational
effort for developing a SOO. (3) it supports the further development of an
existing SOO in the event of significant changes in external conditions. (4)
The development process of the SOO can be recorded by the platform and thus
becomes retraceable. The reproducibility may have a positive effect on the
spread of MCDA applications. The traceability and the use of elementary
interactions make the platform appear to be a suitable medium for Citizen
Science-based approaches to the development of MCDA applications.

this paper, we propose an interpretable human behavior model in interactive
driving scenarios based on the cumulative prospect theory (CPT). As a
non-expected utility theory, CPT can well explain some systematically biased or
``irrational'' behavior/decisions of human that cannot be explained by the
expected utility theory. Hence, the goal of this work is to formulate the human
drivers' behavior generation model with CPT so that some ``irrational''
behavior or decisions of human can be better captured and predicted. Towards
such a goal, we first develop a CPT-driven decision-making model focusing on
driving scenarios with two interacting agents. A hierarchical learning
algorithm is proposed afterward to learn the utility function, the value
function, and the decision weighting function in the CPT model. A case study
for roundabout merging is also provided as verification. With real driving
data, the prediction performances of three different models are compared: a
predefined model based on time-to-collision (TTC), a learning-based model based
on neural networks, and the proposed CPT-based model. The results show that the
proposed model outperforms the TTC model and achieves similar performance as
the learning-based model with much less training data and better

classical graph-theoretic measures are usually local and mainly based on
differences between either node or edge measurements or correlations without
considering the topology of networks such as the connected components or holes.
In recent years, mathematical tools and deep learning based methods have become
popular to extract the topological features of networks. Persistent homology
(PH) is a mathematical tool in computational topology that measures the
topological features of data that persist across multiple scales with
applications ranging from biological networks to social networks. In this
paper, we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of using
PH on complex network science. We give a brief mathematical background on PH,
review different methods (i.e. filtrations) to define PH on networks and
highlight different algorithms and applications where PH is used in solving
network mining problems. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to
describe these recent approaches and emphasize major conceptual distinctions.
We conclude with directions for future work. We focus our review on recent
approaches that get significant attention in the mathematics and data mining
communities working on network data. We believe our summary of the analysis of

integrated into our daily lives. People routinely use machine translation for
various applications, such as describing symptoms to a foreign doctor and
reading political news in a foreign language. However, the complexity and
intractability of neural machine translation (NMT) models that power modern
machine translation make the robustness of these systems difficult to even
assess, much less guarantee. Machine translation systems can return inferior
results that lead to misunderstanding, medical misdiagnoses, threats to
personal safety, or political conflicts. Despite its apparent importance,
validating the robustness of machine translation systems is very difficult and
has, therefore, been much under-explored.
  To tackle this challenge, we introduce structure-invariant testing (SIT), a
novel metamorphic testing approach for validating machine translation software.
Our key insight is that the translation results of ""similar"" source sentences
should typically exhibit similar sentence structures. Specifically, SIT (1)
generates similar source sentences by substituting one word in a given sentence
with semantically similar, syntactically equivalent words; (2) represents
sentence structure by syntax parse trees (obtained via constituency or
dependency parsing); (3) reports sentence pairs whose structures differ
quantitatively by more than some threshold. To evaluate SIT, we use it to test
Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 source sentences as
input, which led to 64 and 70 buggy issues with 69.5\% and 70\% top-1 accuracy,
respectively. The translation errors are diverse, including under-translation,
over-translation, incorrect modification, word/phrase mistranslation, and
unclear logic.

system-agnostic tool for building global potential energy surfaces (PES) of
polyatomic molecules. While the accuracy of GP models of PES increases with the
number of potential energy points, so does the numerical difficulty of training
and evaluating GP models. Here, we demonstrate an approach to improve the
accuracy of global PES without increasing the number of energy points. The
present work reports four important results. First, we show that the selection
of the best kernel function for GP models of PES can be automated using the
Bayesian information criterion as a model selection metric. Second, we
demonstrate that GP models of PES trained by a small number of energy points
can be significantly improved by iteratively increasing the complexity of GP
kernels. The composite kernels thus obtained maximize the accuracy of GP models
for a given distribution of potential energy points. Third, we show that the
accuracy of the GP models of PES with composite kernels can be further improved
by varying the training point distributions. Fourth, we show that GP models
with composite kernels can be used for physical extrapolation of PES. We
illustrate the approach by constructing the six-dimensional PES for H$_3$O$^+$.
For the interpolation problem, we show that this algorithm produces a global
six-dimensional PES for H$_3$O$^+$ in the energy range between zero and

in the square Co layers of SrCo$_{2}$As$_{2}$ below $T\approx100$ K centered at
the stripe-type AF propagation vector of $(\frac{1}{2},~\frac{1}{2})$, and that
their development is concomitant with a suppression of the uniform magnetic

switch in spectral weight as signaling a temperature-induced crossover from an
instability towards FM ordering to an instability towards stripe-type AF
ordering on cooling, and show results from Monte-Carlo simulations for a
$J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg model that illustrate how the crossover develops as
a function of the frustration ratio $-J_1/(2J_2)$. By putting our INS data on
an absolute scale, we quantitatively compare them and our magnetization data to
exact-diagonalization calculations for the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ model [N. Shannon et
al., Eur. Phys. J. B 38, 599 (2004)], and show that the calculations predict a
lower level of magnetic frustration than indicated by experiment. We trace this
discrepancy to the large energy scale of the fluctuations

more characteristic of itinerant magnetism.

situation to lean on a training dataset of a different domain. Sharing this
issue, object detection is a vital task for autonomous vehicles where the large
amount of driving scenarios yields several domains of application requiring
annotated data for the training process. In this work, a method for training a
car detection system with annotated data from a source domain (day images)
without requiring the image annotations of the target domain (night images) is
presented. For that, a model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is
explored to enable the generation of an artificial dataset with its respective
annotations. The artificial dataset (fake dataset) is created translating
images from day-time domain to night-time domain. The fake dataset, which
comprises annotated images of only the target domain (night images), is then
used to train the car detector model. Experimental results showed that the
proposed method achieved significant and consistent improvements, including the
increasing by more than 10% of the detection performance when compared to the

minimum multiway $k$-cut problem defined over static and dynamic {\em

a graph into $k$ subsets, such that each subset contains one prespecified node,
and the corresponding total cut weight is minimized. These problems arise in
many applications and are computationally complex (NP-hard). In the static
setting this article presents an approach that uses a relaxed multiway $k$-cut
cost function; we show that the resulting algorithm converges to a local
minimum. This iterative algorithm is designed to avoid poor local minima with
its run-time complexity as $\sim O(kIN^3)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices
and $I$ is the number of iterations. In the dynamic setting, the edge-weight
matrix has an associated dynamics with some of the edges in the graph capable
of being influenced by an external input. The objective is to design the
dynamics of the controllable edges so that multiway $k$-cut value remains small
(or decreases) as the graph evolves under the dynamics. Also it is required to
determine the time-varying partition that defines the minimum multiway $k$-cut
value. Our approach is to choose a relaxation of multiway $k$-cut value,
derived using maximum entropy principle, and treat it as a control Lyapunov
function to design control laws that affect the weight dynamics. Simulations on
practical examples of interactive foreground-background segmentation, minimum
multiway $k$-cut optimization for non-planar graphs and dynamically evolving
graphs that demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm, are presented.

proposes a blockchain based TES that enables agents to receive incentives for
providing voltage regulation services by i) maintaining an auditable reputation

a voltage violation, ii) utilizing smart contracts to enforce the validity of
each transaction and penalize reputation ratings in case of a mitigation

implementing the contract net protocol (CNP) as a smart contract. Experimental
results on both simulated and real-world ADNs are executed to demonstrate the

estimate the impacted units of a software change. Starting from a single
impacted unit, the developers inspect its interacting units via program
dependencies to identify the ones that are also impacted, and this process
continues iteratively. Experience has shown that developers often miss impacted
units and inspect many irrelevant units. In this work, we study propagation
heuristics that guide developers to find the actual impacted units and
termination heuristics that help to decide whether the estimated impact is
complete. The roles of these two kinds of heuristics are complementary and
affect both the precision and recall when used during IIA. We investigated
several propagation heuristics adapted from previously published papers and
combined them with a practical termination heuristic. We developed a
reenactment process that simulates the actions of developers who use those
heuristics during IIA, and we assessed their performance. The software changes
for our reenactment were mined from the repositories of open source projects.
We found that IIA provides better recall than the other known impact analysis
techniques. However the IIA with the propagation heuristics that we
investigated does not supersede IIA combined with a random inspection, and
hence these heuristics do not help the IIA.

This approach offers computational feasibility and interpretable time-frequency

obtain posterior estimates of the time-varying spectral densities of individual
time series components, as well as posterior measurements of the time-frequency
relationships across multiple components, such as time-varying coherence and
partial coherence.
  The proposed formulation considers multivariate dynamic linear models (MDLMs)
on the forward and backward time-varying partial autocorrelation coefficients
(TV-VPARCOR). Computationally expensive schemes for posterior inference on the
multivariate dynamic PARCOR model are avoided using approximations in the MDLM
context. Approximate inference on the corresponding time-varying vector
autoregressive (TV-VAR) coefficients is obtained via Whittle's algorithm. A key
aspect of the proposed TV-VPARCOR representations is that they are of lower
dimension, and therefore more efficient, than TV-VAR representations. The
performance of the TV-VPARCOR models is illustrated in simulation studies and
in the analysis of multivariate non-stationary temporal data arising in
neuroscience and environmental applications. Model performance is evaluated
using goodness-of-fit measurements in the time-frequency domain and also by
assessing the quality of short-term forecasting.

is equivalent to the AdWords problem where item truncation is not allowed. We
derive a randomized threshold algorithm for this problem which is
0.214-competitive. We also show that any randomized algorithm for this problem
cannot be more than 0.461-competitive, providing the first upper bound which is
strictly less than 0.5. This online knapsack problem finds applications in many
areas, like supply chain ordering, online advertising, and healthcare
scheduling, refugee integration, and crowdsourcing. We show how our optimal
threshold distributions can be naturally implemented in the warehouses for a
Latin American chain department store. We run simulations on their large-scale

anonymization algorithm can only output numeric term vectors which are

augmenting the semantic information through a REINFORCE training reward
function, the model can generate differentially private text that has a close
semantic and similar grammatical structure to the original text while removing
personal traits of the writing style. It does not assume any conditioned labels
or paralleled text data for training. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed model on the real-life peer reviews dataset and the Yelp review

wave propagation. Summation-by-parts--simultaneous approximation term (SBP-SAT)
finite difference methods are often used for such equations, as they combine
computational efficiency with provable stability on curvilinear multiblock
grids. However, the existing SBP-SAT discretization of the Laplacian quickly
becomes prohibitively stiff as grid skewness increases. The stiffness stems
from the SATs that impose inter-block couplings and Dirichlet boundary
conditions. We resolve this issue by deriving stable SATs whose stiffness is
almost insensitive to grid skewness. The new discretization thus allows for
large time steps in explicit time integrators, even on very skewed grids. It
also applies to the variable-coefficient generalization of the Laplacian. We
demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the new method by applying it to
acoustic wave propagation problems inspired by marine seismic exploration and
infrasound monitoring of volcanoes.

continuous Signal Alignment algorithm with Gaussian Process Regression profiles
(SA-GPR). SA-GPR addresses the limitations of currently available signal
alignment methods by adopting a hybrid of the particle smoothing and
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to align signals, and by applying
the Gaussian process regression to construct profiles to be aligned
continuously. SA-GPR shares all the strengths of the existing alignment
algorithms that depend on profiles but is more exact in the sense that profiles
do not need to be discretized as sequential bins. The uncertainty of
performance over the resolution of such bins is thereby eliminated. This
methodology produces alignments that are consistent, that regularize extreme
cases, and that properly reflect the inherent uncertainty.
  Then we extend SA-GPR to a specific problem in the field of paleoceanography
with a method called Bayesian Inference Gaussian Process Multiproxy Alignment
of Continuous Signals (BIGMACS). The goal of BIGMACS is to infer continuous
ages for ocean sediment cores using two classes of age proxies: proxies that
explicitly return calendar ages (e.g., radiocarbon) and those used to
synchronize ages in multiple marine records (e.g., an oxygen isotope based
marine proxy known as benthic ${\delta}^{18}{\rm O}$). BIGMACS integrates these
two proxies by iteratively performing two steps: profile construction from
benthic ${\delta}^{18}{\rm O}$ age models and alignment of each core to the
profile also reflecting radiocarbon dates. We use BIGMACS to construct a new
Deep Northeastern Atlantic stack (i.e., a profile from a particular benthic
${\delta}^{18}{\rm O}$ records) of five ocean sediment cores. We conclude by
constructing multiproxy age models for two additional cores from the same
region by aligning them to the stack.

real-time initialization enables a factor-of-20 speedup over traditional

guarantees for deciding when an ensemble is ""large enough"" --- so that its
accuracy is close to that of an ideal infinite ensemble. Due to the fact that
bagging and random forests are randomized algorithms, the choice of ensemble
size is closely related to the notion of ""algorithmic variance"" (i.e. the
variance of prediction error due only to the training algorithm). In the
present work, we propose a bootstrap method to estimate this variance for
bagging, random forests, and related methods in the context of classification.
To be specific, suppose the training dataset is fixed, and let the random

$t$. Working under a ""first-order model"" for randomized ensembles, we prove
that the centered law of $Err_t$ can be consistently approximated via the

method is quite modest, by virtue of an extrapolation technique. As a
consequence, the method offers a practical guideline for deciding when the
algorithmic fluctuations of $Err_t$ are negligible.

bounds for the two archetypal information constraints of communication and
local privacy, and show that our sample complexity bounds are optimal as a

the filament south-western footpoint during these jets. In this paper, we
mainly focus on the material supply of the filament. The plasma mass uploaded
by the jets and the mass of the filament are estimated, which manifests the
fact that the mass carried by jets can supply sufficient material for the

  Cloud-Based Small Cell Networks: An MDS Codes-Aided Approach","To appear in IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of cloud-based small cell networks (C-SCNs) relies highly on
a capacity-limited fronthaul, which degrade quality of service when it is
saturated. Coded caching is a promising approach to addressing these
challenges, as it provides abundant opportunities for fronthaul multicast and
cooperative transmissions. This paper investigates a cache-enabled C-SCNs, in
which small-cell base stations (SBSs) are connected to the central processor
via fronthaul, and can prefetch popular contents by applying maximum distance
separable (MDS) codes. To fully capture the benefits of fronthaul multicast and
cooperative transmissions, an MDS codes-aided transmission scheme is first
proposed. We formulate the problem to minimize the content delivery latency by
jointly optimizing fronthaul bandwidth allocation, SBS clustering, and
beamforming. To efficiently solve the resulting nonlinear integer programming
problem, we propose a penalty-based design by leveraging variational
reformulations of binary constraints. To improve the solution of the
penalty-based design, a greedy SBS clustering design is also developed.
Furthermore, closed-form characterization of the optimal solution is obtained,
through which the benefits of MDS codes can be quantified. Simulation results
are given to demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed MDS
codes-aided transmission scheme.

  Access Networks","submitted for publication",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers computation offloading in fog-radio access networks
(F-RAN), where multiple user equipments (UEs) offload their computation tasks
to the F-RAN through a number of fog nodes. Each UE can choose one of the fog
nodes to offload its task, and each fog node may serve multiple UEs. Depending
on the computation burden at the fog nodes, the tasks may be computed by the
fog nodes or further offloaded to the cloud via capacity-limited fronthaul
links. To compute all UEs' tasks as fast as possible, joint optimization of
UE-Fog association, radio and computation resources of F-RAN is proposed to
minimize the maximum latency of all UEs. This min-max problem is formulated as
a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINP). We first show that the MINP can be
reformulated as a continuous optimization problem, and then employ the
majorization minimization (MM) approach to find a solution. The MM approach
that we develop is unconventional in that -- each MM subproblem can be solved
inexactly with the same provable convergence guarantee as the conventional
exact MM, thereby reducing the complexity of each MM iteration. In addition, we
also consider a cooperative offloading model, where the fog nodes
compress-and-forward their received signals to the cloud. Under this model, a
similar min-max latency optimization problem is formulated and tackled again by
the inexact MM approach. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms
outperform some heuristic offloading strategies, and that the cooperative
offloading can better exploit the transmission diversity to attain better
latency performance than the non-cooperative one.

branching ratio for this decay is within the range of $3.72\times 10^{-5}$ to
$11.16\times10^{-5}$ and in our estimating the theoretical result by using the
QCD factorization approaches is $10^2$ times less than experimental one (we
have obtained $1.41\times10^{-7}$), it is decided to calculate the theoretical
branching ratio by applying the final state interaction (FSI) through the T and
cross section channels. In this process, before the $B^+_c$ meson decays into
two final state mesons of $D^0K^+$, it first decays into two intermediate
mesons like $J/\psi D^{*+}_s$, then these two mesons transformed into two final
mesons by exchanging another meson like $D^0$. The FSI effects are very
sensitive to the changes in the phenomenological parameter that appear in the
form factor relation, as in most calculation changing two units in this
parameter, makes the final result multiply in the branching ratio, therefor the
decision to use FSI is not unexpected. In this study there are nineteen
intermediate states in which the contribution of each one is calculated and
summed in the final amplitude. Therefore, the numerical value of the branching
ratio of $B^+_c\rightarrow D^0K^+$ decay is obtained by calculating the FSI
effects from $1.17\times10^{-5}$ to $11.65\times10^{-5}$ which is consistent

making simplistic assumptions on arrival and departure processes to keep the

generally be formulated as stochastic optimization problems where the objective
and constraint are non-linear functions of expectations. The compositional
structure obviates the use of classical stochastic approximation approaches
where the stochastic gradients are often required to be unbiased. To this end,
a constrained stochastic compositional gradient descent algorithm is proposed
that utilizes a tracking step for the expected value functions. The
non-asymptotic performance of the proposed algorithm is characterized via its
iteration complexity. Numerical tests allow us to validate the theoretical
results and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

  Journal of Fluid Mechanics",,"10.1017/jfm.2019.622",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Exact Regularized Point Particle (ERPP) method is extended to treat the
interphase momentum coupling between particles and fluid in the presence of
walls by accounting for the vorticity generation due to the particles close to
solid boundaries. The ERPP method overcomes the limitations of other methods by
allowing the simulation of an extensive parameter space (Stokes number, mass
loading, particle-to-fluid density ratio and Reynolds number) and of particle
spatial distributions that are uneven (few particles per computational cell).
The enhanced ERPP method is explained in detail and validated by considering
the global impulse balance. In conditions when particles are located close to
the wall, a common scenario in wall-bounded turbulent flows, the main
contribution to the total impulse arises from the particle-induced vorticity at
the solid boundary. The method is applied to direct numerical simulations of
particle-laden turbulent pipe flow in the two-way coupling regime to address
the turbulence modulation. The effects of the mass loading, the Stokes number
and the particle-to-fluid density ratio are investigated. The drag is either
unaltered or increased by the particles with respect to the uncoupled case. No
drag reduction is found in the parameter space considered. The momentum stress
budget, which includes an extra stress contribution by the particles, provides
the rationale behind the drag behaviour. The extra stress produces a momentum
flux towards the wall that strongly modifies the viscous stress, the culprit of
drag at solid boundaries.

high spin (HS) and low spin (LS) states along with $d^6$ and $d^7$ charge
configurations indicating the dynamically fluctuating nature of spin and charge

insulating state and favor HS with a $d^6$ configuration, while more covalent
Co sites with the short Co-O bonds occupy more LS states with a $d^7$

induced in the BD structure from the spin-state ordering. We also find that
both energetics and electronic structure sensitively depend on the Co-O

pairwise attractive square well potential accounting for the hydrophobic effect

breaking of spurious symmetries. First, we allow the partial interpenetration
of consecutive beads. In addition to the standard high temperature coil phase

real proteins. This leads to the emergence of a novel phase within the
previously obtained marginally compact phase, with the appearance of more
complex secondary structure assemblies. The potential importance of this new
phase in the \textit{de novo} design of self-assembled peptides is highlighted.

automatic detection and tracking of CMEs has proven to be crucial. The
excellent performance of convolutional neural network in image classification,

CME detection and tracking as well. We have developed a new tool for CME
Automatic detection and tracking with MachinE Learning (CAMEL) techniques. The
system is a three-module pipeline. It is first a supervised image
classification problem. We solve it by training a neural network LeNet with
training labels obtained from an existing CME catalog. Those images containing
CME structures are flagged as CME images. Next, to identify the CME region in
each CME-flagged image, we use deep descriptor transforming to localize the
common object in an image set. A following step is to apply the graph cut
technique to finely tune the detected CME region. To track the CME in an image
sequence, the binary images with detected CME pixels are converted from
cartesian to polar coordinate. A CME event is labeled if it can move in at
least two frames and reach the edge of coronagraph field of view. For each
event, a few fundamental parameters are derived. The results of four
representative CMEs with various characteristics are presented and compared
with those from four existing automatic and manual catalogs. We find that CAMEL
can detect more complete and weaker structures, and has better performance to
catch a CME as early as possible.

hierarchy of dipolar and exchange interactions as $N_{IX}$ increases. The
interlayer biexciton ($N_{IX}=2$) is found to be an emission doublet that is
blue-shifted from the single exciton by $\Delta E=(8.4\pm0.6)$ meV and split by
$2J=(1.2\pm0.5)$ meV. The blueshift is even more pronounced for triexcitons

significant performance improvements in data mining and machine learning tasks.
Therefore, it is interesting to explore whether sorting can also speed up by
deep learning techniques. In this paper, a neural network-based data
distribution aware sorting method named NN-sort is presented. Compared to
traditional comparison-based sorting algorithms, which need to compare the data
elements in pairwise, NN-sort leverages the neural network model to learn the
data distribution and uses it to map disordered data elements into ordered
ones. Although the complexity of NN-sort is $nlogn$ in theory, it can run in
near-linear time as being observed in most of the cases. Experimental results
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that NN-sort yields performance
improvement by up to 10.9x over traditional sorting algorithms.

distributed computation. Coded matrix multiplication is a recently introduced
technique that enables straggler-resistant distributed multiplication of large
matrices. A key property is that the finishing time depends only on the work
completed by a set of the fastest workers, while the work done by the slowest
workers is ignored completely. This paper is motivated by the observation that
in real-world commercial cloud computing systems such as Amazon's Elastic
Compute Cloud (EC2) the distinction between fast and slow nodes is often a soft
one. Thus, if we could also exploit the work completed by stragglers we may
realize substantial performance gains. To realize such gains, in this paper we
use the idea of hierarchical coding (Ferdinand and Draper, IEEE Int. Symp. Inf.
Theory, 2018). We decompose the overall matrix multiplication task into a
hierarchy of heterogeneously sized subtasks. The duty to complete each subtask
is shared amongst all workers and each subtask is (generally) of a different
complexity. The motivation for the hierarchical decomposition is the
recognition that more workers will finish the first subtask than the second (or
third, forth, etc.). Connecting to error correction coding, earlier subtasks
can therefore be designed to be of a higher rate than later subtasks. Through
this hierarchical design our scheme exploits the work completed by stragglers,
rather than ignoring it, even if that amount is much less than that completed
by the fastest workers. We numerically show that our method realizes a 60%
improvement in the expected finishing time for a widely studied statistical
model of the speed of computation and, on Amazon EC2, the gain is 35%.

However, existing part-based representation models mostly extract the features

a novel deep learning framework, named Part-based Hierarchical Graph

PH-GCN first constructs a hierarchical graph to represent the pairwise

nodes information into account for part feature representation. Finally, a
perceptron layer is adopted for the final person part label prediction and
re-identification. The proposed framework provides a general solution that
integrates local, global and structural feature learning simultaneously in a

networks, that ionize and swell when dispersed in a good solvent. Swelling of
these permeable, compressible particles involves a balance of electrostatic,
elastic, and mixing contributions to the single-particle osmotic pressure. The
electrostatic contribution depends on the distributions of mobile counterions
and coions and of fixed charge on the polymers. Within the cell model, we
employ two complementary methods to derive the electrostatic osmotic pressure
of ionic microgels. In Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory, we minimize a free energy
functional with respect to the electrostatic potential to obtain the bulk
pressure. From the pressure tensor, we extract the electrostatic and gel
contributions to the total pressure. In a statistical mechanical approach, we
vary the free energy with respect to microgel size to obtain exact relations
for the microgel electrostatic osmotic pressure. We present results for planar,
cylindrical, and spherical geometries. For models of membranes and microgels
with fixed charge uniformly distributed over their surface or volume, we derive
analogues of the contact value theorem for charged colloids. We validate these
relations by solving the PB equation and computing ion densities and osmotic
pressures. When implemented within PB theory, the two methods yield identical
electrostatic osmotic pressures for surface-charged microgels. For
volume-charged microgels, the exact electrostatic osmotic pressure equals the
average of the corresponding PB profile over the gel volume. We demonstrate
that swelling of ionic microgels depends on variation of the electrostatic
pressure inside the particle and discuss implications for interpreting
experiments.

machine learning using program notations and reasoning about these models using
generic inference engines. Recently its combination with deep learning has been
explored intensely, leading to the development of deep probabilistic
programming languages such as Pyro. At the core of this development lie
inference engines based on stochastic variational inference algorithms. When
asked to find information about the posterior distribution of a model written
in such a language, these algorithms convert this posterior-inference query
into an optimisation problem and solve it approximately by gradient ascent. In
this paper, we analyse one of the most fundamental and versatile variational
inference algorithms, called score estimator, using tools from denotational
semantics and program analysis. We formally express what this algorithm does on
models denoted by programs, and expose implicit assumptions made by the
algorithm. The violation of these assumptions may lead to an undefined
optimisation objective or the loss of convergence guarantee of the optimisation
process. We then describe rules for proving these assumptions, which can be
automated by static program analyses. Some of our rules use nontrivial facts
from continuous mathematics, and let us replace requirements about integrals in
the assumptions, by conditions involving differentiation or boundedness, which
are much easier to prove automatically. Following our general methodology, we
have developed a static program analysis for Pyro that aims at discharging the
assumption about what we call model-guide support match. Applied to the eight
representative model-guide pairs from the Pyro webpage, our analysis finds a
bug in one of these cases, reveals a non-standard use of an inference engine in
another, and shows the assumptions are met in the remaining cases.

like Bitcoin, is due to spent computation; it is work precisely because it
cannot be performed for free. In general, more resources provably lost in
producing blocks yields more security for the blockchain. When two blockchains
share the same mechanism for providing opportunity cost, as is the case when
they share the same PoW algorithm, the two chains compete for resources from
block producers. Indeed, if there exists a liquid market between resource
types, then theoretically all blockchains will compete for resources. In this
paper, we show that there exists a resource allocation equilibrium between any
two blockchains, which is essentially driven by the fiat value of reward that
each chain offers in return for providing security. We go on to prove that this
equilibrium is singular and always achieved provided that block producers
behave in a greedy, but cautious fashion. The opposite is true when they are
overly greedy: resource allocation oscillates in extremes between the two
chains. We show that these results hold both in practice and in a block

blockchains whose coins have lower fiat value, and a quantification of cost to
allocating resources away from the equilibrium.

been previously observed that $\mathbb{S}$ is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the
coalgebra obtained by completing the initial algebra, where the latter was
observed to be final when morphisms are restricted to short maps. This raised
the question ""Is $\mathbb{S}$ the final coalgebra in the Lipschitz setting?"".
The results of this paper show that the natural setup is to consider all
continuous functions. The description of the final coalgebra as the Cauchy
completion of the initial algebra has been explicitly used to determine the
mediating morphism from a given coalgebra to the the final coalgebra. This has
been used to show that if the structure map of a coalgebra is continuous, then
so is the mediating morphism. The description of $\mathbb{S}$ given here not
only generalizes previous observations, but also unifies classical descriptions
of $\mathbb{S}$. We also show, by means of an example, that $\mathbb{S}$ is not

This raises the question about the fate of magnetic-moments in intermediate,

local moment and the conduction band electrons is predicted to drive a quantum
phase-transition between a local-moment phase and a Kondo-screened singlet
phase as illustrated in Fig. 1A. However, attempts to experimentally confirm
these predictions and their intriguing consequences such as the ability to
electrostatically tune magnetic-moments, have been elusive. Here we report the
observation of Kondo screening and the quantum phase-transition between

scanning-tunneling-microscopy (STM), spectroscopy (STS) and
numerical-renormalization-group (NRG) calculations, we identified
Kondo-screening by its spectroscopic signature and mapped the quantum
phase-transition as a function of coupling strength and chemical potential. We
show that the coupling strength can be tuned across this transition by
variations in the local curvature and furthermore that the transition makes it
possible to turn the magnetic-moment on and off with a gate voltage.

However, there has not been much research in developing recommendation systems

apply for bidding loans, where the interest rate is determined by lenders
bidding on a loan or traditional loans where the P2PL platform determines the

reconstruct high-resolution urban DEMs. The proposed multi-scale CNN model is
firstly trained using urban DEMs that contain topographic features at different
resolutions, and then used to reconstruct the urban DEM at a specified (high)
resolution from a low-resolution equivalent. A two-level accuracy assessment
approach is also designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed urban DEM
reconstruction method, in terms of numerical accuracy and morphological
accuracy. The proposed DEM reconstruction approach is applied to a 121 km2

based image registration methods traditionally used hand-crafted feature
extraction algorithms, which detect key points in an image and describe them
using a region around the point. Such features are matched using a threshold
either on distances or ratio of distances computed between the feature
descriptors. Evolution of deep learning, in particular convolution neural
networks, has enabled researchers to address several problems of vision such as
recognition, tracking, localization etc. Outputs of convolution layers or fully
connected layers of CNN which has been trained for applications like visual
recognition are proved to be effective when used as features in other
applications such as retrieval. In this work, a deep CNN, AlexNet, is used in
the place of handcrafted features for feature extraction in the first stage of
image registration. However, there is a need to identify a suitable distance

have been evaluated in the framework of nearest neighbour and nearest neighbour
ratio matching methods using benchmark dataset. Evaluation is done by comparing

temperature of 68 {\deg}C. By combining VO2 films on a 40% transmitting DBR
structure, the average optical transmission further went down to ~ 20%. Number
of stacks of DBR plays a key role in such effective reduction of optical
transmission in IR. When the number of stacks of DBR is further increased from
4 to 7, optical transmission of metallic VO2 films on DBR nearly vanishes in
NearIR spectrum in such vanadium dioxide/1D photonic crystal based composite
photonic structures. Such temperature controlled, enhanced, broad band optical
response can be a promising design for VO2 nanoparticle based hybrid photonic
absorbers for various smart window applications.

  for Public Consumption","11 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables, presented at 3rd International
  Conference on Dosimetry and its Applications (ICDA-3), 27-31 May, 2019,
  Lisbon",,"10.1016/j.radphyschem.2020.108951",,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The primary motivation for this work is the evaluation of the radon
concentration in portable water for human consumption in Bibala, a municipality
in Angola, where granitic rocks are common, and contain a high concentration of
uranium that can be mobilized in underground water. Radon is the largest
contributor of radioactive pollution in underground water.Its concentration in
water, represents a public health risk due to the fact that the gas can easily
escape into the air, adding to the total indoor concentration of radon.On the
other hand, ingestion of water with a high radon concentration represents an
additional risk to the stomach. Measurements of radon concentration, in Bibala
municipality's water, were performed on 16 samples obtained from wells of
various depths and analyzed with DURRIDGEs' RAD7 equipment. Measured
concentrations are in the range from 39.5 to 202 Bq/L , with 2 of the recovered
samples presenting values over 100 Bq/L.

the same way as network devices transmit, process, and receive digitally
encoded data. Communication protocols have led to the rapid development of
computer networks. Therefore, we need to develop communication protocols for
biological cell networks, which will lead to significant development,
especially in medical applications where surgery or delivery of drugs can be
performed using nanoscale devices. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network that
contains a series of clusters to make a valid and secure transaction. Blockhain
technology is used in many areas such as e-commerce, public services, security,
finance, Internet stuff, etc. Although blockchain has a major impact on
Internet technology, it suffers from time problems and scalability. DNA
computing is the execution of computations using natural molecules, especially
DNA. DNA gaps above silicon because of massive parallelism, size and storage
density. In this paper, biological cells and DNA are used to create the
necessary protocols for the networks to be used in the performance of the
cell-based communication system. The proposed hybrid solution involves DNA as
well as calculated on an enzymatic basis, where each contributes to the
function of a given protocol. Also a correspondence between blockchain and DNA
is proposed that can be utilized to create DNA based blockchain.
