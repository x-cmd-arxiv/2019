transported by a constant volume-flux flow of low Reynolds number, through the
T-junction of a channel with rectangular cross-section. We use millimetric
ovalbumin-alginate capsules which we manufacture and characterise independently
of the flow experiment. Centred capsules travel at constant velocity down the
straight channel leading to the T-junction where they decelerate and expand in
the spanwise direction before turning into one of the two identical daughter
channels. There, non-inertial lift forces act to re-centre them and relax their
shape until they reach a steady state of propagation. We find that the dynamics
of fixed-size capsules within our channel geometry are governed by a capillary
number Ca defined as the ratio of viscous shear forces to elastic restoring
forces. We quantify the elastic forces by statically compressing the capsule to
50% of its initial diameter between parallel plates rather than by the Young's
modulus of the encapsulating membrane, in order to account for different
membrane thickness, pre-inflation and non-linear elastic deformation. We show
that the maximum extension in the T-junction of capsules of different stiffness
collapses onto a master curve in Ca. Thus, it provides a sensitive measure of
the relative stiffness of capsules at constant flow rate, particularly for
softer capsules. We also find that the T-junction can sort fixed-size capsules
according to their stiffness because the position in the T-junction from which
capsules are entrained into the daughter channel depends uniquely on Ca. We
demonstrate that a T-junction can be used as a sorting device by enhancing this
initial capsule separation through a diffuser.

done on either estimating the pose of the garment as a whole or detecting the

garment represents the global information for recognising the category of the
garment, whereas the detection of landmarks can facilitate subsequent grasping

Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76\mathrm{~TeV}$ is analyzed through the
estimation of an angular power spectrum. Issues with $|\eta| < 0.9$ limitation
are tackled, as well as event multiplicity and detector efficiency. Firstly,
spectra are calculated for toy Monte Carlo samples. Secondly, heavy-ion data
spectra are presented for the full momentum phase space $0.15 < p_T <
100\mathrm{~GeV}$ and also separate intervals $p_T < 0.54\mathrm{~GeV}$ and
$p_T > 0.54\mathrm{~GeV}$. The latter reveal how different geometries dominate

particles generated through the AMPT model to the same power spectrum analysis.
This comparison shows that in scales dominated by flow geometry, AMPT

distributed systems, are recently being integrated into mainstream programming
languages. In practice, a very important notion for dealing with such types is
that of subtyping, since it allows for typing larger classes of system, where a
program has not precisely the expected behaviour but a similar one.
Unfortunately, recent work has shown that subtyping for session types in an
asynchronous setting is undecidable. To cope with this negative result, the
only approaches we are aware of either restrict the syntax of session types or
limit communication (by considering forms of bounded asynchrony). Both
approaches are too restrictive in practice, hence we proceed differently by
presenting an algorithm for checking subtyping which is sound, but not complete
(in some cases it terminates without returning a decisive verdict). The
algorithm is based on a tree representation of the coinductive definition of
asynchronous subtyping; this tree could be infinite, and the algorithm checks
for the presence of finite witnesses of infinite successful subtrees.
Furthermore, we provide a tool that implements our algorithm. We use this tool
to test our algorithm on many examples that cannot be managed with the previous
approaches, and to provide an empirical evaluation of the time and space cost
of the algorithm.

principal parameters: temperature T, magnetic field B, and current density Jd .
The critical temperature Tc is one of the first parameters that is measured and
in a certain way defines the superconductor. From the practical applications
point of view, of equal importance is the upper critical magnetic field Bc2 and
conventional critical current density Jc (above which the system begins to show
resistance without entering the normal state). However, a seldom-measured
parameter, the depairing current density Jd , holds the same fundamental
importance as Tc and Bc2, in that it defines a boundary between the
superconducting and normal states. A study of Jd sheds unique light on other
important characteristics of the superconducting state such as the superfluid
density and the nature of the normal state below Tc, information that can play
a key role in better understanding newly-discovered superconducting materials.
From a measurement perspective, the extremely high values of Jd make it
difficult to measure, which is the reason why it is seldom measured. Here, we
will review the fundamentals of current-induced depairing and the fast-pulsed
current technique that facilitates its measurement and discuss the results of
its application to the topological-insulator/chalcogenide interfacial

any new input image pair, dense correspondences in the form of a dense

many applications of registration, the spatial transformation itself is only
required to propagate points or regions of interest (ROIs). In such cases,
detailed pixel- or voxel-level correspondence within or outside of these ROIs
often have little clinical value. In this paper, we propose an alternative
paradigm in which the location of corresponding image-specific ROIs, defined in
one image, within another image is learnt. This results in replacing image
registration by a conditional segmentation algorithm, which can build on
typical image segmentation networks and their widely-adopted training
strategies. Using the registration of 3D MRI and ultrasound images of the
prostate as an example to demonstrate this new approach, we report a median
target registration error (TRE) of 2.1 mm between the ground-truth ROIs defined
on intraoperative ultrasound images and those propagated from the preoperative
MR images. Significantly lower (>34%) TREs were obtained using the proposed
conditional segmentation compared with those obtained from a
previously-proposed spatial-transformation-predicting registration network
trained with the same multiple ROI labels for individual image pairs. We
conclude this work by using a quantitative bias-variance analysis to provide

is persistent as each robot's private type remains unknown to other robots for
all stages. The deception is rational as robots aim to achieve their deception
goals at minimum cost. Each robot forms a dynamic belief of others' types based
on intrinsic or extrinsic information. Perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE)
is a natural solution concept for dynamic games of incomplete information. Due
to its requirements of sequential rationality and belief consistency, PBNE
provides a reliable prediction of players' actions, beliefs, and expected
cumulative costs over the entire K stages. The contribution of this work is

most promising due to its proven accuracy and infrastructure deployment.
Several WLAN-based IPS have been proposed in the past, from which the best
results have been shown by so-called fingerprint-based systems. This paper
proposes an indoor positioning system which extends traditional WLAN
fingerprinting by using received signal strength (RSS) measurements along with
channel estimates as an effort to improve classification accuracy for scenarios
with a low number of Access Points (APs). The channel estimates aim to
characterize complex indoor environments making it a unique signature for
fingerprinting-based IPS and therefore improving pattern recognition in
radio-maps. Since commercial WLAN cards offer limited measurement information,
software-defined radio (SDR) as an emerging trend for fast prototyping and
research integration is chosen as the best cost-effective option to extract
channel estimates. Therefore, this paper first proposes an 802.11b WLAN SDR
beacon receiver capable of measuring RSS and channel estimates. The SDR is
designed using LabVIEW (LV) environment and leverages several inherent platform
acceleration features that achieve real-time capturing. The receiver achieves a
fast-rate measurement capture of 9 packets per second per AP. The
classification of the propose IPS uses a support vector machine (SVM) for

Additionally, measurement fluctuations require laborious signal processing, and

achieving a higher probability of RSS measurement collection during a given

variety of applications ranging from the theory of stochastic networks to math
finance, and under general stability conditions, it has a unique stationary
distribution. In such applications, to implement a stochastic optimization
algorithm or quantify robustness of a model, it is useful to characterize the
dependence of stationary performance measures on model parameters. In this work
we characterize parametric sensitivities of the stationary distribution of an
RBM in a simple convex polyhedral cone; that is, sensitivities to perturbations
of the parameters that define the RBM --- namely, the covariance matrix, drift
vector and directions of reflection along the boundary of the polyhedral cone.
In order to characterize these sensitivities we study the long time behavior of
the joint process consisting of an RBM along with its so-called derivative
process, which characterizes pathwise derivatives of RBMs on finite time
intervals. We show that the joint process is positive recurrent, has a unique
stationary distribution, and parametric sensitivities of the stationary
distribution of an RBM can be expressed in terms of the stationary distribution
of the joint process. This can be thought of as establishing an interchange of
the differential operator and the limit in time. The analysis of ergodicity of
the joint process is significantly more complicated than that of the RBM due to
its degeneracy and the fact that the derivative process exhibits jumps that are
modulated by the RBM. The proofs of our results rely on path properties of
coupled RBMs and contraction properties related to the geometry of the
polyhedral cone and directions of reflection along the boundary. Our results
are potentially useful for developing efficient numerical algorithms for
computing sensitivities of functionals of stationary RBMs.

orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) systems, our results hold
when entire subcarriers share a common subset of antennas. For uplink receive

sampling actively finite difference approximations to Hessians of the network.
Gathering several approximate Hessians allows reliably to approximate the
matrix subspace $\mathcal W$ spanned by symmetric tensors $a_1 \otimes a_1
,\dots,a_{m_0}\otimes a_{m_0}$ formed by weights of the first layer together
with the entangled symmetric tensors $v_1 \otimes v_1 ,\dots,v_{m_1}\otimes
v_{m_1}$, formed by suitable combinations of the weights of the first and
second layer as $v_\ell=A G_0 b_\ell/\|A G_0 b_\ell\|_2$, $\ell \in [m_1]$, for
a diagonal matrix $G_0$ depending on the activation functions of the first
layer. The identification of the 1-rank symmetric tensors within $\mathcal W$
is then performed by the solution of a robust nonlinear program. We provide
guarantees of stable recovery under a posteriori verifiable conditions. We
further address the correct attribution of approximate weights to the first or
second layer. By using a suitably adapted gradient descent iteration, it is
possible then to estimate, up to intrinsic symmetries, the shifts of the
activations functions of the first layer and compute exactly the matrix $G_0$.
Our method of identification of the weights of the network is fully
constructive, with quantifiable sample complexity, and therefore contributes to
dwindle the black-box nature of the network training phase. We corroborate our
theoretical results by extensive numerical experiments.

exploitation of knowledge in domains in which they are already expert.
  In this dissertation, I present several case studies that demonstrate how
reading and writing behaviors interact to construct personal knowledge bases.
These studies use LDA topic modeling to represent the information environment
of the texts each author read and wrote. Three studies revolve around Charles
Darwin. Darwin left detailed records of every book he read for 23 years, from
disembarking from the H.M.S. Beagle to just after publication of The Origin of
Species. Additionally, he left copies of his drafts before publication. I
characterize his reading behavior, then show how that reading behavior
interacted with the drafts and subsequent revisions of The Origin of Species,
and expand the dataset to include later readings and writings. Then, through a
study of Thomas Jefferson's correspondence, I expand the study to non-book
data. Finally, through an examination of neuroscience citation data, I move
from individual behavior to collective behavior in constructing an information
environment. Together, these studies reveal ""the interplay between individual

the most likely mode of rupture propagation, we instead treat the modes as

model simultaneously determines the number of events that best identify with

sequence with bounded path variation (i.e. sum of the distances between
successive decisions). We generate the lower bound of the worst-case
second-order dynamic regret by incorporating actual subgradient norms. We show
that this lower bound matches with our regret guarantee within a constant
factor, which makes our algorithm minimax optimal. We also derive the extension
for learning in each decision coordinate individually. We demonstrate how to

path variation of the comparator sequence grows in time or the feedback
regarding such bound arrives partially as time goes on. We further build on our

citizens' mandate to meet sustainable development goals. Repositioning
democratic values of citizens' choices in these complex ecosystems has turned
out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and
opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively
engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public
urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the
Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens
assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters.
The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving
witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence
and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the
challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus
to empower citizens' trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS
localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and
crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how
real-time collective measurements over citizens' choices can be made in a fully
decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by
deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of
transport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated
using official accident data from public authorities, which are compared
against wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus,
self-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented

three-dimensional vectors composed of pressure, salinity, and temperature,
appearing as a continuous curve in three-dimensional space. The shape of this
curve is faithfully represented by a path signature, which is a collection of
all the iterated integrals. Moreover, the product of two terms of the signature
of a path can be expressed as the sum of higher-order terms. Thanks to this
algebraic property, a nonlinear function of profile shape can always be
represented by a weighted linear combination of the iterated integrals, which
enables machine learning of a complicated function of the profile shape. In
this study, we performed supervised learning for existing Argo data with
quality control flags by using the signature method, and demonstrated the
estimation performance by cross-validation. Unlike rule-based approaches, which
require several complicated and possibly subjective rules, this method is
simple and objective in nature because it relies only on past knowledge
regarding the shape of profiles. This technique should be critical to realizing
automatic quality control for Argo profile data.

known at the start (e.g. stadiums), the traffic generation and the user
movement in TCEs is variable and influenced by the dynamics of the event. The
movement of users can lead to overloads in APs (Access Point) in case they are

that resort to the adjustable positioning of APs integrated into UAVs (Unmanned

However, in real-world scenarios, out-of-vocabulary (a.k.a. OOV) words that do

accurate representations of these words with only a few observations. In this
paper, we formulate the learning of OOV embeddings as a few-shot regression

oracle embedding vector (defined as embedding trained with abundant
observations) based on limited observations. Specifically, we propose a novel
hierarchical attention-based architecture to serve as the neural regression
function, with which the context information of a word is encoded and
aggregated from K observations. Furthermore, our approach can leverage
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for adapting the learned model to the new

significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate embeddings

family of ""rank-polymorphic"" programming languages. The principal control
mechanism of such languages is the general lifting of functions that operate on
arrays of rank (or dimension) $r$ to operate on arrays of any higher rank $r' >
r$. We present a core, functional language, Remora, that captures this
mechanism, and develop both a formal, dynamic semantics for the language, and
an accompanying static, rank-polymorphic type system for the language.
Critically, the static semantics captures the shape-based lifting mechanism of
the language. We establish the usual progress and preservation properties for
the type system, showing that it is sound, which means that ""array shape""
errors cannot occur at run time in a well-typed program. Our type system uses
dependent types, including an existential type abstraction which permits
programs to operate on arrays whose shape or rank is computed dynamically;
however, it is restricted enough to permit static type checking.
  The rank-polymorphic computational paradigm is unusual in that the types of
arguments affect the dynamic execution of the program -- they are what drive
the rank-polymorphic distribution of a function across arrays of higher rank.
To highlight this property, we additionally present a dynamic semantics for a
partially erased variant of the fully-typed language and show that a
computation performed with a fully-typed term stays in lock step with the
computation performed with its partially erased term. The residual types thus
precisely characterise the type information that is needed by the dynamic
semantics, a property useful for the (eventual) construction of efficient
compilers for rank-polymorphic languages.

sexism and sexual harassment in the workplace by discovering themes in 2,362
experiences posted on the Everyday Sexism Project's website everydaysexism.com.
Method: This study used both quantitative and qualitative methods. The
quantitative method was a computational framework to collect and analyze a
large number of workplace sexual harassment experiences. The qualitative method
was the analysis of the topics generated by a text mining method. Results:
Twenty-three topics were coded and then grouped into three overarching themes
from the sex discrimination and sexual harassment literature. The Sex
Discrimination theme included experiences in which women were treated
unfavorably due to their sex, such as being passed over for promotion, denied
opportunities, paid less than men, and ignored or talked over in meetings. The
Sex Discrimination and Gender harassment theme included stories about sex
discrimination and gender harassment, such as sexist hostility behaviors
ranging from insults and jokes invoking misogynistic stereotypes to bullying
behavior. The last theme, Unwanted Sexual Attention, contained stories
describing sexual comments and behaviors used to degrade women. Unwanted
touching was the highest weighted topic, indicating how common it was for
website users to endure being touched, hugged or kissed, groped, and grabbed.
Conclusions: This study illustrates how researchers can use automatic processes
to go beyond the limits of traditional research methods and investigate
naturally occurring large scale datasets on the internet to achieve a better
understanding of everyday workplace sexism experiences.

our approach is to create and combine image pairs within individual databases
as the training set, which effectively bypasses the issue of perceptual scale
realignment. We compute a continuous quality annotation for each pair from the
corresponding human opinions, indicating the probability of one image having
better perceptual quality. We train a deep neural network for BIQA over the
training set of massive image pairs by minimizing the fidelity loss.
Experiments on six IQA databases demonstrate that the optimized model by the

often invaluable. This paper is the first report to apply optical parametric
amplification to implement single-shot ultrafast imaging with high space and
time resolutions. Our setup breaks the constraints usually occurring among the
time resolution, frame number, frame interval and spatial resolution in
existing single-shot femtosecond imagers, so its performance can be greatly
improved by using laser pulses with higher power and shorter time durations.
Our setup has provided the highest experimental record of the frame rate and
spatial resolution with the temporal resolution of 50 fs simultaneously. It is
very powerful for accurate temporal and spatial observations of the ultrafast
transient events with a lifetime down to the femtosecond scale, such as atomic
or molecular dynamics in photonic material, plasma physics, living cells, and
neural activity.

upon on a classical teach-and-repeat framework, which is widely adopted in
infrastructure inspection, aerial transportation, and search-and-rescue. For
these applications, human's intention is essential to decide the topological
structure of the flight trajectory of the drone. However, poor teaching
trajectories and changing environments prevent a simple teach-and-repeat system
from being applied flexibly and robustly. In this paper, instead of commanding
the drone to precisely follow a teaching trajectory, we propose a method to
automatically convert a human-piloted trajectory, which can be arbitrarily
jerky, to a topologically equivalent one. The generated trajectory is
guaranteed to be smooth, safe, and kinodynamically feasible, with a human
preferable aggressiveness. Also, to avoid unmapped or dynamic obstacles during
flights, a sliding-windowed local perception and re-planning method are
introduced to our system, to generate safe local trajectories onboard. We name
our system as teach-repeat-replan. It can capture users' intention of a flight
mission, convert an arbitrarily jerky teaching path to a smooth repeating
trajectory, and generate safe local re-plans to avoid unmapped or moving
obstacles. The proposed planning system is integrated into a complete
autonomous quadrotor with global and local perception and localization
sub-modules. Our system is validated by performing aggressive flights in
challenging indoor/outdoor environments. We release all components in our
quadrotor system as open-source ros-packages.

about two of these problem types that were regarded by TAs as the least
instructionally beneficial of all problem types--the context rich and
multiple-choice formats. Many TAs listed no pros at all for these problem
types, despite being explicitly asked for at least one pro. They viewed
multiple-choice questions nearly exclusively as tools for high-stakes summative
assessment rather than their possible use as formative assessment tools, e.g.,
as clicker questions even in large classes. Similarly, TAs viewed context-rich
problems as overly challenging, unnecessarily wordy, and too time-consuming to
be instructionally beneficial to their students. While TAs' concerns have
obvious validity and value, the benefits of well-designed multiple-choice

from the wall. Similar behavior was observed occasionally for sphere P2 with

height before descending towards the wall. The sphere trajectories exhibited
multiple behaviors including saltation, resuspension and sliding motion with
small random bouncing depending on both $Re_\tau$ and specific gravity. The
lighter sphere at $Re_\tau=1300$, which remained suspended above the wall
during most of its trajectory, propagated with the fastest streamwise velocity.
By contrast, the denser sphere at $Re_\tau=700$, which mostly slid along the
wall, propagated with the slowest streamwise velocity. After the spheres
approached an approximate terminal velocity, many experienced additional
lift-off events that were hypothesized to be driven by hairpins or coherent
flow structures. Spheres were observed to rotate about all three coordinate
axes. While the mean shear may induce a rotation about the spanwise axis,
near-wall coherent structures and the sphere's wake might drive the streamwise
and wall-normal rotations. In all cases where the sphere propagates along the
wall, sliding motion, rather than forward rolling motion, is dominant.

We show that the cost of mismatch in one-to-one codes is no larger than that of

probing D-type singularities. Equivalently, this theory can be obtained from an
F-theory compactification using ""-2""-curves intersecting according to a D-type

integrating the 6d anomaly polynomial over the Riemann surface. As a second

harmful information leaks, the timing information leakage is the ability for an
attacker to deduce internal information depending on the system execution time.
We address the following problem: given a timed system, synthesize the
execution times for which one cannot deduce whether the system performed some
secret behavior. We solve this problem in the setting of timed automata (TAs).
We first provide a general solution, and then extend the problem to parametric
TAs, by synthesizing internal timings making the TA secure. We study
decidability, devise algorithms, and show that our method can also apply to
program analysis.

the average successful tracking probability (ASTP) of time-varying
millimeter-wave MIMO systems. In contrast to most existing works that employ
one transmitting-receiving (Tx-Rx) beam pair once only in each training period,
we investigate a more general framework, where the Tx-Rx beam pairs are allowed
to be used repeatedly to improve the received signal powers in specific
directions. In the case of orthogonal Tx-Rx beam pairs, a power-based estimator
is employed to track the time-varying AoA and AoD of the channel, and the
resulting training beam pair sequence design problem is formulated as an
integer nonlinear programming (I-NLP) problem. By dividing the feasible region
into a set of subregions, the formulated I-NLP is decomposed into a series of
concave sub I-NLPs, which can be solved by recursively invoking a nonlinear
branch-and-bound algorithm. To reduce the computational cost, we relax the
integer constraints of each sub I-NLP and obtain a low-complexity solution via
solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of their relaxed problems. For the
case when the Tx-Rx beam pairs are overlapped in the angular space, we estimate
the updated AoA and AoD via an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm.
Moreover, since no explicit expression for the ASTP exists for the OMP-based
estimator, we derive a closed-form lower bound of the ASTP, based on which a
favorable beam pair allocation strategy can be obtained. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed beam allocation strategy over
existing benchmarks.

torques generated by these spin currents allow for the magnetic detection of

  Vehicles on Long Trips",,,,,"cs.LO cs.ET cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are gaining popularity due to their
economic efficiency as well as their contribution to green management. PHEVs
allow the driver to use electric power exclusively for driving and then switch
to gasoline as needed. The more gasoline a vehicle uses, the higher cost is
required for the trip. However, a PHEV cannot last for a long period on stored
electricity without being recharged. Thus, it needs frequent recharging
compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. Moreover, the battery
recharging time is usually long, which leads to longer delays on a trip.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide a flexible navigation management scheme
along with an efficient recharging schedule, which allows the driver to choose
an optimal route based on the fuel-cost and time-to-destination constraints. In
this paper, we present a formal model to solve this PHEV navigation management
problem. The model is solved to provide a driver with a comprehensive routing
plan including the potential recharging and refueling points that satisfy the
given requirements, particularly the maximum fuel cost and the maximum trip
time. In addition, we propose a price-based navigation control technique to
achieve better load balance for the traffic system. Evaluation results show
that the proposed formal models can be solved efficiently even with large road
networks.

approach to train a robust model. In this paper, we propose an adversarial
process using cosine similarity, whereas conventional adversarial processes are
based on inverted categorical cross entropy (CCE). When used for training an
identification model, the adversarial process induces the competition of two
discriminative models; one for a primary task such as speaker identification or
image recognition, the other one for a subsidiary task such as channel
identification or domain identification. In particular, the adversarial process
degrades the performance of the subsidiary model by eliminating the subsidiary
information in the input which, in assumption, may degrade the performance of
the primary model. The conventional adversarial processes maximize the CCE of
the subsidiary model to degrade the performance. We have studied a framework
for training robust discriminative models by eliminating channel or domain
information (subsidiary information) by applying such an adversarial process.
However, we found through experiments that using the process of maximizing the
CCE does not guarantee the performance degradation of the subsidiary model. In
the proposed adversarial process using cosine similarity, on the contrary, the
performance of the subsidiary model can be degraded more efficiently by
searching feature space orthogonal to the subsidiary model. The experiments on
speaker identification and image recognition show that we found features that
make the outputs of the subsidiary models independent of the input, and the
performances of the primary models are improved.

social network analysis. Many recent works have relied on partially labeled
cross-graph node correspondences, i.e., anchor links. However, due to the
privacy and security issue, the manual labeling of anchor links for diverse
scenarios may be prohibitive. Aligning two graphs without any anchor links is a
crucial and challenging task. In this paper, we propose an Unsupervised
Adversarial Graph Alignment (UAGA) framework to learn a cross-graph alignment
between two embedding spaces of different graphs in a fully unsupervised
fashion (\emph{i.e.,} no existing anchor links and no users' personal profile
or attribute information is available). The proposed framework learns the
embedding spaces of each graph, and then attempts to align the two spaces via
adversarial training, followed by a refinement procedure. We further extend our
UAGA method to incremental UAGA (iUAGA) that iteratively reveals the unobserved
user links based on the pseudo anchor links. This can be used to further
improve both the embedding quality and the alignment accuracy. Moreover, the
proposed methods will benefit some real-world applications, \emph{e.g.,} link
prediction in social networks. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches UAGA and iUAGA for
unsupervised graph alignment.

out-of-the plane position, resulting in a buckled structure. Due to Ge doping,
the band-gaps open up in both. The 1.227 eV direct gap of C$_{17}$Ge is ideal
for effective light absorbance and optoelectronic devices. Further study of

Parametric Petri Nets allow for compact representation of systems, and cope

magnetized vacuum (i.e., in an external background field $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu} $)
the transverse degrees of freedom of the photons-- for such systems-- can be
described in terms of the form factors constructed out of the background field

${\tilde{\bar{F}}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}}$. These form factors transform
differently under CP transformation. While $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}$

  the other one, ${\tilde{\bar{F}}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}}$( describing
polarization along B ($|\gamma_\bot >$), is CP odd. In the interaction
Lagrangian, if the scalar is interchanged with the pseudoscalar, the role of
the two form factors just gets interchanged. Thus for nearly degenerate
strengths of the coupling constants ( $g_{\gamma\gamma\phi}$ and
$g_{\gamma\gamma _a}$ ) and masses ($m_\phi$ and $m_a$ ) of the respective

difficult in laboratory or astrophysics based experiments. The basic motivation
of this investigation is to reduce this uncertainty through incorporation of
parity violating ({\it originating through magnetized medium effects }) part of

shows an inner cavity of the similar size of the best-fit gas model, but its
out edge is at $\sim$ 200 AU, much smaller than the fitted gas disk. Such a

subjected to an arbitrary uniform eigenstrain are derived for the first time.
Correspondingly, the stress/strain concentration tensors for a spherical
nano-inhomogeneity subjected to arbitrary uniform far-field stress/strain
loadings are also derived. Using the obtained concentration tensors, the
effective bulk and shear moduli are derived by employing the dilute
approximation and the Mori-Tanaka method, respectively, which can be used for
both nano-composites and nano-porous materials. An equivalent interface
curvature parameter reflecting the influence of the interface bending
resistance is found, which can significantly simplify the complex expressions
of the effective properties. In addition to size-dependency, the closed form
expressions show that the effective bulk modulus is invariant to interface
bending resistance parameters, in contrast to the effective shear modulus. We
also put forward for the first time a characteristic interface curvature
parameter, near which the effective shear modulus is affected significantly.
Numerical results show that the effective shear moduli of nano-composites and
nano-porous materials can be greatly improved by an appropriate surface
modification. Finally, the derived effective modulus with the Steigmann-Ogden
interface model is provided in the supplemental MATLAB code, which can be
easily executed, and used as a benchmark for semi-analytical solutions and

coordinate transformations into a smaller-dimensional subsystem and an
endogenous dynamic feedback. For flat continuous-time systems, no comparable
result is available. The advantage of such a decomposition is that the complete
system is flat if and only if the subsystem is flat. Thus, by repeating the
decomposition at most $n-1$ times, where $n$ is the dimension of the state
space, the flatness of a discrete-time system can be checked in an algorithmic
way. If the system is flat, then the algorithm yields a flat output which only
depends on the state variables. Hence, every flat discrete-time system has a
flat output which does not depend on the inputs and their forward-shifts.
Again, no comparable result for flat continuous-time systems is available. The
algorithm requires in each decomposition step the construction of state- and
input transformations, which are obtained by straightening out certain vector

single-server PIR problem and LRCs. In particular, we show the following
results: (i) PIR schemes designed for retrieving a single message are
equivalent to classical LRCs; and (ii) PIR schemes for retrieving multiple
messages are equivalent to cooperative LRCs. These equivalence results allow us
to recover upper bounds on the download rate for PIR-SI schemes, and to obtain
a novel rate upper bound on cooperative LRCs. We show results for both linear
and non-linear codes.

trackers on the short-term/long-term spectrum. The benchmark contains an
extensive evaluation of the largest number of long-term tackers and comparison
to state-of-the-art short-term trackers. We analyze the influence of tracking
architecture implementations to long-term performance and explore various
re-detection strategies as well as influence of visual model update strategies

proposals and implementations thus far have mostly involved Non Volatile Memory
(NVM) devices like Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM), Phase Change Memory

systems based on RRAM, PCM or spintronic devices need in-house laboratory
facilities and cannot be done through merchant foundries, unlike conventional
silicon based CMOS chips. Floating gate transistors need large voltage pulses
for weight update, making on-chip learning in such systems energy inefficient.
This paper proposes and implements through SPICE simulations on-chip learning
in analog hardware NN using only conventional silicon based MOSFETs (without
any floating gate) as synapses since they are easy to fabricate. We first model
the synaptic characteristic of our single transistor synapse using SPICE
circuit simulator and benchmark it against experimentally obtained
current-voltage characteristics of a transistor. Next we design a Fully
Connected Neural Network (FCNN) crossbar array using such transistor synapses.
We also design analog peripheral circuits for neuron and synaptic weight update
calculation, needed for on-chip learning, again using conventional transistors.
Simulating the entire system on SPICE simulator, we obtain high training and
test accuracy on the standard Fisher's Iris dataset, widely used in machine
learning. We also compare the speed and energy performance of our transistor
based implementation of analog hardware NN with some previous implementations
of NN with NVM devices and show comparable performance with respect to on-chip
learning.

the universality class of the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model, which is a
paradigmatic model for traffic flow on highways, was not known except for the
special case $v_{\text{max}}=1$. Here the model corresponds to the TASEP
(totally asymmetric simple exclusion process) that is known to belong to the

show that the NaSch model also belongs to the KPZ class \cite{KPZ} for general

of potentially rewarding studies. However, the opaqueness of the Earth's
ionosphere makes the ULW celestial radio emission very difficult to detect with
ground-based instrumentation. The impact of the ionosphere on ULW radio
emission depends on the Solar cycle activities and varies with time. In
addition, the ULW spectrum region is densely populated by intensive artificial
radio frequency interference (RFI). An obvious solution of these problems is to
place an ULW radio telescope in space. However, this solution is expensive and
poses non-negligible technological challenges. An alternative approach is
triggered by recent studies showing that the period of post 2020 will be most
suitable for exploratory ground-based ULW radio observations due to the
expected 'calm' state of the ionosphere; the ionospheric cutoff-frequency could
be well below 10 MHz, even in the day time. In anticipation of this upcoming
opportunity, we propose and present in this paper a concept of an experimental
ULW radio array, with the intention of setting it up in Inner Mongolia, China.
This ULW facility will use the infrastructure of the currently operational

$n\geqslant1\}$ in Kontsevich's deformation quantization is a collection of
maps from tensor powers of the differential graded Lie algebra (dgLa) of
multivector fields to the dgLa of polydifferential operators on
finite-dimensional affine manifolds. Not a Lie algebra morphism by its term
$\mathcal{F}_1$ alone, the entire set $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{F}}$ is an
$L_\infty$-morphism instead. It induces a map of the Maurer-Cartan elements,
taking Poisson bi-vectors to deformations $\mu_A\mapsto\star_{A[[\hbar]]}$ of
the usual multiplication of functions into associative noncommutative
$\star$-products of power series in $\hbar$. The associativity of
$\star$-products is then realized, in terms of the Kontsevich graphs which
encode polydifferential operators, by differential consequences of the Jacobi
identity. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the work of this algebraic
mechanism for the Kontsevich $\star$-products (in particular, with harmonic
propagators). We inspect how the Kontsevich weights are correlated for the
orgraphs which occur in the associator for $\star$ and in its expansion using
Leibniz graphs with the Jacobi identity at a vertex.

IceCube measurements of the high-energy atmospheric muon spectrum indicate the
presence of prompt muon component at energies above 500 TeV. In this work, the
atmospheric conventional muon flux in the energy range 10 GeV - 10 PeV is
calculated using a set of hadronic models in combination with known
parameterizations of the cosmic ray spectrum by Zatsepin $\&$ Sokolskaya and by
Hillas $\&$ Gaisser. The calculation of the prompt muons with use of the
quark-gluon string model (QGSM) reproduces the muon data of the IceCube

component is required to describe the IceCube muon spectra in case if a charm
production model predicts the appreciably lower prompt lepton flux as compared
with QGSM. This addition, apparently originating from rare decay modes of the
short-lived unflavored mesons $\eta, \eta^\prime, \rho, \omega, \phi$, might
ensure the competing contribution to the high-energy atmospheric muon flux.

(DMI). Recent studies have explored using thin-film ferromagnets and
ferrimagnets to host Ne\'el skyrmions for spintronic applications. However, it
is unclear if ultrasmall (10 nm or less) skyrmions can ever be stabilized at
room temperature for practical use in high density parallel racetrack memories.
While thicker films can improve stability, DMI decays rapidly away from the
interface. As such, spins far away from the interface would experience
near-zero DMI, raising question on whether or not unrealistically large DMI is
needed to stabilize skyrmions, and whether skyrmions will also collapse away
from the interface. To address these questions, we have employed atomistic
stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations to investigate skyrmions in
amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo. It is revealed that a significant reduction in
DMI below that of Pt is sufficient to stabilize ultrasmall skyrmions even in
films as thick as 15 nm. Moreover, skyrmions are found to retain a uniform
columnar shape across the film thickness despite the decaying DMI. Our results
show that increasing thickness and reducing DMI in GdCo can further reduce the
size of skyrmions at room temperature, which is crucial to improve the density

heavy computational load associated with the restoration of an image with many

feature of our method is the use of a separable convolutional layer. We
undertake experiments to prove that the use of a separable network allows us to

as-deposited films are smooth whereas they become non-uniform due to annealing.
The heating and cooling cycles of the as-deposited films exhibit that the
resistivity of the films shows an irreversible phase-transition and become
stable after 3-4 successive heat-treatment operations in air. The electrical
conductivity of annealed InSe thin films shows a highly degenerate
semiconducting (metallic) behavior. The thermopower of the annealed films
indicates that InSe thin film is a highly degenerate n-type semiconductor i.e.
metallic. Thickness dependence thermopower obeys the Fuchs-Sondheimer theory.
The optical band gap of the annealed films increases as compared to the

also known, though perhaps not as well-known as the former one, that some
primitive recursive relations are not rudimentary. We present a simple and
elementary proof of this fact in the first part of the paper. In the second
part, we review some possible notions of representability of functions studied
in the literature, and give a new proof of the equivalence of the weak
representability with the (strong) representability of functions in
sufficiently strong arithmetical theories. Our results shed some new light on
the notions of rudimentary, primitive recursive, and representable functions
and relations, and clarify, hopefully, some misunderstandings and confusing
errors in the literature.

combining specifications and visual information of items have succeeded in
obtaining fine-grained representations of fashion items, although they
generally apply simple vector operations through a multimodal fusion. We
similarly build a multimodal model using images and attributes of the product
and further employ state-of-the-art multimodal deep neural networks applied in
computer vision to achieve a practical performance level. In addition, we model
the pricing procedure of an expert using iterative co-attention networks in
which the appearance and attributes of the product are carefully and
iteratively observed. Herein, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model
using a large dataset of secondhand no brand jewelry items received from a
collaborating fashion retailer, and show that the iterative co-attention
process operates effectively in the context of resale price prediction. Our
model architecture is widely applicable to other fashion items where appearance

crucial role in the understanding of the essential physics of these materials.
Here the doping dependence of the electromagnetic response in cuprate
superconductors is studied within the kinetic-energy driven superconducting
mechanism. The kernel of the response function is evaluated based on the linear
response approximation for a purely transverse vector potential, and can be
broken up into its diamagnetic and paramagnetic parts. In particular, this
paramagnetic part exactly cancels the corresponding diamagnetic part in the
normal-state, and then the Meissner effect is obtained within the entire
superconducting phase. Following this kernel of the response function, the
electromagnetic response calculation in terms of the specular reflection model
qualitatively reproduces many of the striking features observed in the
experiments. In particular, the local magnetic-field profile follows an
exponential law, while the superfluid density exhibits the nonlinear
temperature behavior at the lowest temperatures, followed by the linear
temperature dependence extending over the most of the superconducting
temperature range. Moreover, the maximal value of the superfluid density occurs
at around the critical doping $\delta_{\rm critical}\sim 0.16$, and then
decreases in both lower doped and higher doped regimes. The theory also shows
that the nonlinear temperature dependence of the superfluid density at the
lowest temperatures can be attributed to the nonlocal effects induced by the
d-wave gap nodes on the electron Fermi surface.

represent feasible traversals between them. Our approach has two stages. First,
we jointly train a latent pivotal state model and a curiosity-driven
goal-conditioned policy in a task-agnostic manner. Second, provided with the
information from the world graph, a high-level Manager quickly finds solution
to new tasks and expresses subgoals in reference to pivotal states to a
low-level Worker. The Worker can then also leverage the graph to easily
traverse to the pivotal states of interest, even across long distance, and
explore non-locally. We perform a thorough ablation study to evaluate our
approach on a suite of challenging maze tasks, demonstrating significant

Synchronous Parallel execution model. Execution is divided in equidistant
communication intervals, equivalent to the shortest synaptic delay in the
network. Neurons stepping is performed independently, with collective
communication guiding synchronization and exchange of synaptic events.
  The interpolation step size is fixed and chosen based on some prior knowledge
of the fastest possible dynamics in the system. However, simulations driven by
stiff dynamics or a wide range of time scales - such as multiscale simulations
of neural networks - struggle with fixed step interpolation methods, yielding
excessive computation of intervals of quasi-constant activity, inaccurate
interpolation of periods of high volatility solution, and being incapable of
handling unknown or distinct time constants. A common alternative is the usage
of adaptive stepping methods, however they have been deemed inefficient in
parallel executions due to computational load imbalance at the synchronization
barriers that characterize the BSP execution model.
  We introduce a distributed fully-asynchronous execution model that removes
global synchronization, allowing for longer variable timestep interpolations.
Asynchronicity is provided by active point-to-point communication notifying
neurons' time advancement to synaptic connectivities. Time stepping is driven
by scheduled neuron advancements based on synaptic delays across neurons,
yielding an ""exhaustive yet not speculative"" adaptive-step execution. Execution
benchmarks on 64 Cray XE6 compute nodes demonstrate a reduced number of
interpolation steps, higher numerical accuracy and lower time to solution,

features of items. Recently, many deep learning based solutions have been
proposed by exploiting reviews for recommendation. The attention mechanism is
mainly adopted in these works to identify words or aspects that are important
for rating prediction. However, it is still hard to understand whether a user
likes or dislikes an aspect of an item according to what viewpoint the user
holds and to what extent, without examining the review details. Here, we
consider a pair of a viewpoint held by a user and an aspect of an item as a
logic unit. Reasoning a rating behavior by discovering the informative logic
units from the reviews and resolving their corresponding sentiments could
enable a better rating prediction with explanation. To this end, in this paper,
we propose a capsule network based model for rating prediction with user
reviews, named CARP. For each user-item pair, CARP is devised to extract the
informative logic units from the reviews and infer their corresponding
sentiments. The model firstly extracts the viewpoints and aspects from the user
and item review documents respectively. Then we derive the representation of
each logic unit based on its constituent viewpoint and aspect. A sentiment
capsule architecture with a novel Routing by Bi-Agreement mechanism is proposed
to identify the informative logic unit and the sentiment based representations
in user-item level for rating prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted
over seven real-world datasets with diverse characteristics. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed CARP obtains substantial performance gain over
recently proposed state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction accuracy.
Further analysis shows that our model can successfully discover the
interpretable reasons at a finer level of granularity.

in the interpretation of colour-magnitude diagrams of young and

In this work, we evaluate the distinctive spectra and distributions in
colour-colour space that follow from the presence of a substantial range in
effective temperatures across the surface of fast rotators. The calculations
are inserted in a formalism similar to the one usually adopted for non-rotating
stars, which allows us to derive tables of bolometric corrections as a function
not only of a reference effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity,
but also of the rotational speed with respect to the break-up value, $\omega$,
and the inclination angle, $i$. We find that only very fast rotators
($\omega>0.95$) observed nearly equator-on ($i>45^\circ$) present sizable
deviations from the colour-colour relations of non-rotating stars. In light of
these results, we discuss the photometry of the $\sim$ 200-Myr-old cluster NGC
1866 and its split main sequence, which has been attributed to the simultaneous
presence of slow and fast rotators. The small dispersion of its stars in
colour-colour diagrams allow us to conclude that fast rotators in this cluster
either have rotational velocities $\omega<0.95$, or are all observed nearly
pole-on. Such geometric colour-colour effects, although small, might be
potentially detectable in the huge, high-quality photometric samples in the

we propose to automatically assess the quality of registration to an atlas in
clinical FLAIR MRI scans of the brain. The method consists of automatically
segmenting the ventricles of a given scan using a neural network, and comparing
the segmentation to the atlas' ventricles propagated to image space. We used
the proposed method to improve clinical image registration to a general atlas
by computing multiple registrations and then selecting the registration that
yielded the highest ventricle overlap. Methods were evaluated in a single-site
dataset of more than 1000 scans, as well as a multi-center dataset comprising
142 clinical scans from 12 sites. The automated ventricle segmentation reached
a Dice coefficient with manual annotations of 0.89 in the single-site dataset,
and 0.83 in the multi-center dataset. Registration via age-specific atlases
could improve ventricle overlap compared to a direct registration to the
general atlas (Dice similarity coefficient increase up to 0.15). Experiments
also showed that selecting scans with the registration quality assessment
method could improve the quality of average maps of white matter hyperintensity
burden, instead of using all scans for the computation of the white matter
hyperintensity map. In this work, we demonstrated the utility of an automated

exploits a specific property of the factorization which minimizes the

is complicated when programs enforce value-dependent information-flow security
properties (in which classification of locations can vary depending on values
in other locations) and complicated further when programs exploit
shared-variable concurrency.
  Prior work has formally defined a notion of concurrency-aware refinement for
preserving value-dependent security properties. However, that notion is
considerably more complex than standard refinement definitions typically
applied in the verification of semantics preservation by compilers. To date it
remains unclear whether it can be applied to a realistic compiler, because
there exist no general decomposition principles for separating it into smaller,
more familiar, proof obligations.

almost halve the complexity of proving secure refinement. Further, we
demonstrate its applicability to secure compilation, by proving in Isabelle/HOL
the preservation of value-dependent security by a proof-of-concept compiler
from an imperative While language to a generic RISC-style assembly language,
for programs with shared-memory concurrency mediated by locking primitives.
Finally, we execute our compiler in Isabelle on a While language model of the

buckle and form stable two-dimensional shapes when compressed by bringing the
ends together. It is also known that beyond a critical value of the pre-stress,
clamped rods transition to bent, twisted three-dimensional equilibrium shapes.
Recently, we showed that pre-stressed planar shapes when immersed in a
dissipative fluid and animated by nonconservative follower forces exhibit
stable large-amplitude flapping oscillations. Here, we use time-stepper methods
to analyze the three-dimensional instabilities and dynamics of pre-stressed
planar and non-planar filament configurations when subject to active follower
forces and dissipative fluid drag. First, we find that type of boundary
constraint determines the nature of the non-linear patterns following
instability. When the filament is clamped at one end and pinned at the other
with follower forces directed towards the clamped end, we observe only stable
planar (flapping) oscillations termed flapping result. When both ends are
clamped however, we observe a secondary instability wherein planar oscillations
are destabilized by off-planar perturbations and result in fully
three-dimensional swirling patterns characterized by two distinct time-scales.
The first time scale characterizes continuous and unidirectional swirling
rotation around the end-to-end axis. The second time scale captures the rate at
which the direction of swirling reverses or flips. The overall time over which
the direction of swirling flips is very short compared to the long times over
which the filament swirls in the same direction. Computations indicate that the
reversal of swirling oscillations resembles relaxation oscillations with each
cycle initiated by a sudden jump in torsional deformation and then followed by
a period of gradual decrease in net torsion until the next cycle of variations.

shift of an impinging optical beam driven by its polarization handedness, has
many applications including precise metrology and spin-based nanophotonic
devices. It is highly desirable to control and enhance the photonic SHE.
However, such a goal remains elusive, due to the weak spin-orbit interaction of
light, especially for systems with optical loss. Here we reveal a flexible way
to modulate the photonic SHE via exceptional points, by exploiting the
transverse shift in a parity-time (PT) symmetric system with balanced gain and
loss. The underlying physics is associated with the near-zero value and abrupt
phase jump of the reflection coefficients at exceptional points. We find that
the transverse shift is zero at exceptional points, but it is largely enhanced
in their vicinity. In addition, the transverse shift switches its sign across
the exceptional point, resulting from spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking. Due to
the sensitivity of transverse shift at exceptional points, our work also
indicates that the photonic SHE can enable a precise way to probe the location
of exceptional point in photonic systems.

consistent across independent mass estimates through three CO transitions. The
high-resolution CO(3-2) observations allow us to identify the molecular outflow

deprojected molecular mass outflow rate, kinetic energy and momentum in the
starburst of NGC253. The deprojected molecular mass outflow rate is in the
range ~14-39 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an uncertainty of 0.4dex. The large
spread arises due to different interpretations of the kinematics of the
observed gas while the errors are due to unknown geometry. The majority of this
outflow rate is contributed by distinct outflows perpendicular to the disk,
with a significant contribution by diffuse molecular gas. This results in a
mass loading factor $\eta = \dot{M}_\mathrm{out} / \dot{M}_\mathrm{SFR}$ in the
range $\eta \sim 8-20$ for gas ejected out to ~300pc. We find the kinetic
energy of the outflow to be $\sim 2.5-4.5 \times 10^{54}$ erg and ~0.8dex
typical error which is ~0.1% of the total or ~8% of the kinetic energy supplied
by the starburst. The outflow momentum is $4.8-8.7 \times 10^8$ M$_\odot$ km

Creek totally-orders all operations, but does so using two different broadcast

hand, CAB is only used to ensure linearizable execution of the strongly
consistent operations, whenever distributed consensus can be solved. The
execution of strongly consistent operations also stabilizes the execution order
of the causally related weakly consistent operations. Creek uses multiversion
concurrency control to efficiently handle operations' rollbacks and
reexecutions resulting from the mismatch between the tentative and the final

alignment pairwise infall momentum, momentum correlation function, and
density-weighted pairwise velocity dispersion. We derive theoretical
expressions for these velocity alignment statistics for the first time based on
the assumption that the density fluctuation is a Gaussian random field. Using
large-volume, high-resolution $N$-body simulations, we measure the alignment
statistics of density and velocity fields. The behaviors of IAs in the velocity
statistics are similar to those in the density statistics, except that the halo
orientations are aligned with the velocity field up to scales larger than those
with the density field, $r\gg 100~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, because of a factor of the
wave number in the linear relation between the density and velocity fields in
Fourier space, $v\propto \delta/k$. We show that the detected IAs of the
velocity field can be well predicted by the linear alignment model. We also
demonstrate that the baryon acoustic oscillation features can be detected in

that observations of IAs with the velocity field on large scales can provide
additional information on cosmological models, complementary to those with the

well it is inconsistent, mostly with respect to the maximal packing of 74{\%},
which may be unrealistic for polycrystalline films. To check the consistency of
these models we devise an EMT model with arbitrarily shaped inclusions. We pick
the EMT model with cubic inclusions and we compare its results with the results

effective conductivity is strongly affected not only by the boundary Kapitza
resistance but also by intra-grain scattering for grain sizes below 100 nm.
Generally, both intra-grain conductivity and Kapitza resistance increase with
grain size. However, the effect of Kapitza resistance increase is negligible

magnification signal will be possible on a wide redshift range with foreground
HI intensity maps up to $z \lesssim 2$, while optimal results are obtained when
$0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.3$. Finally, we perform a signal to noise analysis
that shows how these measurements can constrain the HI parameters across a wide
redshift range.

the EIT on the direction of the quantization axis and the relative orientation

We have shown that from the relative strengths of the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ EIT

relative separation between the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ EIT peaks, the strengths of
the magnetic field can be calculated. We have also demonstrated that the EIT
peak amplitudes show oscillatory behaviour depending upon the orientation of
the laser polarization relative to the magnetic field direction. Using the
positions of the maxima and minima, the direction of the magnetic field can be
calculated. To understand the experimental observation, a theoretical study has
been done numerically considering all the thirteen Zeeman sub-levels. Apart
from the numerical model, a toy model has also been considered to obtain an
analytical response of the medium considering the velocity distribution. The
dependencies of the magnetic field direction and the polarization direction of
the electric fields have been explicitly derived in the analytical model.
Further the direction of the magnetic field is calculated using the analytical
solution. This study can be helpful in order to make an EIT based atomic vector
magnetometer at room temperature.

second frequency $\omega_z$ corresponding to motion along the z-direction. In
previous work, the non-relativistic energies of this system were obtained, and
it was shown that an extra degeneracy (beyond the Landau degeneracy) occurs
when the ratio $\text{w}=\omega_c/\omega_z$ is rational. In this paper, we use
Dirac's equation to obtain compact formulas for the first and second order
relativistic corrections to this system via perturbation theory. The formulas
are expressed in terms of the two frequencies $\omega_c$ and $\omega_z$, and
two quantum numbers, $n$ and $n_z$, both of which are non-negative integers.
The first order correction is negative and lowers the original energies. We
plot the energy (zeroth plus first order) versus the ratio $\text{w}$ and there
are degeneracies at all points where lines intersect. However, the degeneracy
does not occur at the same $\text{w}$ as before. To illustrate this, we show
how the first order correction splits the energy levels for the case
$\omega_c=\omega_z$.

autoregressive deep generative models such as WaveNet and SampleRNN have been
used as speech vocoders to scale up the perceptual quality of the reconstructed
signals without increasing the coding rate. However, such models suffer from a
very slow signal generation mechanism due to their sample-by-sample modelling
approach. In this work, we introduce a new methodology for neural speech
vocoding based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). A fake speech signal
is generated from a very compressed representation of the glottal excitation
using conditional GANs as a deep generative model. This fake speech is then
refined using the LPC parameters of the original speech signal to obtain a
natural reconstruction. The reconstructed speech waveforms based on this
approach show a higher perceptual quality than the classical vocoder
counterparts according to subjective and objective evaluation scores for a
dataset of 30 male and female speakers. Moreover, the usage of GANs enables to
generate signals in one-shot compared to autoregressive generative models. This
makes GANs promising for exploration to implement high-quality neural vocoders.

the right action out of the vast set of possibilities by extracting actionable
intelligence from high-dimensional data streams. Most of the times, the
high-dimensionality of actions and data makes learning of the optimal actions
by traditional learning methods impracticable. In this work, we investigate how
to discover and leverage sparsity in actions and data to enable fast learning.
As our learning model, we consider a structured contextual multi-armed bandit
(CMAB) with high-dimensional arm (action) and context (data) sets, where the
rewards depend only on a few relevant dimensions of the joint context-arm set,
possibly in a non-linear way. We depart from the prior work by assuming a
high-dimensional, continuum set of arms, and allow relevant context dimensions
to vary for each arm. We propose a new online learning algorithm called {\em
CMAB with Relevance Learning} (CMAB-RL) and prove that its time-averaged regret
asymptotically goes to zero when the expected reward varies smoothly in
contexts and arms. CMAB-RL enjoys a substantially improved regret bound
compared to classical CMAB algorithms whose regrets depend on dimensions $d_x$
and $d_a$ of the context and arm sets. Importantly, we show that when the
learner has prior knowledge on sparsity, given in terms of upper bounds
$\overline{d}_x$ and $\overline{d}_a$ on the number of relevant dimensions,
then CMAB-RL achieves $\tilde{O}(T^{1-1/(2+2\overline{d}_x +\overline{d}_a)})$
regret. Finally, we illustrate how CMAB algorithms can be used for optimal
personalized blood glucose control in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients, and
show that CMAB-RL outperforms other contextual MAB algorithms in this task.

the wide community of practitioners, researchers and students of statistics. We
briefly discuss general issues in building descriptive regression models,
strategies for variable selection, different ways of choosing functional forms
for continuous variables, and methods for combining the selection of variables
and functions. We discuss two examples, taken from the medical literature, to
illustrate problems in the practice of modelling. Our overview revealed that
there is not yet enough evidence on which to base recommendations for the
selection of variables and functional forms in multivariable analysis. Such
evidence may come from comparisons between alternative methods. In particular,
we highlight seven important topics that require further investigation and make
suggestions for the direction of further research.

model for the L chondrite parent body is constructed considering sintering of
the initially porous material, temperature dependent heat conductivity, and an
insulating regolith layer. Such models are fitted to thermochronological data
of five meteorites for which precise data for the Hf-W and U-Pb-Pb

that there is no conflict between cooling rate data and the onion-shell model.
Two models are found to be compatible with the presently available empirical
data: One model with a radius of 115 km and a formation time of 1.89 Ma after
CAI formation, another model with 160 km radius and formation time of 1.835 Ma.
The central temperature of the smaller body remains well below the Ni,Fe-FeS
eutectic melting temperature and is consistent with the apparent non-existence
of primitive achondrites related to the L chondrites. For the bigger model
incipient melting in the central core region is predicted which opens the
possibility that primitive achondrites related to L chondrites could be found.

Kerr black hole is the mechanism of launching a baryon-free relativistic jet.
An additional uncollimated outflow, consisting of sub-relativistic neutron-rich

responsible for blue and red kilonova. We explore the formation, composition
and geometry of the secondary outflow by means of simulating accretion disks
with relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics and employing realistic nuclear

in the habitable zone were previously inferred to have extremely hot climates
in most cases. This is because ${\rm H_2O}$ high-pressure (HP) ice on the
seafloor prevents chemical weathering and, thus, removal of atmospheric CO$_2$.
Previous studies, however, ignored melting of the HP ice and horizontal
variation in heat flux from oceanic crusts. Here we examine whether high heat
fluxes near the mid-ocean ridge melts the HP ice and thereby removes
atmospheric ${\rm CO_2}$. We develop integrated climate models of an Earth-size
ocean planet with plate tectonics for different ocean masses, which include the
effects of HP ice melting, seafloor weathering, and the carbonate-silicate
geochemical carbon cycle. We find that the heat flux near the mid-ocean ridge
is high enough to melt the ice, enabling seafloor weathering. In contrast to
the previous theoretical prediction, we show that climates of terrestrial
planets with massive oceans lapse into extremely cold ones (or snowball states)
with CO$_2$-poor atmospheres. Such extremely cold climates are achieved mainly
because the HP ice melting fixes seafloor temperature at the melting
temperature, thereby keeping a high weathering flux regardless of surface
temperature. We estimate that ocean planets with oceans several tens of the
Earth's ocean mass no longer maintain temperate climates. These results suggest
that terrestrial planets with extremely cold climates exist even in the
habitable zone beyond the solar system, given the frequency of water-rich
planets predicted by planet formation theories.

success of deep-learning-based methods, handling of high-dimensional appearance

with triplet loss has been widely adopted as an effective appearance feature

it is not suitable for multi-target settings that require comparison with other

become a very timely research problem. A variety of recent works have been
proposed to generalize neural networks to graphs, either from a spectral graph
theory or a spatial perspective. The majority of these works however focus on
adapting the convolution operator to graph representation. At the same time,
the pooling operator also plays an important role in distilling multiscale and
hierarchical representations but it has been mostly overlooked so far. In this
paper, we propose a parameter-free pooling operator, called iPool, that permits
to retain the most informative features in arbitrary graphs. With the argument
that informative nodes dominantly characterize graph signals, we propose a
criterion to evaluate the amount of information of each node given its
neighbors, and theoretically demonstrate its relationship to neighborhood
conditional entropy. This new criterion determines how nodes are selected and
coarsened graphs are constructed in the pooling layer. The resulting
hierarchical structure yields an effective isomorphism-invariant representation
of networked data in arbitrary topologies. The proposed strategy is evaluated
in terms of graph classification on a collection of public graph datasets,

complex emitter-emitter interactions tunable in range and phase when the

re-scattering and regeneration effects in the hadronic phase of heavy-ion
collisions. As the $\phi$ meson has a longer lifetime compared to other
resonances, it is expected that its production will not be affected by
regeneration and re-scattering processes. Measurements in small collision
systems such as proton-proton (pp) collisions provide a necessary baseline for
heavy-ion data and help to tune pQCD inspired event generators. Given that the
$\phi$ is a bound state of strange-antistrange quark pair (s$\bar{\rm{s}}$),
measurements of its production can contribute to the study of strangeness
production. Recent results obtained by using the ALICE detector show that
although $\phi$ has zero net strangeness content, it behaves like a particle
with open strangeness in small collision systems and the experimental results
agree with thermal model predictions in large systems. The production mechanism
of $\phi$ is yet to be understood. We report on measurements with the ALICE
detector at the LHC of $\phi$ meson production in pp, p--Pb, Xe--Xe and Pb--Pb
collisions. These results are reported for minimum bias event samples and as a
function of the charged particle multiplicity or centrality. The results
include the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) distributions of $\phi$ as well
as the $\langle p_{\rm T}\rangle$ and particle yield ratios. The $\phi$
effective strangeness will be discussed in relation to descriptions of its
production mechanism, such as strangeness canonical suppression,
non-equilibrium production of strange quarks and thermal models.

Mercury and PureScript, is generally nondeterministic: there can be multiple
ways to satisfy a wanted constraint in terms of global instances and locally
given constraints. Coherence is the key property that keeps this sane; it
guarantees that, despite the nondeterminism, programs still behave predictably.
Even though elaboration-based resolution is generally assumed coherent, as far
as we know, there is no formal proof of this property in the presence of
sources of nondeterminism, like superclasses and flexible contexts.
  This paper provides a formal proof to remedy the situation. The proof is
non-trivial because the semantics elaborates resolution into a target language
where different elaborations can be distinguished by contexts that do not have
a source language counterpart. Inspired by the notion of full abstraction, we
present a two-step strategy that first elaborates nondeterministically into an
intermediate language that preserves contextual equivalence, and then
deterministically elaborates from there into the target language. We use an
approach based on logical relations to establish contextual equivalence and
thus coherence for the first step of elaboration, while the second step's
determinism straightforwardly preserves this coherence property.

Statistical analysis using conventional testing and a novel Monte Carlo method
were used to look for evidence of two culturally prevalent superstitions:
Odd/even preference and aversion to the number 13. Patients spent significantly
longer with odd choices for PEEP ($OR=0.16$, $p<2\times10^{-16}$), RR
($OR=0.31$, $p<2\times10^{-16}$) and Pinsp (OR=0.48, $p=2.9\times10^{-7}$). An
aversion to the number 13 was detected for choices of RR ($p=0.00024$) and
Pinsp ($p=3.9\times10^{-5}$). However a PEEP of 13 was more prevalent than
expected by chance ($p=0.00028$). These findings suggest superstitious
preferences in intensive care therapy do exist and practitioners should be
alert to guard against other, less obvious but perhaps more clinically

  adversarial network","Accepted in Expert Systems with Applications",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The determination of precise skin lesion boundaries in dermoscopic images
using automated methods faces many challenges, most importantly, the presence
of hair, inconspicuous lesion edges and low contrast in dermoscopic images, and
variability in the color, texture and shapes of skin lesions. Existing deep
learning-based skin lesion segmentation algorithms are expensive in terms of
computational time and memory. Consequently, running such segmentation
algorithms requires a powerful GPU and high bandwidth memory, which are not
available in dermoscopy devices. Thus, this article aims to achieve precise
skin lesion segmentation with minimum resources: a lightweight, efficient
generative adversarial network (GAN) model called SLSNet, which combines 1-D
kernel factorized networks, position and channel attention, and multiscale
aggregation mechanisms with a GAN model. The 1-D kernel factorized network
reduces the computational cost of 2D filtering. The position and channel
attention modules enhance the discriminative ability between the lesion and
non-lesion feature representations in spatial and channel dimensions,
respectively. A multiscale block is also used to aggregate the coarse-to-fine
features of input skin images and reduce the effect of the artifacts. SLSNet is
evaluated on two publicly available datasets: ISBI 2017 and the ISIC 2018.
Although SLSNet has only 2.35 million parameters, the experimental results
demonstrate that it achieves segmentation results on a par with the
state-of-the-art skin lesion segmentation methods with an accuracy of 97.61%,
and Dice and Jaccard similarity coefficients of 90.63% and 81.98%,
respectively. SLSNet can run at more than 110 frames per second (FPS) in a
single GTX1080Ti GPU, which is faster than well-known deep learning-based image
segmentation models, such as FCN. Therefore, SLSNet can be used for practical
dermoscopic applications.

heterogeneous networking, especially in historic city-centers, where using
optical fibre is less realistic. Recently, the power consumption has become an
important performance metric in telecommunication due to the associated
environmental issues. In the recent bonding model, customer sites have been
equipped with two/four copper pairs, which may be exploited for designing
grouped spatial modulation (SM) aiming for reducing the power consumption and
mitigating the stubborn crosstalk in DSL communications. Explicitly, we view
the two pair copper pairs equipped for each user as a group and propose an
energy efficient transmission scheme based on grouped SM strategy for the
upstream DSL systems, which is capable of reducing the power consumption of the
upstream transmitters by activating a single copper line of each user. More
especially, in order to compensate for the potential bit-rate reduction imposed
by reducing the number of activated lines, the proposed scheme implicitly
delivers ``virtual bits"" via activating/deactivating the lines in addition to
the classic modulation scheme. This is particularly beneficial in the DSL
context, because the cross-talk imposed by activating several lines may swamp
the desired signal. Furthermore, a pair of near-optimal soft turbo detection
schemes are proposed for exploiting the unique properties of the DSL channel in
order to eliminate the error propagation problem of SM detection routinely
encountered in wireless channels. Both the attainable energy-efficiency and the
achievable Bit Error Ratio (BER) are investigated. Our simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed group-based SM is capable of outperforming the
vectoring scheme both in terms of its energy efficiency for all the examined
loop lengths and transmit powers.

language lacks. On Linux, GCC provides several thousands of builtins that are
also supported by other mature compilers, such as Clang and ICC. Maintainers of
other tools lack guidance on whether and which builtins should be implemented
to support popular projects. To assist tool developers who want to support GCC
builtins, we analyzed builtin use in 4,913 C projects from GitHub. We found
that 37% of these projects relied on at least one builtin. Supporting an
increasing proportion of projects requires support of an exponentially
increasing number of builtins; however, implementing only 10 builtins already
covers over 30% of the projects. Since we found that many builtins in our
corpus remained unused, the effort needed to support 90% of the projects is
moderate, requiring about 110 builtins to be implemented. For each project, we
analyzed the evolution of builtin use over time and found that the majority of
projects mostly added builtins. This suggests that builtins are not a legacy
feature and must be supported in future tools. Systematic testing of builtin
support in existing tools revealed that many lacked support for builtins either
partially or completely; we also discovered incorrect implementations in
various tools, including the formally verified CompCert compiler.

posterior for BNNs which scales well to large models while maintaining a
distribution over weight-space with full support. Other scalable Bayesian deep
learning methods, like MC dropout or deep ensembles, have discrete support-they
assign zero probability to almost all of the weight-space. Unlike these
discrete support methods, Radial BNNs' full support makes them suitable for use
as a prior for sequential inference. In addition, they solve the conceptual
challenges with the a priori implausibility of weight distributions with
discrete support. The Radial BNN is motivated by avoiding a sampling problem in
'mean-field' variational inference (MFVI) caused by the so-called 'soap-bubble'
pathology of multivariate Gaussians. We show that, unlike MFVI, Radial BNNs are
robust to hyperparameters and can be efficiently applied to a challenging
real-world medical application without needing ad-hoc tweaks and intensive
tuning. In fact, in this setting Radial BNNs out-perform discrete-support
methods like MC dropout. Lastly, by using Radial BNNs as a theoretically
principled, robust alternative to MFVI we make significant strides in a
Bayesian continual learning evaluation.

CrBr3). We observe that the magnetic proximity effect arising from the
spin-dependent interlayer coupling depends sensitively on the interlayer
electronic configuration. The proximity effect results in spin polarization of
graphene orbital by up to 63.6 %, together with a miniband splitting band gap
of about 73.4 meV and 8% enhancement in magnetic moment (3.47${\mu}$B/cell) in
heterostructure. The position of the Fermi level in the Dirac cone is shown to
depend strongly on the graphene-CrBr3 interlayer separation of 3.77 Angstrom.
Consequently, we also show that a perpendicular electric field can be used to
control the miniband spin splitting and transmission spectrum. Also, the
interfacial polarization effect due to the existence of two different
constituents reinforces the conductivity via electrostatic screening in the
heterolayer. These findings point toward potential nanoscale devices where the
electric field driven magnetic proximity effect can lead to unique spin
controllability and possible engineering of spin gating.

process between probing the environment to discover new rewards and using the

usually obtained by perturbing either the agent's actions (e.g., e-greedy or
Gibbs sampling) or the agent's parameters (e.g., NoisyNet), or by modifying the
reward it receives (e.g., exploration bonus, intrinsic motivation, or
hand-shaped rewards). Here, we adopt a disruptive but simple and generic
perspective, where we explicitly disentangle exploration and exploitation.
Different losses are optimized in parallel, one of them coming from the true
objective (maximizing cumulative rewards from the environment) and others being
related to exploration. Every loss is used in turn to learn a policy that
generates transitions, all shared in a single replay buffer. Off-policy methods
are then applied to these transitions to optimize each loss. We showcase our

such a way that the `line tension' of the cut depends on the local entropy
density. In the case of noisy dynamics, this is described by a
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation coupled to a diffusing field. We investigate
the resulting dynamics and find that initial inhomogeneities of the conserved
charge give rise to features in the entanglement profile, whose width and
height both grow in time as $\propto\sqrt{t}$. In particular, for a domain wall
quench, diffusion restricts entanglement growth to be $S_\text{vN} \lesssim

in the entanglement profile are present even after the charge density has
equilibrated. Our conclusions are supported by numerical results on random

continuum--continuum contribution that depends only on the kinetic energy of
the photoelectron, the laser frequency and the charge of the remaining ion, but
not on the specific atom or the orbital from which the electron is ionized.
Here we find that although effects beyond the universal IR--photoelectron
continuum--continuum transitions are rare, they do occur in special cases such

the convergence in terms of many-body diagrams is considerably faster in length

approximately covered by tubes (a generalization of local trivialization) is
the pullback of a universal space indexed by the orbit types of tubes and
cardinality of the cover. For $G$ a Lie group, via a metric model we generalize
the corresponding uniqueness theorem by Palais (1960) and Bredon (1972) for

the result of Bul\'in, Krokhin, and Opr\v{s}al [STOC'19], who gave NP-hardness
of colouring $k$-colourable graphs with $2k-1$ colours for $k\geq 3$, and the
result of Huang [APPROX-RANDOM'13], who gave NP-hardness of colouring
$k$-colourable graphs with $2^{k^{1/3}}$ colours for sufficiently large $k$.
Thus, for $k\geq 4$, we improve from known linear/sub-exponential gaps to
exponential gaps.
  Second, we show that the topology of the box complex of H alone determines
whether H-colouring of G-colourable graphs is NP-hard for all (non-bipartite,
H-colourable) G. This formalises the topological intuition behind the result of
Krokhin and Opr\v{s}al [FOCS'19] that 3-colouring of G-colourable graphs is
NP-hard for all (3-colourable, non-bipartite) G. We use this technique to
establish NP-hardness of H-colouring of G-colourable graphs for H that include
but go beyond $K_3$, including square-free graphs and circular cliques (leaving
$K_4$ and larger cliques open).
  Underlying all of our proofs is a very general observation that adjoint
functors give reductions between promise constraint satisfaction problems.

Recently deep neural network significantly advances this field and reduces

models are based on large deep models, which are computational demanding and
challenging to deploy on devices with constrained computational resources. In
this paper, we present a simple yet effective compression approach which
jointly leverages knowledge distillation and quantization to compress larger

injection and acceleration of electron bunches, generated in a multi-component
hydrogen and helium plasma employing a spatially aligned and synchronized laser
pulse. This ''plasma photocathode'' decouples injection from wake excitation by
liberating tunnel-ionized helium electrons directly inside the plasma cavity,
where these cold electrons are then rapidly boosted to relativistic velocities.
The injection regime can be accessed via optical density down-ramp injection,
is highly tunable and paves the way to generation of electron beams with
unprecedented low transverse emittance, high current and 6D-brightness. This
experimental path opens numerous prospects for transformative plasma wakefield

of its high computational cost, RTM must make use of parallel computers.
Balancing the workload distribution of an RTM is a growing challenge in
distributed computing systems. The competition for shared resources and the
differently-sized tasks of the RTM are some of the possible sources of load
imbalance. Although many load balancing techniques exist, scaling up for large
problems and large systems remains a challenge because synchronization overhead
also scales. This paper proposes a cyclic token-based work-stealing (CTWS)
algorithm for distributed memory systems applied to RTM. The novel cyclic token
approach reduces the number of failed steals, avoids communication overhead,
and simplifies the victim selection and the termination strategy. The proposed
method is implemented as a C library using the one-sided communication feature
of the message passing interface (MPI) standard. Results obtained by applying
the proposed technique to balance the workload of a 3D RTM system present a
factor of 14.1% speedup and reductions of the load imbalance of 78.4% when

Specifically, we introduce two metrics on the state space that encode notions
of traversibility of the state space for an agent. Using these metrics a
topological covering is constructed by way of a set of landmark states in a
fully self-supervised manner. We show that these landmark coverings confer
theoretical advantages for transfer learning within the goal-based multi-task
RL setting. Specifically, we demonstrate three mechanisms by which landmark
coverings can be used for successful transfer learning. First, we extend the
Landmark Options Via Reflection (LOVR) framework to this new topological
covering; second, we use the landmark-centric value functions themselves as
features and define a greedy zombie policy that achieves near oracle
performance on a sequence of zero-shot transfer tasks; finally, motivated by
the second transfer mechanism, we introduce a learned reward function that
provides a more dense reward signal for goal-based RL. Our novel topological
landmark covering confers beneficial theoretical results, bounding the Q values

investigated in a soft system (Lennard-Jones argon) and a stiff system (Tersoff
silicon) using two-dimensional lattice dynamics calculations and the Boltzmann
transport equation. This approach uses a unit cell that spans the film
thickness, which removes approximations related to the finite cross-plane
dimension required in typical three-dimensional-based approaches. Molecular
dynamics simulations are performed to obtain finite-temperature structures for
the lattice dynamics calculations and to predict thermal conductivity
benchmarks. Thermal conductivity decreases with decreasing film thickness until
the thickness reaches four unit cells (2.1 nm) for argon and three unit cells
(1.6 nm) for silicon. With a further decrease in film thickness, thermal
conductivity plateaus in argon while it increases in silicon. This unexpected
behavior, which we identify as a signature of phonon confinement, is a result
of an increased contribution from low-frequency phonons, whose density of
states increases as the film thickness decreases. Phonon mode-level analysis
suggests that confinement effects emerge below thicknesses of ten unit cells
(5.3 nm) for argon and six unit cells (3.2 nm) for silicon. Thermal
conductivity predictions based on the bulk phonon properties combined with a
boundary scattering model do not capture the low thickness behavior. To match
the two-dimensional lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics predictions for
larger thicknesses, the three-dimensional lattice dynamics calculations require
a finite specularity parameter that in some cases approaches unity. These
findings point to the challenges associated with interpreting experimental
thermal conductivity measurements of ultrathin silicon films, where surface

synthesizer control. We formalize it as finding an organized latent audio space
that represents the capabilities of a synthesizer, while constructing an
invertible mapping to the space of its parameters. By using this formulation,
we show that we can address simultaneously automatic parameter inference,
macro-control learning and audio-based preset exploration within a single

perform the invertible mapping between separate latent spaces, while steering
the organization of some latent dimensions to match target variation factors by
splitting the objective as partial density evaluation. We evaluate our proposal
against a large set of baseline models and show its superiority in both
parameter inference and audio reconstruction. We also show that the model
disentangles the major factors of audio variations as latent dimensions, that
can be directly used as macro-parameters. We also show that our model is able

challenging for ASR systems, particularly when numeric sequences are not seen
during training. This out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue is addressed in
conventional ASR systems by training part of the model on spoken domain
utterances (e.g. I need one dollar and twenty five cents.), for which numeric
sequences are composed of in-vocabulary numbers, and then using an FST
verbalizer to denormalize the result. Unfortunately, conventional ASR models
are not suitable for the low memory setting of on-device speech recognition.
E2E models such as RNN-T are attractive for on-device ASR, as they fold the AM,
PM and LM of a conventional model into one neural network. However, in the
on-device setting the large memory footprint of an FST denormer makes spoken
domain training more difficult. In this paper, we investigate techniques to
improve E2E model performance on numeric data. We find that using a
text-to-speech system to generate additional numeric training data, as well as
using a small-footprint neural network to perform spoken-to-written domain
denorming, yields improvement in several numeric classes. In the case of the
longest numeric sequences, we see reduction of WER by up to a factor of 8.

identical code fragments in binary programs. It is indispensable in fields of
software engineering and security, which has many important applications (e.g.,
plagiarism detection, bug detection). With the widespread of smart and IoT
(Internet of Things) devices, an increasing number of programs are ported to
multiple architectures (e.g. ARM, MIPS). It becomes necessary to detect similar
binary code across architectures as well. The main challenge of this topic lies
in the semantics-equivalent code transformation resulting from different
compilation settings, code obfuscation, and varied instruction set
architectures. Another challenge is the trade-off between comparison accuracy
and coverage. Unfortunately, existing methods still heavily rely on
semantics-less code features which are susceptible to the code transformation.
Additionally, they perform the comparison merely either in a static or in a
dynamic manner, which cannot achieve high accuracy and coverage simultaneously.
In this paper, we propose a semantics-based hybrid method to compare binary
function similarity. We execute the reference function with test cases, then
emulate the execution of every target function with the runtime information
migrated from the reference function. Semantic signatures are extracted during
the execution as well as the emulation. Lastly, similarity scores are
calculated from the signatures to measure the likeness of functions. We have
implemented the method in a prototype system designated as BinMatch and
evaluate it with nine real-word projects compiled with different compilation
settings, on variant architectures, and with commonly-used obfuscation methods,
totally performing over 100 million pairs of function comparison.

that is active, autonomous, and adaptive, named as the \texttt{`3A'} defense
paradigm. This chapter introduces three defense schemes that actively interact
with attackers to increase the attack cost and gather threat information, i.e.,
defensive deception for detection and counter-deception, feedback-driven Moving
Target Defense (MTD), and adaptive honeypot engagement. Due to the cyber
deception, external noise, and the absent knowledge of the other players'
behaviors and goals, these schemes possess three progressive levels of
information restrictions, i.e., from the parameter uncertainty, the payoff
uncertainty, to the environmental uncertainty. To estimate the unknown and
reduce uncertainty, we adopt three different strategic learning schemes that
fit the associated information restrictions. All three learning schemes share
the same feedback structure of sensation, estimation, and actions so that the
most rewarding policies get reinforced and converge to the optimal ones in
autonomous and adaptive fashions. This work aims to shed lights on proactive
defense strategies, lay a solid foundation for strategic learning under
incomplete information, and quantify the tradeoff between the security and

for the lattice Boltzmann method in simulating heat and mass transfer problems.
In previous works based on the halfway anti-bounce-back (ABB) boundary
condition for convection-diffusion equations (CDEs), it is reported that the
discrete effect cannot be commonly removed in the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK)
model except for a special value of relaxation time. Targeting this point in
the present paper, we still proceed within the framework of BGK model for
two-dimensional CDEs, and analyze the discrete effect on a non-halfway ABB
boundary condition which incorporates the effect of the distance ratio. By
analyzing an unidirectional diffusion problem with a parabolic distribution,
the theoretical derivations with three different discrete velocity models show
that the numerical slip is a combined function of the relaxation time and the
distance ratio. Different from previous works, we definitely find that the
relaxation time can be freely adjusted by the distance ratio in a proper range
to eliminate the numerical slip. Some numerical simulations are carried out to
validate the theoretical derivations, and the numerical results for the cases
of straight and curved boundaries confirm our theoretical analysis. Finally, it
should be noted that the present analysis can be extended from the BGK model to
other lattice Boltzmann (LB) collision models for CDEs, which can broaden the
parameter range of the relaxation time to approach 0.5.

is further shown that when $\omega<2|\Delta|$, $\sigma_{1s}(\omega)$ from the

to the vanishing $\sigma_{1s}(\omega)$ in the anomalous-skin-effect region as
the Mattis-Bardeen theory revealed. In the second-order regime, responses of
the Higgs mode during and after the optical pulse are studied. During the
pulse, we show that the scattering causes a phase shift in the second-order
response of the Higgs mode. Particularly, this phase shift exhibits a
significant $\pi$-jump at $\omega=|\Delta|$, which provides a very clear
feature for the experimental detection. After the pulse, by studying the
damping of the Higgs-mode excitation, we reveal a relaxation mechanism from the

generating patent claims. GPT-2 has demonstrated impressive efficacy of
pre-trained language models on various tasks, particularly coherent text
generation. Patent claim language itself has rarely been explored in the past
and poses a unique challenge. We are motivated to generate coherent patent
claims automatically so that augmented inventing might be viable someday. In
our implementation, we identified a unique language structure in patent claims
and leveraged its implicit human annotations. We investigated the fine-tuning
process by probing the first 100 steps and observing the generated text at each
step. Based on both conditional and unconditional random sampling, we analyze
the overall quality of generated patent claims. Our contributions include: (1)
being the first to generate patent claims by machines and being the first to
apply GPT-2 to patent claim generation, (2) providing various experiment
results for qualitative analysis and future research, (3) proposing a new
sampling approach for text generation, and (4) building an e-mail bot for
future researchers to explore the fine-tuned GPT-2 model further.

short-term and long-term time scales with and without structural break in the
stock data. Structural break point has been identified by applying Zivot and
Andrews structural trend break model to break the original time series (TSO)
into time series before structural break (TSB) and time series after structural
break (TSA). The empirical mode decomposition based Hurst exponent and variance
techniques have been applied to the TSO, TSB and TSA to identify the time
scales in short-term and long-term from the decomposed intrinsic mode
functions. We found that for TSO, TSB and TSA the short-term time scales and
long-term time scales are within the range of few days to 3 months and greater
than 5 months respectively, which indicates that the short-term and long-term
time scales are present in the stock market. The Hurst exponent is $\sim 0.5$
and $\geq 0.75$ for TSO, TSB and TSA in short-term and long-term respectively,
which indicates that the market is random in short-term and strongly correlated
in long-term. The identification of time scales at short-term and long-term
investment horizon will be useful for investors to design investment and
trading strategies.

  Using Deep Learning","under review",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The classification of amino acids and their sequence analysis plays a vital
role in life sciences and is a challenging task. This article uses and compares
state-of-the-art deep learning models like convolution neural networks (CNN),
long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRU) to solve
macromolecule classification problems using amino acids. These models have
efficient frameworks for solving a broad spectrum of complex learning problems
compared to traditional machine learning techniques. We use word embedding to
represent the amino acid sequences as vectors. The CNN extracts features from
amino acid sequences, which are treated as vectors, then fed to the models
mentioned above to train a robust classifier. Our results show that word2vec as
embedding combined with VGG-16 performs better than LSTM and GRU. The proposed
approach gets an error rate of 1.5%.

the proton lifetime being $\gtrsim 10^{34}$ years which is more than the age of
the universe. One of the important quantity that appears in the study of the
proton decay is the proton decay matrix element which is a non-perturbative
quantity in QCD which cannot be calculated by using the perturbative QCD (pQCD)
method but it can be calculated by using the lattice QCD method. In this paper
we formulate the lattice QCD method to study the proton decay matrix element.
We derive the non-perturbative formula of the proton decay matrix element from
the first principle in QCD which can be calculated by using the lattice QCD
method.

$\overline{Ric}$ and noncommutative parameter $\theta$. The physical relevance

  Uncertian Inverse Method for Sheet Metal Forming Problem",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, an image-assisted Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
parameter inverse method is proposed to identify the design parameters. In the
proposed method, the images are mapped to a low-dimensional latent space by
Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and the information loss is minimized by
network training. Therefore, an effective trade-off between information loss
and computational cost can be achieved by using the latent variables of VAE as
summary statistics of ABC, which overcomes the difficulty of selecting summary
statistics in the ABC. Besides, for some practical engineering problems,
processing the images as objective function can effective show the response
result. Meanwhile, the relationship between design parameters and the latent
variables is constructed by Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR)
surrogate model. With the well-constructed LSSVR model, the simulation
coefficient vectors under given parameters will be determined effectively.
Then, the parameters to be identified are determined by comparing the simulated
and observed coefficient vectors in ABC. Finally, a sheet forming problem is
investgated by the suggested method. The material parameters of the blank and
the process parameters of the forming process are identified. Results show that
the method is feasibility and effective for the identification of sheet forming
parameters.

simultaneous and time-spaced measurements of the observables that drive their
dynamics, i.e., through sets of time series. Typically, this is done via
hypothesis testing: the statistical properties of the empirical time series are
tested against those expected under a suitable null hypothesis. This is a very
challenging task in complex interacting systems, where statistical stability is
often poor due to lack of stationarity and ergodicity. Here, we describe an
unsupervised, data-driven framework to perform hypothesis testing in such
situations. This consists of a statistical mechanical approach - analogous to
the configuration model for networked systems - for ensembles of time series
designed to preserve, on average, some of the statistical properties observed
on an empirical set of time series. We showcase its possible applications with
a case study on financial portfolio selection.
