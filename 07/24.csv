give rise to variations in macroscopic properties such as visual appearance and
elastic modulus that show promise as signatures for early cancer detection.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to measure significant differences
in stiffness between cancerous and healthy cells owing to its high force
sensitivity and spatial resolution, however due to absorption and scattering of
light, it is often challenging to accurately locate where AFM measurements have
been made on a bulk tissue sample. In this paper we describe an image
registration method that localizes AFM elastic stiffness measurements with
high-resolution images of haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E)-stained tissue to
within 1.5 microns. Color RGB images are segmented into three structure types
(lumen, cells and stroma) by a neural network classifier trained on
ground-truth pixel data obtained through k-means clustering in HSV color space.
Using the localized stiffness maps and corresponding structural information, a
whole-sample stiffness map is generated with a region matching and
interpolation algorithm that associates similar structures with measured
stiffness values. We present results showing significant differences in
stiffness between healthy and cancerous liver tissue and discuss potential
applications of this technique.

However, exponential decays of the positional probability density function
$P(X,t)$ of packets of spreading random walkers, were observed in numerous
situations that include glasses, live cells and bacteria suspensions. We show
that such exponential behavior is generally valid in a large class of problems
of transport in random media. By extending the Large Deviations approach for a
continuous time random walk we uncover a general universal behavior for the
decay of the density. It is found that fluctuations in the number of steps of
the random walker, performed at finite time, lead to exponential decay (with
logarithmic corrections) of $P(X,t)$. This universal behavior holds also for
short times, a fact that makes experimental observations readily achievable.

variety of domains. The ability to automatically assess subject movement in
videos that were captured by affordable devices, such as Kinect cameras, is
essential for monitoring clinical rehabilitation processes, for improving motor
skills and for movement learning tasks. The need to pay attention to low-level
details while accurately tracking the movement stages, makes this task very
challenging. In this work, we introduce A-MAL, an automatic, strong movement
assessment learning algorithm that only learns from properly-performed movement
videos without further annotations, powered by a deviation time-segmentation
algorithm, a parameter relevance detection algorithm, a novel time-warping
algorithm that is based on automatic detection of common temporal
points-of-interest and a textual-feedback generation mechanism. We demonstrate
our method on movements from the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) test, which is
typically held by occupational therapists in order to monitor patients'
recovery processes after strokes.

graphene systems is intensely debated. While many works seek for explanations
in the few flat bands near the Fermi level, theory and a number of experiments
suggest that nontwisted bilayer graphene systems do exhibit - or are at least
close to - an ordered, insulating ground state related to antiferromagnetic
ordering. Here we investigate in which ways this magnetic ordering scenario is
affected by the slight twisting between the layers. We find that at charge
neutrality the ordering tendencies of twisted systems interpolate between those
of untwisted AA and AB stacked bilayers at intermediate temperatures, while at
lower temperatures of the order of typical flat-band dispersion energies, the
ordering tendencies are even enhanced for the twisted systems. The preferred
order at charge neutrality still exhibits an antiferromagnetic spin
arrangement, with ordered moments alternating on the carbon-carbon bonds, with
an enveloping variation on the moir\'e scale. This ordering can be understood
as inherited from the untwisted systems. However, even in the RPA analysis, the
possible low-energy behaviors are quite versatile, and slight doping of one or
more electrons per moir\'e cell can take the system into a, potentially
flat-band induced, ferromagnetic phase.

  Vision (ICCV 2019)",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work addresses the task of open world semantic segmentation using RGBD
sensing to discover new semantic classes over time. Although there are many
types of objects in the real-word, current semantic segmentation methods make a
closed world assumption and are trained only to segment a limited number of
object classes. Towards a more open world approach, we propose a novel method
that incrementally learns new classes for image segmentation. The proposed
system first segments each RGBD frame using both color and geometric
information, and then aggregates that information to build a single segmented
dense 3D map of the environment. The segmented 3D map representation is a key
component of our approach as it is used to discover new object classes by
identifying coherent regions in the 3D map that have no semantic label. The use
of coherent region in the 3D map as a primitive element, rather than
traditional elements such as surfels or voxels, also significantly reduces the
computational complexity and memory use of our method. It thus leads to
semi-real-time performance at {10.7}Hz when incrementally updating the dense 3D
map at every frame. Through experiments on the NYUDv2 dataset, we demonstrate
that the proposed method is able to correctly cluster objects of both known and
unseen classes. We also show the quantitative comparison with the
state-of-the-art supervised methods, the processing time of each step, and the
influences of each component.

reorganization of the brain, especially in the perilesional tissue. At
macroscales, the reestablishment of segregation within the affected hemisphere
and interhemispheric integration has been extensively documented in the
reconfiguration of brain networks. However, the local connection mechanisms
generating such global network changes are still largely unknown as well as
their potential to better predict the outcome of patients. To address this
question, time must be considered as a formal variable of the problem and not
just a simple repeated observation. Here, we hypothesize that the temporal
formation of basic connection blocks such as intermodule edges and intramodule
triangles would be sufficient to determine the large-scale brain reorganization
after stroke. To test our hypothesis, we adopted a statistical approach based
on temporal exponential random graph models (tERGMs). First, we validated the
overall performance on synthetic time-varying networks simulating the
reconfiguration process after stroke. Then, using longitudinal functional
connectivity measurements of resting-state brain activity, we showed that both
the formation of triangles within the affected hemisphere and interhemispheric
links are sufficient to reproduce the longitudinal brain network changes from 2
weeks to 1 year after the stroke. Finally, we showed that these temporal
connection mechanisms are over-expressed in the subacute phase as compared to
healthy controls and predicted the chronic language and visual outcome
respectively in patients with subcortical and cortical lesions, whereas static
approaches failed to do so. Our results indicate the importance of considering
time-varying connection properties when modeling dynamic complex systems and
provide fresh insights into the network mechanisms of stroke recovery.

meta-analysis of the evidence for the effect of short-term exposure to the

searched for relevant studies published up to March 2018. Risk of bias was
evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool 1.0 and the Risk of Bias
in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool where appropriate.
The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of evidence overall. A
random-effects meta-analysis was performed. 20 potential moderators of the
effect size were coded and the machine learning-based MetaForest algorithm was
used to identify relevant moderators. These were then entered into a
meta-regression. 33 studies met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes ranged
from -2.30 to 0.84, with a pooled effect size of $\gamma$ = -0.30 95% CI [-0.50
to -0.10]. However, there was significant residual heterogeneity between
studies and risk of bias was high. Type of natural environment, type of built
environment, gender mix of the sample, and region of study origin, among
others, were identified as relevant moderators but were not significant when
entered in a meta-regression. Quality of evidence was rated very low to low. An
assessment of publication bias was inconclusive. A small effect was found for
reduction in depressive mood following exposure to the natural environment.
However, the high risk of bias and low quality of studies limits confidence in
the results. The variation in effect size also remains largely unexplained. It
is recommended that future studies make use of reporting guidelines and aim to
reduce the potential for bias where possible.

energy curves reveal that non-local dispersion interaction between the molecule
and metallic surface predominantly controls the bonding mechanism and thus,
modifies the copper's work function. Our results imply that semi-local
functionals without any kind of van der Waals (vdW) correction can often
misinterpret this as physisorption, while, a fortuitous error cancellation can
give a right description of this adsorption picture for a wrong reason as in
the case of SCAN. The calculated density of states of the adsorbed molecule
shows that the long-range vdW correction of SCAN+rVV10 causes more than enough
hybridization between the \textit{p} orbitals of S atom and the copper
\textit{d}-bands and therefore overestimates the adsorption energies by an
average of 16\%.

resolved on approximately $6.9\times10^{10}$ grid points, and 15 fluid
variables in three spatial dimensions are used, for a total of about $10^{12}$
input quantities in three dimensions. The objective is to understand which of
the input variables contains the most relevant information about the local
turbulence regimes in stably stratified turbulence (SST). This is accomplished
by observing flow features that appear in one input variable but then `bleed
over' to multiple output variables. The bleed over is shown to be robust with
respect to the number of layers in the autoencoder. In this proof of concept,
the errors in the reconstruction include information about the spatial
variation of vertical velocity in most of the components of the reconstructed
rate-of-strain tensor and density gradient, which suggests that vertical
velocity is an important marker for turbulence features of interest in SST.
This result is consistent with what fluid dynamicists already understand about
SST and, therefore, suggests an approach to understanding turbulence based on
more detailed analyses of the reconstruction on errors in an autoencoding

the claim that one of the non-equilibrium transport coefficients, the
odd-viscosity, requires time reversal symmetry breaking in the case of systems
without internal spin. However, the Green-Kubo relations for systems with
internal spin also show that there is a possibility for non-vanishing odd

addition, we observe a new feature: dynamic correlations at significantly
higher energy, with a characteristic scale of about 160 meV. A similar scale
was previously identified in other experiments as a high-energy pseudogap. The
existence of three distinct features in the charge response is highly unusual

lack interactive three-dimensional chemistry and do not resolve the mesosphere

synchronously-rotating planets orbiting at the inner edge of habitable zones of
K- and M-dwarf stars (between $T_{\rm eff} =$ 2600 K and 4000 K). While our IHZ
climate predictions are in good agreement with GCM studies, we find noteworthy
departures in simulated ozone and HO$_{\rm x}$ photochemistry. For instance,
climates around inactive stars do not typically enter the classical moist
greenhouse regime even with high ($< 10^{-3}$ mol mol$^{-1}$) stratospheric
water vapor mixing ratios, which suggests that planets around inactive M-stars
may only experience minor water-loss over geologically significant timescales.
In addition, we find much thinner ozone layers on potentially habitable moist
greenhouse atmospheres, as ozone experiences rapid destruction via reaction
with hydrogen oxide radicals. Using our CCM results as inputs, our simulated
transmission spectra show that both water vapor and ozone features on moist
greenhouse atmospheres could be detectable by instruments NIRSpec and MIRI LRS

covariance identities are presented. In turn, these characterizations lead to
integro-differential equations which are solved with the help of both semigroup
and Fourier methodologies. Then, Poincar\'e-type inequalities for
self-decomposable laws having finite first moment are revisited. In this
non-local setting, several algebraic quantities (such as the carr\'e du champs
and its iterates) originating in the theory of Markov diffusion operators are
computed. Finally, rigidity and stability results for the Poincar\'e-ratio
functional of the rotationally invariant $\alpha$-stable laws, $\alpha\in

derived by incorporating both phase and amplitude corrections differ from the

at z~0.84 for galaxies more massive than 10^10 Msun, with elliptical galaxies
being dominant at high-density regions and disks more common in low-density

Q sub-populations, there are no statistically significant differences between

regions. The recent Gaia DR2 catalogue complemented with the deep, ground based
COSMIC DANCe catalogue offers a new database of unprecedented accuracy to
revisit the membership of clusters and star forming regions. The 30 Myr open
cluster IC 4665 is one of the few well-known clusters of this age and it is an
excellent target where to test evolutionary models and study planetary
formation.
  Aims. We aim to provide a comprehensive membership analysis of IC 4665 and to
study the following properties: empirical isochrones, distance, magnitude
distribution, present-day system mass function, and spatial distribution.
  Methods. We use the Gaia DR2 catalogue together with the DANCe catalogue to
look for members using a probabilistic model of the distribution of the
observable quantities in both the cluster and background populations.
  Results. We obtain a final list of 819 candidate members which cover a 12.4
magnitude range (7 < J < 19.4). We find that 50% are new candidates, and we
estimate a conservative contamination rate of 20%. This unique sample of
members allows us to obtain a present-day system mass function in the range of
0.02-6 Msun, which reveals a number of details not seen in previous studies. In
addition, they favour a spherically symmetric spatial distribution for this
young open cluster.
  Conclusions. Our membership analysis represents a significant increase in the
quantity and quality (low-contamination) with respect to previous studies. As
such, it offers an excellent opportunity to revisit other fundamental
parameters such as the age.

timescales for the CEE mass-loss. In order to probe the CEE-timescales we study
wide companions to post-CE binaries. Faster mass-loss timescales give rise to
higher disruption rates of wide binaries and result in larger average
separations. We make use of data from Gaia DR2 to search for ultra-wide
companions (projected separations $10^3$-$2\times 10^5$ a.u. and $M_2 > 0.4$
M$_\odot$) to several types of post-CEE systems, including sdBs, white-dwarf

ultra-wide pairs to main sequence stars and sdBs differs significantly and is
compatible with prompt mass loss (upper limit on common envelope ejection

cataclysmic variables and post-CEE binaries provide weaker constraints.
Nevertheless, the survival rate of ultra-wide pairs to the cataclysmic

radiatively-efficient active galactic nuclei (AGN) lacks a clear theoretical
explanation despite being used for many applications. Such a correlation, with
its small intrinsic scatter and its slope that is smaller than unity in log
space, represents the compelling evidence that a mechanism regulating the
energetic interaction between the accretion disk and the X-ray corona must be
in place. This ensures that going from fainter to brighter sources the coronal
emission increases less than the disk emission. We discuss here a
self-consistently coupled disk-corona model that can identify this regulating
mechanism in terms of modified viscosity prescriptions in the accretion disk.
The model predicts a lower fraction of accretion power dissipated in the corona
for higher accretion states. We then present a quantitative observational test
of the model using a reference sample of broad-line AGN and modeling the
disk-corona emission for each source in the $L_X-L_{UV}$ plane. We used the
slope, normalization, and scatter of the observed relation to constrain the
parameters of the theoretical model. For non-spinning black holes and static
coronae, we find that the accretion prescriptions that match the observed slope
of the $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation produce X-rays that are too weak with respect to
the normalization of the observed relation. Instead, considering
moderately-outflowing Comptonizing coronae and/or a more realistic
high-spinning black hole population significantly relax the tension between the
strength of the observed and modeled X-ray emission, while also predicting very
low intrinsic scatter in the $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation. In particular, this latter
scenario traces a known selection effect of flux-limited samples that
preferentially select high-spinning, hence brighter, sources.

""slingshot"" the inflaton field from regions of parameter space that do not

Square Deconvolution technique. Then, we computed the stellar RVs with a method
optimized for fast rotators, by fitting the mean stellar line profile with a
purely rotational profile instead of using a Gaussian function. The new spectra
and analysis led us to update the orbital and physical parameters of the
system, improving in particular the value of the planetary mass to $M_{\rm
p}=2.88\pm0.35\,M_{\rm Jup}$. We discovered an anomalous in-transit RV
deviation from the theoretical Rossiter-McLaughlin effect solution, calculated
from the projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda=-85.78\pm0.46$ degrees measured
with Doppler tomography. We prove that this deviation is caused by the
planetary atmosphere of KELT-9b, thus we name this effect Atmospheric
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. By analysing the magnitude of the RV anomaly, we
obtained information on the extension of the planetary atmosphere as weighted
by the model used to retrieve the stellar mean line profiles, which is up to
$1.22\pm0.02\,R_{\rm p}$. The Atmospheric Rossiter-McLaughlin effect will be
observable for other exoplanets whose atmosphere has non-negligible correlation

and 84 UDGs in 2 intermediate-redshift (z~ 0.308 - 0.348) clusters, we take
advantage of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach and assume a ubiquitous
triaxial model to investigate the intrinsic morphologies of UDGs. In contrast
to the conclusion of Burkert (2017), i.e., the underlying shapes of UDGs are
purely prolate ($C=B<A$), we find that the data favor the oblate-triaxial
models ($C<B\lesssim A$) over the nearly prolate ones. We also find that the
intrinsic morphologies of UDGs are relevant to their stellar
masses/luminosities, environments, and redshifts. First, for the low-redshift
UDGs in the same environment, the more-luminous ones are always thicker than
the less-luminous counterparts, possibly due to the more voilent internal
supernovae feedback or external tidal interactions for the progenitors of the
more-luminous UDGs. The UDG thickness dependence on luminosity is distinct from
that of the typical quiescent dwarf ellipticals (dEs) and dwarf spheroidals
(dSphs) in the local clusters and groups, but resembles that of massive
galaxies; in this sense, UDGs may not be simply treated as an extension of the
dE/dSph class with similar evolutionary histories. Second, for the low-redshift
UDGs within the same luminosity range, the ones with smaller cluster-centric
distances are more puffed-up, probably attributed to tidal interactions.
Finally, the intermediate-redshift cluster UDGs are more flattened, which
plausibly suggests a `disky' origin for high-redshift, initial UDGs.

finite precision and described by rational numbers. Based on this, we deduce
that quantum control problems both for open and closed systems are in general
not algorithmically solvable, i.e., there is no algorithm that can decide
whether dynamics of an arbitrary quantum system can be manipulated by
accessible external interactions (coherent or dissipative) such that a chosen
target reaches a desired value. This conclusion holds even for the relaxed
requirement of the target only approximately attaining the desired value. These
findings do not preclude an algorithmic solvability for a particular class of
quantum control problems. Moreover, any quantum control problem can be made
algorithmically solvable if the set of accessible interactions (i.e., controls)
is rich enough. To arrive at these results, we develop a technique based on
establishing the equivalence between quantum control problems and Diophantine
equations, which are polynomial equations with integer coefficients and integer
unknowns. In addition to proving uncomputability, this technique allows to
construct quantum control problems belonging to different complexity classes.
In particular, an example of the control problem involving a two-mode coherent
field is shown to be NP-hard, contradicting a widely held believe that two-body
problems are easy.

order to address the recovery of fixed investment costs in transmission network
planning, particularly against rising demand elasticity. At the moment, ex-post
network tariffs are utilized in addition to congestion revenues to fully
recover network costs, which often leads to over/under fixed cost recovery,
thus increasing the investment risk. Furthermore, in the case of agents with
elastic market curves, ex-post tariffs can cause several inefficiencies, such
as mistrustful bidding to exploit ex-post schemes, imperfect information in
applied costs and cleared quantities, and negative surplus for marginal
generators and consumers. These problems are exacerbated by the increasing
price-elasticity of demand, caused for example by the diffusion of demand
response technologies. To address these issues, we design a dynamic ex-ante
tariff scheme that explicitly accounts for the effect of tariffs in the
longterm network planning problem and in the underlying market clearing
process. Using linearization techniques and a novel reformulation of the
congestion rent, the long-term network planning problem is reformulated as a
single mixed-integer linear problem which returns the combined optimal values
of network expansion and associated tariffs, while accounting for price-elastic
agents and lumpy investments. The advantages of the proposed approach in terms
of cost recovery, market equilibrium and increased social welfare are discussed
qualitatively and are validated in numerical case studies.

and thermal emission models that approximate a kilonova to assess the excess'
origins. While some kilonova contribution is plausible, it is not favoured due
to the low temperature and high luminosity required, implying superluminal
expansion and a large ejecta mass of $\sim 0.1$ M$_{\odot}$. We find, instead,
that the transient is broadly consistent with power-law spectra with additional
dust extinction of $E(B-V)\sim0.4$ mag, although a possibly thermal excess
remains in the \textit{z}-band. We investigate the host, a spiral galaxy with
an edge-on orientation, resolving its spectrum along its major axis to
construct the galaxy rotation curve and analyse the star formation and chemical

fundamental idea is that the termination proof encapsulates the flows of the
program which are relevant for the cost computation so that, by driving the
generation of the CRS using the termination proof, we produce a
linearly-bounded CRS (LB-CRS). A LB-CRS is composed of cost functions that are
guaranteed to be locally bounded by linear ranking functions and thus greatly
simplify the process of CRS solving. We have built a new resource analysis
tool, named MaxCore, that is guided by the VeryMax termination analyzer and
uses CoFloCo and PUBS as CRS solvers. Our experimental results on the set of

problems (TPBVPs) with conditions of optimality derived from the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. In most cases, it is challenging to
solve HJBs due to the difficulty of guessing the adjoint variables. This paper
proposes two learning-based approaches to find the initial guess of adjoint
variables in real-time, which can be applied to solve general TPBVPs. For cases
with database of solutions and corresponding adjoint variables of a TPBVP under
varying boundary conditions, a supervised learning method is applied to learn
the HJB solutions off-line. After obtaining a trained neural network from
supervised learning, we are able to find proper initial adjoint variables for
given boundary conditions in real-time. However, when validated solutions of
TPBVPs are not available, the reinforcement learning method is applied to solve
HJB by constructing a neural network, defining a reward function, and setting
appropriate super parameters. The reinforcement learning based HJB method can
learn how to find accurate adjoint variables via an updating neural network.
Finally, both learning approaches are implemented in classical optimal control
problems to verify the effectiveness of the learning based HJB methods.

radially migrate on order a scale length over the disk's lifetime. With the
exception of cold torquing, also known as ""churning,"" processes that contribute
to the radial migration of stars are necessarily associated with kinematic
heating. Additionally, it is an open question whether or not an episode of cold
torquing is kinemically cold over long radial distances. This study uses a
suite of analytically based simulations to investigate the dynamical response
when stars are subject to cold torquing and are also resonant with an
ultraharmonic. Model results demonstrate that these populations are
kinematically heated and have RMS changes in orbital angular momentum around
corotation that can exceed those of populations that do not experience resonant
overlap. Thus, kinematic heating can occur during episodes of cold torquing. In
a case study of a Milky Way-like disk with an exponential surface density
profile and flat rotation curve, up to 40% of cold torqued stars in the solar
cylinder experience resonant overlap. This fraction increases toward the
galactic center. To first approximation, the maximum radial excursions from
cold torquing depend only on the strength of the spiral pattern and the
underlying rotation curve. This work places an upper limit to these excursions
to be the distance between the ultraharmonics, otherwise radial migration near
corotation can kinematically heat. The diffusion rate for kinematically cold
radial migration is thus constrained by limiting the step size in the random
walk approximation.

equilibria in games. Most of the literature in this area has focused on
establishing worst-case bounds for specific classes of games, such as routing
games or more general congestion games. Recently, the price of anarchy in
routing games has been studied as a function of the traffic demand, providing
asymptotic results in light and heavy traffic. The aim of this paper is to
study the price of anarchy in nonatomic routing games in the intermediate
region of the demand. To achieve this goal, we begin by establishing some
smoothness properties of Wardrop equilibria and social optima for general
smooth costs. In the case of affine costs we show that the equilibrium is
piecewise linear, with break points at the demand levels at which the set of
active paths changes. We prove that the number of such break points is finite,
although it can be exponential in the size of the network. Exploiting a scaling
law between the equilibrium and the social optimum, we derive a similar
behavior for the optimal flows. We then prove that in any interval between
break points the price of anarchy is smooth and it is either monotone
(decreasing or increasing) over the full interval, or it decreases up to a
certain minimum point in the interior of the interval and increases afterwards.
We deduce that for affine costs the maximum of the price of anarchy can only
occur at the break points. For general costs we provide counterexamples showing
that the set of break points is not always finite.

a physical image with its downsampled counterpart. The high-resolution image
covers about 25% of the view field of the low-resolution image, and the
objective is to enhance the area of the low-resolution image where there is no

electron imaging is different from that of optical (visible light) photos. The
implication is that super-resolution models trained by optical photos are not

operations in cubic order of the number of spatial locations and dynamic memory
storage in quadratic order. Recent developments in spatial statistics offer a
variety of massively scalable approaches. Bayesian inference and hierarchical
models, in particular, have gained popularity due to their richness and
flexibility in accommodating spatial processes. Our current contribution is to
provide computationally efficient exact algorithms for spatial interpolation of
massive data sets using scalable spatial processes. We combine low-rank
Gaussian processes with efficient sparse approximations. Following recent work
by [1], we model the low-rank process using a Gaussian predictive process (GPP)

process (NNGP). A key contribution here is to implement these models using
exact conjugate Bayesian modeling to avoid expensive iterative algorithms.

explored TESS photometric observations of AU Mic that are consistent with
evidence of two starspot complexes in the system. The likely co-alignment of
the stellar and disk rotational axes breaks degeneracies in detailed spot
modeling, indicating that AU Mic's projected magnetic field axis is offset from
its rotational axis. We speculate that small grains in AU Mic's disk could be
sculpted by a time-dependent wind that is influenced by this offset magnetic
field axis, analogous to co-rotating Solar interaction regions that sculpt and
influence the inner and outer regions of our own Heliosphere. Alternatively, if
the observed spot modulation is indicative of a significant mis-alignment of
the stellar and disk rotational axes, we suggest the disk could still be
sculpted by the differential equatorial versus polar wind that it sees with
every stellar rotation.

by many factors acting at different spatial and temporal scales. Several models
have been proposed which differ primarily in the temporal conceptualization,
namely continuous and discrete time formulations. Naturally, animal movement
occurs in continuous time but we tend to observe it at fixed time intervals. To
account for the temporal mismatch between observations and movement decisions,
we used a state-space model where movement decisions (steps and turns) are made
in continuous time. The movement process is then observed at regular time
intervals. As the likelihood function of this state-space model turned out to
be complex to calculate yet simulating data is straightforward, we conduct
inference using a few variations of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). We
explore the applicability of these methods as a function of the discrepancy
between the temporal scale of the observations and that of the movement process
in a simulation study. We demonstrate the application of this model to a real
trajectory of a sheep that was reconstructed in high resolution using
information from magnetometer and GPS devices. Our results suggest that
accurate estimates can be obtained when the observations are less than 5 times
the average time between changes in movement direction. The state-space model
used here allowed us to connect the scales of the observations and movement
decisions in an intuitive and easy to interpret way. Our findings underscore
the idea that the time scale at which animal movement decisions are made needs
to be considered when designing data collection protocols, and that sometimes
high-frequency data may not be necessary to have good estimates of certain
movement processes.

needs Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by specific quantum states.
Recently, in [A. Salavrakos et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 040402 (2017)] a
general class of Bell inequalities, with arbitrary numbers of measurements and
outcomes, has been designed, which are maximally violated by the maximally
entangled states of two quantum systems of arbitrary dimension. In this work,
we generalize these results to the multipartite scenario and obtain a general
class of Bell inequalities maximally violated by the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of any number of parties and any local
dimension. We then derive analytically their maximal quantum and nonsignaling
values. We also obtain analytically the bound for detecting genuine nonlocality
and compute the fully local bound for a few exemplary cases. Moreover, we
consider the question of adapting this class of inequalities to partially
entangled GHZ-like states for some special cases of low dimension and small
number of parties. Through numerical methods, we find classes of inequalities
maximally violated by these partially entangled states.

work aims to test models for YSC formation and obtain an insight into the
formation processes at work in part of the local galaxy population. We find
that the models used in E-MOSAICS for the cluster formation efficiency and
high-mass truncation of the initial cluster mass function ($M_\mathrm{c,\ast}$)
both quantitatively reproduce the observed values of cluster populations in
nearby galaxies. At higher redshifts ($z \geq 2$, near the peak of globular
cluster formation) we find that, at a constant star formation rate (SFR)
surface density, $M_\mathrm{c,\ast}$ is larger than at $z=0$ by a factor of
four due to the higher gas fractions in the simulated high-redshift galaxies.
Similar processes should be at work in local galaxies, offering a new way to
test the models. We find that cluster age distributions may be sensitive to
variations in the cluster formation rate (but not SFR) with time, which may
significantly affect their use in tests of cluster mass loss. By comparing
simulations with different implementations of cluster formation physics, we
find that (even partially) environmentally-independent cluster formation is
inconsistent with the brightest cluster-SFR and specific
luminosity-$\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ relations, whereas these observables are
reproduced by the fiducial, environmentally-varying model. This shows that
models in which a constant fraction of stars form in clusters are inconsistent

the score, but also to stabilise the prediction performance since this is a
mandatory requirement for use in automated and semi-automated workflows in the
clinical environment.
  The framework is validated with an architecture comparison to show CNN
architecture-independent effects of our framework functionality. We compare a
modified U-Net and a modified Mixed-Scale Dense Network (MS-D Net) to compare
dilated convolutions for parallel multi-scale processing to the U-Net approach
based on traditional scaling operations. Finally, we propose an ensemble model
combining the strengths of different individual methods. The framework performs
well on a range of tasks such as liver and kidney segmentation, without
significant differences in prediction performance on strongly differing volume
sizes and varying slice thickness. Thus our framework is an essential step
towards performing robust segmentation of unknown real-world samples.

Direct Numerical Simulations in an elongated domain, which is in the direction
of rotation about $340$ times larger than the typical initial eddy size. First,
by following the time evolution of the integral length-scale along the axis of
rotation $\ell_{\|}$, the growth rate of the columnar eddies and its dependency
on the Rossby number $ Ro_{\varepsilon}$ is determined as $\gamma =4 \exp(-17
Ro_{\varepsilon})$, where $\gamma$ is the non-dimensional growth rate. Second,
a scaling law for the energy dissipation rate $\varepsilon$ is sought.
Comparison with current available scaling laws shows that the relation proposed
by Baqui & Davidson (2015), i.e., $\varepsilon\sim u'^3/\ell_{\|}$, where $u's$
is the r.m.s. velocity, approximates well part of our data, more specifically
the range $0.39\le Ro_{\varepsilon} \le 1.54$. However, relations proposed in
the literature fail to model the data for the second and most interesting
range, i.e., $0.06\le Ro_{\varepsilon} \le 0.31$, which is marked by the
formation of columnar eddies. To find a similarity relation for the latter, we
exploit the concept of a spectral transfer time introduced by Kraichnan (1965).
Within this framework, the energy dissipation rate is considered to depend on
both the non-linear time-scale and the relaxation time-scale. Thus, by
analyzing our data, expressions for these different time-scales are obtained
that results in~$\varepsilon\sim u'^4/(\ell_{\bot}^2 Ro_{\varepsilon}^{0.62}
\tau_{nl})$, where $\ell_{\bot}$ is the integral length-scale in the direction
normal to the axis of rotation and $\tau_{nl}$ is the non-liner time-scale of
the initial homogeneous isotropic field.

$\Theta (n)$ steps to complete which hinders its scalability on parallel

  In this work, in order to improve the scalability of BP, we reformulate BP
into a scan operation which is a primitive that performs an in-order
aggregation on a sequence of values and returns the partial result at each

modified version of the Blelloch scan algorithm which theoretically takes
$\Theta (\log n)$ steps. We evaluate our approach on a vanilla Recurrent Neural

lies at the hearth of this study which presents a comprehensive investigation
of the fracturing behavior of notched quasi-isotropic [+45/90/$-$45/0]$_{s}$
and cross-ply [0/90]$_{2s}$ laminates under multi-axial quasi-static and
fatigue loading.
  The investigation of the S-N curves and stiffness degradation, and the
analysis of the damage mechanisms via micro-computed tomography clarified the
effects of the multi-axiality ratio and the notch configuration. Furthermore,
it allowed to conclude that damage progression under fatigue loading can be
substantially different compared to the quasi-static case.
  Future efforts in the formulation of efficient fatigue models will need to
account for the transition in damaging behavior in the context of the type of
applied load, the evolution of the local multi-axiality ratio, the structure
size and geometry, and stacking sequence. By providing important data for model

an equation of state $w=-1$, despite the scalar's zero temperature potential
having only a 4D Minkowski or AdS vacuum. For scalar masses $\lesssim \mu$eV,
which could be technically natural via sequestering, there are large regions of
phenomenologically viable parameter space such that the induced vacuum energy
matches the measured dark energy density. Additionally, in many models a
standard cosmological history automatically leads to the scalar having the
required initial conditions. We study the possible observational signals of
such a model, including at fifth force experiments and through $\Delta N_{\rm

resolve the tension between different measurements of $H_0$ and can lead to a

upon an observed event, corresponding to a multiplication of the density by the
intensity function of the observation process. If that distribution is
represented by unweighted samples or particles, they need to be jointly
transformed such that they sample from the modified distribution. In previous
work, this transformation has been approximated by a translation of all the
particles by a common vector. However, such an operation is ill-defined on a
manifold, and on a vector space, a constant gain can lead to a wrong estimate
of the uncertainty over the hidden state. Here, taking inspiration from the
feedback particle filter (FPF), we derive an asymptotically exact filter
(called ppFPF) for point process observations, whose particles evolve according
to intrinsic (i.e. parametrization-invariant) dynamics that are composed of the
dynamics of the hidden state plus additional control terms. While not sharing
the gain-times-error structure of the FPF, the optimal control terms are
expressed as solutions to partial differential equations analogous to the
weighted Poisson equation for the gain of the FPF. The proposed filter can
therefore make use of existing approximation algorithms for solutions of
weighted Poisson equations.

learning the distribution of normal data. Backpropagation neural networks
(i.e., BP-NNs) based approaches have recently drawn attention because of their
good generalization capability. In a typical situation, BP-NN-based models are
iteratively optimized in server machines with input data gathered from edge
devices. However, (1) the iterative optimization often requires significant
efforts to follow changes in the distribution of normal data (i.e., concept
drift), and (2) data transfers between edge and server impose additional
latency and energy consumption. To address these issues, we propose ONLAD and
its IP core, named ONLAD Core. ONLAD is highly optimized to perform fast
sequential learning to follow concept drift in less than one millisecond. ONLAD
Core realizes on-device learning for edge devices at low power consumption,
which realizes standalone execution where data transfers between edge and
server are not required. Experiments show that ONLAD has favorable anomaly
detection capability in an environment that simulates concept drift.
Evaluations of ONLAD Core confirm that the training latency is 1.95x~6.58x
faster than the other software implementations. Also, the runtime power
consumption of ONLAD Core implemented on PYNQ-Z1 board, a small FPGA/CPU SoC

satifying the two-sided limit shadowing property satisfy even the specification

two-stage detectors and one-stage detectors. Recently, many efforts have been
devoted to one-stage detectors for the simple yet effective architecture.
Different from two-stage detectors, one-stage detectors aim to identify
foreground objects from all candidates in a single stage. This architecture is
efficient but can suffer from the imbalance issue with respect to two aspects:
the inter-class imbalance between the number of candidates from foreground and
background classes and the intra-class imbalance in the hardness of background
candidates, where only a few candidates are hard to be identified. In this
work, we propose a novel distributional ranking (DR) loss to handle the
challenge. For each image, we convert the classification problem to a ranking
problem, which considers pairs of candidates within the image, to address the
inter-class imbalance problem. Then, we push the distributions of confidence
scores for foreground and background towards the decision boundary. After that,
we optimize the rank of the expectations of derived distributions in lieu of
original pairs. Our method not only mitigates the intra-class imbalance issue
in background candidates but also improves the efficiency for the ranking
algorithm. By merely replacing the focal loss in RetinaNet with the developed
DR loss and applying ResNet-101 as the backbone, mAP of the single-scale test

relation of the transmission line. This is obtained using a periodic modulation
of the SQUID size, similarly to what is done with photonic crystals. Moreover,
we provide a new theoretical treatment to describe the non-trivial interplay

channels are important to guarantee confidentiality. Although static analysis
remains the prevalent approach for detecting timing side channels, it is
computationally challenging for real-world applications. In addition, the
detection techniques are usually restricted to 'yes' or 'no' answers. In
practice, real-world applications may need to leak information about the
secret. Therefore, quantification techniques are necessary to evaluate the
resulting threats of information leaks. Since both problems are very difficult
or impossible for static analysis techniques, we propose a dynamic analysis
method. Our novel approach is to split the problem into two tasks. First, we
learn a timing model of the program as a neural network. Second, we analyze the
neural network to quantify information leaks. As demonstrated in our
experiments, both of these tasks are feasible in practice --- making the
approach a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art side channel
detectors and quantifiers. Our key technical contributions are (a) a neural
network architecture that enables side channel discovery and (b) an MILP-based
algorithm to estimate the side-channel strength. On a set of micro-benchmarks

behaviors of programs with thousands of methods. We also show that neural

positively impact traditional stop-motion animation. As 3D printing every frame
of a computer animation is prohibitively slow and expensive, 3D printed
stop-motion can only be viable if animations can be faithfully reproduced using
a compact library of 3D printed and efficiently assemblable parts. We thus
present the first system for processing computer animation sequences (typically
faces) to produce an optimal set of replacement parts for use in 3D printed
stop-motion animation. Given an input animation sequence of topology invariant
deforming meshes, our problem is to output a library of replacement parts and
per-animation-frame assignment of the parts, such that we maximally approximate
the input animation, while minimizing the amount of 3D printing and assembly.
Inspired by current stop-motion workflows, a user manually indicates which
parts of the model are preferred for segmentation; then, we find curves with
minimal deformation along which to segment the mesh. We then present a novel
algorithm to zero out deformations along the segment boundaries, so that
replacement sets for each part can be interchangeably and seamlessly assembled
together. The part boundaries are designed to ease 3D printing and
instrumentation for assembly. Each part is then independently optimized using a
graph-cut technique to find a set of replacements, whose size can be user
defined, or automatically computed to adhere to a printing budget or allowed
deviation from the original animation. Our evaluation is threefold: we show
results on a variety of facial animations, both digital and 3D printed,
critiqued by a professional animator; we show the impact of various algorithmic
parameters; and compare our results to naive solutions. Our approach can reduce

Learning-based model utilizes real driving data to model the human behaviors.
Depending on the structure of the data, learning-based models can predict both

State-of-the-art Bragg interferometers are rapidly surpassing technical

set by uncorrelated atoms. Despite the use of large numbers of atoms, their
operation is governed by single-atom physics. Motivated by recent proposals and
demonstrations of Raman gravimeters in cavities, we propose a scheme to squeeze
directly on momentum states for surpassing the projection noise limit in Bragg
interferometers. In our modeling, we consider the unique issues that arise when
a spin squeezing protocol is applied to momentum pseudospins. Specifically, we
study the effects of the momentum width of the atomic cloud and the coupling to
momentum states outside the pseudospin manifold, as these atoms interact via a
mode of the cavity. We show that appreciable levels of spin squeezing can be
demonstrated in suitable parameter regimes in spite of these complications.
Using this setting, we show how beyond mean-field techniques developed for spin
systems can be adapted to study the dynamics of momentum states of interacting

experimentally attractive because it requires no additional setup beyond what

overtone bulk acoustic wave resonances (HBAR resonances) in the photonic stack.
These confined mechanical stress waves transmit exhibit vertically
transmitting, high quality factor (Q) acoustic Fabry Perot resonances that
extend into the Gigahertz domain, and offer stress-optical interaction with the
optical modes of the microresonator. Although HBAR are ubiquitously used in
modern communication, and often exploited in superconducting circuits, this is
the first time they have been incorporated on a photonic circuit based chip.
The electro-acousto-optical interaction observed within the optical modes
exhibits high actuation linearity, low actuation power and negligible
crosstalk. Using the electro-acousto-optic interaction, fast optical resonance
tuning is achieved with sub-nanosecond transduction time. By removing the
silicon backreflection, broadband acoustic modulation at 4.1 and 8.7 GHz is
realized with a 3 dB bandwidth of 250 MHz each. The novel hybrid HBAR
nanophotonic platform demonstrated here, allowing on chip integration of
micron-scale acoustic and photonic resonators, can find immediate applications
in tunable microwave photonics, high bandwidth soliton microcomb stabilization,
compact opto-electronic oscillators, and in microwave to optical conversion
schemes. Moreover the hybrid platform allows implementation of momentum
biasing, which allows realization of on chip non-reciprocal devices such as
isolators or circulators and topological photonic bandstructures.

augmented Lagrangian method (LALM) to design an event-triggered decentralized

triggering time instants for each agent are locally determined by comparing the
deviation between true and broadcast primal variables with certain triggering

new upper bound for the effect of triggering behavior on the primal-dual
residual. Based on this, the same convergence rate $O(\frac{1}{k})$ with
periodic algorithms is secured for nonsmooth convex problems. Stronger
convergence results have been further established for strongly convex and
smooth problems, that is, the iterates linearly converge with exponentially
decaying triggering thresholds.} We examine the developed strategy in two
common optimization problems; comparison results illustrate its performance and

  Astrovisualization practitioners need a wide variety of specialized skills

astrophysics research continues to evolve into a more data rich science,
astroviz is also evolving from artists conceptions to data-driven
visualizations, from two-dimensional images to three-dimensional prints,
requiring new skills for development. Currently astroviz practitioners are
spread throughout the country. Due to the specialized nature of the field there
are seldom enough practitioners at one location to form an effective research

Because of the increasing importance of visualization in modern astrophysics,
the fact that the astroviz community is small and spread out in disparate

conversion (VC) with the use of cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)-based
spectral modeling. In a variational autoencoder(VAE) framework, a latent space,
usually with a Gaussian prior, is used to encode a set of input features. In a
VAE-based VC, the encoded latent features are fed into a decoder, along with
speaker-coding features, to generate estimated spectra with either the original
speaker identity (reconstructed) or another speaker identity (converted). Due
to the non-parallel modeling condition, the converted spectra can not be
directly optimized, which heavily degrades the performance of a VAE-based VC.
In this work, to overcome this problem, we propose to use CycleVAE-based
spectral model that indirectly optimizes the conversion flow by recycling the
converted features back into the system to obtain corresponding cyclic
reconstructed spectra that can be directly optimized. The cyclic flow can be
continued by using the cyclic reconstructed features as input for the next
cycle. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
CycleVAE-based VC, which yields higher accuracy of converted spectra, generates
latent features with higher correlation degree, and significantly improves the
quality and conversion accuracy of the converted speech.

electronic structure. Examples are the spontaneous ionization, stabilization of
excited-state configurations that result in a level-crossing with the ground
state of the free atom, and contraction of atomic shells. In this work, we do a
systematic study of the effects of confinement with harmonic potential on the
electronic structure of atoms from H to Ne. Dynamic and static correlation is
taken into account by performing CCSD and CASSCF calculations, respectively.
Because the strength of harmonic confinement cannot be translated into
pressure, we envisioned a ""calibration"" method to transform confinement into
pressure. We focused on the effect of confinement on: i) changes of electron
distribution and localization within the $K$ and $L$ atomic shells, ii)
confinement-induced ionization pressure, iii) level crossing of electronic
states, and iv) the electron correlation energy. We found that contraction of
valence and core shells are not negligible and that the use of standard
pseudopotentials might be not adequate to study solids under extreme pressures.
The critical pressure at which and atom ionizes follows a periodic trend, and
it ranges from $28$ GPa for Li to $10.8$ TPa for Ne. In Li and a Be, pressure
induces mixing of the ground state configuration with excited states. At high
pressure, the ground state of Li and Be becomes a doublet and a triplet with
configurations $1s^22p$ and $1s^22s2p$ respectively. The potential consequences
of these changes of configuration on the chemistry of Be are discussed.
Finally, the changes in the amount of electron correlation are characterized
and analyzed in terms of the RPA approximation. For atoms with fewer electrons
in the valence shell correlation increases, but for atoms with more electron,
the increasing of kinetic energy dominates over electron correlation.

efficiency of 45\% for shower-driven events with a Signal-to-noise ratio

This technique enables more efficient detection of cosmic rays over a wider

detectors and can be easily adapted by neutrino experiments relying on RF-only

good agreement with the experimental measurements. Our results may also be
directly applicable to a few-fermion system prepared in microtraps and optical

moment uses the difference of two (central) Hessian approximations to resolve
the potential low-regularity of viscosity solutions. It is proved that the

Method: We conducted an interview survey of eleven participants from eight
organisations to investigate what onboarding activities are common across Agile
software development teams. We also identify common goals of onboarding from a
synthesis of literature. A repertory grid instrument is used to map the
contributions of onboarding techniques to onboarding goals. Results: Our study

challenges towards federated learning (FL), which include application expansion
and homomorphic encryption (HE). The former aims to expand the applicable
machine learning models of FL. The latter focuses on who holds the secret key
when applying HE to FL. For the naive HE scheme, the server is set to master
the secret key. Such a setting causes a serious problem that if the server does
not conduct aggregation before decryption, a chance is left for the server to
access the user's update. Inspired by the two challenges, we propose FedXGB, a
federated extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) scheme supporting forced
aggregation. FedXGB mainly achieves the following two breakthroughs. First,
FedXGB involves a new HE based secure aggregation scheme for FL. By combining
the advantages of secret sharing and homomorphic encryption, the algorithm can
solve the second challenge mentioned above, and is robust to the user dropout.
Then, FedXGB extends FL to a new machine learning model by applying the secure
aggregation scheme to the classification and regression tree building of
XGBoost. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments to evaluate the security, effectiveness, and efficiency
of FedXGB. The results indicate that FedXGB achieves less than 1% accuracy loss
compared with the original XGBoost, and can provide about 23.9% runtime and
33.3% communication reduction for HE based model update aggregation of FL.

communities, of which the methods based on planar markers are easy to be
implemented. However, most of the existing methods need to identify multiple
points in the marker images for matching to space points. Then, PnP and RANSAC
are used to compute the camera pose. If cameras move fast or are far away from
markers, matching is easy to generate errors and even RANSAC cannot remove
incorrect matching. Then, the result by PnP cannot have good performance. To
solve this problem, we design circular markers and represent 6D camera pose
analytically and unifiedly as very concise forms from each of the marker by
projective invariance. Afterwards, the pose is further optimized by a proposed
nonlinear cost function based on a polar-n-direction geometric distance. The
method is from imaged circle edges and without PnP/RANSAC, making pose tracking
robust and accurate. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms the state of the arts in terms of noise, blur, and distance from
camera to marker. Simultaneously, it can still run at about 100 FPS on a
consumer computer with only CPU.

Recently, theoretical treatments have suggested that such transitions require
the itinerant electrons be decoupled from the soft transverse optical phonons
responsible for polar order. However, this decoupled electron mechanism (DEM)
has yet to be experimentally observed. Here we utilize ultrafast spectroscopy
to uncover evidence of the DEM in LiOsO$_3$, the first known band metal to
undergo a thermally driven polar phase transition ($T_c$ =140 K). We
demonstrate that intra-band photo-carriers relax by selectively coupling to
only a subset of the phonon spectrum, leaving as much as 60 % of the lattice
heat capacity decoupled. This decoupled heat capacity is shown to be consistent
with a previously undetected and partially displacive TO polar mode, indicating
the DEM in LiOsO$_3$.

maximum polarization efficiency, which corresponds to $\lambda$/2$\pi$ $\sim$
140 $\mu$m in grain radius. In the outer region, we detect $\sim$1.0\%
polarization and find that the polarization orientations are almost in the
azimuthal directions. Moreover, the polarization orientations have systematic
angular deviations from the azimuthal directions with $\Delta$$\theta$ $\sim$
4\fdg5 $\pm$ 1\fdg6. The pattern is consistent with a model that radially
drifting dust grains are aligned by the gas flow against the dust grains. We

Ontological emergence can obtain between theories that have the same extension

more effective policies. However, existing methods may overly exploit past
successful experiences, which can encourage the agent to adopt sub-optimal and
myopic behaviors. In this work, instead of focusing on good experiences with

allows the agent to reach diverse regions in the state space and improve upon
the past trajectories to reach new states. We empirically show that our

Then, we investigate the effect of inhomogeneity (spatially varying dispersion,

potential strengths, namely periodic (optical lattice) with specific reference
to hyperbolic type potentials and parabolic cylinder potentials. First, we show
an interesting oscillating boomeronic behaviour of dark-bright solitons due to
Rabi coupling in two component-condensate with constant nonlinearities. Then in
the presence of inhomogeneity but in the absence of Rabi coupling we
demonstrate creation of new daughter RWs co-existing with dark (bright) soliton
part in first (second) component of the two-component GP system. Further, the
hyperbolic modulation (sech type) of parameter along with Rabi effect leads to
the formation of dromion (two-dimensional localized structure) trains even in
the (1+1) dimensional two-component GP system, which is a striking feature of
Rabi coupling with spatial modulation. Next, our study on three-component
condensate, reveals the fact that the three RWs can be converted into broad
based zero background RW appearing on top of a bright soliton by introducing
spatial modulation only. Further, by including Rabi coupling we observe beating
behaviour of solitons with internal oscillations mostly at the wings. Also, we
show that by employing parabolic cylinder modulation with model parameter $n$,

with magnitude between Mw 5.5 to 6.5. As a consequence, numerous residential
buildings in the affected area was not particularly resistant to the shaking,
resulting in the collapse and heavy damage. With a particular focus on masonry
infilled steel frames, this paper evaluates the seismic performance of an
infilled moment-resisting steel frame located in Amatrice, Central Italy, which
suffered significant damage during the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake.
The aim is to investigate the effect of the masonry infill to the seismic

modeled using the Opensees software, where the beam and column elements are
modeled by using a nonlinear hinge model and the infill is idealized as
diagonal struts with nonlinear hysteretic behavior. Nonlinear static and
dynamic analyses are performed for both bare and infill frames in order to
assess the effect of the masonry infill on the overall seismic response and

Designers often look for tools to help classify and categorize the data.
Traditional machine learning techniques for time-series data offer several
solutions to solve these problems; however, the artifacts trained by these
algorithms often lack interpretability. On the other hand, temporal logics,
such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) have been successfully used in the formal
methods community as specifications of time-series behaviors. In this work, we
propose a new technique to automatically learn temporal logic formulae that are
able to cluster and classify real-valued time-series data. Previous work on
learning STL formulas from data either assumes a formula-template to be given
by the user, or assumes some special fragment of STL that enables exploring the
formula structure in a systematic fashion. In our technique, we relax these
assumptions, and provide a way to systematically explore the space of all STL
formulas. As the space of all STL formulas is very large, and contains many
semantically equivalent formulas, we suggest a technique to heuristically prune
the space of formulas considered. Finally, we illustrate our technique on
various case studies from the automotive, transportation and healthcare domain.

alleviate these problems by proposing a discriminative consistent domain
generation (DCDG) approach to achieve a semi-supervised learning. The
discriminative consistent domain is achieved by a double-sided domain
adaptation. The double-sided domain adaptation aims to make a fusion of the
feature spaces of labeled data and unlabeled data. In this way, we can fit the
differences of various distributions between labeled data and unlabeled data.
In order to keep the discriminativeness of generated consistent domain for the
task learning, we apply an indirect learning for the double-sided domain
adaptation. Based on the generated discriminative consistent domain, we can use
the unlabeled data to learn the task model along with the labeled data via a
consistent image generation. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed
DCDG on the late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MRI (LGE-CMRI) images acquired
from patients with atrial fibrillation in two clinical centers for the
segmentation of the left atrium anatomy (LA) and proximal pulmonary veins

onto a content photo in a natural fashion, such that the stylized image looks
like a real photo taken by a camera. State-of-the-art methods stylize the image
locally within each matched semantic region and are prone to global color
inconsistency across semantic objects/parts, making the stylized image less
photorealistic. To tackle the challenging issues, we propose a non-local
representation scheme, constrained with a mutual affine-transfer network
(NL-MAT). Through a dictionary-based decomposition, NL-MAT is able to
successfully decouple matched non-local representations and color information
of the image pair, such that the context correspondence between the image pair
is incorporated naturally, which largely facilitates local style transfer in a
global-consistent fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to address the photorealistic stylization problem with a non-local
representation scheme, such that no additional models or steps for semantic
matching are required during stylization. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method is able to generate photorealistic results with local style
transfer while preserving both the spatial structure and global color
consistency of the content image.

the complexity of the receiver. The first all-analog adaptive equalizer for

that the use of all-analog processing for short-reach data-center interconnects

duality through string theory on certain spacetimes. Via this correspondence we
consider a stack of $N_{0}$ dynamical D0-branes as D-instantons in the
background sourced by $N_{c}$ coincident non-extreme black D4-branes. According
to the gauge-gravity duality this D0-D4 brane system corresponds to Yang-Mills
theory with a theta angle at finite temperature. We solve the IIA supergravity
action by taking account into a sufficiently small backreaction of the
D-instantons and obtain an analytical solution for our D0-D4-brane
configuration. Then the dual theory in the large $N_{c}$ limit can be
holographically investigated with the gravity solution. In the dual field
theory, we find the coupling constant exhibits the property of asymptotic
freedom as it is expected in QCD. The contribution of the theta-dependence to
the free energy gets suppressed at high temperature which is basically
consistent with the calculation by using the Yang-Mills instanton. The
topological susceptibility in the large $N_{c}$ limit vanishes and this
behavior remarkably agrees with the implications from the simulation results at

immune system to detect and eliminate tumors in the body. A highly simplified
version of this process can be studied in a Petri dish: starting with a random
distribution of immune and tumor cells, it can be observed in detail how
individual immune cells migrate towards nearby tumor cells, establish contact,
and attack. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the immune cells find
their targets by chance, or if they approach them 'on purpose', using remote
sensing mechanisms such as chemotaxis. In this work, we present methods to
infer the strength and range of long-range cell-cell interactions from
time-lapse recorded cell trajectories, using a maximum likelihood method to fit
the model parameters. First, we model the interactions as a distance-dependent
'force' that attracts immune cells towards their nearest tumor cell. While this
approach correctly recovers the interaction parameters of simulated cells with
constant migration properties, it detects spurious interactions in the case of
independent cells that spontaneously change their migration behavior over time.
We therefore use an alternative approach that models the interactions by
distance-dependent probabilities for positive and negative turning angles of
the migrating immune cell. We demonstrate that the latter approach finds the
correct interaction parameters even with temporally switching cell migration.

specific piece of information with $|\Psi \rangle$, our proposal is to encode
such information in the separable state with the minimal distance to the
measured state $|\Phi \rangle$ that is obtained by partially measuring on

to the compressed sensing with neural-network machine learning is suggested,
where the measurements are designed to minimize uncertainty of information from

have $|\Phi \rangle$ can reliably access the information by simply measuring on

q-sparsity is essentially due to the fact that the TN states describing nicely
the probability distribution obey the area law of entanglement entropy. Testing
on realistic datasets (hand-written digits and fashion images), TNCS is shown
to possess high efficiency and accuracy, where the security of communications

bowtie gap periphery, even while the electron beam probes their center. Our

a typical problem arising, e.g., in sparse spikes deconvolution or two-layer

discretizing the measure and running non-convex gradient descent on the

scalar field configurations in the action, we derive degeneracy conditions to
obtain an effective field theory with three degrees of freedom. However,
performing the Hamiltonian analysis for a generic scalar field we show that
there are in general four or more degrees of freedom. The discrepancy is
resolved because, for a homogeneous scalar field profile,
$\partial_i\varphi\approx 0$, the Dirac matrix becomes singular, resulting in
further constraints, which reduces the number of degrees of freedom to three.
Similarly, in linear perturbation theory the additional scalar degree of
freedom can only be seen by considering a non-homogeneous background profile of
the scalar field. Therefore, restricting to homogeneous scalar fields these
kinds of models provide viable explicitly Lorentz violating effective field
theories of mimetic gravity.

Particularly, we elaborately design a gated feature-wise transform layer in
EC-CNN to adaptively incorporate edge prior knowledge. The whole EC-CNN is
end-to-end trained, and can generate high-quality segmentation results with the

so far. The diffuse emission extends over $\sim$ 1 Mpc and has a morphology
similar to that of the X-ray emission as revealed by XMM-Newton data. The halo
is very faint at higher frequencies and is barely detected by follow-up 1-2 GHz
Karl G.~Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) observations, which enable us to
constrain the radio spectral index to be $\alpha\leq 1.5-1.6$, i.e.; with
properties between canonical and ultra-steep spectrum radio halos. Radio halos
are currently explained as synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons
that are re-accelerated in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by turbulence driven
by energetic mergers. We show that in such a framework radio halos are expected
to be relatively common at $\sim150$ MHz ($\sim30-60\%$) in clusters with mass

origin and amplification of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters.

compression. A compact torus (CT) is formed with a co-axial gun into a
containment region with an hour-glass shaped inner flux conserver, and an
insulating outer wall. External coil currents keep the CT off the outer wall
(radial levitation) and then rapidly compress it inwards. The optimal external
coil configuration greatly improved both the levitated CT lifetime and the rate
of shots with good flux conservation during compression. As confirmed by
spectrometer data, the improved levitation field profile reduced plasma
impurity levels by suppressing the interaction between plasma and the
insulating outer wall during the formation process. Significant increases in
magnetic field, density, and ion temperature were routinely observed at
magnetic compression despite the prevalence of an instability, thought be an
external kink, at compression. Matching the decay rate of the levitation coil
currents to that of the internal CT currents resulted in a reduced level of MHD
activity associated with unintentional compression by the levitation field, and
a higher probability of long-lived CTs. An axisymmetric finite element MHD code

where arbitrary nodes (whose identities are not known apriori) can join and
leave at will, we extend established research in scalable Byzantine agreement
to a more practical model where each node (initially) does not know the
identity of other nodes. A node can send to new destinations only by sending to
random (or arbitrary) nodes, or responding (if it chooses) to messages received
from those destinations. We assume a synchronous and fully-connected network,
with a full-information, but static Byzantine adversary. A general drawback of
existing Byzantine protocols is that the communication cost incurred by the
honest nodes may not be proportional to those incurred by the Byzantine nodes;
in fact, they can be significantly higher. Our goal is to design Byzantine
protocols for fundamental problems which are {\em resource competitive}, i.e.,
the number of bits sent by honest nodes is not much more than those sent by
Byzantine nodes.
  We describe a randomized scalable algorithm to solve Byzantine agreement,
leader election, and committee election in this model. Our algorithm sends an
expected $O((T+n)\log n)$ bits and has latency $O(polylog(n))$, where $n$ is
the number of nodes, and $T$ is the minimum of $n^2$ and the number of bits
sent by adversarially controlled nodes. The algorithm is resilient to
$(1/4-\epsilon)n$ Byzantine nodes for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, and succeeds
with high probability. Our work can be considered as a first application of
resource-competitive analysis to fundamental Byzantine problems.
  To complement our algorithm we also show lower bounds for
resource-competitive Byzantine agreement. We prove that, in general, one cannot
hope to design Byzantine protocols that have communication cost that is
significantly smaller than the cost of the Byzantine adversary.

that it is possible to have a measurement of the suppression of power from the

the way to the optical cosmological background radiation, through dust cirri,
mass loss shells in giant stars, LSB galaxies and the intracluster light. These
surface brightness levels (>28-29 mag arcsec^-2) are observed by maximising the
efficiency of the surveys and minimising or removing the systematics arising in
the measurement of surface brightness. Based on full-system photon Monte Carlo
simulations, we present here the performance of a ground-based telescope aimed
at carrying out ULSB observations, with a curved focal surface design. Its
off-axis optical design maximises the field of view while minimising the focal
ratio. No lenses are used, as their multiple internal scatterings increase the
wings of the point spread function (PSF), and the usual requirement of a flat
focal plane is relaxed through the use of curved CCD detectors. The telescope
has only one unavoidable single refractive surface, the cryostat window, and
yet it delivers a PSF with ultra-compact wings, which allows the detection, for

given system can be accurately assessed by symbolically computing the
complexity of the determinant of the observability matrix and quantified by
symbolic observability coefficients. In this work, we extend the symbolic
observability, previously developed for dynamical systems, to networks made of
coupled $d$-dimensional node dynamics ($d>1$). From the observability of the
node dynamics, the coupling function between the nodes, and the adjacency
matrix, it is indeed possible to construct the observability of a large network
with an arbitrary topology.

a proposal Markov jump process with generator $Q$, the purpose of this paper is
to investigate two universal properties enjoyed by two types of
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) processes with generators $M_1(Q,\mu)$ and
$M_2(Q,\mu)$ respectively. First, we motivate our study of $M_2$ by offering a
geometric interpretation of $M_1$, $M_2$ and their convex combinations as $L^1$
minimizers between $Q$ and the set of $\mu$-reversible generators of Markov
jump processes. Second, specializing into the case of $\mathcal{X} =
\mathbb{R}^d$ along with a Gaussian proposal with vanishing variance and Gibbs
target distribution, we prove that, upon appropriate scaling in time, the
family of Markov jump processes corresponding to $M_1$, $M_2$ or their convex
combinations all converge weakly to an universal Langevin diffusion. While
$M_1$ and $M_2$ are seemingly different stochastic dynamics, it is perhaps
surprising that they share these two universal properties. These two results
are known for $M_1$ in Billera and Diaconis (2001) and Gelfand and Mitter

great progress with plausible results. The convolutional neural networks are

repeated strided convolution and spatial pooling layers lower the spatial
resolution of transitional outputs, and several techniques such as skip
connections or multi-layer deconvolutional networks are adopted to recover the
original resolution for effective dense prediction. In this paper, for more
effective guidance of densely encoded features to the desired depth prediction,
we propose a network architecture that utilizes novel local planar guidance
layers located at multiple stages in the decoding phase. We show that the

evaluating on challenging benchmarks. We also provide results from an ablation

reproduce accurately features of level statistics across the transition from

based on the measurement model described as the system of equations. Prior to
applying the state estimation algorithm, the existence and uniqueness of the
solution of the underlying system of equations is determined through the
observability analysis. If a unique solution does not exist, the observability
analysis defines observable islands and further defines an additional set of
equations (measurements) needed to determine a unique solution. For the first
time, we utilise factor graphs and Gaussian belief propagation algorithm to
define a novel observability analysis approach. The observable islands and
placement of measurements to restore observability are identified by following
the evolution of variances across the iterations of the Gaussian belief
propagation algorithm over the factor graph. Due to sparsity of the underlying
power network, the resulting method has the linear computational complexity
(assuming a constant number of iterations) making it particularly suitable for
solving large-scale systems. The method can be flexibly matched to distributed
computational resources, allowing for determination of observable islands and
observability restoration in a distributed fashion. Finally, we discuss
performances of the proposed observability analysis using power systems whose
size ranges between 1354 and 70000 buses.

we find that the CSC treatment reduces the charge redistribution compared to
cheaper one-shot calculations. However, while the MIT in CaVO$_3$ is only

possessing several general features, including the demolition of the state to

degradation of performance under decoherence and dissipation. Here, we propose
an innovative measurement scheme, called dissipative adiabatic measurements
(DAMs), based on which, we further develop an approach to estimation of
parameters characterizing dissipative processes. Unlike a POVM, whose outcome
is one of the eigenvalues of an observable, a DAM yields the expectation value
of the observable as its outcome, without collapsing the state to be measured.
By virtue of the very nature of DAMs, our approach is capable of solving the
estimation problem in a state-protective fashion with only $M$ measurements,
where $M$ is the number of parameters to be estimated. More importantly,
contrary to the common wisdom, it embraces decoherence and dissipation as
beneficial effects and offers a Heisenberg-like scaling of precision, thus
outperforming conventional strategies. Our DAM-based approach is direct,
efficient, and expected to be immensely useful in the context of dissipative

^{42}_{14}Si_{28}$, presented a strong empirical evidence in support of
magicity and sphericity of $^{42}_{14}Si_{28}$. However in complete conflict
with this, Bastin {\it et al.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 (2007) 022503) gave equally
strong empirical evidences, to show that the N = 28 magicity had completely
collapsed, and that $^{42}_{14}Si_{28}$ was a well deformed nucleus. At present
the popular consensus (Gade {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 (2019) 222501)
strongly supports the latter one and discards the former one. Here, while we
accept the latter experiment as being fine and good, through a careful study of
an RMF model calculation, we show that actually the experimental results of
Fridmann are also independently good and consistent. As per the Fridmann
experiment, the sphericity and magicity of $^{42}_{14}Si_{28}$ is manifested
only through proton number Z=14 being a strong magic number, while the neutron
magic number N=28 disappears (or goes into hiding); and still this nucleus is
spherical. This is a new and amazing property manifesting itself in this exotic
nucleus $^{42}_{14}Si_{28}$. In this paper we provide a consistent
understanding of this novel reality within a QCD based model. This model, which
has been successful in explanation of the halo phenomenon in exotic nuclei,
comes forward to provide the physical reason as to why the Fridmann experiment
is correct. This QCD based model shows that it is tritons, as elementary entity
making up $^{42}_{14}Si_{28}$, which then provides consistency to the above
amazing conclusions arising from the Fridmann experiment.

domain disparity minimization for domain adaptation in feature representation.
The paper merits are in three-fold: 1) With the idea that object detectors
often becomes domain incompatible when image distribution resulted domain
disparity appears, we propose a hierarchical domain feature alignment module,
in which multiple adversarial domain classifier submodules for layer-wise
domain feature confusion are designed; 2) An information invariant scale
reduction module (SRM) for hierarchical feature map resizing is proposed for
promoting the training efficiency of adversarial domain adaptation; 3) In order
to improve the domain adaptability, the aggregated proposal features with

threads deformation and materials downward motions. On 2018 February 26, the
two most representative FSAs appeared around 05:21 UT and 06:03 UT,
respectively, and they firstly ascended and then decayed in around 10 minutes.
At the ascending phase, accompanied by the uplifting of an adjacent AFS, each
FSA launches up at one end of the AFS and extends for up to 11 Mm. At the
decaying phase, the FSA gradually vanishes, and materials downflows towards the
other end of the AFS are detected. After checking the evolution of the magnetic
fields of AR 12700, we find that each FSA is located between the end of an AFS

of the collision and compression between these two magnetic patches. We propose
that the collision lifts up the AFS, and then the initially compact AFS
laterally expands, resulting in the formation of FSA. A cartoon model is

supplied by two major vessels: the hepatic artery and the portal vein, various
types of malignant tumors can spread from other organs to the liver. And due to
the liver masses' heterogeneous and diffusive shape, the tumor lesions are very
difficult to be recognized, thus automatic lesion detection is necessary for
the doctors with huge workloads. To assist doctors, this work uses the existing
large-scale annotation medical image data to delve deep into liver lesion
detection from multiple directions. To solve technical difficulties, such as
the image-recognition task, traditional deep learning with convolution neural
networks (CNNs) has been widely applied in recent years. However, this kind of

transport configuration. We unambiguously probe the spin-momentum locking of
the topologically protected surface states by spin-sensitive electrical
read-out using ferromagnetic Co/Al$_2$O$_3$ electrodes. We show that the
non-local measurement allows to probe the surface currents flowing along the
whole surface, i.e. from the top along the side to the bottom surface and back
to the top surface along the opposite side. This is in contrast to local
transport configurations where only the surface states of the one face being in
contact to the electrodes can be measured. Our results furthermore exclude the
contribution of the bulk to the non-local transport at low temperatures.
Increasing the temperature, on the other hand, increases the interaction
between bulk and surface states, which shortens the non-local current path
along the surface and hence leads to a complete disappearance of the non-local
signal at around 20 K. All this demonstrates that the non-local signal at low
temperatures is solely due to the topologically protected surface states.

use of the skin and fat of the lower abdomen to build a new breast mound either
at the same time of the mastectomy or in a second surgery. This operation
requires preoperative imaging studies to evaluate the branches - the
perforators - that irrigate the tissue that will be used to reconstruct the
breast mound. These branches will support tissue viability after the
microsurgical ligation of the inferior epigastric vessels to the receptor
vessels in the thorax. Usually through a Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA),
each perforator, diameter and direction is manually identified by the imaging
team, who will subsequently draw a map for the identification of the best
vascular support for the reconstruction. In the current work we propose a
semi-automatic methodology that aims at reducing the time and subjectivity
inherent to the manual annotation. In 21 CTAs from patients proposed for breast
reconstruction with DIEAP flaps, the subcutaneous region of each perforator was
extracted, by means of a tracking procedure, whereas the intramuscular portion
was detected through a minimum cost approach. Both were subsequently compared
with the radiologist manual annotation. Results showed that the semi-automatic
procedure was able to correctly detect the course of the DIEAPs with a minimum
error (average error of 0.64 mm and 0.50 mm regarding the extraction of
subcutaneous and intramuscular paths, respectively). The objective methodology
is a promising tool in the automatic detection of perforators in CTA and can

realized by using ultracold atoms in optical lattices. To be specific, we
consider a 2D square lattice tight-binding model with an obliquely introduced
superlattice. It is demonstrated that quantized particle transport occurs in
this system, and that the transport is expressed as a solution of a Diophantine
equation. This topological nature can be understood by mapping the Hamiltonian
to a three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice model with a homogeneous magnetic
field. We also propose a continuum model with obliquely introduced superlattice
and obtain the amount of pumping by calculating the Berry curvature. For this
model, the same Diophantine equation can be derived from the plane-wave
approximation. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of a harmonic trap by
solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. Under a harmonic trap
potential, as often used in cold atom experiments, we show, by numerical
simulations, that nearly quantized pumping occurs when the phase of the
superlattice potential is driven at a moderate speed. Also, we find that two
regions appear, the Hofstadter region and the rectifying region, depending on
the modulation amplitude of the superlattice potential. In the rectifying
region with larger modulation amplitudes, we uncover that the pumping direction
is restricted to exactly the $x$-axis or the $y$-axis direction. This
difference in these two regions causes a crossover behavior, characterizing the
effect of the harmonic trap.

influence of the material source arrangement in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
system on the growth of nanowire (NW) core-shell structures. In particular, we
study the shell growth of GaN around GaN template NWs under the boundary
condition that Ga and N do not impinge on a given sidewall facet at the same
time. Our experiments with different V/III ratios and substrate temperatures
show that obtaining shells with homogeneous thickness along the whole NW length
is not straightforward. Analyzing in detail the shell morphology with and
without substrate rotation, we find that the different azimuthal angles of the
sources have a major impact on the Ga adatom kinetics and the final shell
morphology. On the basis of these experimental results, we develop a diffusion
model which takes into account different NW facets and the substrate. The model
allows to describe well the experimental shell profiles and predicts that
homogeneous shell growth can be achieved if the Ga and N source are arranged
next to each other or for very high rotation speeds. Moreover, the modeling
reveals that the growth on a given side facet can be categorized within one
rotation in four different phases: the Ga wetting phase, the metal-rich growth
phase, the N-rich growth phase, and the dissociation phase. The striking
difference to growth processes on planar samples is that, in our case,
diffusion takes place between different regions, i.e. the sidewall vs. the top
facet and substrate, out of which on one N impinges not continuously, resulting
in complex gradients in chemical potential that are modulated in time by
substrate rotation. The comprehensiveness of our model provides a deep
understanding of diffusion processes and the resulting adatom concentration,
and could be applied to other 3D structures and material systems

higher beam energy extends the sensitivity to gluon polarization down to \(x
\sim 0.02\). The high statistics of the data set and the small size of the
physics asymmetries, compared to the previous measurements at 200 GeV, required
the development of several new or improved analysis procedures in order to
minimize the systematic uncertainties. These include: the first implementation
by STAR of an underlying event subtraction during jet reconstruction, a much
improved technique to estimate the trigger and reconstruction bias effects, a
detailed optimization of the PYTHIA tune that provides a much better match
between the experimental data and simulated Monte Carlo events, and a new
procedure to estimate the uncertainties associated with the PYTHIA tune
parameters.
  The results for inclusive jet \(A_{LL}\) \textit{vs}.\@ jet \(p_T\) in 510

predictions from recent global analyses of the polarized PDFs that included
prior RHIC data in the fit. They are also consistent with the previous STAR

where the kinematics for the two beam energies overlap. These results will

$(1.4+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for Graph Path TSP, improving on a
recent $1.497$-approximation algorithm of Traub and Vygen.
  We obtain our results through a variety of new techniques, including a novel
way to set up a recursive dynamic program to guess significant parts of an
optimal solution. At the core of our dynamic program we deal with instances of
a new generalization of (Path) TSP which combines parity constraints with
certain connectivity requirements. This problem, which we call $\Phi$-TSP, has
a constant-factor approximation algorithm and can be reduced to TSP in certain
cases when the dynamic program would not make sufficient progress.

beyond the circle around the Sun where the number of catalogued open clusters
is thought to be statistically complete. By using deep optical photometry, we
estimated their ages and metallicities on the basis of a maximum likelihood
approach, using cluster members identified from Gaia DR2 data and likelihood
procedures. The studied clusters turned out to be of intermediate-age (0.8 -
4.0 Gyr), with metallicities spanning the range [Fe/H] ~ -0.5 - +0.1 dex, and
distributed within the general observed trend of the Milky Way disc radial and
perpendicular metallicity gradients. As far as we are aware, these are the
first metal abundance estimates derived for these clusters so far. From the
constructed stellar density radial profiles and cluster mass functions we
obtained a variety of structural and internal dynamics evolution parameters.
They show that while the innermost cluster regions would seem to be mainly
shaped according to the respective internal dynamics evolutionary stages, the
outermost ones would seem to be slightly more sensitive to the Milky Way tidal
field. The nearly coeval studied clusters are experiencing different levels of
two-body relaxation following star evaporation; those at more advanced stages
being more compact objects. Likewise, we found that the more important the
Milky way tides, the larger the Jacobi volume occupied by the clusters,
irrespective of their actual sizes and internal dynamics evolutionary stages.

can be extended functorially along any homomorphism $G \rightarrow H$ to an
automorphism of $H$. This leads naturally to a definition of ""inner
automorphism"" applicable to the objects of any category. Bergman and
Hofstra--Parker--Scott have computed these inner automorphisms for various
structures including $k$-algebras, monoids, lattices, unital rings, and
quandles---showing that, in each case, they are given by an obvious notion of
conjugation.
  In this note, we compute the inner automorphisms of groupoids, showing that
they are exactly the automorphisms induced by conjugation by a bisection. The
twist is that this result is false in the category of groupoids and
homomorphisms; to make it true, we must instead work with the less familiar
category of groupoids and comorphisms in the sense of Higgins and Mackenzie.
Besides our main result, we also discuss generalisations to topological and Lie
groupoids, to categories and to partial automorphisms, and examine the link
with the theory of inverse semigroups.

Bayesian optimization (BO) can be time-consuming and challenging. It is very
often the case that some roll-outs result in failure behaviors, causing
premature experiment detention. In such cases, the designer is forced to decide
on heuristic cost penalties because the acquired data is often scarce, or not
comparable with that of the stable policies. To overcome this, we propose a
Bayesian model that captures exactly what we know about the cost of unstable

somewhat large number. The resulting Bayesian model, approximated with a
Gaussian process, predicts high cost values in regions where failures are
likely to occur. In this way, the model guides the BO exploration toward
regions of stability. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model in
several illustrative and statistical synthetic benchmarks, and also in

that repeat-bursters may be compact objects undergoing violent tectonic

both strong ($B \gtrsim 10^{15}$ G) and highly multipolar, Hall drift can
instigate significant field rearrangements even on $\lesssim$ century long

the outer layers of the star, potentially strong enough to facilitate frequent
crustal failures. In this paper, assuming a quake scenario, we show how the
crustal field evolution, which determines the resulting fracture geometries,
can be tied to burst properties. Highly anisotropic stresses are generated by
the rapid evolution of multipolar fields, implying that small, localised cracks
can occur sporadically throughout the crust during the Hall evolution. Each of
these shallow fractures may release bursts of energy, consistent in magnitude
with those seen in the repeating sources FRB 121102 and FRB 180814.J0422+73.

in the literature both for the study of theoretical properties and as a model
for data fitting in empirical work. A major motivation for this interest is the
high degree of flexibility of the distribution as the parameters span their
admissible range, with ample variation of the associated measures of skewness
and kurtosis. While this high flexibility allows to adapt a member of the
parametric family to a wide range of data patterns, it also implies that
parameter estimation is a more delicate operation with respect to less flexible
parametric families, given that a small variation of the parameters can have a
substantial effect on the selected distribution. In this context, the aim of
the present contribution is to deal with some computational aspects of maximum
likelihood estimation. A problem of interest is the possible presence of
multiple local maxima of the log-likelihood function. Another one, to which
most of our attention is dedicated, is the development of a quick and reliable

significantly improve the performance of single image super-resolution (SISR).
Numerous studies have concentrated on raising the quantitative quality of
super-resolved (SR) images. However, these methods that target PSNR
maximization usually produce blurred images at large upscaling factor. The
introduction of generative adversarial networks (GANs) can mitigate this issue
and show impressive results with synthetic high-frequency textures.
Nevertheless, these GAN-based approaches always have a tendency to add fake
textures and even artifacts to make the SR image of visually higher-resolution.
In this paper, we propose a novel perceptual image super-resolution method that
progressively generates visually high-quality results by constructing a
stage-wise network. Specifically, the first phase concentrates on minimizing
pixel-wise error, and the second stage utilizes the features extracted by the
previous stage to pursue results with better structural retention. The final
stage employs fine structure features distilled by the second phase to produce
more realistic results. In this way, we can maintain the pixel, and structural
level information in the perceptual image as much as possible. It is useful to
note that the proposed method can build three types of images in a feed-forward
process. Also, we explore a new generator that adopts multi-scale hierarchical
features fusion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
approach is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

rigging. More expressive approaches like physical simulation have emerged, but
these methods are very difficult to tune, especially when simulating a real
actor's face. We propose to use a simple finite element simulation approach for
face animation, and present a novel method for recovering the required
simulation parameters in order to best match a real actor's face motion. Our
method involves reconstructing a very small number of head poses of the actor
in 3D, where the head poses span different configurations of force directions
due to gravity. Our algorithm can then automatically recover both the
gravity-free rest shape of the face as well as the spatially-varying physical
material stiffness such that a forward simulation will match the captured
targets as closely as possible. As a result, our system can produce
actor-specific, physical parameters that can be immediately used in recent
physical simulation methods for faces. Furthermore, as the simulation results

importance of non-canonical kinetic terms in novel types of inflationary
solutions. This motivates a thorough analysis of non-Gaussianities in this
context, which we revisit here by studying the primordial bispectrum in a
general two-field model. Our main result is the complete cubic action for
inflationary fluctuations written in comoving gauge, i.e. in terms of the
curvature perturbation and the entropic mode. Although full expressions for the
cubic action have already been derived in terms of fields fluctuations in the
flat gauge, their applicability is mostly restricted to numerical evaluations.
Our form of the action is instead amenable to several analytical
approximations, as our calculation in terms of the directly observable quantity
makes manifest the scaling of every operator in terms of the slow-roll
parameters, what is essentially a generalization of Maldacena's single-field
result to non-canonical two-field models. As an important application we derive
the single-field effective field theory that is valid when the entropic mode is
heavy and may be integrated out, underlining the observable effects that derive
from a curved field space.

cascade of wave energy requires counter-propagating Alfv\'enic wave-packets,
along some mean magnetic field. This fact is an obvious outcome of the MHD
equations under the assumptions of incompressibility and homogeneity. Despite
attempts to relax these assumptions in the context of MHD turbulence, the
central idea of turbulence generation persists. However, once the assumptions
of incompressiblity and homogeneity break down, the generally accepted picture
of turbulent cascade generation is not universal. In this paper, we show that
perpendicular inhomogeneities (across the mean magnetic field) lead to
propagating wave solutions which are necessarily described by co-propagating
Els\""asser fields, already in the incompressible case. One simple example of
these wave solutions is the surface Alfv\'en wave on a planar discontinuity
across the magnetic field. We show through numerical simulations how the
nonlinear self-deformation of these unidirectionally propagating waves leads to
a cascade of wave energy across the magnetic field. The existence of this type
of unidirectional cascade might have an additional strong effect on the
turbulent dissipation rate of dominantly outward propagating Alfv\'enic waves
in structured plasma, as in the solar corona and solar wind.

sales growth of an E-Commerce (E-Com) platform. Traditional Learning to Rank
(LTR) algorithms require relevance judgments on products. In E-Com, getting
such judgments poses an immense challenge. In the literature, it is proposed to
employ user feedback (such as clicks, add-to-basket (AtB) clicks and orders) to
generate relevance judgments. It is done in two steps: first, query-product
pair data are aggregated from the logs and then order rate etc are calculated
for each pair in the logs. In this paper, we advocate counterfactual risk
minimization (CRM) approach which circumvents the need of relevance judgements,
data aggregation and is better suited for learning from logged data, i.e.
contextual bandit feedback. Due to unavailability of public E-Com LTR dataset,
we provide \textit{Mercateo dataset} from our platform. It contains more than
10 million AtB click logs and 1 million order logs from a catalogue of about
3.5 million products associated with 3060 queries. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work which examines effectiveness of CRM approach
in learning ranking model from real-world logged data. Our empirical evaluation
shows that our CRM approach learns effectively from logged data and beats a
strong baseline ranker ($\lambda$-MART) by a huge margin. Our method
outperforms full-information loss (e.g. cross-entropy) on various deep neural
network models. These findings demonstrate that by adopting CRM approach, E-Com
platforms can get better product search quality compared to full-information

process. In existing works, two categories of constraints have been widely
explored, namely pairwise and cardinality constraints. Pairwise constraints
enforce the cluster labels of two instances to be the same (must-link
constraints) or different (cannot-link constraints). Cardinality constraints
encourage cluster sizes to satisfy a user-specified distribution. Most existing
constrained clustering models can only utilize one category of constraints at a
time. We enforce the above two categories into a unified clustering model
starting with the integer program formulation of the standard K-means. As the
two categories provide different useful information, utilizing both allow for
better clustering performance. However, the optimization is difficult due to
the binary and quadratic constraints in the unified formulation. To solve this,
we utilize two techniques: equivalently replacing the binary constraints by the
intersection of two continuous constraints; the other is transforming the
quadratic constraints into bi-linear constraints by introducing extra
variables. We derive an equivalent continuous reformulation with simple
constraints, which can be efficiently solved by Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate
when: (1) utilizing a single category of constraint, the proposed model is
superior to or competitive with SOTA constrained clustering models, and (2)
utilizing both categories of constraints jointly, the proposed model shows
better performance than the case of the single category. The experiments show
that the proposed method exploits the constraints to achieve perfect clustering
performance with improved clustering to 2%-5% in classical clustering metrics,
e.g. Adjusted Random, Mirkin's, and Huber's, indices outerperfomring other

of such constraints on the performance of a robot. Thus, we revise the
specification by iteratively presenting users with alternative solutions where
some constraints might be violated, and learn about the importance of the
constraints from the users' choices between these alternatives. We demonstrate
our framework in a user study with a material transport task in an industrial
facility. We show that nearly all users accept alternative solutions and thus
obtain a revised specification through the learning process, and that the
revision leads to a substantial improvement in robot performance. Further, the
learning process reduces the variances between the specifications from
different users and, thus, makes the specifications more similar. As a result,
the users whose initial specifications had the largest impact on performance
benefit the most from the interactive learning.

experimental conditions at FEL sources to minimize space charge effects and
radiation damage. We investigate a bilayer pentacene film on Ag(110) by optical
laser pump and FEL probe experiments. From the momentum microscopy signal, we
obtain time-dependent momentum maps of the excited-state dynamics of both
pentacene layers separately. Combining experimental observations with a
theoretical study, we interpret the observed signal for the bottom layer as
resulting from the charge redistribution between the molecule and the substrate
induced by excitation. We identify that the dynamics of the top pentacene layer
resembles excited-state molecular dynamics.

several machine learning algorithms, namely Isolation Forest, Histogram Based

using Kibana and are assigned an outlier score, which serves as an indicator

In the incommensurate case we calculate the phase diagram of the model in
several regions. We characterize the phases by calculating the mean inverse
participation ratio and perform multi-fractal analysis. In addition, we
characterize whether the phases found are topologically trivial or not. We find
an interesting critical extended phase when incommensurate hopping modulation
is present. The rise between the inverse participation ratio in regions
separating localized and extended states is gradual, rather than sharp. When,
in addition, the on-site potential modulation is incommensurate, we find
several sharp rises and falls in the inverse participation ratio. In these two
cases all different phases exhibit topological edge states. For the

problems faster than Classic Computers. This phenomenon is called ""quantum
advantage"" (or a stronger term ""quantum supremacy"").
  Quantum advantage will help us to speed up computations in many areas, from
artificial intelligence to medicine. However, QC power can also be leveraged to
break modern cryptographic algorithms, which pervade modern software: use cases
range from encryption of Internet traffic, to encryption of disks, to signing
blockchain ledgers.
  While the exact date when QCs will evolve to reach quantum advantage is
unknown, the consensus is that this future is near. Thus, in order to maintain
crypto agility of the software, one needs to start preparing for the era of
quantum advantage proactively.
  In this paper, we recap the effect of quantum advantage on the existing and
new software systems, as well as the data that we currently store. We also
highlight similarities and differences between the security challenges brought
by QCs and the challenges that software engineers faced twenty years ago while
fixing widespread Y2K bug. Technically, the Y2K bug and the quantum advantage
problems are different: the former was caused by timing-related problems, while
the latter is caused by a cryptographic algorithm being non-quantum-resistant.
However, conceptually, the problems are similar: we know what the root cause
is, the fix (strategically) is straightforward, yet the implementation of the
fix is challenging.
  To address the quantum advantage challenge, we create a seven-step roadmap,
deemed 7E. It is inspired by the lessons-learnt from the Y2K era amalgamated
with modern knowledge. The roadmap gives developers a structured way to start
preparing for the quantum advantage era, helping them to start planning for the
creation of new as well as the evolution of the existent software.

Ties in the preferences allow for three different definitions for a stable
matching: weak, strong and super-stability. Besides this, acceptable pairs in
the instance can be restricted in their ability of blocking a matching or being

Tuscany Region, aiming at detecting and estimating rainfall fields from the
opportunistic use of the rain-induced excess attenuation incurred in the
downlink channel by a commercial DVB satellite signal. The attenuation is
estimated by reverse-engineering the effects of the various propagation
phenomena affecting the received signal, among which, in first place, the
perturbations factors affecting geostationary orbits, such as the gravitational
attraction from the moon and the sun and the inhomogeneity in Earth mass
distribution and, secondly, the small-scale irregularities in the atmospheric
refractive index, causing rapid fluctuations in signal amplitude. The latter
impairments, in particular, even if periodically counteracted by correction
maneuvers, may give rise to significant departures of the actual satellite
position from the nominal orbit. A further problem to deal with is the daily
and seasonal random fluctuation of the rain height and altitude/size of the
associated melting layer. All of the above issues lead to non-negligible random
deviations from the dry nominal downlink attenuation, that can be
misinterpreted as rain events. In this paper we show how to counteract these
issues by employing two differentially-configured Kalman filters designed to
track slow and fast changes of the received signal-to-noise ratio, so that the
rain events can be reliably detected and the relevant rainfall rate estimated.

registration during overlay of the planning on intra-operative X-ray images.
Performing these steps manually however is prone to intra-rater/inter-rater

We evaluate it on the example of femoral drill site planning for medial
patellofemoral ligament reconstruction surgery. A deep multi-task stacked
hourglass network is trained on 149 conventional lateral X-ray images to
jointly localize two femoral landmarks, to predict a region of interest for the
posterior femoral cortex tangent line, and to perform semantic segmentation of
the femur, patella, tibia, and fibula with adaptive task complexity weighting.
On 38 clinical test images the framework achieves a median localization error
of 1.50 mm for the femoral drill site and mean IOU scores of 0.99, 0.97, 0.98,
and 0.96 for the femur, patella, tibia, and fibula respectively. The
demonstrated approach consistently performs surgical planning at expert-level

traditional ground\&solve approach and are general-purpose implementations,

the input program are compiled into an ad-hoc evaluation algorithm (i.e., we
obtain a specific binary for a given program), and might not be subject to the
grounding step. To this end, we identify a condition that allows the
compilation of a sub-program, and present the related partial compilation
technique. Importantly, we have implemented the new approach on top of a
well-known ASP solver and conducted an experimental analysis on
publicly-available benchmarks. Results show that our compilation-based approach
improves on the state of the art in various scenarios, including cases in which
the input program is stratified or the grounding blow-up makes the evaluation
unpractical with traditional ASP systems.

quantum critical point (QCP), have posed a long-standing mystery. The frequent
association of strange metals with unconventional superconductivity and
antiferromagnetic QCPs has led to a belief that they are highly entangled
quantum states. Ferromagnets, by contrast are regarded as an unlikely setting
for strange metals, for they are weakly entangled and their QCPs are often
interrupted by competing phases or first order phase transitions. Here, we
provide compelling evidence that the stoichiometric heavy fermion ferromagnet
CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ becomes a strange metal at a pressure-induced QCP: specific heat
and resistivity measurements demonstrate that the FM transition is continuously
suppressed to zero temperature revealing a strange metal phase. We argue that
strong magnetic anisotropy plays a key role in this process,injecting
entanglement, in the form of triplet resonating valence bonds (tRVBs) into the
ordered ferromagnet. We show that the singular transformation from tRVBs into
Kondo singlets that occurs at the QCP causes a jump in the Fermi surface
volume: a key driver of strange metallic behavior. Our results open up a new
direction for research into FM quantum criticality, while also establishing an
important new setting for the strange metal problem. Most importantly, strange
metallic behavior at a FM quantum critical point suggests that it is quantum
entanglement rather than the destruction of antiferromagnetism that is the
common driver of the many varied examples of strange metallic behavior.

crystal structure. In contrast to earlier studies, we find that the
nearest-neighbor coupling $J_1$ may be negligibly small, owing to a nearly
perfect compensation of the ferromagnetic direct exchange and antiferromagnetic
superexchange. Under this condition, weak symmetric anisotropy of the exchange
couplings gives rise to the UUDD order observed experimentally and also
elucidates the non-trivial ordering pattern between the layers, whereas a small
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction causes a spin canting that may generate local
electric polarization. We argue that the buckling of the copper chains plays a

Galactic open clusters (OCs) has become a field of increasing interest,
particularly to the light of the general knowledge that MPs are observed in
relatively massive clusters (>= 5 10^4 Mo). I report here measurements of
stellar parameters and abundances of 17 different chemical species, including
light and iron-peak elements of the old open cluster NGC188, from the APOGEE
DR14 database. I selected 15 bonafide cluster red giants that reveal an spread
in [Na/Fe] of +-0.16 dex, caused by two different groups of measurements whose
mean [Na/Fe] values differ by ~ 0.30 dex. A hint for a subtle anti-correlation
with Al and TiII, which also show relative large [X/Fe] dispersions, is also
seen in the data. However, [Na/Fe] abundances have been found to be typically
affected by uncertainties of 0.16 dex. Furthermore, I directly compared the
available spectra for stars with similar atmospheric parameters and it would
seem that they look similar. Therefore, I warn users of large spectroscopic
surveys to be extra careful when finding peculiar abundance results. Analysis
pipelines that run in an unsupervised fashion may produce bad results which may
not be noticed before publication.

variational-inference method which achieves a tighter evidence bound (and hence
a lower bias) than standard variational autoencoders by optimising a
multi-sample objective, i.e. an objective that is expressible as an integral
over $K > 1$ Monte Carlo samples. Unfortunately, IWAE crucially relies on the
availability of reparametrisations and even if these exist, the multi-sample
objective leads to inference-network gradients which break down as $K$ is
increased (Rainforth et al., 2018). This breakdown can only be circumvented by
removing high-variance score-function terms, either by heuristically ignoring
them (which yields the 'sticking-the-landing' IWAE (IWAE-STL) gradient from
Roeder et al. (2017)) or through an identity from Tucker et al. (2019) (which
yields the 'doubly-reparametrised' IWAE (IWAE-DREG) gradient). In this work, we
argue that directly optimising the proposal distribution in importance sampling
as in the reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) algorithm from Bornschein & Bengio (2015)
is preferable to optimising IWAE-type multi-sample objectives. To formalise
this argument, we introduce an adaptive-importance sampling framework termed
adaptive importance sampling for learning (AISLE) which slightly generalises
the RWS algorithm. We then show that AISLE admits IWAE-STL and IWAE-DREG (i.e.
the IWAE-gradients which avoid breakdown) as special cases.

progress dealing with squared or irregular holes. However, they fail to
generate plausible textures inside damaged area because there lacks surrounding

eliminating central blurriness, i.e., restoring well and then updating masks.
In this paper, we propose full-resolution residual network (FRRN) to fill
irregular holes, which is proved to be effective for progressive image
inpainting. We show that well-designed residual architecture facilitates
feature integration and texture prediction. Additionally, to guarantee
completion quality during progressive inpainting, we adopt N Blocks, One
Dilation strategy, which assigns several residual blocks for one dilation step.
Correspondingly, a step loss function is applied to improve the performance of
intermediate restorations. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed FRRN framework for image inpainting is much better than previous

has formed and evolved and to its dark matter halo. Local extremely metal-poor
galaxies (XMPs; defined as having an average gas-phase metallicity < 0.1 solar)
are important objects for understanding galaxy evolution largely because they
appear to be caught in the act of accreting gas from the cosmic web, and their
3-D shape may reflect this. Here we report on the 3-D shape of XMPs as inferred
from their observed projected minor-to-major axial ratios using a hierarchical
Bayesian inference model, which determines the likely shape and orientation of
each galaxy while simultaneously inferring the average shape and dispersion. We
selected a sample of 149 XMPs and divided it into three sub-samples according
to physical size and found that (1) the stellar component of XMPs of all sizes
tends to be triaxial, with an intermediate axis approx 0.7 times the longest
axis and that (2) smaller XMPs tend to be relatively thicker, with the shortest
axis going from approx 0.15 times the longest axis for the large galaxies to
approx 0.4 for the small galaxies. We provide the inferred 3-D shape and
inclination of the individual XMPs in electronic format. We show that our
results for the intermediate axis are not clouded by a selection effect against
face-on XMPs. We discuss how an intermediate axis significantly smaller than
the longest axis may be produced by several mechanisms, including lopsided gas
accretion, non-axisymmetric star formation, or coupling with an elongated dark
matter halo. Large relative thickness may reflect slow rotation, stellar
feedback, or recent gas accretion.

extended asphericity. The asymmetries are not confined to the helium core, but
reach out to a significant part of the outer hydrogen envelope, hence clearly
indicating a marked intrinsic diversity in the aspherical structure of CC
explosions. These observations provide new constraints on the explosion

enough such that they can exchange mass and/or energy. They are subdivided into

in the context of close binary stars, is their classification into these
subclasses, based solely on their light curves. Conventionally, this is done by
observing subtle features in the light curves like the depths of adjacent

suggest the use of machine learning algorithms applied to measures of

confined to a circular trap in contact with a thermal reservoir are
investigated. The vibrational amplitudes and energies are assumed to be
quantized, with the motions corresponding roughly to certain modes for ringlike
or tetrahedral molecules (such as benzene or methane, respectively). The
calculation of the partition function requires integrations over the internal
phases describing the oscillations, as well as the disks' center-of-mass
positions and momenta; while an exact result is obtained for a single disk, for
two disks the position-space integration can only be approximated. In spite of
the small number of disks considered, various ""thermodynamic"" quantities are
evaluated from the partition function. It is found that the average energy of
the system is increased---compared to that for rigid disks---as are the entropy
and compressibility; the pressure, however, is decreased, and there is a
variable effect on the heat capacity, depending on the ratio of the vibrational
energy to the temperature. These changes can be traced either directly or
indirectly to the oscillations causing an effective increase in the area
available to the molecules within the circle, which in turn leads to an
increase in the size of the accessible phase space, with the increase being
larger for higher energy states.

is a subject of fundamental interest to ocean, coastal and harbor engineers.
The specific bathymetry considered in this paper consists of one or two,
naturally formed or man-made, trenches. The problem we focus on is the
transformation of an incoming solitary wave by the trench(es), and the impact
of the resulting wave system on a vertical wall located after the trench(es).
The maximum run-up and the maximum force exerted on the wall are calculated for
various lengths and heights of the trench(es), and are compared with the
corresponding quantities in the absence of them. The calculations have been
performed by using the fully nonlinear water-wave equations, in the form of the
Hamiltonian coupled-mode theory, recently developed in Papoutsellis et al (Eur.
J. Mech. B/Fluids, Vol. 72, 2018, pp. 199-224). Comparisons of the calculated
free-surface elevation with existing experimental results indicate that the
effect of the vortical flow, inevitably developed within and near the
trench(es) but not captured by any potential theory, is not important
concerning the frontal wave flow regime. This suggests that the predictions of
the run-up and the force on the wall by nonlinear potential theory are expected
to be nearly realistic. The main conclusion of our investigation is that the
presence of two tandem trenches in front of the wall may reduce the run-up from
(about) 20% to 45% and the force from 15% to 38%, depending on the trench
dimensions and the wave amplitude. The percentage reduction is greater for
higher waves. The presence of only one trench leads to reductions 1.4 - 1.7
times smaller.

device is the only means of deflecting large Potentially Hazardous Asteroids
(PHAs) away from an Earth-impacting trajectory. The Enhanced Kinetic Impactor
(EKI) concept is proposed to deflect large PHAs via maneuvering space rocks.
First, an unmanned spacecraft is launched to rendezvous with an intermediate
Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA). Then, more than one hundred tons of rocks are
collected from the NEA as the EKI. The NEA can also be captured as the EKI if
the NEA is very small. Finally, the EKI is maneuvered to impact the PHA at a
high speed, resulting in a significant deflection of the PHA. For example, to
deflect Apophis, as much as 200 t of rocks could be collected from a NEA as the
EKI based on existing engineering capabilities. The EKI can produce a velocity
increment (delta-v) of 39.81 mm/s in Apophis, thereby increasing the minimum
geocentric distance during the close encounter in 2029 by 1,866.93 km. This
mission can be completed in 3.96 years with a propellant cost of 2.98 t.
Compared with a classic kinetic impactor, the deflection distance can be
increased one order of magnitude. The EKI concept breaks through the limitation
of the ground-based launch capability, which can significantly increase the
mass of the impactor. We anticipate that our research will be a starting point
for efficient planetary defense against large PHAs.

new unsupervised learning techniques to simultaneously cluster rows and columns

learning and in many applications, e.g. to computational biology and
bioinformatics. The H-score is the evaluation score underlying the seminal
biclustering algorithm by Cheng and Church, as well as many other subsequent
biclustering methods. In this paper, we characterize a potentially troublesome
bias in this score, that can distort biclustering results. We prove, both
analytically and by simulation, that the average H-score increases with the
number of rows/columns in a bicluster. This makes the H-score, and hence all
algorithms based on it, biased towards small clusters. Based on our analytical
proof, we are able to provide a straightforward way to correct this bias,
allowing users to accurately compare biclusters.

destination in a secret manner. This is done by embedding messages/text/data
into images without impacting the appearance of the resultant images/videos.
Steganalysis is the science of determining if an image has secret messages
embedded/hidden in it. Because there are numerous steganography algorithms, and
since each one of them requires a different type of steganalysis, the
steganalysis process is extremely challenging. Thus, researchers aim to develop
one universal steganalysis to detect all known and unknown steganography
algorithms, ideally in real-time. Universal steganalysis extracts a large
number of features to distinguish stego images from cover images. However, the
increase in features leads to the problem of the curse of dimensionality (CoD),
which is considered to be an NP-hard problem. This COD problem additionally
makes real-time steganalysis hard. A large number of features generates large
datasets for which machine learning cannot generate an optimal model.
Generating a machine learning based model also takes a long time which makes
real-time processing appear impossible in any optimization for time-intensive
fields such as visual computing. Possible solutions for CoD are deep learning
and evolutionary algorithms that overcome the machine learning limitations. In
this study, we investigate previously developed evolutionary algorithms for

craters in a spherical square over the surface of it. As it is well known,
approximate values for $\pi $ can be obtained by counting random numbers in a
square and in a quarter of circle inscribed in it in Euclidean geometry. This
procedure can be extend it to spherical geometry, where new relations between
the areas of a spherical square and the quarter of circle inscribed in it are
obtained. When the radius of the sphere is larger than the radius of the
quarter of circle, Euclidean geometry is recovered and the ratio of the areas
tends to $\pi $. Using these results, theoretical deviations of $\pi $ due to
the Moon radius $R$ are computed. In order to obtain this deviation, a
spherical square is selected located in a great circle of the Moon. The random
points over the spherical square are given by a specific zone of the Moon where
craters are distributed almost randomly. Computing the ratio of the areas, the
deviation of $\pi $ allows us to obtain the Moon radius with an intrinsic error
given by the finite number of random craters.

existing structured information, which embodies our knowledge such as entity or

Given a gigantic collection of texts which offers rich semantic information, it
is also important to harness the massiveness of the unannotated text corpus to
expand and refine existing structured knowledge with fewer annotation efforts.
  In this dissertation, I will introduce principles, models, and algorithms for

generally interested in obtaining insights and better understanding

embeds nodes under a personalized PageRank based propagation scheme, separately
for group-user graph and user-item graph. Node embeddings from each graph are
integrated using an attention mechanism. We evaluate our HGP on a large-scale

positions of the center of pressure. The raw two-dimensional signals were
sliced into segments of two gait cycles. A set of 20,250 segments from 30

The best CNN classified a separate set containing 2,250 segments with 99.9%
overall accuracy. A second set of 4,500 segments from the six remaining
subjects was then used for transfer learning. Several small subsamples of this
set were selected randomly and used for fine tuning. Training with two segments
per subject was sufficient to achieve 100% accuracy. The results suggest that
every person produces a unique trajectory of underfoot pressures and that CNNs
can learn the distinctive features of these trajectories. Using transfer
learning, a few strides could be sufficient to learn and identify new gaits.

avoiding computational and memory restrictions associated with large-scale
environmental data science applications. The evaluation of the Gaussian
log-likelihood function requires O(n^2) storage and O(n^3) operations where n
is the number of geographical locations. Thus, computing the log-likelihood
function with a large number of locations requires exploiting the power of
existing parallel computing hardware systems, such as shared-memory, possibly
equipped with GPUs, and distributed-memory systems, to solve this computational
complexity. In this paper, we advocate the use of ExaGeoStatR, a package for
exascale Geostatistics in R that supports a parallel computation of the exact
maximum likelihood function on a wide variety of parallel architectures.
Parallelization in ExaGeoStatR depends on breaking down the numerical linear
algebra operations in the log-likelihood function into a set of tasks and
rendering them for a task-based programming model. The package can be used
directly through the R environment on parallel systems. Currently, ExaGeoStatR
supports several maximum likelihood computation variants such as exact,
Diagonal Super Tile (DST), Tile Low-Rank (TLR) approximations, and
Mixed-Precision (MP). ExaGeoStatR also provides a tool to simulate large-scale
synthetic datasets. These datasets can help to assess different implementations
of the maximum log-likelihood approximation methods. Here, we demonstrate
ExaGeoStatR by illustrating its implementation details, analyzing its
performance on various parallel architectures, and assessing its accuracy using
synthetic datasets with up to 250K observations. We provide a hands-on tutorial
to analyze a sea surface temperature real dataset. The performance evaluation
involves comparisons with the popular packages geoR and fields for exact
likelihood evaluation.

compete with each other to bid for a limited number of channels across the

MUs. We model the interactions among the non-cooperative SPs as a stochastic
game, in which the objective of a SP is to optimize its own expected long-term

construct an abstract stochastic game using the channel auction outcomes. Then
we linearly decompose the per-SP Markov decision process to simplify the
decision-makings and derive a deep reinforcement learning based scheme to
approach the optimal abstract control policies. TensorFlow-based experiments
verify that the proposed scheme outperforms the three baselines and yields the
best performance in average utility per MU per scheduling slot.
