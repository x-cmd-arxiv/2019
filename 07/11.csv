degree distribution's similarity to a power law. However, many heavy-tailed
networks in real life do not have power-law degree distributions, and in many
applications the scale-free nature of the network is irrelevant so long as the
network possesses hubs. Here we present the Cooke-Nieboer index (CNI), a
non-asymptotic measure of the heavy-tailedness of a network's degree

calculate, and clearly distinguishes between networks with power-law,
exponential, and symmetric degree distributions.

latent-variable models, such that the model's marginal distribution over

further, and want to approximate the true joint distribution over observed and
latent variables, including the true prior and posterior distributions over
latent variables. This is known to be generally impossible due to
unidentifiability of the model. We address this issue by showing that for a
broad family of deep latent-variable models, identification of the true joint
distribution over observed and latent variables is actually possible up to very
simple transformations, thus achieving a principled and powerful form of
disentanglement. Our result requires a factorized prior distribution over the
latent variables that is conditioned on an additionally observed variable, such
as a class label or almost any other observation. We build on recent
developments in nonlinear ICA, which we extend to the case with noisy,
undercomplete or discrete observations, integrated in a maximum likelihood
framework. The result also trivially contains identifiable flow-based
generative models as a special case.

itself by some toxic compound and the parasite, in turn, responds by producing
an enzyme that inactivates that compound. In some cases, the host can respond
by producing an inhibitor of that enzyme, which can be considered as a
counter-counter defence. An example is provided by cephalosporins,
beta-lactamases and clavulanic acid (an inhibitor of beta-lactamases). Here, we
tackle the question under which conditions it pays, during evolution, to
establish a counter-counter defence rather than to intensify or widen the
defence mechanisms. We establish a mathematical model describing this
phenomenon, based on enzyme kinetics for competitive inhibition. We use an
objective function based on Haber's rule, which says that the toxic effect is
proportional to the time integral of toxin concentration. The optimal
allocation of defence and counter-counter defence can be calculated in an
analytical way despite the nonlinearity in the underlying differential
equation. The calculation provides a threshold value for the dissociation
constant of the inhibitor. Only if the inhibition constant is below that
threshold, that is, in the case of strong binding of the inhibitor, it pays to
have a counter-counter defence. This theoretical prediction accounts for the
observation that not for all defence mechanisms, a counter-counter defence
exists. Our results should be of interest for computing optimal mixtures of
beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam, as
well as for plant-herbivore and other molecular-ecological interactions and to
fight antibiotic resistance in general.

job size (i.e., the time it takes to run them), can perform very desirably in
terms of both response time and fairness. Unfortunately, the requirement of
knowing a priori the exact job size is a major obstacle which is frequently
insurmountable in practice. Often, it is possible to get a coarse estimation of
job size, but unfortunately analytical results with inexact job sizes are
challenging to obtain, and simulation-based studies show that several
size-based algorithm are severely impacted by job estimation errors. For
example, Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT), which yields optimal mean
sojourn time when job sizes are known exactly, can drastically underperform
when it is fed inexact job sizes.
  Some algorithms have been proposed to better handle size estimation errors,
but they are somewhat complex and this makes their analysis challenging. We
consider Shortest Processing Time (SPT), a simplification of SRPT that skips
the update of ""remaining"" job size and results in a preemptive algorithm that
simply schedules the job with the shortest estimated processing time. When job
size is inexact, SPT performs comparably to the best known algorithms in the
presence of errors, while being definitely simpler. In this work, SPT is
evaluated through simulation, showing near-optimal performance in many cases,
with the hope that its simplicity can open the way to analytical evaluation
even when inexact inputs are considered.

channel estimation approach is extremely vital for channel detection and signal

additional challenges to obtaining real-time channel measurements. Deep
learning (DL) techniques, in this context, offer learning ability and
optimization capability that can approximate many kinds of functions. In this
paper, we develop a DL-based channel prediction method to estimate channel
responses for V2I communications. We have demonstrated how fast neural networks
can learn V2I channel properties and the changing trend. The network is trained
with a series of channel responses and known pilots, which then speculates the
next channel response based on the acquired knowledge. The predicted channel is
then used to evaluate the system performance.

unexpected hypersurfaces. Unexpected hypersurfaces occur when the actual
dimension of the space of forms satisfying certain vanishing data is positive
and the imposed vanishing conditions are not independent. The first instance
studied were unexpected curves in the paper by Cook II, Harbourne, Migliore,
Nagel. Unexpected hypersurfaces were then investigated by Bauer, Malara, Szpond
and Szemberg, followed by Harbourne, Migliore, Nagel and Teitler who introduced
the notion of BMSS duality and showed it holds in some cases (such as certain
plane curves and, in higher dimensions, for certain cones). They ask to what
extent such a duality holds in general. In this paper, working over a field of
characteristic zero, we study hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^n\times\mathbb{P}^n$
defined by determinants. We apply our results to unexpected hypersurfacesin the
case that the actual dimension is 1 (i.e., there is a unique unexpected
hypersurface). In this case, we show that a version of BMSS duality always
holds, as a consequence of fundamental properties of determinants.

registration based applications in biomedicine. Geodesic shooting has been
developed as one solution approach and formulates the diffeomorphic
registration as an optimal control problem under the Hamiltonian framework. In
this framework, with landmark positions q0 fixed, the problem solely depends on
the initial momentum p0 and evolves through time steps according to a set of
constraint equations. Given an initial p0, the algorithm flows q and p forward
through time steps, calculates a loss based on point-set mismatch and kinetic
energy, back-propagate through time to calculate gradient on p0 and update it.
In the forward and backward pass, a pair-wise kernel on landmark points K and
additional intermediate terms have to be calculated and marginalized, leading
to O(N2) computational complexity, N being the number of points to be
registered. For medical image applications, N maybe in the range of thousands,
rendering this operation computationally expensive. In this work we ropose a

or vertex-reinforced random walks is significantly growing in recent years as
they are much better at modeling high dimensional data and nonlinear dynamics
in numerous application settings. In many cases of practical interest, these
processes are identified with a stochastic tensor and their stationary
distribution is a tensor $Z$-eigenvector. However, fundamental questions such
as the convergence of the process towards a limiting distribution and the
uniqueness of such a limit are still not well understood and are the subject of
rich recent literature. Ergodicity coefficients for stochastic matrices provide
a valuable and widely used tool to analyze the long-term behavior of standard,
first-order, Markov processes. In this work, we extend an important class of
ergodicity coefficients to the setting of stochastic tensors. We show that the
proposed higher-order ergodicity coefficients provide new explicit formulas
that (a) guarantee the uniqueness of Perron $Z$-eigenvectors of stochastic
tensors, (b) provide bounds on the sensitivity of such eigenvectors with
respect to changes in the tensor and (c) ensure the convergence of different
types of higher-order stochastic processes governed by cubical stochastic
tensors. Moreover, we illustrate the advantages of the proposed ergodicity
coefficients on several example application settings, including the analysis of
PageRank vectors for triangle-based random walks and the convergence of lazy

entities. In complex settings where one does not directly measure a univariate
statistic upon which to base ranks, such inferences typically rely on
statistical models having entity-specific parameters. These can be treated as
random effects in hierarchical models characterizing variation among the
entities. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the problem of
ranking basketball players in terms of their contribution to team performance.
Using data from the United States National Basketball Association (NBA), we
find that many players have similar latent ability levels, making any single
estimated ranking highly misleading. The current literature fails to provide
summaries of order relationships that adequately account for uncertainty.
Motivated by this, we propose a Bayesian strategy for characterizing
uncertainty in inferences on order relationships among players and lineups. Our
approach adapts to scenarios in which uncertainty in ordering is high by
producing more conservative results that improve interpretability. This is
achieved through a reward function within a decision theoretic framework. We
apply our approach to data from the 2009-10 NBA season.

field has constant intensity, the oscillations generated by the stiff term are
periodic. The homogenized model is then derived and several state-of-the-art
multiscale methods, in combination with the Particle-In-Cell discretisation,
are proposed for solving the Vlasov-Poisson equation. Their accuracy as much as
their computational cost remain essentially independent of the strength of the
magnetic field. The proposed schemes thus allow large computational steps,
while the full gyro-motion can be restored by a linear interpolation in time.
In the linear case, extensions are introduced for general magnetic field
(varying intensity and direction). Eventually, numerical experiments are
exposed to illustrate the efficiency of the methods and some long-term

of state and tracking 49 elements. We study the disruption of a 1$M_\odot$ star
and 3$M_\odot$ star at zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), middle-age, and
terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). The maximum BH mass for tidal disruption
increases by a factor of $\sim$2 from stellar radius changes due to MS
evolution; this is equivalent to varying BH spin from 0 to 0.75. The shape of
the mass fallback rate curves is different from the results for polytropes of
Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz (2013). The peak timescale $t_{\rm peak}$ increases
with stellar age, while the peak fallback rate $\dot M_{\rm peak}$ decreases
with age, and these effects diminish with increasing impact parameter $\beta$.
For a $\beta=1$ disruption of a 1$M_\odot$ star by a $10^6 M_\odot$ BH, from
ZAMS to TAMS, $t_{\rm peak}$ increases from 30 to 54 days, while $\dot M_{\rm

nitrogen, helium, and carbon can occur before the peak timescale for
disruptions of MS stars, which is in contrast to predictions from the

times, meaning that compositional constraints can be key in determining the

largest enhancements in the models where reionization is extended or ends the
latest. On smaller scales ($k\gtrsim0.1$ s/km), we find that temperature
fluctuations suppress power by $\lesssim10\%$. We find that the shape of the

temperature fluctuations from reionization's patchiness. However, for all of
our models with reionization midpoints of $z\le 8$ ($z\le 12$) the shape
differences are $\lesssim20\%$ ($\lesssim40\%$) because of a surprisingly
well-matched cancellation between thermal broadening and pressure smoothing
that occurs for realistic thermal histories. We also consider fluctuations in
the ultraviolet background, finding their impact on the power spectrum to be
much smaller than temperature fluctuations at $k\gtrsim0.01$ s/km. Furthermore,
we compare our models to power spectrum measurements, finding that none of our

clusters as a function of the galactic environment. The model evaluates which
parts of a hierarchically-clustered star-forming region remain bound given the
time-scales for gravitational collapse, star formation, and stellar feedback.
We predict the initial cluster mass functions (ICMFs) for a variety of galaxies
and we show that these predictions are consistent with observations of the
solar neighbourhood and nearby galaxies, including the Large Magellanic Cloud
and M31. In these galaxies, the low minimum cluster mass of
$\sim10^2~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ is caused by sampling statistics, representing the
lowest mass at which massive (feedback-generating) stars are expected to form.
At the high gas density and shear found in the Milky Way's Central Molecular
Zone and the nucleus of M82, the model predicts that a mass
$>10^2~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ must collapse into a single cluster prior to
feedback-driven dispersal, resulting in narrow ICMFs with elevated
characteristic masses. We find that the minimum cluster mass is a sensitive
probe of star formation physics due to its steep dependence on the star
formation efficiency per free-fall time. Finally, we provide predictions for
globular cluster (GC) populations, finding a narrow ICMF for dwarf galaxy
progenitors at high redshift, which can explain the high specific frequency of
GCs at low metallicities observed in Local Group dwarfs like Fornax and WLM.
The predicted ICMFs in high-redshift galaxies constitute a critical test of the
model, ideally-suited for the upcoming generation of telescopes.

acceleration is observed in association with asymmetric neutrino emissions by
the time of $300$ms after bounce. We find that these asymmetric neutrino
emissions play important roles in the acceleration of PNS in this phase. The
correlation between the PNS proper motion and the asymmetric ejecta is similar
to that in the neutron star (NS) kick of hydrodynamic origin. Both
electron-type neutrinos ($\nu_{\rm e}$) and their anti-particles
($\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$) have $\sim 10\%$ level of asymmetry between the northern
and southern hemispheres, while other heavy-leptonic neutrinos ($\nu_x$) have
much smaller asymmetry of $\sim 1 \%$. The emissions of $\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$ and
$\nu_x$ are higher in the hemisphere of stronger shock expansion whereas the
$\nu_{\rm e}$ emission is enhanced in the opposite hemisphere: in total the
neutrinos carry some linear momentum to the hemisphere of the stronger shock
expansion. The asymmetry is attributed to the non-spherical distribution of
electron-fraction ($Y_e$) in the envelope of PNS. Although it is similar to
LESA (lepton-emission self-sustained asymmetry), the $Y_e$ asymmetry seems to
be associated with the PNS motion: the latter triggers lateral circular motions
in the envelope of PNS by breaking symmetry of the matter distribution there,
which are then sustained by a combination of convection, lateral neutrino
diffusion and matter-pressure gradient. Our findings may have an influence on
the current theories on the NS kick mechanism although long-term simulations
are required to assess their impact on the later evolution.

in agreement with local measurements of $H_{0}$ from type Ia supernovae
calibrated by the distance ladder, but in $3.1\sigma$ tension with $Planck$
observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is
completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination
of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in $5.3\sigma$
tension with $Planck$ CMB determinations of $H_{0}$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM. We
compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent
results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able
to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat $\Lambda$CDM using
constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with
other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from $Planck$, baryon
acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves
the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity.
Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with $Planck$.
Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type
Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our $H_0$ inference
to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our
combined inference on $H_{0}$ ranges from
$\sim73$-$78~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, which is consistent with the local

that computing minimal 1-dimensional persistent cycles (persistent 1-cycles)
for finite intervals is NP-hard while the same for infinite intervals is

dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients. In addition to proving that it is
NP-hard to compute minimal persistent d-cycles (d>1) for both types of
intervals given arbitrary simplicial complexes, we identify two interesting
cases which are polynomially tractable. These two cases assume the complex to
be a certain generalization of manifolds which we term as weak pseudomanifolds.
For finite intervals from the d-th persistence diagram of a weak

Since the same problem for infinite intervals is NP-hard, we further assume the
weak (d+1)-pseudomanifold to be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ so that the
complex has a natural dual graph structure and the problem reduces to a minimal

play an important dual role: they are responsible for generating
matter-antimatter asymmetry, but also provide time-dependent contributions to
the vacuum energy density of ""running-vacuum"" type, which drive the Universe
evolution. During the inflationary phase of a string-inspired Universe, and its
subsequent exit, the existence of primordial gravitational waves induce
gravitational anomalies, which couple to the Kalb-Ramond (KR)axion field of the
massless gravitational string multiplet. Such anomalous CP violating
interactions have two important effects: first, they lead to contributions to
the vacuum energy density of the form appearing in the ""running vacuum model""
(RVM) framework, proportional to both the square and the fourth power of the
effective Hubble parameter $H$, the $H^4$ terms being associated with
anomaly-induced inflation within the RVM framework. Second, there is an
undiluted KR axion at the end of inflation, which plays an important role in
generating matter-antimatter asymmetry through baryogenesis via leptogenesis in
models with heavy right handed neutrinos. As the Universe exits inflation and
enters a radiation dominated era, the generation of chiral fermionic matter is
responsible for the cancellation of gravitational anomalies, thus restoring
diffeomorphism invariance for the matter/radiation (quantum) theory, as
required for consistency. Chiral U(1) anomalies may remain uncompensated,
though, during matter/radiation dominance, providing RVM-like $H^2$ and $H^4$
contributions to the Universe energy density. Finally, in the current era,
gravitational anomalies resurface, leading to much weaker RVM-like $H_0^2$

alternative models of gravity have been developed to offer a geometric
explanation to the origin of such components. In this work we use the Minimal
Geometric Deformation approach to study extensions of the theory of General
Relativity in a cosmological context. This is possible since such approach
allows the decoupling of gravitational sources, and the Einstein field
equations can be analytically solved with the presence of a new gravitational
sector once a known GR solution is considered. In particular, we implement such
approach in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker and Kantowski-Sachs universes. We
demonstrate that the gravitational decoupling leads to modifications of well
known cosmological solutions. For instance, we show that an effective spatial
curvature in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, as well as several kind of
matter components in the Kantowski-Sachs case, are obtained. Thus, we found
that it is possible to obtain spatial curvature and new matter terms from
geometry, which in cosmology they could be useful in addressing problems such
as the spatial flatness of the Universe, dark matter and dark energy.

and there is broad interest in addressing gender disparities within astronomy.
Many studies of these topics have been performed by professional astronomers
who are relatively unfamiliar with research in fields such as gender studies
and sociology. As a result, they adopt a normative view of gender as a binary
choice of 'male' or 'female', leaving astronomers whose genders do not fit
within that model out of such research entirely. Reductive frameworks of gender
and an overemphasis on quantification as an indicator of gendered phenomena are
harmful to people of marginalized genders, especially those who live at the
intersections of multiple axes of marginalization such as race, disability, and
socioeconomic status. In order for the astronomy community to best serve its
marginalized members as we move into the next decade, a new paradigm must be
developed. This paper aims to address the future of gender equity in astronomy
by recommending better survey practices and institutional policies based on a
more complex approach to gender.

supported measure $\mu$ given finitely many of its coefficients $\hat{\mu}(k)$
with respect to some orthonormal system. The interesting case concerns
situations, where the number of coefficients required is substantially smaller
than a power of the reciprocal of the minimal separation among the points in
the support of $\mu$. In this paper, we consider the more severe problem of
recuperating $\mu$ approximately without any assumption on $\mu$ beyond having
a finite total variation. In particular, $\mu$ may be supported on a continuum,
so that the minimal separation among the points in the support of $\mu$ is $0$.
A variant of this problem is also of interest in machine learning as well as
the inverse problem of de-convolution. We define an appropriate notion of a
distance between the target measure and its recuperated version, give an
explicit expression for the recuperation operator, and estimate the distance
between $\mu$ and its approximation. We show that these estimates are the best
possible in many different ways. We also explain why for a finitely supported
measure the approximation quality of its recuperation is bounded from below if
the amount of information is smaller than what is demanded in the
super-resolution problem.

observations and geometrically verifying a large number of potential matches.
This poses severe challenges for small-size and low-cost robots with various
operational and resource constraints that limit, e.g., energy consumption,
communication bandwidth, and computation capacity. This paper proposes a
framework in which robots first exchange compact queries to identify a set of
potential loop closures. We then seek to select a subset of potential
inter-robot loop closures for geometric verification that maximizes a monotone
submodular performance metric without exceeding budgets on computation (number
of geometric verifications) and communication (amount of exchanged data for
geometric verification). We demonstrate that this problem is in general
NP-hard, and present efficient approximation algorithms with provable
performance guarantees. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated on real
and synthetic datasets. A natural convex relaxation scheme is also presented to
certify the near-optimal performance of the proposed framework in practice.

of well-connected nodes in all layers. We further propose normalization
technique to eliminate bias, and sampling algorithms for variance reduction.
Importantly, we can decouple the sampling from the forward and backward

radiation pressure and charge exchange on the Ly$\alpha$ absorption profile in
a hydrodynamical framework, and for a single set of stellar wind parameters
appropriate for HD 209458. We find that most of the absorption is produced by
the material from the planet, with a secondary contribution of neutralized
stellar ions by charge exchange. At the same time, the hydrodynamic shock heats
up the planetary material, resulting in a broad thermal profile. Meanwhile, the
radiation pressure yielded a small velocity shift of the absorbing material.
While neither charge exchange nor radiation pressure provide enough neutrals at

give a demonstration of our framework for three examples: (i) Kraichnan-Orszag
system, an illustrative coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, (ii)
Lorenz system exhibiting chaotic behavior, and (iii) a non-intrusive model
order reduction framework for the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations with a
differentially heated cavity flow setup at various Rayleigh numbers. Using only
snapshots of state variables at discrete time instances, our data-driven
approach can be considered truly non-intrusive, since any prior information
about the underlying governing equations is not required for generating the
reduced order model. Our \textit{a posteriori} analysis shows that the proposed
data-driven approach is remarkably accurate, and can be used as a robust
predictive tool for non-intrusive model order reduction of complex fluid flows.

been targeted at or near the spin frequency or double the spin frequency of
each pulsar, appropriate for mass quadrupole emission. But some neutron stars
might radiate strongly through current quadrupoles via $r$-modes, which
oscillate at about four thirds the spin frequency. We show for the first time
how to construct searches over appropriate ranges of frequencies and spin-down
parameters to target $r$-modes from known pulsars. We estimate computational

not only fundamental for studies as varied as classical electrodynamics and
polaritonics in condensed matter physics, but also for important applications
such as optical-force manipulations and photovoltaics. From a microscopic
perspective, an optical medium is in fact a complex system that can split the
light momentum into the electromagnetic field, as well as the material
electrons and the ionic lattice. Here, we disentangle the partition of momentum
associated with light propagation in optical media, and develop a quantum
theory to explicitly calculate its distribution. The material momentum here
revealed, which is distributed among electrons and ionic lattice, leads to the
prediction of unexpected phenomena. In particular, the electron momentum
manifests through an intrinsic DC current, and strikingly, we find that under
certain conditions this current can be along the photonic wave vector, implying
an optical pulling effect on the electrons. Likewise, an optical pulling effect
on the lattice can also be observed, such as in graphene during plasmon
propagation. We also predict the emergence of boundary electric dipoles
associated with light transmission through finite media, offering a microscopic
explanation of optical pressure on material boundaries.

automation, distributed generation integration and microgrid (MG) technology
development, etc., are empowering much more flexible reconfiguration and
operation of the system, e.g., DSs or MGs with flexible boundaries. However,
the formulation of DS reconfiguration-related optimization problems to include
those new flexibilities is non-trivial, especially for the issue of topology,
which has to be radial. That is, existing methods of formulating radiality
constraints can cause underutilization of DS flexibilities. Thus, this work
proposes a new method for radiality constraints formulation fully enabling the
topological and some other related flexibilities of DSs, so that the
reconfiguration-related optimization problems can have extended feasibility and
enhanced optimality. Graph-theoretic supports are provided to certify its
theoretical validity. As integer variables are involved, we also analyze the
tightness and compactness issues. The proposed radiality constraints are
specifically applied to post-disaster MG formation, which is involved in many
DS resilience-oriented service restoration and/or infrastructure recovery
problems. The resulting new MG formation model, which allows more flexible
merge and/or separation of sub-grids, etc., establishes superiority over the
models in the literature. Case studies are conducted on two test systems.

performance of PCC-KMC was evaluated using Lin's concordance correlation

precision were observed for absolute lesion height (bias=0.93, precision=0.94)
and absolute symptomatic area (bias=0.98, precision=0.97) studies. Moreover, we
introduced a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic annotation on
clusters, termed PCC-KMC-CNN. Our CNN was trained based on 85%:15% of
composition for training and testing dataset from total 168 ShB-infected stem
sample images, recording 92% accuracy and 0.21 loss. PCC-KMC-CNN also showed
high accuracy and precision for the absolute lesion height (bias=0.86,

observations in terms of an extended, magnetocentrifugally driven disk wind
that transports grains from the inner disk--where they are thermally processed
by the stellar radiation after being uplifted from the disk surfaces--to the
outer disk regions. For any disk radius $r$ there is a maximum grain size
$a_\mathrm{max}(r)$ that can be uplifted from that location: grains of size
$a$$\ll$$a_\mathrm{max}$ are carried away by the wind, whereas those with
$a$$\lesssim$$a_\mathrm{max}$ reenter the disk at larger radii. A significant
portion of the reentering grains converge to--and subsequently accumulate in--a
narrow region just beyond $r_\mathrm{max}(a)$, the maximum radius from which
grains of size $a$ can be uplifted. We show that this model can account for the
inferred crystallinity fractions in classical T Tauri and Herbig Ae disks and
for their indicated near constancy after being established early in the disk
evolution. It is also consistent with the reported radial gradients in the mean
grain size, crystallinity, and crystal composition. In addition, this model
yields the properties of the grains that remain embedded in the outflows from

reward functions for environments with the same (or similar) dynamical models.
We propose to learn a dynamical model during the training process and use this
model to perform sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks at test time. We use
significantly fewer samples by performing policy optimization only in a
""virtual"" environment whose transitions are given by our learned dynamical
model. Our algorithm sequentially trains against several tasks. Upon
encountering a new task, we first warm-up a policy on our learned dynamical
model, which requires no new samples from the environment. We then adapt the
dynamical model with samples from this policy in the real environment. We
evaluate our approach on several continuous control benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficacy over MAML, a state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithm, on these
tasks.

  Sequences through ReRAM technology",,,,,"q-bio.GN q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Genomics is the critical key to enabling precision medicine, ensuring global
food security and enforcing wildlife conservation. The massive genomic data
produced by various genome sequencing technologies presents a significant
challenge for genome analysis. Because of errors from sequencing machines and
genetic variations, approximate pattern matching (APM) is a must for practical
genome analysis. Recent work proposes FPGA, ASIC and even
process-in-memory-based accelerators to boost the APM throughput by
accelerating dynamic-programming-based algorithms (e.g., Smith-Waterman).
However, existing accelerators lack the efficient hardware acceleration for the
exact pattern matching (EPM) that is an even more critical and essential
function widely used in almost every step of genome analysis including
assembly, alignment, annotation and compression.
  State-of-the-art genome analysis adopts the FM-Index that augments the
space-efficient BWT with additional data structures permitting fast EPM
operations. But the FM-Index is notorious for poor spatial locality and massive
random memory accesses. In this paper, we propose a ReRAM-based
process-in-memory architecture, FindeR, to enhance the FM-Index EPM search
throughput in genomic sequences. We build a reliable and energy-efficient
Hamming distance unit to accelerate the computing kernel of FM-Index search
using commodity ReRAM chips without introducing extra CMOS logic. We further
architect a full-fledged FM-Index search pipeline and improve its search
throughput by lightweight scheduling on the NVDIMM. We also create a system
library for programmers to invoke FindeR to perform EPMs in genome analysis.
Compared to state-of-the-art accelerators, FindeR improves the FM-Index search
throughput by $83\%\sim 30K\times$ and throughput per Watt by $3.5\times\sim
42.5K\times$.

in $(0,\infty)\times \R^n$, where $n\geq 1$, $p>1$, $q\geq 1$ and $b>0$. First,
we focus our attention on positive solutions and obtain an optimal Fujita-type
result: any positive solution blows up in finite time if $p\leq 1+\frac{2}{n}$
or $q\leq 1+\frac{1}{n+1}$, while global classical positive solutions exist for
suitably small initial data when $p>1+\frac{2}{n}$ and $q> 1+\frac{1}{n+1}$.
Although finite time blow-up cannot be produced by the gradient term alone and
should be considered as an effect of the source term $|u|^p$, this result shows
that the gradient term induces an interesting phenomenon of discontinuity of
the critical Fujita exponent, jumping from $p=1+\frac{2}{n}$ to $p=\infty$ as
$q$ reaches the value $1+\frac{1}{n+1}$ from above. Next, we investigate the
case of sign-changing solutions and show that if $p\le 1+\frac{2}{n}$ or
$0<(q-1)(np-1)\le 1$, then the solution blows up in finite time for any
nontrivial initial data with nonnegative mean. Finally, a Fujita-type result,

of an agent (e.g., future trajectories of a pedestrian) is essential for
safety-critical perception systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles). In particular,
a set of possible future behaviors generated by the system must be diverse to
account for all possible outcomes in order to take necessary safety
precautions. It is not sufficient to maintain a set of the most likely future
outcomes because the set may only contain perturbations of a single outcome.
While generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been shown
to be a powerful tool for learning a distribution over future trajectories,
randomly drawn samples from the learned implicit likelihood model may not be
diverse -- the likelihood model is derived from the training data distribution
and the samples will concentrate around the major mode that has most data. In
this work, we propose to learn a diversity sampling function (DSF) that
generates a diverse and likely set of future trajectories. The DSF maps
forecasting context features to a set of latent codes which can be decoded by a
generative model (e.g., VAE) into a set of diverse trajectory samples.
Concretely, the process of identifying the diverse set of samples is posed as a
parameter estimation of the DSF. To learn the parameters of the DSF, the
diversity of the trajectory samples is evaluated by a diversity loss based on a
determinantal point process (DPP). Gradient descent is performed over the DSF
parameters, which in turn move the latent codes of the sample set to find an
optimal diverse and likely set of trajectories. Our method is a novel
application of DPPs to optimize a set of items (trajectories) in continuous
space. We demonstrate the diversity of the trajectories produced by our
approach on both low-dimensional 2D trajectory data and high-dimensional human
motion data.

CoRoT least 137 days. A nearly equidistant period spacing pattern are found
among 8 modes which are extracted from the oscillation spectrum with more than
500 frequencies. However, it is thought to be most likely accidental by
Szewczuk et al. (2014). In the present work, we analyze the 8 modes in depth
with the $\chi^2$-matching method. Based on the best fitting model (model MA),
we find that they can be well explained as a sequences of consecutive dipolar
$(l,~m)=(1,~0)$. The period discrepancies between observations and the best
fitting model are within 100 s except for the outlier which is up to 300 s.
Based on the calculated CMMs, we find that, for pure g-mode oscillations, the
buoyancy radius $\Lambda_{0}$ can be precisely measured with the
$\chi^2$-matching method between observations and calculations. It represents
the ""Propagation time"" of the g-mode from stellar surface to center. It is of
$\Lambda_{0}=245.78\pm0.59~\mu$Hz with a precision of 0.24\%. In addition, we
also find that HD 50230 is a metal-rich ($Z_{\rm init}=0.034-0.043$) star with
a mass of $M=6.15-6.27~{\rm M_{\odot}}$. It is still located on
hydrogen-burning phase with central hydrogen $X_{\rm C}=0.298-0.316$ (or

with a prior quiescent Chandra observation reported by Tsygankov et al. and has
an inferred blackbody radius of $\approx 10~\mathrm{km}$, consistent with
emission from the entire neutron star (NS) surface. There is also mild evidence
for an absorption line at $\approx 1~\mathrm{keV}$ and/or $\approx
1.4~\mathrm{keV}$. The hard component shows pulsations at $P \approx
31.908~\mathrm{s}$ (pulsed fraction $0.84 \pm 0.10$), agreeing with the pulse
period seen previously in outbursts, but no pulsations were found in the soft
excess (pulsed fraction $\lesssim 31\%$). We conclude that the pulsed hard
component suggests low-level accretion onto the neutron star poles, while the
soft excess seems to originate from the entire NS surface. We speculate that,
in quiescence, the source switches between a soft thermal-dominated state (when
the propeller effect is at work) and a relatively hard state with low-level
accretion, and use the propeller cutoff to estimate the magnetic field of the
system to be $\lesssim 8.4 \times 10^{11}~\mathrm{G}$. We compare the quiescent
thermal $L_X$ predicted by the standard deep crustal heating model to our

above the prediction for minimum cooling mechanisms. This suggests that RX
J0812.4-3114 either contains a relatively low-mass NS with minimum cooling, or
that the system may be young enough that the NS has not fully cooled from the

well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the two domains
are drawn from different data distributions. Because of the distribution
shifts, different target samples have distinct degrees of difficulty in
adaptation. However, existing domain adaptation approaches overwhelmingly
neglect the degrees of difficulty and deploy exactly the same framework for all
of the target samples. Generally, a simple or shadow framework is fast but
rough. A sophisticated or deep framework, on the contrary, is accurate but
slow. In this paper, we aim to challenge the fundamental contradiction between
the accuracy and speed in domain adaptation tasks. We propose a novel approach,
named {\it agile domain adaptation}, which agilely applies optimal frameworks
to different target samples and classifies the target samples according to
their adaptation difficulties. Specifically, we propose a paradigm which
performs several early detections before the final classification. If a sample
can be classified at one of the early stage with enough confidence, the sample
would exit without the subsequent processes. Notably, the proposed method can
significantly reduce the running cost of domain adaptation approaches, which
can extend the application scenarios of domain adaptation to even mobile
devices and real-time systems. Extensive experiments on two open benchmarks
verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

skew-adjoint operators including an axiomatic characterization. Our

(AGNs) point to the idea that some relativistic jets are suffocated by their
environment before we observe them. In these ""choked"" jets, all the jet's
kinetic energy is transferred into a hot and narrow cocoon of near-uniform
pressure. We consider the evolution of an elongated, axisymmetric cocoon formed
by a choked jet as it expands into a cold power-law ambient medium $\rho
\propto R^{-\alpha}$, in the case where the shock is decelerating ($\alpha<3$).
The evolution proceeds in three stages, with two breaks in behaviour: the first
occurs once the outflow has doubled its initial width, and the second once it
has doubled its initial height. Using the Kompaneets approximation, we derive
analytical formulae for the shape of the cocoon shock, and obtain approximate
expressions for the height and width of the outflow versus time in each of the
three dynamical regimes. The asymptotic behaviour is different for flat
($\alpha \le 2$) and steep ($2 < \alpha < 3$) density profiles. Comparing the
analytical model to numerical simulations, we find agreement to within $\sim15$
per cent out to 45 degrees from the axis, but discrepancies of a factor of 2-3
near the equator. The shape of the cocoon shock can be measured directly in
AGNs, and is also expected to affect the early light from failed GRB jets.
Observational constraints on the shock geometry provide a useful diagnostic of
the jet properties, even long after jet activity ceases.

interference experiment via multiple beam Ramsey interference [Phys. Rev. Lett.
86, 559 (2001)]. In this experiment, a selective scattering of photons from
just one interfering path causes decoherence. However, contrary to
expectations, there is an increase in the contrast of the interference pattern,
demonstrating that path selective decoherence can not only lead to a decrease,
but under certain conditions, to an increase of the fringe contrast. Here we
explain this seemingly counter-intuitive effect based on a model for a
multi-path interference, with four to six slits, in the presence of
decoherence. The effect of the environment is modeled via a coupling to a bath
of harmonic oscillators. When decoherence is introduced in one of the multiple
paths, an enhancement in fringe contrast is seen under certain conditions. A
similar effect is shown to appear if instead of path-selective decoherence, a
selective path detector is introduced. Our analysis points to the fact that
while traditional fringe visibility captures the wave nature in the two-path
case, it can fail in multi-path situations. We explain the enhancement of
fringe visibility and also show that quantum coherence based on the l1 norm of
coherence, in contrast to traditional visibility, remains a good quantifier of
wave nature, even in such situations. The enhancement of fringe contrast in the
presence of environmental decoherence underscores the limitations of
traditional visibility as a good measure for wave nature in quantifying
complementarity and also makes it an unlikely candidate for quantifying
decoherence. Our analysis could lead to better insight in ways to quantify
decoherence in multi-path interference, and in studies that seek to exploit
quantum superpositions and quantum coherence for quantum information
applications.

for this Lie algebra, there exists a quantification of its universal algebra.
This led to the definition of the famous quantum group SL(2). Another interest
of studying the rigid Lie algebras is the fact that there exists, for a given
dimension, only a finite number of isomorphic classes of rigid Lie algebras. So
we are tempted to establish a classification. This problem has been solved up
to the dimension 8. To continue in this direction, properties must be
established on the structure of these algebras. One of the first results
establishes an algebraicity criterion \cite{Carles}. However, the notion of
algebraicity which is used is not the classical notion and it includes
non-algebraic Lie algebras in the usual sense. The aim of this work is to show
that a the Lie algebra is rigid, then its algebra of inner derivations is
algebraic.

  Retrieval","Accepted to BMVC 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With a growing demand for the search by image, many works have studied the
task of fashion instance-level image retrieval (FIR). Furthermore, the recent
works introduce a concept of fashion attribute manipulation (FAM) which
manipulates a specific attribute (e.g color) of a fashion item while
maintaining the rest of the attributes (e.g shape, and pattern). In this way,
users can search not only ""the same"" items but also ""similar"" items with the
desired attributes. FAM is a challenging task in that the attributes are hard
to define, and the unique characteristics of a query are hard to be preserved.
Although both FIR and FAM are important in real-life applications, most of the
previous studies have focused on only one of these problem. In this study, we
aim to achieve competitive performance on both FIR and FAM. To do so, we
propose a novel method that converts a query into a representation with the
desired attributes. We introduce a new idea of attribute manipulation at the
feature level, by matching the distribution of manipulated features with real
features. In this fashion, the attribute manipulation can be done independently
from learning a representation from the image. By introducing the feature-level
attribute manipulation, the previous methods for FIR can perform attribute
manipulation without sacrificing their retrieval performance.

expressiveness of GCNs, concluding a modular GCN design, using different
propagation rules with residual connections could significantly improve the
performance of GCN. We demonstrate that such modular designs are capable of
distinguishing graphs from different graph generation models for surprisingly
small graphs, a notoriously difficult problem in network science. Our
investigation suggests that, depth is much more influential than width, with
deeper GCNs being more capable of learning higher order graph moments.
Additionally, combining GCN modules with different propagation rules is
critical to the representation power of GCNs.

several subchannels for which the far field approximation can be applied. Then,
the structure within and across different subchannels is leveraged using
message passing. We show how information about the antenna array geometry can
be used to design message passing factors that incorporate structure across
successive subchannels. Simulation results indicate that our framework can be
used to achieve better beam alignment with fewer channel measurements when
compared to standard compressed sensing-based techniques that do not exploit

investigate the stochastic dynamics of the emergence of a novel disease strain,
introduced into a population in which it must compete with an existing endemic
strain. In analogy with past work on single-strain epidemic outbreaks, we apply
a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that the new
strain becomes established. As expected, a critical determinant of the survival
prospects of any invading strain is the magnitude of its reproduction number
relative to that of the background endemic strain. Whilst in most circumstances
this ratio must exceed unity in order for invasion to be viable, we show that
differential control scenarios can lead to less-fit novel strains invading
populations hosting a fitter endemic one. This analysis and the accompanying
findings will inform our understanding of the mechanisms that have led to past

Properties of the bitcoin backbone protocol have been investigated in some
depth: the blockchain growth property quantifies the number of blocks added to
the blockchain during any time intervals; the blockchain quality property
ensures the honest miners always contribute at least a certain fraction of the
blockchain; the common prefix property ensures if a block is deep enough, it
will eventually be adopted by all honest miners with high probability.
Following the spirit of decoupling various functionalities of the blockchain,
the Prism protocol is proposed to dramatically improve the throughput while
maintaining the same level of security. Prior analyses of the bitcoin and Prism
backbone protocols assume the lifespan of blockchain is finite. This paper
presents a streamlined and strengthened analysis without the finite horizon
assumption. Specifically, the results include a blockchain growth property, a
blockchain quality property, and a common prefix property of the bitcoin
backbone protocol, as well as the liveness and persistence of the Prism
backbone protocol regardless of whether the blockchains have a infinite

problem as deep metric learning which aims to learn global feature
representations of the scene seen by the two different views. Despite promising
results are obtained by such deep metric learning methods, they, however, fail
to exploit a crucial cue relevant for localization, namely, the spatial layout

the CVFT as network layers, which transports features from one domain to the

  Pooling","There is a bug in the method. The results are not correct",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Action Unit (AU) detection plays an important role for facial expression
recognition. To the best of our knowledge, there is little research about AU
analysis for micro-expressions. In this paper, we focus on AU detection in
micro-expressions. Microexpression AU detection is challenging due to the small
quantity of micro-expression databases, low intensity, short duration of facial
muscle change, and class imbalance. In order to alleviate the problems, we
propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Pooling (STAP) network for AU
detection in micro-expressions. Firstly, STAP is aggregated by a series of
convolutional filters of different sizes. In this way, STAP can obtain
multi-scale information on spatial and temporal domains. On the other hand,
STAP contains less parameters, thus it has less computational cost and is
suitable for micro-expression AU detection on very small databases.
Furthermore, STAP module is designed to pool discriminative information for
micro-expression AUs on spatial and temporal domains.Finally, Focal loss is
employed to prevent the vast number of negatives from overwhelming the
microexpression AU detector. In experiments, we firstly polish the AU
annotations on three commonly used databases. We conduct intensive experiments
on three micro-expression databases, and provide several baseline results on
micro-expression AU detection. The results show that our proposed approach
outperforms the basic Inflated inception-v1 (I3D) in terms of an average of F1-
score. We also evaluate the performance of our proposed method on
cross-database protocol. It demonstrates that our proposed approach is feasible
for cross-database micro-expression AU detection. Importantly, the results on
three micro-expression databases and cross-database protocol provide extensive
baseline results for future research on micro-expression AU detection.

requires a computational cost that grows exponential with the number of
particles. This computational complexity has been the main obstacle to
understanding various fundamental emergent phenomena in condensed matters such
as high-Tc superconductivity and the fractional quantum-Hall effect. The
difficulty arises because even the simplest models that are proposed to capture
those phenomena cannot be simulated on a classical computer. Recognizing this
problem in 1981, Richard Feynman envisioned a quantum simulator, an entirely
new type of machine that exploits quantum superposition and operates by
individually manipulating its constituting quantum particles and their
interactions. Recent advances in various experimental platforms from cold atoms
in optical lattices, trapped ions, to solid-state systems have brought the idea
of Feynman to the realm of reality. Among those, interacting photons in
superconducting circuits has been one of the promising platforms thanks to
their local controllability and long coherence times. Early theoretical
proposals have shown possibilities to realize quantum many-body phenomena of
light using coupled cavity arrays such as Mott to superfluid transitions and
fractional quantum Hall states. Start-of-the-art experiments include
realization of interacting chiral edge states and stroboscopic signatures of
localization of interacting photons in a three-site and a nine-site
superconducting circuit, respectively. Interacting photons also serve as a
natural platform to simulate driven-dissipative quantum many-body phenomena. A
72-site superconducting circuit has also recently been fabricated to study a
dissipative phase transition of light.

method is that it can flexibly incorporate various assumptions in tracking as a
cost matrix. First, we extend the Sinkhorn distance from two dimensions to
three dimensions. Using this three-dimensional distance, we compare the
performance of two types of tracking technique, namely tracking that associates
objects that are close to each other, which conventionally uses the
nearest-neighbor method, and tracking that assumes that the object is moving at
constant velocity, using three types of simulation data. The results suggest
that when tracking objects moving at constant velocity, our method is superior
to conventional nearest-neighbor tracking as long as the added noise is not
excessively large. We show that the Sinkhorn method can be applied effectively
to object tracking. Our simulation data analysis suggests that when objects are
moving at constant velocity, our method, which sets acceleration as a cost,
outperforms the traditional nearest-neighbor method in terms of tracking
objects. To apply the proposed method to real bioimaging data, it is necessary
to set an appropriate cost indicator based on the movement features.

of each good in their utility. This dynamic models a process of learning how to
bid and has been studied in a series of papers on Fisher and production

  - For linear utilities, the dynamic converges to market equilibrium utilities

in this temperature range \tau_{e-ph} and n of studied films vary weakly with
the thickness and square resistance. At 10 K electron-phonon scattering times
are in the range 11.9-17.5 ps. The data extracted from magnetoconductance
measurements were used to describe the experimental photoresponse with the
two-temperature model. For thick films, the photoresponse is reasonably well
described without fitting parameters, however, for thinner films, the fit
requires a smaller heat capacity of phonons. We attribute this finding to the
reduced density of phonon states in thin films at low temperatures. We also

devices and applications are envisioned as major milestones that will
revolutionize the way by which societies create, distribute and consume
information. The remarkable expansion of wireless data traffic that we are
witnessing recently has advocated the investigation of suitable regimes in the
radio spectrum to satisfy users' escalating requirements and allow the
development and exploitation of both massive capacity and massive connectivity
of heterogeneous infrastructures. To this end, the Terahertz (THz) frequency
band (0.1-10 THz) has received noticeable attention in the research community
as an ideal choice for scenarios involving high-speed transmission.
Particularly, with the evolution of technologies and devices, advancements in
THz communication is bridging the gap between the millimeter wave (mmW) and
optical frequency ranges. Moreover, the IEEE 802.15 suite of standards has been
issued to shape regulatory frameworks that will enable innovation and provide a
complete solution that crosses between wired and wireless boundaries at 100
Gbps. Nonetheless, despite the expediting progress witnessed in THz wireless
research, the THz band is still considered one of the least probed frequency
bands. As such, in this work, we present an up-to-date review paper to analyze
the fundamental elements and mechanisms associated with the THz system
architecture.

Specific Languages (DSLs) for solving large-scale, real-world problems, in

notoriously difficult to debug. While the database community has proposed
several data-provenance techniques that address the Declarative Debugging

  In this paper, we introduce a novel bottom-up Datalog evaluation strategy for
debugging: our provenance evaluation strategy relies on a new provenance
lattice that includes proof annotations, and a new fixed-point semantics for
semi-naive evaluation. A debugging query mechanism allows arbitrary provenance
queries, constructing partial proof trees of tuples with minimal height. We
integrate our technique into Souffle, a Datalog engine that synthesizes C++
code, and achieve high performance by using specialized parallel data
structures. Experiments are conducted with DOOP/DaCapo, producing proof
annotations for tens of millions of output tuples. We show that our method has
a runtime overhead of 1.27x on average while being more flexible than existing

with a rise in emission power that has the same slope as that of the main CCSN

late jets form stronger emission peaks than early jets. Late jets with a
kinetic energy of only about one percent of the kinetic energy of the CCSN

brightest peak of the enigmatic CCSN iPTF14hls that has several extra peaks in

into a sequence of systems of shift-XOR equations, and hence can be solved by a
sequence of calls to the shift-XOR elimination. As the decompositions of the

the contributions of different currents to a spike. The network model
identifies factors ensuring non-pathological activity and suggests an

models for phylogenetic trees have already been established, little is known

fill this gap in the literature. To begin with, we derive both recursive and
closed expressions for the minimum Colless index of a tree with $n$ leaves.
Surprisingly, these expressions show a connection between the minimum Colless

characterize the tree shapes that achieve this minimum value and we introduce
both an algorithm to generate them and a recurrence to count them. After
focusing on two extremal classes of trees with minimum Colless index (the
maximally balanced trees and the greedy from the bottom trees), we conclude by
showing that all trees with minimum Colless index also have minimum Sackin

In our work, we discuss the first experiment conducted on a polaritonic lattice
at ambient conditions: We utilize fluorescent proteins as an excitonic gain
material, providing ultra-stable Frenkel excitons. We directly take advantage
of their soft nature by mechanically shaping them in the photonic
one-dimensional lattice. We demonstrate controlled loading of the condensate in
distinct orbital lattice modes of different symmetries, and finally explore, as
an illustrative example, the formation of a gap solitonic mode, driven by the
interplay of effective interaction and negative effective mass in our lattice.
The observed phenomena in our open dissipative system are comprehensively
scrutinized by a nonequilibrium model of polariton condensation. We believe,
that this work is establishing the organic polariton platform as a serious

radial metallicity gradients of four small, low-mass spiral galaxies. The
analysis of the outer disk of one of them, NGC 1058, uncovers the
characteristic flattening found in similar extended disk galaxies. After
combining these data with published long-slit observations of nearby spiral
galaxies, no evidence for a dependence of the disk scale length-normalized
metallicity gradients with stellar mass is found, down to log(M*/Msun) ~ 8.5.
The abundance gradients derived from these observations are compared to
predictions from recent cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution, finding
that in several cases the simulations fail to reproduce the mean steepening of
the gradients, expressed in dex/kpc, with decreasing stellar mass for
present-day galaxies, or do not extend to sufficiently small stellar masses for
a meaningful comparison. The mean steepening of the abundance gradients (in
dex/kpc) with decreasing disk scale length is in qualitative agreement with
predictions from the inside-out model of Boissier & Prantzos, although the
predicted slopes are systematically steeper than observed. This indicates the
necessity of including processes such as outflows and radial mixing in similar
models of galactic chemical evolution. Published spatially resolved metallicity
and photometric data of dwarf irregular galaxies suggest that significant, but
transitory, metallicity gradients can develop for systems that have experienced
recent (t < 100 Myr) enhanced star formation in their inner disks.

mean performance as compared to using the basic RL objective, which boils down
to solving the MDP with maximum likelihood. Here, we build on that work and
improve more precisely the SPI with Baseline Bootstrapping algorithm (SPIBB) by
allowing the policy search over a wider set of policies. Instead of binarily
classifying the state-action pairs into two sets (the \textit{uncertain} and

the error in the value estimates by constraining the policy change according to
the local model uncertainty. The method can take more risks on uncertain

conservative than the state-of-the-art methods. We propose two algorithms (one

The idea is illustrated by considering the decoherence dynamics of an external
read-out qubit that probes a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with either pure
dephasing or dissipative coupling. Qubit decoherence features and
non-Markovianity measure clearly signal the topological phase transition of the
SSH chain.

elections. Each position in each individual ranking is worth a certain number
of points; the total sum of points determines the aggregate ranking. The
question is how to choose a scoring rule for a specific application. First, we
derive a one-parameter family with geometric scores which satisfies two
principles of independence: once an extremely strong or weak candidate is
removed, the aggregate ranking ought to remain intact. This family includes
Borda count, generalised plurality (medal count), and generalised antiplurality
(threshold rule) as edge cases, and we find which additional axioms
characterise these rules. Second, we introduce a one-parameter family with
optimal scores: the athletes should be ranked according to their expected
overall quality. Finally, using historical data from biathlon, golf, and
athletics we demonstrate how the geometric and optimal scores can simplify the
selection of suitable scoring rules, show that these scores closely resemble
the actual scores used by the organisers, and provide an explanation for
empirical phenomena observed in biathlon and golf tournaments. We see that
geometric scores approximate the optimal scores well in events where the
distribution of athletes' performances is roughly uniform.

heterogeneous and divisible resource among multiple agents. Two of the most
commonly studied fairness concepts in cake cutting are proportionality and
envy-freeness. It is well known that a proportional allocation among $n$ agents
can be found efficiently via simple protocols [16]. For envy-freeness, in a
recent breakthrough, Aziz and Mackenzie [5] proposed a discrete and bounded
envy-free protocol for any number of players. However, the protocol suffers
from high multiple-exponential query complexity and it remains open to find
simpler and more efficient envy-free protocols.
  In this paper we consider a variation of the cake cutting problem by assuming
an underlying graph over the agents whose edges describe their acquaintance
relationships, and agents evaluate their shares relatively to those of their
neighbors. An allocation is called locally proportional if each agent thinks
she receives at least the average value over her neighbors. Local
proportionality generalizes proportionality and is in an interesting middle
ground between proportionality and envy-freeness: its existence is guaranteed
by that of an envy-free allocation, but no simple protocol is known to produce
such a locally proportional allocation for general graphs. Previous works
showed locally proportional protocols for special classes of graphs, and it is
listed in both [1] and [8] as an open question to design simple locally
proportional protocols for more general classes of graphs. In this paper we
completely resolved this open question by presenting a discrete and bounded
locally proportional protocol for any given graphs. Our protocol has a query
complexity of only single exponential, which is significantly smaller than the
six towers of $n$ query complexity of the envy-free protocol given in [5].

-- makes depth reduction a vital task in quantum-circuit design. Moore and
Nilsson (SIAM Journal of Computing, 2001) demonstrated that additional qubits
-- known as ancillae -- can be used to provide an extended space to parallelize
quantum circuits. Specifically, they proved that, with $O(n^2)$ ancillae, any
$n$-qubit CNOT circuit can be transformed into an equivalent one of $O(\log n)$
depth. However, the near-term quantum technologies can only support a limited
amount of qubits, making space-depth trade-off a fundamental research subject
for quantum-circuit synthesis.
  In this work, we establish an asymptotically optimal space-depth trade-off
for CNOT circuits. We prove that any $n$-qubit CNOT circuit can be parallelized
to $$O\left(\max\left\{\log n, \frac{n^2}{(n+m)\log (n+m)}\right\}\right)$$
depth with $m$ ancillae. This bound is tight even if the task is expanded from
exact synthesis to the approximation of CNOT circuits with arbitrary two-qubit
quantum gates. Our result can be extended to stabilizer circuits via the
reduction by Aaronson and Gottesman (Physical Review A, 2004). Furthermore, we
provide hardness evidence for optimizing CNOT circuits in terms of size or
depth. Our result has improved upon two previous papers that motivated our
work. Moore-Nilsson's construction (aforementioned) for $O(\log n)$-depth CNOT
circuit synthesis: We have reduced their need for ancillae by a factor of
$\log^2 n$ by showing that $m= O(n^2/\log^2 n)$ additional qubits -- which is
asymptotically optimal -- suffice to build equivalent $O(\log n)$-depth
$O(n^2/\log n)$-size CNOT circuits. Patel-Markov-Hayes's construction (Quantum
Information & Computation 2008) for $m = 0$: We have reduced their depth by a
factor of $n$ and achieved the asymptotically optimal bound of $O(n/\log n)$.

with all data points as singleton clusters, it successively merges two clusters
to form a clustering with one cluster less. The pair of clusters is chosen to
(locally) minimize the $k$-means cost of the clustering in the next step.
  Complete linkage algorithms are very popular for hierarchical clustering
problems, yet their theoretical properties have been studied relatively little.
For the Euclidean $k$-center problem, Ackermann et al. show that the
$k$-clustering in the hierarchy computed by complete linkage has a worst-case
approximation ratio of $\Theta(\log k)$. If the data lies in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
constant dimension $d$, the guarantee improves to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but the
$\mathcal{O}$-notation hides a linear dependence on $d$. Complete linkage for
$k$-median or $k$-means has not been analyzed so far.
  In this paper, we show that Ward's method computes a $2$-approximation with
respect to the $k$-means objective function if the optimal $k$-clustering is
well separated. If additionally the optimal clustering also satisfies a balance
condition, then Ward's method fully recovers the optimum solution. These
results hold in arbitrary dimension. We accompany our positive results with a
lower bound of $\Omega((3/2)^d)$ for data sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that holds if
no separation is guaranteed, and with lower bounds when the guaranteed
separation is not sufficiently strong. Finally, we show that Ward produces an

impressive performance for various visual recognition scenarios. CNNs trained
on large labeled datasets can not only obtain significant performance on most
challenging benchmarks but also provide powerful representations, which can be
used to a wide range of other tasks. However, the requirement of massive
amounts of data to train deep neural networks is a major drawback of these
models, as the data available is usually limited or imbalanced. Fine-tuning
(FT) is an effective way to transfer knowledge learned in a source dataset to a
target task. In this paper, we introduce and systematically investigate several
factors that influence the performance of fine-tuning for visual recognition.
These factors include parameters for the retraining procedure (e.g., the
initial learning rate of fine-tuning), the distribution of the source and
target data (e.g., the number of categories in the source dataset, the distance
between the source and target datasets) and so on. We quantitatively and
qualitatively analyze these factors, evaluate their influence, and present many
empirical observations. The results reveal insights into what fine-tuning
changes CNN parameters and provide useful and evidence-backed intuitions about
how to implement fine-tuning for computer vision tasks.

unit cell contains equal amount of U and Th. Any change in normalized Th
content, as we move towards the U and Th end-members of the series, shows a
significant jump in zircon-reidite transition pressure. In order to explain
this behavior, we proposed a novel method of quantifying the distortions of
U/Th-coordination polyhedra which manifest themselves as a triangular
dodecahedron or snub-disphenoid. We have theoretically defined two parameters:
one related to the two geometrically different U/Th-O bond lengths, having a
fixed ratio between them for regular triangular dodecahedra irrespective of the
volume and the other with three kinds of O-U-O and O-Th-O bond angles with
multiplicities of 2, 4 and 12, respectively. The bond angle distortion for both
U and Th-polyhedra were found to show a maximum in zircon phase and a minimum
in reidite phase corresponding to Th/(U+Th) = 0.5. Since, the difference in
angular distortion is minimum in case of Th/(U+Th) = 0.5, a lesser hydrostatic
pressure is capable of triggering the transition, compared to the other members
of this series. The bond length distortion is also characterized by a maximum
in the reidite phase at the equal concentration of U and Th. Our finding is
also complemented by the minimum compressibility observed in the zircon phase
when the atomic percentage of U and Th are equal.

for realizing rich exotic physical phenomena, including quantum anomalous Hall
effect, axion electrodynamics and Majorana fermions. However, these unusual
effects typically require extreme experimental conditions such as ultralow
temperature or sophisticate material growth and fabrication. Recently, new
intrinsic magnetic topological insulators were proposed in MnBi2Te4-family
compounds - on which rich topological effects could be realized under much
relaxed experimental conditions. However, despite the exciting progresses, the
detailed electronic structures observed in this family of compounds remain
controversial up to date. Here, combining the use of synchrotron and laser
light sources, we carried out comprehensive and high resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy studies on MnBi2Te4, and clearly identified its
topological electronic structures including the characteristic gapless
topological surface states. In addition, the temperature evolution of the
energy bands clearly reveals their interplay with the magnetic phase transition
by showing interesting differences for the bulk and surface states,
respectively. The identification of the detailed electronic structures of
MnBi2Te4 will not only help understand its exotic properties, but also pave the
way for the design and realization of novel phenomena and applications.

numerous applications, including computing the leakage of deterministic
programs in Quantitative Information Flow. Model counting is a hard,
#P-complete problem. For this reason, many approximate counters have been
developed in the last decade, offering formal guarantees of confidence and
accuracy. A popular approach is based on the idea of using random XOR
constraints to, roughly, successively halving the solution set until no model
is left: this is checked by invocations to a SAT solver. The effectiveness of
this procedure hinges on the ability of the SAT solver to deal with XOR
constraints, which in turn crucially depends on the length of such constraints.
We study to what extent one can employ sparse, hence short, constraints,
keeping guarantees of correctness. We show that the resulting bounds are
closely related to the geometry of the set of models, in particular to the
minimum Hamming distance between models. We evaluate our theoretical results on
a few concrete formulae. Based on our findings, we finally discuss possible
directions for improvements of the current state of the art in approximate

recent breakthroughs in deep learning have allowed to improve. However, deep
learning methods in general are not yet widely used in practice since they
require large amount of data for training complex models. This is particularly
challenging for biomedical images, because data and ground truths are a scarce
resource. Annotation efforts for biomedical images come with a real cost, since
experts have to manually label images at pixel-level on samples usually
containing many instances of the target anatomy (e.g. in histology samples:
neurons, astrocytes, mitochondria, etc.). In this paper we provide a framework
for Deep Active Learning applied to a real-world scenario. Our framework relies
on the U-Net architecture and overall uncertainty measure to suggest which
sample to annotate. It takes advantage of the uncertainty measure obtained by
taking Monte Carlo samples while using Dropout regularization scheme.
Experiments were done on spinal cord and brain microscopic histology samples to
perform a myelin segmentation task. Two realistic small datasets of 14 and 24
images were used, from different acquisition settings (Serial Block-Face
Electron Microscopy and Transmitting Electron Microscopy) and showed that our
method reached a maximum Dice value after adding 3 uncertainty-selected samples
to the initial training set, versus 15 randomly-selected samples, thereby
significantly reducing the annotation effort. We focused on a plausible
scenario and showed evidence that this straightforward implementation achieves
a high segmentation performance with very few labelled samples. We believe our
framework may benefit any biomedical researcher willing to obtain fast and
accurate image segmentation on their own dataset. The code is freely available

promises to reduce costs. Here a common baseline may be derived by fitting a
probability density function to past lifetimes and then utilizing the
(conditional) expected remaining useful life as a prognostic. This approach
finds widespread use in practice because of its high explanatory power. A more
accurate alternative is promised by machine learning, where forecasts
incorporate deterioration processes and environmental variables through sensor

the flexibility of deep learning. The parameters are estimated via variational

However, it is also possible to compare different past light cones. This is the
concept behind the redshift drift, a model-independent probe of fundamental
cosmology. In simple physical terms, this effectively allows us to watch the
Universe expand in real time. While current facilities only allow sensitivities
several orders of magnitude worse than the expected signal, it should be
possible to detect it with forthcoming ones. Here we discuss the potential
impact of measurements by three such facilities: the Extremely Large Telescope
(the subject of most existing redshift drift forecasts), but also the Square
Kilometre Array and intensity mapping experiments. For each of these we assume
the measurement sensitivities estimated respectively in Liske {\it et al.}
(2008), Klockner {\it et al.} (2015) and Yu {\it et al.} (2014). We focus on
the role of these measurements in constraining dark energy scenarios,
highlighting the fact that although on their own they yield comparatively weak
constraints, they do probe regions of parameter space that are typically
different from those probed by other experiments, as well as being
redshift-dependent. Specifically, we quantify how combinations of several
redshift drift measurements at different redshifts, or combinations of redshift
drift measurements with those from other canonical cosmological probes, can
constrain some representative dark energy models. Our conclusion is that a
model-independent mapping of the expansion of the universe from redshift $z=0$
to $z=4$---a challenging but feasible goal for the next generation of
astrophysical facilities---can have a significant impact on fundamental
cosmology.

uncertainty and require stochastic mortality models. The current paper
investigates forward mortality models driven by a (possibly infinite
dimensional) Wiener process and a compensated Poisson random measure. A major
innovation of the paper is the introduction of a family of processes called
forward mortality improvements which provide a flexible tool for a simple
construction of stochastic forward mortality models. In practice, the notion of
mortality improvements are a convenient device for the quantification of
changes in mortality rates over time that enables, for example, the detection
of cohort effects.
  We show that the forward mortality rates satisfy Heath-Jarrow-Morton-type
consistency conditions which translate to the forward mortality improvements.
While the consistency conditions of the forward mortality rates are analogous
to the classical conditions in the context of bond markets, the conditions of
the forward mortality improvements possess a different structure: forward
mortality models include a cohort parameter besides the time horizon; these two
dimensions are coupled in the dynamics of consistent models of forwards
mortality improvements. In order to obtain a unified framework, we transform
the systems of It\^o-processes which describe the forward mortality rates and
improvements: in contrast to term-structure models, the corresponding
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) describe the random dynamics

non orthogonal multiple Access (NOMA) and 3-dimensional beam-forming (3DBF) can
be exploited. In this paper, we devise a novel joint radio resource allocation
and 3D multiple input single output (MISO) BF algorithm in NOMA-based
heterogeneous networks (HetNets) at which our main aim is to maximize the
profit of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). To this end, we consider
multiple infrastructure providers (InPs) and MVNOs serving multiple users. Each
InP has multiple access points as base stations (BSs) with specified spectrum
and multi-beam antenna array in each transmitter that share its spectrum with
users by employing NOMA. To realize this, we formulate a novel optimization
problem at which the main aim is to maximize the revenue of MVNOs, subject to
resource limitations and quality of service (QoS) constraints. Since our
proposed optimization problem is non-convex, NP-hard and mathematically
intractable, we transform it into a convex one by introducing a new
optimization variable and converting the variables with adopting successive
convex approximation. More importantly, the proposed solution is assessed and
compared with the alternative search method and the optimal solution that is
obtained with adopting the exhaustive search method. In addition, the proposed
algorithm is studied from the computational complexity, convergence, and
performance perspective. Our simulation results demonstrate that NOMA-3DBF has
better performance and increases system throughput and revenue of MVNOs
compared to orthogonal multiple access with 2DBF by approximately 64%.
Especially, by exploiting 3DBF the revenue of MVNOs is improved by nearly 27%
in contrast to 2DBF in a high order of antennas.

its distribution on the smallest scales. For many practical purposes,

four simple analytic models of the amplification probability distribution,

multiplicative model, where the total amplification is assumed to be the

  Methods: 5,588 normal and anomalous macular OCT volumes (162,721 B-scans),
acquired at independent centres in five countries, were processed using the
software. Results were evaluated against ground truth provided by the dataset
owners.
  Results: Pegasus-OCT performed with AUROCs of at least 98% for all datasets
in the detection of general macular anomalies. For scans of sufficient quality,
the AUROCs for general AMD and DME detection were found to be at least 99% and
98%, respectively.
  Conclusions: The ability of a clinical decision support system to cater for
different populations is key to its adoption. Pegasus-OCT was shown to be able
to detect AMD, DME and general anomalies in OCT volumes acquired across
multiple independent sites with high performance. Its use thus offers
substantial promise, with the potential to alleviate the burden of growing

a linear combination of expectation values of $\hat{\sigma}_x$ observed after
subjecting the qubit to dynamical decoupling sequences of $\pi$ pulses, with

difference in the efficiency. The emission from the reverse shock can maintain
high efficiency for a long time, and becomes important at the late phase of the

the late phase of the light curve when the diffusion time of photons in the

the consistency in turn neglects some discriminative features. For example,
when estimating the conversion rate (CVR), i.e., the probability that a user
would purchase the item if she clicked it, features like dwell time on the item
detailed page are informative. However, CVR prediction should be conducted for
on-line ranking before the click happens. Thus we cannot get such post-event
features during serving.
  We define the features that are discriminative but only available during
training as the privileged features. Inspired by the distillation techniques
which bridge the gap between training and inference, in this work, we propose
privileged features distillation (PFD). We train two models, i.e., a student
model that is the same as the original one and a teacher model that
additionally utilizes the privileged features. Knowledge distilled from the
more accurate teacher is transferred to the student to improve its accuracy.
During serving, only the student part is extracted and it relies on no
privileged features. We conduct experiments on two fundamental prediction tasks
at Taobao recommendations, i.e., click-through rate (CTR) at coarse-grained
ranking and CVR at fine-grained ranking. By distilling the interacted features
that are prohibited during serving for CTR and the post-event features for CVR,
we achieve significant improvements over their strong baselines. During the

the conversion metric is improved by +2.3% in the CVR task. Besides, by

Inspired by the expected proportionality between periods of orbital motion and
NS mass we present a straightforward comparison among these sources. We
investigate relations between QPO periods and their ratios and identify
characteristic time scales of QPOs associated to individual sources. These
timescales are likely determined by the relative mass of each NS. We show that
the characteristic time scale of the millisecond pulsar XTE J1807.4-294 is
longer than for most other NS LMXBs. Consequently, models of QPOs that consider
geodesic orbital frequencies imply that the X-ray pulsars' mass has to be about
50 % higher than the average mass of other sources. Consideration of other
X-ray pulsars indicates that the exceptionality of XTE J1807.4-294 cannot be

admixture of a $6_c-\bar 6_c$ state and a $\bar 3_c-3_c$ one, where $6_c-\bar
6_c$($\bar 3_c-3_c$) denotes the color configuration with a $6_c$ ($\bar 3_c$)
diquark and a $\bar 6_c$ ($3_c$) antidiquark. For the tetraquark states $bb\bar
b\bar b$ and $cc\bar c\bar c$ with $J^{PC}={0^{++}}$, the $6_c-\bar 6_c$ state
is lower than the $\bar 3_c-3_c$ one in both the two quark models, while the
order of the $bb\bar c\bar c$ states depend on models. The $6_c-\bar 6_c$ and
$\bar 3_c-3_c$ mixing effects are induced by the hyperfine interactions between
the diquark and antidiquark, while the contributions from the
one-gluon-exchange (OGE) Coulomb or the linear confinement potentials vanish
for the $QQ\bar Q'\bar Q'$ system. With the couple-channel effects, we obtain
the similar mass spectra. The numerical results show that the ground $QQ\bar
Q'\bar Q'$ ($Q=b,c$ and $Q'=b,c$) tetraquark states are located above the
corresponding scattering states, which indicates that there may not exist a
bound state in the scheme of the two quark models.

safely drive through a crowd of pedestrians while the vehicle tries to keep the
desired speed as much as possible. This requires a model that can predict the
motion of crowd pedestrians and a method for the vehicle to predictively adjust
its speed. In this study, the model-based predictive control (MPC) was combined
with a social-force based vehicle-crowd interaction (VCI) model to regulate the
longitudinal speed of the autonomous vehicle. The predictive feature of the VCI
model can be precisely utilized by the MPC. A criterion for simultaneously
guaranteeing pedestrian safety and keeping the desired speed was designed, and
consequently, the MPC was formulated as a standard quadratic programming (QP)
problem, which can be easily solved by standard QP toolbox. The proposed
approach was compared with the traditional proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) control approach for regulating longitudinal speed. Scenarios of
different pedestrian density were evaluated in simulation. The results
demonstrated the merits of the proposed method to address this type of problem.
It also shows the potential of extending the method to address more complex
vehicle-pedestrian interaction situations.

Researchers have proposed reliable auction rules that work in extremely general

However, these protocols require significant payments from participants
resulting in low aggregate welfare. Here we address this shortcoming by casting
auction rule design as a statistical learning problem, and trade generality for
participant welfare effectively and automatically with a novel deep learning

fixation probabilities obeying two different ""laws"" in large and small

three-species models subject to a randomly switching carrying capacity modeling
the endless change between states of resources scarcity and abundance. Focusing
mainly on the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors game, equivalent to the cyclic
Lotka-Volterra model, we study how the ${\it coupling}$ of demographic and
environmental noise influences the fixation properties. More specifically, we
investigate which species is the most likely to prevail in a population of
fluctuating size and how the outcome depends on the environmental variability.
We show that demographic noise coupled with environmental randomness ""levels
the field"" of cyclic competition by balancing the effect of selection. In
particular, we show that fast switching effectively reduces the selection
intensity proportionally to the variance of the carrying capacity. We determine
the conditions under which new fixation scenarios arise, where the most likely
species to prevail changes with the rate of switching and the variance of the
carrying capacity. Random switching has a limited effect on the mean fixation
time that scales linearly with the average population size. Hence,
environmental randomness makes the cyclic competition more egalitarian, but
does not prolong the species coexistence. We also show how the fixation
probabilities of close-to-zero-sum rock-paper-scissors games can be obtained
from those of the zero-sum model by rescaling the selection intensity.

synthetic data to avoid the data labeling. Although it is easy to generate
labels for synthetic data, the results are much worse compared to those using
real data and manual labeling. The degradation of the performance is mainly due
to the domain gap, i.e., the discrepancy of the pixel value statistics between
real and synthetic data. In this paper, we observe that real and synthetic
humans both have a skeleton (pose) representation. We found that the skeletons
can effectively bridge the synthetic and real domains during the training. Our
proposed approach takes advantage of the rich and realistic variations of the
real data and the easily obtainable labels of the synthetic data to learn
multi-person part segmentation on real images without any human-annotated
labels. Through experiments, we show that without any human labeling, our
method performs comparably to several state-of-the-art approaches which require
human labeling on Pascal-Person-Parts and COCO-DensePose datasets. On the other
hand, if part labels are also available in the real-images during training, our
method outperforms the supervised state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

early diagnosis of debilitating diseases. Recent progress in sensor development

not adequately discussed is the issue of measurement fidelity in such sensors.
We define measurement fidelity based on the false positive rate of the system
as we expect systems with higher sensitivity to concomitantly respond more to
interfering molecules thus increasing the false-positive rates. We present a
model which allows us to estimate the limit of detection of a biosensor system
constrained by a specified false-positive rate. Two major results emerging from
our model is that a) there is a lower bound to the detection limit for a target
molecule determined by the variation in the concentration of background
molecules interfering with the molecular recognition process and b) systems
which use a secondary label, such as a fluorophore, can achieve lower detection
limits for a given false positive rate. We also present data collected from
literature to support our model. The insights from our model will be useful in
the systematic design of future clinical biosensors to achieve relevant
detection limits with assured fidelity.

observational effects. Here we theoretically investigate the collective
oscillations inherent to the fine structure of the corona. We have called them
fundamental vibrations because they cannot exist in a uniform medium. We use
the T-matrix technique to find the normal modes of random arrangements of
parallel strands. We consider an increasing number of tubes to understand the
vibrations of a huge number of tubes of a large portion of the corona. We
additionally generate synthetic time-distance Doppler and line broadening
diagrams of the vibrations of a coronal region to compare with observations. We
have found that the fundamental vibrations are in the form of clusters of tubes
where not all the tubes participate in the collective mode. The periods are
distributed over a wide band of values. The width of the band increases with
the number of strands but rapidly reaches an approximately constant value. The
frequency band associated with the fine structure of the corona depends on the
minimum separation between strands. We have found that the coupling between the
strands is of large extent. The synthetic Dopplergrams and line-broadening maps
show signatures of collective vibrations, not present in the case of purely
random individual kink vibrations. We conclude that the fundamental vibrations
of the corona can contribute to the energy budget of the corona and they may

be quickly neutralized so that there should not exist significantly charged,
non-spinning black holes in the universe. The case of spinning, charged
(Kerr-Newmann) black holes is more complicated. For a given initial position
and initial velocity of the particle, an oppositely charged particle does not
always more easily fall into the black hole than a neutral particle. The
possible existence of a magnetosphere further complicate the picture. One
therefore cannot straightforwardly conclude that a charged spinning black hole
will be neutralized. In this paper, we make the first step to investigate the
neutralization of Kerr-Newmann black holes without introducing a magnetosphere.
We track the particle trajectories under the influence of the curved spacetime
and the electromagnetic field carried by the spinning, charged black hole. A
statistical method is used to investigate the neutralization problem. We find a
universal dependence of the falling probability into the black hole on the
charge of the test particle, with the oppositely charged particles having a
higher probability of falling. We therefore conclude that charged, spinning
black holes without a magnetosphere should be quickly neutralized, consistent
with people's intuition. The neutralization problem of Kerr-Newmann black holes

During the nonlinear phase of tearing mode evolution, there develops a regime
in which the magnetic energy density shows a spectrum with a power-law close to
$B(k)^2\sim k^{-0.8}$. Such an energy spectrum is found in correspondence of
the neutral line, within the diffusion region of the primary current sheet,
where energy is conveyed towards smaller scales via a ``recursive'' process of
fast tearing-type instabilities. Far from the neutral line we find that
magnetic energy spectra evolve towards slopes compatible with the ``standard''
Kolmogorov spectrum. Starting from a self-similar description of the nonlinear
stage at the neutral line, we provide a model that predicts a reconnecting
magnetic field energy spectrum scaling as $k^{-4/5}$, in good agreement with
numerical results. An extension of the predicted power-law to generic current
sheet profiles is also given and possible implications for turbulence
phenomenology are discussed. These results provide a step forward to understand
the ``recursive'' generation of magnetic islands (plasmoids), which has been
proposed as a possible explanation for the energy release during flares, but
which, more in general, can have an impact on the subsequent turbulent
evolution of unstable sheets that naturally form in the high-Lundquist number

it is now possible to interface consumer computing hardware, e.g. inexpensive

straightforward upgrade paths, cost savings through leveraging an economy of

naturally permits multiple subscribers to a single raw data stream. This allows
multiple science programs to be conducted in parallel. When combined with broad
bandwidths and wide primary fields of view, radio telescopes become capable of
achieving many science goals simultaneously. Moreover, because many science
programs are not strongly dependent on observing cadence and direction (e.g.
searches for extraterrestrial intelligence and radio transient surveys), these

scientific productivity and discovery potential of an observatory. In this

decompositions vanishes. We justify within the diquark model in QED that the
difference appears at two-loop level, supporting the interpretation of such a
difference as originating from the torque exerted by the spectator system on
the struck quark.

repeaterless QKD systems. After the proposal of the original protocol, multiple
papers have extended the protocol to prove its security. However, these works
are limited to the case where the two channels have equal amount of loss (i.e.
are symmetric). In a practical network setting, it is very likely that the
channels are asymmetric due to e.g. geographical locations. In this paper we
extend the ""simple TF-QKD"" protocol to the scenario with asymmetric channels.
We show that by simply adjusting the two signal states of the two users (and
not the decoy states) they can effectively compensate for channel asymmetry and
consistently obtain an order of magnitude higher key rate than previous
symmetric protocol. It also can provide 2-3 times higher key rate than the
strategy of deliberately adding fibre to the shorter channel until channels
have equal loss (and is more convenient as users only need to optimize their
laser intensities and do not need to physically modify the channels). We also
perform simulation for a practical case with three decoy states and finite data
size, and show that our method works well and has a clear advantage over prior
art methods with realistic parameters.

  We further study the relationship between the Bernstein-Sato variety attached

the first spectral and timing analysis at X-ray energies with XMM-Newton,
complemented with archival X-ray, optical, IR photometry and spectroscopy. The
X-ray emission shows bright and faint phases and total eclipses recurring every
2.38 h, consistent with optical properties. This firmly identifies 2PBC
J0658.0-1746 as an eclipsing polar, the second hard X-ray selected in the
orbital period gap. The X-ray orbital modulation changes from cycle-to-cycle
and the X-ray flux is strongly variable over the years, implying a
non-stationary mass accretion rate both on short and long timescales. The X-ray
eclipses allow to refine the orbital ephemeris with period 0.09913398(4) d, and
to constrain the binary inclination $79^{\rm\,o}\lesssim i \lesssim
90^{\rm\,o}$ and the mass ratio 0.18$\rm <M_2/M_{WD}<$0.40. A companion mass
M$_{2}=0.2-0.25\rm\,M_{\odot}$ with a radius R$_{2}=0.24-0.26\rm\,R_{\odot}$
and spectral type $\sim$M4, at D$=209^{+3}_{-2}\rm\,pc$, is derived. A lower
limit to the white dwarf mass of $\sim0.6\,\rm\,M_{\odot}$ is obtained from the
X-ray spectrum. An upper limit to the magnetic colatitude, $\beta \lesssim
50^{\rm\,o}$, and a shift in azimuth, $\psi\sim14^{\rm\,o}$, of the main
accreting pole are also estimated. The optical/IR spectral energy distribution
shows large excess in the mid-IR due to lower harmonics of cyclotron emission.
A high-state mass accretion rate
$\rm\,\sim0.4-1\times10^{-10}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$, lower than that of
cataclysmic variables above the gap and close to that of systems below it, is
estimated. With 2PBC J0658.0-1746, the number of hard X-ray selected polars
increases to thirteen members, suggesting that they are not as rare as
previously believed.

the set of traces of the compiled program into the set of traces of the

the languages are far apart or when observations are fine-grained. To overcome
this issue, we study a generalized compiler correctness definition, which uses

this view on compiler correctness can naturally account for undefined behavior,
resource exhaustion, different source and target values, side-channels, and

incompressible axisymmetric turbulent jet at a Reynolds number of 2400. The DNS
data enable accurate maps of the outer irrotational flow field, and also the
vorticity field in the turbulent core of the jet. It is found necessary to
define two separate boundaries of the jet. The first is an inner boundary
(turbulent/nonturbulent, T/NT), from where vorticity rises steeply towards to
the core. The second is an outer rotational/irrotational boundary, beyond which
the flow may be considered irrotational. The velocity field beyond the outer
boundary often has ordered, nearly irrotational circulatory motions. These can
be shown, in simpler cases, to be the velocity field induced by one or more
vorticity elements in a coherent structure in the turbulent core. A detailed
examination of axial and diametral sections indicates that there are periods
when there is a large inrush of ambient fluid into parts of the T/NT interface,
which gets distorted into a gulf or well that can be both twisted and deep.
Sections of these wells often appear as what may be called as lakes of
irrotational fluid in diametral sections of the jet flow. Part of the inrushing
fluid crosses the T/NT interface within the well and is entrained into the
turbulent core, by a process that can legitimately be called nibbling. The
duration of such an inrush process can be of the order up to 20 flow units and
suggests that entrainment can be an episodic process in which an inrush event
accelerates ambient fluid even as it is pushed into a narrowing gulf, where it
penetrates the T/NT interface of the gulf by nibbling. In the turbulent round
jet, the entrainment burstiness is found to be of order 0.75, comparable to the
momentum flux burstiness found in a turbulent boundary layer.

system design. Managing that uncertainty requires new algorithmic tools to make
quantitative assessments. While prior uncertainty quantification methods, such
as generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), show how to work precisely under the
uncertainty inherent to physical devices, these approaches focus solely on
variables from a continuous domain. However, as one moves up the system stack
to the architecture level many parameters are constrained to a discrete
(integer) domain. This paper proposes an efficient and accurate uncertainty
modeling technique, named mixed generalized polynomial chaos (M-gPC), for
architectural uncertainty analysis. The M-gPC technique extends the generalized
polynomial chaos (gPC) theory originally developed in the uncertainty
quantification community, such that it can efficiently handle the mixed-type
(i.e., both continuous and discrete) uncertainties in computer architecture
design. Specifically, we employ some stochastic basis functions to capture the
architecture-level impact caused by uncertain parameters in a simulator. We
also develop a novel mixed-integer programming method to select a small number
of uncertain parameter samples for detailed simulations. With a few highly
informative simulation samples, an accurate surrogate model is constructed in
place of cycle-level simulators for various architectural uncertainty analysis.
In the chip-multiprocessor (CMP) model, we are able to estimate the propagated
uncertainties with only 95 samples whereas Monte Carlo requires 5*10^4 samples
to achieve the similar accuracy. We also demonstrate the efficiency and

learning (MARL). Global reward game is a subclass of cooperative games, where
all agents aim to maximize the global reward. Credit assignment is an important
problem studied in the global reward game. Most of previous works stood by the
view of non-cooperative-game theoretical framework with the shared reward
approach, i.e., each agent being assigned a shared global reward directly.
This, however, may give each agent an inaccurate reward on its contribution to
the group, which could cause inefficient learning. To deal with this problem,
we i) introduce a cooperative-game theoretical framework called extended convex
game (ECG) that is a superset of global reward game, and ii) propose a local
reward approach called Shapley Q-value. Shapley Q-value is able to distribute
the global reward, reflecting each agent's own contribution in contrast to the
shared reward approach. Moreover, we derive an MARL algorithm called Shapley
Q-value deep deterministic policy gradient (SQDDPG), using Shapley Q-value as
the critic for each agent. We evaluate SQDDPG on Cooperative Navigation,
Prey-and-Predator and Traffic Junction, compared with the state-of-the-art
algorithms, e.g., MADDPG, COMA, Independent DDPG and Independent A2C. In the
experiments, SQDDPG shows a significant improvement on the convergence rate.
Finally, we plot Shapley Q-value and validate the property of fair credit
assignment.

malignant liver lesions. The navigation of a needle to the lesion poses a
challenge for both the trainees and intervening physicians. Methods: This
publication presents a new GPU-based, accurate method for the simulation of
radio-frequency ablations for lesions at the needle tip in general and for an
existing visuo-haptic 4D VR simulator. The method is implemented real-time
capable with Nvidia CUDA. Results: It performs better than a literature method
concerning the theoretical characteristic of monotonic convergence of the
bioheat PDE and a in vitro gold standard with significant improvements (p <
0.05) in terms of Pearson correlations. It shows no failure modes or
theoretically inconsistent individual simulation results after the initial
phase of 10 seconds. On the Nvidia 1080 Ti GPU it achieves a very high frame
rendering performance of >480 Hz. Conclusion: Our method provides a more robust
and safer real-time ablation planning and intraoperative guidance technique,
especially avoiding the over-estimation of the ablated tissue death zone, which
is risky for the patient in terms of tumor recurrence. Future in vitro
measurements and optimization shall further improve the conservative estimate.

so-called Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which describes the training and
generalization of DNNs in the infinite-width setting. In this setting, we show
that for fully-connected DNNs, as the depth grows, two regimes appear: ""order"",
where the (scaled) NTK converges to a constant, and ""chaos"", where it converges
to a Kronecker delta. Extreme order slows down training while extreme chaos
hinders generalization. Using the scaled ReLU as a nonlinearity, we end up in
the ordered regime. In contrast, Layer Normalization brings the network into
the chaotic regime. We observe a similar effect for Batch Normalization (BN)
applied after the last nonlinearity. We uncover the same order and chaos modes
in Deep Deconvolutional Networks (DC-NNs). Our analysis explains the appearance
of so-called checkerboard patterns and border artifacts. Moving the network
into the chaotic regime prevents checkerboard patterns; we propose a
graph-based parametrization which eliminates border artifacts; finally, we
introduce a new layer-dependent learning rate to improve the convergence of
DC-NNs. We illustrate our findings on DCGANs: the ordered regime leads to a
collapse of the generator to a checkerboard mode, which can be avoided by
tuning the nonlinearity to reach the chaotic regime. As a result, we are able
to obtain good quality samples for DCGANs without BN.

  Learn",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite their accuracy, neural network-based classifiers are still prone to
manipulation through adversarial perturbations. Those perturbations are
designed to be misclassified by the neural network, while being perceptually
identical to some valid input. The vast majority of attack methods rely on
white-box conditions, where the attacker has full knowledge of the attacked
network's parameters. This allows the attacker to calculate the network's loss
gradient with respect to some valid input and use this gradient in order to
create an adversarial example. The task of blocking white-box attacks has
proven difficult to solve. While a large number of defense methods have been
suggested, they have had limited success. In this work we examine this
difficulty and try to understand it. We systematically explore the abilities
and limitations of defensive distillation, one of the most promising defense
mechanisms against adversarial perturbations suggested so far in order to
understand the defense challenge. We show that contrary to commonly held
belief, the ability to bypass defensive distillation is not dependent on an
attack's level of sophistication. In fact, simple approaches, such as the
Targeted Gradient Sign Method, are capable of effectively bypassing defensive
distillation. We prove that defensive distillation is highly effective against
non-targeted attacks but is unsuitable for targeted attacks. This discovery
leads us to realize that targeted attacks leverage the same input gradient that
allows a network to be trained. This implies that blocking them will require
losing the network's ability to learn, presenting an impossible tradeoff to the
research community.

The trained neural network is deployed to estimate the turbulent winds as

which we refer to as parameterized image operators. However, most existing deep
networks trained for these operators are only designed for one specific
parameter configuration, which does not meet the needs of real scenarios that
usually require flexible parameters settings. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a new decoupled learning algorithm to learn from the operator
parameters to dynamically adjust the weights of a deep network for image

another network, namely the weight learning network, which can be end-to-end
jointly trained with the base network. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed framework can be successfully applied to many traditional

scenarios, the proposed framework can be further extended to dynamically change
the weights of only one single layer of the base network while sharing most
computation cost. We demonstrate that this cheap parameter-tuning extension of
the proposed decoupled learning framework even outperforms the state-of-the-art

improved version of the Johnson, Kendall & Roberts (JKR) theory, in which
jump-in contact instabilities are conveniently considered as well as the
lateral interaction of the asperities and the coalescence of merging contact
spots. Results obtained on complex fractal geometries with several length
scales are accurate as demonstrated by the comparison with fully numerical
simulations and experimental investigations taken from the literature. Also,
the model quite well captures the distributions of the contact stresses, gaps,
and contact spots.

traced back to a high value placed on empirical reproducibility of the physical

experiments are often held to be the ideal of reproducibility as a cornerstone
of scientific practice. Victoria Stodden has claimed that the computer is an
analog for Boyle's pump -- another kind of scientific instrument that needs
detailed descriptions of how it generates results. In the place of Boyle's
hand-written notes, we now expect code in open source programming languages to
be available to enable others to reproduce and extend computational
experiments. In this paper we show that there is another genealogy for
reproducibility, starting at least from Euclid, in the production of proofs in
mathematics. Proofs have a distinctive quality of being necessarily
reproducible, and are the cornerstone of mathematical science. However, the
task of the modern mathematical scientist has drifted from that of blackboard
rhetorician, where the craft of proof reigned, to a scientific workflow that
now more closely resembles that of an experimental scientist. So, what is proof
in modern mathematics? And, if proof is unattainable in other fields, what is
due scientific diligence in a computational experimental environment? How do we
measure truth in the context of uncertainty? Adopting a manner of Lakatosian
conversant conjecture between two mathematicians, we examine how proof informs
our practice of computational statistical inquiry. We propose that a
reorientation of mathematical science is necessary so that its reproducibility
can be readily assessed.

environment has led to an increased focus on reducing energy consumption.
Feedback on the appliance level energy consumption can help in reducing the
energy demands of the consumers. Energy disaggregation techniques are used to
obtain the appliance level energy consumption from the aggregated energy
consumption of a house. These techniques extract the energy consumption of an
individual appliance as features and hence face the challenge of distinguishing
two similar energy consuming devices. To address this challenge we develop
methods that leverage the fact that some devices tend to operate concurrently
at specific operation modes. The aggregated energy consumption patterns of a
subgroup of devices allow us to identify the concurrent operating modes of
devices in the subgroup. Thus, we design hierarchical methods to replace the
task of overall energy disaggregation among the devices with a recursive
disaggregation task involving device subgroups. Experiments on two real-world
datasets show that our methods lead to improved performance as compared to
baseline. One of our approaches, Greedy based Device Decomposition Method
(GDDM) achieved up to 23.8%, 10% and 59.3% improvement in terms of

closed-form theoretical expressions linking fundamental system design and
environment parameters with the power consumption of analog front ends for
communication receivers. This collection of scaling laws and bounds is meant to
serve as a theoretical reference for practical low power front end design. In
one set of results, we first find that the front end power consumption scales
at least as SNDR^3/2 if environment parameters (fading and blocker levels) are
static. The obtained scaling law is subsequently used to derive relations
between front end power consumption and several other important communication
system parameters, namely, digital modulation constellation size, symbol error
probability, error control coding gain and coding rate. Such relations, in
turn, can be used when deciding which system design strategies to adopt for
low-power applications. For example, if error control coding is employed, the
most energy-efficient strategy for the entire receiver is to use codes with
moderate coding gain and simple decoding algorithms, such as convolutional
codes. In another collection of results, we find how front end power scales
with environment parameters if the performance is kept constant. This yields
bounds on average power reduction of receivers that adapt to the communication
environment. For instance, if a receiver front end adapts to fading
fluctuations while keeping the performance above some given minimum
requirement, power can theoretically be reduced at least 20x compared to a
non-adaptive front end.

To achieve this goal, it is paramount the adoption of sustainable management
techniques for agroecosystems. However, this is a complex task due to a large
number of variables involved. One of the solutions for the handling and
treatment of such diverse data is the use of Green IS. In this work, we adopt a
methodology called Indicators of Sustainability in Agroecosystems (Indicadores

system based on it and apply Data Science techniques over the gathered data -
from 100 real rural properties - to compute which are the most relevant ISA
Indicators for the final ISA Sustainability Index Score. As a result, we have
developed a set of tools for data collection, processing, visualization, and
analysis of the sustainability of a rural property or region, following the ISA
methodology. We also have that with only 7 of the 21 Indicators present in ISA
we can identify the level of sustainability in more than 90% of cases, allowing
for a new discussion about shrinking the amount of data needed for the
computation of ISA, or remodelling the final computation of the Sustainability

towards high ratings, and that users differ significantly in their usage of the
rating scale. Implementers usually compensate for these issues through rating
normalization or the inclusion of a user bias term in factorization models.
However, these methods adjust only for the central tendency of users'
distributions. In this work, we demonstrate that lack of \textit{flatness} in
rating distributions is negatively correlated with recommendation performance.
We propose a rating transformation model that compensates for skew in the
rating distribution as well as its central tendency by converting ratings into
percentile values as a pre-processing step before recommendation generation.
This transformation flattens the rating distribution, better compensates for
differences in rating distributions, and improves recommendation performance.
We also show a smoothed version of this transformation designed to yield more
intuitive results for users with very narrow rating distributions. A
comprehensive set of experiments show improved ranking performance for these
percentile transformations with state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms in
four real-world data sets.

  long-term growth? Assessment of the dynamics of feed-in tariff policy",,,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feed in tariff (FiT) is one of the most efficient ways that many governments
throughout the world use to stimulate investment in renewable energies (REs)
technology. For governments, financial management of the policy is very
challenging as that it needs a considerable amount of budget to support RE
producers during the long remuneration period. In this paper, we illuminate
that the early growth of REs capacity could be a temporary boost and the system
elements would backlash the policy if financial circumstances are not handled
well. To show this, we chose Iran as the case, which is in the infancy period
of FiT implementation. Iran started the implementation of FiT policy in 2015
aiming to achieve 5 GW of renewable capacity until 2021. Analyses show that the
probable financial crisis will not only lead to inefficient REs development
after the target time (2021), but may also cause the existing plants to fail.
Social tolerance for paying REs tax and potential investors trust emanated from
budget related mechanisms are taken into consideration in the system dynamics
model developed in this research to reflect those financial effects, which have
rarely been considered in the previous researches. To prevent the financial
crisis of the FiT funding and to maintain the stable growth in long term, three
policy scenarios are analyzed: continuation of the current program with higher
FiT rates, adjusting the FiT rates based on the budget status, and adjusting
the tax on electricity consumption for the development of REs based on the
budget status. The results demonstrate that adjusting the tax on electricity
consumption for the development of REs based on budget status leads to the best
policy result for a desired installed capacity development without any negative
social effects and financial crises.

the performance of various computer vision and robotics tasks. For this
purpose, we carefully design an image quality metric which captures
complementary quality attributes and ensures light-weight computation.
Specifically, our metric consists of a combination of image gradient, entropy,
and noise metrics. The synergy of these measures allows preserving sharp edge
and rich texture in the image while maintaining a low noise level. Using this
novel metric, we propose a real-time and fully automatic exposure and gain
control technique based on the Nelder-Mead method. To illustrate the
effectiveness of our technique, a large set of experimental results

within a signaling network, in which the enzyme is embedded, to grow
monotonically with the enzyme's rate of product formation. However, here we
observe that this does not necessarily hold true for allosterically regulated
enzymes, often observed in signaling networks. In particular, we find that the
mutual information between the catalytic sites of an allosterically regulated
enzyme and a receiver protein downstream in the signaling pathway depends on
the transition kinetics between the different allosterically regulated states
of the enzyme and their respective rates of product formation. Surprisingly,
our work implies that allosteric down-regulation of an enzyme's rate of product
formation may not only be used as a way to silence itself, as one would
normally expect. Rather, down-regulation may also be used to increase the
information communicated by this enzyme to a receiver protein downstream in a
signaling pathway.

been the material of choice for electro-optic modulators owing to its large
electro-optic response, wide transparent window, excellent thermal stability
and long-term material reliability. Conventional LN electro-optic modulators
while continue to be the workhorse of the optoelectronic industry become
progressively too bulky, expensive and power hungry to fully serve the needs of
this industry rapidly progressing towards highly integrated, cost-effective and
energy efficient components and circuits. Recently developed monolithic LN
nanophotonic platform enables the realization of electro-optic modulators that
are significantly improved in terms of compactness, bandwidth and energy
efficiency, while still demanding relatively long, on the mm-scale, interaction
lengths. Here we successfully deal with this challenge and demonstrate
plasmonic electro-optic directional coupler switches consisting of two closely
spaced nm-thin gold nanostripes monolithically fabricated on LN substrates that
guide both coupled electromagnetic modes and electrical signals influencing
their coupling and thereby enabling ultra-compact switching and
modulatiofunctionalities. The extreme confinement of both slow-plasmon modes
and electrostatic fields created by two nanostripes along with their nearly
perfect spatial overlap allowed us to achieve a 90% modulation depth with
20-$\mu$m-long switches characterized by a electro-optic modulation efficiency
of 0.3 Vcm. Our monolithic LN plasmonic platform enables ultra-dense
integration of high-performance active photonic components, enabling a wide
range of cost-effective optical communication applications demanding
$\mu$m-scale footprints, ultrafast operation, robust design and high
environmental stability.
