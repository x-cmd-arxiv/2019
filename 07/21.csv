behaviors, or computer viruses, affect biological, social, and technological
systems. Epidemic models for large populations and finite populations on
networks have been used to understand and control both transient and
steady-state behaviors. Typically it is assumed that after recovery from an
infection, every agent will either return to its original susceptible state or
acquire full immunity to reinfection. We study the network SIRI
(Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected) model, an epidemic model for the
spread of contagious processes on a network of heterogeneous agents that can
adapt their susceptibility to reinfection. The model generalizes existing
models to accommodate realistic conditions in which agents acquire partial or
compromised immunity after first exposure to an infection. We prove necessary
and sufficient conditions on model parameters and network structure that
distinguish four dynamic regimes: infection-free, epidemic, endemic, and
bistable. For the bistable regime, which is not accounted for in traditional
models, we show how there can be a rapid resurgent epidemic after what looks
like convergence to an infection-free population. We use the model and its
predictive capability to show how control strategies can be designed to
mitigate problematic contagious behaviors.

is to converge their electronic bands, which is known as band engineering. In
this regard, lots of effort have been made to further improve the
thermoelectric efficiency of bulk and exfoliated monolayers of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$
and Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. However, ultra-high band degeneracy and thus significant
improvement of power factor have not been yet realized in these materials.
Using first-principles methods, we demonstrate that the valley degeneracy of
Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ and Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ can be largely improved upon substitution
of the middle layer Te atoms with the more electronegative S or Se atoms. Our
detailed analysis reveals that in this family of materials two out of four
possible valence band valleys merely depend on the electronegativity of the
middle layer chalcogen atoms, which makes the independent modulation of the
valleys position feasible. As such, band alignment of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ and
Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ largely improves upon substitution of the middle layer Te
atoms with more electronegative, yet chemically similar, S and Se ones. A
superior valence band alignment is attained in Sb$_{2}$Te$_{2}$Se monolayers
where the three out of four possible valleys are well-aligned, resulting in a
giant band degeneracy of 18 that holds the record among all thermoelectric
materials.

rectification mechanism is not related to the chain asymmetry, but to the
asymmetry of the interaction of chain ends with thermostats, for instance, due
to different lengths of the end thermostats. The chain can be homogeneous, it
is only important that the thermal conductivity of the chain should depend on
temperature strict monotonically. The effect is maximal when convergence of the
thermal conductivity with increasing length just begins to manifest itself. In
this case, the efficiency of thermal rectification can reach 25%. These
conditions are met for carbon nanoribbons and nanotubes. Therefore, they can be
ideal objects for the construction of thermal rectifiers based on the

shows that the rectification of heat transfer can reach 14% for nanoribbons and

experimental observations of Raman spectroscopy measurement, we find that A1g
mode is higher in frequency than that of Eg mode. Moreover, the reason behind
the shift of A2u mode to higher frequency for monolayer of both SnO and PbO is
revealed from our calculations. We also find that long-range Coulomb
interaction enhances the dielectric constant and Born effective charges in bulk
SnO and bulk PbO, compared to their monolayer. Here, we observe avoided
crossing or Landau degeneracy between longitudinal acoustics (LA) and low
energetic transverse optical (TO) modes in bulk form of both SnO and PbO.
Additionally, monolayer SnO also shows low energetic Raman modes (Eg and A1g)
of same frequency as bulk. As a result, we notice avoided crossing between LA
and TO modes in monolayer SnO. Interestingly, higher Born effective charge and
low dielectric constant enhances self-force constants and the interatomic force
constants (IFCs) between the M-O bonds. The enhanced force constants give rise
to higher vibrational frequency of phonon modes for monolayer PbO. Our studies
reveal that due to avoided crossing between two degenerate bands, the phonon
dispersion near high symmetry X point lowers specific heat and vibrational
entropy in bulk SnO, bulk PbO and only in monolayer SnO upto temperature 150 K.
Moreover, the large mass difference between Pb and Oxygen atoms and absence of
interlayer van der Waal interactions give rise to high phonon vibration which
reduces the occurrence of band crossing between two degenerate energy levels.
The absence of avoided crossing leads higher specific heat and vibrational
entropy in monolayer PbO at low temperatures.

phases by quantum quenches, and study the emergent topology of quantum dynamics
when the quenches start from a deep or shallow trivial phase to topological
regimes. Two dynamical schemes are examined: One is to characterize topological
phases via quantum dynamics induced by a single quench along an arbitrary axis,
and the other applies a sequence of quenches with respect to all (pseudo)spin
axes. These two schemes are both built on the so-called dynamical bulk-surface
correspondence, which shows that the $d$-dimensional ($d$D) topological phases
with integer invariants can be characterized by the dynamical topological
pattern emerging on $(d-1)$D band inversion surfaces (BISs). We show that the
first dynamical scheme works for both deep and shallow quenches, the latter of
which is initialized in an incompletely polarized trivial phase. For the second
scheme, however, when the initial phase for the quench study varies from the
deep trivial (fully polarized) to shallow trivial (incompletely polarized)
regime, a new dynamical topological transition, associated with topological
charges crossing BISs, is predicted in quench dynamics. A generic criterion of
the dynamical topological transition is precisely obtained. Above the
criterion, quantum dynamics on BISs well characterizes the topology of the
post-quench Hamiltonian. Below the criterion, the quench dynamics may depict a
new dynamical topology; the post-quench topology can be characterized by the
emergent topological invariant plus the total charges moving outside the region
enclosed by BISs. We illustrate our results by numerically calculating the 2D
quantum anomalous Hall model. This work broadens the way to classify
topological phases by non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and has feasibility for

radius where the mass enclosed depends only on the projected tangential
velocity dispersion, assuming that the anisotropy profile slowly varies. This
is well-approximated at the radius where the log-slope of the stellar tracer
profile is $-2$: $r_{-2}$. The associated mass is $M(r_{-2}) = 2 G^{-1} \langle
\sigma_{\mathcal{T}}^{2}\rangle^{*} r_{-2}$ and the circular velocity is
$V^{2}({r_{-2}}) = 2\langle \sigma_{\mathcal{T}}^{2}\rangle^{*}$. For a Plummer
profile $r_{-2} \simeq 4R_e/5$. Importantly, $r_{-2}$ is smaller than the
characteristic radius for line-of-sight velocities derived by Wolf et al. 2010.
Together, the two estimators can constrain the mass profiles of
dispersion-supported galaxies. We illustrate its applicability using published
proper motion measurements of dwarf galaxies Draco and Sculptor, and find that
they are consistent with inhabiting cuspy NFW subhalos of the kind predicted in
CDM but we cannot rule out a core. We test our combined mass estimators against
previously-published, non-spherical cosmological dwarf galaxy simulations done
in both CDM and SIDM. For CDM, the estimates for the dynamic rotation curves
are found to be accurate to $10\%$ while SIDM are accurate to $15\%$.
Unfortunately, this level of accuracy is not good enough to measure slopes at
the level required to distinguish between cusps and cores of the type predicted
in viable SIDM models without stronger priors. However, we find that this
provides good enough accuracy to distinguish between the normalization
differences predicted at small radii ($r \simeq r_{-2} < r_{\rm core}$) for
interesting SIDM models. As the number of galaxies with internal proper motions
increases, mass estimators of this kind will enable valuable constraints on
SIDM and CDM models.

we give an explicit description of the convex hull of this nonconvex set in
terms of the generalized eigenvalues of an associated matrix pencil. This
result may be of interest in building relaxations for nonconvex quadratic
programs. Moreover, this result allows us to reformulate the GTRS as the
minimization of two convex quadratic functions in the original space. Our next
set of contributions is algorithmic: we present an algorithm for solving the
GTRS up to an epsilon additive error based on this reformulation. We carefully
handle numerical issues that arise from inexact generalized eigenvalue and
eigenvector computations and establish explicit running time guarantees for
these algorithms. Notably, our algorithms run in linear (in the size of the

solution has a slightly-improved running time dependence on epsilon over the

solving the GTRS lies in solving a generalized eigenvalue problem --
establishing a natural connection between these problems. Finally,

$A_{UU}^{\cos\phi_h}$, $A_{UU}^{\cos2\phi_h}$ and $A_{LU}^{\sin\phi_h}$. The
first two are particularly important since they carry information on the
intrinsic transverse momentum $\vec{k}_T$ of the quarks and on the correlations
between the quark spin and $\vec{k}_T$, expressed by the Boer-Mulders TMD PDFs.
They show strong kinematic dependence as a function of the Bjorken variable
$x$, of the fraction of virtual photon energy carried by the hadron $z$ and of
the component $P_{hT}$ of the hadron momentum orthogonal to the virtual photon
direction, thus confirming the results of previous measurements. Also, as was
recently shown by COMPASS, hadrons coming from decay of diffractively produced
vector mesons give significant contribution to the amplitudes in certain
kinematic regions, explaining in part the kinematic dependencies and helping

semiconductor intellectual Property (IP) from the untrusted entities in the
design and fabrication process. Logic locking hides the functionality of the IP
by embedding additional key-gates in the circuit. The correct output of the
chip is produced, once the correct key value is available at the input of the
key-gates. The confidentiality of the key is imperative for the security of the
locked IP as it stands as the lone barrier against IP infringement. Therefore,
the logic locking is considered as a broken scheme once the key value is
exposed. The research community has shown the vulnerability of the logic
locking techniques against different classes of attacks, such as Oracle-guided
and physical attacks. Although several countermeasures have already been
proposed against such attacks, none of them is simultaneously impeccable
against Oracle-guided, Oracle-less, and physical attacks. Under such
circumstances, a defense-in-depth approach can be considered as a practical
approach in addressing the vulnerabilities of logic locking. Defense-in-depth
is a multilayer defense approach where several independent countermeasures are
implemented in the device to provide aggregated protection against different
attack vectors. Introducing such a multilayer defense model in logic locking is
the major contribution of this paper. With regard to this, we first identify
the core components of logic locking schemes, which need to be protected.
Afterwards, we categorize the vulnerabilities of core components according to
potential threats for the locking key in logic locking schemes. Furthermore, we
propose several defense layers and countermeasures to protect the device from
those vulnerabilities. Finally, we turn our focus to open research questions
and conclude with suggestions for future research directions.

this elusive baryon component. We report on observations of one of the
brightest X-ray sources at a high redshift, RBS 315 (z=2.69). Despite several

its spectrum, whether absorption or intrinsic, could be reached. We present
observations by XMM-Newton (EPIC and RGS) as well as NuSTAR and Swift/XRT. The
XMM-Newton spectra of this source are of unprecedented quality. A purely
statistical analysis of the CCD spectra yields no clear results - the spectrum
is as likely to be photo-electrically absorbed as it is to be curved at the
source, and no constraint on the position of the absorber can be obtained.
Assuming absorption governs the spectral curvature, the lack of absorption
lines in the grating spectra indicates the absorber is not well localized in
redshift space, and could be dispersed over the cosmological scales of the IGM.
Intrinsic curvature, however, can not be unambiguously ruled out.

by the remote sensing community. Classification and segmentation of such
imagery help understand the underlying materials within a scanned scene, since
hyperspectral images convey a detailed information captured in a number of
spectral bands. Although deep learning has established the state of the art in
the field, it still remains challenging to train well-generalizing models due
to the lack of ground-truth data. In this letter, we tackle this problem and
propose an end-to-end approach to segment hyperspectral images in a fully
unsupervised way. We introduce a new deep architecture which couples 3D
convolutional autoencoders with clustering. Our multi-faceted experimental
study---performed over benchmark and real-life data---revealed that our
approach delivers high-quality segmentation without any prior class labels.

effective in $L^2(\mathbb{T},\mu)$, it has a Parseval frame associated via the

of measures $\mu$ which reproduce a kernel contained in a model subspace. We
completely characterize this set when the kernel is the reproducing kernel of a

  Gaussian Model",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG math.PR math.SP math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph matching aims at finding the vertex correspondence between two
unlabeled graphs that maximizes the total edge weight correlation. This amounts
to solving a computationally intractable quadratic assignment problem. In this
paper we propose a new spectral method, GRAph Matching by Pairwise
eigen-Alignments (GRAMPA). Departing from prior spectral approaches that only
compare top eigenvectors, or eigenvectors of the same order, GRAMPA first
constructs a similarity matrix as a weighted sum of outer products between all
pairs of eigenvectors of the two graphs, with weights given by a Cauchy kernel
applied to the separation of the corresponding eigenvalues, then outputs a
matching by a simple rounding procedure. The similarity matrix can also be
interpreted as the solution to a regularized quadratic programming relaxation
of the quadratic assignment problem.
  For the Gaussian Wigner model in which two complete graphs on $n$ vertices
have Gaussian edge weights with correlation coefficient $1-\sigma^2$, we show
that GRAMPA exactly recovers the correct vertex correspondence with high
probability when $\sigma = O(\frac{1}{\log n})$. This matches the state of the
art of polynomial-time algorithms, and significantly improves over existing
spectral methods which require $\sigma$ to be polynomially small in $n$. The
superiority of GRAMPA is also demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real
datasets, in terms of both statistical accuracy and computational efficiency.
Universality results, including similar guarantees for dense and sparse
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs, are deferred to the companion paper.

standard gate-based approach that periodically entangles and measures
additional ancilla qubits. However, the noisy analog signals from continuous
parity measurements mandate more complicated signal processing to interpret
syndromes accurately. We analyze the performance of several practical filtering
methods for continuous error correction and demonstrate that they are viable
alternatives to the standard ancilla-based approach. As an optimal filter, we
discuss an unnormalized (linear) Bayesian filter, with improved computational
efficiency compared to the related Wonham filter introduced by Mabuchi [New J.
Phys. 11, 105044 (2009)]. We compare this optimal continuous filter to two
practical variations of the simplest periodic boxcar-averaging-and-thresholding
filter, targeting real-time hardware implementations with low-latency
circuitry. As variations, we introduce a non-Markovian ``half-boxcar'' filter
and a Markovian filter with a second adjustable threshold; these filters
eliminate the dominant source of error in the boxcar filter, and compare
favorably to the optimal filter. For each filter, we derive analytic results
for the decay in average fidelity and verify them with numerical simulations.

  60th Annual Meeting, July 14-18, 2019, Palm Desert, California USA",,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Numerous experimental efforts have shown that antineutrino-based monitoring
provides a non-intrusive means to estimate the fissile content and relative
thermal power of nuclear reactors for nonproliferation. Until now, there have
been no experimental demonstrations dedicated to exploring the nonproliferation
potential of large detectors required for long-range monitoring. The goal of
the Advanced Instrumentation Testbed (AIT) program is to test novel methods for
the discovery of reactor cores, specifically in the mid-field to far-field,
beyond 200 meters and out to tens or hundreds of kilometers, using
kiloton-scale to megaton-scale detectors. The main physical infrastructure of
the AIT consists of an underground laboratory in the Boulby mine in Northern
England. The site is located at a 26-km standoff from the Hartlepool Reactor
Complex, which houses two 1.5-GWth advanced gas-cooled reactors. The first
detector to be deployed at the AIT is the WATer CHerenkov Monitor of
ANtineutrinos (WATCHMAN). WATCHMAN will use ~6,000 tons of gadolinium-doped
water in order to detect a few reactor antineutrinos per week from the
Hartlepool reactor complex. WATCHMAN will focus on understanding the signal
efficiency, radiological backgrounds, and the reactor operational status. Here,
the nonproliferation goals are to understand the sensitivity for discovery of
one reactor in the presence of another, the discovery of any reactor operations
above a well-understood background, and the sensitivity to confirm the declared
operational cycles of both reactors. Uniquely, AIT-WATCHMAN also offers a
flexible platform at which nascent technologies such as water-based
scintillator and fast photomultiplier tubes can be tested in real-world
conditions. We present the AIT-WATCHMAN program and status.

relationships between variables. They have been proven useful in a wide variety
of fields such as epidemiology, economics and sociology. The interest in using
these models is that they are able to capture context-specific independencies,
relationships that provide richer structure to the model. Many approaches exist
for automatic learning of the independence structure of log-linear models from
data. The methods for evaluating these approaches, however, are limited, and
are mostly based on indirect measures of the complete density of the
probability distribution. Such computation requires additional learning of the
numerical parameters of the distribution, which introduces distortions when
used for comparing structures. This work addresses this issue by presenting the
first measure for the direct and efficient comparison of independence
structures of log-linear models. Our method relies only on the independence
structure of the models, which is useful when the interest lies in obtaining
knowledge from said structure, or when comparing the performance of structure
learning algorithms, among other possible uses. We present proof that the
measure is a metric, and a method for its computation that is efficient in the
number of variables of the domain.

convolution for the pyramid pooling module and decoder, which dramatically
reduces the number of operations while maintaining the performance. Moreover,
we also extend our framework to video action segmentation by adding an extra

the isotope ratios in center retention-time segments were the closest to

drift either up or down a concentration gradient of their substrate.
Observations of these phenomena, termed enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED) and
enzyme chemotaxis, respectively, lead to a novel view of enzymes as active
matter. Enzyme chemotaxis and EED may be important in biology, and they could
have practical applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology. They also are
of considerable biophysical interest; indeed, their physical mechanisms are
still quite uncertain. This review provides an analytic summary of experimental
studies of these phenomena and of the mechanisms that have been proposed to
explain them, and offers a perspective of future directions for the field.

the problem of enforcing population distribution constraints on a population of

research demonstrates that the constraints on the players' population
distribution can be satisfied by enforcing tolls. However, computing the
minimum toll value for constraint satisfaction requires accurate modeling of
the player's congestion costs. Motivated by settings where an accurate
congestion cost model is unavailable (e.g. transportation networks), we
consider an MDP congestion game with unknown congestion costs. We assume that a
constraint-enforcing authority can repeatedly enforce tolls on a population of
players who converges to an $\epsilon$-optimal population distribution for any
given toll. We then construct a myopic update algorithm to compute the minimum
toll value while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied on average. We
analyze how the players' sub-optimal responses to tolls impact the rates of
convergence towards the minimum toll value and constraint satisfaction.
Finally, we construct a congestion game model for Uber drivers in Manhattan,

The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) database. The experiments showed a Dice
coefficient (DC) of 0.891 +/- 0.016 (mean +/- std) and an average symmetric
surface distance (ASD) of 0.994 +/- 0.230 mm over 19 muscles in the set of 20

correlation between the pixels with high uncertainty and the segmentation
failure. One application of the uncertainty metric in active-learning is
demonstrated, and the proposed query pixel selection method considerably
reduced the manual annotation cost for expanding the training data set. The
proposed method allows an accurate patient-specific analysis of individual

mitigation of the effects of the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) from

in the pulse profiles and scale strongly with the inverse of the radio
frequency. Low-frequency observations are therefore highly appealing for
characterizing them. However, in order to achieve the necessary time resolution
to resolve profile features of short-period millisecond pulsars, phase-coherent
de-dispersion is essential, especially at frequencies below $300$ MHz. We
present the lowest-frequency ($80$-$220$ MHz), coherently de-dispersed
detections of one of the most promising pulsars for current and future PTAs,
PSR J2241$-$5236, using our new beam-former software for the MWA's voltage
capture system (VCS), which reconstructs the time series at a much higher time
resolution of $\sim 1 \mu$s by re-synthesizing the recorded voltage data at
$10$-kHz/$100$-$\mu$s native resolutions. Our data reveal a dual-precursor type
feature in the pulse profile that is either faint or absent in high-frequency
observations from Parkes. The resultant high-fidelity detections have enabled
dispersion measure (DM) determinations with very high precision, of the order
of $(2$-$6)\times10^{-6}$ $\rm pc\,cm^{-3}$, owing to the microsecond level
timing achievable for this pulsar at the MWA's low frequencies. This
underscores the usefulness of low-frequency observations for probing the ISM
toward PTA pulsars and informing optimal observing strategies for PTA
experiments.

varies with time due to charge accumulation at a capacitive interface, as well

the potential in the medium. Over time, however, the non-uniform current
density causes spatially varying rate of the charge accumulation at the

via the algorithm of iterative fast Fourier transformations (FFTs) and their
inverse. The least identification resolution is restricted by the peak
identification threshold of the algorithm, and thus the time offset calculation
precision is limited. In this paper, an improvement for the identification is
presented both in the resolution and precision via a modified algorithm of
direct cross correlation extraction. A flexible resolution down to 1 ps is
realized, which is only dependent on the Least Significant Bit (LSB) resolution
of the time-tagging device. The attainable precision is shown mainly determined
by the inherent timing jitter of the single photon detectors, the acquired pair
rate and acquisition time, and a sub picosecond precision (0.72 ps) has been
achieved at an acquisition time of 4.5 s. This high-precision nonlocal

due to the presence of a blunt body in a flowing medium. Numerical simulations
have shown that the phenomenon of vortex shedding could also develop in the
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) domain. The dimensionless Strouhal number, the ratio
of the blunt body diameter to the product of the period of vortex shedding and
the speed of a flowing medium, is a robust indicator for vortex shedding, and,
generally of the order of 0.2 for a wide range of Reynolds number. Using an
observation from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics

against the Sun's gravitational force. A newly formed shrinking loop in the

One of the most popular regularization algorithms is to impose L-2 penalty on

determined in proportional to the magnitude of its gradient using the sigmoid

collisionless, and it is mediated by the Weibel instability which generates the

downstream region is much stronger than the shock-compressed pre-shock field.
However, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic shocks propagating
into homogeneous media show that the Weibel generated field decays near the
shock front. Some GRB observations and theoretical studies suggest that the
preshock medium is inhomogeneous. We perform the PIC simulation of a
relativistic shock propagating into inhomogeneous plasma. It is found that the
post-shock magnetic field decays slowly compared with the homogeneous case.
Sound waves and entropy waves are also generated by the shock-wave interaction,
and temperature anisotropy is produced by the sound wave in the downstream
region. The free energy of the temperature anisotropy is large enough to
explain the observed field strength. Our results show that the upstream density
fluctuation has a significant effect in the downstream region of collisionless
shocks even if the wavelength of the upstream inhomogeneity is much larger than

waveform generation module in many different voice conversion frameworks and
achieves significant improvement over conventional vocoders. However, because
of the fixed dilated convolution and generic network architecture, the WN
vocoder lacks robustness against unseen input features and often requires a
huge network size to achieve acceptable speech quality. Such limitations
usually lead to performance degradation in the voice conversion task. To
overcome this problem, the QPNet vocoder is applied, which includes a
pitch-dependent dilated convolution component to enhance the pitch
controllability and attain a more compact network than the WN vocoder. In the
proposed method, input spectral features are first converted using a framewise
deep neural network, and then the QPNet vocoder generates converted speech
conditioned on the linearly converted prosodic and transformed spectral
features. The experimental results confirm that the QPNet vocoder achieves
significantly better performance than the same-size WN vocoder while
maintaining comparable speech quality to the double-size WN vocoder. Index

far, because the critical regularity cannot control all non linear coupling
terms. In this paper, we pose an additional regularity assumption of low
frequencies in $\mathbb{R}^d(d\geq 3)$, and then the sharp time-weighted
inequality can be established, which leads to the time-decay estimates of
global strong solutions in the $L^{p}$ critical Besov spaces. Precisely, we
show that if the initial data belong to some Besov space
$\dot{B}^{-s_{1}}_{2,\infty}$ with $s_{1}\in (1-\frac{d}{2}, s_0](s_0\triangleq
\frac{2d}{p}-\frac{d}{2})$, then the $L^{p}$ norm of the critical global
solutions admits the time decay
$t^{-\frac{s_{1}}{2}-\frac{d}{2}(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p})}$ (in particular,
$t^{-\frac{d}{2p}}$ if $s_1=s_0$), which coincides with that of heat kernel in

quantify and visualize the contribution of individual features towards the
original data. Also, the reduced features and reversibility naturally endure
the proposed system ability of data compression. This system can significantly
compress data with a small percent deviation between the compressed and the
original data. At the same time, when the compressed data is used for
classification, it still achieves high testing accuracy. Furthermore, we
observe that the extracted features of the proposed system can be approximated

estimation and detection can be applied for classification. This motivates us
to propose using a MAP (maximum a posteriori) based classification method. As a
result, the extracted features and the corresponding performance have

that the proposed classification system not only enjoys significant reduced

globally protected against local perturbations. Dissipationless topologically
protected states are thus of major fundamental interest as well as of practical
importance in metrology and quantum information technology. Although
topological protection can be robust theoretically, in realistic devices it is
often fragile against various dissipative mechanisms, which are difficult to
probe directly because of their microscopic origins. By utilizing scanning
nanothermometry, we visualize and investigate microscopic mechanisms
undermining the apparent topological protection in the quantum Hall state in
graphene. Our simultaneous nanoscale thermal and scanning gate microscopy shows
that the dissipation is governed by crosstalk between counterpropagating pairs
of downstream and upstream channels that appear at graphene boundaries because
of edge reconstruction. Instead of local Joule heating, however, the
dissipation mechanism comprises two distinct and spatially separated processes.
The work generating process that we image directly and which involves elastic
tunneling of charge carriers between the quantum channels, determines the
transport properties but does not generate local heat. The independently
visualized heat and entropy generation process, in contrast, occurs nonlocally
upon inelastic resonant scattering off single atomic defects at graphene edges,
while not affecting the transport. Our findings offer a crucial insight into
the mechanisms concealing the true topological protection and suggest venues
for engineering more robust quantum states for device applications.

classification step removes the trials which were mis-classified or had a low
probability of occurrence to extract only reliable EEG trials. Through our

is shown that for two dielectric (SiO_2) plates, as well as for one dielectric

branching phase spaces. Their singularity structure is identical to that of
initial-final (IF) antennae in $2\to N$ hard processes (once mass terms
associated with the incoming legs are allowed for), but the phase-space
factorisations are different. The consequent radiation patterns respect QCD
coherence (at leading colour) and reduce to
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi and eikonal kernels in the
respective collinear and soft limits. The main novelty in the phase-space
factorisation is that branchings in RF antennae impart a collective recoil to
the other partons within the same decay system. An explicit implementation of
these ideas, based on the Sudakov veto algorithm, is provided in the VINCIA

classical regularization approaches in the parameter space are rendered

regularization significantly and consistently outperforms other regularization
methods across seven data sets and three CDE models. The effectiveness of noise

has become increasingly important for numerous applications in both cloud

driverless car). FPGA-based DNN accelerators have demonstrated both superior
flexibility and performance; in addition, for real-time inference with low
batch size, FPGA is expected to achieve further performance improvement.
However, the performance gain from the single-FPGA design is obstructed by the
limited on-chip resource. In this paper, we employ multiple FPGAs to
cooperatively run DNNs with the objective of achieving super-linear speed-up
against single-FPGA design. In implementing such systems, we found two barriers
that hinder us from achieving the design goal: (1) the lack of a clear
partition scheme for each DNN layer to fully exploit parallelism, and (2) the
insufficient bandwidth between the off-chip memory and the accelerator due to
the growing size of DNNs. To tackle these issues, we propose a general
framework, ""Super-LIP"", which can support different kinds of DNNs. In this
paper, we take Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a vehicle to illustrate
Super-LIP. We first formulate an accurate system-level model to support the
exploration of best partition schemes. Then, we develop a novel design
methodology to effectively alleviate the heavy loads on memory bandwidth by
moving traffic from memory bus to inter-FPGA links. We implement Super-LIP
based on ZCU102 FPGA boards. Results demonstrate that Super-LIP with 2 FPGAs
can achieve 3.48x speedup, compared to the state-of-the-art single-FPGA design.
What is more, as the number of FPGAs scales up, the system latency can be
further reduced while maintaining high energy efficiency.

particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 um (PM2.5), is crucial for
improving public health. Reliable information on the concentration, size
distribution and chemical characteristics of PMs is key to evaluating air
pollution and identifying its sources. Standard methods for PM2.5
characterization require sample collection from the atmosphere and
post-analysis using sophisticated equipment in a laboratory environment, and
are normally very time-consuming. Although optical methods based on analysis of
scattering of free-space laser beams or evanescent fields are in principle
suitable for real-time particle counting and sizing, lack of knowledge of the
refractive index in these methods not only leads to inevitable sizing ambiguity
but also prevents identification of the particle material. In the case of
evanescent wave detection, the system lifetime is strongly limited by adhesion
of particles to the surfaces. Here we report a novel technique for airborne
particle metrology based on hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. It offers in
situ particle counting, sizing and refractive index measurement with
effectively unlimited device lifetime, and relies on optical forces that
automatically capture airborne particles in front of the hollow core and propel
them into the fibre. The resulting transmission drop, together with the
time-of-flight of the particles passing through the fibre, provide unambiguous
mapping of particle size and refractive index with high accuracy. The technique
represents a considerable advance over currently available real-time particle
metrology systems, and can be directly applied to monitoring air pollution in
the open atmosphere as well as precise particle characterization in a local

Suppliers, with uncertain yield, announce wholesale prices, while retailers

Subsequently, retailers compete with each other in Cournot fashion to sell the

their links among too few suppliers, i.e., there is insufficient

these two ways of improving service have qualitatively different effects on

data-driven/machine learning based multi-level spectrum sensing scheme,
including the spectrum learning (Stage I) and prediction (the first part in

of the PT power characteristics. Then, based on a novel normalized power level
alignment metric, we propose two prediction-transmission structures, namely
periodic and non-periodic, for spectrum access (the second part in Stage II),
which enable the secondary transmitter (ST) to closely follow the PT power
level variation. The periodic structure features a fixed prediction interval,
while the non-periodic one dynamically determines the interval with a proposed
reinforcement learning algorithm to further improve the alignment metric.
Finally, we extend the prediction-transmission structure to an online scenario,
where the number of PT power levels might change as a consequence of PT
adapting to the environment fluctuation or quality of service variation. The
simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in
various scenarios.

The answer may help
investors realize upsides to using each model, act as a segue for investors
into more complex financial analysis and machine learning, and to increase
financial literacy amongst students. Creating original versions of popular
models, like linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, and moving average
crossovers, we can test how each model performs on the most popular stocks and
largest indexes. With the results for each, we can compare the models, and
understand which model reliably increases performance. The trials showed that
while all three models reduced losses on stocks with strong overall downward
trends, the two machine learning models did not work as well to increase
profits. Moving averages crossovers outperformed a continuous investment every
time, although did result in a more volatile investment as well. Furthermore,
once finished creating the program that implements moving average crossover,
what are the optimal periods to use? A massive test consisting of 169,880
trials, showed the best periods to use to increase investment performance
(5,10) and to decrease volatility (33,44). In addition, the data showed
numerous trends such as a smaller short SMA period is accompanied by higher
performance. Plotting volatility against performance shows that the high risk,
high reward saying holds true and shows that for investments, as the volatility
increases so does its performance.

deployments of phasor measurement units (PMUs), massive amounts of
synchrophasor measurements are collected, which makes it possible for the
real-time situation awareness of the entire system. In this paper, based on
random matrix theory (RMT), a data-driven approach is proposed for anomaly
detection in power systems. First, spatio-temporal data set is formulated by
arranging high-dimensional synchrophasor measurements in chronological order.
Based on the Ring Law in RMT for the empirical spectral analysis of
`signal+noise' matrix, the mean spectral radius (MSR) is introduced to indicate
the system states from the macroscopic perspective. In order to realize anomaly
declare automatically, an anomaly indicator based on the MSR is designed and
the corresponding confidence level $1-\alpha$ is calculated. The proposed
approach is capable of detecting the anomaly in an early phase and robust
against random fluctuations and measuring errors. Cases on the synthetic data
generated from IEEE 300-bus, 118-bus and 57-bus test systems validate the
effectiveness and advantages of the approach.

past few decades it has been found that many extreme environments are inhabited
by organisms known as extremophiles.Knowledge of their emergence, adaptability,
and limitations seems to provide a guideline for the search of
extra-terrestrial life, since some extremophiles presumably can survive in
extreme environments such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus. Due to
physicochemical constraints, the first life necessarily came into existence at
the lower limit of lifes conceivable complexity.Thus, the first life could not
have been an extremophile, furthermore, since biological evolution occurs over
time, then the dual knowledge regarding what specific extremophiles are capable
of, and to the analogue environment on extreme worlds, will not be sufficient
as a search criterion.This is because, even though an extremophile can live in
an extreme environment here-and-now, its ancestor however could not live in
that very same environment in the past, which means that no contemporary
extremophiles exist in that environment.Furthermore, a theoretical framework
should be able to predict whether extremophiles can be considered a special or
general case in the galaxy.Thus, a question is raised: does Earths continuous
inhabitability represent an extreme or average value for planets? Thus,
dependent on whether it is difficult or easy for worlds to maintain this
inhabitability, the search for extra-terrestrial life with a focus on
extremophiles will either represent a search after dying worlds, or a search
after special life on living worlds, where one focus too narrowly on extreme

submatching using derivatives with an approach inspired by Laurikari and his

to keep some of their connections protected or private. Motivated by this
observation, our goal is to design a differentially private LP algorithm, which
trades off between privacy of the protected node-pairs and the link prediction
accuracy. More specifically, we first propose a form of differential privacy on
graphs, which models the privacy loss only of those node-pairs which are marked
as protected. Next, we develop DPLP , a learning to rank algorithm, which
applies a monotone transform to base scores from a non-private LP system, and
then adds noise. DPLP is trained with a privacy induced ranking loss, which
optimizes the ranking utility for a given maximum allowed level of privacy
leakage of the protected node-pairs. Under a recently-introduced latent node

Extensive experiments with several real-life graphs and several LP heuristics

duration. Our algorithm uses iteratively computed Lagrangian multipliers as
constraint weights to augment the greedy algorithm for the multidimensional
knapsack problem and uses that information in a greedy crossover in a genetic
algorithm. The algorithm uses several other hyperparameters which can be set in
the code to control convergence. Our algorithm improves upon the algorithm by
Chu and Beasley in that it converges to optimum or near optimum solutions much
faster.
