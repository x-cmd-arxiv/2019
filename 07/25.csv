convergence rate of a class of first-order algorithms involving inertial
features. They can be interpreted as discrete time versions of inertial
dynamics involving both viscous and Hessian-driven dampings. The geometrical
damping driven by the Hessian intervenes in the dynamics in the form $\nabla^2
f (x(t)) \dot{x} (t)$. By treating this term as the time derivative of $ \nabla
f (x (t)) $, this gives, in discretized form, first-order algorithms in time
and space. In addition to the convergence properties attached to Nesterov-type
accelerated gradient methods, the algorithms thus obtained are new and show a
rapid convergence towards zero of the gradients. On the basis of a
regularization technique using the Moreau envelope, we extend these methods to
non-smooth convex functions with extended real values. The introduction of time
scale factors makes it possible to further accelerate these algorithms. We also
report numerical results on structured problems to support our theoretical
findings.

Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of a variety of DFT formalisms and

the atomic positions towards the bulk. Based on an intensive computational
study, we show that GGA with vdW treatment is the most appropriate method for
structural optimization. Electronic structures derived from GGA or metaGGA
employing experimental lattice parameters are also acceptable. In this regard,
we express a slight preference for metaGGA in terms of accuracy, but an overall

transmission expansion planning (TEP) add to the problem's complexity. Even if
the power flow equations are linearized, the optimization problem is still
bilinear and mixed-integer due to the dependence of line expansion on line
impedance and a discrete set of line expansion options. While it is possible to
linearize this mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) by applying a big-M
disjunctive relaxation, the resulting MILP is still hard to solve using
state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale energy system models. In this paper we
therefore develop heuristics to incorporate integer transmission expansion and
responsive line impedances in energy system models, while retaining the lower
computational effort of continuous linear programming (LP) by applying
sequential linear programming (SLP) techniques, relaxation and discretization
approaches. We benchmark their performance against the results of the exact

surrogate modeling. Kernel methods have proven to be efficient in machine
learning, pattern recognition and signal analysis due to their flexibility,
excellent experimental performance and elegant functional analytic background.
These data-based techniques provide so called kernel expansions, i.e., linear
combinations of kernel functions which are generated from given input-output
point samples that may be arbitrarily scattered. In particular, these
techniques are meshless, do not require or depend on a grid, hence are less
prone to the curse of dimensionality, even for high-dimensional problems.
  In contrast to projection-based model reduction, we do not necessarily assume
a high-dimensional model, but a general function that models input-output
behavior within some simulation context. This could be some micro-model in a
multiscale-simulation, some submodel in a coupled system, some initialization
function for solvers, coefficient function in PDEs, etc.
  First, kernel surrogates can be useful if the input-output function is
expensive to evaluate, e.g. is a result of a finite element simulation. Here,
acceleration can be obtained by sparse kernel expansions. Second, if a function
is available only via measurements or a few function evaluation samples, kernel
approximation techniques can provide function surrogates that allow global
evaluation.
  We present some important kernel approximation techniques, which are kernel
interpolation, greedy kernel approximation and support vector regression.
Pseudo-code is provided for ease of reproducibility. In order to illustrate the
main features, commonalities and differences, we compare these techniques on a
real-world application. The experiments clearly indicate the enormous
acceleration potential

paths. Knowing the angular information of their dominant paths, we can develop
various applications, such as the prediction of link performance and the
tracking of an 802.11ad device. Although they are equipped with phased arrays,
the angular inference for 802.11ad devices is still challenging due to their
limited number of RF chains and limited phase control capabilities. Considering
the beam sweeping operation and the high communication bandwidth of 802.11ad
devices, we propose variation-based angle estimation (VAE), called VAE-CIR, by
utilizing beam-specific channel impulse responses (CIRs) measured under
different beams and the directional gains of the corresponding beams to infer
the angular information of dominant paths. Unlike state-of-the-arts, VAE-CIR
exploits the variations between different beam-specific CIRs, instead of their
absolute values, for angular inference. To evaluate the performance of VAE-CIR,
we generate the beam-specific CIRs by simulating the beam sweeping of 802.11ad
devices with the beam patterns measured on off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices. The
60GHz channel is generated via a ray-tracing simulator and the CIRs are
extracted via channel estimation based on Golay sequences. Through experiments
in various scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VAE-CIR and its
superiority to existing angular inference schemes for 802.11ad devices.

develop an estimation method that quantifies the discretization error based on

technical level, the simple linear regression model is a five-parameter model.
It is natural to base sample size calculations on the least squares' estimator
of the slope parameter of the model. Nuisance parameters such as the variance
of the predictor X and conditional variance of the response Y create problems
in the calculations. The current approaches in the literature are not
illuminating. One approach is based on the conditional distribution of the
estimator of the slope parameter given the data on the predictor X. Another
approach is based on the sample correlation coefficient. We overcome the
problems by determining the exact unconditional distribution of the test
statistic built on the estimator of the slope parameter. The exact
unconditional distribution alleviates difficulties to some extent in the
computation of sample sizes. On the other hand, the test based on the sample
correlation coefficient of X and Y avoids the problems besetting the test based
on the slope parameter. However, we lose intuitive interpretation that comes
with the slope parameter. Surprisingly, we see that the sample size that comes
from the correlation test works in synchronization with the one that comes from
the test built upon the slope parameter in a broad array of settings.

each body imparts on the other. We also consider the influence of the
$J_2$-related secular terms on the orbital evolution and the torque, caused by
the triaxiality, on the rotational evolution, both of which are associated only
to one of the bodies. We apply these set of equations to the study of the
orbital and rotational evolution of a binary system composed of a rocky planet
and its host star in order to characterize the dynamical evolution at work,
particularly near spin-orbit resonances. We used the equations of motion that
give the time evolution of the orbital elements and the spin rates of each body
to study the time evolution of the Kepler-21 system as an example of how the
formalism that we have developed can be applied. We obtained a set of equations
of motion without singularities for vanishing eccentricities and inclinations.
This set gives, on one hand, the time evolution of the orbital elements due to
the tidal potentials generated by both members of the system as well as the
triaxiality of one of them. On the other hand, it gives the time evolution of
the stellar spin rate due to the corresponding tidal torque and of the planet's
rotation angle due to both the tidal and triaxiality-induced torques. We found
that for the parameters and the initial conditions explored here, the tidally

This model is intuitively inspired by the one teacher vs. multiple students
learning method typically employed in schools. In particular, our model
contains a single teacher-student distillation module and a student-student
knowledge sharing mechanism. The former is designed using a tracking-specific
distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from a teacher to students. The
latter is utilized for mutual learning between students to enable in-depth
knowledge understanding. Extensive empirical evaluations on several popular

Moreover, the results on five tracking benchmarks show that the proposed

transport rate at the boundaries. In addition, we derive new expressions for
helicity transport due to flux emergence/submergence versus photospheric

lamellar electric field produced by the surface potential transports helicity
across boundaries, and the solenoidal electric field produced by a surface

[Fe/H], [X/Fe] and ages, along with orbits, for red clump stars from the APOGEE

observational evidence that metallicity ([Fe/H]) and age are informative about
a star's orbit, e.g. about its angular momentum and the corresponding mean
Galactocentric distance or its vertical motion. Indeed, our analysis of the
APOGEE data confirms that [Fe/H] or age alone can predict the stars' orbits far
less well than the combination of the two. Remarkably, we find and show
explicitly, that for known [Fe/H] and age, the other abundances [X/Fe] of
Galactic disk stars can be predicted well (on average to 0.02 dex) across a
wide range of Galactocentric radii, and therefore provide little additional
information, e.g. for predicting their orbit. While the age-abundance space for
metal poor stars and potentially for stars near the Galactic center is rich or
complex, for the bulk of the Galaxy's low-$\alpha$ disk it is simple: [Fe/H]
and age contain most information, unless [X/Fe] can be measured to 0.02, or
better. Consequently, we do not have the precision with current (and likely
near-future) data to assign stars to their individual (coeval) birth clusters,
from which the disk is presumably formed. We can, however, place strong

increasingly biased towards tangential motions inside the core. However, the
tangential bias is less than in other cored elliptical galaxies. We compare
Holm 15A with N-body simulations of mergers between galaxies with black holes

remnant of a merger between two ETGs with pre-existing depleted cores. We find
that black hole masses in cored galaxies, including Holm 15A, scale inversely

In a stark contrast, here we report that Weyl points in systems symmetric under
the composition of time-reversal with a $\pi$-rotation are characterized by a
non-Abelian topological invariant. The topological charges of the Weyl points
are transformed via braid phase factors which arise upon exchange inside
symmetric planes of the reciprocal momentum space. We elucidate this process
with an elementary two-dimensional tight-binding model implementable in
cold-atoms setups and in photonic systems. In three dimensions, interplay of
the non-Abelian topology with point-group symmetry is shown to enable
topological phase transitions in which pairs of Weyl points may scatter or
convert into nodal-line rings. By combining our theoretical arguments with
first-principles calculations, we predict that Weyl points occurring near the
Fermi level of zirconium telluride ($\textrm{ZrTe}$) carry non-trivial values
of the non-Abelian charge, and that uniaxial compression strain drives a
non-trivial conversion of the Weyl points into nodal lines.

production of neutral $B$ mesons at MeV temperatures in the early Universe,
which undergo CP-violating oscillations and subsequently decay into a dark
sector. In this work, we discuss the consequences of realizing this mechanism
in a supersymmetric model with an unbroken $U(1)_R$ symmetry which is
identified with baryon number. $B$ mesons decay into a dark sector through a
baryon number conserving operator mediated by TeV scale squarks and a GeV scale

and their superpartners in a type-I seesaw framework for neutrino masses. The
sterile sneutrinos are sufficiently long lived and constitute the dark matter.
The produced matter-antimatter asymmetry is directly related to observables
measurable at $B$ factories and hadron colliders, the most relevant of which
are the semileptonic-leptonic asymmetries in neutral $B$ meson systems and the
inclusive branching fraction of $B$ mesons into hadrons and missing energy. We
discuss model independent constraints on these experimental observables before
quoting predictions made in the supersymmetric context. Constraints from
astrophysics, neutrino physics and flavor observables are studied, as are
potential LHC signals with a focus on novel long lived particle searches which
are directly linked to properties of the dark sector.

once thought. The dynamics of a scalar field in inflationary universe can
produce PBHs under mild assumptions regarding the scalar potential. In the
early universe, light scalar fields develop large expectation values during
inflation and subsequently relax to the minimum of the effective potential at a
later time. During the relaxation process, an initially homogeneous scalar
condensate can fragment into lumps via an instability similar to the
gravitational (Jeans) instability, where the scalar self-interactions, rather
than gravity, play the leading role. The fragmentation of the scalar field into
lumps (e.g. Q-balls or oscillons) creates matter composed of relatively few
heavy ""particles"", whose distribution is subject to significant fluctuations
unconstrained by comic microwave background (CMB) observations and unrelated to
the large-scale structure. If this matter component comes to temporarily
dominate the energy density before the scalar lumps decay, PBHs can be
efficiently produced during the temporary matter-dominated era. We develop a
general analytic framework for description of PBH formation in this class of
models. We highlight the differences between the scalar fragmentation scenario
and other commonly considered PBH formation models. Given the existence of the
Higgs field and the preponderance of scalar fields within supersymmetric and
other models of new physics, PBHs constitute an appealing and plausible
candidate for dark matter.

the reversal of the arrow of time, recently shown experimentally in [K.
Micadei, et al., Nat. Commun. 10:2456 (2019)], and manifesting itself by a
reversal of the heat flow (from the cold system to the hot one). Here, we show
that contrary to what could have been expected, heat flow reversal can happen
without reversal of the arrow of time. Moreover, contrasting with previous
studies, no initial correlations between system and bath is required. Instead,
the heat flow reversal only relies on internal quantum coherences or
correlations, which provides practical advantages over previous schemes: one
does not need to have access to the bath in order to reverse the heat flow. The
underlying mechanism is explained and shown to stem from the collective
system-bath coupling and the impact of non-energetic coherences (coherences
between degenerate energy levels) on apparent temperatures. The phenomenon is
first uncovered in a broad framework valid for diverse quantum systems
containing energy degeneracy. By the end of the paper, aiming at experimental
realisations, more quantitative results are provided for a pair of two-level
systems. Finally, as a curiosity, we mention that our scheme can be adapted as
a correlations-to-energy converter, which have the particularity to be able to
operate at constant entropy, similarly to ideal work sources.

spectroscopic signs of powerful ionized winds, whereas type 2 quasar candidates
are less luminous and show only mild outflows. After performing careful
subtraction of the quasar light, we clearly detect almost all host galaxies.
The median rest-frame B-band luminosity of the ERQ hosts in our sample is
10^11.2 L_Sun, or 4 L* at this redshift. Two of the ten hosts of ERQs are in
ongoing mergers. The hosts of the type 2 quasar candidates are 0.6 dex less

of interaction and presence of low-mass companions, our objects do not show
nearly as much major merger activity as do high-redshift radio-loud galaxies

merger activity, our observations are consistent with a model in which the
near-Eddington accretion and strong feedback of ERQs are associated with
relatively late stages of mergers resulting in early-type remnants. These

relation is $\sigma_{\chi A} \propto A^2 \mu_A^2 \sigma_{\chi N}\propto A^4

generically fail for dark matter-nucleus cross sections $\sigma_{\chi A} \sim

As in the non-relativistic case, resistivity is essential for the mass loading

extending previous works (Qian et al. 2017, 2018) for larger physical grids,
higher spatial resolution, and longer simulation time. We consider an initially
thin, resistive disk orbiting the black hole, threaded by a large-scale
magnetic flux. As the system evolves, outflows are launched from the black hole
magnetosphere and the disk surface. We mainly focus on disk outflows,
investigating their MHD structure and energy output in comparison with the
Poynting-dominated black hole jet. The disk wind encloses two components -- a
fast component dominated by the toroidal magnetic field and a slower component
dominated by the poloidal field. The disk wind transitions from sub to
super-Alfv\'enic speed, reaching velocities $\simeq 0.1c$. We provide parameter
studies varying spin parameter and resistivity level, and measure the
respective mass and energy fluxes. A higher spin strengthens the
$B_{\phi}$-dominated disk wind along the inner jet. We disentangle a critical
resistivity level that leads to a maximum matter and energy output for both,
resulting from the interplay between re-connection and diffusion, which in
combination govern the magnetic flux and the mass loading. For counter-rotating
black holes the outflow structure shows a magnetic field reversal. We estimate
the opacity of the inner-most accretion stream and the outflow structure around
it. This stream may be critically opaque for a lensed signal, while the axial
jet funnel remains optically thin.

novel implementation of supernova feedback. The results of these simulations
show that gravitationally unstable discs can generate violent supersonic winds
with mass loading factors $\eta \gtrsim 10$, followed by a galactic fountain
phase. These violent winds are generated by highly clustered supernovae
exploding in dense environments created by gravitational instability, and they
are not produced in simulation without self-gravity. The violent winds
significantly perturb the vertical structure of the disc, which is later
re-established during the galactic fountain phase. Gas resettles into a
quasi-steady, highly turbulent disc with volume-weighted velocity dispersion
$\sigma > 50 \, {\rm km/s}$. The new configuration drives weaker galactic winds

a fraction of the internal energy is re-converted into kinetic energy and,
consequently, the two shells survive and remain in the system. We find that in

As this geometric component is not learnt, we call our approach
semi-parametric. In particular, we exploit man-made object symmetry and
piece-wise planarity to integrate rich a-priori visual information into the
novel viewpoint synthesis process. An Image Completion Network (ICN) is then
trained to generate a realistic image starting from this geometric guidance.
This careful blend between parametric and non-parametric components allows us
to i) operate in a real-world scenario, ii) preserve high-frequency visual
information such as textures, iii) handle truly arbitrary 3D roto-translations
of the input and iv) perform shape transfer to completely different 3D models.
Eventually, we show that our approach can be easily complemented with synthetic

spectro-interferometry fringe data to probe the structure of stellar
atmospheres. In a preliminary demonstration, we use both Navy Precision Optical
Interferometer (NPOI) data and stellar atmosphere models to show that this tool
can be used, for example, to investigate limb darkening.
  Using bootstrapping with either multiple linked baselines or multiple
wavelengths in optical and infrared spectro-interferometric observations of
stars makes it possible to measure the spatial frequency $u_0$ at which the
real part of the fringe visibility ${\rm Re}(V)$ vanishes. That spatial
frequency is determined by $u_0 = B_\perp/\lambda_0$, where $B_\perp$ is the
projected baseline length, and $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength at which the null
is observed. Since $B_\perp$ changes with the Earth's rotation, $\lambda_0$
also changes. If $u_0$ is constant with wavelength, $\lambda_0$ varies in
direct proportion to $B_\perp$. Any departure from that proportionality
indicates that the brightness distribution across the stellar disk varies with
wavelength via variations in limb darkening, in the angular size of the disk,
or both.
  In this paper, we introduce the use of variations of $u_0$ with $\lambda$ as
a means of probing the structure of stellar atmospheres. Using the equivalent
uniform disk diameter $\theta_{\rm UD, 0}(\lambda_0)$, given by $\theta_{\rm
UD, 0} = 1.22/u_0(\lambda_0)$, as a convenient and intuitive parameterization
of $u_0(\lambda_0)$, we demonstrate this concept by using model atmospheres to

While they are now still at kiloparsec-scale separations, where the host-galaxy
gravitational potential dominates, the black holes may evolve into a bound
triple system in $\lesssim$2 Gyr. These triple merger systems may explain the
overly massive stellar cores that have been observed in some elliptical
galaxies such as M87, which are expected to be unique gravitational wave
sources. Similar systems may be more common in the early universe, when galaxy
mergers are thought to have been more frequent.

grains trace highly eccentric, apsidally aligned orbits. Apsidal alignment is
surprising, especially for dust. Even when born from an apse-aligned ring of
parent bodies, dust grains have their periastra dispersed in all directions by
stellar radiation pressure. The periastra cannot be re-oriented by planets
within the short dust lifetimes at the bottom of the collisional cascade. We
propose that what re-aligns dust orbits is drag exerted by second-generation
gas. Gas is largely immune to radiation pressure, and when released by
photodesorption or collisions within an eccentric ring of parent bodies should
occupy a similarly eccentric, apse-aligned ring. Dust grains launched onto
misaligned orbits cross the eccentric gas ring supersonically and can become
dragged into alignment within collisional lifetimes. The resultant dust
configurations, viewed nearly but not exactly edge-on, with periastra pointing
away from the observer, appear moth-like, with kinked wings and even doubled
pairs of wings, explaining otherwise mysterious features in HD 61005 (""The
Moth"") and HD 32297, including their central bulbs when we account for strong
forward scattering from irregularly shaped particles. Around these systems we
predict gas at Kuiper-belt-like distances to move on highly elliptical
streamlines that owe their elongation, ultimately, to highly eccentric planets.
Unresolved issues and an alternative explanation for apsidal alignment are
outlined.

a benchmark for commonsense reasoning, is a set of 273 expert-crafted pronoun
resolution problems originally designed to be unsolvable for statistical models
that rely on selectional preferences or word associations. However, recent
advances in neural language models have already reached around 90% accuracy on
variants of WSC. This raises an important question whether these models have
truly acquired robust commonsense capabilities or whether they rely on spurious
biases in the datasets that lead to an overestimation of the true capabilities
of machine commonsense. To investigate this question, we introduce WinoGrande,
a large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the original WSC design, but
adjusted to improve both the scale and the hardness of the dataset. The key
steps of the dataset construction consist of (1) a carefully designed
crowdsourcing procedure, followed by (2) systematic bias reduction using a
novel AfLite algorithm that generalizes human-detectable word associations to
machine-detectable embedding associations. The best state-of-the-art methods on
WinoGrande achieve 59.4-79.1%, which are 15-35% below human performance of
94.0%, depending on the amount of the training data allowed. Furthermore, we
establish new state-of-the-art results on five related benchmarks - WSC
(90.1%), DPR (93.1%), COPA (90.6%), KnowRef (85.6%), and Winogender (97.1%).
These results have dual implications: on one hand, they demonstrate the
effectiveness of WinoGrande when used as a resource for transfer learning. On
the other hand, they raise a concern that we are likely to be overestimating
the true capabilities of machine commonsense across all these benchmarks. We
emphasize the importance of algorithmic bias reduction in existing and future
benchmarks to mitigate such overestimation.

extensive quantitative calculations using classical MD, as well as first
principles quantum chemistry. MD reproduced well the main structural features
and slow motions, and shed light on differences in collective dynamics between
Q-values linked with the $\pi-\pi$ stacking and the lamellar stacking, with the
crystalline phase being the most impacted. On the other hand MD led to a
limited description of molecular vibrations. In this context, first principles
molecular calculations described well the high-energy vibrational features (
$>$ 900 cm$^{-1}$ ), while periodic calculations allowed to better describe the
low- and mid-energy vibrational ranges ( 200-900 cm$^{-1}$ ). The mid-energy
range is predominantly associated with both intra-molecular and inter-molecular
mode coupling, which encloses information about both the polymer conformation
and the polymer packing at short range. One of the outcomes of this study is
the validation of the common assumption made that RRa-P3HT is a good
approximation for the amorphous phase of RR-P3HT at the macroscopic level. The
present work helps to clarify unambiguously the latter point which has been
largely overlooked in the literature. We highlight the importance to complement
optical spectroscopy techniques with inelastic neutron scattering. The latter
offering the advantage of being insensitive to the delocalized $\pi$-electron

observations of N$_2$H$^+$ at 0.2$''$-0.4$''$ resolution in the disks around
LkCa 15, GM Aur, DM Tau, V4046 Sgr, AS 209, and IM Lup. We find two distinctive
emission morphologies: N$_2$H$^+$ is either present in a bright, narrow ring
surrounded by extended tenuous emission, or in a broad ring. These emission
patterns can be explained by two different kinds of vertical temperature
structures. Bright, narrow N$_2$H$^+$ rings are expected in disks with a thick
Vertically Isothermal Region above the Midplane (VIRaM) layer (LkCa 15, GM Aur,

Broad N$_2$H$^+$ rings come from disks with a thin VIRaM layer (V4046 Sgr, AS

snowline pairs and corresponding freeze-out temperatures towards the disks with

hybrid wiretap channel model for formulating achievable secrecy rate and
secrecy outage probability is considered. Additionally, a data set of channel
estimates and measured additive noises obtained from a measurement campaign
carried out in several in-home facilities is used for providing practical
results, which can offer direction for dealing with the security aspects of
broadband in-home PLC systems in the physical layer perspective. The attained
results show high values of secrecy outage probability for all chosen values of
target secrecy rate and total power transmission (practical and theoretical)
when the PLC devices are far from each other and the eavesdropper is close to
the PLC transmitter (i.e., the distance is shorter than 2 meters). Overall, the
numerical results show that the vulnerability of broadband in-home PLC systems,
in terms of PLS, is relevant when practical values of total transmission power
apply. Therefore, a rethinking of the use of unshielded power cables or new

the excess emission at frequencies below 100 GHz which cannot be explained by
thermal dust emission (hereafter anomalous microwave emission-AME). Moreover,
AGB envelopes are a common place where gas molecules condense to form
nanoparticles (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and large grains. In
this paper, we will study whether electric dipole emission from rapidly
spinning nanoparticles can reproduce the AME observed toward AGB stars. To
properly model the size distribution of nanoparticles in the AGB envelope, we
take into account both the increase of nanoparticles due to rotational
disruption of large grains spun-up by radiative torques and the decrease of
smallest nanoparticles due to rotational disruption driven by stochastic gas
collisions. We then perform detailed modeling of microwave emission from
rapidly spinning nanoparticles from both C-rich and O-rich AGB envelopes using
the grain size distribution constrained by rotational disruption. We find that
spinning dust emission is dominant over thermal dust emission at frequencies
below 100 GHz. We attempt to fit the observational data of AME using our
spinning dust model and demonstrate that spinning dust can reproduce the
observed AME in six AGB stars. Finally, we discuss that microwave emission from
spinning dust in AGB envelopes could be observed with high-resolution upcoming
radio telescopes such as ngVLA and ALMA Band 1. This would be a major leap for
understanding AGB envelopes, formation, evolution, and internal structures of
dust. Observations would help to distinguish the carrier of AME from comparing
C-rich to O-rich stars, because PAHs are formed in C-rich AGB stars while
silicates are formed in O-rich stars.

pixel-wise knowledge of the depths and semantic labels for each image from a

independently using two separate CNNs. In this paper, we propose a model that
is able to predict both outputs simultaneously, which leads to improved results
and even reduced computational costs compared to independent estimation of
depth and semantics. We also empirically prove that the CNN is capable of
learning more meaningful and semantically richer features. Furthermore, our
SDNet estimates the depth based on ordinal classification. On the basis of
these two enhancements, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results
in semantic segmentation and depth estimation from single monocular input

the ACS is predominantly populated of old stars ($\sim 10\,\rm{Gyr}$), whereas
Monoceros has a pronounced tail of younger stars ($6-10\, \rm{Gyr}$) as
revealed by their cumulative age distributions. Put togehter, all of this
evidence support predictions from simulations of the interaction of the
Sagittarius dwarf with the Milky Way, which argue that the Anticenter Stream

the presence of attack, only a subset of all measurements are made available to
the state-estimator. We seek to find an state-estimator that results in the
minimum estimation error for the worst-case attack strategy. First, we
parameterize the set of all state-estimators that result in stable estimation
error for the worst-case attack scenario. Then, we will show that any
state-estimator in this set can be written as a generalized Luenberger observer
with an appropriately defined observer-gain. This observer-gain, in general,
can be an operator and possibly unbounded as opposed to the classical static
observer-gain. Furthermore, we will show that finding the optimal
state-estimator that results in the minimum estimation error can be cast as a
convex program over the set of stable factors of the observer operator-gain.

$2.65<\eta<3.9$ along with the forward-going proton $p$, which scatters with a
near-beam forward pseudorapidity into Roman Pot detectors. The sum of the
$\pi^0$ and the scattered proton energies is consistent with the incident
proton energy of 100 GeV, indicating that no further particles are produced in
this direction. It is postulated that the forward incident proton may have
fluctuated into a $p+\pi^0$ system, with an angular momentum correlated with
the initial proton spin. The backward-going proton interacts with the $p+\pi^0$
system, which then separates such that the $\pi^0$ has a transverse momentum of
${\sim}2$ GeV/$c$ and the proton has a transverse momentum of ${\sim}0.2$
GeV/$c$, while the backward proton shatters into the remaining particles $X$.
Correlations between the $\pi^0$ and scattered proton will be presented, along
with single-spin asymmetries which depend on the azimuthal angles of both the
pion and the proton. This is the first time that spin asymmetries have been
explored for this process, and a model to explain their azimuthal dependence is

regressing the vertex coordinates of a mesh model from a single depth map. To

the first stage, the network estimates a dense correspondence field for every

design a differentiable operator to map features learned from the previous

the mesh grid to recover the mesh vertices, and fit it an articulated template
mesh in closed form. During inference, the network can predict all the mesh
vertices, transformation matrices for every joint and the joint coordinates in
a single forward pass. When given supervision on the sparse key-point

variable for novel spintronic devices. Recent studies have shown that the
field-like and antidamping spin-orbit torques (SOT) can be used to switch the
N\'eel vector in antiferromagnets with proper symmetries. However, the precise
detection of the N\'eel vector remains a challenging problem. In this letter,
we predict that the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (AHE) can be used to detect
the N\'eel vector in most compensated antiferromagnets supporting the
antidamping SOT. We show that the magnetic crystal group symmetry of these
antiferromagnets combined with spin-orbit coupling produce a sizable Berry
curvature dipole and hence the nonlinear AHE. As a specific example, we
consider half-Heusler alloy CuMnSb, which N\'eel vector can be switched by the
antidamping SOT. Based on density functional theory calculations, we show that
the nonlinear AHE in CuMnSb results in a measurable Hall voltage under
conventional experimental conditions. The strong dependence of the Berry
curvature dipole on the N\'eel vector orientation provides a new detection
scheme of the N\'eel vector based on the nonlinear AHE. Our predictions enrich
the material platform for studying non-trivial phenomena associated with the
Berry curvature and broaden the range of materials useful for AFM spintronics.

  To obtain both flexibility and ease of use, a number of systems have explored
a workflow that we call output-directed programming. In this paradigm, direct
manipulation of the program's graphical output corresponds to writing code in a
general-purpose programming language, and edits not possible with the mouse can
still be enacted through ordinary text edits to the program. Such capabilities
provide hope for integrating graphical user interfaces into what are currently
text-centric programming environments.
  To further advance this vision, we present a variety of new output-directed
techniques that extend the expressive power of Sketch-n-Sketch, an
output-directed programming system for creating programs that generate vector
graphics. To enable output-directed interaction at more stages of program
construction, we expose intermediate execution products for manipulation and we
present a mechanism for contextual drawing. Looking forward to output-directed
programming beyond vector graphics, we also offer generic refactorings through
the GUI, and our techniques employ a domain-agnostic provenance tracing scheme.
  To demonstrate the improved expressiveness, we implement a dozen new
parametric designs in Sketch-n-Sketch without text-based edits. Among these is
the first demonstration of building a recursive function in an output-directed

scaling dimensions and conformal spins are extracted from the energies and

local operators and string operators on the lattice are identified with CFT
operators with PBC and APBC, respectively. Finally, operator product expansion
coefficients are extracted by computing matrix elements of lattice primary

variations. The deformation simulation utilizes virtual physical particles that
receive interaction forces from the surface and other particles and adjust
their positions accordingly. The proposed method involves two stages. In the
initialization stage, the three-dimensional internal structure of the surface
mesh is uniformly sampled using the particle expansion and attracting-repelling
force models whilst simultaneously building the internal particle connections.
In the simulation stage, under surface profile variations, we simulate the
internal structural deformation based on a deformation force model that uses
the internal particle connections. The main advantage of this method is that it
greatly reduces the computational burden as it only involves simplified
calculations and also does not require generating three-dimensional meshes.
Preliminary experimental results show that the proposed method can handle up to

  surfaces","Submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics. 37 pages and 29 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flow in a turbulent channel with a
random rough wall is performed at $Re_{\tau}=400$ and $600$. The roughness
geometry corresponds to the experiments of Flack and Schultz (personal
communication). The rough surface is used on the bottom wall of the channel.
DNS of a smooth channel flow and a rod-roughened channel flow are also
performed at $Re_{\tau}=400$ for validation and comparison. The skin friction
coefficient of the random-rough channel shows good agreement with the
experimental results of Flack and Schultz. Due to the roughness, the slip
velocity on the rough wall increases while the mean velocity decreases in the
log-law region. The streamwise and spanwise velocity fluctuations are enhanced
near the rough wall. The pressure fluctuations show a significant increase in
the roughness layer and exhibit a good collapse with the smooth wall in the
outer layer. The streamwise mean momentum balance shows that pressure and
viscous stress gradients are induced in the roughness layer, and the gradients
are amplified at higher $Re_{\tau}$. The statistics of wall-shear stress
fluctuations in the peak (above the mean height location) and valley (below the
mean height location) regions are examined. The results indicate that reverse
flow mainly occurs in the valley regions of the random roughness, and is
enhanced at higher $Re_{\tau}$, but is not as strong as the recirculation
within the cavities in the rod-roughened channel. The probability distribution
function of wall-shear stress shows a better collapse after subtracting the
mean and normalizing by the root-mean-squared value. The distribution tail is
widened by the random roughness, implying that the probability of extreme
events is increased. The probability of extreme events in the random-rough
channel increases with increasing $Re_{\tau}$, in accordance with previous
studies on smooth-wall flows.

  Validation Studies to Intervention Trials",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many lifestyle intervention trials depend on collecting self-reported
outcomes, like dietary intake, to assess the intervention's effectiveness.
Self-reported outcome measures are subject to measurement error, which could
impact treatment effect estimation. External validation studies measure both
self-reported outcomes and an accompanying biomarker, and can therefore be used
for measurement error correction. Most validation data, though, are only
relevant for outcomes under control conditions. Statistical methods have been
developed to use external validation data to correct for outcome measurement
error under control, and then conduct sensitivity analyses around the error
under treatment to obtain estimates of the corrected average treatment effect.
However, an assumption underlying this approach is that the measurement error
structure of the outcome is the same in both the validation sample and the
intervention trial, so that the error correction is transportable to the trial.
This may not always be a valid assumption to make. In this paper, we propose an
approach that adjusts the validation sample to better resemble the trial sample
and thus leads to more transportable measurement error corrections. We also
formally investigate when bias due to poor transportability may arise. Lastly,
we examine the method performance using simulation, and illustrate them using
PREMIER, a multi-arm lifestyle intervention trial measuring self-reported
sodium intake as an outcome, and OPEN, a validation study that measures both
self-reported diet and urinary biomarkers.

capsize of ships, resonance transitions in celestial mechanics, and dynamic
snap-through of arches and shells, as well as molecular reconfigurations in
chemical reactions. The criteria and routes of escape in one-degree of freedom
systems has been well studied theoretically with reasonable agreement with
experiment. The trajectory can only transit from the hilltop of the
one-dimensional potential energy surface. The situation becomes more
complicated when the system has higher degrees of freedom since it has multiple
routes to escape through an equilibrium of saddle-type, specifically, an
index-1 saddle. This paper summarizes the geometry of escape across a saddle in
some widely known physical systems with two degrees of freedom and establishes
the criteria of escape providing both a methodology and results under the
conceptual framework known as tube dynamics. These problems are classified into
two categories based on whether the saddle projection and focus projection in
the symplectic eigenspace are coupled or not when damping and/or gyroscopic
effects are considered. To simplify the process, only the linearized system
around the saddle points are analyzed. We define a transition region,
$\mathcal{T}_h$, as the region of initial conditions of a given initial energy
$h$ which transit from one side of a saddle to the other. We find that in
conservative systems, the boundary of the transition region, $\partial
\mathcal{T}_h$, is a cylinder, while in dissipative systems, $\partial
\mathcal{T}_h$ is an ellipsoid.

$E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the associated nucleon specific energy $E_0(\rho)$ in
symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) within a Bayesian statistical approach using an
explicitly isospin-dependent parametric Equation of State (EOS) for nucleonic
matter. We found that: (1) The available astrophysical data can already improve
significantly our current knowledge about the EOS in the density range of
$\rho_0-2.5\rho_0$. In particular, the symmetry energy at twice the saturation
density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter is determined to be
$E_{\mathrm{sym}}(2\rho_0)$ =39.2$_{-8.2}^{+12.1}$ MeV at 68\% confidence

statistical error but no systematic error will not improve much the constraints
on the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter compared to what we extracted
from using the available radius data. (3) The $R_{1.4}$ radius data and other
general conditions, such as the observed NS maximum mass and causality
condition introduce strong correlations for the high-order EOS parameters.
Consequently, the high-density behavior of $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ inferred
depends strongly on how the high-density SNM EOS $E_0(\rho)$ is parameterized,
and vice versa. (4) The value of the observed maximum NS mass and whether it is
used as a sharp cut-off for the minimum maximum mass or through a Gaussian
distribution affect significantly the lower boundaries of both the $E_0(\rho)$
and $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ only at densities higher than about $2.5\rho_0$.

the underlying network graph is structurally robust. For instance, to achieve
distributed consensus in the presence of adversaries, the underlying network
graph needs to satisfy certain robustness conditions. A typical approach to
making networks structurally robust is to strategically add extra links between
nodes, which might be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an
alternative way of improving network's robustness, that is by considering
heterogeneity of nodes. Nodes in a network can be of different types and can
have multiple variants. As a result, different nodes can have disjoint sets of
vulnerabilities, which means that an attacker can only compromise a particular
type of nodes by exploiting a particular vulnerability. We show that, by such a
diversification of nodes, attacker's ability to change the underlying network
structure is significantly reduced. Consequently, even a sparse network with
heterogeneous nodes can exhibit the properties of a structurally robust
network. Using these ideas, we propose a distributed control policy that
utilizes heterogeneity in the network to achieve resilient consensus in
adversarial environment. We extend the notion of $(r,s)$-robustness to
incorporate the diversity of nodes and provide necessary and sufficient
conditions to guarantee resilient distributed consensus in heterogeneous
networks. Finally we study the properties and construction of robust graphs
with heterogeneous nodes.

for the interior and exterior spacetimes, working in $f({\mathcal R})$ gravity,
and extending the calculations to higher dimensions. We find that the effective
spacetime geometry is again a gravastar, but now with a metric which strongly
depends on the modified gravity function $f({\mathcal R})$. This implies that
the interior of the gravastar can be de Sitter or anti-de Sitter and the
exterior can be Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-de Sitter, or
Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter, with a condition that the cosmological constant
for the exterior must be smaller than the one for the interior. These
geometries are determined by the function $f({\mathcal R})$, in contrast to
previous works where they were selected by hand. We also presented a new
possible value for the size of the gravastar provided a certain inequality is

a widely employed practical approach involves sampling from a simpler

propose the Random Fourier Softmax (RF-softmax) method that utilizes the
powerful Random Fourier Features to enable more efficient and accurate sampling

logarithmically with the number of classes.

microscopy experiments allow for the counting of organelles at the single-cell
level. These measurements provide information about the cell-to-cell
variability in organelle abundance in addition to the mean level. Motivated by
such measurements, we build upon a recent study and analyze a general
stochastic model of organelle biogenesis. We compute the exact analytical
expressions for the probability distribution of organelle numbers, their mean,
and variance across a population of single cells. It is shown that different
mechanisms of organelle biogenesis lead to distinct signatures in the
distribution of organelle numbers which allows us to discriminate between these
various mechanisms. By comparing our theory against published data for
peroxisome abundance measurements in yeast, we show that a widely believed
model of peroxisome biogenesis that involves de novo synthesis, fission, and

bimodality in certain limits of the model. Overall, the framework developed

changed detects the light signal. This optical setup enables the detection of
light signals with low noise and remarkably high precision and sensitivity

types to open curves by identifying their projections as virtual knots. In this

Modelling confined polymers using both lattice walks and ideal chains, we find

any single knot type, a behaviour we call weakly knotted. We compare cubically
confined lattice walks and spherically confined ideal chains, finding the weak
knotting probability in both families is quite similar and growing with length,

the probability of weak knotting in unconfined walks is small at all lengths
investigated. For spherically confined ideal chains, weak knotting is strongly
correlated with the degree of confinement but is almost entirely independent of
length. For ideal chains confined to tubes and slits, weak knotting is
correlated with an adjusted degree of confinement, again with length having

witness quantum information scrambling in many-body system dynamics. These
correlators can be understood as averages over nonclassical multi-time
quasi-probability distributions (QPDs). These QPDs have more information, and
their nonclassical features witness quantum information scrambling in a more
nuanced way. However, their high dimensionality and nonclassicality make QPDs
challenging to measure experimentally. We focus on the topical case of a
many-qubit system and show how to obtain such a QPD in the laboratory using
circuits with three and four sequential measurements. Averaging distinct values
over the same measured distribution reveals either the OTOC or parameters of
its QPD. Stronger measurements minimize experimental resources despite

Systems (IDSs) are developed to secure the CAN protocol by detecting abnormal

exploits voltage characteristics of each ECU to detect an intrusion. An ECU
with VIDS must be connected to the CAN bus using extra wires to measure

attack surfaces to the CAN bus if the ECU with VIDS is compromised. We
investigate new vulnerabilities of VIDS and demonstrate that an adversary may

high-fidelity image synthesis, there lacks enough understanding of how GANs are
able to map a latent code sampled from a random distribution to a
photo-realistic image. Previous work assumes the latent space learned by GANs
follows a distributed representation but observes the vector arithmetic
phenomenon. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called InterFaceGAN,
for semantic face editing by interpreting the latent semantics learned by GANs.
In this framework, we conduct a detailed study on how different semantics are
encoded in the latent space of GANs for face synthesis. We find that the latent
code of well-trained generative models actually learns a disentangled
representation after linear transformations. We explore the disentanglement
between various semantics and manage to decouple some entangled semantics with
subspace projection, leading to more precise control of facial attributes.
Besides manipulating gender, age, expression, and the presence of eyeglasses,
we can even vary the face pose as well as fix the artifacts accidentally
generated by GAN models. The proposed method is further applied to achieve real
image manipulation when combined with GAN inversion methods or some
encoder-involved models. Extensive results suggest that learning to synthesize
faces spontaneously brings a disentangled and controllable facial attribute
representation.

free electrons in the interstellar medium. Although the phenomenon has a
distinct similarity to gravitational lensing, particularly in its mathematical
description, plasma lensing introduces other additional features, such as
wavelength dependence, radial rather than tangential image distortions, and
strong demagnification of background sources. Axisymmetrical models of plasma
lenses have been well-studied in the literature, but density distributions with
more complicated shapes can provide new and exotic image configurations and
increase the richness of the magnification properties. As a first step towards
non-axisymmetrical distributions, we study two families of elliptical plasma
lens, softened power-law and exponential plasma distributions. We perform
numerical studies on each lens model, and present them over a parameter space.
In addition to deriving elliptical plasma lens formulae, we also investigate
the number of critical curves that the lens can produce by studying the lens
parameter space, in particular the dependence on the lensing ellipticity. We
find that the introduction of ellipticity into the plasma distribution can
enhance the lensing effects as well as the complexity of the magnification map.

Cross-diffusion waves nucleate when the overall stress field is incompatible

forces with generalized thermodynamic fluxes of another kind. Cross-diffusion
terms in the 4 x 4 THMC diffusion matrix are shown to lead to multiple
diffusional $P$- and $S$-wave solutions of the coupled THMC equations.
Uncertainties in the location of local material instabilities are captured by
wave scale correlation of probability amplitudes. Cross-diffusional waves have
unusual dispersion patterns and, although they assume a solitary state, do not
behave like solitons but have a quasi-elastic particle-like state. Their
characteristic wavenumber and constant speed defines mesoscopic internal
material time-space relations entirely defined by the coefficients of the
coupled THMC reaction-cross-diffusion equations. These coefficients are
identified here as material parameters underpinning the criterion for
nucleation and speed of diffusional waves. Interpreting patterns in nature as

mathematical framework for analysis of multi-physics instabilities and

intractable. A much simpler alternative to Gittins is the shortest expected

population-level partial differential equations in the continuum limit. We show
that this model of a persistent exclusion process is in general well described

of the canonical diffusion or heat equation being recovered in either the case
of persistence without spatial exclusion, or spatial exclusion without
persistence. We generalise our results to include systems of multiple species

drift in addition to persistence. These models are shown to be governed
approximately by systems of nonlinear advection-diffusion equations. By

Energetic Sun (SPIES), which is a novel integral field unit spectrograph at the
Dunn Solar Telescope. We determine the shock properties (the Mach number and
the propagation speed) by fitting the measured He I spectral profiles with a
theoretical radiative transfer model consisting of two constant property
atmospheric slabs whose temperatures and macroscopic velocities are constrained
by the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. From the Mach number, the shock heating
energy per unit mass of plasma is derived to be 2 x 10^{10} erg g^{-1}, which
is insufficient to maintain the umbral chromosphere. In addition, we find that
the shocks propagate upward with the sound speed and the Mach number does not
depend on the temperature upstream of the shocks. The latter may imply
suppression of the amplification of the Mach number due to energy loss of the
shocks.

human-skin fibroblast NB1RGB cells as the model system. The presence of the
collagen coating is expected to enhance the adherence of the fibroblasts to the
dish surface, and thereby also enhance the traction that the fibroblasts have
as they move. We find that, contrary to our initial expectation, the coating
does not significantly affect the motility of the fibroblasts. Their eventual
number density at confluence is also unaffected. However, the coherence length
of cell orientation in the swirling pattern is diminished. We also find that
the fibroblasts cultured in a collagen-coated dish are rounder in shape and
shorter in perimeter, compared to those cultured in an uncoated dish. We
hypothesize that the rounder cell-shape which weakens the cell-cell nematic
contact interaction is responsible for the change in coherence length. A simple
mathematical model of the migrating fibroblasts is constructed, which
demonstrates that constant motility with weaker nematic interaction strength
does indeed lead to the shortening of the coherence length.

image characterizes the harmony of its visual elements according to the
principles of art, and provides richer information for learning aesthetics. In
this work, we propose to model the image composition information as the mutual
dependency of its local regions, and design a novel architecture to leverage
such information to boost the performance of aesthetics assessment. To achieve
this, we densely partition an image into local regions and compute
aesthetics-preserving features over the regions to characterize the aesthetics
properties of image content. With the feature representation of local regions,
we build a region composition graph in which each node denotes one region and
any two nodes are connected by an edge weighted by the similarity of the region
features. We perform reasoning on this graph via graph convolution, in which
the activation of each node is determined by its highly correlated neighbors.
Our method naturally uncovers the mutual dependency of local regions in the
network training procedure, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on

turns out that the existing LPPMs cannot adequately protect spatiotemporal

  Performance Tracking","This work is accepted by CVPR 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Improvements in data-capture and face modeling techniques have enabled us to
create high-fidelity realistic face models. However, driving these realistic
face models requires special input data, e.g. 3D meshes and unwrapped textures.
Also, these face models expect clean input data taken under controlled lab
environments, which is very different from data collected in the wild. All
these constraints make it challenging to use the high-fidelity models in
tracking for commodity cameras. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised
domain adaptation approach to enable the animation of high-fidelity face models
from a commodity camera. Our approach first circumvents the requirement for
special input data by training a new network that can directly drive a face
model just from a single 2D image. Then, we overcome the domain mismatch
between lab and uncontrolled environments by performing self-supervised domain
adaptation based on ""consecutive frame texture consistency"" based on the
assumption that the appearance of the face is consistent over consecutive
frames, avoiding the necessity of modeling the new environment such as lighting
or background. Experiments show that we are able to drive a high-fidelity face
model to perform complex facial motion from a cellphone camera without
requiring any labeled data from the new domain.

and topological interactions governing semidilute polymer dynamics in strong
flows are challenging to characterize. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations are
particularly valuable as a way to direct visualize how molecular interactions
arise in these systems; however, BD simulations are often computationally
limited by the need to calculate the correlated Brownian noise via
decomposition of the diffusion tensor. Previously we have introduced an
iterative conformational averaging (CA) method for BD simulations which
bypasses these limitations by preaveraging the HI and Brownian noise in an
iterative procedure. In this work, we generalize the CA method to flowing
semidilute solutions by introducing a conformation dependent diffusion tensor
and a strain dependent approximation to the conformationally averaged Brownian
noise. We find that this approach nearly quantitatively reproduces both
transient and steady state polymer dynamics and rheology while achieving an
order of magnitude computational acceleration. We then utilize the CA method to
investigate the concentration and flow rate dependence of polymer dynamics in
planar extensional flows. Our results are consistent with previous experimental
and simulation studies and provide a detailed view of broad conformational
distributions in the semidilute regime. We observe interconversion between
stretched and coiled states at steady state, which we conjecture occur due to
the effect of concentration on the conformation dependent polymer drag.
Additionally, we observe transient flow-induced intermolecular hooks in the
startup of flow which lead to diverse and unique stretching pathways.

analogues of classical techniques. The problem of bootstrapping network data
stands out as especially challenging, since typically one observes only a

bootstrap samples for networks drawn from latent space models. The first method
generates bootstrap replicates of network statistics that can be represented as
U-statistics in the latent positions, and avoids actually constructing new
bootstrapped networks. The second method generates bootstrap replicates of
whole networks, and thus can be used for bootstrapping any network function.
Commonly studied network quantities that can be represented as U-statistics
include many popular summaries, such as average degree and subgraph counts, but
other equally popular summaries, such as the clustering coefficient, are not
expressible as U-statistics and thus require the second bootstrap method. Under
the assumption of a random dot product graph, a type of latent space network
model, we show consistency of the proposed bootstrap methods. We give
motivating examples throughout and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods

with great success for the analysis of functional data, such as functional
principal component analysis, cannot be applied. In this paper we propose
metric covariance, a novel association measure for paired object data lying in
a metric space $(\Omega,d)$ that we use to define a metric auto-covariance
function for a sample of random $\Omega$-valued curves, where $\Omega$
generally will not have a vector space or manifold structure. The proposed
metric auto-covariance function is non-negative definite when the squared
semimetric $d^2$ is of negative type. Then the eigenfunctions of the linear
operator with the auto-covariance function as kernel can be used as building
blocks for an object functional principal component analysis for
$\Omega$-valued functional data, including time-varying probability
distributions, covariance matrices and time-dynamic networks. Analogues of
functional principal components for time-varying objects are obtained by
applying Fr\'echet means and projections of distance functions of the random
object trajectories in the directions of the eigenfunctions, leading to
real-valued Fr\'echet scores. Using the notion of generalized Fr\'echet

use an accurate, but not optimal, primal-dual feasible pair, making our methods

feasible output trajectory can be tracked by the inputs. Unlike existing
model-free or data-driven control approaches, this framework guarantees
nonlinear stability. The controller and observer designs in the proposed
framework are nonlinearly stable and robust to the unknown dynamics as well as
unknown measurement noise. For ease of computer implementation, the framework
is developed in discrete time. Nonlinear stability analyses of the
discrete-time observers and controllers are carried out using discrete Lyapunov
analysis. The unknown input-output dynamics is learnt in real time using a
nonlinearly stable observer from prior input-output history. This observer
ensures finite-time stable convergence of model estimation errors to zero if
the unknown model is constant, and model estimation errors converge to a
bounded neighborhood of the zero vector if the model has bounded change in
discrete time. Measured outputs are filtered by a finite-time stable observer
before use in feedback tracking of a desired output trajectory. Finite-time
stable observer design in this framework also ensures that a nonlinear
separation principle is in effect for separate controller and observer design.
A model-free nonlinearly stable control scheme is then designed to ensure
convergence of observed outputs to a desired output trajectory. This control
scheme ensures nonlinear finite-time stable convergence of tracking errors to a
manifold where the tracking errors decay asymptotically. A numerical experiment
on a nonlinear second-order system demonstrates the performance of this
nonlinear model-free control framework.

been the leading approach to address this problem. However, in spite of a large

proposed a hybrid method, called wavegraph that mixes the two approaches. It
uses astrophysical information at the extraction stage of model-independent

proved by means of a Lyapunov-based analysis simultaneously showing consensus
of the dual estimates to a dual optimal solution, convergence of the tracking

communication technique capable of creating a controllable propagation
environment. In this paper, we propose to invoke an IRS at the cell boundary of
multiple cells to assist the downlink transmission to cell-edge users, whilst
mitigating the inter-cell interference, which is a crucial issue in multicell
communication systems. We aim for maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all
users through jointly optimizing the active precoding matrices at the base
stations (BSs) and the phase shifts at the IRS subject to each BS's power
constraint and unit modulus constraint. Both the BSs and the users are equipped
with multiple antennas, which enhances the spectral efficiency by exploiting
the spatial multiplexing gain. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we
first reformulate it into an equivalent one, which is solved by using the block
coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, where the precoding matrices and phase
shifts are alternately optimized. The optimal precoding matrices can be
obtained in closed form, when fixing the phase shifts. A pair of efficient
algorithms are proposed for solving the phase shift optimization problem,
namely the Majorization-Minimization (MM) Algorithm and the Complex Circle
Manifold (CCM) Method. Both algorithms are guaranteed to converge to at least
locally optimal solutions. We also extend the proposed algorithms to the more
general multiple-IRS and network MIMO scenarios. Finally, our simulation
results confirm the advantages of introducing IRSs in enhancing the cell-edge

while retaining the attractive flexibility of fully conditional specification
multiple imputation by specifying the joint distribution of analysis and

type of variable. JointAI provides functions for Bayesian inference with
generalized linear and generalized linear mixed models and extensions thereof

($H_\mu(\overline{X}) \ll \sum_i H_\mu(X_i)$), using as little (expected)
memory as possible, such that each individual file $X_i$ can be recovered
quickly with few (ideally constant) memory accesses.
  In the case of independent random files, a dramatic result by \Pat (FOCS'08)
and subsequently by Dodis, \Pat and Thorup (STOC'10) shows that it is possible
to store $\overline{X}$ using just a \emph{constant} number of extra bits
beyond the information-theoretic minimum space, while at the same time decoding
each $X_i$ in constant time. However, in the (realistic) case where the files
are correlated, much weaker results are known, requiring at least
$\Omega(n/poly\lg n)$ extra bits for constant decoding time, even for ""simple""
joint distributions $\mu$.
  We focus on the natural case of compressing\emph{Markov chains}, i.e.,
storing a length-$n$ random walk on any (possibly directed) graph $G$. Denoting
by $\kappa(G,n)$ the number of length-$n$ walks on $G$, we show that there is a

$O(\lg n)$ decoding time, and show that any improvement on this would lead to
an improved solution on the long-standing Dictionary problem. All of our data

that its energy-momentum tensor is of the isotropic perfect fluid with the
pressure being precisely the opposite to its energy density. It can thus
provide a model for dark energy. We study its application in both black hole
physics and cosmology. The quasi-topological term has no effect on the purely

however completely modified. We find that the dyonic black holes can have four
real horizons. For suitable parameters, the black hole can admit as many as
three photon spheres, with one being stable. Another intriguing property is
that although the quasi-topological term breaks the electromagnetic duality,
the symmetry emerges in the on-shell action in the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. In
cosmology, we demonstrate that the quasi-topological term alone is equivalent
to a cosmological constant, but the model provides a mechanism for the dark
energy to couple with other types of matter. We present a concrete example of

compact polarized sources across our dataset with polarization fractions
ranging from less than 0.5% to nearly 100%. These sources exhibit a positive
correlation between polarization fraction and total intensity, and we interpret
them as a continuum of plasma emission noise storm (Type I burst) continua

central polarized component is surrounded by a ring of the opposite sense. The
central component does not match the sign expected from thermal bremsstrahlung
emission, and we speculate that propagation effects or an alternative emission
mechanism may be responsible. Third, we show that the large-scale polarimetric
structure at our lowest frequencies is reasonably well-correlated with the

super-high mobility electrons in suspended samples without chemical doping. As
far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the
Coulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering
potentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by
the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter
of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The
empty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical
shortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the
circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage of
the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We
consider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit
formulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae
for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution of this
scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function
of the Fermi energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results
are consistent with experiment, where the resistance was measured as a function
of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene. This fact gives a
possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the base of the
available experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with
the gate voltage controlled Fermi level position. It is clear to be very
important for applications.

continuous term with adaptive varying gains is added to alleviate the effects
of the external disturbances with unknown bounds. In the case of a fixed
directed graph, by introducing an integrate term in the auxiliary variable
design, the final consensus equilibrium can be explicitly derived. We show that
the agents achieve weighted average consensus, where the final equilibrium is
dependent on three factors, namely, the interactive topology, the initial
positions of the agents, and the control gains of the proposed control
algorithm. In the case of switching directed graphs, a model reference adaptive
consensus based algorithm is proposed such that the agents achieve leaderless
consensus if the infinite sequence of switching graphs is uniformly jointly

difficult to obtain accurately, we further propose a leaderless consensus
algorithm with gain adaptation for multiple Lagrangian systems without using

Herein, the vibrational and mechanical properties of polymeric glasses are
examined by using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, with
particular attention to the effects of the bending rigidity of the polymer
chains. As the rigidity increases, the system undergoes a glass transition at a
higher temperature (under a constant pressure), which decreases the density of
the glass phase. The elastic moduli, which are controlled by the decrease of
the density and the increase of the rigidity, show a non-monotonic dependence
on the rigidity of the polymer chain that arises from the non-affine component.
Moreover, a clear boson peak is observed in the vibrational density of states,
which depends on the macroscopic shear modulus $G$. In particular, the boson
peak frequency is scaled as $\omega_\mathrm{BP} \propto \sqrt{G}$. These
results provide a positive correlation between the boson peak, shear
elasticity, and the glass transition temperature.

learning lead to good performance is an important task. In this paper, using
the framework for analyzing the generalization error developed in Suzuki
(2018), we derive a fast learning rate for deep neural networks with more
general activation functions. In Suzuki (2018), assuming the scale invariance
of activation functions, the tight generalization error bound of deep learning
was derived. They mention that the scale invariance of the activation function
is essential to derive tight error bounds. Whereas the rectified linear unit
(ReLU; Nair and Hinton, 2010) satisfies the scale invariance, the other famous
activation functions including the sigmoid and the hyperbolic tangent
functions, and the exponential linear unit (ELU; Clevert et al., 2016) does not
satisfy this condition. The existing analysis indicates a possibility that a
deep learning with the non scale invariant activations may have a slower
convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ when one with the scale invariant
activations can reach a rate faster than $O(1/\sqrt{n})$. In this paper,
without the scale invariance of activation functions, we derive the tight
generalization error bound which is essentially the same as that of Suzuki
(2018). From this result, at least in the framework of Suzuki (2018), it is
shown that the scale invariance of the activation functions is not essential to
get the fast rate of convergence. Simultaneously, it is also shown that the
theoretical framework proposed by Suzuki (2018) can be widely applied for
analysis of deep learning with general activation functions.

a proof of concept showing that it is possible to obfuscate the inner workings
of a CNN. Finally, we combine input and model manipulation. To this end we put
a backdoor in the network: the explanation is correct unless there is a
specific pattern present in the input, which triggers a malicious explanation.
Our work raises new security concerns, especially in settings where
explanations of models may be used to make decisions, such as in the medical
domain.

  Classification","13 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.NI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  \emph{Over-fitting} and \emph{over-smoothing} are two main obstacles of
developing deep Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for node classification. In
particular, over-fitting weakens the generalization ability on small dataset,
while over-smoothing impedes model training by isolating output representations
from the input features with the increase in network depth. This paper proposes
DropEdge, a novel and flexible technique to alleviate both issues. At its core,
DropEdge randomly removes a certain number of edges from the input graph at
each training epoch, acting like a data augmenter and also a message passing
reducer. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that DropEdge either reduces
the convergence speed of over-smoothing or relieves the information loss caused
by it. More importantly, our DropEdge is a general skill that can be equipped
with many other backbone models (e.g. GCN, ResGCN, GraphSAGE, and JKNet) for
enhanced performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify that
DropEdge consistently improves the performance on a variety of both shallow and
deep GCNs. The effect of DropEdge on preventing over-smoothing is empirically
visualized and validated as well. Codes are released

saturation of the flow driven by parametric resonance of inertial waves in a
rotating fluid. In our set-up, a half-meter wide ellipsoid filled with water is
brought to solid body rotation, and then undergoes sustained harmonic
modulation of its rotation rate. This triggers the exponential growth of a pair
of inertial waves via a mechanism called the libration-driven elliptical
instability. Once the saturation of this instability is reached, we observe a
turbulent state for which energy is injected into the resonant inertial waves
only. Depending on the amplitude of the rotation rate modulation, two different
saturation states are observed. At large forcing amplitudes, the saturation
flow mainly consists of a steady, geostrophic anticyclone. Its amplitude
vanishes as the forcing amplitude is decreased while remaining above the
threshold of the elliptical instability. Below this secondary transition, the
saturation flow is a superposition of inertial waves which are in weakly
non-linear resonant interaction, a state that could asymptotically lead to
inertial wave turbulence. In addition to being a first experimental observation
of a wave-dominated saturation in unstable rotating flows, the present study is
also an experimental confirmation of the model of Le Reun et al, PRL (2017) who
introduced the possibility of these two turbulent regimes. The transition
between these two regimes and their relevance to geophysical applications are
finally discussed.

principles calculations for the model produce a ferromagnetic ground state with
a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton per H atom and an estimated Curie
temperature above 250~K. The removal of the $p_z$-orbitals from sublattice B of
graphene introduces $p_z$-vacancies. The $p_z$-vacancy-induced states are not
created from changes in interatomic interactions but are created because of a
$p_z$-orbital imbalance between two sublattices (A and B) of a conjugated
$p_z$-orbital network. Therefore, there are critical requirements for the
creation of these states (denoted as $p_z^{\rm imbalance}$) to avoid further
imbalances and minimize the effects on the conjugated $p_z$-orbital network.
The requirements on the creation of $p_z^{\rm imbalance}$ are as follows: 1)
$p_z^{\rm imbalance}$ consists of $p_z$-orbitals of only the atoms in
sublattice A, 2) the spatial wavefunction of $p_z^{\rm imbalance}$ is
antisymmetric, and 3) in principle, $p_z^{\rm imbalance}$ extends over the
entire crystal without decaying, unless other $p_z$-vacancies are crossed. Both
the origin of spin polarization and the magnetic ordering of the model arise
from the aforementioned requirements.

Overall, there is a need for an intelligent and lightweight system which can
automatically monitor eating behaviour and provide feedback. In this paper, we
investigate: i) the development of an automated system for detecting eating
behaviour using wearable Electromyography (EMG) sensors, and ii) the
application of such a system in combination with real time wristband haptic
feedback to facilitate mindful eating. Data collected from 16 participants were
used to develop an algorithm for detecting chewing and swallowing. We extracted
18 features from EMG and presented those features to different classifiers. We
demonstrated that eating behaviour can be automatically assessed accurately
using the EMG-extracted features and a Support Vector Machine (SVM):
F1-Score=0.94 for chewing classification, and F1-Score=0.86 for swallowing
classification. Based on this algorithm, we developed a system to enable
participants to self-moderate their chewing behaviour using haptic feedback. An
experiment study was carried out with 20 additional participants showing that
participants exhibited a lower rate of chewing when haptic feedback delivered
in forms of wristband vibration was used compared to a baseline and non-haptic
condition (F (2,38)=58.243, p<0.001). These findings may have major
implications for research in eating behaviour, providing key new insights into
the impacts of automatic chewing detection and haptic feedback systems on
moderating eating behaviour with the aim to improve health outcomes.

  Practice of Declarative Programming (PPDP 2019), Porto, Portugal",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Search strategies are crucial to efficiently solve constraint satisfaction
problems. However, programming search strategies in the existing constraint
solvers is a daunting task and constraint-based languages usually have
compositionality issues. We propose spacetime programming, a paradigm extending
the synchronous language Esterel and timed concurrent constraint programming
with backtracking, for creating and composing search strategies. In this
formalism, the search strategies are composed in the same way as we compose
concurrent processes. Our contributions include the design and behavioral
semantics of spacetime programming, and the proofs that spacetime programs are
deterministic, reactive and extensive functions. Moreover, spacetime
programming provides a bridge between the theoretical foundations of
constraint-based concurrency and the practical aspects of constraint solving.
We developed a prototype of the compiler that produces search strategies with a
small overhead compared to the hard-coded ones.

epistemic negation and have received renewed interest in recent years. This led
to the development of new research and efficient solving systems for ELPs. In
practice, ELPs are often written in a modular way, where each module interacts
with other modules by accepting sets of facts as input, and passing on sets of
facts as output. An interesting question then presents itself: under which
conditions can such a module be replaced by another one without changing the
outcome, for any set of input facts? This problem is known as uniform
equivalence, and has been studied extensively for ASP. For ELPs, however, such
an investigation is, as of yet, missing. In this paper, we therefore propose a
characterization of uniform equivalence that can be directly applied to the
language of state-of-the-art ELP solvers. We also investigate the computational
complexity of deciding uniform equivalence for two ELPs, and show that it is on
the third level of the polynomial hierarchy.

chemical potential bias, it witnesses a critical chemical potential above which

whole image is scanned by a local moving window with defined size and the 2D
Fourier Transform is calculated for each window. Then, all the Local Fourier
Transforms are fed into Machine Learning processing. Firstly, a number of

Scree Plot performed on the data. Secondly, the data are decomposed blindly by
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) into interpretable spatial maps

image is analyzed and the features on the image are automatically discovered,
based on the local changes in Fourier Transform. The user selects only a size

resolution. This automatic approach was successfully applied to analysis of
various microscopic images with and without local periodicity i.e. atomically

utilizes augmentation along Graver basis elements (the improvement direction is
obtained by comparing objective function values) from these multiple initial

which GAMA slows down as the problem size increases is much lower than that of
Gurobi. We find that for several instances of practical relevance, GAMA not
only vastly outperforms in terms of time to find the optimal solution (by two
or three orders of magnitude), but also finds optimal solutions within minutes
when the commercial solver is not able to do so in 4 or 10 hours (depending on
the problem class) in several cases.

atlas-based segmentation or landmark localisation and shape analysis. When

registration has often remained superior to deep learning methods that have so
far mainly dealt with relatively small or low-complexity deformations. We
address this shortcoming by leveraging ideas from probabilistic dense
displacement optimisation that has excelled in many registration tasks with
large deformations. We propose to design a network with approximate
min-convolutions and mean field inference for differentiable displacement
regularisation within a discrete weakly-supervised registration setting. By
employing these meaningful and theoretically proven constraints, our learnable
registration algorithm contains very few trainable weights (primarily for
feature extraction) and is easier to train with few labelled scans. It is very
fast in training and inference and achieves state-of-the-art accuracies for the
challenging inter-patient registration of abdominal CT outperforming previous
deep learning approaches by 15% Dice overlap.

environments and entering human-centric settings. For these robots, object
perception and grasping are two challenging tasks due to the high demand for
accurate and real-time responses. Although many problems have already been
understood and solved successfully, many challenges still remain. Open-ended
learning is one of these challenges waiting for many improvements. Cognitive
science revealed that humans learn to recognize object categories and grasp
affordances ceaselessly over time. This ability allows adapting to new
environments by enhancing their knowledge from the accumulation of experiences
and the conceptualization of new object categories. Inspired by this, an
autonomous robot must have the ability to process visual information and
conduct learning and recognition tasks in an open-ended fashion. In this
context, ""open-ended"" implies that the set of object categories to be learned
is not known in advance, and the training instances are extracted from online
experiences of a robot, and become gradually available over time, rather than
being completely available at the beginning of the learning process.
  In my research, I mainly focus on interactive open-ended learning approaches
to recognize multiple objects and their grasp affordances concurrently. In
particular, I try to address the following research questions: (i) What is the
importance of open-ended learning for autonomous robots? (ii) How robots could
learn incrementally from their own experiences as well as from interaction with
humans? (iii) What are the limitations of Deep Learning approaches to be used
in an open-ended manner? (iv) How to evaluate open-ended learning approaches

cessations of shearing, accompanied by refraction-matched internal imaging, to
supplement the conventional flow-curve measurements. At sufficiently high
volume fractions, the settling of particles after the cessations exhibits a
continuous yet distinct transition over the change of shear rate. Such changes
back out the qualitative difference in the state of flowing prior to the
cessations: the quasi-static yielding of a tightly packed network, as opposed
to the rapid sliding of particles mediated by the interstitial fluid whose
dynamics depends on the driving rate. In addition, we determine the solid-fluid
transition using two independent methods: the extrapolation of stress residues
and the estimated yield stress from high values of $\phi$, and the settling of
particles upon shear cessations as $\phi$ goes across the transition. We also
verify the power law on values of characteristic stress with respect to the
distance from jamming $\phi - \phi_c$, with an exponent close to 2. These
results demonstrate a multitude of relaxation timescales behind the dynamics of
soft particles, and provoke questions on how we extend existing paradigms on

performs poorly in these circumstances in contrast to a multilayer perceptron

hierarchical structure of the data is destroyed and long range correlations are
introduced which standard CNNs are not able to capture. We show that their

open problems, including Linial's question about the deterministic complexity
of maximal independent set [FOCS'87; SICOMP'92]---which had been called the
most outstanding problem in the area.
  The main implication is a more general distributed derandomization theorem:
Put together with the results of Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Maus [STOC'17] and
Ghaffari, Harris, and Kuhn [FOCS'18], our network decomposition implies that
$$\mathsf{P}\textit{-}\mathsf{RLOCAL} = \mathsf{P}\textit{-}\mathsf{LOCAL}.$$

polylogarithmic-time, any polylogarithmic-time randomized algorithm can be
derandomized to a polylogarithmic-time deterministic algorithm. Informally, for
the standard first-order interpretation of efficiency as polylogarithmic-time,
distributed algorithms do not need randomness for efficiency.
  By known connections, our result leads also to substantially faster
randomized distributed algorithms for a number of well-studied problems

parameter posterior distribution for complex statistical models and stochastic
processes that possess a computationally intractable likelihood function.
Instead of evaluating the likelihood, BSL approximates the likelihood of a
judiciously chosen summary statistic of the data via model simulation and
density estimation. Compared to alternative methods such as approximate
Bayesian computation (ABC), BSL requires little tuning and requires less model
simulations than ABC when the chosen summary statistic is high-dimensional. The
original synthetic likelihood relies on a multivariate normal approximation of
the intractable likelihood, where the mean and covariance are estimated by
simulation. An extension of BSL considers replacing the sample covariance with
a penalised covariance estimator to reduce the number of required model
simulations. Further, a semi-parametric approach has been developed to relax
the normality assumption. In this paper, we present an R package called BSL
that amalgamates the aforementioned methods and more into a single, easy-to-use

$w_{DE}$, but also it can cluster through its sound speed $c^2_{sDE}$, subject
to certain conditions. As is well-known, for dynamical dark energy models, dark
energy perturbations get sourced into matter perturbations through metric
perturbations which is always accompanied by the term $(1+w_{DE})$. Hence, for
dynamical dark energy models with $w_{DE}$ close $-1$, their perturbations get
almost decoupled from metric leaving nearly null imprints on matter power
spectra. Furthermore, Quintessence models with its sound speed equal to speed
of light, washes out almost any inhomogeneities occurred within sub-Hubble
scales, hence making detectability of dark energy perturbations far more
difficult than already is. In this article we look for these imprints by going
beyond Quintessence considering an Early Dark Energy parametrization that not
only have a non-negligible energy density at early times, but also it can
achieve $w_{DE}$ far from $-1$, making dark energy perturbations detectable in
sub-horizon scales. With the help of current datasets, we are able to constrain
sound speed of dark energy to a low value ($c^2_{sDE} \sim 0.14$), along with a
much higher range allowed for early dark energy density, with strong
constraints on it ($\Omega_e \sim 0.02$). We discuss effects of different
datasets on this parametrization along with possible explanation for deviation
on certain parameter(s) comparing between $c^2_{sDE}=1$ case and the case where
it is kept open.

models with the two dominant approaches being Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). However, standard Autoencoders
(AEs) and closely related structures have remained popular because they are
easy to train and adapt to different tasks. An interesting question is if we
can achieve state-of-the-art performance with AEs while retaining their good
properties. We propose an answer to this question by introducing a new model
called Y-Autoencoder (Y-AE). The structure and training procedure of a Y-AE
enclose a representation into an implicit and an explicit part. The implicit
part is similar to the output of an autoencoder and the explicit part is
strongly correlated with labels in the training set. The two parts are
separated in the latent space by splitting the output of the encoder into two
paths (forming a Y shape) before decoding and re-encoding. We then impose a
number of losses, such as reconstruction loss, and a loss on dependence between
the implicit and explicit parts. Additionally, the projection in the explicit
manifold is monitored by a predictor, that is embedded in the encoder and
trained end-to-end with no adversarial losses. We provide significant
experimental results on various domains, such as separation of style and
content, image-to-image translation, and inverse graphics.

second-order Horn clauses, to define the structure of learnable programs and
thus the hypothesis space. Deciding which metarules to use for a given learning
task is a major open problem and is a trade-off between efficiency and
expressivity: the hypothesis space grows given more metarules, so we wish to
use fewer metarules, but if we use too few metarules then we lose expressivity.
In this paper, we study whether fragments of metarules can be logically reduced
to minimal finite subsets. We consider two traditional forms of logical
reduction: subsumption and entailment. We also consider a new reduction
technique called \emph{derivation reduction}, which is based on SLD-resolution.
We compute reduced sets of metarules for fragments relevant to ILP and
theoretically show whether these reduced sets are reductions for more general
infinite fragments. We experimentally compare learning with reduced sets of
metarules on three domains: Michalski trains, string transformations, and game
rules. In general, derivation reduced sets of metarules outperforms subsumption
and entailment reduced sets, both in terms of predictive accuracies and
learning times.

that learning higher-order programs, rather than first-order programs, can
reduce the textual complexity required to express programs which in turn

above the 2.2 Mm heights. We identified for the 1st time waves with a short

20 to 30 km s-1 with the definite signature of Alfven waves. No correlation

evidenced, although their contrast is greatly attenuated by the overlapping

the generalized balance equation is obtained. The new source term in the energy

this regard, the perturbation parameters such as the amplitude of scalar

argue that, in the presence of gas, the dark halo plays a negligible role in

of the cold gas warp. Adding the stellar mass fraction improves the

treatment effect in clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints. It is
frequently assumed as constant over time although this assumption often does
not hold. When the hazard ratio deviates considerably from being constant, the
average of its plausible values is not a valid measure of the treatment effect,
can be clinically misleading and common sample size formulas are not
appropriate.
  In this paper, we study the hazard ratio along time of a two-component
composite endpoint under the assumption that the hazard ratio for each
component is constant.
  This work considers two measures for quantifying the non-proportionality of
the hazard ratio: the difference $D$ between the maximum and minimum values of
hazard ratio over time and the relative measure $R$ representing the ratio
between the sample sizes for the minimum detectable and the average effects. We
illustrate $D$ and $R$ by means of the ZODIAC trial where the primary endpoint
was progression-free survival.
  We have run a simulation study deriving scenarios for different values of the
hazard ratios, different event rates and different degrees of association
between the components. We illustrate situations that yield non-constant hazard
ratios for the composite endpoints and consider the likely impact on sample
size.
  Results show that the distance between the two component hazard ratios plays
an important role, especially when they are close to 1. Furthermore, even when
the treatment effects for each component are similar, if the two-component
hazards are markedly different, hazard ratio of the composite is often
non-constant.

attack. Under these conditions, the flow exhibits a vortex shedding limit
cycle. A reduced order model (ROM) of the flow field is extracted using proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD). Subsequently, a subspace system identification
algorithm (N4SID) is applied to extract directly the estimator matrices from
the reduced output of the system (the POD coefficients). We explore
systematically the effect of the number of states of the estimator, the sensor
location, the type of sensor measurements (one or both velocity components),
and the number of POD modes to be recovered. When the signal of a single
velocity component (in the stream wise or cross stream directions) is measured,
the reconstruction of the first two dominant POD modes strongly depends on the
sensor location. We explore this behaviour and provide a physical explanation
based on the non-linear mode interaction and the spatial distribution of the
modes. When however, both components are measured, the performance is very
robust, and is almost independent of the sensor location when the optimal
number of estimator states is used. Reconstruction of the less energetic modes

yet its exact impact on the behavior of neural networks is not well understood.
This study analyzes overfitting by examining how the distribution of logits
alters in relation to how much the model overfits. Specifically, we find that
when training with few data samples, the distribution of logit activations when
processing unseen test samples of an under-represented class tends to shift
towards and even across the decision boundary, while the over-represented class
seems unaffected. In image segmentation, foreground samples are often heavily
under-represented. We observe that sensitivity of the model drops as a result
of overfitting, while precision remains mostly stable. Based on our analysis,
we derive asymmetric modifications of existing loss functions and regularizers
including a large margin loss, focal loss, adversarial training and mixup,
which specifically aim at reducing the shift observed when embedding unseen
samples of the under-represented class. We study the case of binary
segmentation of brain tumor core and show that our proposed simple
modifications lead to significantly improved segmentation performance over the
symmetric variants.

underexposed photos tend to produce visually unpleasing results due to the
existence of visual artifacts (e.g., color distortion, loss of details and
uneven exposure). We observed that this is because they fail to ensure the
perceptual consistency of visual information between the source underexposed
image and its enhanced output. To obtain high-quality results free of these
artifacts, we present a novel underexposed photo enhancement approach that is
able to maintain the perceptual consistency. We achieve this by proposing an
effective criterion, referred to as perceptually bidirectional similarity,
which explicitly describes how to ensure the perceptual consistency.
Particularly, we adopt the Retinex theory and cast the enhancement problem as a
constrained illumination estimation optimization, where we formulate
perceptually bidirectional similarity as constraints on illumination and solve
for the illumination which can recover the desired artifact-free enhancement
results. In addition, we describe a video enhancement framework that adopts the
presented illumination estimation for handling underexposed videos. To this
end, a probabilistic approach is introduced to propagate illuminations of
sampled keyframes to the entire video by tackling a Bayesian Maximum A
Posteriori problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method over the state-of-the-art methods.

nonlinear dynamical systems governed by ordinary or partial differential
equations (ODEs or PDEs). This framework bounds from above the largest value of
an observable along trajectories that start from a chosen set and evolve over a
finite or infinite time interval. The approach needs no explicit trajectories.
Instead, it requires constructing suitably constrained auxiliary functions that
depend on the state variables and possibly on time. Minimizing bounds over
auxiliary functions is a convex problem dual to the non-convex maximization of
the observable along trajectories. This duality is strong, meaning that
auxiliary functions give arbitrarily sharp bounds, for sufficiently regular
ODEs evolving over a finite time on a compact domain. When these conditions
fail, strong duality may or may not hold; both situations are illustrated by
examples. We also show that near-optimal auxiliary functions can be used to
construct spacetime sets that localize trajectories leading to extreme events.
Finally, in the case of polynomial ODEs and observables, we describe how
polynomial auxiliary functions of fixed degree can be optimized numerically
using polynomial optimization. The corresponding bounds become sharp as the
polynomial degree is raised if strong duality and mild compactness assumptions
hold. Analytical and computational ODE examples illustrate the construction of
bounds and the identification of extreme trajectories, along with some
limitations. As an analytical PDE example, we bound the maximum fractional
enstrophy of solutions to the Burgers equation with fractional diffusion.

their decision making and exploration tasks. In the ideal case, these
recommendations, besides of being accurate, should also be novel and
explainable. However, up to now most platforms fail to provide both, novel
recommendations that advance users' exploration along with explanations to make
their reasoning more transparent to them. For instance, a well-known
recommendation algorithm, such as matrix factorisation (MF), optimises only the
accuracy criterion, while disregarding other quality criteria such as the
explainability or the novelty, of recommended items. In this paper, to the best
of our knowledge, we propose a new model, denoted as NEMF, that allows to
trade-off the MF performance with respect to the criteria of novelty and
explainability, while only minimally compromising on accuracy. In addition, we
recommend a new explainability metric based on nDCG, which distinguishes a more
explainable item from a less explainable item. An initial user study indicates
how users perceive the different attributes of these ""user"" style explanations
and our extensive experimental results demonstrate that we attain high accuracy
by recommending also novel and explainable items.

very well, and increase systematically when reducing the spatial resolution of
the map. Shifts of the northern and southern hemisphere are typically opposite
to each other. Shifts follow the evolution of the trailing flux and have a
strong solar cycle variation with maxima in the early to mid-declining phase of
the solar cycle. The sign of the hemispheric weak-field shift is always the

molecules in the UV range with the intense electromagnetic fields of plasmonic
nanostructures to promote surface-enhanced spectroscopy and catalysis.
Currently, aluminum is the most widely used metal for UV plasmonics, and is
generally assumed to be remarkably stable thanks to its natural alumina layer
passivating the metal surface. However, we find here that under 266 nm UV
illumination, aluminum can undergo a dramatic photocorrosion in water within a
few tens of seconds and even at low average UV powers. This aluminum
instability in water environments critically limits the UV plasmonics
applications. We show that the aluminum photocorrosion is related to the
nonlinear absorption by water in the UV range leading to the production of
hydroxyl radicals. Different corrosion protection approaches are tested using
scavengers for reactive oxygen species and polymer layers deposited on top of
the aluminum structures. Using optimized protection, we achieve a ten-fold
increase in the available UV power range leading to no visible photocorrosion
effects. This technique is crucial to achieve stable use of aluminum
nanostructures for UV plasmonics in aqueous solutions.

Markov process augmented with non-negative integer counters that can be

that would cause a counter to decrease below zero. The pVASS can be used as
abstractions of probabilistic programs with many decidable properties. The use
of pVASS as abstractions requires the presence of nondeterminism in the model.
In this paper, we develop techniques for checking fast termination of pVASS
with nondeterminism.
  That is, for every initial configuration of size n, we consider the worst
expected number of transitions needed to reach a configuration with some
counter negative (the expected termination time). We show that the problem
whether the asymptotic expected termination time is linear is decidable in

equation specialises to asking that the hermitian metric determining the
fibrewise Fubini-Study metric is Hermite-Einstein.
  Assuming the existence of an optimal symplectic connection, and the existence
of an appropriate twisted extremal metric on the base of the fibration, we show
that the total space of the fibration itself admits an extremal metric for
certain polarisations making the fibres small.

the cake) among agents with distinct preferences. Focusing on a standard
formulation of cake cutting, in which each agent must receive a contiguous
piece of the cake, this work establishes algorithmic and hardness results for
multiple fairness/efficiency measures.
  First, we consider the well-studied notion of envy-freeness and develop an
efficient algorithm that finds a cake division (with connected pieces) wherein
the envy is multiplicatively within a factor of 2+o(1). The same algorithm in
fact achieves an approximation ratio of 3+o(1) for the problem of finding cake
divisions with as large a Nash social welfare (NSW) as possible. NSW is another
standard measure of fairness and this work also establishes a connection
between envy-freeness and NSW: approximately envy-free cake divisions (with
connected pieces) always have near-optimal Nash social welfare. Furthermore, we
develop an approximation algorithm for maximizing the $\rho$-mean welfare--this
unifying objective, with different values of $\rho$, interpolates between
notions of fairness (NSW) and efficiency (average social welfare). Finally, we
complement these algorithmic results by proving that maximizing NSW (and, in

obtained by removing one or more number states from a coherent state. Phase
sensitivity of an interferometer is enhanced if these nonclassical states are
used as input states. The optimal phase sensitivity, which is related to the
quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) for the input state, improves beyond the
standard quantum limit. It is argued that removal of more than one suitable
number state leads to better phase sensitivity. As an important limiting case
in this context, the even and odd coherent states, where the odd and even
number states are filtered from coherent state respectively, are considered.
The optimal phase sensitivity for these limiting cases equals that of the

mechanisms, through which developers can highlight the presence of bugs through
bug reports, i.e., textual descriptions reporting the problem and what are the
steps that led to a failure. In past and recent years, the research community
deeply investigated methods for easing bug triage, that is, the process of
assigning the fixing of a reported bug to the most qualified developer.
Nevertheless, only a few studies have reported on how to support developers in
the process of understanding the type of a reported bug, which is the first and
most time-consuming step to perform before assigning a bug-fix operation. In
this paper, we target this problem in two ways: first, we analyze 1,280 bug
reports of 119 popular projects belonging to three ecosystems such as Mozilla,
Apache, and Eclipse, with the aim of building a taxonomy of the root causes of
reported bugs; then, we devise and evaluate an automated classification model
able to classify reported bugs according to the defined taxonomy. As a result,
we found nine main common root causes of bugs over the considered systems.
Moreover, our model achieves high F-Measure and AUC-ROC (64% and 74% on

that the abnormally long $T_2^*$ is due to the controllable freezing of the

are supported by a nearly parameter-free modeling of the $^{29}$Si nuclear spin
dynamics, which reveals the degree of back-action provided by the electron spin

discover aspects of their behavior and ensure their correct functioning.
Although this theory is widely used, e.g., to check conformance of protocol
implementations, its applicability is limited by restrictions of the FSM
framework: the fact that inputs and outputs alternate in an FSM, and outputs
are fully determined by the previous input and state. Labeled Transition
Systems with inputs and outputs (LTSs), as studied in ioco testing theory,
provide a richer framework for testing component oriented systems, but lack the
algorithms for test generation from FSM theory.
  In this article, we propose an algorithm for the fundamental problem of state
identification during testing of LTSs. Our algorithm is a direct generalization
of the well-known algorithm for computing adaptive distinguishing sequences for
FSMs proposed by Lee & Yannakakis. Our algorithm has to deal with so-called
compatible states, states that cannot be distinguished in case of an
adversarial system-under-test. Analogous to the result of Lee & Yannakakis, we
prove that if an (adaptive) test exists that distinguishes all pairs of
incompatible states of an LTS, our algorithm will find one. In practice, such
adaptive tests typically do not exist. However, in experiments with an
implementation of our algorithm on an industrial benchmark, we find that tests
produced by our algorithm still distinguish more than 99% of the incompatible
state pairs.

directly dependent on another (grasping) removes the need of sparse rewards,

commenting on a more physically realistic potential relevant for the standard
model Higgs. For bubbles with large backreaction, the extra dimension has a
dramatic effect on the tunnelling rate, however, for the weakly backreacting
bubbles more relevant for realistic Standard Model potentials, the extra
dimension has little impact.

Reconstruction Inversion (WRI), offers potential benefits of decreasing the
nonlinearity of the inverse problem by replacing the explicit inverse of the
ill-conditioned wave-equation operator of classical FWI (the oscillating Green
functions) with a suitably defined data-driven regularized inverse. This
regularization relaxes the wave-equation constraint to reconstruct wavefields
that match the data, hence mitigating the risk of cycle skipping. The
subsurface model parameters are then updated in a direction that reduces these
constraint violations. However, in the case of a rough initial model, the phase
errors in the reconstructed wavefields may trap the waveform inversion in a
local minimum leading to inaccurate subsurface models. In this paper, in order
to avoid matching such incorrect phase information during the early WRI
iterations, we design a new cost function based upon phase retrieval, namely a
process which seeks to reconstruct a signal from the amplitude of linear
measurements. This new formulation, called Wavefield Inversion with Phase
Retrieval (WIPR), further improves the robustness of the parameter estimation
subproblem by a suitable phase correction. We implement the resulting WIPR
problem with an alternating-direction approach, which combines the
Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm to linearise the phase-retrieval term
and a variable splitting technique based upon the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM). This new workflow equipped with Tikhonov-total variation
(TT) regularization, which is the combination of second-order Tikhonov and
total variation regularizations and bound constraints, successfully
reconstructs the 2004 BP salt model from a sparse fixed-spread acquisition
using a 3~Hz starting frequency and a homogeneous initial velocity model.

assignment of jobs to servers if queue-states cannot be queried by the
dispatcher? A replication strategy has recently been proposed where $d$ copies
of each arriving job are sent to servers chosen at random. The job's completion
time is the first time that the service of any of its copies is complete. On
completion, redundant copies of the job are removed from other queues so as not
to overburden the system.
  For digital jobs, where the objects to be served can be algebraically
manipulated, and for servers whose output is a linear function of their input,
here we consider an alternate strategy: Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes.
For every batch of $n$ digital jobs that arrive, $n+m$ linear combinations are
created over the reals or a large finite field, and each coded job is sent to a
random server. The batch completion time is the first time that any $n$ of the
$n+m$ coded jobs are served, as the evaluation of $n$ original jobs can be
recovered by Gaussian elimination. If redundant jobs can be removed from queues
on batch completion, we establish that in order to get the improved
response-time performance of sending $d$ copies of each of $n$ jobs via the
replication strategy, with the MDS methodology it suffices to send $n+d$ jobs.
That is, while replication is multiplicative, MDS is linear.

the fact that they only analyze simulated job interviews (e.g. students
pretending to apply for a fake position). Asynchronous video interviewing tools
have become mature products on the human resources market, and thus, a popular
step in the recruitment process. As part of a project to help recruiters, we
collected a corpus of more than 7000 candidates having asynchronous video job
interviews for real positions and recording videos of themselves answering a
set of questions. We propose a new hierarchical attention model called HireNet
that aims at predicting the hirability of the candidates as evaluated by
recruiters. In HireNet, an interview is considered as a sequence of questions
and answers containing salient socials signals. Two contextual sources of
information are modeled in HireNet: the words contained in the question and in
the job position. Our model achieves better F1-scores than previous approaches
for each modality (verbal content, audio and video). Results from early and
late multimodal fusion suggest that more sophisticated fusion schemes are
needed to improve on the monomodal results. Finally, some examples of moments
captured by the attention mechanisms suggest our model could potentially be

largest and oldest software repositories as of publication, PyPI provides
insight not just into the Python ecosystem today, but also trends in software
development and licensing more broadly over time. Within PyPI, we find that the
growth of the repository has been robust under all measures, with a compound
annual growth rate of 47% for active packages, 39% for new authors, and 61% for
new import statements over the last 15 years. As with many similar social
systems, we find a number of highly right-skewed distributions, including the
distribution of releases per package, packages and releases per author, imports
per package, and size per package and release. However, we also find that most
packages are contributed by single individuals, not multiple individuals or

formalism for the Turaev-Viro model (with $\Lambda < 0$), allowing to quantize
3D Euclidean gravity with a (negative) cosmological constant using a quantum
deformation of the gauge group. We describe its application to the 2-torus,
explicitly writing the $q$-deformed gauge symmetries and deriving the reduced
physical phase space of Dirac observables, which leads back to the Goldman
brackets for the moduli space of flat connections. Furthermore it turns out
that the $q$-deformed loop gravity can be derived through a gauge fixing from
the Fock-Rosly bracket, which provides an explicit link between loop quantum
gravity (for $q$ real) and the combinatorial quantization of 3d gravity as a
Chern-Simons theory with non-vanishing cosmological constant $\Lambda<0$. A
side-product is the reformulation of the loop quantum gravity phase space for
vanishing cosmological constant $\Lambda=0$, based on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$
holonomies and $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ fluxes, in terms of $\mathrm{ISU}(2)$
Poincar\'e holonomies. Although we focus on the case of the torus as an
example, our results outline the general equivalence between 3D $q$-deformed
loop quantum gravity and the combinatorial quantization of Chern-Simons theory

and $W$ denotes the largest weight. This can be used to approximate several
graph characteristics including the diameter, radius, median, minimum-weight

  Since Zwick's algorithm uses the scaling technique, it has a factor $\log W$
in the running time. In this paper, we study whether APSP and related problems
admit approximation schemes avoiding the scaling technique. That is, the number
of arithmetic operations should be independent of $W$; this is called strongly
polynomial. Our main results are as follows.
  - We design approximation schemes in strongly polynomial time
$O(\frac{n^\omega}{\varepsilon} \text{polylog}(\frac{n}{\varepsilon}))$ for
APSP on undirected graphs as well as for the graph characteristics diameter,
radius, median, minimum-weight triangle, and minimum-weight cycle on directed

  - For APSP on directed graphs we design an approximation scheme in strongly
polynomial time $O(n^{\frac{\omega + 3}{2}} \varepsilon^{-1}

best exact algorithm.
  - We explain why our approximation scheme for APSP on directed graphs has a
worse exponent than $\omega$: Any improvement over our exponent $\frac{\omega +
3}{2}$ would improve the best known algorithm for Min-Max Product In fact, we
prove that approximating directed APSP and exactly computing the Min-Max

perspective, we can also observe that the model admits a competitive exclusion
(the results are different from the corresponding ODE model). More importantly,
our model shows the complexity of the short term (6 days) co-cultured cell
distribution depending on the initial distribution of each species. Through
numerical simulations, the impact of the initial distribution on the population
ratio lies in the initial total cell number and our study shows that the

in this paper we propose to learn efficient deep object detectors through
channel pruning of convolutional layers. To this end, we enforce channel-level
sparsity of convolutional layers by imposing L1 regularization on channel
scaling factors and prune less informative feature channels to obtain ""slim""
object detectors. Based on such approach, we present SlimYOLOv3 with fewer
trainable parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) in comparison of
original YOLOv3 (Joseph Redmon et al., 2018) as a promising solution for
real-time object detection on UAVs. We evaluate SlimYOLOv3 on VisDrone2018-Det

of unpruned counterpart, including ~90.8% decrease of FLOPs, ~92.0% decline of
parameter size, running ~2 times faster and comparable detection accuracy as
YOLOv3. Experimental results with different pruning ratios consistently verify
that proposed SlimYOLOv3 with narrower structure are more efficient, faster and
better than YOLOv3, and thus are more suitable for real-time object detection
on UAVs. Our codes are made publicly available at

close enough to be tidally locked. Some recent works have cast doubt on the
ability of planets orbiting RDs to support life. In contrast, it is shown that
temperatures suitable for liquid water and even for organic molecules may exist
on tidally locked planets of RDs for a wide range of atmospheres. We chart the
surface temperature distribution as a function of the irradiation, greenhouse
factor and heat circulation. The habitability boundaries and their dependence
on the atmospheric properties are derived. Extending our previous analyses of
tidally locked planets, we find that tidally locked as well as synchronous (not
completely locked) planets of RDs and K-type stars may support life, for a
wider range of orbital distance and atmospheric conditions than previously
thought. In particular, it is argued that life clement environments may be
possible on tidally locked and synchronously orbiting planets of RDs and K-type
stars, with conditions supporting Oxygenic Photosynthesis, which on Earth was a
key to Complex life. Different climate projections and the biological
significance of tidal locking on putative complex life are reviewed. We show
that when the effect of continuous radiation is taken into account, the
Photo-synthetically Active Radiation (PAR) available on tidally locked planets,
even of RDs, could produce a high Potential Plant Productivity, in analogy to
mid-summer growth at high latitudes on Earth. Awaiting the findings of TESS and

sensing attention on mobile devices in the wild, including the impact of face

the energy that is dissipated at small scales by various kinetic processes.
Understanding the characteristics of such dissipative mechanisms requires the
accurate knowledge of the fluctuations that make energy available for
conversion at small scales, as different dissipation processes are triggered by
fluctuations of a different nature. The scaling properties of different energy
channels are estimated here using a proxy of the local energy transfer, based
on the third-order moment scaling law for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. In
particular, the sign-singularity analysis was used to explore the scaling
properties of the alternating positive-negative energy fluxes, thus providing
information on the structure and topology of such fluxes for each of the
different type of fluctuations. The results show the highly complex geometrical
nature of the flux, and that the local contributions associated with energy and
cross-helicity nonlinear transfer have similar scaling properties.
Consequently, the fractal properties of current and vorticity structures are
similar to those of the Alfv\'enic fluctuations.

fully-simulated data, as well as how their different compositions affect
network performance. We show that fewer hand labelled lightcurves can be

robustness, and efficiency of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). In
this paper, we propose a novel approach of regulating DCNN convolutional
kernels by a structured filter bank. Comparing with the existing regularization
methods, such as $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ minimization of DCNN kernel weights and
the kernel orthogonality, which ignore sample correlations within a kernel, the
use of filter bank in regularization of DCNNs can mold the DCNN kernels to
common spatial structures and features (e.g., edges or textures of various
orientations and frequencies) of natural images. On the other hand, unlike
directly making DCNN kernels fixed filters, the filter bank regularization
still allows the freedom of optimizing DCNN weights via deep learning. This new
DCNN design strategy aims to combine the best of two worlds: the inclusion of
structural image priors of traditional filter banks to improve the robustness
and generality of DCNN solutions and the capability of modern deep learning to
model complex non-linear functions hidden in training data. Experimental
results on object recognition tasks show that the proposed regularization
approach guides DCNNs to faster convergence and better generalization than
existing regularization methods of weight decay and kernel orthogonality.

image classification and semantic segmentation, numerous CNN-based methods with

notorious instability and slow convergence of depth value regression during
training, MultiDepth makes use of depth interval classification as an auxiliary
task. The auxiliary task can be disabled at test-time to predict continuous
depth values using the main regression branch more efficiently. We applied
MultiDepth to road scenes and present results on the KITTI depth prediction

rapidly merge to build up the larger cluster, in combination with continual
accretion of gas from the cloud. These cluster formation histories naturally
produce a diversity of abundance patterns across the massive cluster

telescope at the South Pole consisting of an array of radio antennas aimed at
detecting the Askaryan radiation produced by neutrino interactions in the ice.
Currently, the experiment has five stations in operation that have been
deployed in stages since 2012. This contribution focuses on the development of
a search for a diffuse flux of neutrinos in two ARA stations (A2 and A3) from
2013-2016. A background of $\sim 0.01-0.02$ events is expected in one station
in each of two search channels in horizontal- and vertical-polarizations. The
expected new constraints on the flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos based on
four years of analysis with two stations improve on the previous limits set by
ARA by a factor of about two. The projected sensitivity of ARA's five-station
dataset is beginning to be competitive with other neutrino telescopes at high
energies near $10^{10.5}\,$GeV.

doubly negative branch, a degenerate Dirac cone is achieved. Different
polarization-dependent propagation along the same primary direction along the

phenomena along different primary directions along a given branch are also
reported. By imposing two large space-inversion symmetry (SIS) breaking
perturbations the topological phase transition is obtained. We show that the
Berry curvature becomes strongly anisotropic when the wave vector gets away
from the valleys. Further, we demonstrate the unidirectional transport of A0,
S0, and SH0 Lamb waves at different domain walls in straight or Z-shape wave
guides. In the large SIS breaking case, we show negligible reflection at the
zigzag outlet of the straight wave guide and occurrence of weak inter-valley
scattering at the bending corners of the Z-shape wave guide. For a larger
strength of SIS breaking, the edge states are gapped and strong reflection at
the zigzag outlet and bending corners is observed. The topological protection
cannot be guaranteed any more in that case.

arises. How can a machine learning representation characterizing a cyber attack

if each networks has wildly different distributions of benign and malicious
traffic? We address this issue by comparing the results of naively transferring
a model across network domains and using CORrelation ALignment, to our novel
adversarial Siamese neural network. Our proposed model learns attack
representations that are more invariant to each network's particularities via
an adversarial approach. It uses a simple ranking loss that prioritizes the
labeling of the most egregious malicious events correctly over average
accuracy. This is appropriate for driving an alert triage workflow wherein an
analyst only has time to inspect the top few events ranked highest by the
model. In terms of accuracy, the other approaches fail completely to detect any
malicious events when models were trained on one dataset are evaluated on
another for the first 100 events. While, the method presented here retrieves
sizable proportions of malicious events, at the expense of some training
instabilities due in adversarial modeling. We evaluate these approaches using 2
publicly available networking datasets, and suggest areas for future research.

with a 2.67-days period. The planet exhibited strong transit timing variations
(TTVs) of greater than 30 minutes, indicative of the presence of a further
object in the system. Here we report the discovery of the previously undetected
outer planet, K2-146 c, in the system using additional photometric data. K2-146
c was found to have a grazing transit geometry and a 3.97-day period. The outer
planet was only significantly detected in the latter K2 campaigns presumably
because of precession of its orbital plane. The TTVs of K2-146 b and c were
measured using observations spanning a baseline of almost 1200 days. We found
strong anti-correlation in the TTVs, suggesting the two planets are
gravitationally interacting. Our TTV and transit model analyses revealed that
K2-146 b has a radius of 2.25 $\pm$ 0.10 \R_earth and a mass of 5.6 $\pm$ 0.7
M_earth, whereas K2-146 c has a radius of $2.59_{-0.39}^{+1.81}$ R_earth and a
mass of 7.1 $\pm$ 0.9 M_earth. The inner and outer planets likely have moderate
eccentricities of $e = 0.14 \pm 0.07$ and $0.16 \pm 0.07$, respectively.
Long-term numerical integrations of the two-planet orbital solution show that
it can be dynamically stable for at least 2 Myr. The evaluation of the
resonance angles of the planet pair indicates that K2-146 b and c are likely
trapped in a 3:2 mean motion resonance. The orbital architecture of the system
points to a possible convergent migration origin.

generation was realized by the magnetoelastic effect by applying normal and
shear strain components, as well as by the Oersted field emitted by an
inductive antenna. The magnetoelastic excitation field has a nonuniform profile
over the width of the waveguide because of the nonuniform magnetization
orientation, whereas the Oersted field remains uniform. Using micromagnetic
simulations, we indicate that both types of excitation fields generate
quantised width modes with both odd and even mode numbers as well as tilted
phase fronts. We demonstrate that these effects originate from the average
magnetization orientation with respect to the main axes of the magnetic
waveguide. Furthermore, it is indicated that the excitation efficiency of the
second-order mode generally surpasses that of the first-order mode due to their
symmetry. The relative intensity of the excited modes can be controlled by the
strain state as well as by tuning the dimensions of the excitation area.
Finally, we demonstrate that the nonreciprocity of spin-wave radiation due to

is reduced to the finite-dimensional generalized spectral problem, whose

the Lindbladian acting on each spatial domain using only observables within

the linear diffusion flux is substituted by the mean curvature operator both in

decades because of many practical applications. Some are related to common

more advanced problems such as pattern detection in Artificial Intelligence and
Bioinformatics. Tens of algorithms and methodologies have been developed for
pattern matching and several programming languages, packages, applications and
online systems exist that can perform exact string matching in biological
sequences. These techniques, however, are limited to searching for specific and
predefined strings in a sequence. In this paper a novel methodology (called
Ex2SM) is presented, which is a pipeline of execution of advanced data
structures and algorithms, explicitly designed for text mining, that can detect
every possible repeated string in multivariate biological sequences. In
contrast to known algorithms in literature, the methodology presented here is
string agnostic, i.e., it does not require an input string to search for it,
rather it can detect every string that exists at least twice, regardless of its
attributes such as length, frequency, alphabet, overlapping etc. The complexity
of the problem solved and the potential of the proposed methodology is
demonstrated with the experimental analysis performed on the entire human
genome. More specifically, all repeated strings with a length of up to 50
characters have been detected, an achievement which is practically impossible
using other algorithms due to the exponential number of possible permutations

inside of a transversely polarized proton, is only accessible through channels
that couple $h_1 \left(x\right)$ to another chiral odd distribution, such as
the Collins fragmentation function ($\Delta^N
D_{\pi/q^\uparrow}\left(z,j_T\right)$). Significant Collins asymmetries of
charged pions have been observed in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering
(SIDIS) data. These SIDIS asymmetries combined with $e^+e^-$ process
asymmetries have allowed for the extraction of $h_1\left(x\right)$ and
$\Delta^N D_{\pi/q^\uparrow}\left(z,j_T\right)$. However, the current
uncertainties on $h_1\left(x\right)$ are large compared to the corresponding
quark momentum and helicity distributions and reflect the limited statistics
and kinematic reach of the available data. In transversely polarized hadronic
collisions, Collins asymmetries may be isolated and extracted by measuring the
spin dependent azimuthal distributions of charged pions in jets. This thesis
will report on the first statistically significant Collins asymmetries
extracted from $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV hadronic collisions using $14$ pb$^{-1}$ of
transversely polarized proton collisions at 57% average polarization.

overapproximation for nonlinear systems with polynomial dynamics, which

traditional time-step based methods in dealing with those nonlinear dynamical
systems in which there is a large difference in speed between trajectories,
producing an overapproximation that is time independent. However, the existing
approach for PBT is not efficient due to the application of interval methods
for enclosure-box computation, and it can only deal with continuous dynamical
systems without uncertainty. In this paper, we extend the approach with the
ability to handle both continuous and hybrid dynamical systems with uncertainty
that can reside in parameters and/or noise. We also improve the efficiency of
the method significantly, by avoiding the use of interval-based methods for the
enclosure-box computation without loosing soundness. We have developed a C++
prototype implementing the proposed approach and we evaluate it on several
benchmarks. The experiments show that our approach is more efficient and

information retrieval (IR) systems, for that knowledge base has numerous
relations between entities which can help the IR systems to conduct inference
from one entity to another entity. Relation extraction is one of the
fundamental techniques to construct a knowledge base. Distant supervision is a
semi-supervised learning method for relation extraction which learns with
labeled and unlabeled data. However, this approach suffers the problem of
relation overlapping in which one entity tuple may have multiple relation
facts. We believe that relation types can have latent connections, which we
call class ties, and can be exploited to enhance relation extraction. However,
this property between relation classes has not been fully explored before. In
this paper, to exploit class ties between relations to improve relation
extraction, we propose a general ranking based multi-label learning framework
combined with convolutional neural networks, in which ranking based loss
functions with regularization technique are introduced to learn the latent
connections between relations. Furthermore, to deal with the problem of class
imbalance in distant supervision relation extraction, we further adopt
cost-sensitive learning to rescale the costs from the positive and negative
labels. Extensive experiments on a widely used dataset show the effectiveness
of our model to exploit class ties and to relieve class imbalance problem.

(4.61/5), post-implementation impact (4.78/5) and evidence direction (4.26/5).
Experts somewhat agreed to one criterion; post-implementation impact levels

potential effect (2.97/5). Experts also provided recommendations to six
open-ended questions regarding adding, removing or changing evaluation
criteria. The GRASP concept and its detailed report were updated then the

of evaluation; 2) Level of evidence; and 3) Direction of evidence. The final
grade of a tool is based on the highest phase of evaluation, supported by the

distance to the system is $D_{L} = 4.23^{+1.51}_{-1.64}$kpc. The projected
star-planet separation is $a_{\perp} = 2.07^{+0.65}_{-0.77}$AU. The lens-source
relative proper motion of the event is quite high, at $\sim 7.1 \, {\rm
mas/yr}$. Therefore, we may be able to determine the lens physical parameters
uniquely or place much stronger constraints on them by measuring the
color-dependent centroid shift and/or the image elongation with additional high
resolution imaging already a few years from now.

open waveguides is presented. It relies on a full vector description given by
Maxwell's equations in the framework of the finite element method. The
discontinuities are not necessarily small perturbations of the initial
waveguide and can be very general, such as plasmonic inclusions of arbitrary
shapes. The leaky modes of the invariant structure are first computed and then
injected as incident fields in the full structure with obstacles using a
scattered field approach. The resulting scattered field is finally projected on
the modes of the invariant structure making use of their bi-orthogonality. The
energy balance is discussed. Finally, the modes of open waveguides periodically
structured along the propagation direction are computed. The relevant complex
propagation constants are compared to the transmission obtained for a finite
number of identical cells. The relevance and complementarity of the two
approaches are highlighted on a numerical example encountered in infrared
sensing. Open source models allowing to retrieve most of the results of this

finite sample bias of estimators. For example, the maximum likelihood estimator
has a bias that can result in a significant inferential loss. This problem is
typically magnified in high-dimensional settings where the number of variables
$p$ is allowed to diverge with the sample size $n$. However, it is generally
difficult to establish whether an estimator is unbiased and therefore its
asymptotic order is a common approach used (in low-dimensional settings) to
quantify the magnitude of the bias. As an alternative, we introduce a new and
stronger property, possibly for high-dimensional settings, called phase
transition unbiasedness. An estimator satisfying this property is unbiased for
all $n$ greater than a finite sample size $n^\ast$. Moreover, we propose a
phase transition unbiased estimator built upon the idea of matching an initial
estimator computed on the sample and on simulated data. It is not required for
this initial estimator to be consistent and thus it can be chosen for its
computational efficiency and/or for other desirable properties such as
robustness. This estimator can be computed using a suitable simulation based
algorithm, namely the iterative bootstrap, which is shown to converge
exponentially fast. In addition, we demonstrate the consistency and the
limiting distribution of this estimator in high-dimensional settings. Finally,
as an illustration, we use our approach to develop new estimators for the
logistic regression model, with and without random effects, that also enjoy
other properties such as robustness to data contamination and are also not
affected by the problem of separability. In a simulation exercise, the
theoretical results are confirmed in settings where the sample size is
relatively small compared to the model dimension.

Existing approaches often require tedious capturing procedures and long
processing time, which limit their practical use. In this paper, we formulate
transparent object matting as a refractive flow estimation problem, and propose
a deep learning framework, called TOM-Net, for learning the refractive flow.
Our framework comprises two parts, namely a multi-scale encoder-decoder network
for producing a coarse prediction, and a residual network for refinement. At
test time, TOM-Net takes a single image as input, and outputs a matte
(consisting of an object mask, an attenuation mask and a refractive flow field)
in a fast feed-forward pass. As no off-the-shelf dataset is available for
transparent object matting, we create a large-scale synthetic dataset
consisting of $178K$ images of transparent objects rendered in front of images
sampled from the Microsoft COCO dataset. We also capture a real dataset
consisting of $876$ samples using $14$ transparent objects and $60$ background
images. Besides, we show that our method can be easily extended to handle the
cases where a trimap or a background image is available.Promising experimental
results have been achieved on both synthetic and real data, which clearly
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

continuous and non random, and $\eta$ is a centered Gaussian noise that is
white in time and colored in space, with a possibly-signed homogeneous spatial
correlation $f$. If, in addition, $u(0)\equiv1$, then we prove that, under a
mild decay condition on $f$, the process $x\mapsto u(t\,,x)$ is stationary and
ergodic at all times $t>0$. It has been argued that, when coupled with moment
estimates, spatial ergodicity of $u$ teaches us about the intermittent nature
of the solution to such SPDEs \cite{BertiniCancrini1995,KhCBMS}.
  Our results provide rigorous justification of such discussions.
  Our methods hinge on novel facts from harmonic analysis and functions of
positive type, as well as from Malliavin calculus and Poincar\'e inequalities.
  We further showcase the utility of these Poincar\'e inequalities by: (a)
describing conditions that ensure that the random field $u(t)$ is mixing for
every $t>0$; and by (b) giving a quick proof of a conjecture of Conus et al
\cite{CJK12} about the ""size"" of the intermittency islands of $u$.

supply and can only operate at low power and low rate. In this paper, we
investigate a cellular-based IoT system combined with energy harvesting and
NOMA. We consider all base stations (BS) and IoT devices follow the Poisson
Point Process (PPP) distribution in a given area. The unit time slot is divided
into two phases, energy harvesting phase in downlink (DL) and data transmission
phase in uplink (uplink). That is, IoT devices will first harvest energy from
all BS transmissions and then use the harvested energy to do the NOMA
information transmission. We define an energy harvesting circle within which
all IoT devices can harvest enough energy for NOMA transmission. The design
objective is to maximize the total throughput in uplink within the circle by
varying the duration T of energy harvesting phase. In our work, we also
consider the inter-cell interference in the throughput calculation. The
analysis of Probability Mass Function (PMF) for IoT devices in the energy
harvesting circle is also compared with simulation results. It is shown that
the BS density needs to be carefully set so that the IoT devices in the energy
harvesting circle receive relatively smaller interference and energy circles
overlap only with a small probability. Our simulations show that there exists
an optimal T to achieve the maximum throughput. When the BSs are densely
deployed consequently the total throughput will decrease because of the
interference.

relies on echocardiography (ECHO), which costs thousands of dollars and medical

users to administer diagnoses themselves. An inexpensive, custom designed

upload audio of their heart to a database. Using a deep learning network
architecture, the database classifies the audio and returns the diagnosis to
the user. The model consists of a deep recurrent convolutional neural network
trained on 300 prelabeled heartbeat audio samples. After the model was
validated on a previously unseen set of 100 heartbeat audio samples, it
achieved a f beta score of 0.9545 and an accuracy of 95.5 percent. This value
exceeds that of clinical examination accuracy, which is around 83 percent to 91

injection as a method to diversify recommendations. We use Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture, where both the encoder and decoder
are conditioned on a user profile learned from item content data. This allows
us to apply style transfer methodologies to the task of recommendations, which
we refer to as injection. To enable style injection, user profiles are learned
to be interpretable such that they express users' propensities for specific
predefined styles. These are learned via label-propagation from a dataset of
item content, with limited labeled points. To perform injection, the condition
on the encoder is learned while the condition on the decoder is selected per
explicit feedback. Explicit feedback can be taken either from a user's response
to a style or interest quiz, or from item ratings. In the absence of explicit
feedback, the condition at the encoder is applied to the decoder. We show a 12%
improvement on NDCG@20 over the traditional VAE based approach and an average
22% improvement on AUC across all classes for predicting user style profiles
against our best performing baseline. After injecting styles we compare the
user style profile to the style of the recommendations and show that injected
styles have an average +133% increase in presence. Our results show that style
injection is a powerful method to diversify recommendations while maintaining
personal relevance. Our main contribution is an application of a
semi-supervised approach that extends item labels to interpretable user
profiles.

We are able to grasp highly abstract
notions, whether they come from art perception or pure mathematics. Current
machine learning techniques demonstrate astonishing results in extracting
patterns in information. Yet the abstract notions we possess are more than just
statistical patterns in the incoming information. Sensorimotor theory suggests
that they represent functions, laws, describing how the information can be
transformed, or, in other words, they represent the statistics of sensorimotor
changes rather than sensory inputs themselves. The aim of our work is to
suggest a way for machine learning and sensorimotor theory to benefit from each
other so as to pave the way toward new horizons in learning. We show in this
study that a highly abstract notion, that of space, can be seen as a collection
of laws of transformations of sensory information and that these laws could in
theory be learned by a naive agent. As an illustration we do a one-dimensional
simulation in which an agent extracts spatial knowledge in the form of
internalized (""sensible"") rigid displacements. The agent uses them to encode
its own displacements in a way which is isometrically related to external
space. Though the algorithm allowing acquisition of rigid displacements is
designed \emph{ad hoc}, we believe it can stimulate the development of
unsupervised learning techniques leading to similar results.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a new deep learning method for WSL,
composed of a localizer and a classifier, where the localizer is constrained to
determine relevant and irrelevant regions using conditional entropy (CE) with
the aim to reduce false positive regions. Experimental results on a public

this paper speaks of the tractability of the general concept lattice for both
its lattice structure and logic content. The general concept lattice permits a
feasible construction that can be completed in a single scan of the formal
context, though the conventional formal-concept lattice and rough-set lattice
can be regained from the general concept lattice. The logic implication
deducible from the general concept lattice takes the form of {\mu}_1
{\rightarrow} {\mu}_2 where {\mu}_1,{\mu}_2 {\in} M^{\ast} are composite
attributes out of the concerned formal attributes M. Remarkable is that with a
single formula based on the contextual truth 1_{\eta} one can deduce all the
implication relations extractable from the formal context. For concreteness, it
can be shown that any implication A {\rightarrow} B (A, B being subsets of the
formal attributes M) discussed in the formal-concept lattice corresponds to a
special case of {\mu}_1 {\rightarrow} {\mu}_2 by means of {\mu}_1 = {\prod} A
and {\mu}_2 = {\prod} B. Thus, one may elude the intractability due to
searching for the Guigues-Duquenne basis appropriate for the implication
relations deducible from the formal-concept lattice. Likewise, one may identify
those {\mu}_1 {\rightarrow} {\mu}_2 where {\mu}_1 = {\sum} A and {\mu}_2 =
{\sum} B with the implications that can be acquired from the rough-set lattice.

maximum performance of many geometry-sensitive nanoscale functional devices.
However, accurate metrology at the nanoscale is difficult using optics-based
methods due to the diffraction limit. In this article, we propose an optical
nano-profilometry framework with convolutional neural networks, which can
retrieve deep sub-wavelength geometrical profiles of nanostructures from their
optical images or scattering spectra. The generality, efficiency, and accuracy
of the proposed framework are validated by performing two different
measurements on three distinct nanostructures. We believe this work may
catalyze more explorations of optics-based nano-metrology with deep learning.

  during dental laser operation","5 pages, 2 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dental laser has been developed recently and gradually replaced the
conventional dental treatment methods, especially in dental caries removal. The
utility of laser in dentistry contributes to reduce the pain during surgery and
decrease the risk of sequelae after surgery. Although bringing about several
beneficial properties such as excellent directionality, high speed, ultra-tiny
active area and tunable energy concentration, laser is still quite limited in
dental surgery because of the difficulty in real-time high precision detection
of laser focus during the operation. In this study, a cutting-edge optical
system for real-time focus detection during dental laser operation employing
the quantum entanglement of photon pairs created via spontaneous parametric
downconversion (SPDC) is presented. Defocusing distance of the specimen which
is used as the sample tooth can be determined precisely through spatial
correlation of photons arriving at the detectors. The proposed technique can be
applied to design automatic focus detection system for use in dental laser
operation.

during the last decade, they remain highly specialized tools, which are trained
-- often from scratch -- to solve each particular task. The human brain, in
contrast, significantly re-uses existing capacities when learning to solve new
tasks. In the current study we explore a block-modular architecture for DNNs,
which allows parts of the existing network to be re-used to solve a new task
without a decrease in performance when solving the original task. We show that
networks with such architectures can outperform networks trained from scratch,
or perform comparably, while having to learn nearly 10 times fewer weights than
the networks trained from scratch.

  Copyright 2019 IEEE",,,,"cs.CY cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly pervasive
and relevant in many different application areas. Researchers are putting a
considerable effort to take full advantage of the power of AI, while trying to
overcome the technical challenges that are intrinsically linked to almost any
domain area of application, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the
biggest problems related to the use of AI in IoT is related to the difficulty
of coping with the wide variety of protocols and software technologies used, as
well as with the heterogeneity of the hardware resources consuming the AI. The
scattered IoT landscape accentuates the limitations on interoperability,
especially visible in the deployment of AI, affecting the seamless AI
life-cycle management as well. In this paper, it is discussed how to enable AI
distribution in IoT by introducing a layered intelligence architecture that
aims to face the undertaken challenges taking into account the special
requirements of nowadays IoT networks. It describes the main characteristics of
the new paradigm architecture, highlighting what are the implications of its
adoption from use cases perspective and their requirements. Finally, a set of
open technical and research challenges are enumerated to reach the full
potential of the intelligence distribution's vision.

  Intelligence Magazine (Copyright IEEE)",,,,"cs.CY cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine Intelligence (MI) technologies have revolutionized the design and
applications of computational intelligence systems, by introducing remarkable
scientific and technological enhancements across domains. MI can improve
Internet of Things (IoT) in several ways, such as optimizing the management of
large volumes of data or improving automation and transmission in large-scale
IoT deployments. When considering MI in the IoT context, MI services deployment
must account for the latency demands and network bandwidth requirements. To
this extent, moving the intelligence towards the IoT end-device aims to address
such requirements and introduces the notion of Distributed MI (D-MI) also in
the IoT context. However, current D-MI deployments are limited by the lack of
MI interoperability. Currently, the intelligence is tightly bound to the
application that exploits it, limiting the provisioning of that specific
intelligence service to additional applications. The objective of this article
is to propose a novel approach to cope with such constraints. It focuses on
decoupling the intelligence from the application by revising the traditional
device's stack and introducing an intelligence layer that provides services to
the overlying application layer. This paradigm aims to provide final users with
more control and accessibility of intelligence services by boosting providers'
incentives to develop solutions that could theoretically reach any device.
Based on the definition of this emerging paradigm, we explore several aspects
related to the intelligence distribution and its impact in the whole MI
ecosystem.

Nature of Order, wholeness is defined as a mathematical structure of physical
space in our surroundings. Yet, there was no mathematics, as Alexander admitted
then, that was powerful enough to capture his notion of wholeness. Recently, a
mathematical model of wholeness, together with its topological representation,
has been developed that is capable of addressing not only why a space is good,
but also how much goodness the space has. This paper develops a structural
perspective on goodness of space - both large- and small-scale - in order to
bridge two basic concepts of space and place through the very concept of
wholeness. The wholeness provides a de facto recursive definition of goodness
of space from a holistic and organic point of view. A space is good, genuinely
and objectively, if its adjacent spaces are good, the larger space to which it
belongs is good, and what is contained in the space is also good. Eventually,
goodness of space - sustainability of space - is considered a matter of fact
rather than of opinion under the new view of space: space is neither lifeless
nor neutral, but a living structure capable of being more living or less
living, or more sustainable or less sustainable. Under the new view of space,
geography or architecture will become part of complexity science, not only for
understanding complexity, but also for making and remaking complex or living
structures. Keywords: Scaling law, head/tail breaks, living structure, beauty,
