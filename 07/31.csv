does not alter the IMT temperature much and retains the insulating monoclinic,

significantly reduces the IR switching temperature but is detrimental to the
solar modulation ability, contrary to the Tb doping effects where higher IR
switching temperature and solar modulation ability is observed. The IMT

demonstrated that when these traditional wall boundary conditions are used, the

they do not properly enforce the no-slip condition at a smooth surface. This is
true for all dissipation-based turbulence models, including the k-{\epsilon},
k-{\omega}, and k-{\zeta} models. Physically correct wall boundary conditions
must force both k and its gradient to zero at a smooth wall. Enforcing these
two boundary conditions on k is sufficient to determine a unique solution to
the coupled system of differential transport equations. There is no need to
impose any wall boundary condition on {\epsilon}, {\omega}, or {\zeta} at a

psychophysically-tuned cascade of Wilson-Cowan and Divisive Normalization

Wilson-Cowan networks in terms of multivariate total correlation. The
parameters of the cortical model have been derived through the relation between
the steady state of the Wilson-Cowan model and the Divisive Normalization
model.
  The communication efficiency has been analyzed in two ways: First, we provide
an analytical expression for the reduction of the total correlation among the
responses of a V1-like population after the application of the Wilson-Cowan
interaction. Second, we empirically study the efficiency with visual stimuli
and statistical tools that were not available before: (1) we use a recent,
radiometrically calibrated, set of natural scenes, and (2) we use a recent
technique to estimate the multivariate total correlation in bits from sets of
visual responses which only involves univariate operations, thus giving better
estimates of the redundancy.
  The theoretical and the empirical results show that although this cascade of
layers was not optimized for statistical independence in any way, the
redundancy between the responses gets substantially reduced along the neural
pathway. Specifically, we show that (1)~the efficiency of a Wilson-Cowan
network is similar to its equivalent Divisive Normalization model, (2) while
initial layers (Von-Kries adaptation and Weber-like brightness) contribute to
univariate equalization, the bigger contributions to the reduction in total
correlation come from the computation of nonlinear local contrast and the
application of local oriented filters, and (3)~psychophysically-tuned models
are more efficient (reduce more total correlation) in the more populated
regions of the luminance-contrast plane.

conclude that the emission region of PSR J1136+1551 is better described by the

coming years. Apart from the numerous benefits that it brings, its potential
effects on the overall traffic situation need to be studied further, especially
at bottlenecks and ramps. Assuming we can control the platoons from the
infrastructure, they can be used as controlled moving bottlenecks, actuating
control actions on the rest of the traffic, and potentially improving the
throughput of the whole system. In this paper, we use a multi-class cell
transmission model to capture the interaction between truck platoons and
background traffic, and propose a corresponding queuing model, which we use for
control design. We use platoon speeds, and the number of lanes platoons occupy
as control inputs, and design a control strategy for throughput improvement of
a highway section with a bottleneck. By postponing and shaping the inflow to
the bottleneck, we are able to avoid traffic breakdown and capacity drop, which
significantly reduces the total time spent of all vehicles. We derived the
estimated improvement in throughput that is achieved by applying the proposed
control law, and then tested it in a simulation study and found that the median
delay of all vehicles by 75.6% compared to the uncontrolled case. Notably,
although they are slowed down while actuating control actions, platooned
vehicles experience less delay compared to the case without control, since they
avoid going through congestion at the bottleneck.

distribution of demand-net-of-wind for capacity adequacy assessment. Extreme
value theory approaches are well-established and mathematically justified
methods for estimating the tails of a distribution and so are ideally suited
for problems in capacity adequacy, where normally only the tails of the
relevant distributions are significant. The extreme value theory peaks over
threshold approach is applied directly to observations of demand-net-of-wind,
meaning that no assumption is needed about the nature of any dependence between
demand and wind.
  The methodology is tested on data from Great Britain and compared to two
alternative approaches: use of the empirical distribution of demand-net-of-wind
and use of a model which assumes independence between demand and wind. Extreme
value theory is shown to produce broadly similar estimates of risk metrics to
the use of the above empirical distribution but with smaller sampling
uncertainty. Estimates of risk metrics differ when the approach assuming
independence is used, especially when data across different historical years
are pooled, suggesting that assuming independence might result in the over- or
under-estimation of risk metrics.

explicitly capture the compositional nature of visual scenes. Two recent
exceptions, MONet and IODINE, decompose scenes into objects in an unsupervised

component interactions. Hence, neither of them allows for principled sampling
of novel scenes. Here we present GENESIS, the first object-centric generative
model of 3D visual scenes capable of both decomposing and generating scenes by
capturing relationships between scene components. GENESIS parameterises a
spatial GMM over images which is decoded from a set of object-centric latent
variables that are either inferred sequentially in an amortised fashion or
sampled from an autoregressive prior. We train GENESIS on several publicly
available datasets and evaluate its performance on scene generation,

search, retrieval and captioning. Unfortunately, these tasks are still
challenging since the appearance of samples of the same class can be more
different than those from different classes. Attention has been typically
implemented in neural networks by selecting the most informative regions of the
image that improve classification. In contrast, in this paper, attention is not
applied at the image level but to the convolutional feature activations. In
essence, with our approach, the neural model learns to attend to lower-level
feature activations without requiring part annotations and uses those
activations to update and rectify the output likelihood distribution. The
proposed mechanism is modular, architecture-independent and efficient in terms
of both parameters and computation required. Experiments demonstrate that
well-known networks such as Wide Residual Networks and ResNeXt, when augmented
with our approach, systematically improve their classification accuracy and
become more robust to changes in deformation and pose and to the presence of
clutter. As a result, our proposal reaches state-of-the-art classification
accuracies in CIFAR-10, the Adience gender recognition task, Stanford Dogs, and
UEC-Food100 while obtaining competitive performance in ImageNet, CIFAR-100,
CUB200 Birds, and Stanford Cars. In addition, we analyze the different
components of our model, showing that the proposed attention modules succeed in
finding the most discriminative regions of the image. Finally, as a proof of
concept, we demonstrate that with only local predictions, an augmented neural
network can successfully classify an image before reaching any fully connected
layer, thus reducing the computational amount up to 10%.

blazars with exceptional spectral properties. In blazars, the spectral energy
distribution (SED) is dominated by the non-thermal emission of the relativistic
jet, and consists of two main broad humps. For the EHBLs, these two components
peak in the X-ray and GeV-TeV bands, respectively. Although the number of TeV
detected extreme blazars is very limited, recent observations by Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) have revealed that in some of them the
energy of the second peak exceeds several TeV (e.g. 1ES 0229+200). Their
exceptional hard TeV spectra represent a challenge for the standard leptonic
modeling, and a possible hadronic contribution may make these objects
high-energy neutrinos producers. Moreover, they are important for the
implications on the indirect measurements of the extragalactic background light
and of the intergalactic magnetic field. In this contribution, we perform a
comparative study of the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of a
sample of hard X-ray selected EHBL objects. The analysis suggests that the EHBL
class is not homogeneous, and a possible sub-classification may be unveiled
with TeV gamma-ray observations of the candidates. With the purpose of
increasing their number and settle their statistics, we discuss the potential
detectability of the currently undetected TeV-emitting EHBLs in our sample by
current and next generation of IACTs.

Chen (2011). In the ESR approach, the solver keeps redundant information from
previous search directions, so that the solver state can be fully reconstructed

  In this paper, we improve the fault tolerance of the PCG algorithm based on
the ESR approach. In particular, we support recovery from simultaneous or

refine the strategy for how to store redundant information across nodes. We
analyze and implement our new method and perform numerical experiments with
large sparse matrices from real-world applications on 128 nodes of the Vienna

disseminate large volumes of data in beyond-5G networks. Unfortunately, the
directionality of mmWave communication significantly complicates efficient data
dissemination, particularly in multicasting, which is gaining more and more
importance in emerging applications (e.g., V2X, public safety). While
multicasting for systems operating at lower frequencies (i.e., sub-6GHz) has
been extensively studied, they are sub-optimal for mmWave systems as mmWave has
significantly different propagation characteristics, i.e., using the
directional transmission to compensate for the high path loss and thus
promoting spectrum sharing. In this paper, we propose novel multicast
scheduling algorithms by jointly exploiting relaying and spatial sharing gains
while aiming to minimize the multicast completion time. We first characterize
the min-time mmWave multicasting problem with a comprehensive model and
formulate it with an integer linear program (ILP). We further design a
practical and scalable distributed algorithm named mmDiMu, based on gradually
maximizing the transmission throughput over time. Finally, we carry out
validation through extensive simulations in different scales and the results
show that mmDiMu significantly outperforms conventional algorithms with around
95% reduction on multicast completion time.

  C-planarity was introduced in 1995 by Feng, Cohen, and Eades as a variant of
graph planarity, in which the vertex set of the input graph is endowed with a
hierarchical clustering and we seek an embedding (crossing free drawing) of the
graph in the plane that respects the clustering in a certain natural sense.
Until now, it has been an open problem whether c-planarity can be tested
efficiently, despite relentless efforts. The thickenability problem for
simplicial complexes emerged in the topology of manifolds in the 1960s. A
2-dimensional simplicial complex is thickenable if it embeds in some orientable
3-dimensional manifold. Recently, Carmesin announced that thickenability can be
tested in polynomial time.
  Our algorithm for atomic embeddability combines ideas from Carmesin's work
with algorithmic tools previously developed for weak embeddability testing. We
express our results purely in terms of graphs on surfaces, and rely on the
machinery of topological graph theory.
  Finally, we give a polynomial-time reduction from atomic embeddability to
thickenability thereby showing that both problems are polynomially equivalent,
and show that a slight generalization of atomic embeddability to the setting in
which clusters are toroidal graphs is NP-complete.

and because large and swinging maneuvers may be avoided for close
reconfiguration if a system is STLC. Despite the fact that controllability of
underactuated horizontal planar manipulators has been extensively studied, most
work focused only on three-link and global controllability. This paper thus has
two contributions: 1) using Lie brackets to study the accessibility and STLC
for underactuated two-link manipulators with different actuator configurations,
and illustrating the results from a perspective of system dynamics, 2)
obtaining the accessibility and STLC results for $N$-link manipulators with one
unactuated joint by considering realistic models and different actuator
configurations. It is found that an $N$-link ($N\geq 3$) with the first joint
actuated is STLC for a subset of equilibrium points based on Sussmann's general
theorem for STLC. Moreover, with the dynamics of $N$-link considered in the
controllability analysis, it gives relatively simple forms for the nontrivial

undergoing transformations on a scale and pace never observed before. The
decentralization of energy resources and the smart grid have forced utility
services to rethink their relationships with customers. Demand response (DR)
seeks to adjust the demand for power instead of adjusting the supply. However,
DR business models rely on customer participation and can only be effective
when large numbers of customers in close geographic vicinity, e.g., connected
to the same transformer, opt in. Here, we introduce a model for the dynamics of
service adoption on a two-layer multiplex network: the layer of social
interactions among customers and the power-grid layer connecting the
households. While the adoption process - based on peer-to-peer communication -
runs on the social layer, the time-dependent recovery rate of the nodes depends
on the states of their neighbors on the power-grid layer, making an infected
node surrounded by infectious ones less keen to recover. Numerical simulations
of the model on synthetic and real-world networks show that a strong local
influence of the customers' actions leads to a discontinuous transition where
either none or all the nodes in the network are infected, depending on the
infection rate and social pressure to adopt. We find that clusters of early
adopters act as points of high local pressure, helping maintaining adopters,
and facilitating the eventual adoption of all nodes. This suggests direct
marketing strategies on how to efficiently establish and maintain new
technologies such as DR schemes.

the measurement vector subject to arbitrary corruption by an adversarial agent.
This problem is relevant to cyber-physical systems where, due to the tight
coupling of physics, communication and computation, a malicious agent is able
to exploit multiple inherent vulnerabilities in order to inject stealthy
signals into the measurement process. These malicious signals are calculated to
serve the attack objectives of causing false situation awareness and/or
triggering a sequence of cascading effects leading to an ultimate system
failure. We assume that the attacker can only compromise a portion, but not
all, of the measurement channels simultaneously. However, once a channel is
compromised, the attacker is free to modify the corresponding measurement
arbitrarily.
  Consequently, the problem is formulated as a compressive sensing problem with
additional prior-information model. The prior-information considered is a set
inclusion constraint on the measurement vector. It is shown that if the prior
set satisfies certain conditions, the resulting recovery error bound is much
stronger. The approach is applied to the problem of resilient sate estimation
of a power system. For this application, Gaussian Process is used to build a
prior generative probabilistic regression model from historical data. The
resulting Gaussian Process Regression model recursively maps energy market
information to \emph{iid} Gaussian distributions on the relevant system
measurements. An optimization-based resilient state estimator is then developed
using a re-weighted $\ell_1$-minimization scheme. The developed algorithm is
evaluated through a numerical simulation example of the IEEE 14-bus system

non-linearities become important. Since the number of modes accessible on
intermediate to small scales is very high, having a precise model at these
scales is important especially in the context of discriminating alternative
cosmological models from the standard one. In the mildly non-linear regime,
such models typically differ from each other, and galaxy clustering data will
become very precise on these scales in the near future. As the observable
quantity is the angular power spectrum in redshift space, it is important to
study the effects of non-linear density and redshift space distortion (RSD) in
the angular power spectrum. We compute non-linear contributions to the angular
power spectrum using a flat-sky approximation that we introduce in this work,
and compare the results of different perturbative approaches with $N$-body
simulations. We find that the TNS perturbative approach is significantly closer
to the $N$-body result than Eulerian or Lagrangian 1-loop approximations,
effective field theory of large scale structure or a halofit-inspired model.
However, none of these prescriptions is accurate enough to model the angular
power spectrum well into the non-linear regime. In addition, for narrow
redshift bins, $\Delta z \lesssim 0.01$, the angular power spectrum acquires
non-linear contributions on all scales, right down to $\ell=2$, and is hence
not a reliable tool at this time. To overcome this problem, we need to model
non-linear RSD terms, for example as TNS does, but for a matter power spectrum
that remains reasonably accurate well into the deeply non-linear regime, such
as halofit.

  Storage",,,,,"cs.IT cs.DC cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale distributed storage systems typically use erasure codes to
provide durability of data in the face of failures. A set of $k$ blocks to be
stored is encoded using an $[n, k]$ code to generate $n$ blocks that are then
stored on different storage nodes. The redundancy configuration is chosen based
on the failure rates of storage devices, and is typically kept constant.
However, a recent work by Kadekodi et al. shows that the failure rate of
storage devices vary significantly over time, and that adapting the redundancy
configuration in response to such variations provides significant benefits.
Converting the redundancy configuration of already encoded data by re-encoding
requires significant overhead on resources such as accesses, device IO, network
bandwidth, and compute cycles.
  In this work, we first present a framework to formalize the notion of code
conversion: the process of converting data encoded with an $[n^I, k^I]$ code
into data encoded with an $[n^F, k^F]$ code while maintaining desired
decodability properties, such as the maximum-distance-separable (MDS) property.
We then introduce convertible codes, a new class of codes that allow for code
conversions in a resource-efficient manner. For an important parameter regime
(which we call the merge regime) along with the linearity and MDS decodability
constraint, we prove tight bounds on the number of nodes accessed during code
conversion. In particular, our achievability result is an explicit construction
of MDS convertible codes that are optimal for all parameter values in the merge
regime albeit with a high field size. We then present explicit low-field-size
constructions of optimal MDS convertible codes for a broad range of parameters
in the merge regime. Our results thus show that it is indeed possible to
achieve code conversions with significantly lesser resources as compared to
re-encoding.

captures and (n,p) reactions, where the free neutrons are created in situ by
$\overline{\nu}_\mathrm{e}+\mathrm{p} \rightarrow \mathrm{n}+\mathrm{e}^+$
reactions. The detailed hydrodynamic evolution determines where the
nucleosynthesis path turns off from N = Z line and how far up the nuclear chart
it runs. In this work, the uncertainties on the final isotopic abundances
stemming from uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates were investigated in
a large-scale Monte Carlo approach, simultaneously varying ten thousand
reactions. A large range of model conditions was investigated because a
definitive astrophysical site for the $\nu$p process has not yet been
identified. The present parameter study provides, for each model,
identification of the key nuclear reactions dominating the uncertainty for a
given nuclide abundance. As all rates appearing in the $\nu$p process involve
unstable nuclei, and thus only theoretical rates are available, the final
abundance uncertainties are larger than those for nucleosynthesis processes
closer to stability. Nevertheless, most uncertainties remain below a factor of
three in trajectories with robust nucleosynthesis. More extreme conditions
allow production of heavier nuclides but show larger uncertainties because of
the accumulation of the uncertainties in many rates and because the termination
of nucleosynthesis is not at equilibrium conditions. It is also found that the
solar ratio of the abundances of ${}^{92}$Mo and ${}^{94}$Mo could be

(e.g., the drop in star-formation density at z>8). We generate an ionizing
spectrum for each galaxy in our model and constrain $f_{esc}$ using latest
measurements of the reionization timeline (e.g., Ly$\alpha$ damping of quasars
and galaxies at z>7). Assuming a constant $f_{esc}$, we find $M_{UV}$<-13.5
galaxies need $f_{esc}=0.21^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ to complete reionization. The
inferred IGM neutral fraction is [0.9, 0.5, 0.1] at z=[8.2, 6.8, 6.2]$\pm$0.2,
i.e., the bulk of reionization transpires in 300 Myrs. Inspired by the emergent
sample of Lyman Continuum (LyC) leakers that overwhelmingly displays
higher-than-average star-formation surface density ($\Sigma$), we propose a
model relating $f_{esc}$ to $\Sigma$ and find
$f_{esc}\propto\Sigma^{0.4\pm0.1}$. Since $\Sigma$ falls by ~2.5 dex between
z=8 and z=0, our model explains the humble upper limits on $f_{esc}$ at lower
redshifts and its required evolution to ~0.2 at z>6. Within this model,
strikingly, <5% of galaxies with $M_{UV}$<-18 (the `oligarchs') account for
>80% of the reionization budget. In fact, faint sources ($M_{UV}$>-16) must be
relegated to a limited role to ensure high neutral fractions at z=7-8. Shallow
faint-end slopes of the UV luminosity function ($\alpha$>-2) and/or $f_{esc}$
distributions skewed toward bright galaxies produce the required late and rapid
reionization. We predict LyC leakers like COLA1 (z=6.6, $f_{esc}$~30%,
$M_{UV}$=-21.5) become increasingly common towards z~6 and that the drivers of
reionization do not lie hidden across the faint-end of the luminosity function,

range of dark matter substructure properties. The time-dependent tidal force is
determined based on the combined tidal tensor of the galaxy's smooth and clumpy
dark matter components, the latter of which causes fluctuations in the tidal
field that can heat clusters. The strength and duration of these fluctuations
are sensitive to the local dark matter density, substructure fraction, sub-halo
mass function, and the sub-halo mass-size relation. Based on the cold dark
matter framework, we initially assume sub-halos are Hernquist spheres following
a power-law mass function between $10^5$ and $10^{11} {\rm M}_\odot$ and find
that tidal fluctuations are too weak and too short to affect star cluster
evolution. Treating sub-halos as point masses, to explore how denser sub-halos
affect clusters, we find that only sub-halos with masses greater than $10^{6}
{\rm M}_\odot$ will cause cluster dissolution times to decrease. These
interactions can also decrease the size of a cluster while increasing the
velocity dispersion and tangential anisotropy in the outer regions via tidal
heating. Hence increased fluctuations in the tidal tensor, especially
fluctuations that are due to low-mass halos, do not necessarily translate into
mass loss. We further conclude that the tidal approximation can be used to
model cluster evolution in the tidal fields of cosmological simulations with a
minimum cold dark matter sub-halo mass of $10^{6} {\rm M}_\odot$, as the effect
of lower-mass sub-halos on star clusters is negligible.

survive as subhalos within larger galactic halos, but due to their small size,

of a microhalo's density profile due to stellar encounters. We find that there
is a universal density profile for microhalos subjected to stellar encounters,
and each encounter alters a microhalo's scale parameters in a way that is

colliding sheets of energy density moving at the speed of light and tracking
the subsequent evolution. In this work, we consider the dual gravitational
description of such collisions in the most general bulk theory with a

of such collisions in a gauge theory with finite gauge coupling, working
perturbatively in the inverse coupling. While the dynamics of energy and

analyzed previously, here we are able to determine the effect of such finite
coupling corrections on the dynamics of the density of a conserved global
charge, which we take as a model for the dynamics of nonzero baryon number

that after the collisions less baryon density ends up stopped at mid-rapidity

comprehensively measuring the emission spectra of rocky exoplanets orbiting M
dwarfs to detect and characterize their atmospheres. In preparation for this
opportunity, we present model atmospheres for three M-dwarf planets
particularly amenable to secondary eclipse spectroscopy -- TRAPPIST-1b, GJ
1132b, and LHS 3844b. Using three limiting cases of candidate atmospheric
compositions (pure H2O, pure CO2 and solar abundances) we calculate
temperature-pressure profiles and emission and reflection spectra in
radiative-convective equilibrium, including the effects of a solid surface. We
find that the atmospheric radiative transfer is significantly influenced by the
cool M-star irradiation; H2O and CO2 absorption bands in the near-infrared are
strong enough to absorb a sizeable fraction of the incoming stellar light at
low pressures, which leads to temperature inversions in the upper atmosphere.
The non-gray band structure of gaseous opacities in the infrared is hereby an
important factor. Opacity windows are muted at higher atmospheric temperatures,
so we expect temperature inversions to be common only for sufficiently cool
planets. We also find that pure CO2 atmospheres exhibit lower overall
temperatures and stronger reflection spectra compared to models of the other
two compositions. We estimate that for GJ 1132b and LHS 3844b we should be able
to distinguish between different atmospheric compositions with JWST. The
emission lines from the predicted temperature inversions are currently hard to
measure, but high resolution spectroscopy with future Extremely Large
Telescopes may be able to detect them.

be further validated via follow-up spectroscopy or phase curves. In addition,
because this technique is fast it could enable a first atmospheric survey of

planets that are too hot to be habitable but that can be quickly probed via

compares favorably against idealized general circulation model simulations of

generally becomes efficient, and a planet's observable thermal phase curve and
secondary eclipse start to deviate significantly from that of a bare rock, once

scenarios for which heat transport can be notably more or less efficient, such
as H2 and CO atmospheres or hot lava ocean worlds. The results thus bridge the

therefore we propose analyses to test these channels at the LHCb. We
demonstrate that the reach of this facility extends to branching ratios as
small as $6.0\times 10^{-9}$, $1.6\times 10^{-9}$, $5.9\times 10^{-9}$ and
$1.8\times 10^{-8}$ for the aforementioned channels, respectively. For
$m_{1,2}\gg \mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV, we show that slightly modified versions of
current multilepton and multitau searches at the LHC can probe wide regions of
the parameter space of this scenario. Altogether, the potential of the searches
we propose outperform other constraints such as those from meson mixing.

seven per cent, and an average white dwarf mass of $\langle M_\mathrm{WD}

results, ruling out the presence of observational biases affecting these

period bounce CVs falls well below theoretical predictions, by at least a
factor of five, and remains one of the open problems in the current
understanding of CV evolution. Conversely, the average white dwarf mass
supports the presence of additional mechanisms of angular momentum loss that
have been accounted for in the latest evolutionary models. The fraction of
magnetic CVs in the $150\,$pc sample is remarkably high at $36\,$per cent. This
is in striking contrast with the absence of magnetic white dwarfs in the

modern pressure-energy smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method including
isotropic thermal conduction and a meshless-finite-mass (MFM) solver. We find
stronger resolution requirements for chemistry and hot phase generation than
for momentum generation. While at $10$ M$_{\odot}$ the radial momenta at the
end of the Sedov phase start converging, the hot phase generation and chemistry
require higher resolutions to represent the neutral to ionised hydrogen

reduces the hot phase by $0.2$ dex and has little impact on the chemical
composition. In general, our $1$, and $0.1$ M$_{\odot}$ results agree well with
previous numerical and analytic estimates. We conclude that for the thermal

However, quantifying entanglement in these systems of large size in the

different prescriptions to characterize noisy stabilizer states, including the
surface and the color codes, in terms of localizable entanglement over a subset
of qubits. In one approach, we exploit appropriately constructed entanglement
witness operators to estimate a witness-based lower bound of localizable
entanglement, which is directly accessible in experiments. In the other recipe,
we use graph states that are local unitary equivalent to the stabilizer state
to determine a computable measurement-based lower bound of localizable
entanglement. If used experimentally, this translates to a lower bound of
localizable entanglement obtained from single-qubit measurements in specific
bases to be performed on the qubits outside the subsystem of interest. Towards
computing these lower bounds, we discuss in detail the methodology of obtaining
a local unitary equivalent graph state from a stabilizer state, which includes
a new and scalable geometric recipe as well as an algebraic method that applies
to general stabilizer states of arbitrary size. Moreover, as a crucial step of
the latter recipe, we develop a scalable graph-transformation algorithm that
creates a link between two specific nodes in a graph using a sequence of local
complementation operations. We develop open-source Python packages for these
transformations, and illustrate the methodology by applying it to a noisy
topological color code, and study how the witness and measurement-based lower
bounds of localizable entanglement varies with the distance between the chosen

loss defects and separated by an ultrathin air gap. The nonlinear response of
this scalable configuration is triggered at relatively low optical intensities

system, result in a pronounced self-induced nonreciprocal transmission. Cascade
configurations with optimized geometrical dimensions are used to achieve
self-induced nonreciprocal transmission with a maximum contrast, ideal for the
design of new all-optical diodes. The presented robust nonreciprocal response
occurs by operating at a frequency slightly shifted off the exceptional point
but without breaking the PT-symmetric phase, different compared to previous
works. The findings of this work can have a plethora of applications, such as
nonreciprocal ultrathin coatings for the protection of sources or other

$\gamma\gamma H$, $\gamma ZH$, $ZZH$, and $W^{+}W^{-}H$ production at the LHC
(14 TeV), HE-LHC (27 TeV), and FCC-hh (100 TeV) colliders. Our main focus is to
estimate the gluon-gluon ($gg$) channel ($gg \to VV^\prime H$) contributions to
$pp \to VV^\prime H~(V,V^\prime=\gamma,Z,W)$ and compare them with
corresponding contributions arising from the quark-quark ($qq$) channel.
Technically, the leading order $gg$ channel contribution to $pp \to VV^\prime
H$ cross section is an NNLO correction in $\alpha_s$. In the processes under
consideration, we find that in the $gg$ channel, $W^{+}W^{-}H$ has the largest
cross section. However, relative contribution of the $gg$ channel is more
important for the $pp \to ZZH$ production. At the FCC-hh, $gg \to ZZH$
contribution is comparable with the NLO QCD correction to $qq \to ZZH$. We also
compute the cross sections when $W$ and $Z$-bosons are polarized. In the
production of $W^{+}W^{-}H$ and $ZZH$, we find that the $gg$ channel
contributes more significantly when the vector bosons are longitudinally
polarized. By examining such events, one can increase the fraction of the $gg$
channel contribution to these processes. Further, we have studied
beyond-the-standard-model effects in the $\kappa$-framework. We find that the
$gg$ channel processes $ZZH$ and $WWH$ have very mild dependence on
$\kappa_\lambda$, but strong dependence on $\kappa_t$ and $\kappa_V$. The $qq$
channel processes mainly depend on $\kappa_V$. Dependence of the $gg$ channel
contribution on $\kappa_V$ is stronger than that of the $qq$ channel
contribution. Therefore focusing on events with longitudinally polarized $W$
and $Z$-bosons, one can find stronger dependence on $\kappa_V$ that can help us
measure this parameter.

with tens to hundreds of bars of H2, which persist for 100 Myrs or longer.
Although the earliest habitable conditions on Earth and terrestrial exoplanets
could thus arise while the atmosphere is still dominated by H2, the climatic
effects of H2 remain poorly understood. Previous work showed that H2 induces
strong greenhouse warming at the outer edge of the habitable zone. Here we use
a 1D radiative-convective model to show that H2 also leads to strong warming
near the inner edge of the habitable zone. Unlike H2's greenhouse warming at
the outer edge, however, its effect near the inner edge is driven by
thermodynamics: H2's large thermal scale height allows the atmosphere to store
more water vapor than either a pure-H2O atmosphere or an atmosphere with a
heavy background gas, such as N2 or CO2, thereby amplifying the greenhouse
effect of H2O. Using idealized grey calculations, we then present a general
argument for how different background gases affect the inner edge of the
habitable zone. H2 stands out for its ability to induce novel ""Souffle""
climates, which further support its warming effect. Our results show that if
the earliest conditions on a planet near the inner edge of the habitable zone
were H2-rich, they were likely also hot: 1 bar of H2 is sufficient to raise
surface temperatures above 340 K, and 50 bar of H2 are sufficient to raise
surface temperatures above 450 K.

as their thermal oxides contain several metal oxidation states, whereas
controls using Al or Cr nanolayers, which self-terminate with oxides that are
redox inactive under the experimental conditions, exhibit dramatically
diminished performance. The nanolayers are shown to generate electrical current
in various modes of application with moving liquids, including sliding liquid
droplets, salinity gradients in a flowing liquid, and in the oscillatory motion
of a liquid without a salinity gradient.

possible, so that bias is mitigated. However, for a number of reasons
(logistical, practical, financial, etc.), committees can also not be infinitely
large and thus trade-offs must be made. It is often recognized that conflicts
of interest must be acknowledged within these committees, but what is not often
recognized it the potential for unmitigated biases and ""group think"" that can
be introduced as part of these committees.
  In this white paper, we recommend that advisory committees that collect
community input, (e.g., the Decadal Survey review committee), also collect,
compile and review input demographic data before finalizing reports, (e.g., the
final 2020 Decadal Survey Report). A summary of these data should be released
alongside the final survey report. This information would enable the committee
to understand potential ""blind spots"" and biases of the data collection phase

automatic sleep staging methods, building a good model still remains a big
challenge for sleep studies with a small cohort due to the data-variability and
data-inefficiency issues. This work presents a deep transfer learning approach
to overcome these issues and enable transferring knowledge from a large dataset
to a small cohort for automatic sleep staging. Methods: We start from a generic
end-to-end deep learning framework for sequence-to-sequence sleep staging and
derive two networks as the means for transfer learning. The networks are first
trained in the source domain (i.e. the large database). The pretrained networks
are then finetuned in the target domain (i.e. the small cohort) to complete
knowledge transfer. We employ the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS)
database consisting of 200 subjects as the source domain and study deep
transfer learning on three different target domains: the Sleep Cassette subset
and the Sleep Telemetry subset of the Sleep-EDF Expanded database, and the
Surrey-cEEGrid database. The target domains are purposely adopted to cover
different degrees of data mismatch to the source domains. Results: Our
experimental results show significant performance improvement on automatic
sleep staging on the target domains achieved with the proposed deep transfer
learning approach. Conclusions: These results suggest the efficacy of the
proposed approach in addressing the above-mentioned data-variability and
data-inefficiency issues. Significance: As a consequence, it would enable one
to improve the quality of automatic sleep staging models when the amount of
data is relatively small. The source code and the pretrained models are

mappings; (ii) expanding the visual vocabulary used in scientific
visualizations to depict increasingly complex multivariate data; (iii) bringing
a more engaging, natural, and human-relatable handcrafted aesthetic to data

applets for constructing artifact-based colormaps, optimizing 3D scanned meshes
for use in data visualization, and synthesizing textures from artifacts. These
are complemented by an interactive rendering engine with custom algorithms and
interfaces that demonstrate multiple new visual styles for depicting point,
line, surface, and volume data. A within-the-research-team design study
provides early evidence of the shift in visualization design processes that ABR
is believed to enable when compared to traditional scientific visualization
systems. Qualitative user feedback on applications to climate science and brain

substantial human judgment on the automated analysis results is required for
anomaly interpretation. In this paper, we present a unified visual analytics
system named CloudDet to interactively detect, inspect, and diagnose anomalies
in cloud computing systems. A novel unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm is
developed to identify anomalies based on the specific temporal patterns of the

visualized in our system to indicate the occurrences of anomalies. Rich
visualization and interaction designs are used to help understand the anomalies
in the spatial and temporal context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of

in acoustic recordings is expanding internationally due to the necessity to
analyze large collections of data for conservation purposes. In this work, we
present a Convolutional Neural Network that is capable of classifying the
vocalizations of three species of whales, non-biological sources of noise, and
a fifth class pertaining to ambient noise. In this way, the classifier is
capable of detecting the presence and absence of whale vocalizations in an
acoustic recording. Through transfer learning, we show that the classifier is
capable of learning high-level representations and can generalize to additional
species. We also propose a novel representation of acoustic signals that builds
upon the commonly used spectrogram representation by way of interpolating and
stacking multiple spectrograms produced using different Short-time Fourier
Transform (STFT) parameters. The proposed representation is particularly
effective for the task of marine mammal species classification where the
acoustic events we are attempting to classify are sensitive to the parameters
of the STFT.

of a network is affected as some of its constituent parts fail. Failures can
occur at random or be part of an intentional attack and, in general, networks
behave differently against different removal strategies. Although much effort
has been put on this topic, there is no unified framework to study the problem.
While random failures have been mostly studied under percolation theory,
targeted attacks have been recently restated in terms of network dismantling.
In this work, we link these two approaches by performing a finite-size scaling
analysis to four dismantling strategies over Erd\""{o}s-R\'enyi networks:
initial and recalculated high degree removal and initial and recalculated high
betweenness removal. We find that the critical exponents associated with the
initial attacks are consistent with the ones corresponding to random
percolation, while the recalculated attacks are likely to belong to different
universality classes. In particular, recalculated betweenness produces a very
abrupt transition with a hump in the cluster size distribution near the
critical point, resembling some explosive percolation processes.

their presence thermodynamically by a positive sign for $R$, with a negative

large-scale structure analyses combining photometric cosmic shear and galaxy
clustering data (i.e. the now commonly called ""3$\times$2-point"" analysis).
Using a Fisher matrix bias formalism, we disentangle the contribution to the
bias on cosmological parameters caused by ignoring the effects of magnification
in a theory fit from individual elements in the data vector, for Stage-III and
Stage-IV surveys, assuming well-known redshift distributions, sample selection
based on magnitude, and magnification strengths inferred from CFHTLenS and DES
Y1 data. We show that the removal of elements of the data vectors that are
dominated by magnification does not guarantee a reduction in the cosmological
bias due to the magnification signal, but can instead increase the sensitivity
to magnification. We find that the most sensitive elements of the data vector
come from the shear-clustering cross-correlations, particularly between the
highest-redshift shear bin and any lower-redshift lens sample, and that the
parameters $\Omega_{M}$, $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_M/0.3}$ and $w_0$ show the
most significant biases for both survey models. Our forecasts predict that
current analyses are not significantly biased by magnification, but this bias
will become highly significant with the continued increase of statistical power
in the near future. We therefore conclude that future surveys should measure

Existing work focus primarily on either distributed computing platforms, data
query tools, or, algorithms to divide big data and conquer at individual
machines etc. It is, however, increasingly often that the data of interest are
inherently distributed, i.e., data are stored at multiple distributed sites due
to diverse collection channels, business operations etc. We propose to enable
learning and inference in such a setting via a general framework based on the
distortion minimizing local transformations. This framework only requires a
small amount of local signatures to be shared among distributed sites,
eliminating the need of having to transmitting big data. Computation can be
done very efficiently via parallel local computation. The error incurred due to
distributed computing vanishes when increasing the size of local signatures. As
the shared data need not be in their original form, data privacy may also be
preserved. Experiments on linear (logistic) regression and Random Forests have
shown promise of this approach. This framework is expected to apply to a
general class of tools in learning and inference with the continuity property.

used to investigate Lorentz violation at the level of effective field theory.
It has been used to obtain stringent experimental bounds on Lorentz violation
in a wide range of tests. In the gravity sector of the SME, it is typically
assumed that the spacetime symmetry breaking occurs spontaneously in order to
avoid potential conflicts with the Bianchi identities. A post-Newtonian limit
as well as matter-gravity couplings in the SME have been developed and
investigated based on this assumption. In this paper, the possibility of using
the SME to also describe gravity theories with explicit spacetime symmetry
breaking is investigated. It is found that in a wide range of cases,
particularly when matter-gravity couplings are included, consistency with the
Bianchi identities can be maintained, and therefore the SME can be used to
search for signals of the symmetry breaking. Two examples with explicit
breaking are considered. The first is ghost-free massive gravity with an
effective metric that couples to matter. The second is Horava gravity coupled
with matter in an infrared limit.

In this paper, we show that the evolution equations for open thermodynamic
systems, i.e., systems exchanging heat and matter with the exterior, admit an
intrinsic formulation in terms of Dirac structures. We focus on simple systems,
in which the thermodynamic state is described by a single entropy variable. A
main difficulty compared to the case of closed systems lies in the explicit
time dependence of the constraint associated to the entropy production. We
overcome this issue by working with the geometric setting of time-dependent
nonholonomic mechanics. We define three type of Dirac dynamical systems for the
nonequilibrium thermodynamics of open systems, based either on the generalized
energy, the Lagrangian, or the Hamiltonian. The variational formulations
associated to the Dirac systems formulations are also presented.

information in the relative timing of individual neuron spikes. In
classification tasks, the output of the network is indicated by the first
neuron to spike in the output layer. This temporal coding scheme allows the
supervised training of the network with backpropagation, using locally exact
derivatives of the postsynaptic spike times with respect to presynaptic spike
times. The network operates using a biologically-plausible alpha synaptic
transfer function. Additionally, we use trainable synchronisation pulses that
provide bias, add flexibility during training and exploit the decay part of the
alpha function. We show that such networks can be trained successfully on noisy
Boolean logic tasks and on the MNIST dataset encoded in time. The results show
that the spiking neural network outperforms comparable spiking models on MNIST
and achieves similar quality to fully connected conventional networks with the
same architecture. We also find that the spiking network spontaneously
discovers two operating regimes, mirroring the accuracy-speed trade-off
observed in human decision-making: a slow regime, where a decision is taken
after all hidden neurons have spiked and the accuracy is very high, and a fast
regime, where a decision is taken very fast but the accuracy is lower. These
results demonstrate the computational power of spiking networks with biological
characteristics that encode information in the timing of individual neurons. By
studying temporal coding in spiking networks, we aim to create building blocks

architectures.

with an intuitionistic logic corresponding to pure functional programming,
these classical connectives bring more of the pleasant symmetries of classical
logic to the computationally-relevant, constructive setting. In particular, an
involutive pair of negations bridges the gulf between the wide-spread notions

complete the study of duality in compilation, we also consider the dual to

comprised of two stages where the first stage operates only on depth to produce
rough initial masks, and the second stage refines these masks with RGB.
Surprisingly, our framework is able to learn from synthetic RGB-D data where
the RGB is non-photorealistic. To train our method, we introduce a large-scale
synthetic dataset of random objects on tabletops. We show that our method,

forthcoming continuum surveys on the next generation of large radio telescopes,
as well as mitigating the existing bias towards the most optically bright
sources. While there is a well known correlation between the near-infrared
K-band magnitude and redshift for galaxies, we find the K-z relation to break
down for samples dominated by quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). We hypothesise that
this is due to the additional contribution to the near-infrared flux by the
active galactic nucleus (AGN), and, as such, the K-band magnitude can only
provide a lower limit to the redshift in the case of active galactic nuclei,
which will dominate the radio surveys. From a large optical dataset, we find a
tight relationship between the rest-frame (U-K)/(W2-FUV) colour ratio and
spectroscopic redshift over a sample of 17,000 sources, spanning z ~ 0.1 - 5.
Using the observed-frame ratios of (U K)/(W2-FUV) for redshifts of z > 1,
(I-W2)/(W3-U) for 1 < z < 3 and (I-W2.5)/(W4-R) for z > 3, where W2.5 is the
8.0 micron magnitude and the appropriate redshift ranges are estimated from the
W2 (4.5 micron) magnitude, we find this to be a robust photometric redshift
estimator for quasars. We suggest that the rest-frame U-K colour traces the
excess flux from the AGN over this wide range of redshifts, although the W2-FUV

how tight intensities of interstellar diffuse bands (DIBs)are related to the
amount of extinction, measured using E(B$-$V). We have measured equivalent
widths of the strongest DIBs (centered at $\lambda\lambda$ 5780.6, 5797.0,
6196.0, 6379.3, 6613.5, and 8620.7 A), as well as of CH (near 4300.3 A) and

were measured using a template, which was constructed using the high quality

correlate with E(B$-$V) relatively tightly (with the Pearson's correlation

Correlation Filters (GFS-DCF) based visual object tracking. The key innovation
of the proposed method is to perform group feature selection across both

multi-channel features to the filtering system. In contrast to the widely used
spatial regularisation or feature selection methods, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time that channel selection has been advocated for
DCF-based tracking. We demonstrate that our GFS-DCF method is able to
significantly improve the performance of a DCF tracker equipped with deep
neural network features. In addition, our GFS-DCF enables joint feature
selection and filter learning, achieving enhanced discrimination and
interpretability of the learned filters.
  To further improve the performance, we adaptively integrate historical
information by constraining filters to be smooth across temporal frames, using
an efficient low-rank approximation. By design, specific
temporal-spatial-channel configurations are dynamically learned in the tracking
process, highlighting the relevant features, and alleviating the performance
degrading impact of less discriminative representations and reducing
information redundancy. The experimental results obtained on OTB2013, OTB2015,

hardware-isolated execution areas in memory, called enclaves. By running only
the most trusted application components in the enclave, TEEs enable developers
to minimize the TCB of their applications thereby helping to protect sensitive
application data. However, porting existing applications to TEEs often requires
considerable refactoring efforts, as TEEs provide a restricted interface to
standard OS features. To ease development efforts, TEE application developers
often choose to run their unmodified application in a library OS container that
provides a full in-enclave OS interface. Yet, this large-TCB development
approach now leaves sensitive in-enclave data exposed to potential bugs or
vulnerabilities in third-party code imported into the application. Importantly,
because the TEE libOS and the application run in the same enclave address
space, even the libOS management data structures (e.g. file descriptor table)
may be vulnerable to attack, where in traditional OSes these data structures
may be protected via privilege isolation.
  We present EnclaveDom, a privilege separation system for large-TCB TEE
applications that partitions an enclave into tagged memory regions, and
enforces per-region access rules at the granularity of individual in-enclave
functions. EnclaveDom is implemented on Intel SGX using Memory Protection Keys
(MPK) for memory tagging. To evaluate the security and performance impact of
EnclaveDom, we integrated EnclaveDom with the Graphene-SGX library OS. While no
product or component can be absolutely secure, our prototype helps protect
internal libOS management data structures against tampering by
application-level code. At every libOS system call, EnclaveDom then only grants
access to those internal data structures which the syscall needs to perform its
task.

We investigate the origin of the velocity bias in the peaks model from the

the velocity bias in the peaks model is a consequence of the ""flat constraint,""

the locations of peaks. We show that the velocity bias in the peaks model is

poorly on datasets containing low resolution images. This deters the
performance of algorithms relying on quality landmarks, for example, face
recognition. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any dataset
consisting of low resolution face images along with their annotated landmarks,
making supervised training infeasible. In this paper, we present a
semi-supervised approach to predict landmarks on low resolution images by
learning them from labeled high resolution images. The objective of this work
is to show that predicting landmarks directly on low resolution images is more
effective than the current practice of aligning images after rescaling or
superresolution. In a two-step process, the proposed approach first learns to
generate low resolution images by modeling the distribution of target low
resolution images. In the second stage, the roles of generated images and real
low resolution images are switched and the model learns to predict landmarks
for real low resolution images from generated low resolution images. With
extensive experimentation, we study the impact of each of the design choices
and also show that prediction of landmarks directly on low resolution images
improves the performance of important tasks such as face recognition in low
resolution images.

large and complex models continues to grow in importance because of the demand
for faster and more frequent training. Data parallelism (DP) is the most widely
used parallelization strategy, but as the number of devices in data parallel
training grows, so does the communication overhead between devices.
Additionally, a larger aggregate batch size per step leads to statistical
efficiency loss, i.e., a larger number of epochs are required to converge to a
desired accuracy. These factors affect overall training time and beyond a
certain number of devices, the speedup from leveraging DP begins to scale
poorly. In addition to DP, each training step can be accelerated by exploiting
model parallelism (MP). This work explores hybrid parallelization, where each
data parallel worker is comprised of more than one device, across which the
model dataflow graph (DFG) is split using MP. We show that at scale, hybrid
training will be more effective at minimizing end-to-end training time than
exploiting DP alone. We project that for Inception-V3, GNMT, and BigLSTM, the
hybrid strategy provides an end-to-end training speedup of at least 26.5%, 8%,

point towards a direction of the effect of an action. For example, policymakers
might be interested in estimating the effect of slightly increasing taxes on
private spending across the whole population. We study identifiability and
estimation of causal effects, where a continuous treatment is slightly shifted
across the whole population (termed average partial effect or incremental
causal effect). We show that incremental effects are identified under local
ignorability and local overlap assumptions, where exchangeability and
positivity only hold in a neighborhood of units. Average treatment effects are
not identified under these assumptions. In this case, and under a smoothness
condition, the incremental effect can be estimated via the average derivative.
Moreover, we prove that in certain finite-sample observational settings,
estimating the incremental effect is easier than estimating the average
treatment effect in terms of asymptotic variance. For high-dimensional
settings, we develop a simple feature transformation that allows for
doubly-robust estimation and inference of incremental causal effects. Finally,
we compare the behaviour of estimators of the incremental treatment effect and

ghost correction called Robust Autocalibrated LORAKS (RAC-LORAKS). The method
can be used to suppress EPI ghosts arising from the differences between
different readout gradient polarities and/or the differences between different
shots. It does not require conventional EPI navigator signals, and is robust to
imperfect autocalibration data.
  Methods: Autocalibrated LORAKS is a previous structured low-rank method for
EPI ghost correction that uses GRAPPA-type autocalibration data to enable
high-quality ghost correction. This method works well when the autocalibration
data is pristine, but performance degrades substantially when the
autocalibration information is imperfect. RAC-LORAKS generalizes Autocalibrated
LORAKS in two ways. First, it does not completely trust the information from
autocalibration data, and instead considers the autocalibration and EPI data
simultaneously when estimating low-rank matrix structure. And second, it uses
complementary information from the autocalibration data to improve EPI
reconstruction in a multi-contrast joint reconstruction framework. RAC-LORAKS
is evaluated using simulations and in vivo data, including comparisons to
state-of-the-art methods.
  Results: RAC-LORAKS is demonstrated to have good ghost elimination
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in several complicated EPI
acquisition scenarios (including gradient-echo brain imaging, diffusion-encoded
brain imaging, and cardiac imaging).
  Conclusion: RAC-LORAKS provides effective suppression of EPI ghosts and is
robust to imperfect autocalibration data.

resonance fingerprinting (MRF).
  Methods: Simulations and phantom experiments were performed to study the
impact of MT on the MRF signal and its potential influence on T1 and T2
estimation. Subsequently, an MRF sequence implementing off-resonance MT pulses
and a dictionary with an MT dimension by incorporating a two-pool model were
used to estimate the fractional pool size in addition to the B1+, T1, and T2
values. The proposed method was evaluated in the human brain.
  Results: Simulations and phantom experiments showed that an MRF signal
obtained from a cross-linked bovine serum sample is influenced by MT. Using a
dictionary based on an MT model, a better match between simulations and
acquired MR signals can be obtained (NRMSE 1.3% versus 4.7%). Adding
off-resonance MT pulses can improve the differentiation of MT from T1 and T2.
In-vivo results showed that MT affects the MRF signals from white matter
(fractional pool-size ~16%) and gray matter (fractional pool-size ~10%).
Furthermore, longer T1 (~1060 ms versus ~860 ms) and T2 values (~47 ms versus
~35 ms) can be observed in white matter if MT is accounted for.
  Conclusion: Our experiments demonstrated a potential influence of MT on the
quantification of T1 and T2 with MRF. A model that encompasses MT effects can
improve the accuracy of estimated relaxation parameters and allows
quantification of the fractional pool size.

applications including detecting errors in databases. While there has been
extensive prior work on methods for outlier detection, modern datasets often
have sizes that are beyond the ability of commonly used methods to process the
data within a reasonable time. To overcome this issue, outlier detection
methods can be trained over samples of the full-sized dataset. However, it is
not clear how a model trained on a sample compares with one trained on the
entire dataset. In this paper, we introduce the notion of resilience to
sampling for outlier detection methods. Orthogonal to traditional performance
metrics such as precision/recall, resilience represents the extent to which the
outliers detected by a method applied to samples from a sampling scheme matches
those when applied to the whole dataset. We propose a novel approach for
estimating the resilience to sampling of both individual outlier methods and
their ensembles. We performed an extensive experimental study on synthetic and
real-world datasets where we study seven diverse and representative outlier
detection methods, compare results obtained from samples versus those obtained
from the whole datasets and evaluate the accuracy of our resilience estimates.
We observed that the methods are not equally resilient to a given sampling
scheme and it is often the case that careful joint selection of both the
sampling scheme and the outlier detection method is necessary. It is our hope
that the paper initiates research on designing outlier detection algorithms
that are resilient to sampling.

remains a challenging task due to lack of methodology for solving the phonon

tackle this challenge by developing a multiscale numerical scheme for the
transient phonon Boltzmann equation under Callaway's dual relaxation model
which captures well the collective phonon kinetics. Comparing to traditional
numerical methods, the present multiscale scheme is efficient, accurate and
stable in all transport regimes attributed to avoiding the use of time and
spatial steps smaller than the relaxation time and mean free path of phonons.
The formation, propagation and composition of ballistic pulses and second sound
in graphene ribbon in two classical paradigms for experimental detection are
investigated via the multiscale scheme. The second sound is declared to be
mainly contributed by ZA phonon modes, whereas the ballistic pulses are mainly
contributed by LA and TA phonon modes. The influence of temperature, isotope
abundance and ribbon size on the second sound propagation is also explored. The
speed of second sound in the observation window is found to be at most 20
percentages smaller than the theoretical value in hydrodynamic limit due to the
finite umklapp, isotope and edge resistive scattering. The present study will
contribute to not only the solution methodology of phonon Boltzmann equation,
but also the physics of transient hydrodynamic phonon transport as guidance for
future experimental detection.

abstraction and translates existing policies from heterogeneous vendor-specific
programming languages such as Groovy-based SmartThings, OpenHAB, IFTTT-based
templates, and MUD-based profiles into a vendor-independent graph-based
specification. Using the two, VISCR can automatically detect rouge policies,
conflicts, and bugs for coherent automation. Upon detection, VISCR infers new
policies and proposes them to users as alternatives to existing policies for
fine-tuning and conflict-free enforcement. We evaluated VISCR using a dataset
of 907 IoT apps, programmed using heterogeneous automation specifications in a
simulated smart-building IoT infrastructure. In our experiments, among 907 IoT
apps, VISCR exposed 342 of IoT apps as exhibiting one or more violations. VISCR
detected 100% of violations reported by existing state-of-the-art tool, while
detecting new types of violations in an additional 266 apps. In terms of
performance, VISCR can generate 400 abstraction trees (used in specifying
policies) with 100K leaf nodes in <1.2sec. In our experiments, VISCR took 80.7
seconds to analyze our infrastructure of 907 apps; a 14.2X reduction compared
to the state-of-the-art. After the initial analysis, VISCR is capable of
adopting new policies in sub-second latency to handle changes.

The services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a
service and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform
agnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design
pattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart
contract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain.
The proposed solutions are evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use
case in terms of feasibility and scalability.

detect load-redistribution (LR) attacks against energy management systems
(EMSs). Prior studies have shown that certain LR attacks can bypass
conventional bad data detectors (BDDs) and remain undetectable, which implies
that presence of a reliable and intelligent detection mechanism to flag LR
attacks, is imperative. Therefore, in this study a detection mechanism to
enhance the existing BDDs is proposed based on the fundamental knowledge of the
physics laws in the electric grid. A greedy algorithm, which can optimize the
core LR attack problems, is presented to enable a fast mechanism to identify
the most sensitive locations for critical assets. The main contribution of this
detection mechanism is leveraging of power systems domain insight to identify
an underlying exploitable structure for the core problem of LR attack problems,
which enables the prediction of the attackers' behavior. Additional
contribution includes the ability to combine this approach with other detection
mechanisms to increase their likelihood of detection. The proposed approach is
applied to 2383-bus Polish test system to demonstrate the scalability of the
greedy algorithm, and it solved the attacker's problem more than 10x faster
than a traditional linear optimization approach.

choosing public work is to cooperate and choosing private work is to defect. We
then investigate the effects of employee productivity, human capital and

employee productivity of public work is low, people are more willing to enter

improve system output. On the contrary, when the employee productivity of

to determine the EoS as a function of redshift without invoking any particular
dark energy model, so that the resulting EoS can be free of model-induced
biases or artifacts. Without proper regularization, however, such
reconstruction is often overwhelmed by the noise of poorly constrained modes.
An intuitive regularization scheme is to assume a priori the dark energy EoS to
evolve at most slowly with time, which may be enforced by a correlation between
the EoS at different epochs. Indeed, studies that impose the correlation prior
are able to significantly reduce the uncertainties of the reconstructed EoS and
even show hints for dynamical dark energy.
  In this work, we examine the correlation prior using mock datasets of type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs), age-derived Hubble
parameter, Hubble constant, and cosmic microwave background. We find that even
though the prior is designed to disfavor evolving equations of state, it can
still accommodate spurious oscillating features at high significance. Within
the 1000 mock datasets of existing observations that are generated for the
concordance cosmological model, i.e., the input dark energy EoS $w=-1$, there
are 688 (69) cases recovering an EoS that departs from $-1$ by more than
$1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) in one or more redshift bins. The reconstructed EoS turns
up and down markedly in many cases. Moreover, inverting the signs of the
randomly assigned errors of the mock data more or less reverses the behavior of
the EoS. Spurious results occur even more frequently when idealized SN Ia and
BAO data from future surveys are included. Our tests suggest that further
studies are needed to ensure accurate reconstruction of the EoS with the
correlation prior.

set $S$ of $|S|=s$ nodes in a network with maximum influence. With stochastic
diffusion models, the influence of a set $S$ of seed nodes is defined as the
expectation of its reachability over simulations, where each simulation
specifies a deterministic reachability function. Two well-studied special cases
are the Independent Cascade (IC) and the Linear Threshold (LT) models of Kempe,
Kleinberg, and Tardos. The influence function in stochastic diffusion is
unbiasedly estimated by averaging reachability values over i.i.d. simulations.
We study the IM sample complexity: the number of simulations needed to
determine a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate maximizer with confidence $1-\delta$.
Our main result is a surprising upper bound of $O( s \tau \epsilon^{-2} \ln
\frac{n}{\delta})$ for a broad class of models that includes IC and LT models
and their mixtures, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $\tau$ is the number
of diffusion steps. Generally $\tau \ll n$, so this significantly improves over
the generic upper bound of $O(s n \epsilon^{-2} \ln \frac{n}{\delta})$. Our
sample complexity bounds are derived from novel upper bounds on the variance of
the reachability that allow for small relative error for influential sets and
additive error when influence is small. Moreover, we provide a data-adaptive
method that can detect and utilize fewer simulations on models where it
suffices. Finally, we provide an efficient greedy design that computes an
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximate maximizer from simulations and applies to any
submodular stochastic diffusion model that satisfies the variance bounds.

task in fashion analysis, which can decode the secret of clothing matching. The
main idea of this task is to map items into a latent style space where

by minimizing the distances between annotated compatible items, which require
massive item-level supervision. However, these annotated data are expensive to
obtain and hard to cover the numerous items with various styles in real
applications. In such cases, these supervised methods fail to achieve
satisfactory performances. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised method to
learn the compatibility across categories. We observe that the distributions of
different categories have intrinsic similar structures. Accordingly, the better
distributions align, the closer compatible items across these categories
become. To achieve the alignment, we minimize the distances between
distributions with unsupervised adversarial learning, and also the distances
between some annotated compatible items which play the role of anchor points to
help align. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

constantly in communication with the control tower to follow orders, because
there is an airspace regulation to respect. In addition, if the control tower

affect the sensors. All these cases easily lead to contradictions. Switching to

The objective of this implementation is to validate a non-monotonic model which
allows to solve the question of incomplete and contradictory information. We
formalize the problem using default logic, a non-monotonic logic which allows
to find fixed-points in the face of contradictions. For the implementation, the

prohibitively serious delay in transferring input data from the end devices to
the cloud. To address this problem, the hybrid computing environments,
consisting of the cloud, edge and end devices, are adopted to offload DNN
layers by combining the larger layers (more amount of data) in the cloud and
the smaller layers (less amount of data) at the edge and end devices. A key
issue in hybrid computing environments is how to minimize the system cost while
accomplishing the offloaded layers with their deadline constraints. In this
paper, a self-adaptive discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm
using the genetic algorithm (GA) operators was proposed to reduce the system
cost caused by data transmission and layer execution. This approach considers
the characteristics of DNNs partitioning and layers offloading over the cloud,
edge and end devices. The mutation operator and crossover operator of GA were
adopted to avert the premature convergence of PSO, which distinctly reduces the
system cost through enhanced population diversity of PSO. The proposed
offloading strategy is compared with benchmark solutions, and the results show
that our strategy can effectively reduce the cost of offloading for DNN-based
applications over the cloud, edge and end devices relative to the benchmarks.

by the numerical simulations, that this limit is $\delta_c = 0.40$, which is
slightly below the one quoted in the literature. Additionally, we show that the
profile dependence of the threshold for the compaction function is only
sensitive to its curvature at the maximum. We use these results to provide an
analytic formula for the threshold amplitude of the compaction function at its
maximum in terms of the normalised compaction function curvature at $r_m$.

  explosion simulations","To be submitted in two days to allow comments by readers",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I analyse recent three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of exploding
core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and find that a rapid increase in the
diagnostic explosion energy occurs parallel to, or very shortly after, the
accretion of gas with relatively large amount of angular momentum and/or
specific angular momentum. The tendency towards a positive correlation between
angular momentum accretion and the increase in the explosion energy appears
despite the absence of magnetic fields in the simulations. I speculate that the
inclusion of magnetic fields would make this positive correlation much stronger
and would increase the explosion energy. At times, the high angular momentum
accretion leads to a bipolar outflow that in some cases changes directions. I
argue that there is a mutual influence between neutrino heating and stochastic
angular momentum, and that both operate together to explode the star with
bipolar outflows that change directions, namely, jittering jets. This study
calls for a deep flow analysis of simulations of CCSNe, e.g., to present the
flow structure, the density, and the angular momentum of the flow near the
newly born neutron star (NS).

learning and a large amount of labelled training data. However, it remains a
challenging task for adapting a model trained in a source domain of labelled
data to a target domain of only unlabelled data available. In this work, we
develop a self-training method with progressive augmentation framework (PAST)
to promote the model performance progressively on the target dataset.
Specially, our PAST framework consists of two stages, namely, conservative
stage and promoting stage. The conservative stage captures the local structure
of target-domain data points with triplet-based loss functions, leading to
improved feature representations. The promoting stage continuously optimizes
the network by appending a changeable classification layer to the last layer of
the model, enabling the use of global information about the data distribution.
Importantly, we propose a new self-training strategy that progressively
augments the model capability by adopting conservative and promoting stages
alternately. Furthermore, to improve the reliability of selected triplet
samples, we introduce a ranking-based triplet loss in the conservative stage,
which is a label-free objective function basing on the similarities between
data pairs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art person Re-ID performance under the unsupervised cross-domain

propagating through a streamer-like magnetic field by solving the Parker
transport equation with spatial diffusion both along and across the magnetic
field. We show that the location on the shock where the high-energy particle
intensity is the largest, depends on the energy of the particles and on time.
The acceleration of particles to more than 100 MeV mainly occurs in the
shock-streamer interaction region, due to perpendicular shock geometry and the
trapping effect of closed magnetic fields. A comparison of the particle spectra
to that in a radial magnetic field shows that the intensity at 100 MeV (200
MeV) is enhanced by more than one order (two orders) of magnitude. This
indicates that the streamer-like magnetic field can be an important factor in
producing large solar energetic particle events. We also show that the energy
spectrum integrated over the simulation domain consists of two different power
laws. Further analysis suggests that it may be a mixture of two distinct
populations accelerated in the streamer and open field regions, where the
acceleration rate differs substantially. Our calculations also show that the
particle spectra are affected considerably by a number of parameters, such as
the streamer tilt angle, particle spatial diffusion coefficient, and shock
compression ratio. While the low-energy spectra agree well with standard
diffusive shock acceleration theory, the break energy ranges from $\sim$1 MeV

slope of $\sim$2-3.

number of unknown state energies are needed. Here, we report measurements of
the $^2$P$_{3/2}$ and $^2$D$_{5/2}$ hyperfine splittings, as well as the
$^2$P$_{3/2}$$\leftrightarrow$ $^2$S$_{1/2}$and $^2$P$_{3/2}$ $\leftrightarrow$
$^2$D$_{5/2}$ transition frequencies. Using these transitions, we demonstrate
high fidelity $^{133}$Ba$^+$ hyperfine qubit manipulation with electron
shelving detection to benchmark qubit state preparation and measurement (SPAM).
Using single-shot, threshold discrimination, we measure an average SPAM
fidelity of $\mathcal{F} = 0.99971(6)$, a factor of $\approx$ 2 improvement
over the best reported performance of any qubit.

equipped with an object grouping management scheme which handles occlusion
problems with two main parts. The first part is ""track merging"" which can merge
the false positive tracks caused by false positive detections from occlusions,
where the false positive tracks are usually occluded with a measure. The
measure is the occlusion ratio between visual objects,
sum-of-intersection-over-area (SIOA) we defined instead of the IOU metric. The
second part is ""occlusion group energy minimization (OGEM)"" which prevents the
occluded true positive tracks from false ""track merging"". We define each group
of the occluded objects as an energy function and find an optimal hypothesis
which makes the energy minimal. We evaluate the proposed tracker in benchmark
datasets such as MOT15 and MOT17 which are built for multi-person tracking. An
ablation study in training dataset shows that not only ""track merging"" and
""OGEM"" complement each other but also the proposed tracking method has more
robust performance and less sensitive to parameters than baseline methods.
Also, SIOA works better than IOU for various sizes of false positives.
Experimental results show that the proposed tracker efficiently handles
occlusion situations and achieves competitive performance compared to the
state-of-the-art methods. Especially, our method shows the best multi-object

tasks, it only focuses on the posterior probability of correct class when the

and meaningful but very challenging topic. Recently, the advancements of deep
generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have supported
the object generation from neurological signals. However, the
Electroencephalograph (EEG)-based shape generation still suffer from the low
realism problem. In particular, the generated geometrical shapes lack clear
edges and fail to contain necessary details. In light of this, we propose a
novel multi-task generative adversarial network to convert the individual's EEG
signals evoked by geometrical shapes to the original geometry. First, we adopt
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn highly informative latent
representation for the raw EEG signals, which is vital for the subsequent shape
reconstruction. Next, we build the discriminator based on multi-task learning
to distinguish and classify fake samples simultaneously, where the mutual
promotion between different tasks improves the quality of the recovered shapes.
Then, we propose a semantic alignment constraint in order to force the

improving classification performance. However, studies have shown inconsistent
results for different MCSs, and it is often difficult to predict which MCS
algorithm works the best on a particular problem. We believe that the two
crucial steps of MCS - base classifier generation and multiple classifier
combination, need to be designed coordinately to produce robust results.
  In this work, we show that for different testing instances, better
classifiers may be trained from different subdomains of training instances
including, for example, neighboring instances of the testing instance, or even
instances far away from the testing instance. To utilize this intuition, we
propose Individualized Classifier Ensemble (ICE). ICE groups training data into
overlapping clusters, builds a classifier for each cluster, and then associates
each training instance to the top-performing models while taking into account
model types and frequency. In testing, ICE finds the k most similar training
instances for a testing instance, then predicts class label of the testing
instance by averaging the prediction from models associated with these training
instances.
  Evaluation results on 49 benchmarks show that ICE has a stable improvement on
a significant proportion of datasets over existing MCS methods. ICE provides a
novel choice of utilizing internal patterns among instances to improve
classification, and can be easily combined with various classification models
and applied to many application domains.

image restoration. Most existing methods restore a desirable HS image by
solving some optimization problem, which consists of a regularization term(s)
and a data-fidelity term(s). The methods have to handle a regularization
term(s) and a data-fidelity term(s) simultaneously in one objective function,
and so we need to carefully control the hyperparameter(s) that balances these
terms. However, the setting of such hyperparameters is often a troublesome task
because their suitable values depend strongly on the regularization terms
adopted and the noise intensities on a given observation. Our proposed method
is formulated as a convex optimization problem, where we utilize a novel hybrid
regularization technique named Hybrid Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (HSSTV)
and incorporate data-fidelity as hard constraints. HSSTV has a strong ability
of noise and artifact removal while avoiding oversmoothing and spectral
distortion, without combining other regularizations such as low-rank
modeling-based ones. In addition, the constraint-type data-fidelity enables us
to translate the hyperparameters that balance between regularization and
data-fidelity to the upper bounds of the degree of data-fidelity that can be
set in a much easier manner. We also develop an efficient algorithm based on
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently solve the
optimization problem. Through comprehensive experiments, we illustrate the
advantages of the proposed method over various HS image restoration methods
including state-of-the-art ones.

Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies were studied. Their
X-ray spectra were all reproduced with a multi-color disk emission model plus
its Comptonization. However, the spectral shapes of individual sources changed
systematically depending on the luminosity, and defined three typical spectral
states. These states differ either in the ratio between the Comptonizing
electron temperature and the innermost disk temperature, or in the product of
Compton y-parameter and fraction of the Comptonized disk photons. The
luminosity range at which a particular state emerges was found to scatter by a
factor of up to 16 among the eight ULXs. By further assuming that the spectral
state is uniquely determined by the Eddington ratio, the sample ULXs are
inferred to exhibit a similar scatter in their masses. This gives a
model-independent support to the interpretation of ULXs in terms of relatively
massive black holes. None of the spectra showed noticeable local structures.
Especially, no Fe K-shell absorption/emission lines were detected, with upper
limits of $30-40$ eV in equivalent width from the brightest three among the
sample; NGC 1313 X-1, Holmberg IX X-1, and IC 342 X-1. These properties
disfavor ordinary mass accretion from a massive companion star, and suggest
direct Bondi-Hoyle accretion from dense parts of the interstellar medium.

$\alpha$ is introduced to control the bias of the diffusion process, such that
each individual prefers to move to one layer with more infected (or recovered)
neighbors for larger values of $\alpha$. Using stochastic simulations and
mean-field theory, we show that the type of phase transition from a
disease-free phase to an endemic phase depends on the value of $\alpha$. When
$\alpha$ is small enough, the system undergoes a usual continuous phase
transition as an effective spreading rate $\beta$ increases, as in single-layer
networks. Interestingly, when $\alpha$ exceeds a critical value the system
shows either a hybrid two-step phase transition or a one-step discontinuous
phase transition as $\beta$ increases. The former contains a continuous
transition between the disease-free phase and a low-prevalence endemic phase,
and a discontinuous transition between the low-prevalence endemic phase and a
high-prevalence endemic phase. For the latter, only a discontinuous transition
occurs from the disease-free phase directly to the high-prevalence endemic
phase. Moreover, we show that the discontinuous transition is always
accompanied by a spontaneous symmetry breaking in occupation probabilities of

not designed for such a low inertia system, this might make the system
vulnerable to disturbances. In this paper, we will investigate whether the
currently used control mechanisms are able to keep a low inertia system stable
and how this is effected by the time delay between a frequency deviation and
the onset of the control action. We integrate the control mechanisms used in
continental Europe into a model of coupled oscillators which resembles the
second order Kuramoto model. This model is then used to investigate how the
interplay of changing inertia, network topology and delayed control effects the
stability of the interconnected power system. To identify regions in parameter

of these nuclei also contain a nuclear stellar cluster surrounding the black
hole. Here we consider the idea that the nuclear stellar cluster formed first
and that the supermassive black hole grew later. In particular we consider the
merger of three stellar clusters to form a nuclear stellar cluster, where some
of these clusters contain a single intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). In the
cases where multiple clusters contain IMBHs, we discuss whether the black holes
are likely to merge and whether such mergers are likely to result in the
ejection of the merged black hole from the nuclear stellar cluster. In some
cases, no supermassive black hole will form as any merger product is not
retained. This is a natural pathway to explain those galactic nuclei that
contain a nuclear stellar cluster but apparently lack a supermassive black
hole; M33 being a nearby example. Alternatively, if an IMBH merger product is
retained within the nuclear stellar cluster, it may subsequently grow, e.g. via
the tidal disruption of stars, to form a supermassive black hole.

correlated electron system remains a subject of active debates. We have
performed first systematic measurements of temperature-dependent spectra of
infrared conductivity of Tm0.19Yb0.81B12 at frequencies 40-35000 cm-1 and in
the temperature interval from 300 K down to 10 K. Analysis of the temperature
evolution of the observed absorption resonances is performed. Their origin is
associated with the Jahn-Teller instability in the cubic lattice which results
in the rattling modes of the rare earth ions and leads to emergence of both the
intra-gap mixed-type collective excitations and the dynamic charge stripes.
Temperature dependent effective mass of charge carriers is determined and a
picture is presented of the multiple relaxation channels and the transformation
of the manybody states at different temperatures. We argue in favor of
electronic phase separation scenario which is valid both for the
metal-insulator transition and for the formation of the nanoscale filamentary
structure in Tm1-xYbxB12 compounds.

  In this paper, we propose a novel neural model that generates a POI embedding

investigated in the geometry of two parallel branes in locally AdS spacetime

dimensions quasiperiodicity conditions are imposed with general phases and the
presence of a constant gauge field is assumed. Different types of boundary
conditions are discussed on the branes, including the bag boundary condition
and the conditions arising in $Z_{2}$-symmetric braneworld models. Nonzero
vacuum currents appear along the compact dimensions only. In the region between
the branes they are decomposed into the brane-free and brane-induced
contributions. Both these contributions are periodic functions of the magnetic
flux enclosed by compact dimensions with the period equal to the flux quantum.
Depending on the boundary conditions, the presence of the branes can either
increase or decrease the vacuum current density. For a part of boundary
conditions, a memory effect is present in the limit when one of the branes
tends to the AdS boundary. Unlike to the fermion condensate and the VEV of the
energy-momentum tensor, the VEV of the current density is finite on the branes.
Applications are given to higher-dimensional generalizations of the
Randall-Sundrum models with two branes and with toroidally compact subspace.
The features of the fermionic current are discussed in odd-dimensional parity
and time-reversal symmetric models. The corresponding results for
three-dimensional spacetime are applied to finite length curved graphene tubes
threaded by a magnetic flux. It is shown that a nonzero current density can
also appear in the absence of the magnetic flux if the fields corresponding to
two different points of the Brillouin zone obey different boundary conditions

this media, cartoon face recognition is a crucial but less-explored task with
few datasets proposed. In this work, we first present a new challenging
benchmark dataset, consisting of 389,678 images of 5,013 cartoon characters
annotated with identity, bounding box, pose, and other auxiliary attributes.
The dataset, named iCartoonFace, is currently the largest-scale, high-quality,
richannotated, and spanning multiple occurrences in the field of image
recognition, including near-duplications, occlusions, and appearance changes.
In addition, we provide two types of annotations for cartoon media, i.e., face
recognition, and face detection, with the help of a semi-automatic labeling
algorithm. To further investigate this challenging dataset, we propose a
multi-task domain adaptation approach that jointly utilizes the human and
cartoon domain knowledge with three discriminative regularizations. We hence
perform a benchmark analysis of the proposed dataset and verify the superiority
of the proposed approach in the cartoon face recognition task. We believe this
public availability will attract more research attention in broad practical
application scenarios.

the effect of ionic size, Jahn-Teller (J-T) distortions and oxygen vacancies

This is done in the framework of warm inflation, where we show, for the first

slow-roll parameters larger than unity in a way that is both theoretically and
observationally consistent. The inflaton field corresponds to the relative
phase between two complex scalar fields that collectively break a U(1) gauge
symmetry, and dissipates its energy into scalar degrees of freedom in the warm

from large thermal corrections. We further show that the dissipation
coefficient decreases with temperature in certain parametric regimes, which
prevents a large growth of thermal inflaton fluctuations. We find, in

  (PRL)",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many versions of cross-validation (CV) exist in the literature; and each
version though has different variants. All are used interchangeably by many
practitioners; yet, without explanation to the connection or difference among
them. This article has three contributions. First, it starts by mathematical
formalization of these different versions and variants that estimate the error
rate and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of a classification rule, to show
the connection and difference among them. Second, we prove some of their
properties and prove that many variants are either redundant or ""not smooth"".
Hence, we suggest to abandon all redundant versions and variants and only keep
the leave-one-out, the $K$-fold, and the repeated $K$-fold. We show that the
latter is the only among the three versions that is ""smooth"" and hence looks
mathematically like estimating the mean performance of the classification
rules. However, empirically, for the known phenomenon of ""weak correlation"",
which we explain mathematically and experimentally, it estimates both
conditional and mean performance almost with the same accuracy. Third, we
conclude the article with suggesting two research points that may answer the
remaining question of whether we can come up with a finalist among the three
estimators: (1) a comparative study, that is much more comprehensive than those
available in literature and conclude no overall winner, is needed to consider a
wide range of distributions, datasets, and classifiers including complex ones
obtained via the recent deep learning approach. (2) we sketch the path of
deriving a rigorous method for estimating the variance of the only ""smooth""
version, repeated $K$-fold CV, rather than those ad-hoc methods available in
the literature that ignore the covariance structure among the folds of CV.

the drivers of the mobility of talent, as well as the implications of these

extent to which researchers have worked in more than two countries is
essential. This study focuses on the subgroup of highly mobile researchers whom
we refer to as peripatetic researchers or super-movers.
  More specifically, our aim is to track the international movements of
researchers who have published in more than two countries through changes in
the main affiliation addresses of researchers in over 62 million publications
indexed in the Web of Science database over the 1956-2016 period. Using this
approach, we have established a longitudinal dataset on the international
movements of highly mobile researchers across all subject categories, and in
all disciplines of scholarship. This article contributes to the literature by
offering for the first time a snapshot of the key features of highly mobile

academic age, the relative frequency of their disciplines, and the relative
frequency of their countries of origin and destination. Among other findings,
the results point to the emergence of a global system that includes the USA and

problems, such as super-resolution or image synthesis. However, to date, little
consideration has been given to uncertainty quantification over the output
image. Here we introduce methods to characterise different components of
uncertainty in such problems and demonstrate the ideas using diffusion MRI
super-resolution. Specifically, we propose to account for $intrinsic$
uncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model and for $parameter$
uncertainty through approximate Bayesian inference, and integrate the two to
quantify $predictive$ uncertainty over the output image. Moreover, we introduce
a method to propagate the predictive uncertainty on a multi-channelled image to
derived scalar parameters, and separately quantify the effects of intrinsic and
parameter uncertainty therein. The methods are evaluated for super-resolution
of two different signal representations of diffusion MR images---DTIs and Mean
Apparent Propagator MRI---and their derived quantities such as MD and FA, on
multiple datasets of both healthy and pathological human brains. Results
highlight three key benefits of uncertainty modelling for improving the safety
of DL-based image enhancement systems. Firstly, incorporating uncertainty
improves the predictive performance even when test data departs from training
data. Secondly, the predictive uncertainty highly correlates with errors, and
is therefore capable of detecting predictive ""failures"". Results demonstrate
that such an uncertainty measure enables subject-specific and voxel-wise risk
assessment of the output images. Thirdly, we show that the method for
decomposing predictive uncertainty into its independent sources provides
high-level ""explanations"" for the performance by quantifying how much
uncertainty arises from the inherent difficulty of the task or the limited
training examples.

leads to a new regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics, where the light-matter
interaction dynamics is fundamentally different from that observed in a
conventional cavity with Lorenztian lineshape. Furthermore, when the
vibrational dynamics of the emitter is taken into account, an intricate
phonon-photon interplay arises, and the optical interference induced by the
Fano mirror significantly alters the leakage of energy into vibrational modes.
We demonstrate that this control mechanism improves the maximum attainable
indistinguishability of emitted photons, as compared to an equivalent cavity

an excellent probe of the extended and possibly evaporating atmospheres of
close-in transiting planets. This has already resulted in detections of this
triplet in the atmospheres of a handful of planets, both from space and from
the ground. However, while a strong signal is expected for the hot Jupiter HD
209458 b, only upper limits have been obtained so far. Aims: Our goal is to
measure the helium excess absorption from HD 209458 b and assess the extended
atmosphere of the planet and possible evaporation. Methods: We obtained new
high-resolution spectral transit time-series of HD 209458 b using CARMENES at
the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope, targeting the He I triplet at 10830 \r{A} at a
spectral resolving power of 80 400. The observed spectra were corrected for
stellar absorption lines using out of transit data, for telluric absorption
using the molecfit software, and for the sky emission lines using simultaneous
sky measurements through a second fibre. Results: We detect He I absorption at
a level of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.10 % (9 $\sigma$) at mid-transit. The absorption
follows the radial velocity change of the planet during transit, unambiguously
identifying the planet as the source of the absorption. The core of the
absorption exhibits a net blueshift of 1.8 $\pm$ 1.3 km s$^{-1}$. Possible
low-level excess absorption is seen further blueward from the main absorption
near the centre of the transit, which could be caused by an extended tail.
However, this needs to be confirmed. Conclusions: Our results further support a
close relationship between the strength of planetary absorption in the helium
triplet lines and the level of ionising, stellar X-ray and extreme-UV
irradiation.

develop an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, which
uses preconditioned Krylov subspace solvers for the resulting sub-problems. The
latter allows us to tackle a range of Partial Differential Equation (PDE)
optimization problems with box constraints, posed on space-time domains, that
were previously out of the reach of state-of-the-art preconditioners. In
particular, by making use of the powerful Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT)
sequences theory, we show that any existing GLT structure present in the
problem matrices is preserved by ADMM, and we propose some preconditioning
methodologies that could be used within the solver, to demonstrate the
generality of the approach. Focusing on convex quadratic programs with
time-dependent 2-dimensional FDE constraints, we derive multilevel circulant
preconditioners, which may be embedded within Krylov subspace methods, for
solving the ADMM sub-problems. Discretized versions of FDEs involve large dense
linear systems. In order to overcome this difficulty, we design a recursive
linear algebra, which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We manage
to keep the storage requirements linear, with respect to the grid size $N$,
while ensuring an order $N \log N$ computational complexity per iteration of
the Krylov solver. We implement the proposed method, and demonstrate its
scalability, generality, and efficiency, through a series of experiments over

direction of each particle is chosen to be parallel to its dipole moment. We
explore a wide range of motilities and dipolar coupling strengths and
characterize the corresponding behavior based on several order parameters. At
low densities and low motilities, the most important structural phenomenon is
the aggregation of the dipolar particles into chains. Upon increasing the
particle motility, these chain-like structures break, and the system transforms
into a weakly correlated isotropic fluid. At high densities, we observe that
the motility-induced phase separation is strongly suppressed by the dipolar
coupling. Once the dipolar coupling dominates the thermal energy, the phase
separation disappears, and the system rather displays a flocking state, where
particles form giant clusters and move collective along one direction. We
provide arguments for the emergence of the flocking behavior, which is absent

analytical forms with the advantages of computing likelihood and efficiency of

parameters of the proposed models. We provide sufficient conditions to realize
the expectation-maximization based learning. The main requirements are
invertibility of neural networks that are used as generators and Jacobian
computation of functional form of the neural networks. The requirements are
practically realized using a flow-based neural network. In our first mixture
model, we use multiple flow-based neural networks as generators. Naturally the
model is complex. A single latent variable is used as the common input to all
the neural networks. The second mixture model uses a single flow-based neural
network as a generator to reduce complexity. The single generator has a latent
variable input that follows a Gaussian mixture distribution. We demonstrate
efficiency of proposed mixture models through extensive experiments for
generating samples and maximum likelihood based classification.

carried out with JOREK, which solves a large sparse matrix system iteratively
in each time step. For the preconditioning, a direct solver is applied in the
code to sub-matrices, and at this point BLR was applied with the results being
summarized in this report. For a simple case with a linearly growing mode,
results with both solvers look promising with a considerable reduction of the
memory consumption by several ten percent was obtained. A direct increase in
performance was seen in particular configurations already.
  The choice of the BLR accuracy parameter $\epsilon$ proves to be critical in
this simple test and also in more realistic simulations, which were carried out
only with MUMPS due to the limited time available. The more realistic test
showed an increase in run time when using BLR, which was mitigated when using
larger values of $\epsilon$. However, the GMRes iterative solver does not reach
convergence anymore when $\epsilon$ is too large, since the preconditioner
becomes too inaccurate in that case. It is thus critical to use an $\epsilon$
as large as possible, while still reaching convergence. More tests regarding
this optimum will be necessary in the future. BLR can also lead to an indirect
speed-up in particular cases, when the simulation can be run on a smaller
number of compute nodes due to the reduced memory consumption.

debated issues in astrophysics.
  Here, we explore the possible link between the quasi-universal filamentary
structure of star-forming molecular clouds and the origin of the IMF.
  Based on our recent comprehensive study of filament properties from Herschel
Gould Belt survey observations (Arzoumanian et al.), we derive, for the first
time, a good estimate of the filament mass function (FMF) and filament line
mass function (FLMF) in nearby molecular clouds. We use the observed FLMF to
propose a simple toy model for the origin of the prestellar core mass function
(CMF), relying on gravitational fragmentation of thermally supercritical but
virialized filaments.
  We find that the FMF and the FLMF have very similar shapes and are both
consistent with a Salpeter-like power-law function (d$N$/dlog$M_{\rm line}
\propto M_{\rm line}^{-1.5\pm0.1}$) in the regime of thermally supercritical
filaments ($M_{\rm line} > 16\, M_\odot$/pc). This is a remarkable result
since, in contrast, the mass distribution of molecular clouds and clumps is
known to be significantly shallower than the Salpeter power-law IMF, with
d$N$/dlog$M_{\rm cl} \propto M_{\rm cl}^{-0.7}$.
  Since the vast majority of prestellar cores appear to form in thermally
transcritical or supercritical filaments, we suggest that the prestellar CMF
and by extension the stellar IMF are at least partly inherited from the FLMF
through gravitational fragmentation of individual filaments.

is the quantification of the conductivity and permittivity of different
tissues. These electrical properties can be obtained through different
reconstruction methods and can be used as a contrast mechanism. The work
presented here continues from the two-dimensional CSI-EPT algorithm which was
shown to work with two-dimensional Matlab based simulations. The existing
CSI-EPT algorithm is reformulated to use the transceive phase rather than
relying on the transceive phase assumption. This is achieved by implementing a
forward problem, computing the receive phase, into the inverse minimization
problem, i.e. retrieving the electrical properties. Furthermore, the radio
frequency (RF) shield is numerically implemented to model the RF fields inside
the MRI more accurately. Afterwards, the algorithm is tested with
three-dimensional FDTD simulations to investigate if the two-dimensional
CSI-EPT can retrieve the electrical properties for three-dimensional RF fields.
Finally, an MR experiment with a phantom is performed to show the potential for
this method. From the results of the two-dimensional Matlab simulations it is
seen that CSI-EPT can reconstruct the electrical properties using MRI
accessible quantities. In the three-dimensional simulations it is observed that
the electrical properties are underestimated, nonetheless, CSI-EPT is more
precise than the standard Helmholtz based methods. Finally, the first CSI-EPT
results using measured data are shown. The results for the reconstruction using
measured data were of the same quality as the results from the FDTD simulation.

it is difficult to predict the cascading failure paths once the cascades occur.
This makes it challenging to achieve the effective power system protection
against cascading blackouts. By incorporating uncertainties and stochastic
factors of the cascades, a Markov chain model is developed in this paper to
predict the cascading failure paths of power systems. The transition matrix of
Markov chain is dependent on the probability of branch outage caused by
overloads or stochastic factors. Moreover, a robust optimization formulation is
proposed to deal with the cascading blackouts by shedding load optimally for
multiple cascading failure paths with relatively high probabilities.
Essentially, it can be converted to the best approximation problem. Thus, an
efficient numerical solver based on Dykstra's algorithm is employed to deal
with the robust optimization problem. In theory, we provide a lower bound for
the probability of preventing the cascading blackouts of power systems.
Finally, the proposed approach for power system protection is verified by a
case study of IEEE 118 bus system.

intelligent agent needs to perform complex sequential decision-making tasks
that are often guided by commonsense knowledge. The previous work on this line
of research led to the framework called ""interleaved commonsense reasoning and
probabilistic planning"" (icorpp), which used P-log for representing
commmonsense knowledge and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or Partially
Observable MDPs (POMDPs) for planning under uncertainty. A main limitation of
icorpp is that its implementation requires non-trivial engineering efforts to
bridge the commonsense reasoning and probabilistic planning formalisms. In this
paper, we present a unified framework to integrate icorpp's reasoning and
planning components. In particular, we extend probabilistic action language
pBC+ to express utility, belief states, and observation as in POMDP models.
Inheriting the advantages of action languages, the new action language provides
an elaboration tolerant representation of POMDP that reflects commonsense
knowledge. The idea led to the design of the system pbcplus2pomdp, which
compiles a pBC+ action description into a POMDP model that can be directly
processed by off-the-shelf POMDP solvers to compute an optimal policy of the
pBC+ action description. Our experiments show that it retains the advantages of
icorpp while avoiding the manual efforts in bridging the commonsense reasoner
and the probabilistic planner.

queries for video datasets `in the wild' vary a lot in terms of degree of

goal is to condense the multi-modal, extremely high dimensional information
from videos into a single, compact video representation for the task of video

open-ended.
  For this we exploit existing knowledge in the form of pre-trained semantic
embeddings which include 'general' features such as motion, appearance, and
scene features from visual content. We also explore the use of more 'specific'
cues from ASR and OCR which are intermittently available for videos and find
that these signals remain challenging to use effectively for retrieval. We
propose a collaborative experts model to aggregate information from these
different pre-trained experts and assess our approach empirically on five

perturbations can often be predicted using linear response theory, but not all
chaotic systems possess a linear response. Macroscopic observables of complex
dissipative chaotic systems, however, are widely assumed to have a linear
response even if the microscopic variables do not, but the mechanism for this
is not well-understood.
  We present a comprehensive picture for the linear response of macroscopic
observables in high-dimensional coupled deterministic dynamical systems, where
the coupling is via a mean field and the microscopic subsystems may or may not
obey linear response theory. We derive stochastic reductions of the dynamics of
these observables from statistics of the microscopic system, and provide
conditions for linear response theory to hold in finite dimensional systems and
in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show that for large systems of
finite size, linear response is induced via self-generated noise.
  We present examples in the thermodynamic limit where the macroscopic
observable satisfies LRT, although the microscopic subsystems individually
violate LRT, as well a converse example where the macroscopic observable does
not satisfy LRT despite all microscopic subsystems satisfying LRT when
uncoupled. This latter, maybe surprising, example is associated with emergent
non-trivial dynamics of the macroscopic observable. We provide numerical
evidence for our results on linear response as well as some analytical
intuition.

Dam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity that is cured classically by the
nonlinear Vainshtein mechanism due to certain low scale strongly coupled
interactions. Here we show how both the vDVZ and strong coupling problems can
be removed by embedding 4D covariant massive gravity into a certain 5D warped
geometry. The 4D theory is a nonlinear strongly coupled massive gravity, that
is being coupled to a 5D bulk theory that generates a bulk graviton mass via a
one loop diagram. This induced mass leads to an additional 4D kinetic term for
the 4D longitudinal mode, even on flat space. Due to this kinetic term the 4D
massive theory becomes weakly coupled all the way up to a high energy scale set
by the bulk cosmological constant. The same effect leads to a suppression of
the interactions of the 4D longitudinal mode with a 4D matter stress-tensor,
thus removing the vDVZ discontinuity. The proposed mechanism has a pure 4D
holographic interpretation: a 4D nonlinear massive gravity mixes to a
non-conserved symmetric tensor of a 4D CFT that has a cutoff; the latter mixing
generates a large kinetic term for the longitudinal mode, and this makes the
longitudinal mode be weakly coupled to a matter stress-tensor, and weakly
self-coupled, all the way up to the scale of the 4D CFT cutoff.

the thick part of a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold N and the thick part of any of
its long Dehn fillings. Given a bilipschitz constant J > 1 and a thickness
constant epsilon > 0, we quantify how long a Dehn filling suffices to guarantee
a J-bilipschitz map on epsilon-thick parts. A similar theorem without
quantitative control was previously proved by Brock and Bromberg, applying
Hodgson and Kerckhoff's theory of cone deformations. We achieve quantitative
control by bounding the analytic quantities that control the infinitesimal
change in metric during the cone deformation.
  Our quantitative results have two immediate applications. First, we relate
the Margulis number of N to the Margulis numbers of its Dehn fillings. In
particular, we give a lower bound on the systole of any closed 3-manifold M

the volume of such a manifold, this gives a procedure to compute the finite
list of 3-manifolds whose Margulis numbers are below 0.29.

links and collaboratively decide what data to cache. Contents are placed at the

physics, underlying processes such as photosynthesis and nuclear fusion, as
well as devices ranging from SQUID magnetometers to superconducting qubits for
quantum computers. The question of how long a particle takes to tunnel,
however, has remained controversial since the first attempts to calculate it,
which relied on the group delay. It is now well understood that this delay (the
arrival time of the transmitted wave packet peak at the far side of the
barrier) can be smaller than the barrier thickness divided by the speed of
light, without violating causality. There have been a number of experiments
confirming this, and even a recent one claiming that tunnelling may take no
time at all. There have also been efforts to identify another timescale, which
would better describe how long a given particle spends in the barrier region.
Here we present a direct measurement of such a time, studying Bose-condensed
$^{87}$Rb atoms tunnelling through a 1.3-${\mu}$m thick optical barrier. By
localizing a pseudo-magnetic field inside the barrier, we use the spin
precession of the atoms as a clock to measure the time it takes them to cross
the classically forbidden region. We find a traversal time of 0.62(7) ms and
study its dependence on incident energy. In addition to finally shedding light
on the fundamental question of the tunnelling time, this experiment lays the
groundwork for addressing deep foundational questions about history in quantum
mechanics: for instance, what can we learn about where a particle was at
earlier times by observing where it is now?

interpretation methods, there is a group, named local estimators, which are
designed to explain how the label of particular instance is predicted. For
such, they induce interpretable models on the neighborhood of the instance to
be explained. Local estimators have been successfully used to explain specific
predictions. Although they provide some degree of model interpretability, it is
still not clear what is the best way to implement and apply them. Open
questions include: how to best define the neighborhood of an instance? How to
control the trade-off between the accuracy of the interpretation method and its
interpretability? How to make the obtained solution robust to small variations
on the instance to be explained? To answer to these questions, we propose and
investigate two strategies: (i) using data instance properties to provide
improved explanations, and (ii) making sure that the neighborhood of an
instance is properly defined by taking the geometry of the domain of the
feature space into account. We evaluate these strategies in a regression task
and present experimental results that show that they can improve local
explanations.

power the Universe's most massive black holes, we require a significant
increase in our knowledge of the molecular gas which exists in their immediate
surroundings. However, the behaviour of this gas is poorly understood due to
the difficulties associated with observing it directly. We report on a survey
of 18 brightest cluster galaxies lying in cool cores, from which we detect
molecular gas in the core regions of eight via carbon monoxide (CO), cyanide
(CN) and silicon monoxide (SiO) absorption lines. These absorption lines are
produced by cold molecular gas clouds which lie along the line of sight to the
bright continuum sources at the galaxy centres. As such, they can be used to
determine many properties of the molecular gas which may go on to fuel
supermassive black hole accretion and AGN feedback mechanisms. The absorption
regions detected have velocities ranging from -45 to 283 km s$^{-1}$ relative
to the systemic velocity of the galaxy, and have a bias for motion towards the
host supermassive black hole. We find that the CN N = 0 - 1 absorption lines
are typically 10 times stronger than those of CO J = 0 - 1. This is due to the
higher electric dipole moment of the CN molecule, which enhances its absorption
strength. In terms of molecular number density CO remains the more prevalent
molecule with a ratio of CO/CN $\sim 10$, similar to that of nearby galaxies.
Comparison of CO, CN and HI observations for these systems shows many different
combinations of these absorption lines being detected.

attracted intensive investigations due to the inherent uncertainty associated
with many real-world problems. For its robustness with respect to noise,
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been expected to have great potential for
dynamic optimization. On the other hand, EAs are also criticized for its high
computational complexity, which appears to be contradictory to the core
requirement of real-world dynamic optimization, i.e., fast adaptation
(typically in terms of wall-clock time) to the environmental change. So far,
whether EAs would indeed lead to a truly effective approach for real-world
dynamic optimization remain unclear. In this paper, a new framework of
employing EAs in the context of dynamic optimization is explored. We suggest
that, instead of online evolving (searching) solutions for the ever-changing
objective function, EAs are more suitable for acquiring an archive of solutions
in an offline way, which could be adopted to construct a system to provide
high-quality solutions efficiently in a dynamic environment. To be specific, we
first re-formulate dynamic optimization problems as static set-oriented
optimization problems. Then, a particular type of EAs, namely competitive
coevolution, is employed to search for the archive of solutions in an
adversarial way. The general framework is instantiated for continuous dynamic
constrained optimization problems, and the empirical results showed the
potential of the proposed framework.

regular way. We ascribe the absorption line variability in J1130+4952 to the
ionization change as a response to the fluctuation of the ionizing continuum

systems A and B, (2) the system B shows an obvious change in Si IV but no
significant change in C IV BAL, and (3) asynchronized variability between the

hold the view that the Type S and Type N BALs in J1130+4952 probe the same

outflow with a relatively higher ionization state, smaller column density, and
more clumpy structures, while the Type N BALs originate from the outer part of

there is a set $H\subseteq S$ of cardinality $\kappa$ which is
\emph{homogeneous} for $f$, meaning that $f\upharpoonright[H]^n$ is constant

normal ideal on $\kappa$. Sharpe and Welch \cite{MR2817562}, and independently
Bagaria \cite{MR3894041}, extended the notion of $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability

We study large cardinal properties and ideals which result from Ramseyness
properties in which homogeneous sets are demanded to be

on the various $\Pi^1_\xi$-indescribability ideals, we obtain new large
cardinal hierarchies and corresponding nonlinear increasing hierarchies of

properties yield a strict linear refinement of Feng's original Ramsey
hierarchy. We also show that, given any ordinals $\beta_0,\beta_1<\kappa$ the
increasing chains of ideals obtained by iterating the Ramsey operator on the

moreover, we identify the least degree of Ramseyness at which this equality

recently shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks introducing even very
small perturbations to the policy input. The attacks proposed so far have been
designed using heuristics, and build on existing adversarial example crafting
techniques used to dupe classifiers in supervised learning. In contrast, this
paper investigates the problem of devising optimal attacks, depending on a
well-defined attacker's objective, e.g., to minimize the main agent average
reward. When the policy and the system dynamics, as well as rewards, are known
to the attacker, a scenario referred to as a white-box attack, designing
optimal attacks amounts to solving a Markov Decision Process. For what we call
black-box attacks, where neither the policy nor the system is known, optimal
attacks can be trained using Reinforcement Learning techniques. Through
numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our attacks compared to
existing attacks (usually based on Gradient methods). We further quantify the
potential impact of attacks and establish its connection to the smoothness of
the policy under attack. Smooth policies are naturally less prone to attacks
(this explains why Lipschitz policies, with respect to the state, are more
resilient). Finally, we show that from the main agent perspective, the system
uncertainties and the attacker can be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process. We actually demonstrate that using Reinforcement Learning
techniques tailored to POMDP (e.g. using Recurrent Neural Networks) leads to
more resilient policies.

patterns of genetic variability produced by classical and recent population
genetic models related to seed banks. In particular, we are concerned with
models described by the Kingman coalescent (K), models exhibiting so-called
weak seed banks described by a time-changed Kingman coalescent (W), models with
so-called strong seed bank described by the seed bank coalescent (S) and the
classical two-island model by Wright, described by the structured coalescent
(TI). As the presence of a (strong) seed bank should stratify a population, we
expect it to produce a signal roughly comparable to the presence of population
structure.
  We begin with a brief analysis of Wright's $F_{ST}$, which is a classical but
crude measure for population structure, followed by a derivation of the
expected site frequency spectrum (SFS) in the infinite sites model based on
'phase-type distribution calculus' as recently discussed by Hobolth et al.
(2019). Both the $F_{ST}$ and the SFS can be readily computed under various
population models, they discard statistical signal. Hence we also derive exact
likelihoods for the full sampling probabilities, which can be achieved via
recursions and a Monte Carlo scheme both in the infinite alleles and the
infinite sites model. We employ a pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
of Andrieu and Roberts (2009) to provide a method for simultaneous model
selection and parameter inference under the so-called infinitely-many sites
model, which is the most relevant in real applications.
  It turns out that this full likelihood method can reliably distinguish among
the model classes (K, W), (S) and (TI) on the basis of simulated data even from
moderate sample sizes. It is also possible to infer mutation rates, and in
particular determine whether mutation is taking place in the (strong) seed
bank.

an end-to-end approach that automatically extracts an extensible timeline

reconstruction paradigm. At the deconstruction stage, we propose a multi-task
deep neural network that simultaneously parses two kinds of information from a
bitmap timeline: 1) the global information, i.e., the representation, scale,
layout, and orientation of the timeline, and 2) the local information, i.e.,
the location, category, and pixels of each visual element on the timeline. At
the reconstruction stage, we propose a pipeline with three techniques, i.e.,
Non-Maximum Merging, Redundancy Recover, and DL GrabCut, to extract an
extensible template from the infographic, by utilizing the deconstruction
results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we synthesize a
timeline dataset (4296 images) and collect a real-world timeline dataset (393
images) from the Internet. We first report quantitative evaluation results of
our approach over the two datasets. Then, we present examples of automatically
extracted templates and timelines automatically generated based on these
templates to qualitatively demonstrate the performance. The results confirm
that our approach can effectively extract extensible templates from real-world

significant environmental impacts. Computer models provide a useful tool for
understanding the behavior and projecting the future of Arctic and Antarctic
ice sheets. However, these models are typically subject to large parametric
uncertainties due to poorly constrained model input parameters that govern the
behavior of simulated ice sheets. Computer model calibration provides a formal
statistical framework to infer parameters using observational data, and to
quantify the uncertainty in projections due to the uncertainty in these
parameters. Calibration of ice sheet models is often challenging because the
relevant model output and observational data take the form of semi-continuous
spatial data, with a point mass at zero and a right-skewed continuous
distribution for positive values. Current calibration approaches cannot handle
such data. Here we introduce a hierarchical latent variable model that handles
binary spatial patterns and positive continuous spatial patterns as separate
components. To overcome challenges due to high-dimensionality we use
likelihood-based generalized principal component analysis to impose
low-dimensional structures on the latent variables for spatial dependence. We
apply our methodology to calibrate a physical model for the Antarctic ice sheet
and demonstrate that we can overcome the aforementioned modeling and
computational challenges. As a result of our calibration, we obtain improved
future ice-volume change projections.

sequences have been studied mostly in terms of interevent times (IETs), while
the higher-order correlation structure between IETs has gained very little
attention due to the lack of a proper characterization method. In this paper we
propose a method of decomposing an event sequence into a set of IETs and a
burst tree, which exactly captures the structure of temporal correlations that
is entirely missing in the analysis of IET distributions. We apply the
burst-tree decomposition method to various datasets and analyze the structure
of the revealed burst trees. In particular, we observe that event sequences
show similar burst-tree structure, such as heavy-tailed burst size
distributions, despite of very different IET distributions. The burst trees
allow us to directly characterize the preferential and assortative mixing
structure of bursts responsible for the higher-order temporal correlations. We
also show how to use the decomposition method for the systematic investigation
of such higher-order correlations captured by the burst trees in the framework
of randomized reference models. Finally, we devise a simple kernel-based model
for generating event sequences showing appropriate higher-order temporal
correlations. Our method is a tool to make the otherwise overwhelming analysis
of higher-order correlations in bursty time series tractable by turning it into

ramifications for understanding Earth's O2 cycle, the evolution of complex life
and evolving climate stability. However, the regulatory mechanisms and redox
fluxes required to stabilize these O2 levels in the face of continued
biological oxygen production remain uncertain. Here, we develop a
biogeochemical model of the C-N-P-O2-S cycles and use it to constrain global
redox balance in the mid-Proterozoic ocean-atmosphere system. By employing a
Monte Carlo approach bounded by observations from the geologic record, we infer
that the rate of net biospheric O2 production was 3.5 (+1.4 - 1.1) Tmol year-1
(1-sigma), or ~25% of today's value, owing largely to phosphorus scarcity in
the ocean interior. Pyrite burial in marine sediments would have represented a
comparable or more significant O2 source than organic carbon burial, implying a
potentially important role for Earth's sulphur cycle in balancing the oxygen
cycle and regulating atmospheric O2 levels. Our statistical approach provides a
uniquely comprehensive view of Earth system biogeochemistry and global O2
cycling during mid-Proterozoic time and implicates severe P biolimitation as

guidelines for how to configure a successful model. This means model builders
often have to experiment with different configurations by manually programming
different architectures (which is tedious and time consuming) or rely on purely
automated approaches to generate and train the architectures (which is
expensive). In this paper, we present Rapid Exploration of Model Architectures
and Parameters, or REMAP, a visual analytics tool that allows a model builder
to discover a deep learning model quickly via exploration and rapid
experimentation of neural network architectures. In REMAP, the user explores
the large and complex parameter space for neural network architectures using a
combination of global inspection and local experimentation. Through a visual
overview of a set of models, the user identifies interesting clusters of
architectures. Based on their findings, the user can run ablation and variation
experiments to identify the effects of adding, removing, or replacing layers in
a given architecture and generate new models accordingly. They can also
handcraft new models using a simple graphical interface. As a result, a model
builder can build deep learning models quickly, efficiently, and without manual
programming. We inform the design of REMAP through a design study with four
deep learning model builders. Through a use case, we demonstrate that REMAP
allows users to discover performant neural network architectures efficiently

identify a user's preference in the cold state, existing recommender systems,
such as Netflix, initially provide items to a user; we call those items
evidence candidates. Recommendations are then made based on the items selected
by the user. Previous recommendation studies have two limitations: (1) the
users who consumed a few items have poor recommendations and (2) inadequate
evidence candidates are used to identify user preferences. We propose a
meta-learning-based recommender system called MeLU to overcome these two
limitations. From meta-learning, which can rapidly adopt new task with a few
examples, MeLU can estimate new user's preferences with a few consumed items.
In addition, we provide an evidence candidate selection strategy that
determines distinguishing items for customized preference estimation. We
validate MeLU with two benchmark datasets, and the proposed model reduces at

unsupervised and semi-supervised scenarios. Graph-level representations are
critical in a variety of real-world applications such as predicting the
properties of molecules and community analysis in social networks. Traditional
graph kernel based methods are simple, yet effective for obtaining fixed-length
representations for graphs but they suffer from poor generalization due to
hand-crafted designs. There are also some recent methods based on language
models (e.g. graph2vec) but they tend to only consider certain substructures
(e.g. subtrees) as graph representatives. Inspired by recent progress of
unsupervised representation learning, in this paper we proposed a novel method
called InfoGraph for learning graph-level representations. We maximize the
mutual information between the graph-level representation and the
representations of substructures of different scales (e.g., nodes, edges,
triangles). By doing so, the graph-level representations encode aspects of the
data that are shared across different scales of substructures. Furthermore, we
further propose InfoGraph*, an extension of InfoGraph for semi-supervised
scenarios. InfoGraph* maximizes the mutual information between unsupervised
graph representations learned by InfoGraph and the representations learned by
existing supervised methods. As a result, the supervised encoder learns from
unlabeled data while preserving the latent semantic space favored by the
current supervised task. Experimental results on the tasks of graph
classification and molecular property prediction show that InfoGraph is
superior to state-of-the-art baselines and InfoGraph* can achieve performance
competitive with state-of-the-art semi-supervised models.

SVRG is an inner-outer loop based method, where in the outer loop a reference
full gradient is evaluated, after which $m \in \mathbb{N}$ steps of an inner
loop are executed where the reference gradient is used to build a variance
reduced estimate of the current gradient. The simplicity of the SVRG method and
its analysis have led to multiple extensions and variants for even non-convex
optimization. We provide a more general analysis of SVRG than had been
previously done by using arbitrary sampling, which allows us to analyse
virtually all forms of mini-batching through a single theorem. Furthermore, our
analysis is focused on more practical variants of SVRG including a new variant
of the loopless SVRG (Hofman et al 2015, Kovalev et al 2019, Kulunchakov and

perform effective resource sharing. In this paper, we exploit deep learning to
promote coordination among multiple vehicles and propose a hybrid architecture
consisting of centralized decision making and distributed resource sharing to
maximize the long-term sum rate of all vehicles. To reduce the network
signaling overhead, each vehicle uses a deep neural network to compress its own
observed information that is thereafter fed back to the centralized
decision-making unit, which employs a deep Q-network to allocate resources and
then sends the decision results to all vehicles. We further adopt a
quantization layer for each vehicle that learns to quantize the continuous
feedback. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid

optimal number of continuous feedback and binary feedback, respectively.
Besides, this architecture is robust to different feedback intervals, input

generation (5G) networks. In this article, we provide an accessible
introduction to the general idea of federated learning, discuss several
possible applications in 5G networks, and describe key technical challenges and
open problems for future research on federated learning in the context of
wireless communications.

  Einstein's conceptions of physical theories. Quantum physics as a theory of
  general relativity of experimental context",,,,,"physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In glaring contrast to its indisputable century-old experimental success, the
ultimate objects and meaning of quantum physics remain a matter of vigorous
debate among physicists and philosophers of science. This article attempts to
shed new light on the debate. It relies upon two comments by Albert Einstein on
his general approach to physical theories. I draw their consequences for the
definition of a physical theory's ontology, and next for the ontology of
quantum physics - i.e. what it may ultimately be about. The quantum ontology
thus derived appears to be strictly limited to evolving experimental contexts
and instantaneous measurement outcomes, which are to be understood,
respectively, as mere potential measurement outcomes and actual ones. The
notions of material body in particular and physical system in general are
absent from this ontology, hence the vanishing of Schroedinger's cat and EPR
paradoxes, as well as of the quantum measurement problem. Apart from its
ability to clear up well-known conundrums, this ontology reveals what quantum
physics may fundamentally be - i.e. its possible ultimate meaning - namely a
theory of general relativity of experimental context. On this basis, I conclude
with a new conception of objectivity in the sciences of nature.

DC magnetization (M) measurements performed in the temperature (T) interval of
20 to 175 K,under an applied magnetic field (H) ranging between 50 and 1250 Oe.
Magnetization curves were recorded in the field-cooled (FC) and in the
zero-field-cooled (ZFC) modes. They clearly showed an irreversible character
that vanished at H=1250 Oe. Both magnetization curves exhibited well-defined
peaks around T_N =72.3 K whose positions were H-independent, so they were
identified as the compound's N\'eel temperature. The existence of
irreversibility which decreases with H testify to a re-entrant character of
magnetism in the studied compound. An increase of both MFC and MZFC observed
below TN likely indicates a mixed i.e. ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
ground magnetic state of the studied system.

Frequency
of the variation is much smaller then the natural frequency of the oscillator
so that oscillations in the system are periodically excited and decay. Also a
time delay as added such that when the oscillations start to grow at a new
excitation stage they are influenced via the delay line by the oscillations at
the penultimate excitation stage. Due to a nonlinearity the seeding from the
past arrives with a doubled phase so that oscillation phase changes from stage
to stage according to chaotic Bernoulli-type map. As a result, the system
operates as two coupled hyperbolic chaotic subsystems. Varying the relation
between the delay time and the excitation period we affect a coupling strength
between these subsystems as well as intensity of the phase doubling mechanism
responsible for the hyperbolicity. Due to this, a transition from
non-hyperbolic to hyperbolic hyperchaos occurs. The following steps of the
transition scenario are revealed and analyzed: (a) an intermittency as
alternation of long staying near a fixed point at the origin and short chaotic
bursts; (b) chaotic oscillations with often visits to the fixed point; (c)
plain hyperchaos without hyperbolicity after termination visiting the fixed
point; (d) transformation of hyperchaos to hyperbolic form.

acoustic devices, deflection of a membrane is utilized for pressure or sound
measurements. Due to advantages of capacitive pressure sensor over
piezoresistive pressure sensors (low power consumption, less sensitive to
temperature drift, higher dynamic range, high sensitivity), capacitive pressure
sensors are the 2nd largest useable MEMS-based sensor after piezoresistive
pressure sensors. We present a normal capacitive pressure sensor, for
continuous sensing of normal and abnormal Intraocular Pressure (IOP). The
composite membrane of the sensor is made of three materials, i.e., Si, SiO2 and
Si3N4. The membrane deflection, capacitance variation, mechanical sensitivity,
capacitive sensitivity and non-linearity are discussed in this work.
Mathematical modeling is performed for analytical simulation, which is also
compared with Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. MATLAB is used for
analytical simulations and CoventorWare is used for FEM simulations. The
variation in analytical result of deflection in membrane w.r.t. FEM result is
about 7.19%, and for capacitance, the variation is about 2.7% at maximum
pressure of 8 kPa. The non-linearity is about 4.2492% for the proposed sensor
for fabrication using surface micro-machining process.

describes the mathematical modelling and simulation of normal mode clamped
elliptical shaped capacitive pressure sensor. The study of various performance
parameters like maximum diaphragm deflection, capacitance variation, mechanical
sensitivity, capacitive sensitivity and non-linearity is also carried out for
operating pressure range of 0 kPa to 18 kPa. For circular capacitive pressure
sensor, the operating pressure range is modified according to physical
dimensions i.e. thickness and radius of diaphragm, separation gap between
plates and maximum deflection. For same overlapping area between plates
(10000*pi mm2), the comparison of elliptical shapes of different eccentricities
with circular shape diaphragm is carried out. The thickness of diaphragm is
taken as 2 um and separation gap is 1 um in all the designs which are used in
this work. In this comparative study, it is observed that elliptical shaped
capacitive pressure sensors have better linearity than circular diaphragm
