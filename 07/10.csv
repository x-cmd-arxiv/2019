systems is essential for the success of most quantum information processing
applications. The problem, however, quickly becomes non-trivial as the size of
the multipartition increases. With this motivation in mind, in this paper, we
put forth a detailed study of genuine multipartite correlations (GMCs) in the
Dicke model of superradiance. We compute all genuine $k$-partite correlations
for Dicke states with arbitrary excitations and use these results to
characterize the evolution of multipartite correlations during the superradiant
dynamics. Non-trivial effects in the way correlations in Dicke states are
distributed between the multiple parts are found, showing strong finite-size
effects. We also employ the concept of weaving to classify how multipartite
correlations scale with the number of particles in the system.

generalizability of the existing interfaces. To this end, we aim to create a
BCI system that decodes text directly from neural signals. We implement a
framework that initially isolates frequency bands in the input signal
encapsulating differential information regarding production of various phonemic
classes. These bands then form a feature set that feeds into an LSTM which
discerns at each time point probability distributions across all phonemes
uttered by a subject. Finally, these probabilities are fed into a particle
filtering algorithm which incorporates prior knowledge of the English language
to output text corresponding to the decoded word. Performance of this model on
data obtained from six patients shows encouragingly high levels of accuracy at
speeds and bit rates significantly higher than existing BCI communication

constraining the reconstructed word to be from a given bag-of-words, unlike
previous studies. The success of our proposed approach, offers promise for the
employment of a BCI interface by patients in unfettered, naturalistic

often aims to identify the process inputs that influence the process output's

from the actual process or its high-fidelity simulation model to identify the
influential inputs. In this paper, an alternate, novel approach is proposed
using a sparse polynomial chaos expansion-based model for a class of
input-output relationships represented as directed acyclic networks. The model
exploits the relationship structure by recursively relating a network node to
its direct predecessors to trace the output variance back to the inputs. It,
thereby, estimates the Sobol indices, which measure the influence of each input
on the output variance, accurately and efficiently. Theoretical analysis
establishes the validity of the model as the prediction of the network output
converges in probability to the true output under certain regularity
conditions. Empirical evaluation on two manufacturing processes shows that the
model estimates the Sobol indices accurately with far fewer observations than a
state-of-the-art Monte Carlo sampling method.

$y$ such that with probability $1-\rho$, $|y-f(x)| \le \epsilon$. However, with
probability $\rho$, the error $y-f(x)$ can be arbitrarily large.
  We study Fourier sparse functions over both the discrete cube $\{0,1\}^n$ and
the torus $[0,1)$ and for both these domains, we design efficient algorithms
which can tolerate any $\rho<1/2$ fraction of outliers. We note that the
analogous problem for low-degree polynomials has recently been studied in
several works~[AK03, GZ16, KKP17] and similar algorithmic guarantees are known

algorithm to tolerate $\rho =\Omega(1)$ fraction of outliers and further, that
this is not possible without such a granularity condition. Finally, while not

It states that
for any integer $k \ge 2$ and any finite $d$-dimensional point set $P \subseteq
\mathbb{R}^d$ of at least $(d + 1)(k - 1) + 1$ points, we can partition $P$
into $k$ subsets whose convex hulls have a non-empty intersection. The
computational problem of finding such a partition lies in the complexity class
$\mathrm{PPAD} \cap \mathrm{PLS}$, but no hardness results are known.
Tverberg's theorem also has a colorful variant: the points in $P$ have colors,
and under certain conditions, $P$ can be partitioned into colorful sets, i.e.,
sets in which each color appears exactly once such that the convex hulls of the
sets intersect.
  Recently, Adiprasito, Barany, and Mustafa [SODA 2019] proved a no-dimensional
version of Tverberg's theorem, in which the convex hulls of the sets in the
partition may intersect in an approximate fashion, relaxing the requirement on
the cardinality of $P$. The argument is constructive, but it does not result in
a polynomial-time algorithm.
  We present an alternative proof for a no-dimensional Tverberg theorem that
leads to an efficient algorithm to find the partition. More specifically, we
show an deterministic algorithm that finds for any set $P \subseteq
\mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points and any $k \in \{2, \dots, n\}$ in $O(nd \log k )$
time a partition of $P$ into $k$ subsets such that there is a ball of radius
$O\left(\frac{k}{\sqrt{n}}\textrm{diam}(P)\right)$ intersecting the convex hull
of each subset. A similar result holds also for the colorful version.
  To obtain our result, we generalize Sarkaria's tensor product constructions
[Israel Journal Math., 1992] that reduces the Tverberg problem to the Colorful
Caratheodory problem. By carefully choosing the vectors used in the tensor
products, we implement the reduction in an efficient manner.

mitigating or, even better, avoiding disruptions of tokamak plasmas. However,
before this can be done, disruptions must first be predicted with sufficient
warning time to actuate a response. The established field of survival analysis
provides a convenient statistical framework for time-to-event (i.e.
time-to-disruption) studies. This paper demonstrates the integration of an
existing disruption prediction machine learning algorithm with the Kaplan-Meier
estimator of survival probability. Specifically discussed are the implied
warning times from binary classification of disruption databases and the
interpretation of output signals from Random Forest algorithms trained and
tested on these databases. This survival analysis approach is applied to both
smooth and noisy test data to highlight important features of the survival and
hazard functions. In addition, this method is applied to three Alcator C-Mod
plasma discharges and compared to a threshold-based scheme for triggering
alarms. In one case, both techniques successfully predict the disruption;
although, in another, neither warns of the impending disruption with enough
time to mitigate. For the final discharge, the survival analysis approach could
avoid the false alarm triggered by the threshold method. Limitations of this
analysis and opportunities for future work are also presented.

(BSs) using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the limited on-board energy and
flight time. One potential solution to such problem, is to provide the UAV with
power supply through a tether that connects the UAV to the ground. In this
paper, we study the optimal placement of tethered UAVs (TUAVs) to minimize the
average path-loss between the TUAV and a receiver located on the ground. Given
that the tether has a maximum length, and the launching point of the TUAV (the
starting point of the tether) is placed on a rooftop, the TUAV is only allowed
to hover within a specific hovering region. Beside the maximum tether length,
this hovering region also depends on the heights of the buildings surrounding
the rooftop, which requires the inclination angle of the tether not to be below
a given minimum value, in order to avoid tangling and ensure safety. We first
formulate the optimization problem for such setup and provide some useful
insights on its solution. Next, we derive upper and lower bounds for the
optimal values of the tether length and inclination angle. We also propose a
suboptimal closed-form solution for the tether length and its inclination angle
that is based on maximizing the line-of-sight probability. Finally, we derive
the probability distribution of the minimum inclination angle of the tether
length. We show that its mean value varies depending on the environment from 10
degrees in suburban environments to 31 degrees in high rise urban environments.
Our numerical results show that the derived upper and lower bounds on the
optimal values of the tether length and inclination angle lead to tight
suboptimal values of the average path-loss that are only 0-3 dBs above the

instability and acceleration of CRs at shocks with a fluid approach in the

approach and its anisotropic nature is naturally captured. We introduce a shock
finder for the ramses code that automatically detects shock discontinuities in
the flow. Shocks are the loci for CR injection, and their efficiency of CR
acceleration is made dependent on the upstream magnetic obliquity according to
the diffuse shock acceleration mechanism. We show that the shock finder
accurately captures shock locations and estimates the shock Mach number for
several problems. The obliquity-dependent injection of CRs in the Sedov
solution leads to situations where the supernova bubble exhibits large polar
caps (homogeneous background magnetic field), or a patchy structure of the CR
distribution (inhomogeneous background magnetic field). Finally, we combine

As a prototype, we compute the Lifshitz interaction energy for a spherical
shell of water immersed in water vapor of infinite extent while enclosing a
spherical ball of ice inside the shell, such that two concentric spherical
interfaces are formed: one between solid ice and liquid water and the other
between liquid water and gaseous vapor. We evaluate the Lifshitz interaction
energy for the above configuration at the triple point of water when the solid,
liquid, and gaseous states of water coexist, and, thus, extend the analysis of
Elbaum and Schick in Phys. Rev. Lett. 66 (1991) 1713 to spherical
configurations. We find that, when the Lifshitz energy contributes dominantly
to the total energy of this system, which is often the case when electrostatic
interactions are absent, a drop of water surrounded by vapor of infinite extent
is not stable at the triple point. This instability, that is a manifestation of
the quantum fluctuations in the medium, will promote formation of ice in water,
which will then grow in size indefinitely. This is a consequence of the finding
here that the Lifshitz energy is minimized for large (micrometer size) radius
of the ice ball and small (nanometer size) thickness of the water shell
surrounding the ice. These results might be relevant to the formation of hail
in thunderclouds. These results are tentative in that the self-energies are
omitted; surface tension and nucleation energy are not considered.

Its relevant characteristics is the combination of the transition metal

applying strain on the heterostructure, this system provides a tunable

stellar clusters are in a state of expansion, with velocities of the order of
~0.5 km/s. Traditionally, expanding young clusters have been pictured as
entities that became unbound due to the lack of gravitational binding once the
gas from the parental cloud that formed the cluster has been expelled by the
stellar radiation of the massive stars in the cluster. In the present
contribution, we used radiation-magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of
molecular cloud formation and evolution to understand how stellar clusters form
and disperse. We found that the ionising feedback from the newborn massive
stars expels the gas from the collapse centre, flipping-up the gravitational
potential as a consequence of the mass removal from the inside-out. Since
neither the parental clouds nor the formed shells are distributed symmetrically
around the HII region, net forces pulling out the stars are present,
accelerating them towards the edges of the cavity. We call this mechanism
``gravitational feedback"", in which the gravity from the expelled gas appears
to be the crucial mechanism producing unbound clusters that expand away from
their formation centre in an accelerated way in young stellar clusters. This
mechanism naturally explains the ""Hubble flow-like"" expansion observed in
several young clusters.

The presence of long-wavelength $\delta_{bc}$ perturbations in our simulations
is mimicked by modifying the ratios of the cosmic densities of baryons
$\Omega_b$ and CDM $\Omega_c$, at fixed total matter density $\Omega_m$. We
measure the corresponding galaxy bias parameter $b_{\delta}^{bc}$ as the
response of galaxy abundances to $\delta_{bc}$. When selecting by total host
halo mass, $b_{\delta}^{bc}$ is negative and it decreases with mass and
redshift. Stellar-mass selected simulated galaxies show a weaker or even the
opposite trend because of the competing effects of $\delta_{bc}$ on the halo
mass function and stellar-to-halo-mass relations. We show that simple modeling
of the latter two effects describes $b_{\delta}^{bc}$ for stellar-mass-selected
objects well. We find $b_{\delta}^{bc} =0.6$ for $M_* = 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}/h$

was already in place at z~1.4. While the [Mg/Fe]-mass relation at z~1.4 is
consistent with the z<0.7 relation, [Fe/H] at z~1.4 is ~0.2 dex lower than at
z<0.7. With a [Mg/Fe] of 0.44(+0.08,-0.07) the most massive galaxy may be more
alpha-enhanced than similar-mass galaxies at lower redshift, but the offset is
less significant than the [Mg/Fe] of 0.6 previously found for a massive galaxy
at z=2.1. Nonetheless, these results combined may suggest that [Mg/Fe] in the
most massive galaxies decreases over time, possibly by accreting low-mass, less
alpha-enhanced galaxies. A larger galaxy sample is needed to confirm this
scenario. Finally, the abundance ratios indicate short star-formation
timescales of 0.2-1.0 Gyr.

polynomials. The singularity set of a noncommutative polynomial
$f=f(x_1,\dots,x_g)$ is $Z(f)=(Z_n(f))_n$, where $Z_n(f)=\{X \in M_n^g: \det
f(X) = 0\}.$ The first main theorem of this article shows that the irreducible
factors of $f$ are in a natural bijective correspondence with irreducible
components of $Z_n(f)$ for every sufficiently large $n$.
  With each polynomial $h$ in $x$ and $x^*$ one also associates its real
singularity set $Z^{re}(h)=\{X: \det h(X,X^*)=0\}$. A polynomial $f$ which
depends on $x$ alone (no $x^*$ variables) will be called analytic. The main
Nullstellensatz proved here is as follows: for analytic $f$ but for $h$
dependent on possibly both $x$ and $x^*$, the containment $Z(f) \subseteq
Z^{re}(h)$ is equivalent to each factor of $f$ being ""stably associated"" to a
factor of $h$ or of $h^*$.
  For perspective, classical Hilbert type Nullstellens\""atze typically apply
only to analytic polynomials $f,h $, while real Nullstellens\""atze typically
require adjusting the functions by sums of squares of polynomials (sos). Since
the above ""algebraic certificate"" does not involve a sos, it seems justified to
think of this as the natural determinantal Hilbert Nullstellensatz. An earlier
paper of the authors (Adv. Math. 331 (2018) 589-626) obtained such a theorem
for special classes of analytic polynomials $f$ and $h$. This paper requires
few hypotheses and hopefully brings this type of Nullstellensatz to near final
form.
  Finally, the paper gives a Nullstellensatz for zeros $V(f)=\{X: f(X,X^*)=0\}$
of a hermitian polynomial $f$, leading to a strong Positivstellensatz for
quadratic free semialgebraic sets by the use of a slack variable.

that receive velocity kicks at the origin of their host star cluster potential.
We now focus on BHs in rotating clusters that receive a range of kick
velocities in different directions with respect to the rotation axis. We
perform N-body simulations to calculate the trajectories of the kicked BHs and
develop an analytic framework to study their motion as a function of the host
cluster and the kick itself. Our simulations indicate that for a BH that is
kicked outside of the cluster's core, as its orbit decays in a rotating cluster
the BH will quickly gain angular momentum as it interacts with stars with high
rotational frequencies. Once the BH decays to the point where its orbital
frequency equals that of local stars, its orbit will be circular and dynamical
friction becomes ineffective since local stars will have low relative
velocities. After circularization, the BH's orbit decays on a longer timescale
than if the host cluster was not rotating. Hence BHs in rotating clusters will
have longer orbital decay times. The timescale for orbit circularization
depends strongly on the cluster's rotation rate and the initial kick velocity,
with kicked BHs in slowly rotating clusters being able to decay into the core
before circularization occurs. The implication of the circularization phase is
that the probability of a BH undergoing a tidal capture event increases,
possibly aiding in the formation of binaries and high-mass BHs.

$\textrm{tr} (\rho_A-\sigma_A)^n$ and taking the limit $n\to1$ of the traces of
the even powers. We focus here on the case of a subsystem consisting of a
single interval of length $\ell$ embedded in the low lying eigenstates of a
one-dimensional critical system of length $L$, a situation that can be studied
exploiting the path integral form of the reduced density matrices of
two-dimensional conformal field theories. The trace distance turns out to be a
scale invariant universal function of $\ell/L$. Here we complete our previous
work by providing detailed derivations of all results and further new formulas
for the distances between several low-lying states in two-dimensional free
massless compact boson and fermion theories. Remarkably, for one special case
in the bosonic theory and for another in the fermionic one, we obtain the exact
trace distance, as well as the Schatten $n$-distance, for an interval of
arbitrary length, while in generic case we have a general form for the first
term in the expansion in powers of $\ell/L$. The analytical predictions in
conformal field theories are tested against exact numerical calculations in XX

weakly with large-scale overdensity and Cosmic Web class. The latter two
quantities correlate with each other, but are not entirely degenerate.

using the state-of-the-art direct imaging pipeline PynPoint and combined with
RV data from HARPS, Keck/HIRES, and CORALIE. A Monte Carlo approach was used to
assess the completeness in the companion mass/semi-major axis parameter space
from the combination of the HCI and RV data sets. We find that the HCI data add
significant information to the RV constraints, increasing the completeness for
certain companions masses/semi-major axes by up to 68 - 99% for 4 of the 6

improvements are strongest for intermediate semi-major axes (15 - 40 AU),
corresponding to the semi-major axes of the ice giants in our own solar system.
The HCI mass limits reach 5 - 20 $M_{\textrm{Jup}}$ in the background-limited
regime, depending on the age of the star. Through the combination of HCI and RV
data, we find that stringent constraints can be placed on the possible
substellar companions in these systems. Applying these methods systematically

to magnetic reconnection. To understand UV bursts, we study how motions of
magnetic elements at the surface can drive the self-consistent formation of a
current sheet resulting in plasmoid-mediated reconnection. In particular, we
want to study the role of the height of the reconnection in the atmosphere. We
conducted numerical experiments solving the 2D MHD equations from the solar
surface to the upper atmosphere. Motivated by observations, we drove a small
magnetic patch embedded in a larger system of magnetic field of opposite
polarity. This configuration creates an X-type neutral point in the initial
potential field. The models are characterized by the plasma-beta at the height
of this X point. The driving at the surface stretches the X-point into a
current sheet, where plasmoids appear, and a bi-directional jet forms. This is
consistent with what is expected for UV bursts or explosive events, and we
provide a self-consistent model of the formation of the reconnection region in
such events. The gravitational stratification gives an explanation for why
explosive events are restricted to a temperature range around a few 0.1 MK, and
the presence of plasmoids in the reconnection process provides an understanding
of the observed variability during the transient events on a timescale of
minutes. Our numerical experiments provide a comprehensive understanding of UV
bursts and explosive events, in particular of how the atmospheric response
changes if the reconnection happens at different plasma-beta, that is, at
different heights in the atmosphere. This analysis also gives new insight into
how UV bursts might be related to the photospheric Ellerman bombs.

impact of CGM diversity on observational studies. Although the Auriga haloes
are selected to populate a narrow range in halo mass, our work demonstrates
that the CGM of L* galaxies is extremely diverse: column densities of commonly
observed species span ~3-4 dex and their covering fractions range from ~5 to 90
per cent. Despite this diversity, we identify the following correlations: 1)
the covering fractions (CF) of hydrogen and metals of the Auriga haloes
positively correlate with stellar mass, 2) the CF of H I, C IV, and Si II
anticorrelate with active galactic nucleus luminosity due to ionization
effects, and 3) the CF of H I, C IV, and Si II positively correlate with galaxy
disc fraction due to outflows populating the CGM with cool and dense gas. The

triangles, the 21cm bispectra features a change of sign from negative to
positive values, with ionized and neutral regions representing below-average
and above-average concentrations contributing negatively and positively,
respectively. The position of the change of sign provides a tracer of the size
distribution of the ionized and neutral regions, and allows us to identify
three major regimes that the 21cm bispectrum undergoes during reionization. In
particular the regime during the early stages of reionization, where the 21cm
bispectrum tracks the peak of the size distribution of the ionized regions,
provides exciting prospects for pinning down reionization with the forthcoming
Square Kilometre Array.

both in the bulk and on the surface, hosting chiral nodes which are sinks and
sources of Berry curvature. Weyl semimetals have been predicted, and recently
measured, to exhibit large nonlinear optical responses. This discovery, along
with their high mobilities, makes Weyl semimetals relevant to a broad spectrum
of applications in optoelectronic, nanophotonic and quantum optical devices.
While there is growing interest in understanding and characterizing the linear
and nonlinear behavior of Weyl semimetals, an ab initio calculation of the
linear optical and optoelectronic responses at finite temperature remains
largely unexplored. Here, we specifically address the temperature dependence of
the linear optical response in type-I Weyl semimetals TaAs and NbAs. We
evaluate from first principles the scattering lifetimes due to electron-phonon
and electron-electron interaction and incorporate these lifetimes in evaluating
an experimentally relevant frequency-, polarization- and temperature-dependent
complex dielectric function for each semimetal. From these calculations we
present linear optical conductivity predictions which agree well where
experiment exists (for TaAs) and guide the way for future measurements of
type-I Weyl semimetals. Importantly, we also examine the optical conductivity's
dependence on the chemical potential, a crucial physical parameter which can be
controlled experimentally and can elucidate the role of the Weyl nodes in
optoelectronic response. Through this work, we present design principles for
Weyl optoelectronic devices that use photogenerated carriers in type-I Weyl

spectral theory of signed graphs elegantly generalizes the spectral theories of
unsigned graphs. On the other hand, unsigned graphs do not disappear
completely, since their role can be taken by the special case of balanced
signed graphs.
  Therefore, spectral problems defined and studied for unsigned graphs can be

demonstrate that layers closer to input retain more phonetic information, while
following layers exhibit greater invariance to domain shift. Moreover, while

results show that this technology is able to serve the base load of the system,
reducing the required installed capacity of other resources, as well as
decreasing the storage requirements and excess electricity production. When the

categorical reparametrisation for hybrid system identification. This results in
a network comprising a classification layer that is followed by a regression
layer. We use switching density networks to predict the parameters of hybrid
control laws, which are toggled by a switching layer to produce different
controller outputs, when conditioned on an input state. This work shows how
switching density networks can be used for hybrid system identification in a
variety of tasks, successfully identifying the key joint angle goals that make
up manipulation tasks, while simultaneously learning image-based goal
classifiers and regression networks that predict joint angles from images. We
also show that they can cluster the phase space of an inverted pendulum,
identifying the balance, spin and pump controllers required to solve this task.
Switching density networks can be difficult to train, but we introduce a cross

attention in recent years with images' growing domination on the Internet and
mobile applications. However, with the booming trend of convolutional neural
networks, image steganography is facing a more significant challenge from
neural-network-automated tasks. To improve the security of image steganography
and minimize task result distortion, models must maintain the feature maps
generated by task-specific networks being irrelative to any hidden information
embedded in the carrier. This paper introduces a binary attention mechanism
into image steganography to help alleviate the security issue, and in the
meanwhile, increase embedding payload capacity. The experimental results show
that our method has the advantage of high payload capacity with little feature
map distortion and still resist detection by state-of-the-art image
steganalysis algorithms.

magnetoresistance (TAMR) of up to 60% when adsorbed on a magnetic

hybridization of 6p orbitals with 3d states of the magnetic layer. Using
density functional theory, we have explored the TAMR effect of Pb and Bi
adatoms and dimers adsorbed on a Mn monolayer on W(110). This surface exhibits
a noncollinear cycloidal spin spiral ground state with an angle of 173$^\circ$
between neighboring spins which allows to rotate the spin quantization axis of
an adatom or dimer quasi-continuously and is ideally suited to explore the
angular dependence of TAMR using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find
that the induced magnetic moments of Pb and Bi adatoms and dimers are small,
however, the spin-polarization of the local density of states (LDOS) is still
very large. The TAMR obtained from the anisotropy of the vacuum LDOS is up to
50-60 % for adatoms. For dimers the TAMR depends sensitively on the dimer
orientation with respect to the crystallographic directions of the surface due
to the formation of bonds between the adatoms with the Mn surface atoms and the
symmetry of the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing. Dimers oriented along the
spin spiral direction of the Mn monolayer display the largest TAMR of 60 %
which is due to hybrid 6p-3d states of the dimers and the Mn layer

as their orbital motion: their spin is prograde. Theoretical studies to explain
the direction as well as the magnitude of the spin vector have had mixed
success. When the accreting building blocks are $\sim$ km-size planetesimals --
as predicted by the classical model -- the accretion process is so symmetric
that it cancels out prograde with retrograde spin contributions, rendering the
net spin minute. For this reason, the currently-favored model for the origin of
planetary rotation is the giant impact model, in which a single collision
suffices to deliver a spin, which magnitude is close to the breakup rotation
rate. However, the giant impact model does not naturally explain the preference
for prograde spin. Similarly, an increasing number of spin-vector measurement
of asteroids also shows that the spin vector of large (primordial) asteroids is
not isotropic. Here, we re-assess the viability of smaller particles to bestow
planetary bodies with a net spin, focusing on the pebble accretion model in
which gas drag and gravity join forces to accrete small particles at a large
cross section. Similar to the classical calculation for planetesimals, we
integrate the pebble equation of motion and measure the angular momentum
transfer at impact. We consider a variety of disk conditions and pebble
properties and conduct our calculations in the limits of 2D (planar) and 3D
(homogeneous) pebble distributions. We find that in certain regions of the
parameter space the angular momentum transfer is significant, much larger than
with planetesimals and on par with or exceeding the current spin of planetary
bodies.

queried about a subset $S\subseteq [n]$ of vertices the independent set oracle
answers whether $S$ is an independent set in $G$ or not. Our first main result
is an algorithm that computes a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation of the number of
edges $m$ of the graph using $\min(\sqrt{m},n /

improves the upper bound of $\min(\sqrt{m},n^2/m)\cdot\textrm{poly}(\log

that ${\min(\sqrt{m},n/\sqrt{m}))/\textrm{polylog}(n)}$ independent set queries

exciting new direction of study. In a promise CSP, each constraint comes in two
forms: ""strict"" and ""weak,"" and in the associated decision problem one must
distinguish between being able to satisfy all the strict constraints versus not
being able to satisfy all the weak constraints. The most commonly cited example
of a promise CSP is the approximate graph coloring problem--which has recently
seen exciting progress [BKO19, WZ20] benefiting from a systematic algebraic
approach to promise CSPs based on ""polymorphisms,"" operations that map tuples
in the strict form of each constraint to tuples in the corresponding weak form.
  In this work, we present a simple algorithm which in polynomial time solves
the decision problem for all promise CSPs that admit infinitely many symmetric
polymorphisms, which are invariant under arbitrary coordinate permutations.
This generalizes previous work of the first two authors [BG19]. We also extend
this algorithm to a more general class of block-symmetric polymorphisms. As a
corollary, this single algorithm solves all polynomial-time tractable Boolean
CSPs simultaneously. These results give a new perspective on Schaefer's classic
dichotomy theorem and shed further light on how symmetries of polymorphisms
enable algorithms. Finally, we show that block symmetric polymorphisms are not
only sufficient but also necessary for this algorithm to work, thus
establishing its precise power

broad generalization of many graph classes for which we can compute the
diameter in truly subquadratic-time. In particular for any fixed $H$, the class
of $H$-minor free graphs has distance VC-dimension at most $|V(H)|-1$. Our
first main result is that on graphs of distance VC-dimension at most $d$, for
any fixed $k$ we can either compute the diameter or conclude that it is larger
than $k$ in time $\tilde{\cal O}(k\cdot mn^{1-\varepsilon_d})$, where
$\varepsilon_d \in (0;1)$ only depends on $d$. Then as a byproduct of our
approach, we get the first truly subquadratic-time algorithm for constant
diameter computation on all the nowhere dense graph classes. Finally, we show
how to remove the dependency on $k$ for any graph class that excludes a fixed
graph $H$ as a minor. More generally, our techniques apply to any graph with
constant distance VC-dimension and polynomial expansion. As a result for all
such graphs one obtains a truly subquadratic-time algorithm for computing their
diameter. Our approach is based on the work of Chazelle and Welzl who proved
the existence of spanning paths with strongly sublinear stabbing number for
every hypergraph of constant VC-dimension. We show how to compute such paths
efficiently by combining the best known approximation algorithms for the
stabbing number problem with a clever use of $\varepsilon$-nets, region

(SFAs) above this limit, a slope and a scatter of $\approx1$ and $\approx0.27$
dex are determined. The retired galaxies/areas strongly segregate from their
respective SFMS's, by $\sim -1.5$ dex on average. We explore how the
global/local SFMS's depend on galaxy morphology, finding that for star-forming
galaxies and SFAs, there is a trend to lower values of star-formation activity
with earlier morphological types, which is more pronounced for the local SFMS.
The morphology not only affects the global SFR due to the diminish of SFAs with
earlier types, but also affects the local SF process. Our results suggest that
the local SF at all radii is established by some universal mechanism partially
modulated by morphology. Morphology seems to be connected to the slow aging and
sharp decline of the SF process, and on its own it may depend on other
properties as the environment.

We obtain this surprising property by having agents take turns when updating

agents' strategies are bounded and cycle when both are using the alternating

knowledge extraction over trajectories, unlike in BO; 2) time-adaptively
balancing exploration/exploitation and using an efficient local penalization
approach to account for potential interactions among different robots' planned
samples; and 3) presenting an asynchronous implementation of the algorithm.

complexity as the setting becomes more general, all our mechanisms share the

problem in which there are $k$ types of nodes on one side (the ads), and an
ordered set of nodes on the other side (the slots). The edge weight of an ad
$i$ of type $\theta$ to slot $j$ is $v_i\cdot \alpha^{\theta}_j$ where $v_i$ is
an advertiser-specific value and each ad type $\theta$ has a discount curve
$\alpha^{(\theta)}_{1} \ge \alpha^{(\theta)}_{2} \ge ... \ge 0$ over the slots
that is common for ads of type $\theta$. We present two contributions for this
problem: 1) we give an algorithm that finds the maximum weight matching that
runs in $O(n^2(k + \log n))$ time for $n$ slots and $n$ ads of each type---cf.
$O(kn^3)$ when using the Hungarian algorithm---, and 2) we show to do VCG
pricing in asymptotically the same time, namely $O(n^2(k + \log n))$, and apply
reserve prices in $O(n^3(k + \log n))$.
  The Ad Types Problem (with gap rules) includes a matrix $G$ such that after
we show an ad of type $\theta_i$, the next $G_{ij}$ slots cannot show an ad of
type $\theta_j$. We show that the problem is hard to approximate within $k^{1-
\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ (even without discount curves) by reduction
from Maximum Independent Set. On the positive side, we show a Dynamic Program
formulation that solves the problem (including discount curves) optimally and
runs in $O(k\cdot n^{2k + 1})$ time.

and all $n$-length subwords of a text in the streaming model. In the streaming
setting, only the Hamming distance ($L_0$) has been studied. It is known that
computing the exact Hamming distance between a pattern and a streaming text
requires $\Omega(n)$ space (folklore). Therefore, to develop sublinear-space
solutions, one must relax their requirements. One possibility to do so is to
compute only the distances bounded by a threshold $k$, see~[SODA'19, Clifford,
Kociumaka, Porat] and references therein. The motivation for this variant of
this problem is that we are interested in subwords of the text that are similar
to the pattern, i.e. in subwords such that the distance between them and the
pattern is relatively small. On the other hand, the main application of the
streaming setting is processing large-scale data, such as biological data.
Recent advances in hardware technology allow generating such data at a very
high speed, but unfortunately, the produced data may contain about 10\% of
noise~[Biol. Direct.'07, Klebanov and Yakovlev]. To analyse such data, it is
not sufficient to consider small distances only. A possible workaround for this
issue is the $(1\pm\varepsilon)$-approximation. This line of research was
initiated in [ICALP'16, Clifford and Starikovskaya] who gave a
$(1\pm\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with
space~$\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-5}\sqrt{n})$. In this work, we show a suite of
new streaming algorithms for computing the Hamming, $L_1$, $L_2$ and general
$L_p$ ($0 < p < 2$) distances between the pattern and the text. Our results
significantly extend over the previous result in this setting. In particular,
for the Hamming distance and for the $L_p$ distance when $0 < p \le 1$ we show
a streaming algorithm that uses $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}\sqrt{n})$ space for
polynomial-size alphabets.

  Computer Science and Software Engineering",,,,"cs.LO cs.AI cs.SC math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last few decades, many distinct lines of research aimed at
automating mathematics have been developed, including computer algebra systems
(CASs) for mathematical modelling, automated theorem provers for first-order
logic, SAT/SMT solvers aimed at program verification, and higher-order proof
assistants for checking mathematical proofs. More recently, some of these lines
of research have started to converge in complementary ways. One success story
is the combination of SAT solvers and CASs (SAT+CAS) aimed at resolving
mathematical conjectures.
  Many conjectures in pure and applied mathematics are not amenable to
traditional proof methods. Instead, they are best addressed via computational
methods that involve very large combinatorial search spaces. SAT solvers are
powerful methods to search through such large combinatorial
spaces---consequently, many problems from a variety of mathematical domains
have been reduced to SAT in an attempt to resolve them. However, solvers
traditionally lack deep repositories of mathematical domain knowledge that can
be crucial to pruning such large search spaces. By contrast, CASs are deep
repositories of mathematical knowledge but lack efficient general search
capabilities. By combining the search power of SAT with the deep mathematical
knowledge in CASs we can solve many problems in mathematics that no other known
methods seem capable of solving.
  We demonstrate the success of the SAT+CAS paradigm by highlighting many
conjectures that have been disproven, verified, or partially verified using our
tool MathCheck. These successes indicate that the paradigm is positioned to
become a standard method for solving problems requiring both a significant
amount of search and deep mathematical reasoning. For example, the SAT+CAS
paradigm has recently been used by Heule, Kauers, and Seidl to find many new
algorithms for $3\times3$ matrix multiplication.

regional activation and long-range functional connectivity in the different
brain states visited during the natural wake-sleep cycle. Our model combines
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, in vivo estimates of
structural connectivity, and anatomically-informed priors that constrain the
independent variation of regional activation. As expected, priors based on
functionally coherent networks resulted in the best fit between empirical and
simulated brain activity. We show that sleep progressively divided the cortex
into regions presenting opposite dynamical behavior: frontoparietal regions
approached a bifurcation towards local oscillatory dynamics, while sensorimotor
regions presented stable dynamics governed by noise. In agreement with human
electrophysiological experiments, sleep onset induced subcortical deactivation
and uncoupling, which was subsequently reversed for deeper stages. Finally, we
introduced external forcing of variable intensity to simulate external
perturbations, and identifiedthe key regionsespecially relevant for the
recovery of wakefulness from deep sleep. Our model represents sleep as a state
where long-range decoupling and regional deactivation coexist with the latent
capacity for a rapid transition towards wakefulness. The mechanistic insights
provided by our simulations allow the in silico parametric exploration of such
transitions in terms of external perturbations, with potential applications for
the control of physiological and pathological brain states.

problem (SC). In PSC the input consists of an integer $k$ and a set system
$(U,S)$ where $U$ is a finite set, and $S \subseteq 2^U$ is a collection of
subsets of $U$. The goal is to find a subcollection $S' \subseteq S$ of
smallest cardinality such that sets in $S'$ cover at least $k$ elements of $U$;
that is $|\cup_{A \in S'} A| \ge k$. SC is a special case of PSC when $k =
|U|$. In the weighted version each set $X \in S$ has a non-negative weight
$w(X)$ and the goal is to find a minimum weight subcollection to cover $k$
elements. Approximation algorithms for SC have been adapted to obtain
comparable algorithms for PSC in various interesting cases. In recent work
Inamdar and Varadarajan, motivated by geometric set systems, obtained a simple
and elegant approach to reduce PSC to SC via the natural LP relaxation. They
showed that if a deletion-closed family of SC admits a $\beta$-approximation
via the natural LP relaxation, then one can obtain a $2(\beta +
1)$-approximation for PSC on the same family. In a subsequent paper, they also
considered a generalization of PSC that has multiple partial covering
constraints which is partly inspired by and generalizes previous work of Bera
et al on the Vertex Cover problem. Our main goal in this paper is to
demonstrate some useful connections between the results in previous work and
submodularity. This allows us to simplify, and in some cases improve their

applications of plasmonics. The conventional approach to circumvent this
limitation has been to search for new materials with more favorable dielectric
properties (e.g., reduced loss), or to incorporate gain media to overcome the
inherent loss. In this study, however, we turn our attention to the source and
show that, by imposing temporal decay on the excitation, SPP modes with
simultaneous complex frequencies and complex wave vectors can be excited with
enhanced resolution and propagation length. Therefore, to understand the
underlying physics of these phenomena and, in turn, to be able to tune them for
specific applications, we propose a framework of pseudo-monochromatic modes
that are generated by introducing exponential decays into otherwise
monochromatic sources. Within this framework, the dispersion relation of
complex SPPs is re-evaluated and cast to be a surface rather than a curve,
depicting all possible $\omega-k$ pairs (both complex in general) that are
supported by the given geometry. Since the improvement in resolution and
propagation length due to the introduction of temporal decay to the excitation
is rather counter-intuitive (i.e., adding temporal loss improves the
propagation length), the dispersion-based theoretical predictions have been
validated via the FDTD simulations of Maxwell's equations in the same geometry
without any a priori assumptions on the frequency or the wave vector. Moreover,
improvement in resolution with the temporal decay has been demonstrated in a
plasmonic superlens structure to further validate the predictions.

In his long and distinguished career he has made seminal contributions to many
areas of heavy ion theory, including early papers on quarkonium phenomenology
in fixed-target heavy ion experiments. Theoretical and experimental studies of
the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ states have evolved considerably in the past
decades, and I describe a recent generalization of non-relativistic Quantum
Chromodynamics to include interactions in a generic nuclear medium. NRQCD with
Glauber gluons aims to provide a universal microscopic description of the
interaction of heavy quarkonia in a range of phases that include cold nuclear
matter, dense hadron gas, and quark-gluon plasma. Such effective field theory
is an important step toward understanding the common trends in proton-nucleus
and nucleus-nucleus data on quarkonium suppression.

trajectories of moving objects in Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the distance
between two curves is measured using the discrete Fr\'echet distance. We design
data structures in an \emph{asymmetric} setting where the input is a curve (or
a set of $n$ curves) each of complexity $m$ and the queries are with curves of
complexity $k\ll m$. We show that there exist approximate data structures that
are independent of the input size $N = d \cdot n \cdot m$ and we study how to
maintain them dynamically if the input is given in the stream.
  Concretely, we study two types of data structures: (i) distance oracles,
where the task is to store a compressed version of the input curve, which can
be used to answer queries for the distance of a query curve to the input curve,
and (ii) nearest-neighbor data structures, where the task is to preprocess a
set of input curves to answer queries for the input curve closest to the query
curve. In both cases we are interested in approximation. For curves embedded in
Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^d$ with constant $d$, our distance oracle uses space in
$\mathcal{O}((k \log(\epsilon^{-1}) \epsilon^{-d})^k)$ ($\epsilon$ is the
precision parameter). The oracle performs $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate queries in
time in $\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ and is deterministic. We show how to maintain this
distance oracle in the stream using polylogarithmic additional memory. In the
stream, we can dynamically answer distance queries to the portion of the stream
seen so far in $\mathcal{O}(k^4 \log^2 m)$ time. We apply our techniques to the
second problem, approximate near neighbor (ANN) data structures, and achieve an
exponential improvement in the dependency on the complexity of the input curves
compared to the state of the art.

curves for a large fraction of the sky, such that many new variable stars are
being discovered. However, some stars have periodic variability with periods of
order minutes and require high-cadence photometry to probe the physical
mechanisms responsible. A cadence of less than a minute is often required to
remove Nyquist ambiguities and confirm rapid variability which forces observers
to obtain high-cadence ground-based photometry. Aims. We aim to provide a
modern software package to reduce ground-based photometric time series data and
deliver optimised (differential) light curves. To produce high-quality light
curves, which maximise the amplitude signal-to-noise ratio of short-period
variability in a Fourier spectrum, we require adaptive elliptical aperture
photometry as this represents a significant advantage compared to aperture
photometry using circular apertures of fixed radii. Methods. The methodology of
our code and its advantages are demonstrated using high-cadence ground-based
photometry from the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) of a
confirmed rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star. Furthermore, we employ our
software package to search for rapid oscillations in three candidate roAp
stars. Results. We demonstrate that our pipeline represents a significant
improvement in the quality of light curves, and we make it available to the
community for use with different instruments and observatories. We search for
and demonstrate the lack of high-frequency roAp pulsations to a limit of
$\sim$1 mmag using B data in the three Ap stars HD 158596, HD 166542 and HD
181810. Conclusions. We demonstrate the significant improvement in the
extraction of short-period variability caused by high-frequency pulsation
modes, and discuss the implication of null detections in three Ap stars.

frequency band a key component of the next-generation wireless networks. While
mmWave spectrum offers extremely large transmission bandwidths to accommodate
ever-increasing data rates, unique characteristics of this new spectrum need
special consideration to achieve the promised network throughput. In this work,
we consider the off-grid problem for mmWave communications, which has a
significant impact on basic network functionalities involving beam steering and
tracking. The off-grid effect naturally appears in compressed sensing (CS)
techniques adopting a discretization approach for representing the angular
domain. This approach yields a finite set of discrete angle points, which are
an approximation to the continuous angular space, and hence degrade the
accuracy of related parameter estimation. In order to cope with the off-grid
effect, we present a novel parameter-perturbation framework to efficiently
estimate the channel and the covariance for mmWave networks. The proposed
algorithms employ a smart perturbation mechanism in conjunction with a
low-complexity greedy framework of simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit
(SOMP), and jointly solve for the off-grid parameters and weights. Numerical
results show a significant performance improvement through our novel framework
as a result of handling the off-grid effects, which is totally ignored in the

Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) is chosen as the performance metric, which is then
maximized during classifier selection and hyper-parameter tuning. The
robustness of the two selected type of classifiers, C-SVM, and \u{psion}-SVM,

completely integrable systems on a complex semisimple Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{g}$. Their theory associates a maximal Poisson-commutative
subalgebra of $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]$ to each regular element
$a\in\mathfrak{g}$, and one can assemble free generators of this subalgebra
into a moment map $F_a:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^b$.
  We examine the structure of fibres in Mishchenko--Fomenko systems, building
on the foundation laid by Bolsinov, Charbonnel--Moreau, Moreau, and others.
This includes proving that the critical values of $F_a$ have codimension $1$ or
$2$ in $\mathbb{C}^b$, and that each codimension is achievable in examples. Our
results on singularities make use of a subalgebra
$\mathfrak{b}^a\subseteq\mathfrak{g}$, defined to be the intersection of all
Borel subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$ containing $a$. In the case of a
non-nilpotent $a\in\mathfrak{g}_{\text{reg}}$ and an element
$x\in\mathfrak{b}^a$, we prove the following:
$x+[\mathfrak{b}^a,\mathfrak{b}^a]$ lies in the singular locus of
$F_a^{-1}(F_a(x))$, and the fibres through points in $\mathfrak{b}^a$ form a
$\mathrm{rank}(\mathfrak{g})$-dimensional family of singular fibres. We next
consider the irreducible components of our fibres, giving a systematic way to
construct many components via Mishchenko--Fomenko systems on Levi subalgebras
$\mathfrak{l}\subseteq\mathfrak{g}$. In addition, we obtain concrete results on
irreducible components that do not arise from the aforementioned construction.
Our final main result is a recursive formula for the number of irreducible
components in $F_a^{-1}(0)$, and it generalizes a result of Charbonnel--Moreau.
Illustrative examples are included at the end of this paper.

accurate electronic structure approaches for its favorable cubic scaling with
system size, which often makes FN-DMC the only computationally affordable
high-quality method in large condensed phase systems with more than 100 atoms.
In such systems FN-DMC deploys pseudopotentials to substantially improve
efficiency. In order to deal with non-local terms of pseudopotentials, the
FN-DMC algorithm must use an additional approximation, leading to the so-called
localization error. However, the two available approximations, the locality
approximation (LA) and the T-move approximation (TM), have certain
disadvantages and can make DMC calculations difficult to reproduce. Here we
introduce a third approach, called the determinant localization approximation
(DLA). DLA eliminates reproducibility issues and systematically provides good
quality results and stable simulations that are slightly more efficient than LA
and TM. When calculating energy differences -- such as interaction and
ionization energies -- DLA is also more accurate than the LA and TM approaches.
We believe that DLA paves the way to the automization of FN-DMC and its much
easier application in large systems.

conclude that only species-metabolite models have the necessary complexity to

on AdS$_3\times \mathcal{N}$ produces a change in the winding number of one of
the incoming (or outgoing) states, making it possible to compute amplitudes of
processes in which winding number in AdS$_3$ is not conserved. The insertion of
such operator, however, might seem artificial from the worldsheet theory
perspective, as it appears as an unintegrated vertex operator of conformal
dimension zero that does not represent any normalizable state. Here, we show
that the spectral flow operator naturally emerges in the Liouville field theory
description of the WZW correlation functions once it is combined with a series
of duality relations among conformal integrals. By considering multiple
insertions of spectral flow operators, we study the dependence on the moduli
for arbitrary number of them, and we show explicitly that the amplitude does
not depend on the specific locations of the accessory insertions in the
worldsheet, as required by consistency. This generalizes previous computations
in which particular cases were considered. This can also be thought of as an
alternative proof of the WZW-Liouville correspondence in the case of maximally
winding violating correlators.

oil droplets rising through a two-layer density stratification. These
experiments confirm the significant slowdown observed in past literature of
settling and rising particles and droplets in stratification, and are the first
experiments to study single liquid droplets as opposed to solid particles. By
tracking the motion of the droplets as they rise through a stratified fluid, we
identify two timescales which quantitatively describe this slowdown: an
entrainment timescale, and a retention timescale. The entrainment timescale is
a measure of the time that a droplet spends below its upper-layer terminal
velocity and relates to the length of time over which the droplet's rise is
affected by entrained dense fluid. The retention time is a measure of the time
that the droplet is delayed from reaching an upper threshold far from the
density transition. Both timescales are found to depend on the Froude and
Reynolds numbers of the system, Fr $=U_u/(Nd)$ and Re $=\rho_u U_u d/\nu$. We
find that both timescales are only significantly large for Fr $\lesssim1$,
indicating that trapping dynamics in a relatively sharp stratification arise
from a balance between drop inertia and buoyancy. Finally, we present a
theoretical formulation for the drag enhancement $\Gamma$, the ratio between
the maximum stratification force and the corresponding drag force on the
droplet, based on a simple force balance at the point of the velocity minimum.
Using our experimental data, we find that our formulation compares well with
recent theoretical and computational work by Zhang et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 875,

then used to establish an equivalence relationship between two different

directly provide the free energy landscape nor the kinetics, which motivated
the development of path sampling extensions, such as transition interface

simultaneously access both kinetics and thermodynamics. However, performing TIS
is more involved than TPS, and still requires (some) insight in the reaction to
define interfaces. While packages that can efficiently compute path ensembles
for TIS are now available, it would be useful to directly compute the free

planning and model learning for solving Partially Observable Markov Decision
Processes (POMDPs) with non-uniform system dynamics. The past decade has seen a
substantial advancement in solving POMDP problems. However, constructing a
suitable POMDP model remains difficult. Recently, neural network architectures
have been proposed to alleviate the difficulty in acquiring such models.
Although the results are promising, existing architectures restrict the type of
system dynamics that can be learned --that is, system dynamics must be the same
in all parts of the state space. TransNet relaxes such a restriction. Key to
this relaxation is a novel neural network module that classifies the state
space into classes and then learns the system dynamics of the different
classes. TransNet uses this module together with the overall architecture of
QMDP-Net[1] to allow solving POMDPs that have more expressive dynamic models,
while maintaining efficient data requirement. Its evaluation on typical
benchmarks in robot navigation with initially unknown system and environment
models indicates that TransNet substantially out-performs the quality of the
generated policies and learning efficiency of the state-of-the-art method
QMDP-Net.

the optimal large deviations rate. Moreover, through a Pinsker type inequality
and a Hoeffding type lemma, we are able to loosen up our Chernoff type bound to
a Hoeffding type bound and reveal the sub-Gaussian nature of the sums. Finally,

products, webpages, or videos, are ubiquitous in the technology industry. Deep
neural networks are being increasingly used for these recommendation problems.
These models use embeddings to represent discrete items as continuous vectors,
and the vocabulary sizes and embedding dimensions, although heavily influence
the model's accuracy, are often manually selected in a heuristical manner. We
present Neural Input Search (NIS), a technique for learning the optimal
vocabulary sizes and embedding dimensions for categorical features. The goal is
to maximize prediction accuracy subject to a constraint on the total memory
used by all embeddings. Moreover, we argue that the traditional Single-size
Embedding (SE), which uses the same embedding dimension for all values of a
feature, suffers from inefficient usage of model capacity and training data. We
propose a novel type of embedding, namely Multi-size Embedding (ME), which
allows the embedding dimension to vary for different values of the feature.
During training we use reinforcement learning to find the optimal vocabulary
size for each feature and embedding dimension for each value of the feature. In
experiments on two common types of large scale recommendation problems, i.e.
retrieval and ranking problems, NIS automatically found better vocabulary and
embedding sizes that result in $6.8\%$ and $1.8\%$ relative improvements on

an extension of the classical stochastic gradient method for single-objective
optimization.
  At each iteration of the SMG method, a stochastic multi-gradient direction is
calculated by solving a quadratic subproblem, and it is shown that this
direction is biased even when all individual gradient estimators are unbiased.
We establish rates to compute a point in the Pareto front, of order similar to
what is known for stochastic gradient in both convex and strongly convex cases.
The analysis handles the bias in the multi-gradient and the unknown a priori
weights of the limiting Pareto point.
  The SMG method is framed into a Pareto-front type algorithm for the
computation of the entire Pareto front. The Pareto-front SMG algorithm is
capable of robustly determining Pareto fronts for a number of synthetic test
problems. One can apply it to any stochastic MOO problem arising from
supervised machine learning, and we report results for logistic binary
classification where multiple objectives correspond to distinct-sources data
groups.

techniques for URLLC services, such as Tactile Internet services. Among typical
use-cases of URLLC services are tele-operation, immersive virtual reality,
cooperative automated driving, and so on. In such URLLC services, new kinds of
traffic such as haptic information including kinesthetic information and
tactile information need to be delivered in addition to high-quality video and
audio traffic in traditional multimedia services. Further, such a variety of
traffic has various characteristics in terms of packet sizes and data rates
with a variety of requirements of latency and reliability. Furthermore, some
traffic may occur in a sporadic manner but require reliable delivery of packets
of medium to large sizes within a low latency, which is not supported by
current state-of-the-art wireless communication systems and is very challenging
for future wireless communication systems. Thus, to meet such a variety of
tight traffic requirements in a wireless communication system, novel
technologies from the physical layer to the network layer need to be devised.
In this paper, some novel physical layer technologies such as waveform
multiplexing, multiple access scheme, channel code design, synchronization, and
full-duplex transmission for spectrally-efficient URLLC are introduced. In
addition, a novel performance evaluation approach, which combines a ray-tracing
tool and system-level simulation, is suggested for evaluating the performance
of the proposed schemes. Simulation results show the feasibility of the
proposed schemes providing realistic URLLC services in realistic geographical
environments, which encourages further efforts to substantiate the proposed
work.

constraints for better common representation learning: classification

ensures the compactness characteristic of the features of the same subcategory,
and ranking constraint ensures the sparsity characteristic of the features of
different subcategories. Extensive experiments verify the usefulness of the new

the compressibility of the flow, both the rms velocity and the rms magnetic
field decay as a power-law in time. In the subsonic case we find that the
exponent of the power-law is consistent with the $-3/5$ scaling reported in
previous studies. However, in the transonic regime both the rms velocity and
the magnetic field initially undergo rapid decay with an $\approx t^{-1.1}$
scaling with time. This is followed by a phase of slow decay where the decay of
the rms velocity exhibits an $\approx -3/5$ scaling in time, while the rms
magnetic field scales as $\approx -5/7$. Furthermore, analysis of the Faraday
rotation measure reveals that the Faraday RM decays also decays as a power law

samples under study are drawn from the integral field spectroscopy (IFS) survey
SDSS-IV MaNGA, including 205 star-forming galaxies in pairs/mergers and ~1350
control galaxies. For each galaxy in pairs, the merger stage is identified
according to its morphological signatures: incoming phase, at first pericenter
passage, at apocenter, in merging phase, and in final coalescence. The effect
of interactions is quantified by the global and spatially resolved SF rate
relative to the SF rate of a control sample selected for each individual galaxy
($\Delta$logSFR and $\Delta$logsSFR(r), respectively). Analysis of the radial
$\Delta$logsSFR(r) distributions shows that galaxy interactions have no
significant impact on the $\Delta$logsSFR(r) during the incoming phase. Right
after the first pericenter passage, the radial $\Delta$logsSFR(r) profile
decreases steeply from enhanced to suppressed activity for increasing
galactocentric radius. Later on, SF is enhanced on a broad spatial scale out to
the maximum radius we explore (~6.7 kpc) and the enhancement is in general
centrally peaked. The extended SF enhancement is also observed for systems at
their apocenters and in the coalescence phase, suggesting that
interaction-triggered SF is not restricted to the central region of a galaxy.
Further explorations of a wide range in parameter space of merger
configurations (e.g., mass ratio) are required to constrain the whole picture

respond to frequency deviations in the system. This work provides a generalized
optimization framework to analyze how to control power and virtual inertia from
storage to participate in frequency response when a large disturbance happens.

cosmology. The magnitude of the effect is very small, i.e. the spectral shift
is of order of $10^{-10} - 10^{-9}$ over the period of a decade, but the next
generation facilities such as ELT and SKA will be able to directly detect the
expansion of our Universe by the year 2040. In this paper we focus on
detectebility of this effect, including strategies of overcoming the kinematic
contamination of the cosmological signal. We also show that the redshift drift
directly impacts the change of flux. Thus apart from the redshift drift,
measurements of the flux drift will provide an additional tool of detecting the
expansion of the universe, including its acceleration. We discuss the
strategies of detecting the flux drift and show that by including the flux
drift signal to the redshift drift signal we boost the chances of a direct
detection of the expansion of the Universe. We show that if only the stability
of flux is at the level of $\Delta F/F \sim 10^{-6}$ then the SKA1-mid Array
should be able to detect these effects, before the ETL and the full SKA. Thus,
by including the flux drift into the SKA1-mid Array's analysis pipeline, we
could be able to provide by mid-2030s a direct evidence of the expansion of the

disciplines. The goal is to forecast the appearance of new links or to find

topology of the network to predict the most likely future or missing
connections between a pair of nodes. However, network evolution is often
mediated by higher-order structures involving more than pairs of nodes; for
example, cliques on three nodes (also called triangles) are key to the

not directly predict these structures. To address this gap, we propose a new
link prediction task called ""pairwise link prediction"" that directly targets
the prediction of new triangles, where one is tasked with finding which nodes
are most likely to form a triangle with a given edge. We develop two
PageRank-based methods for our pairwise link prediction problem and make
natural extensions to existing link prediction methods. Our experiments on a
variety of networks show that diffusion based methods are less sensitive to the

variational optimization problem that aims to extract an ensemble of
band-limited modes containing inherent multivariate modulated oscillations
present in multivariate input signal. The cost function to be minimized is the
sum of bandwidths of all signal modes across all input data channels, which is
a generic extension of the cost function used in standard VMD to multivariate

Existing DAE solvers commonly adopt structural preprocessing methods based on
combinatorial optimization. Unfortunately, the structural methods fail if the
DAE has numerical or symbolic cancellations. For such DAEs, methods have been
proposed to modify them to other DAEs to which the structural methods are
applicable, based on the combinatorial relaxation technique. Existing
modification methods, however, work only for a class of DAEs that are linear or
close to linear.
  This paper presents two new modification methods for nonlinear DAEs: the
substitution method and the augmentation method. Both methods are based on the
combinatorial relaxation approach and are applicable to a large class of
nonlinear DAEs. The substitution method symbolically solves equations for some
derivatives based on the implicit function theorem and substitutes the solution
back into the system. Instead of solving equations, the augmentation method
modifies DAEs by appending new variables and equations. The augmentation method
has advantages that the equation solving is not needed and the sparsity of DAEs
is retained. It is shown in numerical experiments that both methods, especially
the augmentation method, successfully modify high-index DAEs that the DAE

during stellar mergers are often proposed as an explanation for the presence of
strong fields in certain classes of magnetic stars, including high field
magnetic white dwarfs (HFMWDs). In the case of the HFMWDs, the site of the
differential rotation has been variously proposed to be the common envelope
itself, the massive hot outer regions of a merged degenerate core or an
accretion disc formed by a tidally disrupted companion that is subsequently
incorporated into a degenerate core.
  In the present study I explore the possibility that the origin of HFMWDs is
consistent with stellar interactions during the common envelope evolution
(CEE). In this picture the observed fields are caused by an $\alpha-\Omega$
dynamo driven by differential rotation. The strongest fields would arise when
the differential rotation equals the critical break up velocity and would occur
from the merging of two stars during CEE or double degenerate (DD) mergers in a
post common envelope (CE) stage. Those systems that do not coalesce but emerge
from the CE on a close orbit and about to initiate mass transfer will evolve
into magnetic cataclysmic variables (MCVs),
  The population synthesis calculations carried out in this work have shown
that the origin of high fields in isolated white dwarfs (WDs) and in WDs in
MCVs is consistent with stellar interaction during common envelope evolution. I
compare the calculated field strengths to those observed and test the
correlation between theory and observation by means of the Kolmogorov--Smirnov
(K--S) test and show that the resulting correlation is good for values of the
CE energy efficiency parameter, $\alpha{_{\rm{CE}}}$, in the range 0.1--0.3.

future values of unknown disturbances in RNN hidden state. Such encoding allows
the controller generate optimal control signals to actively reject

mining in which large optimization problems are often encountered. ADMM has
several desirable properties, including the ability to decompose large problems

essential in these scenarios. The most common form of ADMM is the two-block, in
which two sets of primal variables are updated alternatingly. Recent years have
seen advances in multi-block ADMM, which update more than two blocks of primal
variables sequentially. In this paper, we study the empirical question: {\em Is
two-block ADMM always comparable with sequential multi-block ADMM solving an
equivalent problem?} In the context of optimization problems arising in
multi-task learning, through a comprehensive set of experiments we surprisingly
show that multi-block ADMM consistently outperformed two-block ADMM on
optimization performance, and as a consequence on prediction performance,
across all datasets and for the entire range of dual step sizes. Our results
have an important practical implication: rather than simply using the popular
two-block ADMM, one may considerably benefit from experimenting with
multi-block ADMM applied to an equivalent problem.

context information) while the decoder produces a trajectory from the context

produce a future trajectory, which is the closest to the true trajectory, while
maximizing a reward from a reward function. The reward function is also trained
at the same time to maximize the margin between the rewards from the
ground-truth trajectory and its estimate. The reward function plays the role of
a regularizer for the proposed model so the trained networks are able to better
utilize the scene context information for the prediction task. We evaluated the
proposed model on several public datasets. Experimental results show that the
prediction performance of the proposed model is much improved by the
regularization, which outperforms the-state-of-the-arts in terms of accuracy.

keyword recognition has been intensively studied in recent years. Such
technology becomes especially pivotal under situations with limited
infrastructures and computational resources, such as voice command recognition
in vehicles and robot interaction. At present, the mainstream methods in
automatic speech keyword recognition are based on long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks with attention mechanism. However, due to inevitable information
losses for the LSTM layer caused during feature extraction, the calculated
attention weights are biased. In this paper, a novel approach, namely
Multi-layer Attention Mechanism, is proposed to handle the inaccurate attention
weights problem. The key idea is that, in addition to the conventional
attention mechanism, information of layers prior to feature extraction and LSTM
are introduced into attention weights calculations. Therefore, the attention
weights are more accurate because the overall model can have more precise and
focused areas. We conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis on the
keyword spotting performances on convolution neural network, bi-directional
LSTM cyclic neural network, and cyclic neural network with the proposed
attention mechanism on Google Speech Command datasets V2 datasets. Experimental
results indicate favorable results for the proposed method and demonstrate the
validity of the proposed method. The proposed multi-layer attention methods can
be useful for other researches related to object spotting.

well as many of the best known nonadditive codes. However, constructing optimal
$n$-qubit codeword stabilized codes is made difficult by two main factors. The
first of these is the exponential growth with $n$ of the number of graphs on
which a code can be based. The second is the NP-hardness of the maximum clique
search required to construct a code from a given graph. We address the second
of these issues through the use of a heuristic clique finding algorithm. This
approach has allowed us to find $((9,97\leq K\leq100,2))$ and $((11,387\leq
K\leq416,2))$ codes, which are larger than any previously known codes. To
address the exponential growth of the search space, we demonstrate that graphs
that give large codes typically yield clique graphs with a large number of
nodes. The number of such nodes can be determined relatively efficiently, and
we demonstrate that $n$-node graphs yielding large clique graphs can be found
using a genetic algorithm. This algorithm uses a novel spectral bisection based
crossover operation that we demonstrate to be superior to more standard
crossover operations. Using this genetic algorithm approach, we have found
$((13,18,4))$ and $((13,20,4))$ codes that are larger than any previously known

that for $n\leq9$, optimal codeword stabilized codes correcting a single
amplitude damping error can be found by considering standard form codes that
detect one of only three of the $3^{n}$ possible equivalent error sets. By
combining this error set selection with the genetic algorithm approach, we have
found $((11,68))$ and $((11,80))$ codes capable of correcting a single

periodic timetables by proposing an extension of the Periodic Event Scheduling
Problem (PESP). In order to model delayed and not nominal travel times already
in the timetabling step, we integrate delay management into the periodic
timetabling problem. After revisiting both (PESP) and delay management
individually, we introduce a periodic delay management model capable of
evaluating periodic timetables with respect to delay resistance. Having
introduced periodic delay management, we define the Robust Periodic Timetabling
problem (RPT). Due to the high complexity of (RPT) we propose two different
simplifications of the problem and introduce solution algorithms for both of
them. These solution algorithms are tested against timetables found by standard
procedures for periodic timetabling with respect to their delay-resistance. The
computational results show that our algorithms yield timetables which can cope
better with occurring delays, even on large-scale datasets and with low
computational effort.

of many piezoceramics can be described by a second order coupled partial

well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem in a bounded domain with

radiative forcings from the main hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, acetylene),
ammonia, collision-induced absorption, four cloud and haze layers (including a
UV-absorbing ""polar"" stratospheric haze) and an internal heat flux. We detail
sensitivity studies of the equilibrium temperature profile to several
parameters. We discuss the expected seasonal, vertical and meridional thermal
structure and compare it to that derived from Cassini and ground-based thermal
infrared observations. We find that the equilibrium temperature in the 5-30
mbar pressure range is very sensitive to the chosen stratospheric haze optical
properties, sizes and number of monomers. The polar haze can significantly warm
the lower stratosphere (10-30 mbar) by up to 20K at latitudes 45-60{\deg}. At
pressures lower than 3 mbar, our modeled temperatures systematically
underestimate the observed ones by 5K. This might suggest that other processes,
such as dynamical heating by wave breaking or by eddies, or a coupling with
thermospheric circulation, play an important role. In the troposphere, we can
only match the observed lack of meridional gradient of temperature by varying
the internal heat flux with latitude. We then exploit knowledge of heating and
cooling rates to diagnose the residual-mean circulation in Jupiter's
stratosphere, under the assumption that the eddy heat flux convergence term is
negligible. In the lower stratosphere (5-30 mbar), the residual-mean
circulation strongly depends on the assumed properties of the stratospheric
haze. Our main conclusion is that it is crucial to improve our knowledge on the
radiative forcing terms to increase our confidence in the estimated
circulation. By extension, this will also be crucial for future 3D GCM studies.

decay leaves a line signal in x-ray spectra; and it is warm dark matter (WDM)
and alters the galactic-scale structure formation of the Universe from that
with WIMP DM. Once a possible x-ray line is reported (e.g., $3.5

check whether or not this FIMP DM is compatible with the structure formation.
Here is an issue: the structure formation constraint on WDM is often reported
in terms of the so-called thermal WDM mass $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$, which cannot be
directly applied to FIMP parameters. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark
FIMP model that represents well a broad class of FIMP models. A big advantage
of this benchmark is that we can derive the analytic formula of the non-thermal
phase space distribution of FIMPs produced from freeze-in processes. By further
deriving a certain ""warmness"" quantity, we can analytically map
$m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ to FIMP parameters. Our analytic map indicates that $7
\,\mathrm{keV}$ FIMP DM, without entropy production or a degenerate spectrum,
is in tension with the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. Our analytic map will
be very useful for future updates of observational constraints and reports of
x-ray lines. It is also very easy to incorporate our analytic formula into a
Boltzmann solver so that a linear matter power spectrum is readily accessible.

obtained by computing explicitly the discrete Wasserstein barycenter of the set
of persistence diagrams, a notoriously computationally intensive task. In
particular, we revisit efficient algorithms for Wasserstein distance
approximation [12,51] to extend previous work on barycenter estimation [94]. We
present a new fast algorithm, which progressively approximates the barycenter
by iteratively increasing the computation accuracy as well as the number of
persistent features in the output diagram. Such a progressivity drastically
improves convergence in practice and allows to design an interruptible
algorithm, capable of respecting computation time constraints. This enables the
approximation of Wasserstein barycenters within interactive times. We present
an application to ensemble clustering where we revisit the k-means algorithm to
exploit our barycenters and compute, within execution time constraints,
meaningful clusters of ensemble data along with their barycenter diagram.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-life data sets report that our
algorithm converges to barycenters that are qualitatively meaningful with

techniques, while offering an order of magnitude speedup when run until
convergence (without time constraint). Our algorithm can be trivially

photomultipliers, but the majority of current and upcoming IACT cameras have
the capacity to read out the entire photosensor waveform following a trigger.
As the arrival times of Cherenkov photons from extensive air showers (EAS) at
the camera plane are dependent upon the altitude of their emission, these
waveforms contain information useful for IACT event classification. In this
work, we investigate the potential for using these waveforms with ML
techniques, and find that a highly effective means of utilising their
information is to create a set of seven additional two dimensional histograms
of waveform parameters to be fed into the machine learning algorithm along with
the integrated charge image. This appears to be superior to using only these
new ML techniques with the waveform integrated charge alone. We also examine
these timing-based ML techniques in the context of other experiments.

dimensions via a field dependent gauge kinetic term. The localization takes
place when a stabilizer (a scalar field) is condensed in the topological
soliton. We show that the localized gauge bosons are massless when the
stabilizer is neutral. On the other hand, they become massive for the charged
stabilizer as a consequence of interplay between the localization mechanism and
the Higgs mechanism. For concreteness, we give two examples in six dimensions.
The one is domain wall intersections and the other is an axially symmetric
soliton background.

considered to be a promising method for the production of new exotic nuclei,
which are difficult to be produced by other methods. The theoretical studies
are required to provide reliable predictions for the experiments and promote
the understanding of the microscopic mechanism in multinucleon transfer
reactions. \item[Purpose] We provide a predictive approach for production cross
sections, and testify how and to what extent the microscopic approach works
well in multinucleon transfer reaction. \item[Methods] We employ the approach
TDHF+GEMINI, which combines the microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF)
with the state-of-art statistical model GEMINI++, to take into account both the
multinucleon transfer dynamics and the secondary deexcitation process. The
properties of primary products in multinucleon transfer process, such as
transfer probabilities and primary cross sections, are extracted from TDHF
dynamics by using the particle-number projection method. Production cross
sections for secondary products are evaluated by using the statistical model
GEMINI++. \item[Results] We investigate the influence of colliding energies and
deformation orientations of target and projectile nuclei on multinucleon
transfer dynamics in the reaction $^{58}$Ni+$^{124}$Sn...... \item[Conclusions]
The microscopic approach TDHF+GEMINI reasonably reproduces the experimental
data at energies close to the Coulomb barrier and well accounts for the
multinucleon transfer mechanism. The present studies clearly reveal the
applicability of TDHF+GEMINI method in multinucleon transfer reactions, which
thus deserves as a promising tool to predict the properties of new reactions.

nonadjacent vertices in a given graph with the maximum possible cardinality. In
general graphs, this classical problem is known to be NP-hard and hard to
approximate within a factor of $n^{1-\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$.
Due to this, investigating the complexity of Maximum Independent Set in various
graph classes in hope of finding better tractability results is an active
research direction.
  In $H$-free graphs, that is, graphs not containing a fixed graph $H$ as an
induced subgraph, the problem is known to remain NP-hard and APX-hard whenever
$H$ contains a cycle, a vertex of degree at least four, or two vertices of
degree at least three in one connected component. For the remaining cases,
where every component of $H$ is a path or a subdivided claw, the complexity of
Maximum Independent Set remains widely open, with only a handful of
polynomial-time solvability results for small graphs $H$ such as $P_5$, $P_6$,
the claw, or the fork.
  We show that for every graph $H$ for which Maximum Independent Set is not
known to be APX-hard and SUBEXP-hard in $H$-free graphs, the problem admits a
quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme and a subexponential-time exact
algorithm in this graph class. Our algorithm works also in the more general
weighted setting, where the input graph is supplied with a weight function on
vertices and we are maximizing the total weight of an independent set.

of the families of parameters that allow to capture notions of sparsity of
graphs: A class of graphs has bounded expansion if and only if there is a
function $f$ such that for every $p\geq1$, every graph in the class admits a
$p$-centered coloring using at most $f(p)$ colors.
  In this paper, we give upper bounds for the maximum number of colors needed
in a $p$-centered coloring of graphs from several widely studied graph classes.
We show that: (1) planar graphs admit $p$-centered colorings with
$\mathcal{O}(p^3\log p)$ colors where the previous bound was
$\mathcal{O}(p^{19})$; (2) bounded degree graphs admit $p$-centered colorings
with $\mathcal{O}(p)$ colors while it was conjectured that they may require
exponential number of colors in $p$; (3) graphs avoiding a fixed graph as a
topological minor admit $p$-centered colorings with a polynomial in $p$ number
of colors. All these upper bounds imply polynomial algorithms for computing the
colorings. Prior to this work there were no non-trivial lower bounds known. We
show that: (4) there are graphs of treewidth $t$ that require $\binom{p+t}{t}$
colors in any $p$-centered coloring and this bound matches the upper bound; (5)
there are planar graphs that require $\Omega(p^2\log p)$ colors in any

description of the radiation-matter interaction. Several numerical
(magneto)hydrodynamics codes were upgraded with a radiation module to fulfill
this request. However, those among them that use either the flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) or the M1 radiation moment approaches are restricted to the
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This assumption may be not valid in some
astrophysical cases. We present an upgraded version of the LTE
radiation-hydrodynamics module implemented in the PLUTO code, originally
developed by Kolb et al. (2013), which we have extended to handle non-LTE
regimes. Starting from the general frequency-integrated comoving-frame
equations of radiation hydrodynamics (RHD), we have justified all the
assumptions made to obtain the non-LTE equations actually implemented in the
module, under the FLD approximation. An operator-split method is employed, with
two substeps: the hydrodynamic part is solved with an explicit method by the
solvers already available in PLUTO, the non-LTE radiation diffusion and energy
exchange part is solved with an implicit method. The module is implemented in
the PLUTO environment. It uses databases of radiative quantities that can be
provided independently by the user: the radiative power loss, the Planck and
Rosseland mean opacities. Our implementation has been validated through
different tests, in particular radiative shock tests. The agreement with the
semi-analytical solutions (when available) is good, with a maximum error of 7%.
Moreover, we have proved that non-LTE approach is of paramount importance to
properly model accretion shock structures. Our radiation FLD module represents
a step toward the general non-LTE RHD modeling. The module is available, under

for training modern neural net architectures. Although a small initial learning
rate allows for faster training and better test performance initially, the
large learning rate achieves better generalization soon after the learning rate
is annealed. Towards explaining this phenomenon, we devise a setting in which
we can prove that a two layer network trained with large initial learning rate
and annealing provably generalizes better than the same network trained with a
small learning rate from the start. The key insight in our analysis is that the
order of learning different types of patterns is crucial: because the small
learning rate model first memorizes easy-to-generalize, hard-to-fit patterns,
it generalizes worse on hard-to-generalize, easier-to-fit patterns than its
large learning rate counterpart. This concept translates to a larger-scale
setting: we demonstrate that one can add a small patch to CIFAR-10 images that
is immediately memorizable by a model with small initial learning rate, but
ignored by the model with large learning rate until after annealing. Our
experiments show that this causes the small learning rate model's accuracy on
unmodified images to suffer, as it relies too much on the patch early on.

of this problem is to distribute $m$ goods to $n$ agents in a ""fair"" manner,
where every agent has a valuation for each subset of goods. We assume general
valuations.
  Envy-freeness is the most extensively studied notion of fairness. However,
envy-free allocations do not always exist when goods are indivisible. The
notion of fairness we consider here is ""envy-freeness up to any good"" (EFX)
where no agent envies another agent after the removal of any single good from
the other agent's bundle. It is not known if such an allocation always exists
even when $n=3$.
  We show there is always a partition of the set of goods into $n+1$ subsets
$(X_1,\ldots,X_n,P)$ where for $i \in [n]$, $X_i$ is the bundle allocated to
agent $i$ and the set $P$ is unallocated (or donated to charity) such that we
have$\colon$
  1) envy-freeness up to any good,
  2) no agent values $P$ higher than her own bundle, and
  3) fewer than $n$ goods go to charity, i.e., $|P| < n$ (typically $m \gg n$).
  Our proof is constructive. When agents have additive valuations and $\lvert P
\rvert$ is large (i.e., when $|P|$ is close to $n$), our allocation also has a
good maximin share (MMS) guarantee. Moreover, a minor variant of our algorithm
also shows the existence of an allocation which is $4/7$ groupwise maximin
share (GMMS): this is a notion of fairness stronger than MMS. This improves
upon the current best bound of $1/2$ known for an approximate GMMS allocation.

  Communication Networks","This work will be presented in part at the 2019 IEEE International
  Symposium on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In communication networks secrecy constraints usually incur an extra limit in
capacity or generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF), in the sense that a penalty
in capacity or GDoF is incurred due to the secrecy constraints. Over the past
decades a significant amount of effort has been made by the researchers to
understand the limits of secrecy constraints in communication networks. In this
work, we focus on how to remove the secrecy constraints in communication
networks, i.e., how to remove the GDoF penalty due to secrecy constraints. We
begin with three basic settings: a two-user symmetric Gaussian interference
channel with confidential messages, a symmetric Gaussian wiretap channel with a
helper, and a two-user symmetric Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel.
Interestingly, in this work we show that adding common randomness at the
transmitters can totally remove the penalty in GDoF or GDoF region of the three
settings considered here. The results reveal that adding common randomness at
the transmitters is a powerful way to remove the secrecy constraints in
communication networks in terms of GDoF performance. Common randomness can be
generated offline. The role of the common randomness is to jam the information
signal at the eavesdroppers, without causing too much interference at the
legitimate receivers. To accomplish this role, a new method of Markov
chain-based interference neutralization is proposed in the achievability
schemes utilizing common randomness. From the practical point of view, we hope
to use less common randomness to remove secrecy constraints in terms of GDoF
performance. With this motivation, for most of the cases we characterize the
minimal GDoF of common randomness to remove secrecy constraints, based on our
derived converses and achievability.

advantageous data analysis has the potential to provide a lot more insight into
given data set, in particular when being close to the resolution limit where
the noise becomes at least of the same order as the signal. In this work, we
introduce two tools - the average latent dimension and average latent entropy -
which allow for the detection of very subtle material inhomogeneity patterns in
the data. For example, for the Ising model, we show that these tools are able
to resolve exchange differences down to $1\%$. For a micromagnetic model, we
demonstrate that the latent entropy can be used to detect changes in the easy
axis anisotropy from magnetization data. We show that the latent entropy
remains robust when imposing noise on the data, changing less than $0.3\%$
after adding Gaussian noise of the same amplitude as the signal. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that these data-driven tools can be used to visualize
inhomogeneities based on MOKE data of magnetic whirls and thereby can help to
explicitly resolve impurities and pinning centers. To evaluate the performance
of the average latent dimension and entropy, we show that they outperform
common instruments ranging from standard statistics measures to
state-of-the-art data analysis techniques such as Gaussian mixture models not

stellar density, and ISM properties. In this work, we present the first
theoretical framework quantifying the distribution of PPD dispersal time-scales
as a function of parameters that describe the galactic environment. We
calculate the probability density function for FUV flux and stellar density in
the solar neighbourhood. In agreement with previous studies, we find that
external photoevaporation is the dominant environment-related factor
influencing local stellar populations after the embedded phase. Applying our
general prescription to the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way (i.e. the
central ~250 pc), we predict that 90% of PPDs in the region are destroyed
within 1 Myr of the dispersal of the parent molecular cloud. Even in such dense
environments, we find that external photoevaporation is the dominant disc
depletion mechanism over dynamical encounters between stars. PPDs around
low-mass stars are particularly sensitive to FUV-induced mass loss, due to a
shallower gravitational potential. For stars of mass ~1 $M_\odot$, the solar
neighbourhood lies at approximately the highest gas surface density for which
PPD dispersal is still relatively unaffected by external FUV photons, with a
median PPD dispersal timescale of ~4 Myr. We highlight the key questions to be
addressed to further contextualise the significance of the local galactic
environment for planet formation.

theoretical modelling. This allowed us to unveil exciton transport throughout
the entire hierarchical supramolecular structure of a double-walled artificial

high excitation fluences it protects the inner tube from overburning. Our
findings shed light on the excitonic trajectories across different sub-units of
a multi-layered supramolecular structure and underpin the great potential of

ferromagnetism with spontaneously broken spin and valley symmetry. The

Notably the ground state at $\nu=0$ is believed to be a canted
antiferromagnetic (AF) or a ferromagnetic (F) state depending on the component
of the magnetic field parallel to the layer and the strength of small
anisotropies. We study the skyrmions for the filling factors $\nu=\pm 1,0$ by
using exact diagonalizations on the spherical geometry. If we neglect
anisotropies we confirm the validity of the standard skyrmion picture
generalized to four degrees of freedom. For filling factor $\nu=- 1$ the hole
skyrmion is an infinite-size valley skyrmion with full spin polarization
because it does not feel the anisotropies. The electron skyrmion is also always
of infinite size. In the F phase it is always fully polarized while in the AF
phase it undergoes continuous magnetization under increasing Zeeman energy. In
the case of $\nu=0$ the skyrmion is always maximally localized in space both in
F and AF phase. In the F phase it is fully polarized while in the AF it has
also progressive magnetization with Zeeman energy. The magnetization process is
unrelated to the spatial profile of the skyrmions contrary to the SU(2) case.
In all cases the skyrmion physics is dominated by the competition between
anisotropies and Zeeman effect but not directly by the Coulomb interactions,
breaking universal scaling with the ratio Zeeman to Coulomb energy.

introduce a new widely-applicable inference method that combines an extension
of the alive particle filter (APF) with automatic Rao-Blackwellization via
delayed sampling. Birth-death models of evolution are an important family of
phylogenetic models of the diversification processes that lead to evolutionary
trees. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) give phylogeneticists a new
and exciting tool: their models can be implemented as probabilistic programs
with just a basic knowledge of programming. The general inference methods in
PPLs reduce the need for external experts, allow quick prototyping and testing,
and accelerate the development and deployment of new models. We show how these
birth-death models can be implemented as simple programs in existing PPLs, and
demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed inference method for such models.
For the popular BiSSE model the method yields an increase of the effective
sample size and the conditional acceptance rate by a factor of 30 in comparison
with a standard bootstrap particle filter. Although concentrating on
phylogenetics, the extended APF is a general inference method that shows its
strength in situations where particles are often assigned zero weight. In the
case when the weights are always positive, the extra cost of using the APF
rather than the bootstrap particle filter is negligible, making our method a
suitable drop-in replacement for the bootstrap particle filter in probabilistic
programming inference.

feasible motions for humanoid robots. However, including uncertainties and
stochasticity in the TO problem to generate robust motions can easily lead to
intractable problems. Furthermore, since the models used in TO have always some
level of abstraction, it can be hard to find a realistic set of uncertainties
in the model space. In this paper we leverage a sample-efficient learning
technique (Bayesian optimization) to robustify TO for humanoid locomotion. The
main idea is to use data from full-body simulations to make the TO stage robust
by tuning the cost weights. To this end, we split the TO problem into two
phases. The first phase solves a convex optimization problem for generating
center of mass (CoM) trajectories based on simplified linear dynamics. The
second stage employs iterative Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) as a whole-body
controller to generate full body control inputs. Then we use Bayesian
optimization to find the cost weights to use in the first stage that yields
robust performance in the simulation/experiment, in the presence of different
disturbance/uncertainties. The results show that the proposed approach is able
to generate robust motions for different sets of disturbances and
uncertainties.

and are released during the ice sublimation. Using a local one-dimensional
code, we solve the radial drift and the turbulent diffusion of solids and the
water vapor, taking account of their sublimation/condensation around the snow

gas on the radial drift and diffusion of solids, scale height evolution of the
released silicate particles, and possible difference in effective viscous
parameters between that for turbulent diffusion ($\alpha_{\rm tur}$) and that
for the gas accretion rate onto the central star ($\alpha_{\rm acc}$). We study
the dependence on the ratio of the solid mass flux to the gas ($F_{\rm p/g}$).
We show that the favorable locations for the pile-up of silicate grains and icy
pebbles are the regions in the proximity of the water snow line inside and
outside it, respectively. We found that runaway pile-ups occur when both the
back-reactions for radial drift and diffusion are included. In the case with
only the back-reaction for the radial drift, no runaway pile-up is found except
for extremely high pebble flux, while the condition of streaming instability
can be satisfied for relatively large $F_{\rm p/g}$ as found in the past
literatures. If the back-reactions for radial diffusion is considered, the
runaway pile-up occurs for reasonable value of pebble flux. The runaway pile-up
of silicate grains that would lead to formation of rocky planetesimals occurs
for $\alpha_{\rm tur} \ll \alpha_{\rm acc}$, while the runaway pile-up of icy
pebbles is favored for $\alpha_{\rm tur} \sim \alpha_{\rm acc}$.

is challenging due to the strict requirement of positivity of the turbulent

framework for analyzing the performance of any spherical code in this context,
and we provide results for various codes from the literature, such as those
related to regular polytopes and root lattices. Similar to hyperplane hashing,
and unlike cross-polytope hashing, our analysis of collision probabilities and
query exponents is exact and does not hide order terms which vanish only for
large $d$, facilitating an easy parameter selection.
  For the two-dimensional case, we derive closed-form expressions for arbitrary
spherical codes, and we show that the equilateral triangle is optimal,
achieving a better performance than the two-dimensional analogues of hyperplane

that the tetrahedron, $5$-cell, and $16$-cell achieve the best query exponents,
while in five or more dimensions orthoplices appear to outperform regular
simplices, as well as the root lattice families $A_k$ and $D_k$. We argue that
in higher dimensions, larger spherical codes will likely exist which will
outperform orthoplices in theory, and we argue why using the $D_k$ root

understanding. However, designing a high-performance neural architecture
requires substantial efforts and expertise. In this paper, we make the first
attempt to let algorithm automatically design neural networks for video action
recognition tasks. Specifically, a spatio-temporal network is developed in a
differentiable space modeled by a directed acyclic graph, thus a gradient-based
strategy can be performed to search an optimal architecture. Nonetheless, it is
computationally expensive, since the computational burden to evaluate each
architecture candidate is still heavy. To alleviate this issue, we, for the
video input, introduce a temporal segment approach to reduce the computational
cost without losing global video information. For the architecture, we explore
in an efficient search space by introducing pseudo 3D operators. Experiments
show that, our architecture outperforms popular neural architectures, under the

surprisingly, with only around one percentage of parameters of its

abundances for 51 Galactic A-, F- and G-type supergiants and bright giants is
performed. In contrast with carbon and nitrogen, oxygen does not show any
significant systematic anomalies in their abundances log E(O). There is no
marked difference from the initial oxygen abundance within errors of the log
E(O) determination across the Teff interval from 4500 to 8500 K and the log g
interval from 1.2 to 2.9 dex. This result agrees well with theoretical
predictions for stellar models with rotation. With our new data for oxygen and
our earlier non-LTE determinations of the N and C abundances for stars from the
same sample, we constructed the [N/C] vs [N/O] relation for 17 stars. This
relation is known to be a sensitive indicator of stellar evolution. A
pronounced correlation between [N/C] vs [N/O] is found; the observed [N/C]
increase from 0 to 1.6 dex is accompanied by the [N/O] increase from 0 to 0.9
dex. When comparing the observed [N/C] vs [N/O] relation with the theoretical
one, we show that this relation reflects a strong dependence of the
evolutionary changes in CNO abundances on the initial rotation velocities of
stars. Given that the initial rotational velocities of these stars are expected
to satisfy V0<150 km/s, it is found that they are mostly the post first
dredge-up (post-FDU) objects. It is important that just such initial velocities
V0 are typical for about 80% of stars in question (i.e. for stars with masses
4-19 M_sun). A constancy of the total C+N+O abundance during stellar evolution
is confirmed. The mean value log E(C+N+O)=8.97+/-0.08 found for AFG supergiants

the selection of a positive parameter $\theta_k$ in the $k$th iteration, and
generates a positive vector sequence approximating the eigenvector of NAEP and
a scalar sequence approximating the corresponding eigenvalue. We also present a
halving procedure to determine the parameters $\theta_k$, starting with

resolving the strong CP problem of QCD and generating axionic dark matter,

perception through Fuzzy Sets (FSs). Most of this research has focused on
allowing respondents to express their (intra) uncertainty using intervals.
Here, depending on the technique used and types of uncertainties being modelled
different types of FSs can be obtained (e.g., Type-1, Interval Type-2, General
Type-2). Arguably, one of the most flexible techniques is the Interval
Agreement Approach (IAA) as it allows to model the perception of all
respondents without making assumptions such as outlier removal or predefined
membership function types (e.g. Gaussian). A key aspect in the analysis of
interval-valued data and indeed, IAA based agreement models of said data, is to
determine the position and strengths of agreement across all the
sources/participants. While previously, the Agreement Ratio was proposed to
measure the strength of agreement in fuzzy set based models of interval data,
said measure has only been applicable to type-1 fuzzy sets. In this paper, we
extend the Agreement Ratio to capture the degree of inter-group agreement
modelled by a General Type-2 Fuzzy Set when using the IAA. This measure relies
on using a similarity measure to quantitatively express the relation between
the different levels of agreement in a given FS. Synthetic examples are
provided in order to demonstrate both behaviour and calculation of the measure.
Finally, an application to real-world data is provided in order to show the
potential of this measure to assess the divergence of opinions for ambiguous
concepts when heterogeneous groups of participants are involved.

quality factor single mode optical resonator. The hybridization of the emitter
and photon wave functions mandates large vacuum Rabi frequencies and long
coherence times; features that so far have been successfully realized with
trapped cold atoms and ions and localized solid state quantum emitters such as
superconducting circuits, quantum dots, and color centers. Thermal atoms on the
other hand, provide us with a dense emitter ensemble and in comparison to the
cold systems are more compatible with integration, hence enabling large-scale
quantum systems. However, their thermal motion and large transit time
broadening is a major challenge that has to be circumvented. A promising remedy
could benefit from the highly controllable and tunable electromagnetic fields
of a nano-photonic cavity with strong local electric-field enhancements.
Utilizing this feature, here we calculate the interaction between fast moving,
thermal atoms and a nano-beam photonic crystal cavity (PCC) with large quality
factor and small mode volume. Through fully quantum mechanical calculations,
including Casimir-Polder potential (i.e. the effect of the surface on radiation
properties of an atom) we show, when designed properly, the achievable coupling
between the flying atom and the cavity photon would be strong enough to lead to
Rabi flopping in spite of short interaction times. In addition, the
time-resolved detection of different trajectories can be used to identify
single and multiple atom counts. This probabilistic approach will find
applications in cavity QED studies in dense atomic media and paves the way
towards realizing coherent quantum control schemes in large-scale macroscopic
systems aimed at out of the lab quantum devices.

to the robotics community as it may render the learning process faster,

to reality is a major challenge. Optimizing a policy on a slightly faulty
simulator can easily lead to the maximization of the `Simulation Optimization
Bias` (SOB). In this case, the optimizer exploits modeling errors of the
simulator such that the resulting behavior can potentially damage the robot. We
tackle this challenge by applying domain randomization, i.e., randomizing the
parameters of the physics simulations during learning. We propose an algorithm
called Simulation-based Policy Optimization with Transferability Assessment
(SPOTA) which uses an estimator of the SOB to formulate a stopping criterion
for training. The introduced estimator quantifies the over-fitting to the set
of domains experienced while training. Our experimental results on two
different second order nonlinear systems show that the new simulation-based
policy search algorithm is able to learn a control policy exclusively from a
randomized simulator, which can be applied directly to real systems without any
additional training.

paper, we propose a data-driven method that leverages historical information to
screen out network constraints in the TC-UC problem. First, past data on demand
and renewable generation throughout the network are used to learn the
congestion status of transmission lines. Then, we infer the lines that will not
become congested for upcoming operating conditions based on such learning and
disregard their capacity constraints. This way, we formulate a reduced TC-UC
problem that is easier to solve. Numerical results on a medium- and a
large-size power system show that the proposed approach outperforms existing
ones by significantly reducing the computational time while obtaining solutions
that are equal or close to the one obtained with the original TC-UC problem.
Furthermore, the purely data-driven method we propose can be seamlessly
complemented with a constraint generation procedure to guarantee that the
optimal solution to the original TC-UC problem is eventually recovered.

local antiferromagnetic environment on the scale $\xi_{AF}$, the magnetic

nearest neighbours gives rise to the anomalous angular dependence of the gap,
in quantitative agreement with experiments. This simple interpretation strongly
indicates a common origin of the nodal and antinodal gaps.

crossing flux lines, which are the simplest degrees of freedom of the
3-coloring lattice model. We show that the dynamical obstruction is the
consequence of two effects: (i) conservation laws described by a set of
invariants that are polynomials of the winding numbers of the loop
configuration, (ii) steric obstruction that prevents paths between
configurations, for lack of free space. We argue that the invariants fully
classify the configurations in five, chiral and achiral, sectors and no further
obstruction in the limit of low-winding numbers.

  Applicability in Virtual Environments",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visualizations rely on highlighting to attract and guide our attention. To
make an object of interest stand out independently from a number of
distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has to be preattentive. In
our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting
technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In
contrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual
properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method
requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a
considerable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this
paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations,
because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the
box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we
cannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this
motivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR,
including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an
important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness
(all average accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we
explore VR volume rendering as an example application scenario for Deadeye. We
depict a possible workflow for integrating our technique, conduct an
exploratory survey to demonstrate benefits and limitations, and finally provide
related design implications.

each node to refine the original graph into a label-aware~(LA) graph. Existing
GCN models can directly learn from the LA graph to improve the performance
without changing their model architectures. Second, we introduce the concept of
positive ratio to evaluate the density of valuable neighbors in the LA graph.
Theoretical analysis reveals that using the edge classifier to increase the
positive ratio can improve the learning performance of existing GCN models.
Third, we conduct extensive node classification experiments on benchmark
datasets. The results verify that LAGCN can improve the performance of existing
GCN models considerably, in terms of node classification.

the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method and linearized spin wave

the presence of $J_3$, whereas, in the large $J_2/J_3$ limit non-collinear

maintenance. In particular, train units are commonly maintained and cleaned at
dedicated shunting yards. The planning problem that results from such
situations is referred to as the Train Unit Shunting Problem (TUSP). This
problem involves matching arriving train units to service tasks and determining
the schedule for departing trains. The TUSP is an important problem as it is
used to determine the capacity of shunting yards and arises as a sub-problem of
more general scheduling and planning problems. In this paper, we consider the
case of the Dutch Railways (NS) TUSP. As the TUSP is complex, NS currently uses
a local search (LS) heuristic to determine if an instance of the TUSP has a
feasible solution. Given the number of shunting yards and the size of the
planning problems, improving the evaluation speed of the LS brings significant
computational gain. In this work, we use a machine learning approach that
complements the LS and accelerates the search process. We use a Deep Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) model to predict the feasibility of
solutions obtained during the run of the LS heuristic. We use this model to
decide whether to continue or abort the search process. In this way, the
computation time is used more efficiently as it is spent on instances that are
more likely to be feasible. Using simulations based on real-life instances of
the TUSP, we show how our approach improves upon the previous method on
prediction accuracy and leads to computational gains for the decision-making
process.

sections computed at the amplitude level are well defined, and their sum
reproduces the full results, up to non negligible but computable interference
effects which should be included in experimental analyses. We show that
polarized cross sections computed using the reweighting method are inaccurate,

examine the steady-state ionic concentrations and electric potential profiles

latent space conveys interpretable characteristics of dysarthria, such as
intelligibility and fluency of speech. MUSHRA perceptual test demonstrated that
the adaptation of the latent space let the model generate speech of improved

dysarthria with higher accuracy. This is thanks to a low-dimensional latent

Most related works focus on using complicated compositionality functions to
model SC while few works consider external knowledge in models. In this paper,
we verify the effectiveness of sememes, the minimum semantic units of human
languages, in modeling SC by a confirmatory experiment. Furthermore, we make
the first attempt to incorporate sememe knowledge into SC models, and employ
the sememeincorporated models in learning representations of multiword
expressions, a typical task of SC. In experiments, we implement our models by
incorporating knowledge from a famous sememe knowledge base HowNet and perform
both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. Experimental results show that our
models achieve significant performance boost as compared to the baseline
methods without considering sememe knowledge. We further conduct quantitative
analysis and case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of applying sememe

  Minimum Spanning Forest: Dynamic Algorithms Meet Property Testing",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With few exceptions (namely, algorithms for maximal matching, $2$-approximate
vertex cover, and certain constant-stretch spanners), all known fully dynamic
algorithms in general graphs require (amortized) $\Omega(\log n)$ update/query
time. Showing for the first time that techniques from property testing can lead
to constant-time fully dynamic graph algorithms we prove the following results:
  (1) We give a fully dynamic (Las-Vegas style) algorithm with constant
expected amortized time per update that maintains a proper $(\Delta+1)$-vertex
coloring of a graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$. This improves upon
the previous $O(\log \Delta)$-time algorithm by Bhattacharya et al. (SODA
2018). We show that our result does not only have optimal running time, but is
also optimal in the sense that already deciding whether a $\Delta$-coloring
exists in a dynamically changing graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$
takes $\Omega(\log n)$ time per operation.
  (2) We give two fully dynamic algorithms that maintain a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the weight $M$ of the minimum spanning
forest of a graph $G$ with edges weights in $[1,W]$. Our deterministic
algorithm takes $O({W^2 \log W}/{\varepsilon^3})$ worst-case time, which is
constant if both $W$ and $\varepsilon$ are constant. This is somewhat
surprising as a lower bound by Patrascu and Demaine (SIAM J. Comput. 2006)
shows that it takes $\Omega(\log n)$ time per operation to maintain the exact
weight of the MSF that holds even for $W=1$. Our randomized (Monte-Carlo style)
algorithm works with high probability and runs in worst-case
$O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\log^2(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}))$ time if $W=
O({(m^*)^{1/3}}/{\log^3 n})$, where $m^*$ is the minimum number of edges in the
graph throughout all the updates. It works even against an adaptive adversary.

edges. The hypergraphs have a high probability of being peelable, i.e. to admit
no sub-hypergraph of minimum degree $2$, even when the edge density (number of
edges over vertices) is close to $1$. In our construction, the vertex set is
partitioned into linearly arranged segments and each edge is incident to random
vertices of $k$ consecutive segments. Quite surprisingly, the linear geometry
allows our graphs to be peeled ""from the outside in"". The density thresholds
$f_k$ for peelability of our hypergraphs ($f_3 \approx 0.918$, $f_4 \approx
0.977$, $f_5 \approx 0.992$, ...) are well beyond the corresponding thresholds
($c_3 \approx 0.818$, $c_4 \approx 0.772$, $c_5 \approx 0.702$, ...) of
standard $k$-uniform random hypergraphs. To get a grip on $f_k$, we analyse an
idealised peeling process on the random weak limit of our hypergraph family.
The process can be described in terms of an operator on functions and $f_k$ can
be linked to thresholds relating to the operator. These thresholds are then
tractable with numerical methods.
  Random hypergraphs underlie the construction of various data structures based
on hashing. These data structures frequently rely on peelability of the
hypergraph or peelability allows for simple linear time algorithms. To
demonstrate the usefulness of our construction, we used our $3$-uniform
hypergraphs as a drop-in replacement for the standard $3$-uniform hypergraphs
in a retrieval data structure by Botelho et al. This reduces memory usage from
$1.23m$ bits to $1.12m$ bits ($m$ being the input size) with almost no change

matrices that have full row rank over $\mathbb{F}_2=\{0,1\}$ with high
probability and can be transformed into echelon form in almost linear time by a
simple version of Gauss elimination. The random matrix with dimensions
$n(1-\varepsilon) \times n$ is generated as follows: In each row, identify a
block of length $L=O((\log n)/\varepsilon)$ at a random position. The entries
outside the block are 0, the entries inside the block are given by fair coin
tosses. Sorting the rows according to the positions of the blocks transforms
the matrix into a kind of band matrix, on which, as it turns out, Gauss
elimination works very efficiently with high probability. For the proof, the
effects of Gauss elimination are interpreted as a (""coin-flipping"") variant of
Robin Hood hashing, whose behaviour can be captured in terms of a simple Markov
model from queuing theory. Bounds for expected construction time and high
success probability follow from results in this area.
  By employing hashing, this matrix family leads to a new implementation of a
retrieval data structure, which represents an arbitrary function $f\colon S \to
\{0,1\}$ for some set $S$ of $m=(1-\varepsilon)n$ keys. It requires
$m/(1-\varepsilon)$ bits of space, construction takes $O(m/\varepsilon^2$)
expected time on a word RAM, while queries take $O(1/\varepsilon)$ time and
access only one contiguous segment of $O((\log m)/\varepsilon)$ bits in the
representation. The method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. By
well-established methods the retrieval data structure leads to efficient
constructions of (static) perfect hash functions and (static) Bloom filters
with almost optimal space and very local storage access patterns for queries.

regular expression $R$ and a string $Q$, decide if $Q$ matches any of the
strings specified by $R$. A standard textbook solution [Thompson, CACM 1968]
solves this problem in $O(nm)$ time, where $n$ is the length of $Q$ and $m$ is
the number of characters in $R$. More recently, several results that improve
this bound by polylogarithmic factor have appeared. All of these solutions are
essentially based on constructing and simulation a non-deterministic finite
automaton. On the other hand, assuming the strong exponential time hypotheses
we cannot solve regular expression $O((nm)^{1-\epsilon})$ [Backurs and Indyk,
FOCS 2016]. Hence, a natural question is if we can design algorithms that can
take advantage of other parameters of the problem to obtain more fine-grained
bounds. We present the first algorithm for regular expression matching that can
take advantage of sparsity of the automaton simulation. More precisely, we
define the \emph{density}, $\Delta$, of the instance to be the total number of
states in a simulation of a natural automaton for $R$. The density is always at
most $nm+1$ but may be significantly smaller for many typical scenarios, e.g.,
when a string only matches a small part of the regular expression. Our main
result is a new algorithm that solves the problem in $$O\left(\Delta \log \log
\frac{nm}{\Delta} + n + m\right)$$ time. This result essentially replaces $nm$
with $\Delta$ in the complexity of regular expression matching. Prior to this
work no non-trivial bound in terms of $\Delta$ was known. The key technical
contribution is a new linear space representation of the classic position
automaton that supports fast state-set transition computation in near-linear
time in the size of the input and output state sets.

civil infrastructure. We here propose a Bayesian approach for predicting
extreme floods using the generalized extreme-value (GEV) distribution within
gauged and ungauged catchments. A major methodological challenge is to find a
suitable parametrization for the GEV distribution when covariates or latent
spatial effects are involved. Other challenges involve balancing model
complexity and parsimony using an appropriate model selection procedure, and
making inference using a reliable and computationally efficient approach. Our
approach relies on a latent Gaussian modeling framework with a novel
multivariate link function designed to separate the interpretation of the
parameters at the latent level and to avoid unreasonable estimates of the shape
and time trend parameters. Structured additive regression models are proposed
for the four parameters at the latent level. For computational efficiency with
large datasets and richly parametrized models, we exploit an accurate and fast
approximate Bayesian inference approach. We applied our proposed methodology to
annual peak river flow data from 554 catchments across the United Kingdom (UK).
Our model performed well in terms of flood predictions for both gauged and
ungauged catchments. The results show that the spatial model components for the
transformed location and scale parameters, and the time trend, are all
important. Posterior estimates of the time trend parameters correspond to an
average increase of about $1.5\%$ per decade and reveal a spatial structure
across the UK. To estimate return levels for spatial aggregates, we further
develop a novel copula-based post-processing approach of posterior predictive
samples, in order to mitigate the effect of the conditional independence
assumption at the data level, and we show that our approach provides accurate
results.

species. This paper evaluates the bird-train collision risk associated with a
recent high-speed railway project in Qinling Mountains, China, for the crested
ibis (Nipponia nippon) and other local bird species. Using line transect
surveys and walking monitoring techniques, we surveyed the population
abundance, spatial-temporal distributions, and bridge-crossing behaviors of the
birds in the study area. The results show that: (1) The crested ibis and the
egret were the two most abundant waterfowl species in the study area. The RAI
of these two species were about 43.69% and 42.91%, respectively; (2) Crested
ibises overall habitat closer to the railway bridge. 91.63% of them were
firstly detected within the range of 0m to 25m of the vicinity of the bridge;
(3) the ratio between crossing over and under the railway bridge was about 7:3.
Crested ibises were found to prefer to fly over the railway bridge (89.29% of
the total crossing activities observed for this species). Egrets were more
likely to cross the railway below the bridge, and they accounted for 60.27% of
the total observations of crossing under the bridge. We recommend that, while
the collision risk of crested ibises could be low, barrier-like structures,
such as fences, should still be considered to promote the conservation of
multiple bird species in the area. This paper provides a practical case for
railway ecology studies in China. To our best knowledge, this is the first
high-speed railway project that takes protecting crested ibises as one of the
top priorities, and exemplifies the recent nationwide initiative towards the
construction of ""eco-civilization"" in the country.

outset of the latter event is shown to be dictated by the interplay of highly

intense electron-hole pair scatterings due to electron-phonon coupling are
inducing phonon linewidth modifications as a function of doping. Comprehending
these intricate dynamical effects turns out to be a key for mastering

density, the crystalline state melts into a high-density hexatic state devoid

and introduce plasticity in the system, nevertheless maintaining the hexatic

constants of active solids are equal to those of their passive counterparts, as
the swim contribution to the stress tensor is negligible in the solid state.
The sole effect of activity is that the stable solid regime shifts to higher

The transport of all these magnetic objects is achieved by moving an external

the particles as we continuously scan through a family of modulation loops. The
direction and the type of transport is characterized by the winding numbers of
the modulation loops around special objects in control space, which is the
space of possible directions of the external magnetic field. The number of
winding numbers necessary for characterizing the topological transport
increases with the number of particles per unit cell. The topological character
of the transport is destroyed when transporting a large collection of particles
per unit cell like it is the case for a macroscopic assembly of magnetic nano
particles in a ferrofluid droplet for which the transport is geometrical and no

winds is theoretically puzzling, since the destruction time of cold gas is much
smaller than its acceleration time. In previous work, we showed that cold gas
can accelerate to wind speeds and grow in mass if the radiative cooling time of
mixed gas is shorter than the cloud destruction time. Here, we study this
process in much more detail, and find remarkably robust cloud acceleration and
growth in a wide variety of scenarios. Radiative cooling, rather than the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, enables self-sustaining entrainment of hot gas
onto the cloud via cooling-induced pressure gradients. Indeed, growth peaks
when the cloud is almost co-moving. The entrainment velocity is of order the
cold gas sound speed, and growth is accompanied by cloud pulsations. Growth is
also robust to the background wind and initial cloud geometry. In an adiabatic
Chevalier-Clegg type wind, for instance, the mass growth rate is constant.
Although growth rates are similar with magnetic fields, cloud morphology
changes dramatically, with low density, magnetically supported filaments which
have a small mass fraction but dominate by volume. This could bias absorption
line observations. Cloud growth from entraining and cooling hot gas can
potentially account for the cold gas content of the CGM. It can also fuel star
formation in the disk as cold gas recycled in a galactic fountain accretes and
cools halo gas. We speculate that galaxy-scale simulations should converge in
cold gas mass once cloud column densities of ${\rm N} \sim 10^{18} \ {\rm
cm^{-2}}$ are resolved.

superconducting qubits, leading to both dissipation of the qubit energy and
dephasing. Recently, it has been shown that normal-metal traps may efficiently
reduce the quasiparticle population and improve the qubit lifetime, provided
the trap surpasses a certain characteristic size. Moreover, while the trap
itself introduces new relaxation mechanisms, they are not expected to harm
state-of-the-art transmon qubits under the condition that the traps are not
placed too close to extremal positions where electric fields are high. Here, we
study a different type of trap, realized through gap engineering. We find that
gap-engineered traps relax the remaining constraints imposed on normal metal
traps. Firstly, the characteristic trap size, above which the trap is
efficient, is reduced with respect to normal metal traps, such that here,
strong traps are possible in smaller devices. Secondly, the losses caused by
the trap are now greatly reduced, providing more flexibility in trap placement.
The latter point is of particular importance, since for efficient protection
from quasiparticles, the traps ideally should be placed close to the active
parts of the qubit device, where electric fields are typically high.

Lyapunov function is used in the study of the prelimit and diffusion limit.
  A parameter called the spare capacity (safety staffing) of the network plays
a central role in characterizing the stability results: the parameter being
positive is necessary and sufficient that the limiting diffusion is uniformly
exponentially ergodic over all stationary Markov controls. We introduce the
concept of ""system-wide work conserving policies"", which are defined as
policies that minimize the number of idle servers at all times. This is
stronger than the so-called joint work conservation. We show that, provided the
spare capacity parameter is positive, the diffusion-scaled processes are
geometrically ergodic and the invariant distributions are tight, uniformly over
all ""system-wide work conserving policies"". In addition, when the spare
capacity is negative we show that the diffusion-scaled processes are transient

generally performed to enforce the best design and implementation practices or
to cope with design defects. Several studies attempted to detect refactoring
activities through mining software repositories allowing to collect, analyze
and get actionable data-driven insights about refactoring practices within
software projects. Aim. We aim at identifying, among the various quality models
presented in the literature, the ones that are more in-line with the
developer's vision of quality optimization, when they explicitly mention that
they are refactoring to improve them. Method. We extract a large corpus of
design-related refactoring activities that are applied and documented by
developers during their daily changes from 3,795 curated open source Java
projects. In particular, we extract a large-scale corpus of structural metrics
and anti-pattern enhancement changes, from which we identify 1,245 quality
improvement commits with their corresponding refactoring operations, as
perceived by software engineers. Thereafter, we empirically analyze the impact
of these refactoring operations on a set of common state-of-the-art design
quality metrics. Results. The statistical analysis of the obtained results
shows that (i) a few state-of-the-art metrics are more popular than others; and
(ii) some metrics are being more emphasized than others. Conclusions. We verify
that there are a variety of structural metrics that can represent the internal
quality attributes with different degrees of improvement and degradation of
software quality. Most of the metrics that are mapped to the main quality
attributes do capture developer intentions of quality improvement reported in
the commit messages.

Through the combination of sampling-based planning, a Rapidly Exploring
Randomized Tree (RRT) and an efficient kinodynamic motion planner through
machine learning, we propose an efficient solution to long-range planning for
kinodynamic motion planning. First, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn
an obstacle-avoiding policy that maps a robot's sensor observations to actions,
which is used as a local planner during planning and as a controller during
execution. Second, we train a reachability estimator in a supervised manner,
which predicts the RL policy's time to reach a state in the presence of
obstacles. Lastly, we introduce RL-RRT that uses the RL policy as a local
planner, and the reachability estimator as the distance function to bias
tree-growth towards promising regions. We evaluate our method on three
kinodynamic systems, including physical robot experiments. Results across all
three robots tested indicate that RL-RRT outperforms state of the art
kinodynamic planners in efficiency, and also provides a shorter path finish
time than a steering function free method. The learned local planner policy and
accompanying reachability estimator demonstrate transferability to the
previously unseen experimental environments, making RL-RRT fast because the
expensive computations are replaced with simple neural network inference.

While nine of the discs appear to be unstable to perturbations from their host
binary based on a simple analysis of their inferred radii, we argue that the
evidence for genuine instability is not strong, primarily because of
uncertainty in the true disc radii, uncertainty in the boundaries of the
unstable regions, and orbital projection effects. The binary separation
distributions of the disc-bearing and disc-free systems are different at a
confidence level of $99.4\%$, indicating that binary separation strongly
influences the presence of detectable levels of debris. No discs are detected
for separations between $\sim$25 and 135 au; this is likely a result of
binaries whose separations are comparable with typical disc radii clearing out
their primordial circumstellar or circumbinary material via dynamical
perturbations. The disc detection rate is $19^{+5}_{-3}\%$ for binaries wider
than 135 au, similar to published results for single stars. Only
$8^{+2}_{-1}\%$ of systems with separations below 25 au host a detectable disc,
which may suggest that planetesimal formation is inhibited in binaries closer

effect of an intervention on a given outcome. In the absence of a randomized
experiment, many methods such as stratification and inverse propensity
weighting have been proposed to estimate ACE. However, it is hard to know which
method is optimal for a given dataset or which hyperparameters to use for a
chosen method. To this end, we provide a framework to characterize the loss of
a causal inference method against the true ACE, by framing causal inference as
a representation learning problem. We show that many popular methods, including
back-door methods can be considered as weighting or representation learning
algorithms, and provide general error bounds for their causal estimates. In
addition, we consider the case when unobserved variables can confound the
causal estimate and extend proposed bounds using principles of robust
statistics, considering confounding as contamination under the Huber
contamination model. These bounds are also estimable; as an example, we provide
empirical bounds for the Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW) estimator and show
how the bounds can be used to optimize the threshold of clipping extreme
propensity scores. Our work provides a new way to reason about competing
estimators, and opens up the potential of deriving new methods by minimizing
the proposed error bounds.

reference frame is re-examined at the quantum level. By using a quantum
non-linear sigma model (Q-NLSM), a theory of quantum spacetime reference frame
(QSRF) is proposed. The underlying mathematical structure is a new geometry
endowed with intrinsic 2nd central moment (variance) or even higher moments of
its coordinates, which generalizes the classical Riemannian geometry based on
only 1st moment (mean) of its coordinates. The 2nd central moment of the
coordinates directly modifies the quadratic form distance which is the
foundation of the Riemannian geometry. At semi-classical level, the 2nd central
moment introduces a flow which continuously deforms the Riemannian geometry
driven by its classical Ricci curvature, which is known as the Ricci flow. A
generalized equivalence principle of quantum version is also proposed to
interpret the new geometry endowed with at least 2nd moment. As a consequence,
the spacetime is stabilized against quantum fluctuation, and the cosmological
constant problem is resolved within the framework. With an isotropic positive
curvature initial condition, the long flow time solution of the Ricci flow
exists, the accelerating expansion universe at cosmic scale is an observable
effect of the spacetime deformation of the normalized Ricci flow. A
deceleration parameter -0.67 consistent with measurement is obtained by using
the reduced volume method introduced by Perelman. Effective theory of gravity

the presence of life on Earth. This widespread pigmentation that could not be
explained by geological processes alone, is caused by the cellular structure of
vegetation - a mechanism for potentially limiting damage to chlorophyll and/or
limiting water loss. The distinctive increase in the red portion of Earth's
global reflectance spectrum is called the vegetation red edge in astrobiology
literature and is one of the proposed surface biosignatures to search for on
exoplanets and exomoons. Earth's surface vegetation has only been widespread
for about half a billion years, providing a surface biosignature for
approximately 1/9th our planet's lifetime. However, as chlorophyll is present
in many forms of life on Earth, like cyanobacteria, algae, lichen, corals, as
well as leafy vegetation, such a spectral red edge feature could indicate a
wide range of life, expanding its use for the search for surface biosignatures
beyond vegetation alone to a time long before vegetation became widespread on
Earth. We show how lichens could extend the presence of Earth's red edge

elastic obstacle which is immersed in a homogeneous acoustic medium. This paper
concerns an inverse acoustic-elastic interaction problem, which is to determine
the location and shape of the elastic obstacle by using either the phased or
phaseless far-field data. By introducing the Helmholtz decomposition, the model
problem is reduced to a coupled boundary value problem of the Helmholtz
equations. The jump relations are studied for the second derivatives of the
single-layer potential in order to establish the corresponding boundary
integral equations. The well-posedness is discussed for the solution of the
coupled boundary integral equations. An efficient and high order
Nystr\""{o}m-type discretization method is proposed for the integral system. A
numerical method of nonlinear integral equations is developed for the inverse
problem. For the case of phaseless data, we show that the modulus of the
far-field pattern is invariant under a translation of the obstacle. To break
the translation invariance, an elastic reference ball technique is introduced.
We prove that the inverse problem with phaseless far-field pattern has a unique
solution under certain conditions. In addition, a numerical method of the
reference ball technique based nonlinear integral equations is also proposed
for the phaseless inverse problem. Numerical experiments are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods.

multivariate time series subject to missing data. TCK is designed using an
ensemble learning approach in which Bayesian mixture models form the base
models. Because of the Bayesian approach, TCK can naturally deal with missing
values without resorting to imputation and the ensemble strategy ensures
robustness to hyperparameters, making it particularly well suited for
unsupervised learning.
  However, TCK assumes missing at random and that the underlying missingness
mechanism is ignorable, i.e. uninformative, an assumption that does not hold in
many real-world applications, such as e.g. medicine. To overcome this
limitation, we present a kernel capable of exploiting the potentially rich
information in the missing values and patterns, as well as the information from
the observed data. In our approach, we create a representation of the missing
pattern, which is incorporated into mixed mode mixture models in such a way
that the information provided by the missing patterns is effectively exploited.
Moreover, we also propose a semi-supervised kernel, capable of taking advantage
of incomplete label information to learn more accurate similarities.
  Experiments on benchmark data, as well as a real-world case study of patients
described by longitudinal electronic health record data who potentially suffer
from hospital-acquired infections, demonstrate the effectiveness of the

extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), especially by trying to find an
extraterrestrial (ET) radio signal or other technosignature in space. Yet, no
such technosignatures have been found. Considering the vastness of space,
finding such technosignatures has been described as trying to find a needle in
a cosmic haystack. To help resolve this, two hypotheses are proposed to aid
SETI researchers in narrowing the search for ET technosignatures, based on a
network analysis approach to locate where in space potential ET communication
networks would most likely be. A potential ET communication network can use
exoplanets as communication access points (e.g., placing a communication
satellite into planetary orbit, or an antenna on a planetary surface). The
approach uses a topology where exoplanets are represented as nodes, and the
lines of average distance (generalized communication paths) between adjacent
exoplanets are represented as edges; the nodes and edges form local and wide
planetary networks. Using the approach and data visualization on exoplanet
databases can highlight locations of potential ET communication networks in
space. The first hypothesis posits that an ET technosignature would more likely
appear in a potentially habitable solar system containing a high concentration
of planets, wherein the planets function as communication access points to
facilitate a potential ET communication network. The second hypothesis posits
that an ET technosignature would more likely appear in a highly concentrated
cluster of potentially habitable solar systems. Contributions to the SETI field
can be increased accuracy in finding ET technosignatures, increased accuracy in
reaching a Schelling point (a mutual realization of how we and an ET
intelligence can find each other), and promoting interdisciplinary SETI

MTDS consists of a chair bot and several expert bots. Each expert bot is

determines the final generated token by fully taking into consideration the

using large-scale numerical simulations. Particles are assumed to carry no net
charge and considered to undergo the combination of dielectrophoresis and
induced-charge electrophoresis termed dipolophoresis. Chaotic motion and
resulting hydrodynamic diffusion are known to be driven by the induced-charge
electrophoresis, which dominates the dielectrophoresis. Up to a volume fraction
$\phi \approx 35\%$, the particle dynamics seems to be hindered by the increase
in the magnitude of excluded volume interactions with concentration. However, a
non-trivial suspension behaviour is observed in concentrated regimes, where the
hydrodynamic diffusivity starts to increase with a volume fraction at $\phi
\approx 35\%$ before reaching a local maximum and then drastically decreases as
approaching random close packing. Similar non-trivial behaviours are observed
in the particle velocity and number-density fluctuations around volume
fractions that the non-trivial behaviour of the hydrodynamic diffusion is
observed. We explain these non-trivial behaviours as a consequence of particle
contacts, which are related to the dominant mechanism of particle pairings. The
particle contacts are classified into attractive and repulsive classes by the
nature of contacts, and in particular, the strong repulsive contact becomes
predominant at $\phi > 20\%$. Moreover, this transition is visible in the pair
distribution functions, which also reveal the change in the suspension
microstructure in concentrated regimes. It appears that strong and massive
repulsive contacts along the direction perpendicular to an electric field
promote the non-trivial suspension behaviours observed in concentrated regimes.

a fixed volume consisting of different compositions of ethanol-water binary
mixture at different substrate temperatures (T_s). At T_s=25oC, we observe
pinned-stage linear evaporation for pure droplets, but a binary droplet
undergoes two distinct evaporation stages: an early pinned stage and a later
receding stage. In the binary droplet, the more volatile ethanol, evaporates
faster leading to a nonlinear trend in the evaporation process at the early
stage. The phenomenon observed in the present study at T_s=25oC is similar to
that presented by previous researchers at room temperature. More interesting
dynamics is observed in the evaporation process of a binary droplet at an
elevated substrate temperature. We found that the lifetime of the droplet
exhibits a non-monotonic trend with the increase in ethanol concentration in
the binary mixture, which {can be attributed to} the non-ideal behaviour of
water-ethanol binary mixtures. Increasing T_s decreases the lifetime of the
(50\% ethanol + 50 \% water) binary droplet in a logarithmic scale. For this
composition, at T_s=60oC, we observed an early spreading stage, an intermediate
pinned stage and a late receding stage of evaporation. Unlike T_s=25oC, at the
early times of the evaporation process, the contact angle of the droplet of
pure water at T_s=60oC is greater than 90. Late stage interfacial instability
and even droplet break-up are observed for some (though not all) binary mixture
compositions. The evaporation dynamics for different compositions at T_s=60oC
exhibit a self-similar trend. Finally, the evaporation rates of pure and binary
droplets at different substrate temperatures are compared against a theoretical
model developed for pure and binary mixture droplets.

constrains the correlation functional to behave in a consistent way under

the $n$-partite information (NPI), of which the \textit{total correlation} and

found to be uniquely capable of determining whether a certain class of
inferential transformations, $\rho\xrightarrow{*}\rho'$, preserve, destroy or

possible global correlation quantifiers. Finally, the derivation and results
allow us to quantify non-binary notions of statistical sufficency. Our results
express what percentage of the correlations are preserved under a given

matter (DM) halo. As the Sun goes through this halo, it excites a DM wake
behind it. This local asymmetry in the DM distribution would gravitationally
affect the motions of Solar System planets, potentially allowing the DM wake to
be detected or ruled out. Hernandez (2019) recently calculated that the
DM-induced perturbation to Saturn's position is 252 metres net of the effect on
the Sun. No such anomaly is seen in Saturn's motion despite very accurate
tracking of the Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn for >13 years. Here,
we revisit the calculation of how much Saturn would deviate from Keplerian
motion if we fix its position and velocity at some particular time. The DM wake
induces a nearly resonant perturbation whose amplitude grows almost linearly
with time. We show that the Hernandez (2019) result applies only for an
observing duration comparable to the ${\approx 250}$ million year period of the
Sun's orbit around the Galaxy. Over a 100 year period, the perturbation to
Saturn's orbit amounts to <1 cm, which is quite consistent with existing
observations. Even smaller perturbations are expected for the terrestrial

vanishing for rigid rotation. In the sense of a nondiffusive $\Lambda$ effect,
however, even for {\em rigidly} rotating $z$-pinches an axisymmetric angular
momentum flux appears which is directed outward (inward) for large (small)

thus never be uniform. Those particular rotation laws are used to estimate the
value of the instability-induced eddy viscosity for which the nondiffusive

NCEP/NCAR reanalysis fields. Downscaling experiments are performed over a
one-month period in January, 2016. The similarity metric is used to evaluate
the performance of the downscaling methods for large and small scales.
Similarity results are compared for the outputs of the WRF model with different
downscaling techniques, NCEP reanalysis, and Final Analysis. Both spectral
nudging and CDA describe better the small-scale features compared to grid
nudging. The choice of the wave number is critical in spectral nudging;
increasing the number of retained frequencies generally produced better
small-scale features, but only up to a certain threshold after which its
solution gradually became closer to grid nudging. CDA maintains the balance of
the large- and small-scale features similar to that of the best simulation
achieved by the best spectral nudging configuration, without the need of a
spectral decomposition. The different downscaled atmospheric variables,
including rainfall distribution, with CDA is most consistent with the
observations. The Brier skill score values further indicate that the added
value of CDA is distributed over the entire model domain. The overall results
clearly suggest that CDA provides an efficient new approach for dynamical

for synthetic images, which can effectively reduce the cost of human and
material resources. However, due to the different distribution of synthetic
images compared to real images, the desired performance cannot be achieved.
Real images consist of multiple forms of light orientation, while synthetic
images consist of a uniform light orientation. These features are considered to
be characteristic of outdoor and indoor scenes, respectively. To solve this
problem, the previous method learned a model to improve the realism of the
synthetic image. Different from the previous methods, this paper try to purify
real image by extracting discriminative and robust features to convert outdoor
real images to indoor synthetic images. In this paper, we first introduce the
segmentation masks to construct RGB-mask pairs as inputs, then we design a
attention-guided style transfer network to learn style features separately from
the attention and bkgd(background) region , learn content features from full
and attention region. Moreover, we propose a novel region-level task-guided
loss to restrain the features learnt from style and content. Experiments were
performed using mixed studies (qualitative and quantitative) methods to
demonstrate the possibility of purifying real images in complex directions. We
evaluate the proposed method on three public datasets, including LPW, COCO and
MPIIGaze. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is
effective and achieves the state-of-the-art results.
