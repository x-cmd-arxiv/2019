irreversibility, quantified by the entropy production, carries two energetic
footprints: the reduction of extractable work from the optimal, reversible
case, and the generation of a surplus of heat that is irreversibly dissipated
to the environment. Recently it has been shown that in the quantum regime an
additional quantum irreversibility occurs that is linked to decoherence into
the energy basis. Here we employ quantum trajectories to construct
distributions for classical heat and quantum heat exchanges, and show that the
heat footprint of quantum irreversibility differs markedly from the classical
case. We also quantify how quantum irreversibility reduces the amount of work
that can be extracted from a state with coherences. Our results show that
decoherence leads to both entropic and energetic footprints which both play an
important role in the optimization of controlled quantum operations at low
temperature.

  Responsive Survey Design: Historical Data Analysis vs. Literature Review","42 pages, 9 figures, one table",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Responsive Survey Design (RSD) aims to increase the efficiency of survey data
collection via live monitoring of paradata and the introduction of protocol
changes when survey errors and increased costs seem imminent. Daily predictions
of response propensity for all active sampled cases are among the most
important quantities for live monitoring of data collection outcomes, making
sound predictions of these propensities essential for the success of RSD.
Because it relies on real-time updates of prior beliefs about key design
quantities, such as predicted response propensities, RSD stands to benefit from
Bayesian approaches. However, empirical evidence of the merits of these
approaches is lacking in the literature, and the derivation of informative
prior distributions is required for these approaches to be effective. In this
paper, we evaluate the ability of two approaches to deriving prior
distributions for the coefficients defining daily response propensity models to
improve predictions of daily response propensity in a real data collection
employing RSD. The first approach involves analyses of historical data from the
same survey, and the second approach involves literature review. We find that
Bayesian methods based on these two approaches result in higher-quality
predictions of response propensity than more standard approaches ignoring prior
information. This is especially true during the early-to-middle periods of data
collection when interventions are often considered in an RSD framework.

able to provide various types of services including tracking of health and
fitness, making financial transactions, and unlocking smart locks and vehicles.
Most of these services are delivered based on users' confidential and personal
data, which are stored on these wearables. Existing explicit authentication
approaches (i.e., PINs or pattern locks) for wearables suffer from several
limitations, including small or no displays, risk of shoulder surfing, and
users' recall burden. Oftentimes, users completely disable security features
out of convenience. Therefore, there is a need for a burden-free (implicit)
authentication mechanism for wearable device users based on easily obtainable
biometric data. In this paper, we present an implicit wearable device user
authentication mechanism using combinations of three types of coarse-grain
minute-level biometrics: behavioral (step counts), physiological (heart rate),
and hybrid (calorie burn and metabolic equivalent of task). From our analysis
of over 400 Fitbit users from a 17-month long health study, we are able to
authenticate subjects with average accuracy values of around .93 (sedentary)

than other biometrics and behavioral biometrics do not have a significant

estimation in tumor growth models for glioblastomas, a form of aggressive

differential equation (PDE) for the tumor concentration. We use a
PDE-constrained optimization formulation for the inverse problem. The unknown
parameters are the reaction coefficient (proliferation), the diffusion
coefficient (infiltration), and the initial condition field for the tumor PDE.
Segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans from a single time
snapshot drive the inverse problem where segmented tumor regions serve as
partial observations of the tumor concentration. The precise time relative to
tumor initiation is unknown, which poses an additional difficulty for
inversion. We perform a frozen-coefficient spectral analysis and show that the
inverse problem is severely ill-posed. We introduce a biophysically motivated
regularization on the tumor initial condition. In particular, we assume that
the tumor starts at a few locations (enforced with a sparsity constraint) and
that the initial condition magnitude in the maximum norm equals one. We solve
the resulting optimization problem using an inexact quasi-Newton method
combined with a compressive sampling algorithm for the sparsity constraint. Our
implementation uses PETSc and AccFFT libraries. We conduct numerical
experiments on synthetic and clinical images to highlight the improved
performance of our solver over an existing solver that uses a two-norm
regularization for the calibration parameters. The existing solver is unable to
localize the initial condition. Our new solver can localize the initial
condition and recover infiltration and proliferation. In clinical datasets (for

different solutions compared to the existing solver.

extends the notion of fresh updates to that of fresh ""informative"" updates. The

information to the monitor side. After properly motivating the new metric, and
with the aim of minimizing its average, we formulate a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) in a transmitter-receiver pair scenario where packets are sent over an
unreliable channel. We show that a simple ""always update"" policy minimizes the
aforementioned average penalty along with the average age and prediction error.
We then tackle the general, and more realistic case, where the transmitter
cannot surpass a specific power budget. The problem is formulated as a
Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) for which we provide a Lagrangian
approach to solve. After characterizing the optimal transmission policy of the
Lagrangian problem, we provide a rigorous mathematical proof to showcase that a
mixture of two Lagrange policies is optimal for the CMDP in question. Equipped
with this, we provide a low complexity algorithm that finds the AoII-optimal
operating point of the system in the constrained scenario. Lastly, simulation
results are laid out to showcase the performance of the proposed policy and

including the time delay between images, are used to decrease uncertainties in
the lens model, including the the slope of the projected surface density of the
lens galaxy, $\Sigma\propto r^{1-\eta}$, and to constrain the universal
expansion rate $H_0$. Imaging with HST provides an upper limit on the slope
$\eta$, in slight tension with the steeper density profiles indicated by
imaging with Keck after iPTF16geu had faded, potentially due to dust extinction
not corrected for in host galaxy imaging. Since smaller $\eta$ implies larger
magnifications, we take advantage of the standard candle nature of Type Ia
supernovae constraining the image magnifications, to obtain an independent
constraint of the slope. We find that a smooth lens density fails to explain
the iPTF16geu fluxes, regardless of the slope, and additional sub-structure
lensing is needed. The total probability for the smooth halo model combined
with star microlensing to explain the iPTF16geu image fluxes is maximized at
$12\,\%$ for $\eta\sim 1.8$, in excellent agreement with Keck high spatial
resolution data, and flatter than an isothermal halo. It also agrees perfectly
with independent constraints on the slope from lens velocity dispersion
measurements. Combining with the observed time delays between the images, we
infer a lower bound on the Hubble constant, $H_0 \gtrsim 40\,{\rm km \ s^{-1}

based on local spin density approximation (LSDA) for the density functional
theory (DFT) suggest that the Co magnetic moment strongly depends on the
directions of the surrounding magnetic moments, which usually indicates the
Stoner-type mechanism of magnetism. This is consistent with the disordered
local moment (DLM) picture of the paramagnetic state, where the magnetic moment
of cobalt gets substantially suppressed. We argue that this is due to the lack
of strong on-site electron correlations, which we take into account by
employing a combination of DFT and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Within
LDA+DMFT, we find a substantial quasiparticle mass renormalization and a non
Fermi-liquid behaviour of Fe-$3d$ orbitals. The resulting spectral functions
are in very good agreement with measured spin-resolved photoemission spectra.
Our results suggest that local correlations play an essential role in
stabilizing a robust local moment on Co in the absence of magnetic order at

Statokinesigrams, after appropriate signal processing, can offer numerous

PSF or PSNF based on clinical assessment and underwent simple Romberg Test

multiple testing with p-value adjustment and the ts-AUC. While the ts-AUC
showed significant difference between groups (p-value = 0.01), multiple testing
did not show any such difference. Interestingly, significant difference between
the two groups was found only using the open-eyes protocol. PSF showed
significantly increased antero-posterior movements as well as increased
posturographic area, compared to PSNF. Our study demonstrates the superiority
of the ts-AUC test compared to standard statistical tools in distinguishing PSF

  Nuclear Medicine","42 pages, 11 figures, part of a PhD thesis",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Currently, there is a high interest in Lu-177 targeted radionuclide
therapies, which could be attributed to favourable results obtained from Lu-177
compounds targeting neuroendocrine and prostate tumours. Generally, it has been
recognized that a transition from dosimetry based on planar images towards
based on fully-quantitative SPECT is beneficial in terms of increased accuracy.
SPECT based dosimetry could not only be used for achieving accurate absorbed
dose per-organ, but even for deriving dose values for individual voxels.
However, a voxel-wise determination of TACs is problematic since several
confounding factors exist, such as e.g. poor count-statistics or registration
inaccuracies. A particle filter (PF) is a class of methods which applies
regularization based on a model of a state's evolution over time. We applied
PFs for de-noising the TACs of 26 patients, who underwent Lu-177-DOTATOC or
-PSMA therapy. The TACs were obtained from four serial SPECT(/CT) data. The
model used in the PF was a mono-exponential decay. The time-integrated
activities (TIA) resulting from the PF were compared to the results of a
monoexponential fit of the individual voxels in several volumes of interest.
Optimal values for noise of observations and noise of the model were 0.25 and
0.5, respectively. The distribution of voxel-wise halflives resulting from the
PFFit method were considerably closer to the organ average value and the number
of implausibly long halflives was reduced. However, one has to admit that
voxel-wise fitting generally lead to considerable deviations from the
organ-average TIA as obtained by conventional whole-organ evaluation.
Unfortunately, we did not have ground-truth TIA of our patient data and proper
ground-truth could even be impossible to obtain. Nevertheless, there are strong
indicators that Particle Filtering can be used for reducing voxel-wise TAC
noise.

unknown origin [1,2]. Their dispersion measures, which quantify the observed
frequency-dependent dispersive delays in terms of free-electron column
densities, significantly exceed predictions from models [3] of the Milky Way
interstellar medium. The excess dispersions are likely accrued as fast radio
bursts propagate through their host galaxies, gaseous galactic halos and the
intergalactic medium [4,5]. Despite extensive follow-up observations of the
published sample of 72 burst sources [6], only two are observed to repeat
[7,8], and it is unknown whether or not the remainder are truly one-off events.
Here I show that the volumetric occurrence rate of so far non-repeating fast
radio bursts likely exceeds the rates of candidate cataclysmic progenitor
events, and also likely exceeds the birth rates of candidate compact-object
sources. This analysis is based on the high detection rate of bursts with low
dispersion measures by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment [9].
Within the existing suite of astrophysical scenarios for fast radio burst
progenitors, I conclude that most observed cases originate from sources that
emit several bursts over their lifetimes.

the number of fictitious applications sent to each job ad. These moments are
used to bound the fraction of jobs that illegally discriminate. Applying our
results to three experimental datasets, we find evidence of significant
employer heterogeneity in discriminatory behavior, with the standard deviation
of gaps in job-specific callback probabilities across protected groups
averaging roughly twice the mean gap. In a recent experiment manipulating
racially distinctive names, we estimate that at least 85% of jobs that contact
both of two white applications and neither of two black applications are
engaged in illegal discrimination. To assess the tradeoff between type I and II
errors presented by these patterns, we consider the performance of a series of
decision rules for investigating suspicious callback behavior under a simple
two-type model that rationalizes the experimental data. Though, in our
preferred specification, only 17% of employers are estimated to discriminate on
the basis of race, we find that an experiment sending 10 applications to each

accusing fewer than 0.2% of non-discriminators. A minimax decision rule
acknowledging partial identification of the joint distribution of callback

capture alterations caused by AD at different anatomical levels. Based on a
cascade of classifiers, this multiscale approach enables the analysis of
alterations of whole brain structures and hippocampus subfields at the same
time. During our experiments using the ADNI-1 dataset, the proposed multiscale
graph-based grading method obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 81% to
predict conversion of MCI subjects to AD within three years. Moreover, when
combined with cognitive scores, the proposed method obtained 85% of AUC. These
results are competitive in comparison to state-of-the-art methods evaluated on

that the most likely scenarios to explain the observed activity on Gault were
rotational excitation or merger of near-contact binaries. Here we use new
photometric and spectroscopic data of Gault to determine its physical and
compositional properties. Lightcurves derived from the photometric data showed
little variation over three nights of observations, which prevented us from
determining the rotation period of the asteroid. Using WISE observations of
Gault and the near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM) we determined that this
asteroid has a diameter $<$6 km. NIR spectroscopic data obtained with the
Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) showed a spectrum similar to that of
S-complex asteroids, and a surface composition consistent with H chondrite

the external environment. In terms of the environmental role, we still do not
have a clear picture of the processes driving the transformation of galaxies.
The use of proxies for environment (e.g., host halo mass, distance to the N^th
nearest neighbour, etc.), as opposed to the real physical conditions (e.g., hot
gas density) may bear some responsibility for this. Here we propose a new
method that directly links galaxies to their local environments, by using
spatial cross-correlations of galaxy catalogues with maps from large-scale
structure surveys (e.g., thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich [tSZ] effect, diffuse X-ray
emission, weak lensing of galaxies or the CMB). We focus here on the quenching
of galaxies and its link to local hot gas properties. Maps of galaxy
overdensity and quenched fraction excess are constructed from volume-limited
SDSS catalogs, which are cross-correlated with tSZ effect and X-ray maps from
Planck and ROSAT, respectively. Strong signals out to Mpc scales are detected
for most cross-correlations and are compared to predictions from the EAGLE and
BAHAMAS cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The simulations successfully
reproduce many, but not all, of the observed power spectra, with an indication
that environmental quenching may be too efficient in the simulations. We
demonstrate that the cross-correlations are sensitive to both the internal
(e.g., AGN and stellar feedback) and external processes (e.g., ram pressure
stripping, harassment, strangulation, etc.) responsible for quenching. The
methods outlined in this paper can be adapted to other observables and, with
upcoming surveys, will provide a stringent test of physical models for
environmental transformation.

from two-dimensional gauge theories with connected gauge groups to the case of
O(k) gauge groups with discrete theta angles. We check our proposed extension
by counting and comparing vacua in mirrors to known dual two-dimensional
(S)O(k) gauge theories. The mirrors in question are Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds,
and for mirrors to O(k) gauge theories, the critical loci of the mirror
superpotential often intersect fixed-point loci, so that to count vacua, one
must take into account twisted sector contributions. This is a technical
novelty relative to mirrors of gauge theories with connected gauge groups, for
which critical loci do not intersect fixed-point loci and so no orbifold
twisted sector contributions are pertinent. The vacuum computations turn out to
be a rather intricate test of the proposed mirrors, in particular as untwisted
sector states in the mirror to one theory are often exchanged with twisted
sector states in the mirror to the dual. In cases with nontrivial IR limits, we
also check that central charges computed from the Landau-Ginzburg mirrors match
those expected for the IR SCFTs.

of the galaxy's inner-bar and active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find
correlations between the 89 $\mu$m magnetic field vectors and other tracers of

azimuthal angle arising from the projection and inclination of the disk field
component in the plane of the sky. The observations can be fit with a
logarithmic spiral model with pitch angle of $16.9^{+2.7}_{-2.8}$$^{\circ}$ and
a disk inclination of $48\pm2^{\circ}$. We infer that the bulk of the
interstellar medium from which the polarized dust emission originates is
threaded by a magnetic field that closely follows the spiral arms. Inside the
central starburst disk ($<1.6$ kpc), the degree of polarization is found to be
lower than for far-infrared sources in the Milky Way, and has minima at the
locations of most intense star formation near the outer ends of the inner-bar.
Inside the starburst ring, the field direction deviates from the model,
becoming more radial along the leading edges of the inner-bar. The polarized
flux and dust temperature peak $\sim 3-6$"" NE of the AGN at the location of a
bow shock between the AGN outflow and the surrounding interstellar medium, but
the AGN itself is weakly polarized ($< 1$%) at both 53 and 89 \um.

more than 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass (Mstar), star-formation rate

mechanisms in order to remain compatible with existing tests of gravity. The
screening is less efficient in underdense regions, which suggests that cosmic
voids can be a useful cosmological probe for constraining modified gravity
models. In particular, weak lensing by voids has been proposed as a promising
test of such theories. Usually, voids are identified from galaxy distributions,
making them biased tracers of the underlying matter field. An alternative
approach is to study voids identified in weak lensing maps -- weak lensing
voids -- which have been shown to better correspond to true underdense regions.
In this paper, we study the ability of weak lensing voids to detect the
signatures of modified gravity. Focusing on the void abundance and weak lensing
profiles, we find that both statistics are sensitive probes of gravity. These
are quantified in terms of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) with which an
LSST-like survey will be able to distinguish between different gravity models.
We find that the tangential shear profiles of weak lensing voids are
considerably better than galaxy voids at this, though voids have somewhat lower
SNR than weak lensing peaks. The abundances of voids and peaks have
respectively $\rm{SNR} = 50$ and $70$ for a popular class of modified gravity
in an LSST-like survey.

this result has important consequences for the assembly of planetary systems by
giants collisions and their long-term evolution, this underlying exponential

on orbital diffusion have only yielded power-law scalings. We propose a
different picture, where large deviations of the system from its initial

that the survival time of the system $T$ can be estimated using a heuristic
motivated by Nekhoroshev's theorem, and obtain a formula for systems away from

matter self-interaction rate increasing with time gives a novel way of
reconciling the large self interactions required to address small scale
structure issues with the constraint coming from clusters. Next, we study the
effects of kinetic mixing variation during the radiation dominated era on
freeze-in dark matter production. Last, we elucidate quintessence effects on
the restoration of the electroweak symmetry at finite temperature and the
lifetime of the electroweak vacuum through a modification of the effective
Higgs mass and quartic coupling.

Indeed, this connection between the Unruh effect and classical bremsstrahlung
was used recently to propose an experiment to confirm (as directly as possible)
the existence of the Unruh thermal bath. This situation may sound puzzling in
two ways: first, because the Unruh effect is a strictly quantum effect while
Larmor radiation is a classical one, and second, because of the crucial role
played by zero-frequency Rindler photons in this context. In this paper we
settle these two issues by showing how the quantum evolution leads naturally to
all relevant aspects of Larmor radiation and, especially, how the corresponding
classical radiation is entirely built from such zero-Rindler-energy modes.

unitarization methods are addressed, but each of them leads to a different

with broad Balmer lines: it is less variable, and usually does not display a
""breathing"" mode, the increase in the average cloud distance when luminosity
increases. We demonstrate that these variability properties of Mg II can be
reasonably well explained by simple Locally Optimally Emitting Cloud (LOC)
photoionization models, confirming earlier photoionization results. In the
fiducial LOC model, the Mg II-emitting gas is on average more distant from the
ionizing source than the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ gas, and responds with a lower
amplitude to continuum variations. If the broad-line region (BLR) is truncated
at a physical radius of $\sim 0.3$ pc (for a $10^{8.5}M_{\odot}$ BH accreting
at Eddington ratio of 0.1), most of the Mg II flux will always be emitted near
this outer boundary and hence will not display breathing. These results
indicate that reverberation mapping results on broad Mg II, while generally
more difficult to obtain due to the lower line responsivity, can still be used
to infer the Mg II BLR size and hence black hole mass. But it is possible that
Mg II does not have a well defined intrinsic BLR size-luminosity relation for
individual quasars, even though a global one for the general population may
still exist. The dramatic changes in broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission in the
observationally-rare changing-look quasars are fully consistent with
photoionization responses to extreme continuum variability, and the LOC model
provides natural explanations for the persistence of broad Mg II in
changing-look quasars defined on H$\alpha$/H$\beta$, and the rare population of
broad Mg II emitters in the spectra of massive inactive galaxies.

to the problem of human action recognition by incorporating the discriminative
information with SFA learning and considering the spatial relationship of body
parts. In particular, we consider four kinds of SFA learning strategies,
including the original unsupervised SFA (U-SFA), the supervised SFA (S-SFA),
the discriminative SFA (D-SFA), and the spatial discriminative SFA (SD-SFA), to
extract slow feature functions from a large amount of training cuboids which
are obtained by random sampling in motion boundaries. Afterward, to represent
action sequences, the squared first order temporal derivatives are accumulated
over all transformed cuboids into one feature vector, which is termed the
Accumulated Squared Derivative (ASD) feature. The ASD feature encodes the
statistical distribution of slow features in an action sequence. Finally, a
linear support vector machine (SVM) is trained to classify actions represented
by ASD features. We conduct extensive experiments, including two sets of
control experiments, two sets of large scale experiments on the KTH and
Weizmann databases, and two sets of experiments on the CASIA and UT-interaction
databases, to demonstrate the effectiveness of SFA for human action
recognition.

hundred seconds after the trigger time, and the MAGIC telescopes observed for
more than one thousand seconds very-high-energy (VHE) emission above 300 GeV.
Previous analysis of the multi-wavelength observations showed that although
these are consistent with the synchrotron forward-shock model that evolves from
a stratified stellar-wind to homogeneous ISM-like medium, photons above few

the synchrotron forward-shock model, we derive the light curves and spectra of

candidates were identified from optical synoptic surveys. However, they may be
false positives caused by stochastic quasar variability given the few cycles
covered (typically 1.5). To independently test the binary hypothesis, we search
for evidence of truncated or gapped circumbinary accretion discs (CBDs) in
their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Our work is motivated by CBD
simulations that predict flux deficits as cutoffs from central cavities opened
by secondaries or notches from minidiscs around both BHs. We find that
candidate periodic quasars show SEDs similar to those of control quasars
matched in redshift and luminosity. While seven of 138 candidates show a blue
cutoff in the IR-optical-UV SED, six of which may represent CBDs with central
cavities, the red SED fraction is similar to that in control quasars,
suggesting no correlation between periodicity and SED anomaly. Alternatively,
dust reddening may cause red SEDs. The fraction of extremely radio-loud
quasars, e.g., blazars (with $R>100$), is tentatively higher than that in
control quasars (at 2.5$\sigma$). Our results suggest that, assuming most
periodic candidates are robust, IR-optical-UV SEDs of CBDs are similar to those
of accretion discs of single BHs, if the periodicity is driven by BSBHs; the
higher blazar fraction may signal precessing radio jets. Alternatively, most
current candidate periodic quasars identified from few-cycle light curves may
be false positives. Their tentatively higher blazar fraction and lower
Eddington ratios may both be caused by selection biases.

millisecond pulsars (MSP) and dark matter (DM) annihilation. In the first case
the total number of MSPs needed to produce the gamma-ray flux is compatible
with the known (but not confirmed) MSP candidates observed in X-rays. A DM
interpretation is motivated by the possibility of Omega-Centauri being the
remnant core of an ancient dwarf galaxy hosting a surviving DM component. At
least two annihilation channels, light quarks and muons, can plausibly produce
the observed gama-ray spectrum. We outline constraints on the parameter space
of DM mass versus the product of the pair-annihilation cross section and
integrated squared DM density (the so-called J-factor). We translate upper
limits on the dark matter content of Omega-Centauri into lower limits on the
annihilation cross section. This shows s-wave annihilation into muons to be
inconsistent with CMB observations, while a small window for annihilation into
light quarks is allowed. Further analysis of Omega-Centauri's internal
kinematics, and/or additional information on the resident MSP population will
yield much stronger constraints and shed light about the origin of this
otherwise mysterious gamma-ray source.

advent of their photonic analogues, motivated by the prospect of
backscattering-immune light propagation. So far, however, implementations have
mainly relied on engineering bulk modes in photonic crystals and waveguide
arrays in two-dimensional systems, which closely mimic their electronic
counterparts. In addition, metamaterials-based implementations subject to
electromagnetic duality and bianisotropy conditions suffer from intricate
designs and narrow operating bandwidths. Here, it is shown that
symmetry-protected topological states akin to the quantum spin-Hall effect can
be realized in a straightforward manner by coupling surface modes over
metasurfaces of complementary electromagnetic responses. Specifically, stacking
unit cells of such metasurfaces directly results in double Dirac cones of
degenerate transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic modes, which break into
a wide non-trivial bandgap at small inter-layer separation. Consequently, the
ultrathin structure supports robust gapless edge states, which are confined
along a one-dimensional line rather than a surface interface, as demonstrated
at microwave frequencies by near field imaging. The simplicity and versatility
of the proposed approach proves attractive as a tabletop platform for the study
of classical topological phases, as well as for applications benefiting the
compactness of metasurfaces and the potential of topological insulators.

class of explosions observed following the collapse of the core of massive
stars. We use analytical estimates and population synthesis simulations to
assess the fraction of SNe II progenitors that are expected to have exchanged
mass with a companion prior to explosion. We estimate that 1/3 to 1/2 of SN II
progenitors have a history of mass exchange with a binary companion before
exploding. The dominant binary channels leading to SN II progenitors involve
the merger of binary stars. Mergers are expected to produce a diversity of SN
II progenitor characteristics, depending on the evolutionary timing and
properties of the merger. Alternatively, SN II progenitors from interacting
binaries may have accreted mass from their companion, and subsequently been
ejected from the binary system after their companion exploded. We show that the
overall fraction of SN II progenitors that are predicted to have experienced
binary interaction is robust against the main physical uncertainties in our
models. However, the relative importance of different binary evolutionary
channels is affected by changing physical assumptions. We further discuss ways
in which binarity might contribute to the observed diversity of SNe II by
considering potential observational signatures arising from each binary
channel. For supernovae which have a substantial H-rich envelope at explosion
(i.e., excluding Type IIb SNe), a surviving non-compact companion would
typically indicate that the supernova progenitor star was in a wide,
non-interacting binary. We argue that a significant fraction of even Type II-P
SNe are expected to have gained mass from a companion prior to explosion.

increasing the filling rate of containers in different practical situations.
However, the broader logistic context might pressure the loading process,
leading to sub-optimal solutions. Some facilities like cross-docks have reduced
storage space which might force early loading activities. We propose a
container loading problem which accounts for this limited storage by explicitly
considering the schedule of arrival for the boxes and the departure time of the
trucks. Also, we design a framework which handles the geometric and temporal
characteristics of the problem separately, enabling the use of methods found in
the literature for solving the extended problem. Our framework can handle
uncertainty in the schedule and be used to quantify the impact of delays on
capacity utilization and departure time of trucks.

The apparatus consists of a modified Lloyd's mirror in optics, with two

the PMIC formalism are presented. They exhibit quantum fractal structures in
space-time called `quantum carpets', first discovered by Berry (1996). The PMIC

anticipated that the verification of PMIC states by this experiment will help

that even with just two years of data, the resulting sensitivity to sources in
the southern sky is competitive with IceCube and ANTARES analyses using muon
tracks induced by charge current muon neutrino interactions - especially if the
neutrino emission follows a soft energy spectrum or originates from an extended
angular region. Here, we extend that work by adding five more years of data,
significantly improving the cascade angular resolution, and including tests for
point-like or diffuse Galactic emission to which this dataset is particularly
well-suited. For many of the signal candidates considered, this analysis is the
most sensitive of any experiment. No significant clustering was observed, and
thus many of the resulting constraints are the most stringent to date. In this
paper we will describe the improvements introduced in this analysis and discuss
our results in the context of other recent work in neutrino astronomy.

telescopes therefore play a critical and indispensable role in advancing
science. Thus, the divestment of NSF support for modest-aperture (1 - 4 m)

is compounded by the unknown consequences of the shift from observations driven
by individual investigators to survey-driven science. Given the much higher

were studied by Ramanujan. Such congruences exist only for $\ell\in\{5,7,11\}.$
Chan and Wang [4] recently studied congruences for the fractional partition
functions and gave several infinite families of congruences using identities of
the Dedekind eta-function. Following their work, we use the theory of
non-ordinary primes to find a general framework that characterizes congruences
modulo any integer. This allows us to prove new congruences such as
$p_\frac{57}{61}(17^2n-3)\equiv 0 \pmod{17^2}$.

between the SEIP source list and Gaia DR2 photometric data. Further constraints
on the proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia DR2 allowed us to remove the
foreground contamination. We estimated that about 99.5\% of the targets in our
catalog were most likely genuine members of the SMC. By using the evolutionary
tracks and synthetic photometry from MIST and the theoretical $\rm J-K_S$ color
cuts, we identified 1,405 RSG, 217 YSG and 1,369 BSG candidates in the SMC in
five different CMDs, where attention should also be paid to the incompleteness
of our sample. We ranked the candidates based on the intersection of different
CMDs. A comparison between the models and observational data shows that the
lower limit of initial mass for the RSGs population may be as low as 7 or even
6 $M_{\odot}$ and the RSG is well separated from the AGB population even at
faint magnitude, making RSGs a unique population connecting the evolved massive
and intermediate stars, since stars with initial mass around 6 to 8 $M_{\odot}$
are thought to go through a second dredge-up to become AGBs. We encourage the
interested reader to further exploit the potential of our catalog.

theory follows from group-theoretical arguments, while the gauging is
determined by the sub-algebra of generalised diffeomorphisms generated by the

pathways presumed to mediate an association. For example, we consider a study
that investigates the benefit of interventions in young adulthood for
ameliorating the poorer mid-life psychosocial outcomes of adolescent
self-harmers relative to their healthy peers. Two methodological challenges
arise. Firstly, mediation methods have hitherto mostly focused on the elusive
task of discovering pathways, rather than on the evaluation of mediator
interventions. Secondly, the complexity of such questions is invariably such
that there are no existing data on well-defined interventions (i.e. actual
treatments, programs, etc.) capturing the populations, outcomes and time-spans
of interest. Instead, researchers must rely on exposure (non-intervention) data
to address these questions, such as self-reported substance use and employment.
We address the resulting challenges by specifying a target trial addressing
three policy-relevant questions, regarding the impacts of hypothetical (rather
than actual) interventions that would shift the mediators' distributions
(separately, jointly or sequentially) to user-specified distributions that can
be emulated with the observed data. We then define novel interventional effects
that map to this trial, emulating shifts by setting mediators to random draws
from those distributions. We show that estimation using a g-computation method
is possible under an expanded set of causal assumptions relative to inference
with well-defined interventions. These expanded assumptions reflect the lower
level of evidence that is inevitable with ill-defined interventions.
Application to the self-harm example using data from the Victorian Adolescent
Health Cohort Study illustrates the value of our proposal for informing the
design and evaluation of actual interventions in the future.

as that in the two Higgs doublet models (2HDM) after the first symmetry
breaking from $SU(3)_L$ scale into the electroweak scale. For large $SU(3)_L$
scale $v_3\simeq10$ TeV, dominant one-loop contributions to the two decay
amplitudes arise from only the single charged Higgs boson predicted by the
2HDM, leading to that experimental constraint on the signal strength
$\mu^{331}_{\gamma\gamma}$ of the Standard Model-like Higgs boson decay
$h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ will result in a strict upper bound on the signal
strength $\mu^{331}_{Z\gamma}$ of the decay $h\rightarrow\, Z\gamma$. For a
particular model with lower $v_3$ around 3 TeV, contributions from heavy
charged gauge and Higgs bosons may have the same order, therefore may give
strong destructive or constructive correlations. As a by-product, a deviation
from the SM prediction $|\mu^{331}_{\gamma\gamma}-1| \le 0.04$ still allows
$|\mu^{331}_{Z\gamma}-1|$ to reach values near 0.1. We also show that there
exists an $CP$-even neutral Higgs boson $h^0_3$ predicted by the 3-3-1 models,

by energy release of $\sim$ 3000 K$\cdot$k$_B$. The second is Spin-Orbit Change
where the ion relaxes from the higher fine-structure $D_{5/2}$ level to the
lower $D_{3/2}$ level releasing $\sim$ 400 K$\cdot$k$_B$ into kinetic motion.
These processes are theoretically understood to occur through Landau-Zener
avoided crossings between the different molecular potential curves. We also
found that these relaxation rates are insensitive to the mutual spin
orientation of the ion and atoms. This is explained by the strong inertial
Coriolis coupling present in ultracold atom-ion collisions due to the high
partial wave involved, which strongly mixes different angular momentum states.
This inertial coupling explains the loss of the total electronic
angular-momentum which is transferred to the external rotation of nuclei. Our
results provide deeper understanding of ultracold atom-ion inelastic collisions
and offer additional quantum control tools for the cold chemistry field.

nuclear beta decays (also known as ``inner'' corrections) are revisited in
light of a recent dispersion relation study that found $+2.467(22)\%$,
i.e.~about $2.4\sigma$ larger than the previous evaluation. For comparison, we
consider several alternative computational methods. All employ an updated
perturbative QCD four-loop Bjorken sum rule (BjSR) defined QCD coupling
supplemented with a nucleon form factor based Born amplitude to estimate
axial-vector induced hadronic contributions. In addition, we now include
hadronic contributions from low $Q^2$ loop effects based on duality
considerations and vector meson resonance interpolators. Our primary result,
$2.426(32)\%$ corresponds to an average of a Light Front Holomorphic QCD
approach and a three resonance interpolator fit. It reduces the dispersion
relation discrepancy to approximately $1.1\sigma$ and thereby provides a
consistency check. Consequences of our new radiative correction estimate, along
with that of the dispersion relation result, for CKM unitarity are discussed.
The neutron lifetime-$g_A$ connection is updated and shown to suggest a shorter
neutron lifetime $< 879$ s. We also find an improved bound on exotic,
non-Standard Model, neutron decays or oscillations of the type conjectured as
solutions to the neutron lifetime problem, $\text{BR}(n\to \text{exotics}) <

In this
paper, we algorithmically determine when the moduli space of semistable sheaves
$M_{X,H}(r,c_1,c_2)$ is nonempty. Our algorithm relies on certain stacks of
prioritary sheaves. We first solve the existence problem for these stacks and
then algorithmically determine the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of the general
sheaf in the stack. In particular, semistable sheaves exist if and only if the
Harder-Narasimhan filtration has length one.
  We then study sharp Bogomolov inequalities $\Delta \geq \delta_H(c_1/r)$ for
the discriminants of stable sheaves which take the polarization and slope into
account; these inequalities essentially completely describe the characters of
stable sheaves. The function $\delta_H(c_1/r)$ can be computed to arbitrary
precision by a limiting procedure. In the case of an anticanonically polarized
del Pezzo surface, exceptional bundles are always stable and $\delta_H(c_1/r)$
is computed by exceptional bundles. More generally, we show that for an
arbitrary polarization there are further necessary conditions for the existence
of stable sheaves beyond those provided by stable exceptional bundles. We
compute $\delta_H(c_1/r)$ exactly in some of these cases. Finally, solutions to
the existence problem have immediate applications to the birational geometry of
moduli spaces of sheaves.

$1 \times 1$ slidable particles that can be reconfigured to build any $h \times

weakly universal configuration that can build any $h \times w$-bounded size

strongly universal configuration which can assemble any shape within a
previously studied ``drop'' class, while using quadratically less space than
previous results.

by any particle (occupancy problem), deciding if a specific particle may be
relocated to another position (relocation problem), and deciding if a given

Particular attention is directed to additional insight that the late-phase data
provide. The nebular spectra show forbidden lines of oxygen and calcium,
elements that are usually not seen in late-time spectra of SNe Ia, while the
ionisation state of the emitting iron plasma is low, pointing to low ejecta
temperatures and high densities. The optical light curves are characterised by
an enhanced fading starting ~60 d after maximum and very low luminosities in
the nebular phase, which is most readily explained by unusually early formation
of clumpy dust in the ejecta. Taken together, these effects suggest a strongly
perturbed ejecta density profile, which might lend support to the idea that
09dc-like characteristics arise from a brief episode of interaction with a
hydrogen-deficient envelope during the first hours or days after the explosion.

many orbits on subspaces, we determine all faithful irreducible modules for
simple and maximal-semisimple connected algebraic groups that are orthogonal
and have finitely many orbits on singular $1$-spaces. This question is
naturally connected with the problem of finding for which pairs of subgroups
$H,K$ of an algebraic group $G$ there are finitely many $(H,K)$-double cosets.
This paper provides a solution to the question when $K$ is a maximal parabolic
subgroup $P_1$ of a classical group $SO_n$. We find an interesting range of new
examples ranging from a $5$-dimensional module for $SL_2$ to the spin module
for $B_6$ in characteristic $2$.

As expected from the symmetry of the system, we measure very short time-delays
for the three fainter images with respect to the brightest one: -0.23 $\pm$
0.99, -1.43 $\pm$ 0.74 and 1.36 $\pm$ 1.07 days. Interestingly, we find large
differences between the magnifications of the four supernova images, even after
accounting for uncertainties in the extinction corrections: $\Delta m_1 =

explanation for the large differences is gravitational lensing by
substructures, micro- or millilensing, in addition to the large scale lens
causing the image separations. We find that the inferred magnification is
insensitive to the assumptions about the dust properties in the host and lens

anomalies are functions that have considerably different geometric forms or
features from the rest of the data. Identifying them is generally more
difficult than identifying magnitude anomalies because shape anomalies are
often not distinguishable from the bulk of the data with visualization methods.
The proposed elastic depths use the recently developed elastic distances to
directly measure the centrality of functions in the amplitude and phase spaces.
Measuring shape outlyingness in these spaces provides a rigorous quantification
of shape, which gives the elastic depths a strong theoretical and practical
advantage over other methods in detecting shape anomalies. A simple boxplot and
thresholding method is introduced to identify shape anomalies using the elastic
depths. We assess the elastic depth's detection skill on simulated shape
outlier scenarios and compare them against popular shape anomaly detectors.
Finally, we use hurricane trajectories to demonstrate the elastic depth
methodology on manifold valued functional data. Supplementary materials,
including additional simulations, data examples, and an R-package are available

materials is investigated using the framework of large deformation
elastodynamics, for a family of loadings and commonly used hyperelastic
material models. Closed form expressions for the shock formation distance are
derived and used to construct non-dimensional phase maps that determine regimes
in which a shock can be realized. These maps reveal the sensitivity of shock
evolution to the amplitude, shape, and ramp time of the loading, and to the
elastic material parameters. In light of a recent study (Espindola et al.,
2017), which hypothesizes that shear shock formation could play a signicant
role in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), application to brain tissue is considered
and it is shown that the size matters in TBI research. Namely, for realistic
loadings, smaller brains are less susceptible to formation of shear shocks.
Furthermore, given the observed sensitivity to the imparted waveform and the
constitutive properties, it is suggested that the non-dimensional maps can
guide the design of protective structures by determining the combination of
loading parameters, material dimensions, and elastic properties that can avoid
shock formation.

the corners, while the next following 12 states are localized mostly on the

the ring diameter and width, the corner and side states may be separated by a
considerable energy gap, ranging from few to tens of meV. In a realistic

particles are not symmetrically distributed between all corner and side areas.
Possibly, even small deformations may shift the localization of the ground

Einstein's gravity is dynamically trivial in two dimensions. Moreover, the
diffeomorphism field can be interpreted as the gravitational analog of a
Yang-Mills field. This raises the question of whether the diffeomorphism field
exists in higher dimensions, and plays an essential role in gravity. With this
motivation, several dynamical theories for the diffeomorphism field have been
constructed by mimicking construction of Yang-Mills theory from Kac-Moody

  This thesis constitutes a further development for obtaining a consistent

others possible routes to follow have been laid down. Finally, alternative

challenging task for autonomous driving because this information is essential
for tracking and predicting pedestrian behavior. This paper presents a flexible
Virtual Multi-View Synthesis module that can be adopted into 3D object
detection methods to improve orientation estimation. The module uses a
multi-step process to acquire the fine-grained semantic information required
for accurate orientation estimation. First, the scene's point cloud is
densified using a structure preserving depth completion algorithm and each
point is colorized using its corresponding RGB pixel. Next, virtual cameras are
placed around each object in the densified point cloud to generate novel
viewpoints, which preserve the object's appearance. We show that this module
greatly improves the orientation estimation on the challenging pedestrian class
on the KITTI benchmark. When used with the open-source 3D detector AVOD-FPN, we
outperform all other published methods on the pedestrian Orientation, 3D, and
Bird's Eye View benchmarks.

exposure of mobile travelers' location information to untrusted LBS providers
may lead to privacy breaches. In this paper, we propose StarCloak, a
utility-aware and attack-resilient approach to building a privacy-preserving
query system for mobile users traveling on road networks. StarCloak has several
desirable properties. First, StarCloak supports user-defined k-user anonymity
and l-segment indistinguishability, along with user-specified spatial and
temporal utility constraints, for utility-aware and personalized location
privacy. Second, unlike conventional solutions which are indifferent to
underlying road network structure, StarCloak uses the concept of stars and
proposes cloaking graphs for effective location cloaking on road networks.
Third, StarCloak achieves strong attack-resilience against replay and query
injection-based attacks through randomized star selection and pruning. Finally,
to enable scalable query processing with high throughput, StarCloak makes
cost-aware star selection decisions by considering query evaluation and network
communication costs. We evaluate StarCloak on two real-world road network
datasets under various privacy and utility constraints. Results show that
StarCloak achieves improved query success rate and throughput, reduced
anonymization time and network usage, and higher attack-resilience in
comparison to XStar, its most relevant competitor.

cover diverse real-world scenes from various viewpoints, poses, occlusions,
illuminations, and backgrounds. (2) We conduct a large-scale (and, so far, the

systematically summarize 32 popular models and evaluate 18 parts of 32 models

simple general architecture, called Deep Depth-Depurator Network (D3Net). It
consists of a depth depurator unit (DDU) and a three-stream feature learning
module (FLM), which performs low-quality depth map filtering and cross-modal
feature learning respectively. These components form a nested structure and are
elaborately designed to be learned jointly. D3Net exceeds the performance of
any prior contenders across all five metrics under consideration, thus serving
as a strong model to advance research in this field. We also demonstrate that
D3Net can be used to efficiently extract salient object masks from real scenes,
enabling effective background changing application with a speed of 65fps on a
single GPU. All the saliency maps, our new SIP dataset, the D3Net model, and

That
is, a pose facing north and the same pose facing south are considered the same;
a character that can walk to the north is expected to be able to walk to the
south in a similar style. To achieve such direction invariance, the current
practice is to remove the facing direction's rotation around the vertical axis
before further processing. Such a scheme, however, is not robust for rotational
behaviors in the sagittal plane. In search of a smooth scheme to achieve
direction invariance, we prove that in general a singularity free scheme does
not exist. We further connect the problem with the hairy ball theorem, which is
better-known to the graphics community. Due to the nonexistence of a
singularity free scheme, a general solution does not exist and we propose a
remedy by using a properly-chosen motion direction that can avoid singularities
for specific motions at hand. We perform comparative studies using two
deep-learning based methods, one builds kinematic motion representations and
the other learns physics-based controls. The results show that with our robust

important to characterize the scenarios that are most likely to result in
failure. Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) provides a way to search for the
most-likely failure scenario as a Markov decision process (MDP). Our previous
work used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solver to identify likely failure
scenarios. However, the solver's use of a feed-forward neural network with a
discretized space of possible initial conditions poses two major problems.
First, the system is not treated as a black box, in that it requires analyzing
the internal state of the system, which leads to considerable implementation
complexities. Second, in order to simulate realistic settings, a new instance
of the solver needs to be run for each initial condition. Running a new solver
for each initial condition not only significantly increases the computational
complexity, but also disregards the underlying relationship between similar
initial conditions. We provide a solution to both problems by employing a
recurrent neural network that takes a set of initial conditions from a
continuous space as input. This approach enables robust and efficient detection
of failures because the solution generalizes across the entire space of initial
conditions. By simulating an instance where an autonomous car drives while a
pedestrian is crossing a road, we demonstrate the solver is now capable of
finding solutions for problems that would have previously been intractable.

to advancing research is the ability to partner with commercial foundries to
produce custom devices that meet the needs of specific instruments. For more
than 20 years, Teledyne DALSA Semiconductor was the primary industrial partner
in the manufacturing of 150 mm wafers for CCDs. DALSA is migrating the
manufacturing from 150mm to 200mm wafer diameter and will not be updating their
CCD processing tools for the new format wafer. As a result, DALSA will no
longer serve as a partner to the astronomy community in the manufacturing of
CCDs. We recommend that the Department of Energy, National Science Foundation,
and NASA jointly pursue a new commercial partner in CCD fabrication to maintain
capabilities in custom CCD design for astronomy applications.

one-dimensional spin-less extended Falicov-Kimball model. Several numerical
methods are employed and benchmarked against each other: time-dependent
mean-field simulations, the second-Born approximation (2BA) within the
Kadanoff-Baym formalism, the generalized Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz (GKBA)
implemented with the 2BA and the infinite time-evolving block decimation
(iTEBD) method. It is found that the GKBA gives the best agreement with iTEBD
and captures the relevant physics. We find that excitations to the
particle-hole continuum and resonant excitations of the equilibrium exciton
result in a qualitatively different dynamics. In the former case, the exciton
binding energy remains positive and the frequency of the corresponding coherent
oscillations is smaller than the band gap. On the other hand, resonant
excitations trigger a collective mode whose frequency is larger than the band
gap. We discuss the origin of these different behaviors by evaluating the
nonequilibrium susceptibility using the nonthermal distribution and a random
phase approximation. The peculiar mode with frequency larger than the band gap
is associated with a partial population inversion with a sharp energy cutoff.
We also discuss the effects of the cooling by a phonon bath. We demonstrate the
real-time development of coherence in the polarization, which indicates
excitonic condensation out of equilibrium.

them to small training data are primary tasks in deep learning research. In
this paper, we replace the output activation function of DNNs, typically the
data-agnostic softmax function, with a graph Laplacian-based high dimensional
interpolating function which, in the continuum limit, converges to the solution
of a Laplace-Beltrami equation on a high dimensional manifold. Furthermore, we
propose end-to-end training and testing algorithms for this new architecture.
The proposed DNN with graph interpolating activation integrates the advantages
of both deep learning and manifold learning. Compared to the conventional DNNs
with the softmax function as output activation, the new framework demonstrates
the following major advantages: First, it is better applicable to
data-efficient learning in which we train high capacity DNNs without using a
large number of training data. Second, it remarkably improves both natural
accuracy on the clean images and robust accuracy on the adversarial images
crafted by both white-box and black-box adversarial attacks. Third, it is a
natural choice for semi-supervised learning. For reproducibility, the code is

this work we formulate and study the coded caching problem when the file
requests from the users arrive at different times. We assume that each user
also has a prescribed deadline by which they want their request to be
completed. In the offline case, we assume that the server knows the arrival

are revealed to the server over time. We present a linear programming
formulation for the offline case that minimizes the overall rate subject to
constraint that each user meets his/her deadline. While the online case is much
harder, we introduce a novel heuristic for the online case and show that under
certain conditions, with high probability the request of each user can be
satisfied with her/his deadline. Our simulation results indicate that in the

demonstrate that the higher order gradients can significantly modify the

The spectrum of the standard Bloch oscillation is composed of a single prime
frequency and its higher harmonics, while the higher-order gradients in the
external potential give rise to fine structures in the spectrum around each of

investigation leads to a twofold consequence to the applications of Bloch

resolution of the measured spectrum, the fine structures would manifest as a
blur to the spectrum, and leads to intrinsic errors to the measurement. For
another, given that the fine structures could be experimentally resolved, they
can supply more information of the external force than the strength of the
linear gradient, and be used to measure more complicated forces.

framework that brings together the objectives, design, and deployment

key underlying ethical value in ICT projects, to ensure that the project does
not reinforce inequalities in power relationships between the actors directly
or indirectly associated with the project. We present a method to model ICT
projects to make legible its influence on the power relationships between
various actors in the ecosystem. Third, we discuss that the ethical values
underlying any ICT project ultimately need to be upheld by the project teams,
where certain factors like political ideologies or dispersed teams may affect
the rigour with which these ethical values are followed. These three aspects of
having an ethical underpinning to the design and management of ICT projects,
the need for having a power-based equality principle for ICT projects, and the
importance of socialization of the project teams, needs increasing attention in

reduced the efficiency by 50%, which fundamentally limited the scaling of

these two states are given by exponential or power-law distributions. We
develop a theory of alternating renewal processes to study a relaxation
function which is expressed with an integral of the diffusivity over time. This
relaxation function can be related to a position correlation function if the
particle is in a harmonic potential, and to the self-intermediate scattering
function if the potential force is absent. It is theoretically shown that, at
short times, the exponential relaxation or the stretched-exponential relaxation
are observed depending on the power law index of the sojourn-time
distributions. In contrast, at long times, a power law decay with an
exponential cutoff is observed. The dependencies on the initial ensembles
(i.e., equilibrium or non-equilibrium initial ensembles) are also elucidated.
These theoretical results are consistent with numerical simulations.

gas. Using zoom-in simulations, we demonstrate that switching the ISM models
can control formation of giant clumps in massive discs at redshifts
$z\sim1$--$2$ while their initial conditions and the other settings such as
stellar feedback are unchanged. Thus, not only feedback but ISM models can also
be responsible for clumpy morphologies of simulated galaxies. We find, however,
that changing the ISM models hardly affects global properties of galaxies, such
as the total stellar and gas masses, star formation rate, metallicity and
stellar angular momentum, irrespective of the significant difference of
clumpiness; namely the ISM models only change clumpiness of discs. In addition,
our approach provides a test to investigate impact by clump formation on the
evolution of disc galaxies using the same initial conditions and feedback. We
find that clump formation does not significantly alter the properties of
galaxies and therefore could not be the causes of starburst or quenching.

all the existing surfaces in the 3D reconstructed terrain as superpixel

However, the static test requires many samples to detect the velocity jump. On
the contrary, crack propagation performed under a dynamic boundary condition is
timesaving and cost-effective in that it requires only a single sample to

occurs only in the dynamic test for certain materials, for which the velocity
jump is hidden in the static test because of the effect of stress relaxation.

new compression method, \textit{Inter-Layer Weight Prediction} (ILWP) and
quantization method which quantize the predicted residuals between the weights
in all convolution layers based on an inter-frame prediction method in
conventional video coding schemes. Furthermore, we found a phenomenon
\textit{Smoothly Varying Weight Hypothesis} (SVWH) which is that the weights in
adjacent convolution layers share strong similarity in shapes and values, i.e.,
the weights tend to vary smoothly along with the layers. Based on SVWH, we
propose a second ILWP and quantization method which quantize the predicted
residuals between the weights in adjacent convolution layers. Since the
predicted weight residuals tend to follow Laplace distributions with very low
variance, the weight quantization can more effectively be applied, thus
producing more zero weights and enhancing the weight compression ratio. In
addition, we propose a new \textit{inter-layer loss} for eliminating
non-texture bits, which enabled us to more effectively store only texture bits.
That is, the proposed loss regularizes the weights such that the collocated
weights between the adjacent two layers have the same values. Finally, we
propose an ILWP with an inter-layer loss and quantization method. Our
comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a much higher

the learning activities. It is an important research area for providing a
personalized learning platform to students. In recent years, methods based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) such as Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and
Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) outperformed all the traditional
methods because of their ability to capture complex representation of human

dealing with sparse data which is the case with real-world data as students
interact with few KCs. In order to address this issue, we develop an approach

dedicated to monitoring the transient gamma-ray sky in the energy range from 10

local universe. The scientific goal of GRID is, in synergy with ground-based
gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO, to accumulate a
sample of GRBs associated with the merger of two compact stars and study jets
and related physics of those objects. It also involves observing and studying
other gamma-ray transients such as long GRBs, soft gamma-ray repeaters,
terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, and solar flares. With multiple CubeSats in
various orbits, GRID is unaffected by the Earth occultation and serves as a
full-time and all-sky monitor. Assuming a horizon of 200 Mpc for ground-based
GW detectors, we expect to see a few associated GW-GRB events per year. With
about 10 CubeSats in operation, GRID is capable of localizing a faint GRB like
170817A with a 90% error radius of about 10 degrees, through triangulation and
flux modulation. GRID is proposed and developed by students, with considerable
contribution from undergraduate students, and will remain operated as a student

profound importance to VAE, both qualitative and quantitative. We introduce and
fully characterize a new [0,1]-supported, single parameter distribution: the

distribution is not nitpicking; it produces meaningful performance improvements
across a range of metrics and datasets, including sharper image samples, and

Singapore and Hong Kong. In each case, we estimate from data the model
parameters that measure each language utility for its speakers and the strength
of two biases, the majority preference for their language, and the minority
aversion to it. The values of these two biases decide which language is the
fastest growing in the competition and what would be the stable state of the
system. We also study the system convergence time to stable states and discover
the existence of tipping points with multiple attractors. Moreover, the
critical slowdown of convergence to the stable fractions of language users
appears near and peaks at the tipping points, signaling when the system
approaches them. Our analysis furthers our understanding of multiple language
evolution and the role of tipping points in behavioral transitions. These
insights may help to protect languages from extinction and retain the language

deep neural networks have been utilized for social recommendations, which
facilitate both the user-item interactions and the social network information.
However, most of these models cannot take full advantage of the social network

treat neighbors' information equally without considering the specific

and of $\ell_\infty$-embeddings differ, and how significant can this difference
be. Recall that a distance labeling is a distributed representation of
distances in a metric space $(X,d)$, where each point $x\in X$ is assigned a
succinct label, such that the distance between any two points $x,y \in X$ can
be approximated given only their labels. A highly structured special case is an
embedding into $\ell_\infty$, where each point $x\in X$ is assigned a vector
$f(x)$ such that $\|f(x)-f(y)\|_\infty$ is approximately $d(x,y)$. The
performance of a distance labeling or an $\ell_\infty$-embedding is measured
via its distortion and its label-size/dimension.
  We also study the analogous question for the prioritized versions of these
two measures. Here, a priority order $\pi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ of the point set $X$
is given, and higher-priority points should have shorter labels. Formally, a
distance labeling has prioritized label-size $\alpha(.)$ if every $x_j$ has
label size at most $\alpha(j)$. Similarly, an embedding $f: X \to \ell_\infty$
has prioritized dimension $\alpha(.)$ if $f(x_j)$ is non-zero only in the first
$\alpha(j)$ coordinates. In addition, we compare these their prioritized
measures to their classical (worst-case) versions.
  We answer these questions in several scenarios, uncovering a surprisingly
diverse range of behaviors. First, in some cases labelings and embeddings have
very similar worst-case performance, but in other cases there is a huge
disparity. However in the prioritized setting, we most often find a strict
separation between the performance of labelings and embeddings. And finally,
when comparing the classical and prioritized settings, we find that the
worst-case bound for label size often ``translates'' to a prioritized one, but
also a surprising exception to this rule.

characterise the system created in high energy proton-proton (pp),
proton-nucleus (pA) and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions. In particular, nuclei
and hyper-nuclei are special objects with respect to non-composite hadrons
(such as pions, kaons, protons, etc.), because their size is comparable to a
fraction or the whole system created in the collision. Their formation is
typically described within the framework of coalescence and thermal-statistical
production models. In order to distinguish between the two production
scenarios, we propose to measure the coalescence parameter B$_{A}$ for
different anti- and hyper-nuclei (that differ by mass, size and internal
wave-function) as a function of the size of the particle emitting source. The
latter can be controlled by performing systematic measurements of light
(anti-)(hyper-)nuclei in different collision systems (pp, pA, AA) and as a
function of the multiplicity of particles created in the collision. While it is
often argued that the coalescence and the thermal model approach give very
similar predictions for the production of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions,
our study shows that large differences can be expected for hyper-nuclei with
extended wave-functions, as the hyper-triton. We compare the model predictions

into many real application tasks that can accept slightly-reduced model

Distillation, which distills the knowledge from well-trained and highly complex
teacher model into a compact student model, has been widely used for model
compression. However, under the strict requirement on the resource cost, it is
quite challenging to achieve comparable performance with the teacher model,
essentially due to the drastically-reduced expressiveness ability of the
compact student model. Inspired by the nature of the expressiveness ability in
Neural Networks, we propose to use multi-segment activation, which can
significantly improve the expressiveness ability with very little cost, in the
compact student model. Specifically, we propose a highly efficient
multi-segment activation, called Light Multi-segment Activation (LMA), which
can rapidly produce multiple linear regions with very few parameters by
leveraging the statistical information. With using LMA, the compact student
model is capable of achieving much better performance effectively and
efficiently, than the ReLU-equipped one with same model scale. Furthermore, the
proposed method is compatible with other model compression techniques, such as
quantization, which means they can be used jointly for better compression
performance. Experiments on state-of-the-art NN architectures over the
real-world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and extensibility of the LMA.

self-driving cars. The advantage of video segmentation approaches compared to
single image segmentation is that temporal image information is considered, and
their performance increases due to this. Hence, single image segmentation
approaches are extended by recurrent units such as convolutional LSTM
(convLSTM) cells, which are placed at suitable positions in the basic network
architecture. However, a major critique of video segmentation approaches based
on recurrent neural networks is their large parameter count and their
computational complexity, and so, their inference time of one video frame takes
up to 66 percent longer than their basic version. Inspired by the success of
the spatial and depthwise separable convolutional neural networks, we
generalize these techniques for convLSTMs in this work, so that the number of
parameters and the required FLOPs are reduced significantly. Experiments on
different datasets show that the segmentation approaches using the proposed,
modified convLSTM cells achieve similar or slightly worse accuracy, but are up
to 15 percent faster on a GPU than the ones using the standard convLSTM cells.
Furthermore, a new evaluation metric is introduced, which measures the amount
of flickering pixels in the segmented video sequence.

explores labels in the synthetic domain and temporal constraints in the videos

ground-truth optical flow and pose information in the synthetic data to learn
moving mask and pose prediction networks. The learned moving masks can filter
out moving regions that produces erroneous temporal constraints and the
estimated poses provide better initializations for estimating temporal

it can be applied to already trained architectures. We thoroughly validate the

transmitted light. The most typical example is the natural optical activity,
which has the symmetry property of changing sign after space inversion but
being invariant to time inversion. Faraday rotation exhibits the opposite: it
is invariant to space inversion but changes sign after time reversal. Here, we
demonstrate that in a magnetoelectric material, another type of polarization
rotation is possible. This effect is investigated in magnetoelectric
YbAl3(BO3)4 under the viewpoint of time and space inversion symmetry arguments.
We observe the sign change of the rotation sense under either time or space
reversal. This investigation proves that the polarization rotation in
YbAl3(BO3)4 must be classified as gyrotropic birefringence, which has been
discussed within the idea of time-reversal breaking in underdoped cuprates. The
diagonal terms in the magnetoelectric susceptibility are responsible for the
observed signal of gyrotropic birefringence. Further analysis of the
experimental spectra reveals a substantial contribution of the natural optical
activity to the polarization rotation. We also demonstrate that the observed
activity originates from the magnetoelectric susceptibility.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to optimize a diverse set of synthetic
non-convex differentiable functions via gradient descent have been effective at
optimizing derivative-free black-box functions. In this work, we propose
RNN-Opt: an approach for learning RNN-based optimizers for optimizing
real-parameter single-objective continuous functions under limited budget
constraints. Existing approaches utilize an observed improvement based
meta-learning loss function for training such models. We propose training
RNN-Opt by using synthetic non-convex functions with known (approximate)
optimal values by directly using discounted regret as our meta-learning loss
function. We hypothesize that a regret-based loss function mimics typical
testing scenarios, and would therefore lead to better optimizers compared to
optimizers trained only to propose queries that improve over previous queries.
Further, RNN-Opt incorporates simple yet effective enhancements during training
and inference procedures to deal with the following practical challenges: i)
Unknown range of possible values for the black-box function to be optimized,
and ii) Practical and domain-knowledge based constraints on the input
parameters. We demonstrate the efficacy of RNN-Opt in comparison to existing
methods on several synthetic as well as standard benchmark black-box functions
along with an anonymized industrial constrained optimization problem.

how music should be designed to aid performance. Since acoustic modulation has
been shown to shape neural activity in known networks, we chose to test the
effects of acoustic modulation on sustained attention, which requires activity
in these networks and is a common ingredient for success across many tasks. To
understand how specific aspects of background music influence sustained
attention, we manipulated the rate and depth of amplitude modulations imposed
on otherwise identical music. This produced stimuli that were musically and
acoustically identical except for a peak in the modulation spectrum that could
change intensity or shift location under manipulations of depth or rate
respectively. These controlled musical backgrounds were presented to
participants (total N = 677) during the sustained attention to response (SART)
task. In two experiments, we show performance benefits due to added modulation,
with best performance at 16 Hz (beta band) rate and higher modulation depths;
neighboring parameter settings did not produce this benefit. Further
examination of individual differences within our overall sample showed that
those with a high level of self-reported ADHD symptomaticity tended to perform
better with more intense beta modulation. These results suggest optimal
parameters for adding modulation to background music, which are consistent with
theories of oscillatory dynamics that relate auditory stimulation to behavior,
yet demonstrate the need for a personalized approach in creating functional

disk galaxies due to the action of bars is known as bar quenching. We
investigate here the significance of bar quenching in the global quenching of
star formation in the barred galaxies and their transformation to passive
galaxies in the local Universe. We do this by measuring the offset of quenched
barred galaxies from star-forming main sequence galaxies in the star formation
rate-stellar mass plane and comparing it with the length of the bar, which is
considered as a proxy of bar quenching. We constructed the star formation
rate-stellar mass plane of 2885 local Universe face-on strong barred disk
galaxies ($z<0.06$) identified by Galaxy Zoo. The barred disk galaxies studied
here fall on the star formation main sequence relation with a significant
scatter for galaxies above stellar mass 10$^{10.2}$ M$\odot$. We found that
34.97 $\%$ galaxies are within the intrinsic scatter (0.3 dex) of the main
sequence relation, with a starburst population of 10.78 $\%$ (above the 0.3
dex) and a quenched population of 54.25 $\%$ (below the -0.3 dex) of the total
barred disk galaxies in our sample. Significant neutral hydrogen (M$_{HI}$
>10$^{9}$ M$\odot$ with log M$_{HI}$/M$\star$ $\sim$ -1.0 to -0.5) is detected
in the quenched barred galaxies with a similar gas content to that of the
star-forming barred galaxies. We found that the offset of the quenched barred
galaxies from the main sequence relation is not dependent on the length of the
stellar bar. This implies that the bar quenching may not contribute
significantly to the global quenching of star formation in barred galaxies.
However, this observed result could also be due to other factors such as the
dissolution of bars over time after star formation quenching, the effect of
other quenching processes acting simultaneously, and/or the effects of
environment.

of the wave function. We generate an arbitrary number of topological segments
in a Kitaev chain. A pair of topological edge states emerge at the edges of a
topological segment. Its wave function is observable by the position and the
phase of a peak in impedance measurement. It is possible to braid any pair of
neighboring edge states with the aid of T-junction geometry. By calculating the
Berry phase acquired by their eigenfunctions, the braiding is shown to generate
one-qubit and two-qubit unitary operations. We explicitly construct Clifford
quantum gates based on them. We also present an operator formalism by regarding

during training, and innovations such as residual connections introduced more
recently than BN layers could potentially have lessened their impact. In this
paper we aim to quantify the benefits BN layers offer in image classification
networks, in comparison with alternative choices. In particular, we study
networks that use shifted-ReLU layers instead of BN layers. We found, following
experiments with wide residual networks applied to the ImageNet, CIFAR 10 and

offer a significant advantage. We found that the accuracy margin offered by BN
layers depends on the data set, the network size, and the bit-depth of weights.
We conclude that in situations where BN layers are undesirable due to speed,
memory or complexity costs, that using shifted-ReLU layers instead should be
considered; we found they can offer advantages in all these areas, and often do

detectors' frequency band are rotating non-axisymmetric neutron stars emitting
long-lasting, almost-monochromatic gravitational waves. Searches for these
continuous gravitational-wave signals are usually performed in long stretches
of data in a matched-filter framework e.g., the F-statistic method. In an
all-sky search for a priori unknown sources, large number of templates is
matched against the data using a pre-defined grid of variables (the
gravitational-wave frequency and its derivatives, sky coordinates),
subsequently producing a collection of candidate signals, corresponding to the
grid points at which the signal reaches a pre-defined signal-to-noise
threshold. An astrophysical signature of the signal is encoded in the
multi-dimensional vector distribution of the candidate signals. In the first
work of this kind, we apply a deep learning approach to classify the
distributions. We consider three basic classes: Gaussian noise, astrophysical
gravitational-wave signal, and a constant-frequency detector artifact
(""stationary line""), the two latter injected into the Gaussian noise. 1D and 2D
versions of a convolutional neural network classifier are implemented, trained
and tested on a broad range of signal frequencies. We demonstrate that these
implementations correctly classify the instances of data at various
signal-to-noise ratios and signal frequencies, while also showing concept
generalization i.e., satisfactory performance at previously unseen frequencies.
In addition we discuss the deficiencies, computational requirements and
possible applications of these implementations.

The above phonons are formed by the presence of flat band, resulting from the

that so - called Planckian limit, widely used to explain the above universal
scattering rate, may occur accidentally as in conventional metals its
experimental manifestations (e.g. scattering rate at room and higher

adoption of deep convolutional neural networks. Its many applications have
attracted tremendous interest in recent years. However, many practical
applications require pose estimation for human crowds, which still is a rarely
addressed problem. In this work, we explore methods to optimize pose estimation
for human crowds, focusing on challenges introduced with dense crowds, such as
occlusions, people in close proximity to each other, and partial visibility of
people. In order to address these challenges, we evaluate three aspects of a
pose detection approach: i) a data augmentation method to introduce robustness
to occlusions, ii) the explicit detection of occluded body parts, and iii) the
use of the synthetic generated datasets. The first approach to improve the
accuracy in crowded scenarios is to generate occlusions at training time using
person and object cutouts from the object recognition dataset COCO (Common
Objects in Context). Furthermore, the synthetically generated dataset JTA
(Joint Track Auto) is evaluated for the use in real-world crowd applications.
In order to overcome the transfer gap of JTA originating from a low pose
variety and less dense crowds, an extension dataset is created to ease the use
for real-world applications. Additionally, the occlusion flags provided with
JTA are utilized to train a model, which explicitly distinguishes between
occluded and visible body parts in two distinct branches. The combination of
the proposed additions to the baseline method help to improve the overall
accuracy by 4.7% AP and thereby provide comparable results to current
state-of-the-art approaches on the respective dataset.

function and the Bregman-Tweedie divergence. The base function of this
divergence is the convex function of Legendre type induced from the extended

function between unhinge loss and the logistic loss function. Actually, we have
two sub-models of the Bregman-Tweedie classification model; H-Bregman with
hinge-like loss function and L-Bregman with logistic-like loss function.

approaches to solving the solar abundance problem investigated before. In the
second part of the paper we consider the poorly studied before non-diffusive
energy transport solutions to the problem. We calculate the additional energy
flux inside the Sun evidenced by the combined data from helioseismology,
spectroscopy and solar neutrino detection experiments. Our findings suggest
that the solar abundance problem can be solved by a localized loss of energy
near the radiative zone boundary and a gain of approximately the same amount of
energy inside the solar core ($0.1R_{\odot} \lesssim r \lesssim 0.3R_{\odot}$).
We show that if the localized loss of energy is associated with the resonant
emission of transversely polarized hidden photons, the kinetic mixing parameter
required does not contradict any of the existing constraints, the ones from the
Sun being relaxed as long as the energy loss is compensated by energy
deposition inside the core. We introduce then the light dark fermions coupled
to hidden photons and discuss their interactions with the solar plasma. We find
the distribution of these dark particles inside the inner part of the radiative
zone which is required to provide the necessary heating of the core.

Specifically, we exploit the similarity between refugees' and locals' spatial

assess integration dynamics. Together with the already known methods for data
analysis, we use a novel computational approach to analyze spatiotemporal
patterns: Computational Stigmergy, a bio-inspired scalar and temporal
aggregation of samples. Computational Stigmergy associates each sample to a
virtual pheromone deposit (mark). Marks in spatiotemporal proximity are
aggregated into functional structures called trails, which summarize the
spatiotemporal patterns in data and allows computing the similarity between
different patterns. According to our results, collective mobility and
behavioral similarity with locals have great potential as measures of
integration, since they are: (i) correlated with the amount of interaction with
locals; (ii) an effective proxy for refugee's economic capacity, thus refugee's
potential employment; and (iii) able to capture events that may disrupt the

time will inevitably display non-stationary behavior. Such processes are both
challenging to model and computationally expensive when the data size is large.
Instead of modeling the global non-stationarity explicitly, local models can be
applied to disjoint regions of the domain. The choice of the size of these
regions is dictated by a bias-variance trade-off; large regions will have
smaller variance and larger bias, whereas small regions will have higher
variance and smaller bias. From both the modeling and computational point of
view, small regions are preferable to better accommodate the non-stationarity.
However, in practice, large regions are necessary to control the variance. We
propose a novel Bayesian three-step approach that allows for smaller regions
without compromising the increase of the variance that would follow. We are
able to propagate the uncertainty from one step to the next without issues
caused by reusing the data. The improvement in inference also results in
improved prediction, as our simulated example shows. We illustrate this new

measurements is considered. The acoustical characterisation of poroelastic
materials based on various measurements is typically carried out by minimising
a cost functional of model residuals, such as the least squares functional.
With a limited number of unknown parameters, least squares type approaches can
provide both reliable parameter and error estimates. With an increasing number
of parameters, both the least squares parameter estimates and, in particular,
the error estimates often become unreliable. In this paper, the estimation of
the material parameters of an inhomogeneous poroelastic (Biot) plate in the
Bayesian framework for inverse problems is considered. Reflection and
transmission measurements are performed and 11 poroelastic parameters, as well
as 4 measurement setup-related nuisance parameters, are estimated. A Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm is employed for the computational inference to
assess the actual uncertainty of the estimated parameters. The results suggest
that the proposed approach for poroelastic material characterisation can reveal
the heterogeneities in the object, and yield reliable parameter and uncertainty
estimates.

discrete Heisenberg groups, with two $\mathbf{Z}_N$ generators $A$, $B$ with

from a universal structure in the infinite dimer in $\mathbf{R}^2$ giving the
covering space of the unit cell of the parent theory before orbifolding. The
generator $A$ is realized as a shift in the dimer diagram, associated to the
orbifold quantum symmetry; the action of $B$ is determined by equations
describing a 1-form in the dimer graph in the unit cell of the parent theory
with twisted boundary conditions; finally, $C$ is an element of the (mesonic
and baryonic) non-anomalous U$(1)$ symmetries, determined by geometric
identities involving the elements of the dimer graph of the parent theory.
These discrete global symmetries of the quiver gauge theories are
holographically dual to discrete gauge symmetries from torsion cycles in the
horizon, as we also briefly discuss. Our findings allow to easily construct the
discrete symmetries for infinite classes of orbifolds. We provide explicit
examples by constructing the discrete symmetries for the infinite classes of

plays an important role in the formation of core-collapse supernova explosions.
Upon encountering the supernova shock, additional turbulence is generated,
amplifying the explosion. In this work, we study how the convective
perturbations evolve during the stellar collapse. Our main aim is to establish
their physical properties right before they reach the supernova shock. To this
end, we solve the linearized hydrodynamics equations perturbed on a stationary
background flow. The latter is approximated by the spherical transonic Bondi
accretion, while the convective perturbations are modeled as a combination of
entropy and vorticity waves. We follow their evolution from large radii, where
convective shells are initially located, down to small radii, where they are
expected to encounter the accretion shock above the proto-neutron star.
Considering typical vorticity perturbations with a Mach number $\sim 0.1$ and
entropy perturbations with magnitude $\sim 0.05 k_\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{baryon}$,
we find that the advection of these perturbations down to the shock generates
acoustic waves with a relative amplitude $\delta p/\gamma p \lesssim 10\%$, in
agreement with published numerical simulations. The velocity perturbations
consist of contributions from acoustic and vorticity waves with values reaching
$\sim 10\%$ of the sound speed ahead of the shock. The perturbation amplitudes
decrease with increasing $\ell$ and initial radii of the convective shells.

The interferometer performance is analyzed for initial states without seeding,

pseudospin-1 Dirac particles in a random one-dimensional scalar potential. We
focus explicitly on the effect of disorder correlations, considering a
short-range correlated dichotomous random potential at all strengths of
disorder. We also consider a $\delta$-function correlated random potential at
weak disorder. Using the invariant imbedding method, we calculate the
localization length in a numerically precise way and analyze its dependencies
on incident angle, disorder correlation length, disorder strength, energy,
wavelength and average potential over a wide range of parameter values. In
addition, we derive analytical formulas for the localization length, which are
very accurate in the weak and strong disorder regimes. From the Dirac equation,
we obtain an expression for the effective wave impedance, using which we
explain several conditions for delocalization. We also deduce a condition under
which the localization length vanishes. For all cases considered, the
localization length depends non-monotonically on the disorder correlation
length and diverges as $\theta^{-4}$ as the incident angle $\theta$ goes to
zero. As the disorder strength is varied from zero to infinity, we find that
there appear three different scaling regimes. As the energy or wavelength is
varied from zero to infinity, there appear three or four different scaling
regimes with different exponents, depending on the value of the average
potential. The crossovers between different scaling regimes are explained in
terms of the disorder correlation effect.

$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ of $(X,d)$, an embedding $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to
have a prioritized distortion $\alpha(\cdot)$, if for any pair $x_j,x'$ of
distinct points in $X$, the distortion provided by $f$ for this pair is at most
$\alpha(j)$. If $Y$ is a normed space, the embedding is said to have
prioritized dimension $\beta(\cdot)$, if $f(x_j)$ may have nonzero entries only
in its first $\beta(j)$ coordinates.
  The notion of prioritized embedding was introduced by \cite{EFN15}, where a
general methodology for constructing such embeddings was developed. Though this
methodology enables \cite{EFN15} to come up with many prioritized embeddings,
it typically incurs some loss in the distortion. This loss is problematic for
isometric embeddings. It is also troublesome for Matousek's embedding of
general metrics into $\ell_\infty$, which for a parameter $k = 1,2,\ldots$,
provides distortion $2k-1$ and dimension $O(k \log n \cdot n^{1/k})$.
  In this paper we devise two lossless prioritized embeddings. The first one is
an isometric prioritized embedding of tree metrics into $\ell_\infty$ with
dimension $O(\log j)$. The second one is a prioritized Matousek's embedding of
general metrics into $\ell_\infty$, which provides prioritized distortion $2
\lceil k {{\log j} \over {\log n}} \rceil - 1$ and dimension $O(k \log n \cdot
n^{1/k})$, again matching the worst-case guarantee $2k-1$ in the distortion of
the classical Matousek's embedding. We also provide a dimension-prioritized
variant of Matousek's embedding. Finally, we devise prioritized embeddings of
general metrics into (single) ultra-metric and of general graphs into (single)
spanning tree with asymptotically optimal distortion.

reproducible study is one where the results can be recreated by different

majority of research is currently adherent. Methods: We objectively evaluated
300 trials in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology for fourteen indicators of
reproducibility. These indicators include availability of data, analysis
scripts, pre-registration information, study protocols and whether or not the
study was available via Open Access. We also assessed the trials for financial
conflict of interest statements and source of funding. Results: Of the 300

reproducibility. None of the trials in our sample provided a link to their

through adding perturbations to latent features along the normal of the

processes fulfil the role of resources, and a new set of objects called
superprocesses, corresponding to operationally implementable control of the

multi-time processes, we present a hierarchy of examples induced by restricting
quantum or classical communication within the superprocess - corresponding to a
client-server scenario. The resulting nine resource theories have different
notions of quantum or classical memory as the determinant of their utility.
Furthermore, one of these theories has a strict correspondence between
non-useful processes and those that are Markovian and, therefore, could be said
to be a true 'quantum resource theory of non-Markovianity'.

large-scale stroke rehabilitation neuroimaging analyses. Nevertheless, there
are great challenges with this task, such as large range of stroke lesion
scales and the tissue intensity similarity. The famous encoder-decoder
convolutional neural network, which although has made great achievements in
medical image segmentation areas, may fail to address these challenges due to
the insufficient uses of multi-scale features and context information. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a Cross-Level fusion and Context
Inference Network (CLCI-Net) for the chronic stroke lesion segmentation from
T1-weighted MR images. Specifically, a Cross-Level feature Fusion (CLF)
strategy was developed to make full use of different scale features across
different levels; Extending Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) with CLF, we
have enriched multi-scale features to handle the different lesion sizes; In
addition, convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) is employed to infer
context information and thus capture fine structures to address the intensity
similarity issue. The proposed approach was evaluated on an open-source
dataset, the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) with the
results showing that our network outperforms five state-of-the-art methods. We
make our code and models available at https://github.com/YH0517/CLCI_Net.

inefficient, leading practical systems to rely on synchronous protocols. This
paper attempts to simplify asynchronous consensus by building atop a novel
threshold logical clock abstraction, which enables upper layers to operate as
if on a synchronous network. This approach yields an asynchronous consensus
protocol for fail-stop nodes that may be simpler and more robust than Paxos and
its leader-based variants, requiring no common coins and achieving consensus in
a constant expected number of rounds. The same approach can be strengthened
against Byzantine failures by building on well-established techniques such as
tamper-evident logging and gossip, accountable state machines, threshold
signatures and witness cosigning, and verifiable secret sharing. This
combination of existing abstractions and threshold logical clocks yields a
modular, cleanly-layered approach to building practical and efficient Byzantine
consensus, distributed key generation, time, timestamping, and randomness

effective way to improve the performance of semantic segmentation models.
Existing methods are mainly based on insufficient hand-crafted rules that only
partially capture the image structure, and some methods can also suffer from
the efficiency issue. As a result, most of the state-of-the-art fully
convolutional networks did not adopt these techniques. In this work, we propose
a simple, fast yet effective method that exploits structural information
through direct supervision with minor additional expense. To be specific, our
method explicitly requires the network to predict semantic segmentation as well
as dilated affinity, which is a sparse version of pair-wise pixel affinity. The
capability of telling the relationships between pixels are directly built into
the model and enhance the quality of segmentation in two stages. 1) Joint
training with dilated affinity can provide robust feature representations and
thus lead to finer segmentation results. 2) The extra output of affinity
information can be further utilized to refine the original segmentation with a
fast propagation process. Consistent improvements are observed on various
benchmark datasets when applying our framework to the existing state-of-the-art
model. Codes will be released soon.

$k$ priorities can be computed as a $k$-nested fixpoint of a suitable function;
straightforward computation of this nested fixpoint requires
$\mathcal{O}(n^{\frac{k}{2}})$ iterations of the function. Calude et al.'s
recent quasipolynomial-time parity game solving algorithm essentially shows how
to compute the same fixpoint in only quasipolynomially many iterations by
reducing parity games to quasipolynomially sized safety games. Universal graphs
have been used to modularize this transformation of parity games to equivalent
safety games that are obtained by combining the original game with a universal
graph. We show that this approach naturally generalizes to the computation of
solutions of systems of \emph{any} fixpoint equations over finite lattices;
hence, the solution of fixpoint equation systems can be computed by
quasipolynomially many iterations of the equations. We present applications to
modal fixpoint logics and games beyond relational semantics. For instance, the
model checking problems for the energy $\mu$-calculus, finite latticed
$\mu$-calculi, and the graded and the (two-valued) probabilistic $\mu$-calculus
-- with numbers coded in binary -- can be solved via nested fixpoints of
functions that differ substantially from the function for parity games but
still can be computed in quasipolynomial time; our result hence implies that
model checking for these $\mu$-calculi is in QP. Moreover, we improve the
exponent in known exponential bounds on satisfiability checking.

two-step process in which (1) a large and diverse set of policies is learned in
simulation, and (2) a planning or learning algorithm chooses the most
appropriate policies according to the current situation (e.g., a damaged robot,
a new object, etc.). In this paper, we relax the assumption of previous works
that a single repertoire is enough for adaptation. Instead, we generate
repertoires for many different situations (e.g., with a missing leg, on
different floors, etc.) and let our algorithm selects the most useful prior.
Our main contribution is an algorithm, APROL (Adaptive Prior selection for
Repertoire-based Online Learning) to plan the next action by incorporating
these priors when the robot has no information about the current situation. We
evaluate APROL on two simulated tasks: (1) pushing unknown objects of various
shapes and sizes with a robotic arm and (2) a goal reaching task with a damaged
hexapod robot. We compare with ""Reset-free Trial and Error"" (RTE) and various
single repertoire-based baselines. The results show that APROL solves both the
tasks in less interaction time than the baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate
APROL on a real, damaged hexapod that quickly learns to pick compensatory
policies to reach a goal by avoiding obstacles in the path.

work is based on rumor spreading patterns revealed by recent rumor studies and
semantic relatedness between labeled and unlabeled data. A state-of-the-art
neural language model (NLM) and large credibility-focused Twitter corpora are
employed to learn context-sensitive representations of rumor tweets. Six
different real-world events based on three publicly available rumor datasets

Preliminary experiments with a state-of-the-art deep learning-based rumor
detection model show that augmented data can alleviate over-fitting and class
imbalance caused by limited train data and can help to train complex neural
networks (NNs). With augmented data, the performance of rumor detection can be
improved by 12.1% in terms of F-score. Our experiments also indicate that
augmented training data can help to generalize rumor detection models on unseen

models can be resolved into functions of scalar fields. Examples of such qois
include the lift over an airfoil or the displacement of a loaded structure;
examples of corresponding fields are the static pressure field in a
computational fluid dynamics solution, and the strain field in the finite
element elasticity analysis. These scalar fields are evaluated at each node
within a discretised computational domain. In certain scenarios, the field at a
certain node is only weakly influenced by far-field perturbations; it is likely
to be strongly governed by local perturbations, which in turn can be caused by
uncertainties in the geometry. One can interpret this as a strong anisotropy of
the field with respect to uncertainties in prescribed inputs. We exploit this
notion of localised scalar-field influence for approximating global qois, which
often are integrals of certain field quantities. We formalise our ideas by
assigning ridge approximations for the field at select nodes. This embedded
ridge approximation has favorable theoretical properties for approximating a
global qoi in terms of the reduced number of computational evaluations

ground-based instruments, the presence of residual turbulent wavefront errors
due to partial adaptive optics correction causes an additional difficulty to
the challenge of measuring aberrations in the presence of a coronagraph. In
this paper, we present an extension of COFFEE, the coronagraphic phase
diversity, to the estimation of quasi-static aberrations in the presence of
adaptive optics-corrected residual turbulence. We perform realistic numerical

analyze the applicability of mathematical techniques in the sciences, and
introduce a distinction between techniques that are applicable and those that
are merely instrumental. Unfortunately the authors have not shown that their
distinction is a clear and fruitful one, as the examples they provide are
superficial and unconvincing. Moreover, their analysis is vitiated by a
reliance on a naive version of object realism which has long been abandoned by
most philosophical realists in favor of truth-value realism. ET's argument
against the applicability of hyperreals based on automorphisms of hyperreal
models involves massaging the evidence and is similarly unconvincing. The
purpose of the ET text is to argue that Robinson's infinitesimal analysis is
merely instrumental rather than applicable. Yet in spite of Robinson's
techniques being applied in physics, probability, and economics, ET don't
bother to provide a meaningful analysis of even a single case in which these
techniques are used. Instead, ET produce page after page of speculations mainly
imitating Connesian chimera-type arguments `from first principles' against
Robinson. In an earlier paper Easwaran endorsed real applicability of the
sigma-additivity of measures, whereas the ET text rejects real applicability of
the axiom of choice, voicing a preference for ZF. Since it is consistent with
ZF that the Lebesgue measure is not sigma-additive, Easwaran is thereby walking
back his earlier endorsement. We note a related inaccuracy in the textbook

concurrency, conflict and causality. In this paper we present a theory of
minimisation for event structures. Working in a class of event structures that
generalises many stable event structure models in the literature (e.g., prime,
asymmetric, flow and bundle event structures), we study a notion of
behaviour-preserving quotient, referred to as a folding, taking (hereditary)
history preserving bisimilarity as a reference behavioural equivalence. We show
that for any event structure a folding producing a uniquely determined minimal
quotient always exists. We observe that each event structure can be seen as the
folding of a prime event structure, and that all foldings between general event
structures arise from foldings of (suitably defined) corresponding prime event
structures. This gives a special relevance to foldings in the class of prime
event structures, which are studied in detail. We identify folding conditions
for prime and asymmetric event structures, and show that also prime event
structures always admit a unique minimal quotient (while this is not the case
for various other event structure models).

knowledge about its state. However, we learn from quantum theory that it is
generally impossible to extract information without disturbing the state of the

issue of the interplay between information and disturbance for a general
operational probabilistic theory. The traditional notion of disturbance
considers the fate of the system state after the measurement. However, the fact
that the system state is left untouched ensures that also correlations are
preserved only in the presence of local discriminability. Here we provide the
definition of disturbance that is appropriate for a general theory. Moreover,
since in a theory without causality information can be gathered also on the
effect, we generalise the notion of no-information test. We then prove an
equivalent condition for no-information without disturbance-atomicity of the
identity-namely the impossibility of achieving the trivial evolution-the
identity-as the coarse-graining of a set of non trivial ones. We prove a
general theorem showing that information that can be retrieved without
disturbance corresponds to perfectly repeatable and discriminating tests. Based
on this, we prove a structure theorem for operational probabilistic theories,
showing that the set of states of any system decomposes as a direct sum of
perfectly discriminable sets, and such decomposition is preserved under system
composition. As a consequence, a theory is such that any information can be
extracted without disturbance only if all its systems are classical. Finally,
we show via concrete examples that no-information without disturbance is
independent of both local discriminability and purification.

galaxy Zw 229.015 using multi-epoch, multi-instrument and deep pointed
observations with XMM-Newton, Suzaku, Swift and NuSTAR. Spectral and temporal
variability are examined in detail on both the long (weeks-to-years) and short
(hours) timescales. A deep Suzaku observation of the source shows two distinct
spectral states; a bright-soft state and a dim-hard state in which changes in
the power law component account for the differences. Partial covering, blurred
reflection and soft Comptonisation models describe the X-ray spectra comparably
well, but the smooth, rather featureless, spectrum may be favouring the soft
Comptonisation scenario. Moreover, independent of the spectral model, the
observed spectral variability is ascribed to the changes in the power law
continuum only and do not require changes in the properties of the absorber or
blurred reflector incorporated in the other scenarios. The multi-epoch
observations between 2009 and 2018 can be described in similar fashion. This
could be understood if the primary emission is originating at a large distance
from a standard accretion disc or if the disc is optically thin and
geometrically thick as recently proposed for Zw 229.015. Our investigation
shows that Zw 229.015 behaves similar to sources like Akn 120 and Mrk 530, that
exhibit a strong soft-excess, but weak Compton hump and Fe K${\alpha}$
emission.

$\approx 1\,$% (LTP), or (almost) no H (VLTP). Since FTP stars exhibit
intershell material at their surface, spectral analyses establish constraints
for AGB nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution. We performed a spectral analysis

solar coronal structures, offering a promising tool for a seismological
diagnostics of the coronal plasma, including its thermodynamical properties.
The effect of damping of standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in the
solar coronal loops is investigated accounting for the field-aligned thermal
conductivity and a wave-induced misbalance between radiative cooling and some
unspecified heating rates. The non-adiabatic terms were allowed to be
arbitrarily large, corresponding to the observed values. The thermal
conductivity was taken in its classical form, and a power-law dependence of the
heating function on the density and temperature was assumed. The analysis was
conducted in the linear regime and in the infinite magnetic field
approximation. The wave dynamics is found to be highly sensitive to the
characteristic time scales of the thermal misbalance. Depending on certain
values of the misbalance time scales three regimes of the wave evolution were
identified, namely the regime of a suppressed damping, enhanced damping where
the damping rate drops down to the observational values, and acoustic
over-stability. The specific regime is determined by the dependences of the
radiative cooling and heating functions on thermodynamical parameters of the
plasma in the vicinity of the perturbed thermal equilibrium. The comparison of
the observed and theoretically derived decay times and oscillation periods
allows us to constrain the coronal heating function. For typical coronal
parameters, the observed properties of standing slow magnetoacoustic
oscillations could be readily reproduced with a reasonable choice of the
heating function.

degree assortativity, short average path lengths (small-world property) and
right-skewed but rarely power law degree distributions. On the other hand
homophily, defined as the propensity of similar agents to connect to each
other, is one of the most fundamental social processes observed in many human
and animal societies. In this paper we examine the extent to which homophily is
sufficient to produce the typical structural properties of social networks. To
do so, we conduct a simulation study based on the Social Distance Attachment
(SDA) model, a particular kind of Random Geometric Graph (RGG), in which nodes
are embedded in a social space and connection probabilities depend functionally
on distances between nodes. We derive the form of the model from first
principles based on existing analytical results and argue that the mathematical
construction of RGGs corresponds directly to the homophily principle, so they
provide a good model for it. We find that homophily, especially when combined
with a random edge rewiring, is sufficient to reproduce many of the
characteristic features of social networks. Additionally, we devise a hybrid
model combining SDA with the configuration model that allows generating
homophilic networks with arbitrary degree sequences and we use it to study
interactions of homophily with processes imposing constraints on degree
distributions. We show that the effects of homophily on clustering are robust
with respect to distribution constraints, while degree assortativity can be
highly dependent on the particular kind of enforced degree sequence.

  This article proposes a minimal step from successful first order momentum
method toward second order: online parabola modelling in just a single
direction: normalized $\hat{v}$ from momentum method. It is done by estimating
linear trend of gradients $\vec{g}=\nabla F(\vec{\theta})$ in $\hat{v}$
direction: such that $g(\vec{\theta}_\bot+\theta\hat{v})\approx \lambda (\theta
-p)$ for $\theta = \vec{\theta}\cdot \hat{v}$, $g= \vec{g}\cdot \hat{v}$,
$\vec{\theta}_\bot=\vec{\theta}-\theta\hat{v}$. Using linear regression,
$\lambda$, $p$ are MSE estimated by just updating four averages (of $g$,
$\theta$, $g\theta$, $\theta^2$) in the considered direction. Exponential
moving averages allow here for inexpensive online estimation, weakening
contribution of the old gradients. Controlling sign of curvature $\lambda$, we
can repel from saddles in contrast to attraction in standard Newton method. In
the remaining directions: not considered in second order model, we can
simultaneously perform e.g. gradient descent.
  There is also discussed its learning rate approximation as $\mu=\sigma_\theta

proposing three heuristics for parent selection that replace the fitness
function on the selection mechanism entirely. These heuristics complement
previous work by being inspired in the characteristics of the addition, Naive

is used to create an offspring. These heuristics use different similarity
measures among the parents to decide which of them is more appropriate given a
function. The similarity functions considered are the cosine similarity,
Pearson's correlation, and agreement. We analyze these heuristics' performance
against random selection, state-of-the-art selection schemes, and 18
classifiers, including auto-machine-learning techniques, on 30 classification
problems with a variable number of samples, variables, and classes. The result
indicated that the combination of parent selection based on agreement and
random selection to replace an individual in the population produces

Guthrie","Demystifying the Lagrangian of classical mechanics","Updated to reflect submission to journal",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics is widely applicable in
solving a vast array of physics problems encountered in the undergraduate and
graduate physics curriculum. Unfortunately, many treatments of the topic lack
explanations of the most basic details that make Lagrangian mechanics so
practical. In this paper, we detail the steps taken to arrive at the principle
of stationary action, the Euler-Lagrange equations, and the Lagrangian of
classical mechanics. These steps are: 1) we derive the Lagrange formalism
purely mathematically from the problem of the minimal distance between two
points in a plane, introducing the variational principle and deriving the
Euler-Lagrange equation; 2) we transform Newton's second law into an
Euler-Lagrange equation, proving that the Lagrangian is kinetic minus potential
energy; 3) we explain why it is important to reformulate Newton's law. To do
so, we prove that the Euler-Lagrange equation is astonishingly the same in any
set of coordinates. We demonstrate that because of this feature the role that
coordinates play in classical mechanics is much simpler and clearer in the
Lagrangian as compared to the Newtonian formulation. This is important because
the choice of coordinates is not relevant to physical reality, rather they are
arbitrarily chosen to provide a convenient way of analyzing a physical system.

stack $\mathbb{X}$ and a bundle $\mathcal{T}$ on it, via some moduli problem
(on $\mathbb{X}$ or $A = \operatorname{End}_{\mathbb{X}} \mathcal{T}$). The key
issue is, how does one incorporate some of the monoidal structure of
$\operatorname{Coh}(\mathbb{X})$ into the moduli problem. To this end, we
introduce a new moduli stack, the tensor stable moduli stack which generalises
the notion of the Serre-stable moduli stack. We then show how it can be used
both for stack recovery and the modular realisation problem for derived
equivalences. We also study the moduli of refined representations and how it
addresses these problems. Finally, we relate the two approaches when
$\mathcal{T}$ is a tilting bundle which is a direct sum of line bundles.

objective functions in optimization. By creating models which map genomes to
objective values, these models can estimate the performance of unknown inputs,
and so be used in place of expensive objective functions. Evolutionary
techniques such as genetic programming or neuroevolution commonly alter the
structure of the genome itself. A lack of consistency in the genotype is a
fatal blow to data-driven modeling techniques: interpolation between points is
impossible without a common input space. However, while the dimensionality of
genotypes may differ across individuals, in many domains, such as controllers
or classifiers, the dimensionality of the input and output remains constant. In
this work we leverage this insight to embed differing neural networks into the
same input space. To judge the difference between the behavior of two neural
networks, we give them both the same input sequence, and examine the difference
in output. This difference, the phenotypic distance, can then be used to
situate these networks into a common input space, allowing us to produce
surrogate models which can predict the performance of neural networks
regardless of topology. In a robotic navigation task, we show that models
trained using this phenotypic embedding perform as well or better as those
trained on the weight values of a fixed topology neural network. We establish
such phenotypic surrogate models as a promising and flexible approach which
enables surrogate modeling even for representations that undergo structural
changes.

of cosmic rays in galaxies. In this Letter, we present low-frequency
observations of the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4565 using the
LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR). With our deep 144-MHz observations, we obtain a
clean estimate of the emission originating from old cosmic-ray electrons (CRe),
which is almost free from contamination by thermal emission. We measured
vertical profiles of the non-thermal radio continuum emission that we fitted
with Gaussian and exponential functions. The different profile shapes
correspond to 1D cosmic-ray transport models of pure diffusion and advection,
respectively. We detect a warp in the radio continuum that is reminiscent of
the previously known HI warp. Because the warp is not seen at GHz-frequencies
in the radio continuum, its minimum age must be about 100 Myr. The warp also
explains the slight flaring of the thick radio disc that can otherwise be well
described by a Gaussian profile with an FWHM of 65 arcsec (3.7 kpc). The
diffusive radio halo together with the extra-planar X-ray emission may be
remnants of enhanced star-forming activity in the past where the galaxy had a
galactic wind, as GHz-observations indicate only a weak outflow in the last 40
Myr. NGC 4565 could be in transition from an outflow- to an inflow-dominated
phase.

  version under submission",,,,"cs.DS cs.DC cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flooding is among the simplest and most fundamental of all distributed
network algorithms. A node begins the process by sending a message to all its
neighbours and the neighbours, in the next round forward the message to all the
neighbours they did not receive the message from and so on. We assume that the
nodes do not keep a record of the flooding event. We call this amnesiac
flooding (AF). Since the node forgets, if the message is received again in
subsequent rounds, it will be forwarded again raising the possibility that the
message may be circulated infinitely even on a finite graph. As far as we know,
the question of termination for such a flooding process has not been settled -
rather, non-termination is implicitly assumed.
  In this paper, we show that synchronous AF always terminates on any arbitrary
finite graph and derive exact termination times which differ sharply in
bipartite and non-bipartite graphs. Let $G$ be a finite connected graph. We
show that synchronous AF from a single source node terminates on $G$ in $e$
rounds, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the source node, if and only if $G$ is
bipartite. For non-bipartite $G$, synchronous AF from a single source
terminates in $j$ rounds where $e < j \leq e+d+1$ and $d$ is the diameter of
$G$. This limits termination time to at most $d$ and at most $2d + 1$ for
bipartite and non-bipartite graphs respectively. If communication/broadcast to
all nodes is the motivation, our results show that AF is asymptotically time
optimal and obviates the need for construction and maintenance of spanning
structures like spanning trees. The clear separation in the termination times
of bipartite and non-bipartite graphs also suggests mechanisms for distributed
discovery of the topology/distances in arbitrary graphs.
  For comparison, we show that, in asynchronous networks, an adaptive adversary
can force AF to be non-terminating.

and rail lines, provide the backbone for movement and socioeconomic life in
cities. These networks can be understood as layers of a larger multiplex
transport network. Because most cities are car-centric, the most developed
layer is typically the street layer, while other layers can be highly
disconnected. To make urban transport sustainable, cities are increasingly
investing to develop their bicycle networks. However, given the usually patchy
nature of the bicycle network layer, it is yet unclear how to extend it
comprehensively and effectively given a limited budget. Here we develop
data-driven, algorithmic network growth strategies and apply them to cities
around the world, showing that small but focused investments allow to
significantly increase the connectedness and directness of urban bicycle
networks. We motivate the development of our algorithms with a network
component analysis and with multimodal urban fingerprints that reveal different
classes of cities depending on the connectedness between different network
layers. We introduce two greedy algorithms to add the most critical missing
links in the bicycle layer: The first algorithm connects the two largest
connected components, the second algorithm connects the largest with the
closest component. We show that these algorithms outmatch both a random
approach and a baseline minimum investment strategy that connects the closest
components ignoring size. Our computational approach outlines novel pathways
from car-centric towards sustainable cities by taking advantage of urban data
available on a city-wide scale. It is a first step towards a quantitative
consolidation of bicycle infrastructure development that can become valuable
for urban planners and stakeholders.

formation in different environments. We present the analysis of the massive
star population of the galaxies NGC 1326A, NGC 1425 and NGC 4548 using archival
Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images in the F555W and
F814W filters. Through high precision point spread function fitting photometry
for all sources in the three fields we identified 7640 candidate blue
supergiants, 2314 candidate yellow supergiants, and 4270 candidate red
supergiants. We provide an estimation the ratio of blue to red supergiants for
each field as a function of galactocentric radius. Using Modules for
Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) at solar metallicity, we defined the
luminosity function and estimated the star formation history of each galaxy. We
carried out a variability search in the V and I filters using three variability
indexes: the median absolute deviation, the interquartile range, and the
inverse von-Neumann ratio. This analysis yielded 243 new variable candidates
with absolute magnitudes ranging from Mv= -4 to -10 mag. We classified the
variable stars based on their absolute magnitude and their position on the
color-magnitude diagram using the MESA evolutionary tracks at solar
metallicity. Our analysis yielded 8 candidate variable blue supergiants, 12
candidate variable yellow supergiants, 21 candidate variable red supergiants,
and 4 candidate periodic variables.

predictions for their mass, metallicity and age. Prominent explanations for the
inflation involve enhanced magnetic fields generated by rapid rotation of the
star that inhibit convection and/or suppress flux from the star via starspots.
However, derived masses and radii for individual eclipsing binary systems often
disagree in the literature. In this paper, we continue to investigate low-mass
eclipsing binaries (EBs) observed by NASA's {\it Kepler} spacecraft, deriving
stellar masses and radii using high-quality space-based light curves and radial
velocities from high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We report masses and
radii for three {\it Kepler} EBs, two of which agree with previously published
masses and radii (KIC 11922782 and KIC 9821078). For the third EB (KIC
7605600), we report new masses and show the secondary component is likely fully
convective ($M_2 = 0.17 \pm 0.01 M_{\sun}$ and $R_2 = 0.199^{+0.001}_{-0.002}
R_{\sun}$). Combined with KIC 10935310 from Han et al. (2017), we find that the
masses and radii for four low-mass {\it Kepler} EBs are consistent with modern
stellar evolutionary models for M dwarf stars and do not require inhibited
convection by magnetic fields to account for the stellar radii.

  Recurrent Neural Networks","18 pages, 7 Figures, 1 Table",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG q-bio.QM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Surrogate testing techniques have been used widely to investigate the
presence of dynamical nonlinearities, an essential ingredient of deterministic
chaotic processes. Traditional surrogate testing subscribes to statistical
hypothesis testing and investigates potential differences in discriminant
statistics between the given empirical sample and its surrogate counterparts.
The choice and estimation of the discriminant statistics can be challenging
across short time series. Also, conclusion based on a single empirical sample
is an inherent limitation. The present study proposes a recurrent neural
network classification framework that uses the raw time series obviating the
need for discriminant statistic while accommodating multiple time series
realizations for enhanced generalizability of the findings. The results are
demonstrated on short time series with lengths (L = 32, 64, 128) from
continuous and discrete dynamical systems in chaotic regimes, nonlinear
transform of linearly correlated noise and experimental data. Accuracy of the
classifier is shown to be markedly higher than >> 50% for the processes in
chaotic regimes whereas those of nonlinearly correlated noise were around ~50%
similar to that of random guess from a one-sample binomial test. These results
are promising and elucidate the usefulness of the proposed framework in
identifying potential dynamical nonlinearities from short experimental time
series.

Computing(CC), Big Data (BD) and automation to gain better control over the
process of farming. As the use of these technologies in farms has grown
exponentially with massive data production, there is need to develop and use
state-of-the-art tools in order to gain more insight from the data within
reasonable time. In this paper, we present an initial understanding of
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the recent architectures of
state-of-the-art CNN and their underlying complexities. Then we propose a
classification taxonomy tailored for agricultural application of CNN. Finally,
we present a comprehensive review of research dedicated to applications of
state-of-the-art CNNs in agricultural production systems. Our contribution is
in two-fold. First, for end users of agricultural deep learning tools, our
benchmarking finding can serve as a guide to selecting appropriate architecture
to use. Second, for agricultural software developers of deep learning tools,
our in-depth analysis explains the state-of-the-art CNN complexities and points
out possible future directions to further optimize the running performance.

growth model from a single-time snapshot, MRI scan of a glioblastoma patient.
Tumor growth models are typically nonlinear parabolic partial differential
equations (PDEs). Thus, we have to generate a second snapshot to be able to
extract significant information from a single patient snapshot. We create this
two-snapshot scenario as follows. We use an atlas (an average of several scans
of healthy individuals) as a substitute for an earlier, pretumor, MRI scan of
the patient. Then, using the patient scan and the atlas, we combine
image-registration algorithms and parameter estimation algorithms to achieve a
better estimate of the healthy patient scan and the tumor growth parameters
that are consistent with the data. Our scheme is based on our recent work
(Scheufele et al, ""Biophysically constrained diffeomorphic image registration,
Tumor growth, Atlas registration, Adjoint-based methods, Parallel algorithms"",
CMAME, 2018), but apply a different and novel scheme where the tumor growth
simulation in contrast to the previous work is executed in the patient brain
domain and not in the atlas domain yielding more meaningful patient-specific
results. As a basis, we use a PDE-constrained optimization framework. We derive
a modified Picard-iteration-type solution strategy in which we alternate
between registration and tumor parameter estimation in a new way. In addition,
we consider an $\ell_1$ sparsity constraint on the initial condition for the
tumor and integrate it with the new joint inversion scheme. We solve the
subproblems with a reduced-space, inexact Gauss-Newton-Krylov/quasi-Newton
methods. We present results using real brain data with synthetic tumor data
that show that the new scheme reconstructs the tumor parameters in a more
accurate and reliable way compared to our earlier scheme.

In the method,
we have to calculate a stabilizing periodic orbit embedded in its chaotic
attractor. Thus, we cannot use this method in the case where a precise
mathematical model of the chaotic system cannot be identified. In this case,
the delayed feedback control proposed by Pyragas is useful. However, even in
the delayed feedback control, we need the mathematical model to determine a
feedback gain that stabilizes the periodic orbit. To overcome this problem, we
propose a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to the design of a
controller for the chaotic system. In recent years, model-free reinforcement
learning algorithms with deep neural networks have been paid much attention to.
Those algorithms make it possible to control complex systems. However, it is
known that model-free reinforcement learning algorithms are not efficient
because learners must explore their control policies over the entire state
space. Moreover, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms with deep neural
networks have the disadvantage in taking much time to learn their control
optimal policies. Thus, we propose a data-based control policy consisting of
two steps, where we determine a region including the stabilizing periodic orbit
first, and make the controller learn an optimal control policy for its
stabilization. In the proposed method, the controller efficiently explores its
control policy only in the region.

number versus strengths of disorder and correlation. In the short-ranged case
and when the correlation length is sufficiently small, we find that there
exists a critical value of the disorder strength, below which enhancement and
above which suppression of localization occurs as the correlation length
increases. In the region where the correlation length is larger, localization
is suppressed in all cases. A similar behavior is obtained for long-range
correlations as the disorder strength and the correlation exponent are varied.
Unlike in the case of a long-range correlated real random potential, no
signature of the localization transition is found in a long-range correlated
imaginary random potential. In the region where localization is enhanced in the
presence of long-range correlations, we find that the enhancement occurs in the
whole energy band, but is strongest near the band center. In addition, we find
that the anomalous localization enhancement effect occurs near the band center

circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and their ability to establish metastatic
niches. While the mechanisms regulating CTC homing in specific tissues are yet
to be elucidated, it is well documented that CTCs possess different size,
biological properties and deformability. A computational model is presented to
predict the vascular transport and adhesion of CTCs in whole blood. A
Lattice-Boltzmann method, which is employed to solve the Navier-Stokes equation
for the plasma flow, is coupled with an Immersed Boundary Method. The vascular
dynamics of a CTC is assessed in large and small microcapillaries. The CTC
shear modulus k ctc is varied returning CTCs that are stiffer, softer and
equally deformable as compared to RBCs. In large microcapillaries, soft CTCs
behave similarly to RBCs and move away from the vessel walls; whereas rigid
CTCs are pushed laterally by the fast moving RBCs and interact with the vessel
walls. Three adhesion behaviors are observed, firm adhesion, rolling and
crawling over the vessel walls, depending on the CTC stiffness. On the
contrary, in small microcapillaries, rigid CTCs are pushed downstream by a
compact train of RBCs and cannot establish any firm interaction with the vessel
walls; whereas soft CTCs are squeezed between the vessel wall and the RBC train
and rapidly establish firm adhesion. These findings document the relevance of
cell deformability in CTC vascular adhesion and provide insights on the
mechanisms regulating metastasis formation in different vascular districts.

approach the velocities of active agents close to a no-slip rigid wall in the
steady limit. The transient dynamics predict that contributions to the
velocities of the microswimmer due to bending resistance are generally more
pronounced than to shear resistance. Our results provide insight into the
control and guidance of artificial and synthetic self-propelling active

core-shell nanowire light-emitting diodes with highly stable emission in the UV
wavelength range. During the epitaxial growth of AlInN layer, an AlInN shell is
spontaneously formed, resulted in the reduced nonradiative recombination on
nanowire surface. The AlInN nanowires exhibit high internal quantum efficiency
of ~ 52% at room temperature for emission at 295nm. The peak emission
wavelength can be varied from 290 nm to 355 nm by changing the growth
condition. Moreover, significantly strong transverse magnetic (TM) polarized
emission is recorded which is ~ 4 times stronger compared to the transverse
electric (TE) polarized light at 295 nm. This study provides alternative
approach for the fabrication of new type of high-performance ultraviolet
light-emitters.

  corrections","26 pages","Eur. Phys. J. C (2019) 79:743","10.1140/epjc/s10052-019-7250-1",,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We investigate the holographic $p$-wave superconductors in the presence of
the higher order corrections on the gravity as well as on the gauge field side.
On the gravity side, we add the Gauss-Bonnet curvature correction terms, while
on the gauge field side we take the nonlinear Lagrangian in the form $F + b
F^2$, where F is the Maxwell Lagrangian and b indicates the strength of
nonlinearity. We employ the shooting method for the numerical calculations in
order to obtain the ratio of the critical temperature $T_c$ over $\rho^
{1/(d-2)}$. We observe that by increasing the values of the mass and the
nonlinear parameters the critical temperature decreases and thus the
condensation becomes harder to form. In addition, the stronger Gauss-Bonnet
parameter $\alpha$ hinders the superconducting phase in Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
Furthermore, we calculate the electrical conductivity based on the holographic
setup. The real and imaginary parts are related to each other by Kramers-Kronig
relation which indicates a delta function and pole in low frequency regime,
respectively. However, at enough large frequencies the trend of real part can
be interpreted by $Re[\sigma] = \omega^{(d-4)}$. Moreover, in holographic model
the ratio $\omega_g/T_c$ is always much larger than the BCS value $3.5$ due to
the strong coupling of holographic superconductors. In both gravity kinds,
decreasing the temperature or increasing the effect of nonlinearity shifts the
gap frequency toward larger values. Besides, the gap frequency is occurred at
larger values by enlarging the Gauss-Bonnet parameter. In general, the behavior
of conductivity depends on the choice of the mass, the nonlinear and the
Gauss-Bonnet parameters.
