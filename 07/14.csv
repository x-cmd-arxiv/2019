upstream gradients and small accretor size, which is relevant to neutron star
(NS) accretion in wind-fed Supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXBs). We present a
systematic exploration of the flow in this regime. When there are no upstream
gradients, the flow is always stable regardless of accretor size or Mach
number. For finite upstream gradients, there are three main types of behavior:
stable flow (small upstream gradient), turbulent unstable flow without a disk
(intermediate upstream gradient), and turbulent flow with a disk-like structure
(relatively large upstream gradient). When the accretion flow is turbulent, the
accretion rate decreases non-convergently as the accretor size decreases. The
flow is more prone to instability and the disk is less likely to form than
previously expected; the parameters of most observed SgXBs place them in the
regime of a turbulent, disk-less accretion flow. Among the SgXBs with
relatively well-determined parameters, we find OAO 1657-415 to be the only one
that is likely to host a persistent disk (or disk-like structure); this finding

extract well-localized i-vectors, each modelling merely the phonetic content

that the system attains state-of-the-art results even without recordings from
multiple handsets per speaker for training or enrolment. Similar conclusions
are drawn from our experiments on the RedDots corpus, where the same method is
evaluated on phrases. Finally, we report results with bottleneck features and

Co$_2$Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Al ($x=$ 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) Heusler alloys across the
ferromagnetic (FM) transition (T$_{\rm C}$). The Rietveld refinement of x-ray
diffraction patterns exhibit single phase cubic structure for all the samples.
The temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility $\chi$(T) data show a
systematic enhancement in the Curie temperature and effective magnetic moment
with Mn concentration, which is consistent with the Slater-Pauling behavior.
The M(H) isotherms also exhibit the FM ordering and the analysis of $\chi$(T)
data indicates the nature of the phase transition to be a second order, which
is further supported by scaling of the entropy curves and Arrott plot.
Interestingly, the Mn substitution causes an increase in the magnetic entropy
change and hence large relative cooling power for multi-stage magnetic
refrigerator applications. In order to understand the nature of the magnetic
phase transition we examine the critical exponents $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$
for the $x=$ 0.75 sample by the modified Arrott plot and the critical isotherm
analysis, which is further confirmed by Kouvel-Fisher method and Widom scaling
relation, respectively. The estimated values of $\beta=$ 0.507, $\gamma=$
1.056, $\delta=$ 3.084 are found to be close to the mean field theoretical
values. The renormalized isotherms (m vs h) corresponding to these exponent
values collapse into two branches, above and below T$_{\rm C}$ that validates
our analysis. Our results suggest for the existence of long-range FM
interactions, which decays slower than power law as $J(r)\sim r^{-4.5}$ for a 3
dimensional mean field theory.

followed by a long tail from the flat BEC asymptote, rather similar to what is
observed experimentally. For lattice systems we find that $T_{\text{BKT}}$ has
an absolute maximum of the order of $0.1 E_F$. We discuss how our results
compare with those derived from the Nelson Kosterlitz criterion based on the
mean field superfluid density and the approach to the transition from below.
While there is agreement in the strict mean-field BCS regime at weak coupling,
we find that at moderate pairing strength bosonic excitations cause a
substantial increase in $T_\text{BKT}$ followed by an often dramatic decrease
before the system enters the BEC regime.

ideal semifiltrations (a generalization of integrality over ideals). We begin
by reproving classical results, such as a version of the ""faithful module""
criterion for integrality over a ring, the transitivity of integrality, and the
theorem that sums and products of integral elements are again integral. Then,
we define the notion of integrality over an ideal semifiltration (a sequence
$\left( I_0,I_1,I_2,\ldots\right)$ of ideals satisfying $I_0 =A$ and $I_a I_b
\subseteq I_{a+b}$ for all $a,b\in\mathbb{N}$), which generalizes both
integrality over a ring and integrality over an ideal (as considered, e.g., in
Swanson/Huneke, ""Integral Closure of Ideals, Rings, and Modules""). We prove a
criterion that reduces this general notion to integrality over a ring using a
variant of the Rees algebra. Using this criterion, we study this notion further
and obtain transitivity and closedness under sums and products for it as well.
Finally, we prove the curious fact that if $u$, $x$ and $y$ are three elements
of a (commutative) $A$-algebra (for $A$ a ring) such that $u$ is both integral
over $A\left[ x\right]$ and integral over $A\left[ y\right]$, then $u$ is
integral over $A\left[ xy\right]$. We generalize this to integrality over ideal
semifiltrations, too.

in diffusion MRI (dMRI) research to elucidate the link between microstructural
properties and MR signal formation. For brain tissue, the research community
has developed the so-called Standard Model (SM) that has been widely used.
However, in clinically applicable acquisition protocols, the inverse problem
that recovers the SM parameters from a set of MR diffusion measurements using
pairs of short pulsed field gradients was shown to be ill-posed.
Multidimensional dMRI was shown to solve this problem by combining linear and
planar tensor encoding data. Given sufficient measurements, multiple choices of
b-tensor sets provide enough information to estimate all SM parameters.
However, in the presence of noise, some sets will provide better results. In
this work, we develop a framework for optimal experimental design of
multidimensional dMRI sequences applicable to the SM. This framework is based
on maximising the determinant of the Fisher information matrix, which is
averaged over the full SM parameter space. This averaging provides a fairly
objective information metric tailored for the expected signal but that only
depends on the acquisition configuration. The optimisation of this metric can
be further restricted to any subclass of desirable design constraints like, for
instance, hardware-specific constraints. In this work, we compute the optimal
acquisitions over the set of all b-tensors with fixed eigenvectors.

area, where several popular types of graphs are knowledge graphs, semantic
graphs and dependency graphs. Comparing with other data structures, such as
sequences and trees, graphs are generally more powerful in representing complex
correlations among entities. For example, a knowledge graph stores real-word
entities (such as ""Barack_Obama"" and ""U.S."") and their relations (such as
""live_in"" and ""lead_by""). Properly encoding a knowledge graph is beneficial to
user applications, such as question answering and knowledge discovery. Modeling
graphs is also very challenging, probably because graphs usually contain
massive and cyclic relations.
  Recent years have witnessed the success of deep learning, especially
RNN-based models, on many NLP problems. Besides, RNNs and their variations have
been extensively studied on several graph problems and showed preliminary
successes. Despite the successes that have been achieved, RNN-based models
suffer from several major drawbacks on graphs. First, they can only consume
sequential data, thus linearization is required to serialize input graphs,
resulting in the loss of important structural information. Second, the
serialization results are usually very long, so it takes a long time for RNNs
to encode them.
  In this thesis, we propose a novel graph neural network, named graph
recurrent network (GRN). We study our GRN model on 4 very different tasks, such
as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction and machine translation.
Some take undirected graphs without edge labels, while the others have directed
ones with edge labels. To consider these important differences, we gradually
enhance our GRN model, such as further considering edge labels and adding an
RNN decoder. Carefully designed experiments show the effectiveness of GRN on
all these tasks.

essential in database and information retrieval. Recently, there has been a
surge of interest in exploring efficient graph-based indices for the ANNS
problem. Among them, Navigating Spreading-out Graph (NSG) provides fine
theoretical analysis and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, we
find there are several limitations with NSG: 1) NSG has no theoretical
guarantee on nearest neighbor search when the query is not indexed in the
database; 2) NSG is too sparse which harms the search performance. In addition,
NSG suffers from high indexing complexity. To address the above problems, we
propose the Satellite System Graphs (SSG) and a practical variant NSSG.
Specifically, we propose a novel pruning strategy to produce SSGs from the
complete graph. SSGs define a new family of MSNETs in which the out-edges of
each node are distributed evenly in all directions. Each node in the graph
builds effective connections to its neighborhood omnidirectionally, whereupon
we derive SSG's excellent theoretical properties for both indexed and unindexed
queries. We can adaptively adjust the sparsity of an SSG with a hyper-parameter
to optimize the search performance. Further, NSSG is proposed to reduce the
indexing complexity of the SSG for large-scale applications. Both theoretical
and extensive experimental analyses are provided to demonstrate the strengths
of the proposed approach over the existing representative algorithms. Our code

learning it is prudent to ask which stages are required for accurate iris
recognition. Lojez et al. (IWBF 2019) recently concluded that the segmentation
stage is still crucial for good accuracy.We ask if normalization is beneficial?
Towards answering this question, we develop a new iris recognition system
called ThirdEye based on triplet convolutional neural networks (Schroff et al.,

observe equal error rates of 1.32%, 9.20%, and 0.59% on the ND-0405, UbirisV2,

that normalization is more important for less constrained environments.

unrealistic results due to the stochastic driving behaviors of drivers. This
paper is devoted to the development of a distinct car-following model where a
stochastic process is adopted to describe the time-varying random acceleration
which essentially reflects the random individual perception of driver behavior
with respect to the leading vehicle over time. In particular, we apply coupled
Langevin equations to model complex human driver behavior. In the proposed
model, an extended Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) stochastic process will be used to
describe the stochastic speed of the follower in response to the stimulus of
the leader. An important property of the extended CIR process is to enhance the
non-negative properties of the stochastic traffic variables (e.g. non-negative
speed) for any arbitrary model parameters. Based on stochastic process
theories, we derive stochastic linear stability conditions which, for the first
time, theoretically capture the effect of the random parameter on traffic
instabilities. Our stability results conform to the empirical results that the
traffic instability is related to the stochastic nature of traffic flow at the
low speed conditions, even when traffic is deemed to be stable from
deterministic models.

means that past trends in returns convey significant information on future

rough Heston models where the volatility coefficient is enhanced compared to
the square root characterizing Heston-type dynamics. Furthermore the Zumbach

either turn a feature on or off with a variable in a conditional statement.
Feature toggles are increasingly used by software companies to facilitate
continuous integration and continuous delivery. However, using feature toggles
inappropriately may cause problems which can have a severe impact, such as code
complexity, dead code, and system failure. For example, the erroneous
repurposing of an old feature toggle caused Knight Capital Group, an American
global financial services firm, to go bankrupt due to the implications of the
resultant incorrect system behavior. Aim: The goal of this research project is
to aid software practitioners in the use of practices to support software
development with feature toggles through an empirical study of feature toggle
practice usage by practitioners. Method: We conducted a qualitative analysis of
99 artifacts from the grey literature and 10 peer-reviewed papers about feature
toggles. We conducted a survey of practitioners from 38 companies. Results: We
identified 17 practices in 4 categories: Management practices, Initialization
practices, Implementation practices, and Clean-up practices. We observed that
all of the survey respondents use a dedicated tool to create and manage feature
toggles in their code. Documenting feature toggle's metadata, setting up the
default value for feature toggles, and logging the changes made on feature
toggles are also frequently-observed practices. Conclusions: The feature toggle
development practices discovered and enumerated in this work can help
practitioners more effectively use feature toggles. This work can enable future
mining of code repositories to automatically identify feature toggle practices.

inter-electrode vacuum gap has been studied as an effective way to mitigate a
large potential barrier due to space charge accumulation. However, existing
theoretical models do not fully consider the fundamental aspects of thermionic
emission when the inter-electrode gap shrinks to the nanoscale, which results
in underestimation of thermionic power generation for such small gaps. The
present work addresses this challenge by comprehensively modeling charge and
thermal transport processes with specific consideration of nanoscale gap
effects, such as image charge perturbation, electron tunneling, and near-field
thermal radiation. Carefully conducted energy balance analysis reveals that if
optimized, submicron-gap TEC can excel the micron-gap counterpart with $\sim$4
times the power output and ~5-10 % higher energy conversion efficiency.
Moreover, the high-temperature collector of the submicron-gap TEC, which is due
to thermionic and near-field radiative heat transfer, allows the addition of a
bottom-cycle heat engine to further enhance the power and efficiency when
combined. Electric field concentration due to engineered surface roughness is
also examined as a potential approach to produce an additional increase in
power generation. We believe that the present work provides a theoretical
framework for submicron-gap thermionic power generation as a promising energy
recycling scheme for high-quality heat sources.

with the explosively increasing Electronic Health Records (EHR). However, due
to the lack of transparency, behaviors of deep learning models are difficult to
interpret. Without trustworthiness, deep learning models will not be able to
assist in the real-world decision-making process of healthcare issues. We
propose a deep learning model based on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) to
predict uncertainty induced by data noise. The uncertainty is introduced to
provide model predictions with an extra level of confidence. Our experiments
verify that instances with high uncertainty are harmful to model performance.
Moreover, by investigating the distributions of model prediction and
uncertainty, we show that it is possible to identify a group of patients for
timely intervention, such that decreasing data noise will benefit more on the
prediction accuracy for these patients.

weighted models, i.e., localized persistent homology (LPH) and interactive
persistent homology (IPH). From the localized persistent homology models, we
have found that TMAO and urea have very different local topology. TMAO shows
local network structures. With the concentration increase, the circle elements
in these networks show a clear increase in their total numbers and a decrease
in their relative sizes. In contrast, urea shows two types of local topological
patterns, i.e., local clusters around 6 \AA~ and a few global circle elements
at around 12 \AA. From the interactive persistent homology models, it has been
found that our persistent radial distribution function (PRDF) from the
global-scale IPH has same physical properties as the traditional radial
distribution function (RDF). Moreover, PRDFs from the local-scale IPH can also
be generated and used to characterize the local interaction information. Other
than the clear difference of the first peak value of PRDFs at filtration size
4\AA, TMAO and urea also shows very different behaviors at the second peak

Properties of the ground state, the low-energy excitations and the

samples to reconstruct a smooth graph signal, is a fundamental problem in graph
signal processing (GSP). Previous works employ an unbiased least-squares (LS)
signal reconstruction scheme and select samples via expensive extreme
eigenvector computation. Instead, we assume a biased graph Laplacian
regularization (GLR) based scheme that solves a system of linear equations for
reconstruction. We then choose samples to minimize the condition number of the
coefficient matrix---specifically, maximize the smallest eigenvalue
$\lambda_{\min}$. Circumventing explicit eigenvalue computation, we maximize
instead the lower bound of $\lambda_{\min}$, designated by the smallest
left-end of all Gershgorin discs of the matrix. To achieve this efficiently, we
first convert the optimization to a dual problem, where we minimize the number
of samples needed to align all Gershgorin disc left-ends at a chosen
lower-bound target $T$. Algebraically, the dual problem amounts to optimizing
two disc operations: i) shifting of disc centers due to sampling, and ii)
scaling of disc radii due to a similarity transformation of the matrix. We
further reinterpret the dual as an intuitive disc coverage problem bearing
strong resemblance to the famous NP-hard set cover (SC) problem. The
reinterpretation enables us to derive a fast approximation scheme from a known
SC error-bounded approximation algorithm. We find an appropriate target $T$
efficiently via binary search. Extensive simulation experiments show that our
disc-based sampling algorithm runs substantially faster than existing sampling
schemes and outperforms other eigen-decomposition-free sampling schemes in

gradients require consistent mesoscopic methods accounting for both
hydrodynamic interactions and proper transport of energy. One such method is
dissipative particle dynamics with energy conservation (DPDE), which has been
used for various fluid systems with non-uniform temperature distributions.
Despite the success of the method, existing integration algorithms have shown
to result in an undesired energy drift, putting into question whether the DPDE
method properly captures properties of real fluids. We propose a modification
of the velocity-Verlet algorithm with local energy conservation for each DPDE
particle, such that the total energy is conserved up to machine precision.
Furthermore, transport properties of a DPDE fluid are analyzed in detail. In
particular, an analytical approximation for the thermal conductivity
coefficient is derived, which allows the selection of a specific value a
priori. Finally, we provide approximate expressions for the dimensionless
Prandtl and Schmidt numbers, which characterize fluid transport properties and
can be adjusted independently by a proper selection of model parameters, and
therefore, made comparable with those of real fluids. In conclusion, our
results strengthen the DPDE method as a very robust approach for the
investigation of mesoscopic systems with temperature inhomogeneities.

conventional spin-transfer torque for controlling next-generation magnetic

work, through a comprehensive study of high quality W/CoFeB/MgO and the

amorphous-W has a greater spin-orbit torque efficiency, the spin Hall
conductivity of $\alpha$-W

architectures and traditional approaches. Deep networks constructed in this way
benefit from the original known operator, have fewer parameters, and improved
interpretability. However, they do not yield state-of-the-art performance in

with novel admission control and a greedy-based heuristic algorithm, which is
shown to have a polynomial order of complexity with 13:66% global optimality

simulation results are carried out by considering different values of the

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic algorithm and
framework outperforms the existing ones by 34% on average in cost reduction.

procedure for characterization of topological order in an important set of
quantum entangled states, namely the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) states. To
this end, we introduce a particular quantum Hamiltonian which allows us to
consider the existence of a topological phase transition from quantum CSS
states to a magnetized state. We study the ground state fidelity in order to
find non-analyticity in the wave function as a signature of a topological phase
transition. Since hypergraphs can be used to map any arbitrary CSS state to a
classical spin model, we show that fidelity of the quantum model defined on a
hypergraph $H$ is mapped to the heat capacity of the classical spin model
defined on dual hypergraph $\tilde{H}$. Consequently, we show that a
ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition in a classical model is mapped to a
topological phase transition in the corresponding quantum model. We also show
that magnetization does not behave as a local order parameter at the transition
point while the classical order parameter is mapped to a non-local measure on
the quantum side, further indicating the non local nature of the transition.
Our procedure not only opens the door for identification of topological phases

also offers the potential to classify various topological phases through the
concept of universality in phase transitions.

dimensional wave scattering problems from quasi-periodic multilayered

computational cost of creating the direct solver scales $O(NI)$ where $N$ is
the number of discretization points on each interface and $I$ is the number of
interfaces. The bulk of the precomputation can be re-used for any choice of
incident wave. As a result, the direct solver can solve over 200 scattering
problems involving an eleven layer geometry with complex interfaces 100 times
faster than building a new fast direct solver from scratch for each new set of
boundary data. An added benefit of the presented solver is that building an
updated solver for a new geometry involving a replaced interface or a change in

first, we formulate the designing problem as a quartic polynomial minimization
problem with constant modulus constraints; second, by introducing auxiliary
phase variables, the polynomial minimization problem is equivalent to a
consensus nonconvex optimization problem; third, to achieve its good
approximate solution efficiently, we propose two efficient algorithms based on
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and parallel direction

approximate differential privacy. In contrast to centralized privacy scenarios
with a trusted curator, in the local setup anonymization must be guaranteed
already on the individual data owners' side and therefore must precede any data
mining tasks. Thus, the published anonymized data should be compatible with as
many statistical procedures as possible. We suggest adding Laplace noise and
Gaussian processes (both appropriately scaled) to kernel density estimators to
obtain approximate differential private versions of the latter ones. We obtain
minimax type results over Sobolev classes indexed by a smoothness parameter
$s>1/2$ for the mean squared error at a fixed point. In particular, we show
that taking the average of private kernel density estimators from $n$ different
data owners attains the optimal rate of convergence if the bandwidth parameter
is correctly specified. Notably, the optimal convergence rate in terms of the
sample size $n$ is $n^{-(2s-1)/(2s+1)}$ under local differential privacy and
thus deteriorated to the rate $n^{-(2s-1)/(2s)}$ which holds without privacy
restrictions. Since the optimal choice of the bandwidth parameter depends on
the smoothness $s$ and is thus not accessible in practice, adaptive methods for
bandwidth selection are necessary and must, in the local privacy framework, be
performed directly on the anonymized data. We address this problem by means of
a variant of Lepski's method tailored to the privacy setup and obtain general
oracle inequalities for private kernel density estimators. In the Sobolev case,
the resulting adaptive estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence at
least up to extra logarithmic factors.

length $2^{s+1}n$ can be obtained from self-dual cyclic code over $R$ of length
$2^sn$ and by a Gray map preserving orthogonality and distances from $R$ onto
$\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^2$.

  Condition in a Mixed Traffic Stream",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Connected Vehicles (CVs) have the potential to significantly increase the
safety, mobility, and environmental benefits of transportation applications. In
this research, we have developed a real time adaptive traffic signal control
algorithm that utilizes only CV data to compute the signal timing parameters
for an urban arterial in the near congested condition. We have used a machine
learning based short term traffic forecasting model to predict the overall
traffic counts in CV based platoons. Using a multi objective optimization
technique, we compute the green interval time for each intersection using CV
based platoons. Later, we dynamically adjust intersection offsets in real time,
so the vehicles in the major street can experience improved operational
conditions compared to loop detector based actuated coordinated signal control.
Using a 3 mile long simulated corridor of US 29 in Greenville, SC, we have
evaluated the performance of our CV based adaptive signal control. For the next
time interval, using only 5% CV data, the Root Mean Square Error of the machine
learning based prediction is 10 vehicles. Our analysis reveals that the CV
based adaptive signal control improves operational conditions in the major
street compared to the actuated coordinated scenario. Also, using only CV data,
the operational performance improves even for a low CV penetration (5% CV), and
the benefit increases with increasing CV penetration. We can provide
operational benefits to both CVs and non CVs with the limited data from 5% CVs,
with 5.6% average speed increase, and 66.7% and 32.4% reduction in average
maximum queue length and stopped delay, respectively, in major street
coordinated direction compared to the actuated coordinated scenario in the same
direction.

quantum-classical hybrid technique to solve combinatorial optimization problems
in near-term gate-based noisy quantum devices. In QAOA, the objective is a
function of the quantum state, which itself is a function of the gate
parameters of a multi-level parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). A classical
optimizer varies the continuous gate parameters to generate distributions
(quantum state) with significant support to the optimal solution. Even at the
lowest circuit depth, QAOA offers non-trivial provable performance guarantee
which is expected to increase with the circuit depth. However, the existing
analysis fails to consider non-idealities in the qubit quality i.e., short
lifetime and imperfect gate operations in realistic quantum hardware. In this
article, we investigate the impact of various noise sources on the performance
of QAOA both in simulation and on a real quantum computer from IBM. Our
analyses indicate that the optimal number of stages (p-value) for any QAOA
instance is limited by the noise characteristics (gate error, coherence time,
etc.) of the target hardware as opposed to the current perception that
higher-depth QAOA will provide monotonically better performance for a given
problem compared to the low-depth implementations.

occasional uncoupling methods of effecting identical synchronized states in low
dimensional, dissipative, diffusively coupled, chaotic flows that are otherwise
not synchronized when continuously coupled at the same coupling strength
parameter. In the process of our attempt to understand the mechanisms behind
the success of the occasional uncoupling schemes, we devise a hybrid between
the transient uncoupling and the stochastic on-off coupling, and aptly name it
the transient stochastic uncoupling---yet another stochastic occasional
uncoupling method. Our subsequent investigation on the transient stochastic
uncoupling allows us to surpass the effectiveness of the stochastic on-off
coupling with very fast on-off switching rate. Additionally, through the
transient stochastic uncoupling, we establish that the indicators quantifying
the local contracting dynamics in the corresponding transverse manifold are
generally not useful in finding the optimal coupling region of the phase space
in the case of the deterministic transient uncoupling. In fact, we highlight
that the autocorrelation function---a non-local indicator of the dynamics---of
the corresponding response system's chaotic time-series dictates when the
deterministic uncoupling could be successful. We illustrate all our heuristic
results using a few well-known examples of diffusively coupled chaotic
oscillators.
