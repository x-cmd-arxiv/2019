destroying the quantum information stored in their internal states. This is
achieved by designing state-insensitive Rydberg interactions between the
data-carrying atoms and cold auxiliary atoms. The resulting interactions give
rise to an effective phonon coupling, which leads to the transfer of heat from
the data atoms to the auxiliary atoms, where the latter can be cooled by
conventional methods. This can be used to extend the lifetime of quantum
storage based on neutral atoms and can have applications for long quantum
computations. The protocol can also be modified to realize state-insensitive
interactions between the data and the auxiliary atoms but tunable and
non-trivial interactions among the data atoms, allowing one to simultaneously
cool and simulate a quantum spin-model.

familiarity with quantum coding is an essential prerequisite for the

review, we provide an introductory guide to the theory and implementation of
quantum error correction codes. Where possible, fundamental concepts are
described using the simplest examples of detection and correction codes, the

multiparametric MR (mp-MR). Twenty-nine patients underwent pre-surgical mp-MR
followed by MR-guided stereotactic core biopsy. The locations of the biopsy
cores were identified in the pre-surgical images using stereotactic bitmaps
acquired during surgery. Feature matrices mapped the multiparametric voxel
values in the vicinity of the biopsy cores to the pathologic outcome variables
for each patient and logistic regression tested the individual and collective
predictive power of the MR contrasts. A non-parametric weighted k-nearest
neighbor classifier evaluated the feature matrices in a leave-one-out cross
validation design across patients. Resulting class membership probabilities
were converted to chi-square statistics to develop full-brain parametric maps,
implementing Gaussian random field theory to estimate inter-voxel dependencies.
Corrections for family-wise error rates were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg
and random field theory, and the resulting accuracies were compared. The
combination of all five image contrasts correlated with outcome (P<.001) for
all four microscopic variables. The probabilistic mapping method using
Benjamini-Hochberg generated statistically significant results (P<.05) for
three of the four dependent variables: 1) IDH1, 2) MGMT, and 3) microvascular
proliferation, with an average classification accuracy of 0.984 +/- 0.02 and an
average classification sensitivity of 1.567% +/- 0.967. The images corrected by
random field theory demonstrated improved classification accuracy (0.989 +/-

work has obtained two sets of expressions for 5 shear viscosity coefficients,
which can be ultimately classified into three basic components: parallel,
perpendicular and Hall components as one get same for electrical conductivity

we have obtained 2 sets of 5 shear viscosity components, whose final
expressions are in well agreements with earlier references, although a
difference in methodology or steps can be clearly noticed. Realizing the
massless results of viscosity and conductivity for Maxwell-Boltzmann,
Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distribution function, we have applied them for
massless quark gluon plasma and hadronic matter phases, which can provide us a
rough order of strength, within which actual results will vary during

the corresponding full switching effect of the spin valve is caused by the

The classical approach to

reaching such a conclusion. Classically, one makes additional assumptions on
the behavior of the map on the boundary of the simplex (for example, in the

  We follow Erel Segal-Halevi, Fr\'ed\'eric Meunier, and Shira Zerbib, and
replace the boundary condition by another assumption, which has the meaning in
economy as the possibility for a player to prefer an empty part in the segment
partition problem. We solve the problem positively when $n$, the number of
players that divide the segment, is a prime power, and we provide
counterexamples for every $n$ which is not a prime power. We also provide
counterexamples relevant to a wider class of fair or envy-free division

We consider charge $1/3$ ($\phi_1$) and $5/3$ ($\phi_5$) scalar leptoquarks
that can decay to a top quark and a charged lepton ($t\ell$) giving rise to a
resonance system of a boosted top and a high-$p_{\rm T}$ lepton. We introduce

map them to all possible scalar leptoquark models within the

the common perception, we find that the single production of top-philic

could be significant for order one $\phi t\ell$ coupling in certain scenarios.
We propose a strategy of selecting events with at least one hadronic-top and
two high-$p_{\rm T}$ same flavour opposite sign leptons. This captures events
from both pair and single productions. Our strategy can significantly enhance
the LHC discovery potential especially in the high-mass region where single

The hydrodynamic equations describing the bulk dynamics of the fluid as well as
the free surface boundary conditions depend explicitly on the parity breaking
non-dissipative odd viscosity term. We construct a variational principle in the
form of an effective action which gives both bulk hydrodynamic equations and
free surface boundary conditions. The free surface boundary conditions require
an additional boundary term in the action which resembles a $1+1D$ chiral boson
field coupled to the background geometry. We solve the linearized hydrodynamic
equations for the deep water case and derive the dispersion of chiral surface
waves. We show that in the long wavelength limit the flow profile exhibits an
oscillating vortical boundary layer near the free surface. The thickness of the
layer is controlled by the length scale given by the ratio of odd viscosity to
the sound velocity $\delta \sim \nu_o/c_s$. In the incompressible limit,
$c_s\to \infty$ the vortical boundary layer becomes singular with the vorticity
within the layer diverging as $\omega \sim c_s$. The boundary layer is formed
by odd viscosity coupling the divergence of velocity $\boldsymbol\nabla \cdot
\boldsymbol{v}$ to vorticity $\boldsymbol\nabla \times \boldsymbol{v}$. It
results in non-trivial chiral free surface dynamics even in the absence of
external forces. The structure of the odd viscosity induced boundary layer is
very different from the conventional free surface boundary layer associated

mainly due to the long distances and low bandwidth used. Moreover, the cost,
power, and size limitations restrict the integration of a GPS receiver in each
device. In this work, we introduce a novel received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) based localization solution for ultra narrow band (UNB) long-range IoT
networks such as Sigfox. The essence of our approach is to leverage the
existence of a few GPS-enabled sensors (GSNs) in the network to split the wide
coverage into classes, enabling RSSI based fingerprinting of other sensors
(SNs). By using machine learning algorithms at the network backed-end, the
proposed approach does not impose extra power, payload, or hardware
requirements. To comprehensively validate the performance of the proposed
method, a measurement-based dataset that has been collected in the city of
Antwerp is used. We show that a location classification accuracy of 80% is
achieved by virtually splitting a city with a radius of 2.5 km into seven
classes. Moreover, separating classes, by increasing the spacing between them,
brings the classification accuracy up-to 92% based on our measurements.
Furthermore, when the density of GSN nodes is high enough to enable
device-to-device communication, using multilateration, we improve the
probability of localizing SNs with an error lower than 20 m by 40% in our
measurement scenario.

maneuvers is essential for risk-aware maneuver planning. In this paper, a
statistical approach is proposed, which advantageously utilizes a set of
prototypical lane change trajectories to realize both early maneuver detection
and uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction for traffic participants.
Generation of prototype trajectories from real traffic data is accomplished by
Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. During clustering, the alignment of the
cluster prototypes to each other is optimized and the cohesion of the resulting
prototype is limited when two clusters merge. In the prediction stage, the
similarity of observed vehicle motion and typical lane change patterns in the
data base is evaluated to construct a set of significant features for maneuver
classification via Boosted Decision Trees. The future trajectory is predicted
combining typical lane change realizations in a mixture model. B-splines based
trajectory adaptations guarantee continuity during transition from actually
observed to predicted vehicle states. Quantitative evaluation results
demonstrate the proposed concept's improved performance for both maneuver and
trajectory prediction compared to a previously implemented reference approach.

widely investigated in research recently. Two research branches of the deep
learning models, the Generative Networks (GANs, VAE) and the Semantic
Segmentation, rely highly on the upsampling operations, especially the
transposed convolution and the dilated convolution. However, these two types of
convolutions are intrinsically different from standard convolution regarding
the insertion of zeros in input feature maps or in kernels respectively. This
distinct nature severely degrades the performance of the existing deep learning
engine or frameworks, such as Darknet, Tensorflow, and PyTorch, which are
mainly developed for the standard convolution. Another trend in deep learning
realm is to deploy the model onto edge/ embedded devices, in which the memory

Generative-model Engine for Edge-computing or HUGE2 for accelerating these two
special convolutions on the edge-computing platform by decomposing the kernels

multiplications. The methods we propose use much smaller memory footprint,
hence much fewer memory accesses, and the data access patterns also
dramatically increase the reusability of the data already fetched in caches,
hence increasing the localities of caches. Our engine achieves a speedup of
nearly 5x on embedded CPUs, and around 10x on embedded GPUs, and more than 50%

at $z\leq0.15$. Local underdensities in this redshift range have been
previously found based on luminosity density (LD) data and galaxy number
counts. Our main constraints on the possible local void using the Pantheon SN
Ia dataset are: redshift size of $z_{\rm size}=0.068^{+0.021}_{-0.030}$;
density contrast of $\delta\Omega_0/\Omega_0=-10.5_{-7.4}^{+9.3}\%$ between
16th and 84th percentiles. Investigating the possibility to alleviate the
$\sim9\%$ disagreement between measurements of present expansion rate $H_0$
coming from calibrated local SN Ia and high-$z$ cosmic microwave background
data, we find large local void to be a very unlikely explanation alone,
consistently with previous studies. However, the level of matter inhomogeneity
at a scale of $\sim$100Mpc that is allowed by SN Ia data, although not expected
from cosmic variance calculations in standard model of cosmology, could be the
origin of additonal systematic error in distance ladder measurements based on
SN Ia. Fitting low-redshift Pantheon data with a cut $0.023<z<0.15$ to the
$\Lambda$LTB model and to the Taylor expanded luminosity distance formula we
estimate that this systematic error amounts to $1.1\%$ towards the lower $H_0$
value. A test for local anisotropy in Pantheon SN Ia data yields null evidence.
Analysis of LD data provides a constraint on contrast of large isotropic void
$\delta\Omega_0/\Omega_0=-51.9\%\pm6.3\%$, which is in $\sim4\sigma$ tension
with SN Ia results. More data are necessary to better constrain the local

uncover the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariants $\nu_{n}$. We show that,

the boundary between topologically distinct phases, but instead these systems
support a new kind of bulk-boundary correspondence: The energy of the
topological domain wall states typically scales to zero as $1/w$, where $w$ is
the width of the domain wall separating phases with different topology.
Moreover, under specific circumstances we also find a faster scaling

compression leads to an isostructural phase transition above 20 GPa. In fact,
As coordination increases from threefold at room pressure to more than fivefold
above 20 GPa. This increase in coordination can be understood as the formation
of metavalent bonding at high pressure, which results in a progressive decrease
of the electronic and optical bandgap, an increase of the dielectric tensor and
Born effective charges, and a considerable softening of many high-frequency
optical modes with pressure. The formation of metavalent bonding may also
explain the behavior of other group-15 sesquichalcogenides under compression.
Moreover, our results suggest that group-15 sesquichalcogenides either show
metavalent bonding at room pressure or undergo a transition from p-type
covalent bonding at room pressure towards metavalent bonding at high pressure,
as a preceding phase towards metallic bonding at very high pressure.

examined. System analogs for bottom quarks are also constructed. Quantitative

diffraction by the complex telescope pupil not perfectly canceled by the
coronagraph, residual dynamic wavefront errors, chromatic wavefront errors, and
wavefront errors resulting from noncommon path aberrations (NCPAs). In a
previous work, we demonstrated the use of a Zernike wavefront sensor called
ZELDA for sensing NCPAs in VLT/SPHERE and their compensation. In the present
work, we move to the next step with the on-sky validation of NCPA compensation
with ZELDA. We start by reproducing previous results on the internal source and
show that the amount of aberration integrated between 1 and 15 cycles/pupil is
decreased by a factor of five, which translates into a gain in raw contrast of
between 2 and 3 below 300 mas. On sky, we demonstrate that NCPA compensation
works in closed loop, leading to an attenuation of the amount of aberration by
a factor of approximately two. However, we identify a loss of sensitivity for
the sensor that is only partly explained by the difference in Strehl ratio
between the internal and on-sky measurements. Coronagraphic imaging on sky is
improved in raw contrast by a factor of 2.5 at most in the ExAO-corrected
region. We use coronagraphic image reconstruction based on a detailed model of
the instrument to demonstrate that both internal and on-sky raw contrasts can
be precisely explained, and we establish that the observed performance after
NCPA compensation is no longer limited by an improper compensation for
aberration but by the current apodized-pupil Lyot coronagraph design.

To characterize the properties of stellar populations one needs to know the
fraction of stars forming at different metallicities. Knowing how this fraction
evolves over time is necessary e.g. to estimate the rates of occurrence of any
stellar evolution related phenomena (e.g. double compact object mergers, gamma
ray bursts). Such theoretical estimates can be confronted with observational
limits to validate the assumptions about the evolution of the progenitor system
leading to a certain transient. However, to perform the comparison correctly
one needs to know the uncertainties related to the assumed star formation
history and chemical evolution of the Universe.
  We combine the empirical scaling relations and other observational properties
of the star forming galaxies to construct the distribution of the cosmic star
formation rate density at different metallicities and redshifts. We address the
question of uncertainty of this distribution due to currently unresolved
questions, such as the absolute metallicity scale, the flattening in the star
formation--mass relation or the low mass end of the galaxy mass function. We
find that the fraction of stellar mass formed at metallicities <10% solar
(>solar) since z=3 varies by ~18% (~26%) between the extreme cases considered
in our study. This uncertainty stems primarily from the differences in the mass
metallicity relations obtained with different methods. We confront our results
with the local core-collapse supernovae observations. Our model is publicly
available.

from star-forming to quiescent, the green valley is considered a transitional
galaxy stage. The details of the processes that drive galaxies from
star-forming to passive systems still remain unknown. We developed a method
that estimates empirically the star formation quenching times-scales of green
valley galaxies, assuming an exponential decay model of the SFH and through a
combination of narrow and broad bands from J-PLUS and GALEX. We correlate these
quenching time-scales with the presence of bars. We find that the J-PLUS
colours F0395-g and F0415-g are sensitive to different SFH, showing, a clear
correlation with the Dn(4000) and H-delta,A spectral indices. We find that
quenching time-scales obtained with our new approach are in agreement with
those determined using spectral indices. We also find that galaxies with high
bar probability tend to quench their star formation slowly. We conclude that:
1) J-PLUS filters can be used to measure quenching timescales in nearby green
valley galaxies; and 2) the resulting star formation quenching time-scales are
longer for barred green valley galaxies. Considering that the presence of a bar
indicates that more violent processes (e.g., major mergers) are absent in host
galaxies, we conclude that the presence of a bar can be used as a morphological
signature for slow star formation quenching.

  candidate quasar PG1302-102 with multi-band Swift data","accepted in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa1643",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The bright quasar PG1302-102 has been identified as a candidate supermassive
black hole binary from its near-sinusoidal optical variability. While the
significance of its optical periodicity has been debated due to the stochastic
variability of quasars, its multi-wavelength variability in the ultraviolet
(UV) and optical bands is consistent with relativistic Doppler boost caused by
the orbital motion in a binary. However, this conclusion was based previously
on sparse UV data which were not taken simultaneously with the optical data.
Here we report simultaneous follow-up observations of PG1302-102 with the
Ultraviolet Optical Telescope on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in six
optical + UV bands. The additional nine Swift observations produce light curves
roughly consistent with the trend under the Doppler boost hypothesis, which
predicts that UV variability should track the optical, but with a ~2.2 times
higher amplitude. We perform a statistical analysis to quantitatively test this
hypothesis. We find that the data are consistent with the Doppler boost
hypothesis when we compare the the amplitudes in optical B-band and UV light
curves. However, the ratio of UV to V-band variability is larger than expected
and is consistent with the Doppler model, only if either the UV/optical
spectral slopes vary, the stochastic variability makes a large contribution in
the UV, or the sparse new optical data underestimate the true optical
variability. We have evidence for the latter from comparison with the optical
light curve from ASAS-SN. Additionally, the simultaneous analysis of all four
bands strongly disfavors the Doppler boost model whenever Swift V-band is
involved. Additional, simultaneous optical + UV observations tracing out
another cycle of the 5.2-year proposed periodicity should lead to a definitive
conclusion.

resolution length, the minimal distance by which two nearby colored charges in
a jet must be separated such that they engage with the plasma independently,
plays in understanding the modification of jet substructure due to interaction
with QGP. We identify a set of observables that are sensitive to whether jets
are quenched as if they are single energetic colored objects or whether the
medium that quenches them has the ability to resolve the internal structure of
the jet. Using the hybrid strong/weak coupling model, we find that although the
ungroomed jet mass is not suitable for this purpose (because it is more
sensitive to effects coming from particles reconstructed as a part of a jet
that originate from the wake that the jet leaves in the plasma), groomed
observables such as the number of Soft Drop splittings $n_{\rm SD}$, the
momentum sharing fraction $z_g$, or the groomed jet mass are particularly
well-suited to discriminate the degree to which the QGP medium resolves
substructure within a jet. In order to find the optimal grooming strategy, we
explore different cuts in the Lund plane that allow for a clear identification
of the regions of Soft Drop phase space that enhance the differences in the jet
substructure between jets in vacuum and quenched jets. Comparison with present
data seems to disfavor an ""infinite resolution length"", which is to say the
hypothesis that the medium interacts with the jet as if it were a single
energetic colored object. Our analysis indicates that as the precision of
experimental measurements of jet substructure observables and the control over
uncertainties in their calculation improves, it will become possible to
constrain the value of the resolution length of QGP, in addition to seeing how
the substructure of jets is modified via their passage through it.

entanglement entropy. For a family of theories in general dimensions, we relate
the universal terms in the entanglement entropy of the bulk theory with the
corresponding terms for the theory with a boundary. This relation imposes a
condition on certain boundary central charges. For example, in $2+1$

certain Lifshitz theories are simply related to those that arise when the
corner touches the boundary. We test our findings on the lattice, including a
numerical implementation of Neumann boundary conditions. We also propose an
ansatz, the boundary Extensive Mutual Information model, for a CFT with a

same bulk-boundary connection as Dirac fermions and certain supersymmetric CFTs
that have a holographic dual. Finally, we discuss how our results can be

paying particular attention to the MSTO. We create synthetic stellar
populations based on MESA stellar models to simulate observed Hubble Space
Telescope and Gaia star cluster data. We model the effect of rotation as a
non-parametric distribution, allowing for maximum flexibility. In our models
the slow rotators comprise the blueward, and fast rotators the redward portion
of the eMSTO. We simulate data under three scenarios: non-rotating eSF, a range
of rotation rates with a single age, and a combination of age and rotation
effects. We find that two of the five clusters (the youngest and oldest) favor
an age spread, but these also achieve the overall worst fits of all clusters.
The other three clusters show comparable statistical evidence between rotation
and an age spread. In all five cases, a rotation rate distribution alone is
capable of qualitatively matching the observed eMSTO structure. In future work,
we aim to compare our predicted Vsin(i) with observations in order to better
constrain the physics related to stellar rotation.

first light than before. Applying analytical models to such early emission, we
can constrain the progenitor stars properties. In this paper, we present
observations of SN2018fif (ZTF18abokyfk). The supernova was discovered close to
first light and monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory. Early spectroscopic observations suggest that the
progenitor of SN2018fif was surrounded by relatively small amounts of
circumstellar material (CSM) compared to all previous cases. This
particularity, coupled with the high cadence multiple-band coverage, makes it a
good candidate to investigate using shock-cooling models. We employ the
SOPRANOS code, an implementation of the model by Sapir & Waxman and its
extension to early times by Morag, Sapir & Waxman. Compared with previous
implementations, SOPRANOS has the advantage of including a careful account of
the limited temporal validity domain of the shock-cooling model as well as
allowing usage of the entirety of the early UV data. We find that the
progenitor of SN2018fif was a large red supergiant, with a radius of
R=744.0_{-128.0}^{+183.0} solar radii and an ejected mass of
Mej=9.3_{-5.8}^{+0.4} solar masses. Our model also gives information on the
explosion epoch, the progenitor inner structure, the shock velocity and the
extinction. The distribution of radii is double-peaked, with lower radii
corresponding to lower values of the extinction, earlier recombination times
and better match to the early UV data. If these correlations persist in future
objects, denser spectroscopic monitoring constraining the time of
recombination, as well as accurate UV observations (e.g. with ULTRASAT), will
help break the radius-extinction degeneracy and independently determine both.

the need to introduce a short-range lepton-number-violating operator at leading
order, confirming earlier findings. We demonstrate that such a short-range
operator is only needed in spin-singlet $S$-wave transitions, while
leading-order transitions involving higher partial waves depend solely on
long-range currents. Calculations are extended to include next-to-leading
corrections in perturbation theory, where to this order no additional
undetermined parameters appear. We establish a connection based on chiral
symmetry between neutrinoless double-beta decay and nuclear charge-independence
breaking induced by electromagnetism. Data on the latter confirm the need for a
leading-order short-range operator, but do not allow for a full determination
of the corresponding lepton-number-violating coupling. Using a crude estimate
of this coupling, we perform ab initio calculations of the matrix elements for
neutrinoless double-beta decay for $^6$He and $^{12}$Be. We speculate on the
phenomenological impact of the leading short-range operator on the basis of

improved understanding of chemical evolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes,
comparisons can be made between models and observations that could potentially
constrain the formation histories of comets. A $\chi^{2}$-method was used to
determine maximum likelihood surfaces for 14 different comets that formed at a
given time (up to 8 Myr) and place (out to beyond the CO iceline) in the
pre-solar nebula midplane. This was done using observed volatile abundances for
the 14 comets and the evolution of volatile abundances from chemical modelling
of disk midplanes. Considering all parent species (ten molecules) in a scenario
that assumed reset initial chemistry, the $\chi^{2}$ likelihood surfaces show a
characteristic trail in the parameter space with high likelihood of formation
around 30 AU at early times and 12 AU at later times for ten comets. This trail
roughly traces the vicinity of the CO iceline in time. The formation histories
for all comets were thereby constrained to the vicinity of the CO iceline,
assuming that the chemistry was partially reset early in the pre-solar nebula.
This is found, both when considering carbon-, oxygen-, and sulphur-bearing
molecules (ten in total), and when only considering carbon- and oxygen-bearing
molecules (seven in total). Since these 14 comets did not previously fall into
the same taxonomical categories together, this chemical constraint may be
proposed as an alternative taxonomy for comets. Based on the most likely time
for each of these comets to have formed during the disk chemical evolution, a
formation time classification for the 14 comets is suggested.

Lagrangians by including the most general three-form multiplets necessary to

context we find an obstruction to dualize all fluxes to three-forms in the
effective field theory. This implies that, generically, a single EFT cannot
capture all the membrane-mediated flux transitions expected from a string
theory construction, but only a sublattice of them. The obstruction can be
detected from the maximal number of three-forms per scalar in any
supermultiplet, and from the gaugings involving three-forms that appear in the
EFT. Some gaugings are related to the appearance of fluxes in the tadpole
conditions, and give a general obstruction. Others are related to the anomalous
axionic strings present in a specific compactification regime. We illustrate
the structure of the three-form Lagrangian in type II and F/M-theory setups,

sample taken at the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 3.773$~GeV~with the

The branching fractions of the first three decay modes are measured to be
${\cal B}(D^{0}\to\phi\pi^{0})=(1.168\pm0.028\pm0.028)\times10^{-3}$, ${\cal

the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. No
significant signal is observed of the decay $D^+\to\phi{K^+}$ and the upper

Action-based video summarization is performed by saving each person's action at

provides accurate multi human action recognition that easily used for
summarization of any action. Further, for other videos that can be collected

summarization is performed on the video sequences by summarizing the actions in

norms and practices to mitigate the harmful impacts of advances in machine
learning (ML). We focus particularly on the use of ML to create ""synthetic
media"" (e.g. to generate or manipulate audio, video, images, and text), and the
question of what publication and release processes around such research might
look like, though many of the considerations discussed will apply to ML
research more broadly. We are not arguing for any specific approach on when or
how research should be distributed, but instead try to lay out some useful
tools, analogies, and options for thinking about these issues.
  We begin with some background on the idea that ML research might be misused
in harmful ways, and why advances in synthetic media, in particular, are
raising concerns. We then outline in more detail some of the different paths to
harm from ML research, before reviewing research risk mitigation strategies in
other fields and identifying components that seem most worth emulating in the
ML and synthetic media research communities. Next, we outline some important
dimensions of disagreement on these issues which risk polarizing conversations.
  Finally, we conclude with recommendations, suggesting that the machine
learning community might benefit from: working with subject matter experts to
increase understanding of the risk landscape and possible mitigation
strategies; building a community and norms around understanding the impacts of
ML research, e.g. through regular workshops at major conferences; and

ideally be swift, scalable, non-invasive, and resulting in reliable magnetic
switching. Such requirements and in particular the reproducibility of altering
the vortex chirality and/or polarity are not yet met by magnetic vortex
switching via external magnetic fields, spin-polarized currents, spin waves, or
laser pulses. Here we demonstrate a novel packaged-skyrmion mediated vortex
switching process driven by a simple sequence of picosecond electrical field
pulses via magneto-electric interactions. Both the vortex chirality and
polarity show a well-defined reversal behaviour. The unambiguously repeated
switching between four different magnetic vortex states provides an
energy-efficient, highly localized and coherent control method for non-volatile
magnetic vortex-based information storage and handling.

of capturing three asymmetric behaviors of surface waves: (i) Surface waves
become short in wavelength at the leading edge and long at the trailing edge of
an underlying interfacial solitary wave. (ii) Surface waves propagate towards
the trailing edge with a relatively small group velocity, and towards the
leading edge with a relatively large group velocity. (iii) Surface waves become
high in amplitude at the leading edge and low at the trailing edge. These

The excitation evolves from confinement-dominated, to excitonic, to plasmonic
with increasing number of electrons at fixed density, and the threshold number
of electrons to produce a plasmon increases with density due to quantum
confinement. Exchange integrals (attractive electron-hole interactions) are
essential to properly describe excitons, and de-excitations (i.e.~avoidance of

called totally nonparallel if, for every distinct $x, y \in M$, the tangent
spaces at $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ contain no parallel lines. Given a manifold $M$, we
seek the minimum dimension $TN(M)$ such that there exists a totally nonparallel
immersion $M \to \mathbb{R}^{TN(M)}$. In analogy with the totally skew
embeddings studied by Ghomi and Tabachnikov, we find that totally nonparallel
immersions are related to the generalized vector field problem, the immersion
problem for real projective spaces, and nonsingular symmetric bilinear maps.
  Our study of totally nonparallel immersions follows a recent trend of
studying conditions which manifest on the configuration space $F_k(M)$ of
k-tuples of distinct points of $M$; for example, k-regular embeddings, k-skew
embeddings, k-neighborly embeddings, etc. Typically, a map satisfying one of
these configuration space conditions induces some $S_k$-equivariant map on the
configuration space $F_k(M)$ (or on a bundle thereof) and obstructions can be
computed using Stiefel-Whitney classes. However, the existence problem for such
conditions is relatively unstudied.
  Our main result is a Whitney-type theorem: every $n$-manifold $M$ admits a
totally nonparallel immersion into $\mathbb{R}^{4n-1}$, one dimension less than
given by genericity. We begin by studying the local problem, which requires a
thorough understanding of the space of nonsingular symmetric bilinear maps,
after which the main theorem is established using the removal-of-singularities
h-principle technique due to Gromov and Eliashberg. When combined with a recent
non-immersion theorem of Davis, we obtain the exact value $TN(\mathbb{R}P^n) =
4n-1$ when $n$ is a power of 2. This is the first optimal-dimension result for
any closed manifold $M \neq S^1$, for any of the recently-studied configuration
space conditions.

characterized by expensive black-box objective experiments or computer
simulations. Obtaining insight into the problem or performing subsequent
optimizations requires hundreds of thousands of evaluations of the objective
function which is most often a practically unachievable task. Gaussian Process
(GP) surrogate modeling replaces the expensive function with a
cheap-to-evaluate data-driven probabilistic model. While the GP does not assume
a functional form of the problem, it is defined by a set of parameters, called
hyperparameters. The hyperparameters define the characteristics of the
objective function, such as smoothness, magnitude, periodicity, etc. Accurately
estimating these hyperparameters is a key ingredient in developing a reliable
and generalizable surrogate model. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a
ubiquitously used Bayesian method to estimate these hyperparameters. At the GE
Global Research Center, a customized industry-strength Bayesian hybrid modeling
framework utilizing the GP, called GEBHM, has been employed and validated over
many years. GEBHM is very effective on problems of small and medium size,
typically less than 1000 training points. However, the GP does not scale well
in time with a growing dataset and problem dimensionality which can be a major
impediment in such problems. In this work, we extend and implement in GEBHM an
Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC) methodology for training the GP enabling
the modeling of large-scale industry problems. This implementation saves
computational time (especially for large-scale problems) while not sacrificing
predictability over the current MCMC implementation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and accuracy of GEBHM with ASMC on four mathematical problems and
on two challenging industry applications of varying complexity.

avoids any triangulation of the surface and uses a surface-independent

solving the Cahn-Hilliard equation numerically on implicitly defined surfaces

solutions that are difficult to validate are still the norm in practice, which
is of growing concern not only in mission-critical applications.
  In this note, we introduce Probabilistic Approximate Logic (PALO) as a logic
based on the notion of mean approximate probability to overcome conceptual and
computational difficulties inherent to strictly probabilistic logics. The logic
is approximate in several dimensions. Logical independence assumptions are used
to obtain approximate probabilities, but by averaging over many instances of
formulas a useful estimate of mean probability with known confidence can
usually be obtained. To enable efficient computational inference, the logic has
a continuous semantics that reflects only a subset of the structural properties
of classical logic, but this imprecision can be partly compensated by richer
theories obtained by classical inference or other means. Computational
inference, which refers to the construction of models and validation of logical
properties, is based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and hence another dimension where approximations
are involved.
  We also present the Logical Imagination Engine (LIME), a prototypical
implementation of PALO based on TensorFlow. Albeit not limited to the
biological domain, we illustrate its operation in a quite substantial
bioinformatics machine learning application concerned with network synthesis

human life, the issue of security and privacy has become important. In order to
enhance security and privacy on the Internet, many security protocols have been
developed. Unfortunately, the security analyzes that have been carried out on
these protocols show that they are vulnerable to one or few attacks, which
eliminates the use of these protocols. Therefore, the need for a security
protocol on the Internet of Things (IoT) has not yet been resolved.
  Recently, Khor and Sidorov cryptanalyzed the Wang et al. protocol and
presented an improved version of it. In this paper, at first, we show that this
protocol also does not have sufficient security and so it is not recommended to
be used in any application. More precisely, we present a full secret disclosure
attack against this protocol, which extracted the whole secrets of the protocol
by two communication with the target tag.
  In addition, Sidorv et al. recently proposed an ultralightweight mutual
authentication RFID protocol for blockchain enabled supply chains, supported by
formal and informal security proofs. However, we present a full secret
disclosure attack against this protocol as well.

bilayer graphene and the corresponding contribution to carrier scattering. At
the phonon $\Gamma$ point, electrons with energies less than 200 meV are
scattered predominantly by LA$^\prime$ and TA$^\prime$ modes while
higher-energy electron scattering is dominated by optical phonon modes. Based
on a two-temperature model, heat transfer from electrons with an initial
temperature of 2000 K to the lattice (phonons) with an initial temperature of
300 K is computed, and in the overall relaxation process, most of this energy
scatters into K-point phonon optical modes due to their strong coupling with
electrons and their high energies. A Drude model is used to calculate
photoconductivity for bilayer graphene with different doping levels. Good
agreement with prior experimental trends for both the real and imaginary
components of photoconductivity confirms the model's applicability. The effects
of doping levels and electron-phonon scattering on photoconductiviy are
analyzed. We also extract acoustic and optical deformation potentials from
average scattering rates obtained from density functional theory (DFT)
calculations and compare associated photoconductivity calculations with DFT
results. The comparison indicates that momentum-dependent electron-phonon
scattering potentials are required to provide accurate predictions.

are a well-known decision support tool, owing to their interpretability,
fundamental in safety-critical contexts such as medical diagnosis. However,
learning DTs from uncertain data leads to poor generalization, and generating
predictions for uncertain data hinders prediction accuracy. Several methods
have suggested the potential of probabilistic decisions at the internal nodes
in making DTs robust to uncertainty. Some approaches only employ probabilistic
thresholds during evaluation. Others also consider the uncertainty in the
learning phase, at the expense of increased computational complexity or reduced
interpretability. The existing methods have not clarified the merit of a
probabilistic approach in the distinct phases of DT learning, nor when the
uncertainty is present in the training or the test data. We present a
probabilistic DT approach that models measurement uncertainty as a noise
distribution, independently realized: (1) when searching for the split
thresholds, (2) when splitting the training instances, and (3) when generating
predictions for unseen data. The soft training approaches (1, 2) achieved a
regularizing effect, leading to significant reductions in DT size, while
maintaining accuracy, for increased noise. Soft evaluation (3) showed no
benefit in handling noise.

the electromagnetic field has a typical exponential decay that is interpreted

Cartesian product, together with induction on scales arguments. Many of these
estimates contained losses of the form $R^\varepsilon$ (or $\log^{O(1)} R$) for
some scale factor $R$. By further developing the heat flow method, and applying
it directly for the first time to the multilinear curved Kakeya and restriction

stays away from the endpoint. In particular, we establish global multilinear
restriction estimates away from the endpoint, without any curvature hypotheses
on the hypersurfaces.

the encoding and the character of the dataset being viewed. Unfortunately,
visualizations are often designed and evaluated without fully exploring how

similarity measure, the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM), for
testing the discriminability of a data visualization across a variety of
datasets. MS-SSIM is able to capture the similarity of two visualizations
across multiple scales, including low level granular changes and high level
patterns. Significant data changes that are not captured by the MS-SSIM
indicate visualizations of low discriminability and effectiveness. The
measure's utility is demonstrated with two empirical studies. In the first, we
compare human similarity judgments and MS-SSIM scores for a collection of
scatterplots. In the second, we compute the discriminability values for a set

effectiveness. In both cases, the analyses show that the computational measure
is able to approximate empirical results. Our approach can be used to rank
competing encodings on their discriminability and to aid in selecting

hyperbolic phonon polaritons with the key feature that the edge frequencies of

the target frame from input to the model. It also uses a new objective function
in training model that uses a correlation distance measure in penalty terms by
measuring dependency of the latent target features and the model (latent
features and enhanced features obtained from the DAE). Performance of the
proposed method was compared against a conventional model and a state of the
art model under both seen and unseen noisy environments of 7 different types of
background noise with different SNR levels (0, 5, 10 and 20 dB). The proposed
method also is tested using linear and non-linear penalty terms as well, where,
they both show an improvement on the overall average WER under noisy conditions
both seen and unseen in comparison to the state-of-the-art model.

decision tasks such as news article recommendation systems, web page ad
placement algorithms, and mobile health. Most of the existing algorithms have
regret proportional to a polynomial function of the context dimension, $d$. In
many applications however, it is often the case that contexts are
high-dimensional with only a sparse subset of size $s_0 (\ll d)$ being
correlated with the reward. We consider the stochastic linear contextual bandit
problem and propose a novel algorithm, namely the Doubly-Robust Lasso Bandit
algorithm, which exploits the sparse structure of the regression parameter as
in Lasso, while blending the doubly-robust technique used in missing data
literature. The high-probability upper bound of the regret incurred by the
proposed algorithm does not depend on the number of arms and scales with
$\mathrm{log}(d)$ instead of a polynomial function of $d$. The proposed
algorithm shows good performance when contexts of different arms are correlated
and requires less tuning parameters than existing methods.

and provides new opportunities in nowadays science and technology. The
strongest adversary in quantum sensing is decoherence due to the coupling
between the sensor and the environment. The dissipation will destroy the
quantum coherence and reduce the performance of quantum sensing. Here we show
that quantum sensing can be realized by engineering the steady-state of the
quantum sensor under dissipation. We demonstrate this protocol with a
magnetometer based on ensemble Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, while
neither high-quality initialization/readout of the sensor nor sophisticated
dynamical decoupling sequences is required. Thus our method provides a concise
and decoherence-resistant fashion of quantum sensing. The frequency resolution
and precision of our magnetometer are far beyond the coherence time of the
sensor. Furthermore, we show that the dissipation can be engineered to improve
the performance of our quantum sensing. By increasing the laser pumping,
magnetic signal in a broad audio-frequency band from DC up to 140 kHz can be
tackled by our method. Besides the potential application in magnetic sensing
and imaging within microscopic scale, our results may provide new insight for
improvement of a variety of high-precision spectroscopies based on other
quantum sensors.

gamma-ray spectrometer designed to space-qualify the new scintillation detector
material europium-doped strontium iodide (SrI2:Eu) and new silicon
photomultiplier (SiPM) technology. SIRI covers the energy range from 0.04-8 MeV
and was launched into 600 km sun-synchronous orbit on Dec 3, 2018 onboard
STPSat5 with a one-year mission to investigate the detector's response to
on-orbit background radiation. The detector has an active volume of 11.6 cm3
and a photo fraction efficiency of 50% at 662 keV for gamma-rays parallel to
the long axis of the crystal. Its spectroscopic resolution of 4.3% was measured
by the FWHM of the characteristic Cs-137 gamma-ray line at 662 keV. Measured
background rates external to the trapped particle regions are 40-50 counts per
second for energies greater than 40 keV and are largely the result of short-
and long-term activation products generated by transits of the SAA and the
continual cosmic-ray bombardment. Rate maps determined from energy cuts of the
collected spectral data show the expected contributions from the various
trapped particle regions. Early spectra acquired by the instrument show the
presence of at least 10 characteristic gamma-ray lines and a beta continuum
generated by activation products within the detector and surrounding materials.
As of April 2019, the instrument has acquired over 1000 hours of data and is
expected to continue operations until the space vehicle is decommissioned in
Dec. 2019. Results indicate SrI2:Eu provides a feasible alternative to
traditional sodium iodide and cesium iodide scintillators, especially for
missions where a factor-of-two improvement in energy resolution would represent
a significant difference in scientific return. To the best of our knowledge,
SIRI is the first on-orbit use of SrI2:Eu scintillator with SiPM readouts.

estimating spatial and non-spatial effects from large samples, such as millions

they are restrictive in that they assume an known spatial dependence structure.
To overcome this limitation, this study develops a fast AMM with the estimation
of spatial structure in residuals and regression coefficients together with
non-spatial effects. We rely on a Moran coefficient-based approach to estimate
the spatial structure. The proposed approach pre-compresses large matrices
whose size grows with respect to the sample size N before the model estimation;
thus, the computational complexity for the estimation is independent of the
sample size. Furthermore, the pre-compression is done through a block-wise
procedure that makes the memory consumption independent of N. Eventually, the
spatial AMM is memory-free and fast even for millions of observations. The
developed approach is compared to alternatives through Monte Carlo simulation
experiments. The result confirms the accuracy and computational efficiency of
the developed approach. The developed approaches are implemented in an R

we consider ten magnetic parameters characterizing size, distribution, and
non-potentiality of vector magnetic fields from Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites (GOES) X-ray flare data. The magnetic parameters are
classified into three types: the total unsigned parameters, the total signed
parameters, and the mean parameters. We divide the data into two sets
chronologically: 70% for training and 30% for testing. The empirical
relationships between the parameters and flaring rates are used to predict
flare occurrence probabilities for a given magnetic parameter value. Major
results of this study are as follows. First, major flare occurrence rates are
well correlated with ten parameters having correlation coefficients above 0.85.
Second, logarithmic values of flaring rates are well approximated by linear
equations. Third, the total unsigned and signed parameters achieved better
performance for predicting flares than the mean parameters in terms of
verification measures of probabilistic and converted binary forecasts. We
conclude that the total quantity of non-potentiality of magnetic fields is
crucial for flare forecasting among the magnetic parameters considered in this

paper, we tackle both problems simultaneously for the specific case of 2D

LOUPE (Learning-based Optimization of the Under-sampling PattErn). Our method
trains a neural network model on a set of full-resolution MRI scans, which are

anti-aliasing (a.k.a. reconstruction) model that computes a reconstruction,
which is in turn compared with the input. This formulation enables a

data-dependent, varying significantly with the imaged anatomy, and perform well
with different reconstruction methods. We present empirical results obtained
with a large-scale, publicly available knee MRI dataset, where LOUPE offered
superior reconstruction quality across different conditions. Even with an
aggressive 8-fold acceleration rate, LOUPE's reconstructions contained much of
the anatomical detail that was missed by alternative masks and reconstruction
methods. Our experiments also show how LOUPE yielded optimal under-sampling
patterns that were significantly different for brain vs knee MRI scans. Our

objective of the training framework is formulated as joint probability
distribution of the properties of the extracted points. The essential
properties are selected as sparsity, repeatability and discriminability which
are formulated by the probabilities. To maximize the objective efficiently,
latent variable is introduced to represent the probability of that a point
satisfies the required properties. Therefore, original maximization can be
optimized with Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM). Considering high
computation cost of EM on large scale image set, we implement the optimization
process with an efficient strategy as Mini-Batch approximation of EM (MBEM). In
the experiments both detector and descriptor are instantiated with fully

magnetized asymmetric nuclear matter are studied using a field theoretic model
for composite hadrons with quark (and antiquark) constituents. The medium
modifications of the decay widths of $\Upsilon (4S)$ to $B\bar B$ pair in
magnetized matter arise due to the mass modifications of the decaying $\Upsilon
(4S)$ as well as of the produced $B$ and $\bar B$ mesons. The in-medium masses
of the open bottom meson in magnetized nuclear matter are computed from their
interactions with the nucleons and the scalar mesons within a chiral effective
model. The mass modification of the $\Upsilon(4S)$ arises due to the medium
modification of a scalar dilaton field, which is introduced in the model to
simulate the gluon condensates of QCD. The charged $B^{\pm}$ mesons have
additional contributions from the Landau energy levels, leading to positive
shifts in their masses in the presence of a magnetic field. In the presence of
an external magnetic field, there are contributions to the masses of the $B$,
$\bar B$ mesons and $\Upsilon(4S)$ state (longitudinal component) due to the
pseudoscalar meson-vector meson (PV) mixing ($B-B^*$, $\bar B- \bar {B^*}$ and
$\Upsilon(4S)-\eta_b(4S)$ mixings), which are also considered in the present

the mass shifts of these mesons, which lead to appreciable modifications in the
decay widths of $\Upsilon (4S)$ to the neutral ($B^0 \bar {B^0}$) and the
charged ($B^+ B^-$) pairs in the presence of a magnetic field. These should
have observable consequence in the production of open bottom mesons and

labor-and time-intensive image capturing, we take advantage of the web and
download images from the reviews of several e-commerce websites where the
images are casually captured by consumers. Labels are assigned automatically by
the categories of e-commerce websites. Totally the Product-90 consists of more
than 140K images with 90 categories. Due to the fact that consumers may upload
unrelated images, it is inevitable that our Product-90 introduces noisy labels.
As the second contribution, we develop a simple yet efficient \textit{guidance

noisy supervision. The GL method first trains an initial teacher network with
the full noisy dataset, and then trains a target/student network with both
large-scale noisy set and small manually-verified clean set in a multi-task
manner. Specifically, in the stage of student network training, the large-scale
noisy data is supervised by its guidance knowledge which is the combination of
its given noisy label and the soften label from the teacher network. We conduct
extensive experiments on our Products-90 and public datasets, namely Food101,

incoming flow measurement of a utility-scale turbine at the high

(SLPIV) with natural snowflakes. The datasets include over a one-hour duration
of incoming flow with a field of view of 85 m (vertical) x 40 m (streamwise)
centered at 0.2 rotor diameter upstream of the turbine. The mean flow shows the
presence of the induction zone and a distinct region with enhanced vertical
velocity. Time series of nacelle sonic anemometer and SLPIV measured streamwise
velocity outside the induction zone show generally matched trends with
time-varying discrepancies potentially due to the induction effect and the flow
acceleration around the nacelle. These discrepancies between the two signals,
characterized by the sonic-SLPIV velocity ratio, is normally distributed and is
less than unity 85% of the time. The velocity ratio first decreases with
increasing wind speed up to around the rated speed of the turbine, then
plateaus, and finally rises with a further increase in wind speed. With
conditional sampling, the distribution of the velocity ratio shows that larger
yaw error leads to an increase in both the mean and the spread of the
distribution. Moreover, as the incident angle of the incoming flow changes from
negative to positive (i.e. from pointing downward to upward), the velocity
ratio first decreases as the angle approaches zero. With further increase of
the incidence angle, the ratio then plateaus and fluctuations are augmented.
Finally, our results show that the intensity of short-term velocity fluctuation
has a limited impact on the sonic-SLPIV velocity ratio.

analyzed. The cross-diffusion term has a stabilizing effect and leads to the
global-in-time existence of weak solutions. The limit of vanishing
cross-diffusion parameter is proved rigorously in the parabolic-elliptic and
parabolic-parabolic cases. When the signal production is sublinear, the
existence of global-in-time weak solutions as well as the convergence of the
solutions to those of the classical parabolic-elliptic Keller--Segel equations
are proved. The proof is based on a reformulation of the equations eliminating
the additional cross-diffusion term but making the equation for the cell
density quasilinear. For superlinear signal production terms, convergence rates
in the cross-diffusion parameter are proved for local-in-time smooth solutions
(since finite-time blow up is possible). The proof is based on careful
$H^s(\Omega)$ estimates and a variant of the Gronwall lemma. Numerical
experiments in two space dimensions illustrate the theoretical results and

augmented reality devices. However, there is still a long way for SS to be put
into practice as there are two essential challenges that need to be addressed:
efficiency and evaluation criterions for practical application. For specific
application scenarios, different criterions need to be adopted. Recall rate is
an important criterion for many tasks like autonomous vehicles. For autonomous
vehicles, we need to focus on the detection of the traffic objects like cars,
buses, and pedestrians, which should be detected with high recall rates. In
other words, it is preferable to detect it wrongly than miss it, because the
other traffic objects will be dangerous if the algorithm miss them and segment
them as safe roadways. In this paper, our main goal is to explore possible
methods to attain high recall rate. Firstly, we propose a real-time SS network
named Swift Factorized Network (SFN). The proposed network is adapted from
SwiftNet, whose structure is a typical U-shape structure with lateral
connections. Inspired by ERFNet and Global convolution Networks (GCNet), we
propose two different blocks to enlarge valid receptive field. They do not take
up too much calculation resources, but significantly enhance the performance
compared with the baseline network. Secondly, we explore three ways to achieve
higher recall rate, i.e. loss function, classifier and decision rules. We

demonstrated an efficient cooling mechanism well below limits imposed by the

given some other seen objects (training classes), by sharing information of
attributes between different objects. Attributes are artificially annotated for
objects and treated equally in recent ZSL tasks. However, some inferior
attributes with poor predictability or poor discriminability may have negative
impacts on the ZSL system performance. This paper first derives a
generalization error bound for ZSL tasks. Our theoretical analysis verifies
that selecting the subset of key attributes can improve the generalization
performance of the original ZSL model, which utilizes all the attributes.
Unfortunately, previous attribute selection methods are conducted based on the
seen data, and their selected attributes have poor generalization capability to
the unseen data, which is unavailable in the training stage of ZSL tasks.
Inspired by learning from pseudo relevance feedback, this paper introduces the
out-of-the-box data, which is pseudo data generated by an attribute-guided
generative model, to mimic the unseen data. After that, we present an iterative
attribute selection (IAS) strategy which iteratively selects key attributes
based on the out-of-the-box data. Since the distribution of the generated
out-of-the-box data is similar to the test data, the key attributes selected by
IAS can be effectively generalized to test data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that IAS can significantly improve existing attribute-based ZSL
methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and reduction of beamforming gain (RBG) in

optimization and theoretical computer science: Given a directed graph $G=(V,

terminals $K\subseteq V$, we need to output the minimum-cost arborescence in

Grandoni, Laekhanukit and Li, and independently Ghuge and Nagarajan, gave
quasi-polynomial time $O(\log^2k/\log \log k)$-approximation algorithms for the
problem, which are tight under popular complexity assumptions.
  In this paper, we consider the more general Degree-Bounded Directed Steiner
Tree (DB-DST) problem, where we are additionally given a degree bound $d_v$ on
each vertex $v \in V$, and we require that every vertex $v$ in the output tree
has at most $d_v$ children. We give a quasi-polynomial time $(O(\log n \log k),
O(\log^2 n))$-bicriteria approximation: The algorithm produces a solution with
cost at most $O(\log n\log k)$ times the cost of the optimum solution that
violates the degree constraints by at most a factor of $O(\log^2n)$. This is
the first non-trivial result for the problem.
  While our cost-guarantee is nearly optimal, the degree violation factor of
$O(\log^2n)$ is an $O(\log n)$-factor away from the approximation lower bound
of $\Omega(\log n)$ from the set-cover hardness. The hardness result holds even
on the special case of the {\em Degree-Bounded Group Steiner Tree} problem on
trees (DB-GST-T). With the hope of closing the gap, we study the question of
whether the degree violation factor can be made tight for this special case. We
answer the question in the affirmative by giving an $(O(\log n\log k), O(\log
n))$-bicriteria approximation algorithm for DB-GST-T.

Bohr failed to realize the full extent of the affinity of his way of thinking

Bohr. While Bohr's discovery of contextuality updates Kant's transcendental
philosophy in a way that leaves the central elements of the latter intact,
Kant's insight into the roles that our cognitive faculties play in constructing
physical theories can considerably alleviate the difficulties that Bohr's
writings present to his readers. And while throwing a QBist searchlight on
Bohr's writings can further alleviate these difficulties (as well as reveal the
presence in them of the salient elements of QBist thought), Bohr's writings can
in turn provide answers to important questions that QBism leaves unanswered
(and also allay some of QBism's excesses). In the final sections I confront the
two most impenetrable mysteries yet unearthed: making sense of quantum
mechanics, and the dual mystery of making sense of (i) the existence of
consciousness in a seemingly material world and (ii) the existence in
consciousness of a seemingly material world. Here the relevant arguments are
framed in the context of the philosophy of the Upanishads, according to which
we (as Schr\""odinger put it) ""are all really only various aspects of the One.""
There is no world that exists out of relation to consciousness, but there are
different poises of consciousness. In particular, there is a poise of
consciousness peculiar to the human species at this point in time, and there
are poises of consciousness that are yet to evolve (and that may be essential

life. The seasonal coastal hypoxia is commonly related to biological increased
respiration and to physical limited vertical turbulent exchange that is
associated with increased vertical stable density stratification. However, the
same stratification can support internal waves that may break and locally
generate turbulence. Here, we investigate the physics of internal wave motions
in saltwater Lake Grevelingen (SW-Netherlands) during warming in mid-spring.
Grevelingen is refreshed by weak tidal motions through an open sluice in its
dam to the North Sea. The outer North Sea has a surface tidal range of about 3
m, but the lake surface tidal range is negligible (<0.1 m). To quantify
vertical turbulent exchange, high-resolution temperature sensors were moored in
conjunction with a current meter in 36 m water depth for three days. The site
is known for anoxic conditions near the bottom in summer. While a 3-day, 30-m
mean eddy diffusivity of <[Kz]> = 4+/-2x10-5 m2 s-1 is found, the overall mean
turbulence dissipation rate (turbulent flux) is <[epsilon]> = 1.1+/-0.6x10-7 m2
s-3. Turbulent mixing occurs episodically, via near-surface cooling during
night and increased winds, via sparse shear-driven breaking of internal waves
at the main pycnocline, and via sheared near-bottom currents. Shear-driven
turbulence is not commonly found in fresh-water lakes. Just below the main
pycnocline around mid-depth a layer of weak turbulence is observed, as in
fresh-water lakes. The observed turbulent exchange is sufficient to warm the
near-bottom waters over the course of summer, but insufficient to prevent the
biology from over-consuming oxygen contents.

bolometric detectors (Li$_{2}$MoO$_{4}$ and TeO$_{2}$) capable of
discriminating surface $\alpha$ and $\beta$ interactions by exploiting
superconducting properties of Al film deposited on the crystal surface. We
report in this paper the results of tests on prototypes performed at CSNSM

superconducting Al film deposited on crystal surface to discriminate surface
$\alpha$ from bulk events, thus providing the detector with the required

future competitive double beta decay searches.

goal is to translate an image into multiple different domains. The target-only
characteristics are desired for translated images, while the source-only

retaining the characteristics of the source domain, which are incompatible with
the target domain. To address this issue, we propose a method called
Untraceable GAN, which has a novel source classifier to differentiate which

still retains the characteristics of the source domain. Furthermore, we take
the prototype of the target domain as the guidance for the translator to
effectively synthesize the target-only characteristics. The translator is
learned to synthesize the target-only characteristics and make the source
domain untraceable for the discriminator, so that the source-only
characteristics are erased. Finally, extensive experiments on three face
editing tasks, including face aging, makeup, and expression editing, show that
the proposed UGAN can produce superior results over the state-of-the-art

thresholds for down spin configurations. We show that, for every $K$, the
bipartite entanglement of all states with energy below the $(K+1)$-cluster
break-up satisfies a logarithmically corrected (or enhanced) area law. This
generalizes a result by Beaud and Warzel, who considered energies in the

  For general $K$, we find an upper logarithmic bound with pre-factor $2K-1$.
We show that this constant is optimal in the Ising limit $\Delta=\infty$. Beaud

averaging the enhanced area law becomes a strict area law, again for states in
the droplet regime. For the Ising limit with random field, we show that this
result does not extend beyond the droplet regime. Instead, we find states with
energies arbitrarily close to the $(K+1)$-cluster break-up whose entanglement

edges, and fix a set of $s$ sources $S\subseteq V$. We study the problem of
computing {\em almost shortest paths} (ASP) for all pairs in $S \times V$ in
both classical centralized and parallel (PRAM) models of computation. Consider
the regime of multiplicative approximation of $1+\epsilon$, for an arbitrarily
small constant $\epsilon > 0$ . In this regime existing centralized algorithms
require $\Omega(\min\{|E|s,n^\omega\})$ time, where $\omega < 2.372$ is the
matrix multiplication exponent. Existing PRAM algorithms with polylogarithmic
depth (aka time) require work $\Omega(\min\{|E|s,n^\omega\})$.
  Our centralized algorithm has running time $O((m+ ns)n^\rho)$, and its PRAM
counterpart has polylogarithmic depth and work $O((m + ns)n^\rho)$, for an
arbitrarily small constant $\rho > 0$. For a pair $(s,v) \in S\times V$, it
provides a path of length $\hat{d}(s,v)$ that satisfies $\hat{d}(s,v) \le
(1+\epsilon)d_G(s,v) + \beta \cdot W(s,v)$, where $W(s,v)$ is the weight of the
heaviest edge on some shortest $s-v$ path. Hence our additive term depends
linearly on a {\em local} maximum edge weight, as opposed to the global maximum
edge weight in previous works. Finally, our $\beta = (1/\rho)^{O(1/\rho)}$.
  We also extend a centralized algorithm of Dor et al. \cite{DHZ00}. For a
parameter $\kappa = 1,2,\ldots$, this algorithm provides for {\em unweighted}
graphs a purely additive approximation of $2(\kappa -1)$ for {\em all pairs
shortest paths} (APASP) in time $\tilde{O}(n^{2+1/\kappa})$. Within the same
running time, our algorithm for {\em weighted} graphs provides a purely
additive error of $2(\kappa - 1) W(u,v)$, for every vertex pair $(u,v) \in {V
\choose 2}$, with $W(u,v)$ defined as above.
  On the way to these results we devise a suit of novel constructions of
spanners, emulators and hopsets.

proposed first. The model calculates inter-aural time and level difference
cues, and compares them to those associated to free-field point-like sources.
The comparison is carried out using a particular distance functional that
replicates the increased uncertainty observed experimentally with inconsistent
inter-aural time and level difference cues. The model is validated by formal
listening tests, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.99. The model is then
used to predict localization uncertainty for stereophonic setups and a listener
in central and off-central positions. Results show that amplitude methods
achieve a slightly lower localization uncertainty for a listener positioned
exactly in the center of the sweet spot. As soon as the listener moves away
from that position, the situation reverses, with time-amplitude methods
achieving a lower localization uncertainty.

information from observations in total intensity by assuming a polarization
fraction. Our parametrization of the problem allows the reference prior to be
easily determined and also provides a natural method of including prior
information. The spectral index map is consistent with those found by others
between surveys at similar frequencies. Across the entire sky we find an
average temperature spectral index of $-2.99\pm0.03(\pm1.12)$ where the first
error term is the statistical uncertainty on the mean and the second error term
(in parentheses) is the extra intrinsic scatter in the data. We use a
clustering algorithm to identify pixels with actual detections of the spectral
index. The average spectral index in these pixels is $-3.12\pm0.03(\pm0.64)$
and then when also excluding pixels within $10^\circ$ of the Galactic plane we
find $-2.92(\pm0.03)$. We find a statistically significant difference between
the average spectral indices in the North and South Fermi bubbles. Only
including pixels identified by the clustering algorithm, the average spectral
index in the southern bubble is $-3.00\pm0.05(\pm0.35)$, which is similar to
the average across the whole sky. In the northern bubble we find a much harder

  Reduction","Accepted to be published in Proceedings of IEEE Winter Conference on
  Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many computer vision tasks over the years. However, this comes
at the cost of heavy computation and memory intensive network designs,
suggesting potential improvements in efficiency. Convolutional layers of CNNs
partly account for such an inefficiency, as they are known to learn redundant
features. In this work, we exploit this redundancy, observing it as the
correlation between convolutional filters of a layer, and propose an
alternative approach to reproduce it efficiently. The proposed 'LinearConv'
layer learns a set of orthogonal filters, and a set of coefficients that
linearly combines them to introduce a controlled redundancy. We introduce a
correlation-based regularization loss to achieve such flexibility over
redundancy, and control the number of parameters in turn. This is designed as a
plug-and-play layer to conveniently replace a conventional convolutional layer,
without any additional changes required in the network architecture or the
hyperparameter settings. Our experiments verify that LinearConv models achieve
a performance on-par with their counterparts, with almost a 50% reduction in
parameters on average, and the same computational requirement and speed at
inference.

spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases in three or two dimension, which follow from the
short-range behavior of the two-body physics. Besides the adiabatic energy
relations, the large-momentum distribution, the grand canonical potential and
pressure relation derived in our previous work for three-dimensional systems
{[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 060408 (2018){]}, we further derive high-frequency
tail of the radio-frequency spectroscopy and the short-range behavior of the
pair correlation function. In addition, we also extend the derivation to
two-dimensional systems with Rashba type of spin-orbit coupling. To simply
demonstrate how the spin-orbit-coupling effect modifies the two-body
short-range behavior, we solve the two-body problem in the sub-Hilbert space of
zero center-of-mass momentum and zero total angular momentum, and
perturbatively take the spin-orbit-coupling effect into account at short
distance, since the strength of the spin-orbit coupling should be much smaller
than the corresponding scale of the finite range of interatomic interactions.
The universal asymptotic forms of the two-body wave function at short distance
are then derived, which do not depend on the short-range details of interatomic
potentials. We find that new scattering parameters need to be introduced
because of spin-orbit coupling, besides the traditional $s$- and $p$-wave
scattering length (volume) and effective ranges. This is a general and unique
feature for spin-orbit-coupled systems. We show how these two-body parameters
characterize the universal relations in the presence of spin-orbit coupling.
This work probably shed light for understanding the profound properties of the
many-body quantum systems in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling.

  Descriptors Between Imaging Modalities",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Under difficult environmental conditions, the view of RGB cameras may be
restricted by fog, dust or difficult lighting situations. Because thermal
cameras visualize thermal radiation, they are not subject to the same
limitations as RGB cameras. However, because RGB and thermal imaging differ
significantly in appearance, common, state-of-the-art feature descriptors are
unsuitable for intermodal feature matching between these imaging modalities. As
a consequence, visual maps created with an RGB camera can currently not be used
for localization using a thermal camera. In this paper, we introduce the
Semantic Deep Intermodal Feature Transfer (Se-DIFT), an approach for
transferring image feature descriptors from the visual to the thermal spectrum
and vice versa. For this purpose, we predict potential feature appearance in
varying imaging modalities using a deep convolutional encoder-decoder
architecture in combination with a global feature vector. Since the
representation of a thermal image is not only affected by features which can be
extracted from an RGB image, we introduce the global feature vector which
augments the auto encoder's coding. The global feature vector contains
additional information about the thermal history of a scene which is
automatically extracted from external data sources. By augmenting the encoder's
coding, we decrease the L1 error of the prediction by more than 7% compared to
the prediction of a traditional U-Net architecture. To evaluate our approach,
we match image feature descriptors detected in RGB and thermal images using
Se-DIFT. Subsequently, we make a competitive comparison on the intermodal
transferability of SIFT, SURF, and ORB features using our approach.

population of sources with high energy hump peaking at TeV energies in their
broad-band spectral energy distributions. The observed gamma-ray emission from
these sources at GeV-TeV energies is described by unusual hard spectral
indices. The observed spectral and temporal characteristics of these sources
challenge the standard leptonic models for the broad-band emissions from
blazars. Therefore, such sources provide astrophysical sites to investigate
directly the particle acceleration, cooling of relativistic particles and
indirectly probe the cosmological quantities like extragalactic background
light (EBL) and intergalactic magnetic field (IMF) in the Universe. In this
study, we investigate the spectral properties of the gamma-ray emission from
EHSP blazars using observations from the Fermi-LAT catalogues (3FGL and 3FHL)
along with the TeV observations using ground based telescopes. The observed TeV
gamma-ray spectra are corrected for the EBL absorption using the most recent
and updated EBL models to determine the intrinsic spectrum at the source. The
intrinsic TeV spectra are combined with the MeV-GeV observations from the
Fermi-LAT to study the gamma-ray emission from EHSP blazars in the broad energy
band. The intrinsic gamma-ray spectra are then used to estimate the position of
high energy peak in the spectral energy distribution. We also present the
qualitative description for the observed spectral properties of EHSP blazars

Here, we study an information-theoretic principle that drives division of labor

together. We devise an on-line learning rule of this principle that learns a
partitioning of the problem space such that it can be solved by specialized
linear policies. We demonstrate the approach for decision-making problems whose

solved by combining the decision-makers optimally. The strength of the model is
that it is abstract and principled, yet has direct applications in

resonant interaction with light through local plasmonic charge oscillations.
Their ability to shape light at the nanoscale have made them important across a
multitude of areas, including biosensing, energy conversion and ultrathin flat
metaoptics. Yet another dimension of avenues is foreseen for dynamic
nanoantennas, ranging from tuneable metalenses for miniaturized medical devices
to adaptable windows that control radiation flows in and out of buildings.
However, enabling nano-optical antennas to be dynamically controllable remains
highly challenging and particularly so for traditional metals with fixed
permittivity. Here we present state-of-the-art conductive polymers as a new
class of organic plasmonic materials for redox-tuneable nano-optics. Through
experiments and simulations, we show that nanodisks of highly conductive
polymers can provide clear optical extinction peaks via excitation of dipolar
localised surface plasmon resonances. Resonance frequencies redshift with
increasing nanodisk aspect ratio, in agreement with analytical calculations
based on dipolar polarizability theory. We furthermore demonstrate complete
switching of the optical response of the organic nanoantennas by chemical
tuning of the polymer's redox state, which effectively modulates the material
permittivity between plasmonic and non-plasmonic regimes. Our results thereby
show that conductive polymer nanostructures can act as redox-tuneable plasmonic
nanoantennas, based on bipolaronic charge carriers rather than electrons as in
conventional metals. Future directions may investigate different polymers and
geometries to further widen the plasmonic spectral range (here around 0.8 to
3.6 {\mu}m) as well as different ways of tuning.

laparoscopic video and do not require additional sensor hardware are especially
attractive as they can be implemented at low cost in many scenarios. However,
surgical gesture recognition based only on video is a challenging problem that
requires effective means to extract both visual and temporal information from
the video. Previous approaches mainly rely on frame-wise feature extractors,
either handcrafted or learned, which fail to capture the dynamics in surgical
video. To address this issue, we propose to use a 3D Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to learn spatiotemporal features from consecutive video frames.
We evaluate our approach on recordings of robot-assisted suturing on a
bench-top model, which are taken from the publicly available JIGSAWS dataset.
Our approach achieves high frame-wise surgical gesture recognition accuracies
of more than 84%, outperforming comparable models that either extract only

separately. For the first time, these results demonstrate the benefit of
spatiotemporal CNNs for video-based surgical gesture recognition.

novel network architecture, named Action Semantics Network (ASN), that
explicitly represents such action semantics between agents. ASN characterizes
different actions' influence on other agents using neural networks based on the
action semantics between them. ASN can be easily combined with existing deep

significantly from the thin disk picture. We carry out theoretical
investigations on this topic by focusing on the Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent lines
produced from super-Eddington disks, and show that their line profiles are
shaped by the funnel geometry and wind acceleration. We also systematically
compare the Fe line profiles from super-Eddington thick disks to those from
thin disks, and find that the former are substantially more blueshifted and
symmetric in shape. These results are consistent with the observed Fe K$\alpha$
line from the jetted tidal disruption event, Swift J1644, in which a transient
super-Eddington accretion disk was formed out of stellar debris. Therefore,
careful analysis of the Fe K$\alpha$ line profile can be used to identify

three fundamental trade-offs of today's serverless computing model and their

isolation, and simple scheduling, it is possible to increase the overall

system size. Differently from most of the fracture descriptors, the maximum

with surface friction based on the double-folding approach for the
nucleus-nucleus potential. The effective interactions, as well as the resulting
potentials, are confronted with the ones obtained using the M3Y NN forces. Of
the four studied NN interactions, the Coulomb barrier appears for the
nucleus-nucleus potentials corresponding to the NL2 and HS parameter sets when
the exchange forces are added to the effective interaction. The heights and
radii of the barriers obtained using these two parameter sets are very close to
each other. The NL2 potential is used for analyzing the fusion cross-section
data for five reactions. The results of dynamical calculations are in good
agreement with the experimental data.

minimizing the difference of two convex functions. A recently proposed
accelerated version, termed BDCA for Boosted DC Algorithm, incorporates a line
search step to achieve a larger decrease of the objective value at each

practice. The solutions found by DCA are guaranteed to be critical points of
the problem, but these may not be local minima. Although BDCA tends to improve
the objective value of the solutions it finds, these are frequently just
critical points as well. In this paper we combine BDCA with a simple
Derivative-Free Optimization (DFO) algorithm to force the d-stationarity (lack
of descent direction) at the point obtained. The potential of this approach is
illustrated through some computational experiments on a Minimum-Sum-of-Squares

generalizations of the spin-1/2 Majumdar-Ghosh chain, the spin-1 $J_1-J_2$
Heisenberg chain, where $J_2$ is a next-nearest neighbor Heisenberg coupling,
and the spin-1 $J_1-J_3$ model, where $J_3$ refers to a three-site interaction
defined by $J_3\left[({\bf S}_{i-1}\cdot {\bf S}_i)({\bf S}_i\cdot {\bf
S}_{i+1})+\mathrm {H.c.}\right]$. Although both models are rigorously
equivalent to the Majumdar-Ghosh chain for spin-1/2, their physics appears to
be quite different for spin 1. Indeed, when all couplings are
antiferromagnetic, the spin-1 $J_1-J_2$ model undergoes an effective decoupling
into two next-nearest neighbour (NNN) Haldane chains upon increasing $J_2$,
while the $J_1-J_3$ chain undergoes a spontaneous dimerization similar to the
spin-1/2 Majumdar-Ghosh chain upon increasing $J_3$. By extending the phase
diagram to all signs of the couplings, we show that both the dimerized and the
NNN-Haldane phase are actually present in the $J_1-J_3$ model, the former one
adjacent to the Haldane one, the latter one to the ferromagneric one, with an
Ising transition between them. By contrast, the $J_1-J_2$ chain only has a
NNN-Haldane phase between the Haldane phase and the ferromagnetic phase for
positive $J_2$. In both cases, our DMRG data are consistent with a continuous
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition between the NNN-Haldane and the ferromagnetic
phases.

task, because both accuracy and efficiency (e.g., execution speed, memory
footprint or computational complexity) should all be taken into account.
However, most previous works pay too much attention to one-sided perspective,
either accuracy or speed, and ignore others, which poses a great limitation to
actual demands of intelligent devices. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a
novel lightweight architecture named Context-Integrated and Feature-Refined
Network (CIFReNet). The core components of CIFReNet are the Long-skip
Refinement Module (LRM) and the Multi-scale Context Integration Module (MCIM).
The LRM is designed to ease the propagation of spatial information between
low-level and high-level stages. Furthermore, channel attention mechanism is
introduced into the process of long-skip learning to boost the quality of
low-level feature refinement. Meanwhile, the MCIM consists of three cascaded
Dense Semantic Pyramid (DSP) blocks with image-level features, which is
presented to encode multiple context information and enlarge the field of view.
Specifically, the proposed DSP block exploits a dense feature sampling strategy
to enhance the information representations without significantly increasing the
computation cost. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark
datasets for object parsing including Cityscapes, CamVid, and Helen. As
indicated, the proposed method reaches a better trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency compared with the other state-of-the-art methods.

case where the nonsmooth function corresponds to a sum of non-convex functions,
resulting from composition between a strictly increasing, concave,
differentiable function and a convex nonsmooth function. The proposed variable
metric Composite Function Forward-Backward algorithm (C2FB) circumvents the
explicit, and often challenging, computation of the proximity operator of the
composite functions through a majorize-minimize approach. Precisely, each
composite function is majorized using a linear approximation of the
differentiable function, which allows one to apply the proximity step only to
the sum of the nonsmooth functions. We prove the convergence of the algorithm
iterates to a critical point of the objective function leveraging the
Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz inequality. The convergence is guaranteed even if the
proximity operators are computed inexactly, considering relative errors. We
show that the proposed approach is a generalization of reweighting methods,
with convergence guarantees. In particular, applied to the log-sum function,
our algorithm reduces to a generalized version of the celebrated reweighted
$\ell_1$ method. Finally, we show through simulations on an image processing
problem that the proposed C2FB algorithm necessitates less iterations to
converge and leads to better critical points compared with traditional
reweighting methods and classic forward-backward algorithms.

group-like elements and skew-primitives in geometric terms. This is done
through a more general study of connected and coconnected Hopf algebras inside
a braided fusion category $\mathcal{C}$. We describe such Hopf algebras as
orbits for the action of a reductive group on an affine variety. We then show
that the closed orbits are precisely the orbits of Nichols algebras, and that
all other algebras are therefore deformations of Nichols algebras. For the case
where the category $\mathcal{C}$ is the category $^G_G\mathcal{YD}$ of
Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a finite group $G$, this reduces the question of
generation by group-like elements and skew-primitives to a geometric question
about rigidity of orbits. Comparing the results of Angiono Kochetov and
Mastnak, this gives a new proof for the generation of finite dimensional
pointed Hopf algebras with abelian groups of group-like elements by
skew-primitives and group-like elements. We show that if $V$ is a simple object
in $\mathcal{C}$ and $\text{B}(V)$ is finite dimensional, then $\text{B}(V)$
must be rigid. We also show that a non-rigid Nichols algebra can always be
deformed to a pre-Nichols algebra or a post-Nichols algebra which is isomorphic
to the Nichols algebra as an object of the category $\mathcal{C}$.

in the THz range. Methods: The time-domain waveforms and the frequency-domain
spectra of reference samples of CO ice, deposited at a temperature of 28.5 K
and annealed to 33 K at different thicknesses, have been recorded. A new
algorithm is developed to reconstruct the real and imaginary parts of the

especially when the sample size is limited. Several earlier studies have shown
that the shrinkage of model coefficients can reduce overfitting of the
prediction model and subsequently result in better predictive performance on
average. In this simulation study, we aimed to investigate the variability of
regression shrinkage on predictive performance for a binary outcome, with focus
on the calibration slope. The slope indicates whether risk predictions are too
extreme (slope < 1) or not extreme enough (slope > 1). We investigated the
following shrinkage methods in comparison to standard maximum likelihood
estimation: uniform shrinkage (likelihood-based and bootstrap-based), ridge
regression, penalized maximum likelihood, LASSO regression, adaptive LASSO,
non-negative garrote, and Firth's correction. There were three main findings.
First, shrinkage improved calibration slopes on average. Second, the
between-sample variability of calibration slopes was often increased relative
to maximum likelihood. Among the shrinkage methods, the bootstrap-based uniform
shrinkage worked well overall. In contrast to other shrinkage approaches,
Firth's correction had only a small shrinkage effect but did so with low
variability. Third, the correlation between the estimated shrinkage and the
optimal shrinkage to remove overfitting was typically negative. Hence, although
shrinkage improved predictions on average, it often worked poorly in individual
datasets, in particular when shrinkage was most needed. The observed
variability of shrinkage methods implies that these methods do not solve
problems associated with small sample size or low number of events per
variable.

entanglement witness is a widely used tool for its detection. In experiments
the prepared state generally deviates from the target state due to some noise.
Normally the white noise model is applied to quantifying such derivation and in
the same time reveals the robustness of the witness. However, there may exist
other kind of noise, in which the coherent noise can dramatically ""rotate"" the
prepared state. In this way, the coherent noise is likely to lead to a failure
of the detection, even though the underlying state is actually entangled. In
this work, we propose an efficient entanglement detection protocol for
$N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states. The protocol can
eliminate the effect of the coherent noise and in the same time feedback the
corresponding noise parameters, which are beneficial to further improvements on
the experiment system. In particular, we consider two experiment-relevant
coherent noise models, one is from the unconscious phase accumulation on $N$
qubits, the other is from the rotation on the control qubit. The protocol
effectively realizes a family of entanglement witnesses by postprocessing the
measurement results from $N+2$ local measurement settings, which only adds one
more setting than the original witness specialized for the GHZ state. Moreover,
by considering the trade-off between the detection efficiency and the
white-noise robustness, we further reduce the number of local measurements to 3
without altering the performance on the coherent noise. Our protocol can
enhance the entanglement detection under coherent noises and act as a benchmark
for the state-of-the-art quantum devices.

large $N_c$ expansion. From the subleading $N_c$ corrections, we can also infer
the $N_f$ dependence, that we use to extract the value of the low-energy

on such a scenario. We present the first three-dimensional grid-based radiative
hydrodynamic simulations of direct collisions between infalling gas streams and
a $4 \times 10^6~\text{M}_\odot$ SMBH, using ray-tracing to incorporate
radiation consistent with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We assume inflow
masses of $ \approx 10^5~\text{M}_\odot$ and explore radiation fields of 10%
and 100% of the Eddington luminosity ($L_\text{edd}$). We follow our models to
the point of central gas disc formation preceding star formation and use the
Toomre Q parameter ($Q_T$) to test for gravitational instability. We find that
radiation pressure from UV photons inhibits inflow. Yet, for weak radiation
fields, a central disc forms on timescales similar to that of models without
feedback. Average densities of $> 10^{8}~\text{cm}^{-3}$ limit photo-heating to
the disc surface allowing for $Q_T\approx1$. For strong radiation fields, the
disc forms more gradually resulting in lower surface densities and larger $Q_T$
values. Mass accretion rates in our models are consistent with 1%--60% of the
Eddington limit, thus we conclude that it is unlikely that radiative feedback
from AGN activity would inhibit circumnuclear star formation arising from a
massive inflow event.

  The aim of the paper is to present new evolutionary models, based on the MESA
package, that include the internal structure constants (k$_2$, k$_3$, and
k$_4$), the radius of gyration, and the gravitational potential energy for
configurations computed from the pre-main-sequence (PMS) up to the first ascent
giant branch or beyond. The calculations are available for the three
metallicities [Fe/H]= 0.00, -0.50, and -1.00, which take the recent
investigations in less metallic environments into account. This new set of
models replaces the old ones, published about 15 years ago, using the code
GRANADA.
  Core overshooting was taken into account using the mass-f$_{ov}$
relationship, which was derived semi-empirically for models more massive than
1.2 M$_{\odot}$. The differential equations governing the apsidal motion
constants, moment of inertia, and the gravitational potential energy were
integrated simultaneously through a fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with a

only known planetary system with both a transiting hot-Jupiter and a
cold-Jupiter candidate (CVSO 30 b and c). We analyzed archival ROSAT, Chandra,

our modeling, CVSO 30 shows a quiescent X-ray luminosity of about 8e29 erg/s.
The X-ray absorbing column is consistent with interstellar absorption.
XMM-Newton observed a flare, during which a transit of the candidate CVSO 30 b
was expected, but no significant transit-induced variation in the X-ray flux is
detectable. While the hot-Jupiter candidate CVSO 30 b has continuously been
undergoing mass loss powered by the high-energy irradiation, we conclude that
its evaporation lifetime is considerably longer than the estimated stellar age
of 2.6 Myr.

Unfortunately, training multiple networks jointly to communicate to achieve a

given significance level $\alpha\in(0,1)$, there is an asymptotically optimal

leading error term for the normal approximation vanishes for all values
$\rho\in(-1,1)$ of the correlation coefficient.
  This general result is then applied to the bivariate normal (BVN) model of
dependence and to what is referred to in this paper as the SquareV model. In
the BVN model, Pearson's $R$ turns out to be asymptotically optimal for a
rather unusual significance level $\alpha\approx0.240$, whereas Fisher's
transform $R_F$ of $R$ is asymptotically optimal for the limit significance
level $\alpha=0$. In the SquareV model, Pearson's $R$ is asymptotically optimal
for a still rather high significance level $\alpha\approx0.159$, whereas
Fisher's transform $R_F$ of $R$ is not asymptotically optimal for any
$\alpha\in[0,1]$. Moreover, it is shown that in both the BVN model and the
SquareV model, the transform optimal for a given value of $\alpha$ is in fact
asymptotically better than $R$ and $R_F$ in wide ranges of values of the
significance level, including $\alpha$ itself.
  Extensive computer simulations for the BVN and SquareV models of dependence
are presented, which suggest that, for sample sizes $n\ge100$ and significance
levels $\alpha\in\{0.01,0.05\}$, the mentioned asymptotically optimal transform

ensuring their fixed quality of service (QoS), e.g., the amount of computing

effectively to improve the performance of the classifier. Semi-supervised
support vector machine (S$^3$VM) is one of the most appealing methods for SSL,
but scaling up S$^3$VM for kernel learning is still an open problem. Recently,
a doubly stochastic gradient (DSG) algorithm has been proposed to achieve
efficient and scalable training for kernel methods. However, the algorithm and
theoretical analysis of DSG are developed based on the convexity assumption
which makes them incompetent for non-convex problems such as S$^3$VM. To
address this problem, in this paper, we propose a triply stochastic gradient
algorithm for S$^3$VM, called TSGS$^3$VM. Specifically, to handle two types of
data instances involved in S$^3$VM, TSGS$^3$VM samples a labeled instance and
an unlabeled instance as well with the random features in each iteration to
compute a triply stochastic gradient. We use the approximated gradient to
update the solution. More importantly, we establish new theoretic analysis for
TSGS$^3$VM which guarantees that TSGS$^3$VM can converge to a stationary point.
Extensive experimental results on a variety of datasets demonstrate that
TSGS$^3$VM is much more efficient and scalable than existing S$^3$VM
algorithms.

a spatially resolved Mass-Metallicity Relation (rMZR) is now well established

seem to be common in local disc galaxies. These observations suggest that
galaxy formation is a self-regulating process, and provide constraints for
galaxy evolution models. Studying the evolution of these relations at higher
redshifts is still however very challenging. In this paper, we analyse three
gravitationally lensed galaxies at z = 0.6, 0.7 and 1, observed with MUSE and
SINFONI. These galaxies are highly magnified by galaxy clusters, which allow us
to observe resolved scaling relations and metallicity gradients on physical
scales of a couple of hundred parsecs, comparable to studies of local galaxies.
We confirm that the rSFMS is already in place at these redshifts on sub-kpc
scales, and establish, for the first time, the existence of the rMZR at higher
redshifts. We develop a forward-modelling approach to fit 2D metallicity
gradients of multiply imaged lensed galaxies in the image plane, and derive
gradients of -0.027+/-0.003, -0.019+/-0.003 and -0.039+/-0.060 dex/kpc. Despite
the fact that these are clumpy galaxies, typical of high redshift discs, the
metallicity variations in the galaxies are well described by global linear
gradients, and we do not see any difference in metallicity associated with the

Convolutional Networks (FCNs) have emerged as powerful segmentation models
achieving state-of-the-art results in various medical image datasets. Network
architectures are usually designed manually for a specific segmentation task so
applying them to other medical datasets requires extensive experience and time.
Moreover, the segmentation requires handling large volumetric data that results
in big and complex architectures. Recently, methods that automatically design
neural networks for medical image segmentation have been presented; however,
most approaches either do not fully consider volumetric information or do not
optimize the size of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-adaptive 2D-3D ensemble of FCNs for medical image segmentation that
incorporates volumetric information and optimizes both the model's performance
and size. The model is composed of an ensemble of a 2D FCN that extracts
intra-slice information, and a 3D FCN that exploits inter-slice information.
The architectures of the 2D and 3D FCNs are automatically adapted to a medical
image dataset using a multiobjective evolutionary based algorithm that
minimizes both the segmentation error and number of parameters in the network.
The proposed 2D-3D FCN ensemble was tested on the task of prostate segmentation
on the image dataset from the PROMISE12 Grand Challenge. The resulting network
is ranked in the top 10 submissions, surpassing the performance of other
automatically-designed architectures while being considerably smaller in size.

combine an enhanced relic radiation density, acting at the level of background
cosmology, with new physical ingredients affecting the evolution of
cosmological perturbations. Several authors have pointed out the ability of
combined Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)
data to probe the background cosmological history independently of both CMB
maps and supernovae data. Using state-of-the-art assumptions on BBN, we confirm
that combined BAO, deuterium, and helium data are in tension with the SH0ES
measurements under the $\Lambda$CDM assumption at the 3.2$\sigma$ level, while
being in close agreement with the CMB value. We subsequently show that floating
the radiation density parameter $N_\mathrm{eff}$ only reduces the tension down
to the 2.6$\sigma$ level. This conclusion, totally independent of any CMB data,
shows that a high $N_\mathrm{eff}$ accounting for extra relics (either
free-streaming or self-interacting) does not provide an obvious solution to the
crisis, not even at the level of background cosmology. To circumvent this
strong bound, (i) the extra radiation has to be generated after BBN to avoid
helium bounds, and (ii) additional ingredients have to be invoked at the level
of perturbations to reconcile this extra radiation with CMB and LSS data.

We focus on two special types of atomic defects that scatter the surface and
bulk electronic bands. With enhanced SNR in PQPI, the energy dispersions are
clearly resolved along high symmetry directions. We discuss the
defect-dependent scattering of bulk bands with the non-symmorphic
symmetry-enforced selection rules. Furthermore, an energy shift of the surface
floating band is observed and a new branch of energy dispersion (q6) is
resolved. This PQPI method can be applied to other complex materials to explore
defect-dependent interactions in the future.

obtain a Hamiltonian that is free of poles at the LR, with complete

non-circular-orbit and higher-order-in-mass-ratio terms up to 3PN order. We
confirm the absence of the LR-divergence in such an EOB Hamiltonian via
plunging trajectories through the LR radius. Moreover, we compare the binding

with SMR-3PN information improves the modeling of binary systems with small

non-invertible) maps with a time-varying parameter subject to a parameter
shift. We show that each stable path has a unique associated solution (a local
pullback attractor) which stays near the path for all negative time. When the
parameter changes slowly, this local pullback attractor stays near the path for
all time, but if the parameter changes quickly, the local pullback attractor
may move away from the path in positive time; this is the phenomenon of
R-tipping. We demonstrate that forward basin stability is an insufficient
condition to prevent R-tipping in maps of any dimension but that forward
inflowing stability is sufficient. Furthermore, we show that R-tipping will
happen when there is a certain kind of forward basin instability, and we prove
precisely what happens to the local pullback attractor as the rate of the
parameter change approaches infinity. We then highlight the differences between
discrete- and continuous-time systems by showing that when a map is obtained by
discretizing a flow, the pullback attractors for the map and flow can have
dramatically different behavior; there may be R-tipping in one system but not

introduce a queueing model for batch mix and study its delay properties. Our
analysis shows that delay of a batch mix grows quickly as the batch size gets
close to the number of senders connected to the mix. We then propose a
randomized batch mixing strategy and show that it achieves much better delay

states and network structure update as a coupled stochastic dynamical process.
Most prior work on coevolving voter models has focused on linear update rules
with fixed and homogeneous rewiring and adopting probabilities. By contrast, in
our nonlinear version, the probability that a node rewires or adopts is a
function of how well it ""fits in"" within its neighborhood. To explore this
idea, we incorporate a parameter $\sigma$ that represents the fraction of
neighbors of an updating node that share its opinion state. In an update, with
probability $\sigma^q$ (for some nonlinearity parameter $q$), the updating node
rewires; with complementary probability $1-\sigma^q$, the updating node adopts
a new opinion state. We study this mechanism using three rewiring schemes:
after an updating node deletes a discordant edge, it then either (1)
""rewires-to-random"" by choosing a new neighbor in a random process; (2)
""rewires-to-same"" by choosing a new neighbor in a random process from nodes
that share its state; or (3) ""rewires-to-none"" by not rewiring at all (akin to
""unfriending"" on social media). We compare our nonlinear coevolving model to
several existing linear models, and we find in our model that initial network
topology plays a larger role in the dynamics and the choice of rewiring
mechanism plays a smaller role. A particularly interesting feature of our model
is that, under certain conditions, the opinion state that is held initially by
a minority of the nodes can effectively spread to almost every node in a
network if the minority nodes view themselves as the majority. In light of this
observation, we relate our results to recent work on the majority illusion in
social networks.

to stop thermal migration of Ga into the iron oxide layer. Though such
migration and successive formation of the orthorhombic GaFeO$_3$ was supposed
earlier to be a potential trigger of the nucleation of the isostructural

single crystalline uniform films of epsilon ferrite by pulsed laser deposition
is possible even on the MgO capped GaN. The structural properties of the 60\,nm
thick Fe$_2$O$_3$ layer on MgO / GaN were probed by electron and x-ray
diffraction, both suggesting that the growth of $\varepsilon$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is
preceded by formation of a thin layer of $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. The presence of
the magnetically hard epsilon ferrite was independently confirmed by
temperature dependent magnetometry measurements. The depth-resolved x-ray and
polarized neutron reflectometry reveal that the 10\,nm iron oxide layer at the
interface has a lower density and a higher magnetization than the main volume
of the $\varepsilon$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ film. The density and magnetic moment depth
profiles derived from fitting the reflectometry data are in a good agreement

deep neural networks, scaling the training process while maintaining high

enjoys near-linear speedup, but asynchrony causes gradient staleness - the main
difficulty in scaling stochastic gradient descent to large clusters. Momentum,
which is often used to accelerate convergence and escape local minima,
exacerbates the gradient staleness, thereby hindering convergence. We propose
DANA: a novel technique for asynchronous distributed SGD with momentum that
mitigates gradient staleness by computing the gradient on an estimated future
position of the model's parameters. Thereby, we show for the first time that
momentum can be fully incorporated in asynchronous training with almost no
ramifications to final accuracy. Our evaluation on the CIFAR and ImageNet
datasets shows that DANA outperforms existing methods, in both final accuracy
and convergence speed while scaling up to a total batch size of 16K on 64

These tumors are also known to rely on angiogenesis, i.e., the growth of local
microvasculature via chemical signaling produced by the tumor. Thus, several
clinical studies have been investigating antiangiogenic therapy for advanced
prostate cancer, either as monotherapy or combined with standard cytotoxic
protocols. However, the complex genetic alterations promoting prostate cancer
growth complicate the selection of the best chemotherapeutic approach for each
patient's tumor. Here, we present a mathematical model of prostate cancer
growth and chemotherapy that may enable physicians to test and design
personalized chemotherapeutic protocols in silico. We use the phase-field
method to describe tumor growth, which we assume to be driven by a generic
nutrient following reaction-diffusion dynamics. Tumor proliferation and
apoptosis (i.e., programmed cell death) can be parameterized with
experimentally-determined values. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is included as a term
downregulating tumor net proliferation, while antiangiogenic therapy is modeled
as a reduction in intratumoral nutrient supply. Another equation couples the
tumor phase field with the production of prostate-specific antigen, which is an
extensively used prostate cancer biomarker. We prove the well-posedness of our
model and we run a series of representative simulations using an isogeometric
method to explore untreated tumor growth as well as the effects of cytotoxic
chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy, both alone and combined. Our
simulations show that our model captures the growth morphologies of prostate
cancer as well as common outcomes of cytotoxic and antiangiogenic mono and

Such bulk-edge correspondence has enabled the creation of robust electronic,

Recently, the advent of non-Hermitian topological systems---wherein energy is
not conserved---has sparked considerable theoretical advances. In particular,
novel topological phases that can only exist in non-Hermitian systems have been
introduced. However, whether such phases can be experimentally observed, and
what their properties are, have remained open questions. Here, we identify and
observe a novel form of bulk-edge correspondence for a particular non-Hermitian
topological phase. We find that a change in the bulk non-Hermitian topological
invariant leads to a change of topological edge mode localisation together with
peculiar purely non-Hermitian properties. Using a quantum-to-classical analogy,
we create a mechanical metamaterial with non-reciprocal interactions, in which
we observe experimentally the predicted bulk-edge correspondence, demonstrating
its robustness. Our results open new avenues for the field of non-Hermitian

those methods using specialized CNN architectures for capturing motion, our

devices such that each can store a small number of qubits. We thereby consider
two models for the operation of such a network. The first is a continuous
model, in which entanglement between a subset of the nodes is produced
continuously in the background. This can in principle allows the rapid creation
of entanglement between more distant nodes using the already pre-generated
entanglement pairs in the network. The second is an on-demand model, where
entanglement production does not commence before a request is made. Our
objective is to find protocols, that minimise the latency of the network to
serve a request to create entanglement between two distant nodes in the
network. We propose three routing algorithms and analytically show that as
expected when there is only a single request in the network, then employing
them on the continuous model yields a lower latency than on the on-demand one.
We study the performance of the routing algorithms in a ring, grid, and
recursively generated network topologies. We also give an analytical upper
bound on the number of entanglement swap operations the nodes need to perform
for routing entangled links between a source and a destination yielding a lower
bound on the end to end fidelity of the shared entangled state. We proceed to
study the case of multiple concurrent requests and show that in some of the
scenarios the on-demand model can outperform the continuous one. Using
numerical simulations on ring and grid networks we also study the behaviour of
the latency of all the routing algorithms. We observe that the proposed routing
algorithms behave far better than the existing classical greedy routing
algorithm. The simulations also help to understand the advantages and
disadvantages of different types of continuous models for different types of

per-ray linear equation, called the ray flow equation, that relates 3D scene
flow to 4D light field gradients. The ray flow equation is invariant to 3D
scene structure and applicable to a general class of scenes, but is
under-constrained (3 unknowns per equation). Thus, additional constraints must
be imposed to recover motion. We develop two families of scene flow algorithms
by leveraging the structural similarity between ray flow and optical flow
equations: local 'Lucas-Kanade' ray flow and global 'Horn-Schunck' ray flow,
inspired by corresponding optical flow methods. We also develop a combined
local-global method by utilizing the correspondence structure in the light
fields. We demonstrate high precision 3D scene flow recovery for a wide range
of scenarios, including rotation and non-rigid motion. We analyze the
theoretical and practical performance limits of the proposed techniques via the
light field structure tensor, a 3x3 matrix that encodes the local structure of
light fields. We envision that the proposed analysis and algorithms will lead
to design of future light-field cameras that are optimized for motion sensing,
in addition to depth sensing.

networks, and because they are multidimensional, much more complex routing
schemes can be used to pass information forward through the network than what
can be used in traditional neural networks. This work treats capsules as
collections of neurons in a fully connected neural network, where sub-networks
connecting capsules are weighted according to the routing coefficients
determined by routing by agreement. An energy function is designed to reflect
this model, and it follows that capsule networks with dynamic routing can be
formulated as a product of expert neurons. By alternating between dynamic
routing, which acts to both find subnetworks within the overall network as well
as to mix the model distribution, and updating the parameters by the gradient
of the contrastive divergence, a bottom-up, unsupervised learning algorithm is
constructed for capsule networks with dynamic routing. The model and its
training algorithm are qualitatively tested in the generative sense, and is
able to produce realistic looking images from standard vision datasets.

problem which limits the automatic diagnosis in routine clinical practice.
Moreover, the CT scans collected from multiple manufacturers may affect the

intensity scales and machine noises. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised learning assisted pulmonary nodule detection framework based on
a 3D Feature Pyramid Network (3DFPN) to improve the sensitivity of nodule
detection by employing multi-scale features to increase the resolution of
nodules, as well as a parallel top-down path to transit the high-level semantic
features to complement low-level general features. Furthermore, a High
Sensitivity and Specificity (HS2) network is introduced to eliminate the false
positive nodule candidates by tracking the appearance changes in continuous CT
slices of each nodule candidate on Location History Images (LHI). In addition,
in order to improve the performance consistency of the proposed framework
across data captured by different CT scanners without using additional
annotations, an effective self-supervised learning schema is applied to learn
spatiotemporal features of CT scans from large-scale unlabeled data. The
performance and robustness of our method are evaluated on several publicly

excitations, and the role of charge orders that are present at high $H$, remain

reveal novel properties of the high-field ground state. Our results demonstrate
that, while the vortex phase diagram of underdoped cuprates is not very
sensitive to the details of the charge orders, quantum fluctuations and
disorder play a key role as $T\rightarrow 0$. The presence of stripes, on the

examples [Li et al, 2018]; however, while that strategy improves resolution, it
also leads to high-frequency artifacts as well as low-frequency distortions in
the reconstructions. Here, we present a new approach that learns separately how
to handle the two frequency bands, low and high; and also learns how to
synthesize these two bands into the full-band reconstructions. We show that
this ""learning to synthesize"" (LS) method yields phase reconstructions of high
spatial resolution and artifact-free; and it is also resilient to high-noise
conditions, e.g. in the case of very low photon flux. In addition to the
problem of quantitative phase retrieval, the LS method is applicable, in
principle, to any inverse problem where the forward operator treats different
frequency bands unevenly, i.e. is ill-posed.

Similar to previous analyses, we discuss all the simplest neutrino sectors

Unlike previous analyses, we allow right-handed charged leptons to transform as
all combinations of $\mathbf{1}$, $\mathbf{1}'$ and $\mathbf{1}''$

fourteen models for both NO and IO neutrino mass ordering can accommodate the

of next-item prediction. The procedure aims to give an answer to the question:
""Given the natural sequence of user-item interactions up to time t, can we
predict which item the user will interact with at time t+1?"". Evaluation
results obtained through said methodology are then used as a proxy to predict
which system will perform better in an online setting. The online setting,
however, poses a subtly different question: ""Given the natural sequence of
user-item interactions up to time t, can we get the user to interact with a

an intervention, and we want to measure its effect. Next-item prediction is
often used as a fall-back objective when information about interventions and
their effects (shown recommendations and whether they received a click) is

trending news on the super large-scale online network of Sina Weibo (China's

extremely low exposure rate, even they are following tens of thousands of
others; and the re-exposure rate is substantially higher for news with more
transmission waves and stronger secondary forwarding. While exposure and

exceptional cases where it is possible to achieve a high exposure rate while
maintaining low re-exposure rate, or vice versa.

technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that may lead to
negative consequences, in particular, when ethical and safety procedures are
underestimated or even ignored. As a consequence, different actors are urging
to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological
advancements. As there is no easy access to data describing this AI race,
theoretical models are necessary to understand its dynamics, allowing for the
identification of when, how and which procedures need to be put in place to
favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks
and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which AI
supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this supremacy can be
achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions
are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring
regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that blindly imposing regulations may
not have anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises
between what individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar
observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from
the short term situation, certain conditions require the promotion of
risk-taking as opposed to compliance to safety regulations in order to improve
social welfare. These results remain robust when two or several actors are
involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are
produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and

Coming from high temperatures where the l= 0-term is dominant, near the
critical temperature Tinf{c}= 0 K, eigenvalues showing increasing l-values are
more and more selected. We derive an exact expression for the spin-spin

modeled by a Markov decision process. In this problem, the agents operate in a
common environment under a fixed control policy, working together to discover
the value (global discounted accumulative reward) associated with each
environmental state. Over a series of time steps, the agents act, get rewarded,
update their local estimate of the value function, then communicate with their
neighbors. The local update at each agent can be interpreted as a distributed
variant of the popular temporal difference learning methods {\sf TD}$
(\lambda)$.
  Our main contribution is to provide a finite-analysis on the performance of
this distributed {\sf TD}$(\lambda)$ algorithm for both constant and
time-varying step sizes. The key idea in our analysis is to use the geometric
mixing time $\tau$ of the underlying Markov chain, that is, although the
""noise"" in our algorithm is Markovian, its dependence is very weak at samples
spaced out at every $\tau$. We provide an explicit upper bound on the
convergence rate of the proposed method as a function of the network topology,
the discount factor, the constant $\lambda$, and the mixing time $\tau$.
  Our results also provide a mathematical explanation for observations that
have appeared previously in the literature about the choice of $\lambda$. Our
upper bound illustrates the trade-off between approximation accuracy and
convergence speed implicit in the choice of $\lambda$. When $\lambda=1$, the
solution will correspond to the best possible approximation of the value
function, while choosing $\lambda = 0$ leads to faster convergence when the
noise in the algorithm has large variance.

wavelength cutoff in the K-band is not just focused on a single or small number
of key science cases. Instead, it is extremely broad, answering key science
questions in nearly every branch of astronomy while also providing a dense and
accurate visible-NIR reference frame needed for future astronomy facilities.
For almost 2 billion common stars the combination of Gaia and a new all-sky NIR
astrometry mission would provide much improved proper motions, answering key
science questions -- from the solar system and stellar systems, including
exoplanet systems, to compact galaxies, quasars, neutron stars, binaries and
dark matter substructures. The addition of NIR will result in up to 8 billion
newly measured stars in some of the most obscured parts of our Galaxy, and
crucially reveal the very heart of the Galactic bulge region. In this white
paper we argue that rather than improving on the accuracy, a greater overall
science return can be achieved by going deeper than Gaia and by expanding the
wavelength range to the NIR.

surface granulation is essential for improving theories of mode physics and the
properties of the outer convection zone of solar-like stars. A proper
prediction of these amplitudes is also essential for appraising the
detectability of solar-like oscillations for asteroseismic analysis.
Comparisons with models, or between different photometric missions, are enabled
by applying a bolometric correction, which converts mission-specific amplitudes
to their corresponding bolometric (full light) values. We derive the bolometric
correction factor for amplitudes of radial oscillation modes and surface
granulation as observed by the Kepler, CoRoT, and TESS missions. The
calculations are done assuming a stellar spectrum given by a black-body as well
as by synthetic spectral flux densities from 1D model atmospheres. We derive a
power-law and polynomial relations for the bolometric correction as a function
of temperature from the black-body approximation and evaluate the deviations
from adopting a more realistic spectrum. Across the full temperature range from
4000 - 7500 K, the amplitudes from TESS are in the black-body approximation
predicted to be a factor ~0.83 - 0.84 times those observed by Kepler. We find
that using more realistic flux spectra over the black-body approximation can
change the bolometric correction by as much as ~30% at the lowest temperatures,
but with a change typically within ~5 - 10% around a $T_{\rm eff}$ of 5500 -
6000 K. We find that after $T_{\rm eff}$, the bolometric correction most
strongly depends on [M/H], which could have an impact on reported metallicity
dependencies of amplitudes reported in the literature.

integrates universal physical laws with data-driven models of experimental data
for scientific computing. A new data-driven simulation approach coupled with a
locally convex reconstruction, termed the local convexity data-driven (LCDD)
computing, is proposed to enhance accuracy and robustness against noise and
outliers in data sets in the data-driven computing. In this approach, for a
given state obtained by the physical simulation, the corresponding optimum
experimental solution is sought by projecting the state onto the associated
local convex manifold reconstructed based on the nearest experimental data.
This learning process of local data structure is less sensitive to noisy data
and consequently yields better accuracy. A penalty relaxation is also
introduced to recast the local learning solver in the context of non-negative
least squares that can be solved effectively. The reproducing kernel
approximation with stabilized nodal integration is employed for the solution of
the physical manifold to allow reduced stress-strain data at the discrete
points for enhanced effectiveness in the LCDD learning solver. Due to the
inherent manifold learning properties, LCDD performs well for high-dimensional
data sets that are relatively sparse in real-world engineering applications.
Numerical tests demonstrated that LCDD enhances nearly one order of accuracy
compared to the standard distance-minimization data-driven scheme when dealing
with noisy database, and a linear exactness is achieved when local
stress-strain relation is linear.

learning systems pose challenges for engineers and users. Their inherent
complexity makes it impossible to easily judge their fairness and the
correctness of statistically learned relations between variables and classes.
Explainable AI aims to solve this challenge by modelling explanations alongside
with the classifiers, potentially improving user trust and acceptance. However,
users should not be fooled by persuasive, yet untruthful explanations. We
therefore conduct a user study in which we investigate the effects of model
accuracy and explanation fidelity, i.e. how truthfully the explanation
represents the underlying model, on user trust. Our findings show that accuracy
is more important for user trust than explainability. Adding an explanation for
a classification result can potentially harm trust, e.g. when adding
nonsensical explanations. We also found that users cannot be tricked by
high-fidelity explanations into having trust for a bad classifier. Furthermore,
we found a mismatch between observed (implicit) and self-reported (explicit)

recognition approach which concurrently learns both the object categories and
the local features for encoding objects. In this work, each object is
represented using a set of general latent visual topics and category-specific
dictionaries. The general topics encode the common patterns of all categories,
while the category-specific dictionary describes the content of each category
in details. The proposed approach discovers both sets of general and specific
representations in an unsupervised fashion and updates them incrementally using
new object views. Experimental results show that our approach yields
significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art approaches
concerning scalability and object classification performance. Moreover, our
approach demonstrates the capability of learning from very few training
examples in a real-world setting. Regarding computation time, the best result

characterized by a small number of training images and non-local patterns that

learning (MIL) to design an instance label generator under this weakly

bags of varying sizes, we propose to repurpose an MIL model originally trained
for bag-level classification to produce reliable predictions for single
instances, i.e., bags of size $1$. To this end, we introduce a novel
regularization strategy based on virtual adversarial training for improving MIL
training, and subsequently develop a knowledge distillation technique for
repurposing the trained MIL model. Using empirical studies on colon cancer and
breast cancer detection from histopathological images, we show that the
proposed approach produces high-quality instance-level prediction and
significantly outperforms state-of-the MIL methods.

address the problem of limb-pose estimation under a different point of view. We
proposed a 2D fully-convolutional neural network for roughly detecting limb
joints and joint connections, followed by a regression convolutional neural
network for accurate joint and joint-connection position estimation. Joints
from the same limb are then connected with a maximum bipartite matching
approach. Our analysis does not require any prior modeling of infants' body
