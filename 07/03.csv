parabolic reaction-diffusion equations in which the diffusion is regulated by a
fractional Laplace operator of order $2 s \in (0, 2)$ acting in one space
dimension and the reaction is determined by a $1$-periodic multi-well
potential. We construct solutions of these equations that represent the typical
propagation of $N \ge 2$ equally oriented dislocations of size $1$. For large
times, the dislocations occur around points that evolve according to a
repulsive dynamical system. When $s \in (1/2, 1)$, these solutions are shown to
be asymptotically stable with respect to odd perturbations.

computational tasks, and arguably the most promising application area for
near-term quantum computers is the simulation of quantum mechanics. To make the
most of our limited quantum computing resources, we need new and more compact
algorithms and mappings. Whereas previous work, including recent
demonstrations, has focused primarily on general mappings for fermionic
systems, we propose instead to construct customized mappings tailored to the
considered quantum mechanical systems. Specifically, we take advantage of
existing symmetry, which we build into the mappings a priori to obtain optimal
compactness. To demonstrate this approach, we have performed quantum computing
calculations of the fluorine molecule, in which we have mapped 16 active
spin-orbitals to 4 qubits. This is a four-fold reduction in the qubit
requirement, as compared to the standard general mappings. Moreover, our
compact system-to-qubits mappings are robust against noise that breaks
symmetry, thereby reducing non-statistical errors in the computations.
Furthermore, many systems, including F2, are described by real Hamiltonians,
allowing us to also reduce the number of single-qubit operations in the
hardware-efficient ansatz for the quantum variational eigensolver by roughly a
factor of three.

two types of relic particles, possibly interacting with each other:
non-relativistic DM, and relativistic Dark Radiation (DR). These models have
interesting consequences for cosmological observables, and could in principle
solve problems like the small-scale cold DM crisis, Hubble tension, and/or low
$\sigma_8$ value. Their cosmological behaviour is captured by the ETHOS
parametrisation, which includes a DR-DM scattering rate scaling like a
power-law of the temperature, $T^n$. Scenarios with $n=0$, $2$, or $4$ can
easily be realised in concrete dark sector set-ups. Here we update constraints
on these three scenarios using recent CMB, BAO, and high-resolution
Lyman-$\alpha$ data. We introduce a new Lyman-$\alpha$ likelihood that is
applicable to a wide range of cosmological models with a suppression of the
matter power spectrum on small scales. For $n=2$ and $4$, we find that
Lyman-$\alpha$ data strengthen the CMB+BAO bounds on the DM-DR interaction rate
by many orders of magnitude. However, models offering a possible solution to
the missing satellite problem are still compatible with our new bounds. For
$n=0$, high-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data bring no stronger constraints on the
interaction rate than CMB+BAO data, except for extremely small values of the DR
density. Using CMB+BAO data and a theory-motivated prior on the minimal density
of DR, we find that the $n=0$ model can reduce the Hubble tension from
$4.1\sigma$ to $2.7\sigma$, while simultaneously accommodating smaller values
of the $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ parameters hinted by cosmic shear data.

graphical structure.
  We establish that at any boundary points at which the trace from inside
happens to coincide with the exterior datum, also the tangent planes of the
traces necessarily coincide with those of the exterior datum.
  This very rigid geometric constraint is in sharp contrast with the case of
the solutions of the linear equations driven by the fractional Laplacian, since
we also show that, in this case, the fractional normal derivative can be
prescribed arbitrarily, up to a small error.
  We remark that, at a formal level, the linearization of the trace of a
nonlocal minimal graph is given by the fractional normal derivative of a
fractional Laplace problem, therefore the two problems are formally related.
Nevertheless, the nonlinear equations of fractional mean curvature type present
very specific properties which are strikingly different from those of other
problems of fractional type which are apparently similar, but diverse in
structure, and the nonlinear case given by the nonlocal minimal graphs turns
out to be significantly more rigid than its linear counterpart.

  triviality",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we focus on the two-dimensional anisotropic KPZ (aKPZ) equation,
which is formally given by \begin{equation*}\partial_t h =\frac{\nu}{2}\Delta h
+ \lambda((\partial_1 h)^2 - (\partial_2 h)^2) +
\nu^\frac{1}{2}\xi,\end{equation*} where $\xi$ denotes a noise which is white
in both space and time, and $\lambda$ and $\nu$ are positive constants. Due to
the wild oscillations of the noise and the quadratic nonlinearity, the previous
equation is classically ill-posed. It is not possible to linearise it via the
Cole-Hopf transformation and the pathwise techniques for singular SPDEs (the
theory of Regularity Structures by M. Hairer or the paracontrolled
distributions approach of M. Gubinelli, P. Imkeller, N. Perkowski) are not
applicable. In the present work, we consider a regularised version of aKPZ
which preserves its invariant measure. We show that in order to have
subsequential limits once the regularisation is removed, it is necessary to
suitably renormalise $\lambda$ and $\nu$. Moreover, we prove that, in the
regime suggested by the (non-rigorous) renormalisation group computations of
[D.E. Wolf, ""Kinetic roughening of vicinal surfaces'', Phys. Rev. Lett., 1991],
i.e. $\nu$ constant and the coupling constant $\lambda$ converging to $0$ as
the inverse of the square root logarithm, any limit differs from the solution
to the linear equation obtained by simply dropping the nonlinearity in aKPZ.

searching method to find a safe, kinodynamic feasible and minimum-time initial

clearance of the trajectory by a B-spline optimization, which incorporates
gradient information from a Euclidean distance field (EDF) and dynamic
constraints efficiently utilizing the convex hull property of B-spline.
Finally, by representing the final trajectory as a non-uniform B-spline, an
iterative time adjustment method is adopted to guarantee dynamically feasible
and non-conservative trajectories. We validate our proposed method in various
complex simulational environments. The competence of the method is also
validated in challenging real-world tasks. We release our code as an

  downwind direction?",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measuring the directional distribution of ocean waves is a difficult task in
ocean wave research. For many decades, wind-generated waves are assumed to
propagate primarily in the wind direction. The concept is applied either
implicitly or explicitly in the formulation of the wind input function and the
design of the wave directional distribution function. Photographs of the ocean
surface wave fields under steady wind forcing, however, display very different
directional properties. In the near shore region, the surface undulations are
dominantly crosswind. As the fetch increases, the geometry of surface waves is
crosshatched, indicating two dominant wave trains crossing each other. This
pattern of wave propagation in off-wind directions is repeatedly photographed
in different locations under different offshore (toward) wind events. The
wavelengths of these airborne photographs are in the deca-meter length scale.
Shorter waves with wavelengths ranging from a few centimeters to a few
decimeters also show crosshatched patterns, based on pictures taken from land
and ship. In the crosshatched cases, most pictures show that the wind vector
bisecting the diamond shape of the surface wave geometry. The observed wave
geometries and their fetch evolution expose a major flaw in our fundamental
assumption (implicitly or explicitly) that ""wind-generated waves propagate
primarily in the wind direction."" The assumption has been taken for granted for
many decades in applications including basic research of wave dynamics and the
design of directional wave spectral model for calculations of the ocean surface
roughness and the force, energy, and momentum of a wave field.

an upper branch of the quasiparticle exist. The lower branch corresponds to an
attractive polaron and spans from the regime of weak coupling where the
impurity acts as a small density perturbation of the surrounding medium to deep
bound states which involve many particles from the bath and extend as far as
the healing length. The upper branch corresponds to an excited state where due
to repulsion a low-density bubble forms around the impurity but might be
unstable against decay into many-body bound states. Interaction effects
strongly affect the quasiparticle properties of the polaron. In particular, in
the strongly correlated regime, the impurity features a vanishing quasiparticle
residue, signaling the transition from an almost free quasiparticle to a bound
state involving many atoms from the bath.

in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory using the hexagon formalism. We
concentrate on heavy-heavy-light correlators where the heavy operators are BMN
operators, with large R-charges and finite anomalous dimensions, and the light
one is a finite-charge chiral primary operator. They describe the couplings
between two highly boosted strings and a supergravity mode in the bulk dual. In
the hexagon framework, two sums over virtual magnons are needed to bind the
hexagons together around the light operator. We evaluate these sums explicitly
at strong coupling, for a certain choice of BMN operators, and show that they
factorise into a ratio of Gamma functions and a simple stringy prefactor. The
former originates from giant mirror magnons scanning the AdS geometry while the
latter stems from small fluctuations around the BMN vacuum. The resulting
structure constants have poles at positions where an enhanced mixing with
double-trace operators is expected and zeros whenever the process is forbidden
by supersymmetry. We also discuss the transition to the classical regime, when
the length of the light operator scales like the string tension, where we
observe similitudes with the Neumann coefficients of the pp-wave String Field
Theory vertex.

is that it contains as approximations some of the mostly used empirical formula
used in that field. Moreover, this equation is now successfully employed for
the investigation of sorption of contaminants in aqueous media. An important
extension of the BSf(t,n,{\alpha}) has been the introduction of variation of
the fractal time coefficient ({\alpha}(t^{\nu} )). This improvement can lead to
a greater precision of the fits and deduce some hint on the nature of the drug
release process which can give precious information to propose microscopic
molecular ad hoc models. We, therefore, suggest the use of the
BSf(t,n,{\alpha}(t^{\nu})) formula, as a first step, in any detailed
investigation and practical application of drug release data both in vitro and
in vivo studies starting with the Weibull and Hill approximations to follow
properly the physical solution.

programming formulation is exponential in the number of variables, but has a
low number of constraints, making it an interesting candidate for column
generation.
  In this paper, we devise and study two column generation strategies: a
natural one based on a simplified computation of reduced costs, and one through
a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. For the latter, we produce efficiently solvable
subproblems, namely, a pricing problem in the form of a classical
transportation problem. The two strategies begin with an efficient computation
of an initial feasible solution. While the structure of the constraints leads
to the computation of the reduced costs of all remaining variables for setup,
both approaches may outperform a computation using the full program in speed,
and dramatically so in memory requirement. In our computational experiments, we
exhibit that, depending on the input, either strategy can become a best choice.

the intergalactic medium and potentially host galaxies [2]. Although several
theories exist for the sources of these fast radio bursts, their intensities,
durations and temporal structures suggest coherent emission from highly
magnetised plasma [3,4]. Two sources have been observed to repeat [5,6], and
one repeater (FRB 121102) has been localised to the largest star-forming region
of a dwarf galaxy at a cosmological redshift of 0.19 [7, 8]. However, the host
galaxies and distances of the so far non-repeating fast radio bursts are yet to

interferometer with sufficient spatial resolution for arcsecond localisation at
the time of discovery. Here we report the localisation of a fast radio burst

polarization (HVP) using a dispersive representation of the $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$
amplitude. This channel gives the second-largest individual contribution to the
total HVP integral in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$,
both to its absolute value and uncertainty. It is largely dominated by the
narrow resonances $\omega$ and $\phi$, but not to the extent that the off-peak
regions were negligible, so that at the level of accuracy relevant for
$(g-2)_\mu$ an analysis of the available data as model independent as possible
becomes critical. Here, we provide such an analysis based on a global fit
function using analyticity and unitarity of the underlying $\gamma^*\to3\pi$
amplitude and its normalization from a chiral low-energy theorem, which, in
particular, allows us to check the internal consistency of the various
$e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data sets. Overall, we obtain $a_\mu^{3\pi}|_{\leq
1.8\,\text{GeV}}=46.2(6)(6)\times 10^{-10}$ as our best estimate for the total
$3\pi$ contribution consistent with all (low-energy) constraints from QCD. In
combination with a recent dispersive analysis imposing the same constraints on
the $2\pi$ channel below $1\,\text{GeV}$, this covers nearly $80\%$ of the
total HVP contribution, leading to $a_\mu^\text{HVP}=692.3(3.3)\times 10^{-10}$
when the remainder is taken from the literature, and thus reaffirming the
$(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly at the level of at least $3.4\sigma$. As side products, we
find for the vacuum-polarization-subtracted masses
$M_\omega=782.63(3)(1)\,\text{MeV}$ and $M_\phi=1019.20(2)(1)\,\text{MeV}$,
confirming the tension to the $\omega$ mass as extracted from the $2\pi$

both binary neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae. We focus on
the abundances of (extremely) metal-poor stars, most of which were formed
during the first ~Gyr of the Universe in external galaxies and later accreted
onto the main galaxy. We find that the majority of metal-poor stars are
r-process enriched in all our enrichment models. Neutron star merger models
result in a median r-process abundance ratio which increases with metallicity,
whereas the median trend in rare core-collapse supernova models is
approximately flat. The scatter in r-process abundance increases for models
with longer delay times or lower rates of r-process producing events. Our
results are nearly perfectly converged, in part due to the mixing of gas
between mesh cells in the simulations. Additionally, different Milky Way-mass
galaxies show only small variation in their respective r-process abundance
ratios. Current (sparse and potentially biased) observations of metal-poor
stars in the Milky Way seem to prefer rare core-collapse supernovae over
neutron star mergers as the dominant source of r-process elements at low
metallicity, but we discuss possible caveats to our models. Dwarf galaxies
which experience a single r-process event early in their history show highly
enhanced r-process abundances at low metallicity, which is seen both in

More isolated UDGs are important for our understanding of UDG formation
scenarios because they form via secular mechanisms, allowing us to determine
the relative importance of environmentally-driven formation in groups and
clusters. We have used the public Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) together with the
Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) to constrain the abundance
and properties of UDGs in the field, targeting sources with low surface
brightness (24.0$\leq$\bar{\mu}_{e,r}}$\leq$\26.5) and large apparent sizes
(3.0\arcsec$\leq$\bar{r}_{e,r}}$\leq$8.0\arcsec). Accounting for several
sources of interlopers in our selection based on canonical scaling relations,
and using an empirical UDG model based on measurements from the literature, we
show that a scenario in which cluster-like red sequence UDGs occupy a
significant number of field galaxies is unlikely, with most field UDGs being
significantly bluer and showing signs of localised star formation. An immediate
conclusion is that UDGs are much more efficiently quenched in high-density
environments. We estimate an upper-limit on the total field abundance of UDGs
of 8$\pm$3$\times10^{-3}$cMpc$^{-3}$ within our selection range. We also
compare the total field abundance of UDGs to a measurement of the abundance of
HI-rich UDGs from the literature, suggesting that they occupy at least
one-fifth of the overall UDG population. The mass formation efficiency of UDGs
implied by this upper-limit is similar to what is measured in groups and

leads to the different assembly histories of blue groups (group with a blue
central) and red groups (group with a red central). For blue groups, both the
central galaxy and the halo continue to grow their mass. For red groups, the
central galaxy has been quenched and its stellar mass remains about constant,
while its halo continues to grow by merging smaller halos. From this simple
scenario, we speculate about the driving properties that should strongly
correlate with the group halo mass. We then apply the machine learning
algorithm the Random Forest (RF) regressor to blue groups and red groups
separately in the semianalytical model L-GALAXIES to explore these nonlinear
multicorrelations and to verify the scenario as proposed above. Remarkably, the
results given by the RF regressor are fully consistent with the prediction from
our simple scenario and hence provide strong support for it. As a consequence,
the group halo mass can be more accurately determined from observable galaxy
properties by the RF regressor with a 50% reduction in error. A halo mass more
accurately determined in this way also enables more accurate investigations on
the galaxy-halo connection and other important related issues, including
galactic conformity and the effect of halo assembly bias on galaxy assembly.

galactic nucleus (AGN) is one of the key internal drivers. Both of them play
fundamental roles in regulating the formation and evolution of galaxies. We
explore the interrelationship between environment and AGN in SDSS. At a given
stellar mass, the specific star formation rate distribution of the AGN host
galaxies remains unchanged with over-density, with the peak of the distribution
around the Green Valley. We show that, at a given stellar mass, the AGN
fraction that has been commonly used in previous studies (defined as the number
of AGNs relative to all galaxies including passive and star forming ones) does
decrease with increasing over-density for satellites. This is largely due to
the fact that the fraction of passive galaxies strongly depends on environment.
In order to investigate the intrinsic correlation between AGN and environment,
especially under the assumption that AGN feedback is responsible for star
formation quenching, the AGN fraction should be defined as the number of AGNs
relative to the star-forming galaxies only. With the new definition, we find
little dependence of AGN fraction on over-density, central/satellite, and group
halo mass. There is only marginal evidence that AGN may prefer denser regions,
which is possibly due to more frequent interaction of galaxies or higher merger
rate in groups. Our results support the scenario that internal secular
evolution is the predominant mechanism of triggering AGN activity, while
external environment related processes only play a minor role.

physical interactions, and the concomitant necessity of propagation of an
entity (in this case, off-shell quanta - virtual gravitons) between two
non-relativistic test masses in unveiling the quantum nature of linearized
gravity through a laboratory experiment. At the outset, we will argue that
observing the quantum nature of a system is not limited to evidencing
$O\left(\hbar\right)$ corrections to a classical theory: it instead hinges upon
verifying tasks that a classical system cannot accomplish. We explain the
background concepts needed from quantum field theory and quantum information
theory to fully appreciate the previously proposed table-top experiments:
namely forces arising through the exchange of virtual (off-shell) quanta, as
well as Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) and entanglement
witnesses. We clarify the key assumption inherent in our evidencing experiment,
namely the locality of physical interactions, which is a generic feature of
interacting systems of quantum fields around us, and naturally incorporates
micro-causality in the description of our experiment. We also present the types
of states the matter field must inhabit, putting the experiment on firm
relativistic quantum field theoretic grounds. At the end we use a non-local
theory of gravity to illustrate how our mechanism may still be used to detect
the qualitatively quantum nature of a force when the scale of non-locality is
finite. We find that the scale of non-locality, including the entanglement

long-distance critical fluctuations are completely classical, allowing one to
define a `quantum correlation length' that remains finite at the transition

the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $g-2$. Currently there is a
discrepancy between theory and data for this observable which could potentially
be explained by Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. Here we investigate
the possible impact of missing Standard Model (SM) higher order corrections and
BSM physics on the proposed measurement of $\Delta \alpha_{\rm{had}}$. In
principle either could be indirectly fitted into $\Delta \alpha_{\rm{had}}$,
causing inconsistencies if used in a $g-2$ application. The literature suggests
a target of 10 ppm on the cross section for the theoretical accuracy. We assess
the validity of this target in detail using a variety of methods, finding that
a 1 ppm target is a more conservative estimate to ensure missing higher orders

an essential role in tumour progression. Occurring over many different temporal

degrading enzymes (MDEs) by the cancer cells that consequently degrade the
surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). This process is vital for creating
space in which the cancer cells can progress and it is driven by the activities
of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this paper, we consider the
key role of two MMPs by developing further the novel two-part multiscale model
introduced in [33] to better relate at micro-scale the two micro-scale
activities that were considered there, namely, the micro-dynamics concerning
the continuous rearrangement of the naturally oriented ECM fibres within the
bulk of the tumour and MDEs proteolytic micro-dynamics that take place in an
appropriate cell-scale neighbourhood of the tumour boundary. Focussing
primarily on the activities of the membrane-tethered MT1-MMP and the soluble
MMP-2 with the fibrous ECM phase, in this work we investigate the MT1-MMP/MMP-2
cascade and its overall effect on tumour progression. To that end, we will
propose a new multiscale modelling framework by considering the degradation of
the ECM fibres not only to take place at macro-scale in the bulk of the tumour
but also explicitly in the micro-scale neighbourhood of the tumour interface as
a consequence of the interactions with molecular fluxes of MDEs that exercise
their spatial dynamics at the invasive edge of the tumour.

parameters characterizing the idealized manifold in function of the real one.
This calibration is a purely conventional process and can generally be done in
several ways, leading to different fittings. In practice, however, all possible
fittings cannot be considered as representative of the real manifold.
Approximating the real metric of the universe by the FLRW metric would be
adequate only if both corresponding structures, defined by the space-time
interval, are equivalent on large scales. This requirement puts some
constraints on what would be a representative FLRW metric. We show that the way
how measurements on SNIa are interpreted to determine the evolution of the
scale factor implicitly define the calibration process, and that this one is
compatible with the aforementioned constraints. On a theoretical point of view,
this indicates that the as fitted FLRW metric would indeed be representative of
the real one. On a practical point of view, however, we show that a bias in the
measurements could invalidate this conclusion. The bias comes from the fact
that SNIa are not randomly distributed over space, but are probably mostly
located in regions were matter is largely present, i.e., in overdense regions.
We explain how this bias could account for the apparent accelerated expansion
of the universe, without needing to introduce the dark energy assumption. We
show in particular that this bias leads to an inadequate fitting of the FLRW
metric, resulting in the appearance of a new term in the evolution equation of
the related scale factor, being equivalent to the cosmological constant.

We propose a general
quantitative framework of polymer bending that includes both the weak and
strong bending regimes on the same footing, based on a single general physical
principle. As the bending deformation increases beyond a certain
(polymer-specific) point, the change in the convexity properties of the
effective bending energy of the polymer makes the harmonic deformation
energetically unfavorable: in this strong bending regime the energy of the
polymer varies linearly with the average bending angle as the system follows
the convex hull of the deformation energy function. For double-stranded DNA,
the effective bending deformation energy becomes non-convex for bends greater
than about 2 degrees per base-pair, equivalent to the curvature of a closed
circular loop of about 160 base pairs. A simple equation is derived for the
polymer loop energy that covers both the weak and strong bending regimes. The
theory shows quantitative agreement with recent DNA cyclization experiments on
short DNA fragments, while maintaining the expected agreement with experiment
in the weak bending regime. Counter-intuitively, cyclization probability
(j-factor) of very short DNA loops is predicted to increase with decreasing
loop length; the j-factor reaches its minimum for loops of 45 base pairs.
Atomistic simulations reveal that the attractive component of the short-range
Lennard-Jones interaction between the backbone atoms can explain the underlying
non-convexity of the DNA effective bending energy, leading to the linear
bending regime. Applicability of the theory to protein-DNA complexes, including
the nucleosome, is discussed.

structure and astrophysical information. Those (d,p) reactions may be viewed as
three-body reactions and described with Faddeev techniques.
  {\bf Purpose} Faddeev-AGS equations in momentum space have a long tradition
of utilizing separable interactions in order to arrive at sets of coupled
integral equations in one variable. However, it needs to be demonstrated that
observables calculated based on separable interactions agree exactly with those
based on nonseparable forces.
  {\bf Methods} Momentum space AGS equations are solved with separable and
nonseparable forces as coupled integral equations.
  {\bf Results} Deuteron-alpha scattering is calculated via momentum space AGS
equations using the CD-Bonn neutron-proton force and a Woods-Saxon type
neutron(proton)-$^4$He force, for which the Pauli-forbidden S-wave bound state
is projected out. Elastic as well as breakup observables are calculated and
compared to results in which the interactions in the two-body sub-systems are
represented by separable interactions derived in the Ernst-Shakin-Thaler (EST)
framework. {\bf Conclusions} We find that the calculations based on the
separable representation of the interactions and the original interactions give
results that are in excellent agreement. Specifically, integrated cross
sections and angular distributions for elastic scattering agree within
$\approx$ 1\%, which is well below typical experimental errors. In addition,
the five-fold differential cross sections corresponding to breakup of the

engineering the brain requires us to simultaneously record most neurons or if
multiple recordings from smaller subsets suffice. This is made even more
important by the development of novel techniques that allow recording from
selected subsets of neurons, e.g. using optical techniques. To get at this
question, we analyze a neural network, trained on the MNIST dataset, using only
partial recordings and characterize the dependency of the quality of our
reverse engineering on the number of simultaneously recorded ""neurons"". We find
that reverse engineering of the nonlinear neural network is meaningfully
possible if a sufficiently large number of neurons is simultaneously recorded
but that this number can be considerably smaller than the number of neurons.
Moreover, recording many times from small random subsets of neurons yields
surprisingly good performance. Application in neuroscience suggests to
approximate the I/O function of an actual neural system, we need to record from
a much larger number of neurons. The kind of scaling analysis we perform here
can, and arguably should be used to calibrate approaches that can dramatically
scale up the size of recorded data sets in neuroscience.

Chemistry, is a technology for determining the 3-D structure of macromolecules
from many noisy 2-D projections of instances of these macromolecules, whose
orientations and positions are unknown. The molecular structures are not rigid
objects, but flexible objects involved in dynamical processes. The different
conformations are exhibited by different instances of the macromolecule
observed in a cryo-EM experiment, each of which is recorded as a particle
image. The range of conformations and the conformation of each particle are not
known a priori; one of the great promises of cryo-EM is to map this
conformation space. Remarkable progress has been made in determining rigid
structures from homogeneous samples of molecules in spite of the unknown
orientation of each particle image and significant progress has been made in
recovering a few distinct states from mixtures of rather distinct
conformations, but more complex heterogeneous samples remain a major challenge.
We introduce the ``hyper-molecule'' framework for modeling structures across
different states of heterogeneous molecules, including continuums of states.
The key idea behind this framework is representing heterogeneous macromolecules
as high-dimensional objects, with the additional dimensions representing the
conformation space. This idea is then refined to model properties such as
localized heterogeneity. In addition, we introduce an algorithmic framework for
recovering such maps of heterogeneous objects from experimental data using a
Bayesian formulation of the problem and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms to address the computational challenges in recovering these high
dimensional hyper-molecules. We demonstrate these ideas in a prototype applied
to synthetic data.

  Course Recommendation System",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Collaborative filtering based algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNN), tend towards predicting a perpetuation of past observed behavior. In a
recommendation context, this can lead to an overly narrow set of suggestions
lacking in serendipity and inadvertently placing the user in what is known as a
""filter bubble."" In this paper, we grapple with the issue of the filter bubble
in the context of a course recommendation system in production at a public
university. Most universities in the United States encourage students to
explore developing interests while simultaneously advising them to adhere to
course taking norms which progress them towards graduation. These competing
objectives, and the stakes involved for students, make this context a
particularly meaningful one for investigating real-world recommendation
strategies. We introduce a novel modification to the skip-gram model applied to
nine years of historic course enrollment sequences to learn course vector
representations used to diversify recommendations based on similarity to a
student's specified favorite course. This model, which we call multifactor2vec,
is intended to improve the semantics of the primary token embedding by also
learning embeddings of potentially conflated factors of the token (e.g.,
instructor). Our offline testing found this model improved accuracy and recall
on our course similarity and analogy validation sets over a standard skip-gram.
Incorporating course catalog description text resulted in further improvements.
We compare the performance of these models to the system's existing RNN-based
recommendations with a user study of undergraduates (N = 70) rating six
characteristics of their course recommendations. Results of the user study show
a dramatic lack of novelty in RNN recommendations and depict the characteristic
trade-offs that make serendipity difficult to achieve.

discretisation, no guarantees have been provided. In this paper, we introduce
stationary velocity fields (SVFs) parameterised by divergence-conforming
B-splines in the context of image registration. We demonstrate that sparse
linear constraints on the parameters of such divergence-conforming B-Splines
SVFs lead to being exactly divergence-free at any point of the continuous

take advantage of modern solvers for constrained optimisation, symmetric
registration approaches, arbitrary image similarity and additional

insights on the improved accuracy error over previous methods. We evaluate the

  Then we return to the study of the original quaternionic analogue of Cauchy's
second order pole formula and its relation to the polarization of vacuum. We
find the decomposition of the space of quaternionic-valued functions into
irreducible components that include the spaces of doubly left and right regular

vacuum polarization diagram is achieved by subtracting the component
corresponding to the one-dimensional subrepresentation of the conformal group.
After the regularization, the vacuum polarization diagram is identified with a
certain second order differential operator which yields a quaternionic version
of Maxwell equations.
  Next, we introduce two types of quaternionic algebras consisting of spaces of
scalar-valued and quaternionic-valued functions. We emphasize that these

This uses techniques from our study of the vacuum polarization diagram. These
algebras are not associative, but we can define an infinite family of

problem is to preprocess $n$ strings of length $d$, to quickly answer queries
$q$ of the form: if there is a database string within edit distance $r$ of $q$,
return a database string within edit distance $cr$ of $q$. Previous approaches
to this problem either rely on very large (superconstant) approximation ratios

  In this work give a simple and easy-to-implement hash function that can
quickly answer queries for a wide range of parameters. Specifically, our
strategy can answer queries in time $\tilde{O}(d3^rn^{1/c})$. The best known
practical results require $c \gg r$ to achieve any correctness guarantee;
meanwhile, the best known theoretical results are very involved and difficult
to implement, and require query time at least $24^r$. Our results significantly
broaden the range of parameters for which we can achieve nontrivial bounds,

several software development practices. Several tools such as TravisCI,
CircleCI, and Hudson, that implement CI practices, are commonly adopted by
software engineers. However, the way that software engineers use these tools
could lead to what we call ""Continuous Integration Theater"", a situation in
which software engineers do not employ these tools effectively, leading to
unhealthy CI practices. Aims: The goal of this paper is to make sense of how
commonplace are these unhealthy continuous integration practices being employed
in practice. Method: By inspecting 1,270 open-source projects that use
TravisCI, the most used CI service, we quantitatively studied how common is to
use CI (1) with infrequent commits, (2) in a software project with poor test
coverage, (3) with builds that stay broken for long periods, and (4) with
builds that take too long to run. Results: We observed that 748 ($sim$60%)
projects face infrequent commits, which essentially makes the merging process
harder. Moreover, we were able to find code coverage information for 51
projects. The average code coverage was 78%, although Ruby projects have a
higher code coverage than Java projects (86% and 63%, respectively). However,
some projects with very small coverage ($sim$4%) were found. Still, we observed
that 85% of the studied projects have at least one broken build that take more
than four days to be fixed. Interestingly, very small projects (up to 1,000
lines of code) are the ones that take the longest to fix broken builds.
Finally, we noted that, for the majority of the studied projects, the build is
executed under the 10 minutes rule of thumb. Conclusions: Our results are
important to an increasing community of software engineers that employ CI
practices on daily basis but may not be aware of bad practices that are
eventually employed.

graphs that are $F$-saturated. A graph $G$ is called $F$-saturated if $G$ does
not contain a subgraph isomorphic to $F$, but the addition of any edge creates
a copy of $F$. We first resolve a fundamental question of minimizing the number
of cliques of size $r$ in a $K_s$-saturated graph for all sufficiently large
numbers of vertices, confirming a conjecture of Kritschgau, Methuku, Tait, and
Timmons. We also go further and prove a corresponding stability result. Next we
minimize the number of cycles of length $r$ in a $K_s$-saturated graph for all
sufficiently large numbers of vertices, and classify the extremal graphs for
most values of $r$, answering another question of Kritschgau, Methuku, Tait,
and Timmons for most $r$. We then move on to a central and longstanding
conjecture in graph saturation made by Tuza, which states that for every graph
$F$, the limit $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sat(n, F)}{n}$ exists, where
$\sat(n, F)$ denotes the minimum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $F$-saturated
graph. Pikhurko made progress in the negative direction by considering families
of graphs instead of a single graph, and proved that there exists a graph
family $\mathcal{F}$ of size $4$ for which $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
\frac{\sat(n, \mathcal{F})}{n}$ does not exist (for a family of graphs
$\mathcal{F}$, a graph $G$ is called $\mathcal{F}$-saturated if $G$ does not
contain a copy of any graph in $\mathcal{F}$, but the addition of any edge
creates a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$, and $\sat(n, \mathcal{F})$ is
defined similarly). We make the first improvement in 15 years by showing that
there exist infinitely many graph families of size $3$ where this limit does
not exist. Our construction also extends to the generalized saturation problem
when we minimize the number of fixed-size cliques.

hierarchical structure. The underlying layer of HCVAE uses Local Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (L-CVAE) to generate a music bar which is pre-specified
by the First and Last Notes (FLN). The upper layer of HCVAE uses Global
Variational Autoencoder(G-VAE) to analyze the latent vector sequence generated
by the L-CVAE encoder, to explore the musical relationship between the bars,
and to produce the song pieced together by multiple music bars generated by the
L-CVAE decoder, which makes the song both have musical structure and sense of
direction. At the same time, the HCVAE shares a part of itself with the HCGAN
to further improve the performance of the generated music. The MIDI-Sandwich is
validated on the Nottingham dataset and is able to generate a single-track
melody sequence (17x8 beats), which is superior to the length of most of the
generated models (8 to 32 beats). Meanwhile, by referring to the experimental
methods of many classical kinds of literature, the quality evaluation of the
generated music is performed. The above experiments prove the validity of the
model.

models in $d$-dimensions. It is well known that many such quantum systems can
be constructed out of lattice gauge models. For dimensionality higher than two,
there are generalizations going beyond gauge theories, which are called higher
gauge theories and rely on higher-order generalizations of groups. Our main
concern is a large class of $d$-dimensional quantum systems derived from
Abelian higher gauge theories. In this paper, we derive a general formula for
the bipartition entanglement entropy for this class of models, and from it we
extract both the area law and the sub-leading terms, which explicitly depend on
the topology of the entangling surface. We show that the entanglement entropy
$S_A$ in a sub-region $A$ is proportional to $\log(GSD_{\tilde{A}})$, where
\(GSD_{\tilde{A}}\) is the ground state degeneracy of a particular restriction
of the full model to \(A\). The quantity $GSD_{\tilde{A}}$ can be further
divided into a contribution that scales with the size of the boundary $\partial
A$ and a term which depends on the topology of $\partial A$. There is also a
topological contribution coming from $A$ itself, that may be non-zero when $A$
has a non-trivial homology. We present some examples and discuss how the
topology of $A$ affects the topological entropy. Our formalism allows us to do
most of the calculation for arbitrary dimension $d$. The result is in agreement
with entanglement calculations for known topological models.

NP-hard problems require deep theoretical understanding of the properties of
the low-energy eigenstates and long-time coherent dynamics in quantum spin

orthogonality resulting in a new type of structure in quantum spin glass. Its
eigen-spectrum is split into the alternating sequence of bands formed by
quantum states of two distinct types ($x$ and $z$). Those of $z$-type are
non-ergodic extended eigenstates (NEE) in the basis of $\{\sigma_z\}$ operators
that inherit the structure of the classical spin glass with exponentially long
decay times of Edwards Anderson order parameter at any finite value of
transverse field $B_{\perp}$. Those of $x$-type form narrow bands of NEEs that
conserve the integer-valued $x$-magnetization. Quantum evolution within a given
band of each type is described by a Hamiltonian that belongs to either the
ensemble of Preferred Basis Levi matrices ($z$-type) or Gaussian Orthogonal
ensemble ($x$-type). We characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics using fractal
dimension $D$ that depends on energy density (temperature) and plays a role of
thermodynamic potential: $D=0$ in MBL phase, $0<D<1$ in NEE phase,
$D\rightarrow 1$ in ergodic phase in infinite temperature limit. MBL states
coexist with NEEs in the same range of energies even at very large $B_{\perp}$.
Bands of NEE states can be used for new quantum search-like algorithms of
population transfer in the low-energy part of spin-configuration space.
Remarkably, the intermitted structure of the eigenspectrum emerges in quantum
version of a statistically featureless Random Energy Model and is expected to
exist in a class of paractically important NP-hard problems that unlike REM can

notoriously difficult, however. In continuation of Goodrich et al.'s early
efforts, explicitly espousing the goal of putting the MapReduce framework on
footing equal to that of long-established models such as the PRAM, we
investigate the obvious complexity question of how the computational power of
MapReduce algorithms compares to that of combinational Boolean circuits
commonly used for parallel computations. Relying on the standard MapReduce
model introduced by Karloff et al. a decade ago, we develop an intricate
simulation technique to show that any problem in NC (i.e., a problem solved by
a logspace-uniform family of Boolean circuits of polynomial size and a depth
polylogarithmic in the input size) can be solved by a MapReduce computation in
O(T(n)/ log n) rounds, where n is the input size and T(n) is the depth of the
witnessing circuit family. Thus, we are able to closely relate the standard,
uniform NC hierarchy modeling parallel computations to the deterministic
MapReduce hierarchy DMRC by proving that NC^(i+1) is contained in DMRC^i for
all natural i, including 0. Besides the theoretical significance, this result
that has important applied aspects as well. In particular, we show for all
problems in NC^1---many practically relevant ones such as integer
multiplication and division, the parity function, and recognizing balanced
strings of parentheses being among these---how to solve them in a constant

schemas. Output schemas model the graphs that would be obtained by running the
rules on the graph models of the input schema. We present two approaches: one
based on computing a canonical (critical) instance of the schema, and a novel
approach based on query rewriting. We provide theoretical, complexity and
evaluation results that show the superior efficiency of our rewriting approach.

small differences in their initial state. The analogous diagnostic in quantum
many-body systems is an exponential growth of out-of-time-ordered correlation
functions (OTOCs). These quantities can be computed for various models, but
their experimental study requires the ability to evolve quantum states backward
in time, similar to the canonical Loschmidt echo measurement. In some simple
systems, backward time evolution can be achieved by reversing the sign of the
Hamiltonian; however in most interacting many-body systems, this is not a
viable option. Here we propose a new family of protocols for OTOC measurement
that do not require backward time evolution. Instead, they rely on ordinary
time-ordered measurements performed in the thermofield double (TFD) state, an
entangled state formed between two identical copies of the system. We show
that, remarkably, in this situation the Lyapunov chaos exponent $\lambda_L$ can
be extracted from the measurement of an ordinary two-point correlation
function. As an unexpected bonus, we find that our proposed method yields the
so-called ""regularized"" OTOC -- a quantity that is believed to most directly
indicate quantum chaos. According to recent theoretical work, the TFD state can
be prepared as the ground state of two weakly coupled identical systems and is
therefore amenable to experimental study. We illustrate the utility of these
protocols on the example of the maximally chaotic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and
support our findings by extensive numerical simulations.

(electromyography, dynamometry, shear wave imaging) provides no general,
non-invasive method for online estimation of skeletal intramuscular states.
Ultrasound (US) allows non-invasive imaging of muscle, yet current
computational approaches have never achieved simultaneous extraction nor
generalisation of independently varying, active and passive states. We use deep
learning to investigate the generalizable content of 2D US muscle images.
Method: US data synchronized with electromyography of the calf muscles, with
measures of joint moment/angle were recorded from 32 healthy participants (7
female, ages: 27.5, 19-65). We extracted a region of interest of medial
gastrocnemius and soleus using our prior developed accurate segmentation
algorithm. From the segmented images, a deep convolutional neural network was
trained to predict three absolute, drift-free, components of the
neurobiomechanical state (activity, joint angle, joint moment) during
experimentally designed, simultaneous, independent variation of passive (joint
angle) and active (electromyography) inputs. Results: For all 32 held-out
participants (16-fold cross-validation) the ankle joint angle,
electromyography, and joint moment were estimated to accuracy 55+-8%, 57+-11%,
and 46+-9% respectively. Significance: With 2D US imaging, deep neural networks
can encode in generalizable form, the activity-length-tension state
relationship of muscle. Observation only, low power, 2D US imaging can provide
a new category of technology for non-invasive estimation of neural output,
length and tension in skeletal muscle. This proof of principle has value for
personalised muscle diagnosis in pain, injury, neurological conditions,
neuropathies, myopathies and ageing.

$Spin_{n+1}$. Determining the homotopy type of the space of such closed curves
or, more generally, of spaces of such curves with prescribed initial and final
jets appears to be a hard problem, which has been solved for $n=2$ but
otherwise remains open. This paper is a step towards solving the problem for
larger values of $n$. In the process, we prove a related conjecture of B.
Shapiro and M. Shapiro. We define the itinerary of a locally convex curve
$\Gamma:[0,1]\to Spin_{n+1}$ as a word $w$ in the alphabet of non-trivial
permutations. This word encodes the succession of non-open Bruhat cells of
$Spin_{n+1}$ pierced by $\Gamma$. We prove that, for each word $w$, the
subspace of curves of itinerary $w$ is an embedded contractible (topological)
submanifold of finite codimension, thus defining a stratification of the space
of curves. We show how to obtain explicit (topologically) transversal sections
for each of these submanifolds. We study both a space of curves with minimum
regularity hypotheses, where only topological transversality applies, and
spaces of sufficiently regular curves. In both cases we study the neighboring
relation between strata. This is an important step in the construction of CW
cell complexes mapped into the original space of curves by weak homotopy

underlying roots of the disorder and can lead to earlier diagnosis and more
targeted treatment. A promising approach to identify biomarkers is using Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), which can be used to analyze graph structured data,
i.e. brain networks constructed by fMRI. One way to interpret important
features is through looking at how the classification probability changes if
the features are occluded or replaced. The major limitation of this approach is
that replacing values may change the distribution of the data and lead to
serious errors. Therefore, we develop a 2-stage pipeline to eliminate the need
to replace features for reliable biomarker interpretation. Specifically, we
propose an inductive GNN to embed the graphs containing different properties of
task-fMRI for identifying ASD and then discover the brain regions/sub-graphs
used as evidence for the GNN classifier. We first show GNN can achieve high
accuracy in identifying ASD. Next, we calculate the feature importance scores
using GNN and compare the interpretation ability with Random Forest. Finally,
we run with different atlases and parameters, proving the robustness of the
proposed method. The detected biomarkers reveal their association with social
behaviors. We also show the potential of discovering new informative
biomarkers. Our pipeline can be generalized to other graph feature importance
interpretation problems.

energy is known to trigger sub-critical transition to turbulence in many shear

problem can be computationally prohibitive within the context of
high-dimensional fluid flows. In this work, we investigate the utility of
control-oriented reduced-order models to facilitate the design of feedback flow
control strategies that minimize the maximum transient energy growth. An output
projection onto proper orthogonal decomposition modes is used to faithfully
capture the system energy. Subsequently, a balanced truncation is performed to
reduce the state dimension, while preserving the system's input-output

context of a linearized channel flow with blowing and suction actuation at the

tractable through the use of the proposed control-oriented reduced-order

the timing of sex-specific life-history events, such as the age of sexual
maturity and end of female fertility, and each sex has a distinct fitness
tradeoff associated with the trait. We provide a formula for the fitness
landscape of the population and show a natural extension of the result to an
arbitrary number of heritable traits. Our method can be viewed as a dynamical
systems generalisation of the Price Equation to include two sexes{, age

grandmothering, whereby post-fertile females subsidize their daughter's
fertility by provisioning grandchildren. Grandmothering can drive a shift
towards higher sex ratios due to lengthening female post-fertile longevity,
leading to changes in fitness for both sexes. For males, increased longevity is
accompanied by a substantially longer fertile lifespan resulting in higher sex
ratios in the fertile ages. Our fitness landscapes show a net increase in
fitness for both males and females at longer lifespans, and as a result, we
find that grandmothering alone provides an evolutionary trajectory to higher
longevities.

to-date, MultiWOZ 2.0 has a few shortcomings. Firstly, there is substantial

negatively impact the performance of state-tracking models. Secondly, follow-up
work (Lee et al., 2019) has augmented the original dataset with user dialogue

minor modifications. In this work we tackle the aforementioned issues by
introducing MultiWOZ 2.1. To fix the noisy state annotations, we use
crowdsourced workers to re-annotate state and utterances based on the original
utterances in the dataset. This correction process results in changes to over
32% of state annotations across 40% of the dialogue turns. In addition, we fix
146 dialogue utterances by canonicalizing slot values in the utterances to the
values in the dataset ontology. To address the second problem, we combined the
contributions of the follow-up works into MultiWOZ 2.1. Hence, our dataset also
includes user dialogue acts as well as multiple slot descriptions per dialogue
state slot. We then benchmark a number of state-of-the-art dialogue state
tracking models on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset and show the joint state tracking
performance on the corrected state annotations. We are publicly releasing

stability properties than classical momentum in the convex stochastic setting.
In particular, no iterate averaging is needed for convergence. Interestingly,
our analysis also provides a novel interpretation of Nesterov's momentum as
stable gradient amplification and highlights a possible reason for its unstable

data generated from the simulations, we find that the inner density slopes of

reasonably well. We compare the density slopes of C-EAGLE clusters with those
derived by Newman et al. for 7 massive galaxy clusters in the local Universe.
We find that the asymptotic best-fit inner slopes of ""generalized"" NFW (gNFW)

However, the mean mass-weighted dark matter density slopes of the simulated

that the estimate of ${\gamma}_{\rm gNFW}$ is very sensitive to the constraints
from weak lensing measurements in the outer parts of the cluster and a bias can
lead to an underestimate of ${\gamma}_{\rm gNFW}$.

formation potential of molecular clouds (MCs). The three-dimensional (3D)
turbulent Mach number, $\mathcal{M}$, allows us to predict the rate of star
formation. However, determining Mach numbers in observations is challenging
because it requires accurate measurements of the velocity dispersion. Moreover,
observations are limited to two-dimensional (2D) projections of the MCs and
velocity information can usually only be obtained for the line-of-sight
component. Here we present a new method that allows us to estimate
$\mathcal{M}$ from the 2D column density, $\Sigma$, by analysing the fractal
dimension, $\mathcal{D}$. We do this by computing $\mathcal{D}$ for six
simulations, ranging between $1$ and $100$ in $\mathcal{M}$. From this data we
are able to construct an empirical relation, $\log\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{D}) =
\xi_1(\text{erfc}^{-1} [(\mathcal{D}-\mathcal{D}_{\text{min}})/\Omega] +
\xi_2),$ where $\text{erfc}^{-1}$ is the inverse complimentary error function,
$\mathcal{D}_{\text{min}} = 1.55 \pm 0.13$ is the minimum fractal dimension of
$\Sigma$, $\Omega = 0.22 \pm 0.07$, $\xi_1 = 0.9 \pm 0.1$ and $\xi_2 = 0.2 \pm
0.2$. We test the accuracy of this new relation on column density maps from
$Herschel$ observations of two quiescent subregions in the Polaris Flare MC,
`saxophone' and `quiet'. We measure $\mathcal{M} \sim 10$ and $\mathcal{M} \sim
2$ for the subregions, respectively, which is similar to previous estimates
based on measuring the velocity dispersion from molecular line data. These
results show that this new empirical relation can provide useful estimates of
the cloud kinematics, solely based upon the geometry from the column density of
the cloud.

process these signals using digital hardware, they must be first sampled and
quantized using an analog-to-digital convertor (ADC), which typically operates
in a serial scalar manner. In this work, we propose a method for serial
quantization of sparse time sequences (SQuaTS) inspired by group testing
theory, which is designed to reliably and accurately quantize sparse signals
acquired in a sequential manner using serial scalar ADCs. Unlike previously
proposed approaches which combine quantization and compressed sensing (CS), our
SQuaTS scheme updates its representation on each incoming analog sample and
does not require the complete signal to be observed and stored in analog prior
to quantization. We characterize the asymptotic tradeoff between accuracy and
quantization rate of SQuaTS as well as its computational burden. We also
propose a variation of SQuaTS, which trades rate for computational efficiency.
Next, we show how SQuaTS can be naturally extended to distributed quantization
scenarios, where a set of jointly sparse time sequences are acquired
individually and processed jointly. Our numerical results demonstrate that
SQuaTS is capable of achieving substantially improved representation accuracy
over previous CS-based schemes without requiring the complete set of analog
signal samples to be observed prior to its quantization, making it an
attractive approach for acquiring sparse time sequences.

that the probability of heads is X0 in [0,1], and an adversary can reset one
processor to change the distribution of the final outcome. For X0=1/2, in the
non-cryptographic setting, Blum's majority protocol is $\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi n}}$
insecure. For computationally bounded adversaries and any X0 in [0,1], the
protocol of Moran,Naor,Segev (2009) is only O(1/n) insecure. In this paper, we
study discrete-time martingales (X0,X1,..,Xn) such that Xi in [0,1], for all i
in {0,..,n}, and Xn in {0,1}. In particular, for any X0 in [0,1], we construct
martingales that yield $\frac12\sqrt{\frac{X_0(1-X_0)}{n}}$ insecure
coin-tossing protocols with n-bit communication; irrespective of the number of
bits required to represent the output distribution. Note that for sufficiently
small X0, we achieve higher security than Moran et al's protocol even against
computationally unbounded adversaries. For X0=1/2, our protocol requires only
40% of the processors to obtain the same security as the majority protocol. We
introduce a new inductive technique that uses geometric transformations to
estimate the large gaps in these martingales. For any X0 in [0,1], we show that
there exists a stopping time $T$ such that
$\mathbb{E}[|{X_T-X_{T-1}}|]\geq\frac2{\sqrt{2n-1}}\cdot X_0(1-X_0)$. The
inductive technique also constructs martingales that demonstrate the optimality
of our bound - we construct optimal martingales such that any $T$
has$\mathbb{E}[|{X_T-X_{T-1}}|]\leq\frac1{\sqrt{n}}\cdot\sqrt{X_0(1-X_0)}$. Our
lower-bound holds for all X0 in [0,1]; while the previous bound of
Cleve,Impagliazzo (1993) exists only for positive constant X0. Our approach
only employs elementary techniques and avoids the complex probabilistic tools
inherent to the approaches of Cleve,Impagliazzo (1993) and

learning-based anomaly detection algorithms have been proposed, which can
usually achieve better detection results than traditional methods. In view of
reconstruct ability of the model and the calculation of anomaly score, this
paper proposes a time series anomaly detection method based on Variational
AutoEncoder model(VAE) with re-Encoder and Latent Constraint network(VELC). In
order to modify reconstruct ability of the model to prevent it from
reconstructing abnormal samples well, we add a constraint network in the latent
space of the VAE to force it generate new latent variables that are similar
with that of training samples. To be able to calculate anomaly score in two
feature spaces, we train a re-encoder to transform the generated data to a new
latent space. For better handling the time series, we use the LSTM as the
encoder and decoder part of the VAE framework. Experimental results of several
benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection
methods.

measurements when only magnitude information is available and we control the
input. We are motivated by the recent development of dedicated optics-based
hardware for rapid random projections which leverages the propagation of light
in random media. A signal of interest $\mathbf{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is mixed
by a random scattering medium to compute the projection $\mathbf{y} =
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{\xi}$, with $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{C}^{M \times N}$ being a
realization of a standard complex Gaussian iid random matrix. Such optics-based
matrix multiplications can be much faster and energy-efficient than their CPU
or GPU counterparts, yet two difficulties must be resolved: only the intensity
${|\mathbf{y}|}^2$ can be recorded by the camera, and the transmission matrix
$\mathbf{A}$ is unknown. We show that even without knowing $\mathbf{A}$, we can
recover the unknown phase of $\mathbf{y}$ for some equivalent transmission
matrix with the same distribution as $\mathbf{A}$. Our method is based on two
observations: first, conjugating or changing the phase of any row of
$\mathbf{A}$ does not change its distribution; and second, since we control the
input we can interfere $\mathbf{\xi}$ with arbitrary reference signals. We show
how to leverage these observations to cast the measurement phase retrieval
problem as a Euclidean distance geometry problem. We demonstrate appealing
properties of the proposed algorithm in both numerical simulations and real
hardware experiments. Not only does our algorithm accurately recover the
missing phase, but it mitigates the effects of quantization and the sensitivity
threshold, thus improving the measured magnitudes.

IMEX finite volume schemes for the compressible Euler equations in the zero
Mach number limit is presented. In order to account for the fast and slow
waves, the nonlinear fluxes in the Euler equations are split into stiff and
non-stiff components, respectively. The time discretisation is performed by an
IMEX Runge-Kutta method, therein the stiff terms are treated implicitly and the
non-stiff terms explicitly. In the space discretisation, a Rusanov-type central
flux is used for the non-stiff part, and simple central differencing for the
stiff part. Both the time semi-discrete and space-time fully-discrete schemes
are shown to be asymptotic preserving. The numerical experiments confirm that
the schemes achieve uniform second order convergence with respect to the Mach
number. A notion of accuracy at low Mach numbers, termed as the asymptotic
accuracy, is introduced in terms of the invariance of a well-prepared space of
constant densities and divergence-free velocities. The asymptotic accuracy is
concerned with the closeness of the compressible solution with that of its
incompressible counterpart in a low Mach number regime. It is shown
theoretically as well as numerically that the proposed schemes are
asymptotically accurate.

This compact representation is utilized by the reconstruction network to
generate a reconstructed image of the original one. In order to improve the

behaviour, and a probability model of the driver was proposed. First, the
question of whether the database is large enough is resolved using kernel
density estimation and Kullback-Liebler divergence. Next, the convergence
database is utilised to achieve the bivariate acceleration distribution
pattern. Subsequently, two probability models are proposed to explain the
pattern. Finally, the statistical characteristics of the acceleration
behaviours are studied to verify the probability models. The longitudinal and
lateral acceleration behaviours always approximate a similar Pareto
distribution. The braking, accelerating, and steering manoeuvres become more
intense at first and then less intense as the velocity increases. These
behaviours characteristics reveal the mechanism of the quadrangle bivariate
acceleration distribution pattern. The bivariate acceleration behaviour of the
driver will never reach a circle-shaped pattern. The bivariate Pareto
distribution model can be applied to describe the bivariate acceleration
behaviour of the driver.

the weak interacting regime based on the Slater mechanism of Fermi surface
nesting. As $U$ passes a crossover value $U^*/t\approx 9$, the single-particle
gap scales linearly with $U$, marking the onset of Mott physics. In the Mott
regime, antiferromagnetism becomes to be suppressed as $U$ increases, and
vanishes after $U$ passes the critical value $U_{\rm AF,c}/t=13.3\pm 0.05$. The
critical exponents are obtained via critical scalings as $\nu_{\rm AF}=0.60\pm

Routing CapsuleNet (AR CapsNet). We replace the dynamic routing and squash
activation function of the capsule network with dynamic routing (CapsuleNet)
with the attention routing and capsule activation. The attention routing is a
routing between capsules through an attention module. The attention routing is
a fast forward-pass while keeping spatial information. On the other hand, the
intuitive interpretation of the dynamic routing is finding a centroid of the
prediction capsules. Thus, the squash activation function and its variant focus
on preserving a vector orientation. However, the capsule activation focuses on
performing a capsule-scale activation function.
  We evaluate our proposed model on the MNIST, affNIST, and CIFAR-10
classification tasks. The proposed model achieves higher accuracy with fewer
parameters (x0.65 in the MNIST, x0.82 in the CIFAR-10) and less training time
than CapsuleNet (x0.19 in the MNIST, x0.35 in the CIFAR-10). These results
validate that designing a capsule-scale operation is a key factor to implement
the capsule concept.
  Also, our experiment shows that our proposed model is transformation
equivariant as CapsuleNet. As we perturb each element of the output capsule,
the decoder attached to the output capsules shows global variations. Further
experiments show that the difference in the capsule features caused by applying
affine transformations on an input image is significantly aligned in one
direction.

its electrical transport properties up to 12.5 GPa by using a cubic anvil cell
apparatus. We find that TN determined from the resistivity anomaly first
increases slightly with pressure and then decreases until vanished completely
at ~7 GPa. Intriguingly, its resistivity rho(T) is enhanced gradually by
pressure, and evolves from metallic to activated behavior as the AF order is
suppressed. From the Hall resistivity measurements, we confirm that the n-type
carriers dominate the transport properties and the carrier density is raised by
pressure. In addition, the critical magnetic field Hc1 ~3.3 T at 0 GPa for the
spin-flop transition to the canted AF state is found to increase to ~ 5 T and
7.5 T at 1 and 3 GPa. High-pressure XRD evidenced no structural transition up

mode frequency on the dimensionless effective range of the interaction,

agents with additive utilities, when money transfers are not allowed. The
competitive rule is known to be the best mechanism for goods with additive
utilities and was recently extended to chores by Bogomolnaia et al (2017). For
both goods and chores, the rule produces Pareto optimal and envy-free
allocations. In the case of goods, the outcome of the competitive rule can be
easily computed. Competitive allocations solve the Eisenberg-Gale convex
program; hence the outcome is unique and can be approximately found by standard
gradient methods. An exact algorithm that runs in polynomial time in the number
of agents and goods was given by Orlin.
  In the case of chores, the competitive rule does not solve any convex
optimization problem; instead, competitive allocations correspond to local
minima, local maxima, and saddle points of the Nash Social Welfare on the
Pareto frontier of the set of feasible utilities. The rule becomes multivalued
and none of the standard methods can be applied to compute its outcome.
  In this paper, we show that all the outcomes of the competitive rule for
chores can be computed in strongly polynomial time if either the number of
agents or the number of chores is fixed. The approach is based on a combination
of three ideas: all consumption graphs of Pareto optimal allocations can be
listed in polynomial time; for a given consumption graph, a candidate for a
competitive allocation can be constructed via explicit formula; and a given
allocation can be checked for being competitive using a maximum flow
computation as in Devanur et al (2002).
  Our algorithm immediately gives an approximately-fair allocation of

continuation of the pion vector form factor from other kinematical regions. In
this work we compare the results of the analytic continuation with direct

the sensitivity of the method to the timelike data on the modulus of the form
factor used as input, by extending the input region to energies up to 0.76 GeV.

robust quantitative generalization of Segala and Lynch's probabilistic
bisimilarity for probabilistic automata. In this paper, we present a
characterization of the bisimilarity distance as the solution of a simple
stochastic game. The characterization gives us an algorithm to compute the
distances by applying Condon's simple policy iteration on these games. The
correctness of Condon's approach, however, relies on the assumption that the
games are stopping. Our games may be non-stopping in general, yet we are able
to prove termination for this extended class of games. Already other algorithms
have been proposed in the literature to compute these distances, with
complexity in $\textbf{UP} \cap \textbf{coUP}$ and \textbf{PPAD}. Despite the
theoretical relevance, these algorithms are inefficient in practice. To the
best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first practical solution.
  The characterization of the probabilistic bisimilarity distance mentioned
above crucially uses a dual presentation of the Hausdorff distance due to
M\'emoli. As an additional contribution, in this paper we show that M\'emoli's
result can be used also to prove that the bisimilarity distance bounds the
difference in the maximal (or minimal) probability of two states to satisfying
arbitrary $\omega$-regular properties, expressed, eg., as LTL formulas.

step (BFS). The BFS flow at Reynolds number $Re=500$ (defined with the step
height and the maximum inlet velocity) is two-dimensional and linearly stable
but increasingly receptive to disturbances, with a potential for amplification
as the recirculation length increases. We compute optimal spanwise-periodic
control (steady wall blowing/suction or wall deformation) for decreasing the
recirculation length, based on a second-order sensitivity analysis. Results
show that wall-normal velocity control is always more efficient than
wall-tangential control. The most efficient spanwise wavelength for the optimal
control depends on the location: $\beta=0.6$ on the upper wall and $\beta=1$ on
the upstream part of the lower wall. The linear amplification of the optimal
control resembles the maximum linear gain, which confirms the link between
recirculation length and amplification potential in this flow. Sensitivity
predictions for blowing/suction amplitudes up to $O(10^{-3})$ and wall
deformation amplitudes up to $O(10^{-2})$ are in good agreement with
three-dimensional direct numerical simulations.
  For larger wall deformation amplitudes, the flow becomes unsteady. This study
illustrates how the concept of second-order sensitivity and the associated
optimization method allow for a systematic exploration of the best candidates

and $G_{\textrm{e}}\times G_{\textrm{m}}$ a non-compact group with $SO(3)\times

the two classes of gauge groups can accommodate all the previous results on

approach for finding $dS_4$ vacua. In addition, relations between the embedding
tensors for gauge groups admitting $dS_4$ and $dS_5$ vacua are studied, and a
new gauge group, $SO(2,1)\times SO(4,1)$, with a $dS_4$ vacuum is found by
applying these relations to $SO(1,1)\times SO(4,1)$ gauge group in five

performance of test case generation for combinatorial interaction testing. This
paper investigates the effectiveness of the use of Binary Decision Diagrams
(BDDs) for constraint handling. BDDs are a data structure used to represent and
manipulate Boolean functions. The core role of a constraint handler is to
perform a check to determine if a partial test case with unspecified parameter
values satisfies the constraints. In the course of generating a test suite,
this check is executed a number of times; thus the efficiency of the check
significantly affects the overall time required for test case generation. In
the paper, we study two different approaches. The first approach performs this
check by computing the logical AND of Boolean functions that represent all
constraint-satisfying full test cases and a given partial test case. The second
approach uses a new technique to construct a BDD that represents all
constraint-satisfying partial test cases. With this BDD, the check can be
performed by simply traversing the BDD from the root to a sink. We developed a
program that incorporates both approaches into IPOG, a well-known test case
generation algorithm. Using this program, we empirically evaluate the
performance of these BDD-based constraint handling approaches using a total of
62 problem instances. In the evaluation, the two approaches are compared with
three different constraint handling approaches, namely, those based on Boolean
satisfiability (SAT) solving, Minimum Forbidden Tuples (MFTs), and Constraint
Satisfiction Problem (CSP) solving. The results of the evaluation show that the
two BDD-based approaches usually outperform the other constraint handling
techniques and that the BDD-based approach using the new technique exhibits
best performance.

Bayesian principles of the Kriging method are then used to design an estimator

relationship between the rate of change of the contact angle and the structure
of the transporting velocity field. The goal of the present work is to develop
an interface advection method that is consistent with the fundamental

Both methods deliver first-order convergent results for the motion of the

In the fields of biology
and chemistry, this is particularly important because some of the essential
molecules in life such as amino acids and DNA have chirality. It is a
long-standing mystery how one of the enantiomers was chosen at the beginning
stage of life. The understanding of the emergence of homochirality under some
conditions is indispensable for the study of the origin of life as well as
pharmaceutical science. The chirality is also emergent in magnetic structures.
The longitudinal helical magnetic structure is the chiral object composed of
magnetic moments, in which the ordered direction of the magnetic moment
spatially rotates in the plane perpendicular to the propagation vector (Fig.
1a). Since the sense of rotation, which is denoted as helicity, is reversed by
any mirror operation, it is corresponding to the chirality. Here we show that
the chirality of a longitudinal helical structure can be controlled by the
magnetic field and electric current owing to the spin-transfer torque
irrelevant to the spin-orbit interaction and probed by electrical magnetochiral
effect, which is sensitive to the chiral symmetry breaking, in an itinerant
helimagnet MnP. This phenomenon is distinct from the multiferroicity in
transverse-type insulating helical magnets, in which the helical plane is
parallel to the propagation vector, because the magnetic structure has polar
symmetry not chiral one. While the combination of the magnetic field and
electric current satisfies the symmetrical rule of external stimulus for the
chirality control, the control with them was not reported for any chiral object
previously. The present result may pave a new route to the control of
chiralities originating from magnetic and atomical arrangements.

control of the center of mass and center of pressure in legged robots, since
this is central for maintaining their balance with a limited support polygon.
Our approach is based on robust control theory, considering uncertainties that
can take any value between specified bounds. This provides a principled
approach to deciding optimal feedback gains. Surprisingly, our main observation
is that the sampling period can be as long as 200 ms with literally no impact
on maximum tracking error and, as a result, on the guarantee that balance can
be maintained safely. Our findings are validated in simulations and experiments
with the torque-controlled humanoid robot Toro developed at DLR. The proposed
mathematical derivations and results apply nevertheless equally to biped and
quadruped robots.

Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) based trackers gained more popularity
due to their efficiency, however, tracking in low-illumination environments is
a challenging problem, not yet successfully addressed in the literature. In
this work, we tackle the problems by introducing Low-Illumination Long-term
Correlation Tracker (LLCT). First, fused features only including HOG and Color
Names are employed to boost the tracking efficiency. Second, we used the
standard PCA to reduction scheme in the translation and scale estimation phase
for accelerating. Third, we learned a long-term correlation filter to keep the
long-term memory ability. Finally, update memory templates with interval
updates, then re-match existing and initial templates every few frames to
maintain template accuracy. The extensive experiments on popular Object
Tracking Benchmark OTB-50 datasets have demonstrated that the proposed tracker
outperforms the state-of-the-art trackers significantly achieves a high
real-time (33FPS) performance. In addition, the proposed approach can be
integrated easily in robot system and the running speed performed well. The
experimental results show that the novel tracker performance in
low-illumination environment is better than that of general trackers.

improved sensitivity offers no benefit. The best current solution for improving
the accuracy of the VLBI calibration is \MV\ VLBI, where multiple simultaneous
observations around the target are used to deduce the corrections required for
the line of sight to the target. We have estimated and quantified the
applicability of \MV\ from real-world ionospheric studies, making projections
into achievable astrometric accuracies. These predict systematic measurement
errors, with calibrators separated by several degrees, of $\sim$10\uas\ with
current VLBI facilities. For closer calibrators, that are in-beam for single
dish VLBI facilities, we predict systematic measurement errors of a few \uas.
This is the ideal combination, where the sensitivity of the SKA will provide

Eulerian and Lagrangian quantities are, and a confusion between the deformation
of an element of a surface and the creation of a new element of a surface.
Surface thermodynamics is complex because the surface quantities are not
'intuitive' (as surface excesses on some dividing surface) and the
thermodynamic variables of the state of a surface are a priori completely
unknown. This is why we introduced a new concept ('ideal transformation') and
presented detailed proof, leading to the determination of the 'local'
thermodynamic variables of the state of the surface, the exact expression of
the work of deformation of the surface, and the definition of surface stress,
for any deformable body (Olives 2010 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 22 085005,
arXiv:arXiv:1906.11022). These results are not obvious (despite their
similarity with some expressions in volume thermodynamics). We explicitly write
the Eulerian forms of (i) the relation between the surface grand potential per
unit area, the surface stress and the surface strain, showing its exact
equivalence with the Lagrangian form, and (ii) the variation of the surface
energy due to both the deformation of an element of the surface and the
creation of a new element of the surface.

operator results in the emergence of the SU(2)_{CS} and SU(2N_F) symmetries in

distributed among all modes of the Dirac operator, the magnetic interaction is
located at least predominantly in the near-zero modes. Given this observation
one could anticipate that above the pseudocritical temperature, where the
near-zero modes of the Dirac operator are suppressed, QCD is SU(2)_{CS} and
SU(2N_F) symmetric, which means absence of deconfinement in this regime.
Solution of the N_F=2 QCD on the lattice with a chirally symmetric Dirac

in the zonal (i.e., east-west) winds. On Jupiter, the reflective white bands of
low temperatures, elevated aerosol opacities, and enhancements of

anticyclonic zones via their temperature and wind characteristics, although
their relation to Saturn's albedo is not as clear as on Jupiter. On distant

attempt to reconcile the observed properties of belts and zones with (i) the
meridional overturning inferred from the convergence of eddy angular momentum
into the eastward zonal jets at the cloud level on Jupiter and Saturn and the
prevalence of moist convective activity in belts; and (ii) the opposing
meridional motions inferred from the upper tropospheric temperature structure,
which implies decay and dissipation of the zonal jets with altitude above the

directions, the former suggesting upwelling in belts, the latter suggesting
upwelling in zones. This presents an unresolved paradox for our current

covers of one or several query tracks -- has long been seen as a challenging
theoretical problem in the MIR community and as an acute practical problem for
authors and composers societies. Original algorithms proposed for this task
have proven their accuracy on small datasets, but are unable to scale up to
modern real-life audio corpora. On the other hand, faster approaches designed
to process thousands of pairwise comparisons resulted in lower accuracy, making
them unsuitable for practical use.
  In this work, we propose a neural network architecture that is trained to
represent each track as a single embedding vector. The computation burden is
therefore left to the embedding extraction -- that can be conducted offline and
stored, while the pairwise comparison task reduces to a simple Euclidean
distance computation. We further propose to extract each track's embedding out
of its dominant melody representation, obtained by another neural network
trained for this task. We then show that this architecture improves
state-of-the-art accuracy both on small and large datasets, and is able to
scale to query databases of thousands of tracks in a few seconds.

Korean VLBI Network in 2009-2015. Both species exhibit periodic flux variations
that correlate with the central star's optical light curve, with a phase delay
of up to 0.15 for the maser flux variations with respect to the optical light
curve. The flux densities of SiO v = 2, J = 1-0 and H2O masers decrease with
time, implying that they may disappear in 10-20 years. However, there seems to
have been a transient episode of intense H2O maser emission around 2010. We
also found a systematic behaviour in the velocity profiles of these masers. The
velocities of the H2O maser components appear to be remarkably constant,
suggesting ballistic motion for the bipolar outflow in this nebula. On the
other hand, those of the SiO maser clumps show a systematic radial acceleration
of the individual clumps, converging to the outflow velocity of the H2O maser
clumps. Measuring the full widths at zero power of the detected lines, we
estimated the expansion velocities of the compact bipolar outflow traced by H2O
maser and SiO thermal line, and discussed the possibility of the expanding SiO
maser region in the equatorial direction. All of our analyses support that the
central host star of OH231.8 is close to the tip of the AGB phase, and that the
mass-loss rate recently started to decrease because of incipient post-AGB

come with significant, non-linear errors in the depth measurements that
jeopardize robot tasks, like free-space detection, environment reconstruction

such systematic errors with the help of a second, more precise range sensor, in
our case a radial laser scanner. In contrast to what it may seem at first, this
does not mean a serious limitation in practice since these two sensors are
often mounted jointly in many mobile robotic platforms, as they complement well
each other. Moreover, the laser scanner can be used just for the calibration

i) the calibration is formulated from a probabilistic perspective through a
Maximum Likelihood Estimation problem, and ii) the proposed method can be
easily executed automatically by mobile robotic platforms. To validate the
proposed approach we evaluated for both, local distortion of 3D planar

of an ensemble of images, is a critical task for practitioners to estimate
variability of shapes inside a population, and to characterise and understand
how structural shape changes have an impact on health. This involves
identifying significant shape constituents of a set of images, a process called
segmentation, and mapping this group of images to an unknown mean image, a task
called registration, making a statistical analysis of the image population
possible. To achieve this goal, we propose treating these operations jointly to
leverage their positive mutual influence, in a hyperelasticity setting, by
viewing the shapes to be matched as Ogden materials.
  The approach is complemented by novel hard constraints on the $L^\infty$ norm
of both the Jacobian and its inverse, ensuring that the deformation is a
bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism. Segmentation is based on the Potts model, which
allows for a partition into more than two regions, i.e. more than one shape.
The connection to the registration problem is ensured by the dissimilarity
measure that aims to align the segmented shapes. A representation of the
deformation field in a linear space equipped with a scalar product is then
computed in order to perform a geometry-driven Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and to extract the main modes of variations inside the image population.
Theoretical results emphasizing the mathematical soundness of the model are
provided, among which existence of minimisers, analysis of a numerical method
of resolution, asymptotic results and a PCA analysis, as well as numerical

cyclic cost minimization. Attribute editing is then performed using the CRG

the optimal choice for $f_w$ is well understood, but less so the choice of $w$.
We study the properties of $\widehat \beta(w)$ as a function of~$w$ and show
that its expected time variance product decreases as $w$ decreases, even though
the cost of constructing the estimator increases with $w$. We also show that

search is the evaluation of candidate models within a predefined search space.
In practice, a one-shot supernet is trained to serve as an evaluator. A
faithful ranking certainly leads to more accurate searching results. However,
current methods are prone to making misjudgments. In this paper, we prove that
their biased evaluation is due to inherent unfairness in the supernet training.
In view of this, we propose two levels of constraints: expectation fairness and
strict fairness. Particularly, strict fairness ensures equal optimization
opportunities for all choice blocks throughout the training, which neither
overestimates nor underestimates their capacity. We demonstrate that this is
crucial for improving the confidence of models' ranking. Incorporating the
one-shot supernet trained under the proposed fairness constraints with a
multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm, we obtain various

the isotropic nature of fast modes is verified in the cases where the fast mode
is a significant fraction of the mode mixture. The fast mode behavior does not

convenient to describe the magnetic moments as bilinears of anticommuting
variables that are their own conjugates. However, we show how it is possible to
avoid having to deal directly with the anticommuting variables themselves, only
using them to deduce non-trivial constraints on the magnetoelastic couplings.
We construct the appropriate Poisson bracket and a geometric integration
scheme, that is symplectic in the extended phase space and that allows us to
study the switching properties of the magnetization, that are relevant for
applications, for the case of a toy model for antiferromagnetic NiO, under
external stresses. In the absence of magnetoelastic coupling, we recover the
results reported in the literature and in our previous studies. In the presence
of the magnetoelastic coupling, the characteristic oscillations of the
mechanical system have repercussions on the N\'eel order parameter dynamics.
This is particularly striking for the spin accumulation which is more than
doubled by the coupling to the strain ; here as well, the mechanical
oscillations are reflected on the magnetic dynamics. As a consequence of such a
stress induced strain, the switching time of the magnetization is slightly
faster and the amplitude of the magnetization enhanced.

be intimately related with the 3dx2-y2 orbital order.The occurrence of IC-CO
has been attributed to the mixed character (itinerant/localized) of
eg-electrons undergoing Fermi-surface nesting of 3dx2-y2 band causing
electronic instability, which opens a gap through a charge density wave (CDW)
mechanism. This feature appears to share proximity with the high-Tc cuprates.
At lower temperatures, the CDW phase undergoes SDW transition, which changes

high-cardinality string categorical variables. Ideally, these should be:
scalable to many categories; interpretable to end users; and facilitate
statistical analysis. We introduce two encoding approaches for string
categories: a Gamma-Poisson matrix factorization on substring counts, and the
min-hash encoder, for fast approximation of string similarities. We show that
min-hash turns set inclusions into inequality relations that are easier to

high-cardinality categorical variables. We recommend the following: if
scalability is central, the min-hash encoder is the best option as it does not
require any data fit; if interpretability is important, the Gamma-Poisson
factorization is the best alternative, as it can be interpreted as one-hot
encoding on inferred categories with informative feature names. Both models

the design, implementation, and deployment of an advertisement auditing system
called iWnder that uses crowdsourcing to reveal in real time whether a display
advertisement has been targeted or not. Crowdsourcing simplifies the detection
of targeted advertising, but requires reporting to a central repository the
impressions seen by different users, thereby jeopardising their privacy. We
break this deadlock with a privacy preserving data sharing protocol that allows
iWnder to compute global statistics required to detect targeting, while keeping
the advertisements seen by individual users and their browsing history private.
We conduct a simulation study to explore the effect of different parameters and
a live validation to demonstrate the accuracy of our approach. Unlike previous
solutions, iWnder can even detect indirect targeting, i.e., marketing campaigns
that promote a product or service whose description bears no semantic overlap
with its targeted audience.

$d$-degenerate graph $G$. Can we transform one into the other by recoloring one
vertex at each step while maintaining a proper coloring at any step? Cereceda
et al. answered that question in the affirmative, and exhibited a recolouring
sequence of exponential length.
  If $k=d+2$, we know that there exists graphs for which a quadratic number of
recolorings is needed. And when $k=2d+2$, there always exists a linear
transformation. In this paper, we prove that, as long as $k \ge d+4$, there
exists a transformation of length at most $f(\Delta) \cdot n$ between any pair
of $k$-colorings of chordal graphs (where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree
of the graph). The proof is constructive and provides a linear time algorithm
that, given two $k$-colorings $c_1,c_2$ computes a linear transformation
between $c_1$ and $c_2$.

the phonon modes is dominated by a strong Rayleigh mode, in contrast to
previous experimental works. Moreover, also at variance with recent reports, no

using quadrature methods, which may become a computational bottleneck even for

tends to a finite limit depending only on $L$. This was previously observed in
the special case when $L$ is a circle of radius $r$ (Fodor, Kevei and V\'igh

with large morphological variability. An individualized assessment of its shape
is essential for clinical applications related to tonotopy and cochlear
implantation. To unambiguously reference morphological parameters, reliable
recognition of the cochlear modiolar axis in computed tomography (CT) images is
required. The conventional method introduces measurement uncertainties, as it
is based on manually selected and difficult to identify landmarks. Herein, we
present an algorithm for robust modiolar axis detection in clinical CT images.
We define the modiolar axis as the rotation component of the kinematic spiral
motion inherent in the cochlear shape. For surface fitting, we use a compact
shape representation in a 7-dimensional kinematic parameter space based on
extended Pl\""ucker coordinates. It is the first time such a kinematic
representation is used for shape analysis in medical images. Robust surface
fitting is achieved with an adapted approximate maximum likelihood method
assuming a Student-t distribution, enabling axis detection even in partially
available surface data. We verify the algorithm performance on a synthetic data
set with cochlear surface subsets. In addition, we perform an experimental
study with four experts in 23 human cochlea CT data sets to compare the
automated detection with the manually found axes. Axes found from co-registered
high resolution micro-CT scans are used for reference. Our experiments show
that the algorithm reduces the alignment error providing more reliable modiolar
axis detection for clinical and research applications.

decomposition $\Theta_V=\Theta^+_V-\Theta^-_V$, i.e., treating $\Theta_V$ as
the difference of two positive operators $\Theta^\pm_V$, each of which
characterizes the transition of states for one branch of particles. Despite the
fact that the first moments of such models solve the Wigner equation, we prove
that the bounds of corresponding variances grow exponentially in time with the
rate depending on the upper bound of $\Theta^\pm_V$, instead of $\Theta_V$. In
other words, the decay of high-frequency components is totally ignored,
resulting in a severe {numerical sign problem}. {To fully utilize such decay
property}, we have recourse to the stationary phase approximation for
$\Theta_V$, which captures essential contributions from the stationary phase
points as well as the near-cancelation of positive and negative weights. The
resulting branching random walk solutions are then proved to asymptotically
solve the Wigner equation, but {gain} a substantial reduction in variances,

simultaneously predicts risks for thousands of diagnosis codes and thereby
establishes a comprehensive patient risk profile. Here we show that such

symmetric dynamical acoustic black hole with a moving horizon. In this
symmetric spacetime, the marginally outer trapped surface and the so called
evolving horizon are degenerate. Interestingly, there are many ways of
assigning a surface gravity to the horizon in the absence of time translation
invariance. Here, we present two of them that are distinguished by whether they
are defined only locally or take into account the global properties of
spacetime outside the black hole. It is expected that a dynamical black hole
would emit spontaneous thermal radiation and its temperature would be
proportional to a surface gravity of the moving horizon but there is no
consensus on which of the surface gravities would give the Hawking temperature.
We propose that a non-stationary analogue spacetime when realised

  2019 (ALIFE 2019), MIT Press",,,,"q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human social hierarchy has the unique characteristic of existing in two
forms. Firstly, as an informal hierarchy where leaders and followers are
implicitly defined by their personal characteristics, and secondly, as an
institutional hierarchy where leaders and followers are explicitly appointed by
group decision. Although both forms can reduce the time spent in organising
collective tasks, institutional hierarchy imposes additional costs. It is
therefore natural to question why it emerges at all. The key difference lies in
the fact that institutions can create hierarchy with only a single leader,
which is unlikely to occur in unregulated informal hierarchy. To investigate if
this difference can affect group decision-making and explain the evolution of
institutional hierarchy, we first build an opinion-formation model that
simulates group decision making. We show that in comparison to informal
hierarchy, a single-leader hierarchy reduces (i) the time a group spends to
reach consensus, (ii) the variation in consensus time, and (iii) the rate of
increase in consensus time as group size increases. We then use this model to
simulate the cost of organising a collective action which produces resources,
and integrate this into an evolutionary model where individuals can choose
between informal or institutional hierarchy. Our results demonstrate that
groups evolve preferences towards institutional hierarchy, despite the cost of
creating an institution, as it provides a greater organisational advantage
which is less affected by group size and inequality.

strongly interferes with previously learned representations. Since it is
unrealistic to provide artificial agents with all the necessary prior knowledge
to effectively operate in real-world conditions, they must exhibit a rich set
of learning capabilities enabling them to interact in complex environments with
the aim to process and make sense of continuous streams of (often uncertain)

we focus on continual learning for autonomous agents and robots required to

computational counterparts for modeling the progressive acquisition of
increasingly complex knowledge and skills in a continual fashion.

this complexity during development is to encapsulate features into a shared
library. This allows developers to reuse already implemented features instead
of reimplementing them over and over again. However, not all features provided
by a shared library are actually used by an application. As a result, an
application using shared libraries loads unused code into memory, which an
attacker can use to perform code-reuse and similar types of attacks. The same
holds for applications written in a scripting language such as PHP or Ruby: The
interpreter typically offers much more functionality than is actually required
by the application and hence provides a larger overall attack surface.
  In this paper, we tackle this problem and propose a first step towards
automated application-specific software stacks. We present a compiler extension
capable of removing unneeded code from shared libraries and---with the help of
domain knowledge---also capable of removing unused functionalities from an
interpreter's code base during the compilation process. Our evaluation against
a diverse set of real-world applications, among others Nginx, Lighttpd, and the
PHP interpreter, removes on average 71.3% of the code in musl-libc, a popular
libc implementation. The evaluation on web applications show that a tailored
PHP interpreter can mitigate entire vulnerability classes, as is the case for
OpenConf. We demonstrate the applicability of our debloating approach by
creating an application-specific software stack for a Wordpress web
application: we tailor the libc library to the Nginx web server and PHP
interpreter, whereas the PHP interpreter is tailored to the Wordpress web
application. In this real-world scenario, the code of the libc is decreased by
65.1% in total, thereby reducing the available code for code-reuse attacks.

developed. A user's sense of agency (SoA) decreases with increasing system
assistance, possibly resulting in a decrease in the user's sense of
fulfillment. This study aims to provide a design guideline for an assistive
method to maintain and improve the sense of fulfillment with SoA. We propose a
mathematical model describing the mechanisms by which the assistive method
affects SoA and SoA induces a sense of fulfillment. The experience in the flow
state is assumed to be a sense of fulfillment. The assistance effect on the
skill-challenge plane in flow theory is defined as an increase in skill and
decrease in challenge. The factor that separates the two effects from
attribution theory is the locus of causality, which is matched to the judgement
of agency (JoA) from the two-step account of agency. We hypothesized that the
assistance increases the perception of skill and sense of fulfillment is
greater when the locus of causality is internal, rather than external. To
verify this hypothesis, a game task experiment was conducted with assistance
that varied with the ease of recognition. We hypothesized that a player's JoA
is internal for hard-to-recognize assistance, resulting in a high sense of
fulfillment. Experimental results supported this hypothesis.

research and epidemiology. Most IV analyses use naturally occurring
instruments, such as distance to a hospital. In these analyses, investigators
must assume the instrument is as-if randomly assigned. This assumption cannot
be tested directly, but it can be falsified. Most falsification tests in the
literature compare relative prevalence or bias in observed covariates between
the instrument and the exposure. These tests require investigators to make a
covariate-by-covariate judgment about the validity of the IV design. Often,
only some of the covariates are well-balanced, making it unclear if as-if
randomization can be assumed for the instrument across all covariates. We
propose an alternative falsification test that compares IV balance or bias to
the balance or bias that would have been produced under randomization. A key
advantage of our test is that it allows for global balance measures as well as
easily interpretable graphical comparisons. Furthermore, our test does not rely
on any parametric assumptions and can be used to validly assess if the
instrument is significantly closer to being as-if randomized than the exposure.
We demonstrate our approach on a recent IV application that uses bed

least-squares type, closed-form solution. The proposed estimator is shown to be
strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. A simulation study shows that
our estimator performs satisfactorily and has an advantage over a competing
alternative based on jittering. Our methods can be applied to a large variety

of NGC 7469 gathered during an XMM-Newton observing campaign in 2015. Results.
We find the emission line region in NGC 7469 to be multiphased, consisting of
two narrow components with ionisation parameters of $\log \xi = 0.4$ and 1.6. A
third, broad emission component, with a broadening velocity of $v_b \sim 1400$
km s\textsuperscript{-1} and an outflow velocity of $v_{out} \sim -4500$ km
s\textsuperscript{-1}, is required to fit the residuals in the O VII triplet,
at around 22 \AA. Assuming a volume filling factor of 0.1, the lower distance
limits of the narrow emission line region components are estimated for the
first time at 2.6 and 2.5 pc from the central black hole, whereas the broad
component has an estimated lower bound distance between 0.004 to 0.03 pc,
depending on the assumed plasma parameters. The collisionally ionised plasma
from the star burst region in NGC 7469 has a plasma temperature of 0.32 keV and
outflow velocity of $-280$ km s\textsuperscript{-1}, consistent with previous
results in this campaign. In addition, we model the photoionised plasma of the
warm absorber (WA) in NGC 7469, and find that it consists of three photoionised
phases, with different values of $\xi$, $N_H$ and $v_{out}$. The upper bound
distances of these WA components are 1.9, 0.3 and 0.6 pc, respectively,
consistent with archival results. Conclusions. The environment of NGC 7469 is a
complex mix of plasma winds absorbing and emitting X-rays. We find the picture
painted by our results can be attributed to line emitting plasma located at
distances ranging from near the black hole to the torus and beyond the ionised
outflows.

couple to polar optic phonons in anisotropic media, confining long-wavelength
light to nanoscale volumes. However, to realize the full potential of HPhPs for
infrared optics, it is crucial to understand propagation and loss mechanisms on
substrates suitable for applications from waveguiding to infrared sensing. In
this paper, we employ scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy
(s-SNOM) and nano-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in concert
with analytical and numerical calculations, to elucidate HPhP characteristics
as a function of the complex substrate dielectric function. We consider
propagation on suspended, dielectric and metallic substrates to demonstrate
that the thickness-normalized wavevector can be reduced by a factor of 25
simply by changing the substrate from dielectric to metallic behavior.
Moreover, by incorporating the imaginary contribution to the dielectric
function in lossy materials, the wavevector can be dynamically controlled by
small local variations in loss or carrier density. Such effects may therefore
be used to spatially separate hyperbolic modes of different orders, and
indicates that for index-based sensing schemes that HPhPs can be more sensitive
than surface polaritons in the thin film limit. Our results advance our
understanding of fundamental polariton excitations and their potential for
on-chip photonics and planar metasurface optics.

understand the origin of these objects, we carry out hydrodynamical simulations
of planetary cores embedded in a nascent protoplanetary disk. In this first
paper of a series, to gain intuition as well as to develop useful diagnostics,
we focus on two-dimensional simulations of the flow around protoplanetary
cores. We use the pluto code to study isothermal and adiabatic envelopes around
cores of sub- to super-thermal masses, fully resolving the envelope properties
down to the core surface. Owing to the conservation of vortensity, envelopes
acquire a substantial degree of rotational support when the core mass increases
beyond the thermal mass, suggesting a limited applicability of one-dimensional
models for describing the envelope structure. The finite size of the core
(relatively large for super-Earths) also controls the amount of rotational
support in the entire envelope. Steady non-axisymmetric shocks develop in the
supersonic envelopes of high-mass cores, triggering mass accretion and
turbulent mixing in their interiors. We also examine the influence of the gas
self-gravity on the envelope structure. Although it only weakly alters the
properties of the envelopes, the gas gravity has significant effect on the
properties of the density waves triggered by the core in the protoplanetary
disk.

grounded in theoretical computer science and numerical linear algebra, and
which finds that an algorithmically desirable sketch, which is a randomly

property known as a subspace embedding. Building on this work, we study how
prediction and inference can be affected by data sketching within a linear

sample size effect which a researcher can control. As a sketch size that is
algorithmically optimal may not be suitable for prediction and inference, we
use statistical arguments to provide 'inference conscious' guides to the sketch
size. When appropriately implemented, an estimator that pools over different
sketches can be nearly as efficient as the infeasible one using the full

significantly modifies the dynamics of the photo-excited tetracene crystal,

enhanced delayed fluorescence is attributed to the emergence of an additional

wavelength dependent, and can be explained by the direct emission from the
lower polariton band, the more effcient light out-coupling and the enhancement

predictive power is based on a strong assumption of independent free choice, in
which the physicists pick a measurement axis independently of anything that
couldn't have been caused by their decision.
  Independent free choice is also at the core of the Nash equilibrium and
classical game theory. A more recent line of game-theoretical research based on
weakening free choice leads to non-trivial solution concepts with desirable
properties such as at-most uniqueness, Pareto optimality, and contextuality.
  We show how introducing contingent free choice in the foundations of quantum
theory yields a class of deterministic and contextual theories with an improved
predictive power, and contrast them with the pilot-wave theory.
  Specifically, we suggest that quantum experiments, such as the EPR
experiment, involving measurements located in spacetime, can be recast as
dynamic games with imperfect information involving human agents and the
universe. The underlying idea is that a physicist picking a measurement axis
and the universe picking a measurement outcome are two faces of the same
physical contingency phenomenon.
  The classical, Nashian resolution of these games based on independent free
choice is analogous to local hidden variable theories, constrained by the Bell
inequalities. On the other hand, in a setup in which agents are rational and
omniscient in all possible worlds, under contingent free choice, the Perfectly
Transparent Equilibrium provides a contextual resolution, based on the iterated
elimination of inconsistent worlds, towards an at-most unique possible world,
in which the outcomes of measurements that actually are carried out, and only
them, are deterministically defined.

and low-noise quantum information processing devices. In this work, we suggest
an approach for suppressing errors by employing pre-processing and
post-processing unitary operations, which precede and follow the action of a
decoherence channel. In contrast to quantum error correction and
measurement-based methods, the suggested approach relies on specifically
designed unitary operators for a particular state without the need in ancillary
qubits or post-selection procedures. We consider the case of decoherence
channels acting on a single qubit belonging to a many-qubit state.
Pre-processing and post-processing operators can be either individual, that is
acting on the qubit effected by the decoherence channel only, or collective,
that is acting on the whole multi-qubit state. We give a classification of
possible strategies for the protection scheme, analyze them, and derive
expressions for the optimal unitary operators providing the maximal value of
the fidelity regarding initial and final states. Specifically, we demonstrate
the equivalence of the schemes where one of the unitary operations is
individual while the other is collective. We then consider the realization of
our approach for the basic decoherence models, which include single-qubit
depolarizing, dephasing, and amplitude damping channels. We also demonstrate
that the decoherence robustness of multi-qubit states for these decoherence
models is determined by the entropy of the reduced state of the qubit
undergoing the decoherence channel.

spaces are subsets of $R^m$ and cost/utility functions are parameterized by
some common vector $u\in R^m$ and, otherwise, only depend on the own strategy
choice. A strategy of a player can be interpreted as a vector of resource
consumption and a joint strategy profile naturally leads to an aggregate
consumption vector. Resources can be priced, that is, the game is augmented by
a price vector $\lambda\in R^m_+$ and players have quasi-linear overall
costs/utilities meaning that in addition to the original costs/utilities, a
player needs to pay the corresponding price per consumed unit. We investigate
the following question: for which aggregated consumption vectors $u$ can we
find prices $\lambda$ that induce an equilibrium realizing the targeted
consumption profile?
  For answering this question, we revisit a well-known duality-based framework
and derive several characterizations of the existence of such $u$ and $\lambda$
using convexification techniques. We show that for finite strategy spaces or
certain concave games, the equilibrium existence problem reduces to solving a
well-structured LP. We then consider a class of monotone aggregative games
having the property that the cost/utility functions of players may depend on
the induced load of a strategy profile. For this class, we show a sufficient
condition of enforceability based on the previous characterizations. We
demonstrate that this framework can help to unify parts of four largely
independent streams in the literature: tolls in transportation systems,
Walrasian market equilibria, trading networks and congestion control in
communication networks.

In order to achieve network level coordination in a scalable manner, scheduling
agents communicate only with their direct neighbors. Each time an agent
generates a new intersection schedule it communicates its expected outflows to
its downstream neighbors as a prediction of future demand and these outflows
are appended to the downstream agent's locally perceived demand. In this paper,
we extend this basic coordination algorithm to additionally incorporate the
complementary flow of information reflective of an intersection's current
congestion level to its upstream neighbors. We present an asynchronous
decentralized algorithm for updating intersection schedules and congestion
level estimates based on these bi-directional information flows. By relating
this algorithm to the self-optimized decision making of the basic operation, we
are able to approach network-wide optimality and reduce inefficiency due to
strictly self-interested intersection control decisions.

feedback between marsh grass and sediment volume is particularly of interest.
Locally, the marsh vegetation attenuates hydrodynamic energy, enhancing
sediment accretion and promoting further vegetation growth. In turn, the
diverted water flow promotes the formation of erosion troughs over longer
distances. This scale-dependent feedback may explain the characteristic
spatially varying marsh shoreline, commonly observed in nature. We propose a
mathematical framework to model grass-sediment dynamics as a system of

use a Mexican-hat kernel function to model this scale-dependent feedback. We
perform a steady state biharmonic approximation of our system and derive

intrinsic methods, we mean methods that rely only on the model and the training
data, as opposed to traditional methods (we call them extrinsic methods) that
rely on performance on a test set or on bounds from model complexity. We
propose a family of intrinsic methods, called Counterfactual Simulation (CFS),
which analyze the flow of training examples through the model by identifying
and perturbing rare patterns. By applying CFS to logic circuits we get a method
that has no hyper-parameters and works uniformly across different types of
models such as neural networks, random forests and lookup tables.
Experimentally, CFS can separate models with different levels of overfit using
only their logic circuit representations without any access to the high level
structure. By comparing lookup tables, neural networks, and random forests
using CFS, we get insight into why neural networks generalize. In particular,
we find that stochastic gradient descent in neural nets does not lead to ""brute
force"" memorization, but finds common patterns (whether we train with actual or
randomized labels), and neural networks are not unlike forests in this regard.
Finally, we identify a limitation with our proposal that makes it unsuitable in
an adversarial setting, but points the way to future work on robust intrinsic
methods.

tremendous attentions for solving large-scale machine learning and signal
processing problems due to the relative simplicity. However, the two-block
structure of the classical ADMM still limits the size of the real problems
being solved. When one forces a more-than-two-block structure by
variable-splitting, the convergence speed slows down greatly as observed in
practice. Recently, a randomly assembled cyclic multi-block ADMM (RAC-MBADMM)
was developed by the authors for solving general convex and nonconvex quadratic
optimization problems where the number of blocks can go greater than two so
that each sub-problem has a smaller size and can be solved much more
efficiently. In this paper, we apply this method to solving few selected
machine learning problems related to convex quadratic optimization, such as
Linear Regression, LASSO, Elastic-Net, and SVM. We prove that the algorithm
would converge in expectation linearly under the standard statistical data
assumptions. We use our general-purpose solver to conduct multiple numerical
tests, solving both synthetic and large-scale bench-mark problems. Our results
show that RAC-MBADMM could significantly outperform, in both solution time and
quality, other optimization algorithms/codes for solving these machine learning
problems, and match up the performance of the best tailored methods such as
Glmnet or LIBSVM. In certain problem regions RAC-MBADMM even achieves a
superior performance than that of the tailored methods.

Adversarial images are commonly generated by perturbing images to introduce
high frequency noise that induces image misclassification, but that is fragile

reconstruct an image under adversarial constraint induces perturbations that

Furthermore we show that our DIP approach can also be adapted to produce local

high-redshift (z =1.8385) FSRQ PKS 1502+106. Utilizing multi-band data from
radio to $\gamma$-ray and optical polarization observations, we investigate two
dramatic activities in detail: a $\gamma$-ray dominated outburst in 2015 and an
optical dominated outburst in 2017. Our main results are as follows. (I) A fast
$\gamma$-ray flare with a flux-doubling time-scale as short as 1-hr in 2015 is
discovered. Based on the variability time-scale, the physical parameters of the
flaring region (e.g, minimum Doppler factor, emission region size, etc.) are
constrained. At the peak of the flare, the $\gamma$-ray spectrum hardens to
$\Gamma_{\gamma} = 1.82\pm0.04$ and exhibits an obvious curvature/break
characteristic that is caused by the typical ""cooling break"". Modelings of
multi-band SEDs reveal a very hard electronic energy spectrum with the
electronic spectral index of $1.07\pm0.53$. This result suggests that this fast
$\gamma$-ray flare may be triggered by magnetic reconnection. (II) During the
outburst in 2017, the optical polarization degree and optical fluxes show a
very tight correlation. By analyzing Stokes parameters of polarization
observations, our results show that this outburst could be triggered by a
transverse shock with a compression ratio of $\eta> 2.2$, and the magnetic
field intensity of the shock emission region is about $0.032$ G.

the electric field is due to a contribution depending on the circulation on the
contour in a Biot-Savart way plus another one taking into account the angular
variations of the potential in $\mathcal{A}$ valid for any closed loop $c$. The
approach is used to find exact expansions solutions of the electric field for
circular contours with fully periodic potentials. Analytical results are
validated with numerical computations and the Finite Element Method.

In this paper, an efficient surrogate strategy is proposed to investigate the
behavior of an oscillator of Duffing's type in combination with an
elasto-plastic friction force model. Relevant quantities of interest are
discussed. Sticking time is considered using a machine learning technique based
on Gaussian processes called kriging. The largest Lyapunov exponent is proposed
as an efficient indicator of non-regular behavior. This indicator is estimated
using a perturbation method. A dedicated adaptive kriging strategy for
classification called MiVor is utilized and appears to be highly proficient in
order to detect instabilities over the parametric space and can furthermore be
used for complex response surfaces in multi-dimensional parametric domains.

while limiting the false positives due to visually similar images. Since the
rate of false alarms grows with the dataset size, a very high specificity is
thus required, up to $1 - 10^{-9}$ for realistic use cases; this important
requirement, however, is often overlooked in literature. In recent years,
descriptors based on deep convolutional neural networks have matched or
surpassed traditional feature extraction methods in content-based image
retrieval tasks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to
establish the performance range of deep learning-based descriptors for
unsupervised near-duplicate detection on a range of datasets, encompassing a
broad spectrum of near-duplicate definitions. We leverage both established and
new benchmarks, such as the Mir-Flick Near-Duplicate (MFND) dataset, in which a

reduce the problem of unsupervised detection to that of binary classification
of near-duplicate vs. not-near-duplicate images. The latter can be conveniently
characterized using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC). Our findings in general
favor the choice of fine-tuning deep convolutional networks, as opposed to
using off-the-shelf features, but differences at high specificity settings

communications. The key idea behind SM is to convey additional information
typically through the ON/OFF states of transmit antennas and simultaneously
save the implementation cost by reducing the number of radio frequency chains.
As a result, the SM concept can have widespread effects on diverse applications
and can be applied in other signal domains such as frequency/time/code/angle
domain or even across multiple domains. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of the latest results and progresses in SM research. Specifically, the
fundamental principles, variants of system design, and enhancements of SM are
described in detail. Furthermore, the integration of the SM family with other

is employed to record the trajectories and topological changes of the droplets
of different liquids. The droplet size, the orientation of the air nozzle to
the horizontal and fluid properties (surface tension and viscosity) are varied
to study different breakup modes. We found that droplet possessing initial
momentum prior to entering the continuous air stream exhibits a variation in
the required Weber number for the vibrational to the bag breakup transition
with a change in the angle of the air stream. The critical Weber numbers
$(We_{cr})$ for the bag-type breakup are obtained as a function of the
E\""{o}tv\""{o}s number $(Eo)$, angle of inclination of the air stream $(\alpha)$
and the Ohnesorge number $(Oh)$. It is found that although the droplet follows
a rectilinear motion initially that transforms to a curvilinear motion at later
times when the droplet undergoes topological changes. The apparent acceleration
of the droplet and its size influence the critical Weber number for the bag
breakup mode. The departure from the cross-flow arrangement shows a sharp
decrease in the critical Weber number for the bag breakup which asymptotically
reaches to a value associated with the in-line (opposed) flow configuration for
the droplet breakup.

issues, the primordial black hole (PBH) is a crucial topic. However, so far the
existence of PBHs is still not confirmed, and currently running GW detectors
are still not able to distinguish them from the normal astrophysical BHs. In
this article, we propose that the GWs (of PBH binary mergers) could interact
with the very widespread background galactic magnetic fields in the Milky way,
to produce the perturbed electromagnetic waves (EMWs) with unique
characteristics of frequencies, waveforms, spectra and polarizations. In order
to be distinguished from astrophysical black holes, only the PBHs with masses
less than the solarmass are considered here, and their binary mergers will
radiate GWs in frequencies much higher above the plasma frequency of
interstellar medium (ISM), so corresponding perturbed EMWs (in the same
frequencies to such GWs) can propagate through the ISM until the Earth. Our
estimations show that, for the sub-solar mass PBH binary mergers within the
Milky way (disk or halo), the strengths of the perturbed EMWs turn into
constant levels around 10^{-12} Tesla (for magnetic components) and around
10^{-10}Watt m^{-2} (for energy flux densities) at the Earth, generally for all
cases of different PBH masses (and not dependent on the distance of sources),
and the same mass ratio of the PBH binary gives the same strength (at the
Earth) of perturbed EMWs despite different PBH masses (GW frequencies) or
binary distances. Differently, for the PBH binary mergers outside the Milky
way, the perturbed EMWs at Earth have lower strengths (and depend on the
distance of sources), but for some part of distance range, they would also be
detectable. If such EM signals and special EM counterpart of GWs from PBHs
could be detected by space- or land-based EMWs detectors, it may provide direct
evidence of the PBHs.

smaller stresses. The former makes model choice increasingly important in the
plastic region, while the elastic region remains insensitive to these changes.
We also find that, for a fixed total stress at the inner wall, materials
experience larger deformations and generally larger stresses as they transition
from impermeable to fully permeable.

appealing yet challenging. A prior based on animal data may place large
probability mass on values of the dose-toxicity model parameter(s), which
appear infeasible in light of data accrued from the ongoing phase I clinical
trial. In this paper, we seek to use animal data to improve decision making in
a model-based dose-escalation procedure for phase I oncology trials.
Specifically, animal data are incorporated via a robust mixture prior for the
parameters of the dose-toxicity relationship. This prior changes dynamically as
the trial progresses. After completion of treatment for each cohort, the weight
allocated to the informative component, obtained based on animal data alone, is
updated using a decision-theoretic approach to assess the commensurability of
the animal data with the human toxicity data observed thus far. In particular,
we measure commensurability as a function of the utility of optimal prior
predictions for the human responses (toxicity or no toxicity) on each
administered dose. The proposed methodology is illustrated through several
examples and an extensive simulation study. Results show that our proposal can
address difficulties in coping with prior-data conflict commencing in
sequential trials with a small sample size.

using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) was investigated.
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis suggests that the
samples grow through a tip growth mechanism. High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements show multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs) with bamboo structure for Ni catalyst while iron filled straight tubes
were obtained with the Fe catalyst. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
indicates that nanotubes are graphitic in nature and there is no trace of
carbide phases in both the cases. Low frequency Raman analysis of the
bamboo-like and filled CNTs confirms the presence of radial breathing modes
(RBM). The degree of graphitization of CNTs synthesized from Fe catalyst is
higher than that from Ni catalyst as demonstrated by the high frequency Raman
analysis. Simple models for the growth of bamboo-like and tubular catalyst
filled nanotubes are proposed.

  Household Appliances","19 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.MM eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy disaggregation, a.k.a. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring, aims to separate
the energy consumption of individual appliances from the readings of a mains
power meter measuring the total energy consumption of, e.g. a whole house.
Energy consumption of individual appliances can be useful in many applications,
e.g., providing appliance-level feedback to the end users to help them
understand their energy consumption and ultimately save energy. Recently, with
the availability of large-scale energy consumption datasets, various neural
network models such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural
networks have been investigated to solve the energy disaggregation problem.
Neural network models can learn complex patterns from large amounts of data and
have been shown to outperform the traditional machine learning methods such as
variants of hidden Markov models. However, current neural network methods for
energy disaggregation are either computational expensive or are not capable of
handling long-term dependencies. In this paper, we investigate the application
of the recently developed WaveNet models for the task of energy disaggregation.
Based on a real-world energy dataset collected from 20 households over two
years, we show that WaveNet models outperforms the state-of-the-art deep
learning methods proposed in the literature for energy disaggregation in terms
of both error measures and computational cost. On the basis of energy
disaggregation, we then investigate the performance of two deep-learning based
frameworks for the task of on/off detection which aims at estimating whether an
appliance is in operation or not. Based on the same dataset, we show that for
the task of on/off detection the second framework, i.e., directly training a
binary classifier, achieves better performance in terms of F1 score.

fabricated using a chemical route to prepare the $CZTS$ films, consisting in
sequential deposition of $Cu_2SnS_3$ (CTS) and $ZnS$ thin films followed by
annealing at $550^\circ C$ in nitrogen atmosphere. The $CTS$ compound was
prepared in a one-step process using a novel chemical procedure consisting of
simultaneous precipitation of $Cu_2S$ and $SnS_2$ performed by diffusion
membranes assisted $CBD$ (chemical bath deposition) technique. Diffusion
membranes were used to optimize the kinetic growth through a moderate control
of release of metal ions into the work solution. As the conditions for the
formation in one step of the $Cu_2SnS_3$ compound have not yet been reported in
literature, special emphasis was put on finding the parameters that allow
growing the $Cu_2SnS_3$ thin films by simultaneous precipitation of $Cu_2S$ and
$SnS_2$. For that, we propose a methodology that includes numerical solution of
the equilibrium equations that were established through a study of the chemical
equilibrium of the system $SnCl_2$, $Na_3C_6H_5O_7\cdot 2H2O$, $CuCl_2$ and
$Na_2S_2O_3\cdot5H_2O$. The formation of thin films of $CTS$ and $CZTS$ free of
secondary phases grown with a stoichiometry close to that corresponding to the
$Cu_2SnS_3$ and $Cu_2ZnSnS_4$ phases, was verified through measurements of
X-ray diffraction $(XRD)$ and Raman spectroscopy. Solar cell with an efficiency
of $4.2%$, short circuit current of $16.2 mA/cm^2$ and open-circuit voltage of
0.49 V was obtained.
