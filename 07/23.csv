developments in the area of Internet of Things advance. Another technology
gaining more attention is data stream processing systems. Although such
streaming frameworks seem to be a natural fit for Industry 4.0 scenarios, their
application in this context is still low. The contributions in this paper are
threefold. Firstly, we present industry findings that we derived from site
inspections with a focus on Industry 4.0. Moreover, our view on Industry 4.0
and important related aspects is elaborated. As a third contribution, we
illustrate our opinion on why data stream processing technologies could act as
an enabler for Industry 4.0 and point out possible obstacles on this way.

spin-orbit coupling, increased hybridization, and more diffuse orbitals.
Combining these properties leads to novel behavior. Sr$_3$NiIrO$_6$, for
example, displays complex magnetism and ultra-high coercive fields - up to an
incredible 55~T. Here, we combine infrared and optical spectroscopies with
high-field magnetization and first principles calculations to explore the
fundamental excitations of the lattice and related coupling processes including
spin-lattice and electron-phonon mechanisms. Magneto-infrared spectroscopy
reveals spin-lattice coupling of three phonons that modulate the Ir environment
to reduce the energy required to modify the spin arrangement. While these modes
primarily affect exchange within the chains, analysis also uncovers important
inter-chain motion. This provides a mechanism by which inter-chain interactions
can occur in the developing model for ultra-high coercivity. At the same time,
analysis of the on-site Ir$^{4+}$ excitations reveals vibronic coupling and
extremely large crystal field parameters that lead to a t$_{2g}$-derived
low-spin state for Ir. These findings highlight the spin-charge-lattice
entanglement in Sr$_3$NiIrO$_6$ and suggest that similar interactions may take
place in other 3$d$/5$d$ hybrids.

considered as a knowledge graph that focuses both on these knowledge components
and knowledge structure of a scientific domain by examining the relationships
between knowledge entities. Using data from two multidisciplinary research
domains other than the medical domain, capitalizing on bibliometrics, the
dynamicity of temporal KCNs, and a Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural
network, this study proposed a framework to successfully predict the future
literature-based discoveries - the emerging connections among knowledge units.
Framing the problem as a dynamic supervised link prediction task, the proposed
framework integrates some novel node and edge-level features. Temporal

forecast the feature values for positive and negatively labeled non-connected

solutions to semilinear elliptic equations are bounded (and thus smooth) in
dimension $n \leq 9$.
  This result, that was only known to be true for $n\leq4$, is optimal:
$\log(1/|x|^2)$ is a $W^{1,2}$ singular stable solution for $n\geq10$.
  The proof of this conjecture is a consequence of a new universal estimate: we
prove that, in dimension $n \leq 9$, stable solutions are bounded in terms only
of their $L^1$ norm, independently of the nonlinearity. In addition, in every
dimension we establish a higher integrability result for the gradient and
optimal integrability results for the solution in Morrey spaces.
  As one can see by a series of classical examples, all our results are sharp.
Furthermore, as a corollary we obtain that extremal solutions of Gelfand
problems are $W^{1,2}$ in every dimension and they are smooth in dimension $n
\leq 9$. This answers to two famous open problems posed by Brezis and
Brezis-V\'azquez.

generated by a single object $G$ is weakly approximable if $C(G,G[i])=0$ for
$i>1$ (we say that $G$ is weakly negative if this assumption is fulfilled; the
case where the equality $C(G,G[1])=0$ is fulfilled as well was mentioned by
Neeman himself). Moreover, if $G\cong \bigoplus_{0\le i\le n}G_i$ and
$C(G_i,G_j[1])=0$ whenever $i\le j$ then $C$ is also approximable.
  The latter result can be useful since (under a few more additional
assumptions) it allows to characterize a certain explicit subcategory of $C$ as
the category of finite cohomological functors from the subcategory $C^c$ of
compact objects of $C$ into $R$-modules (for a noetherian commutative ring $R$
such that $C$ is $R$-linear). One may apply this statement to the construction
of certain adjoint functors and $t$-structures.
  Our proof of (weak) approximability of $C$ under the aforementioned
assumptions is closely related to (weight decompositions for) certain (weak)
weight structures, and we discuss this relationship in detail.

results from Geometry, mean that changes in a thin sheet's Gaussian curvature
are prohibitively expensive. As a result, an imposed curvature in one principal
direction inhibits bending in the other: so-called curvature-induced rigidity.
Here, we study the buckling behaviour of a rectangular strip of finite
thickness held horizontally in a gravitational field, but with a transverse
curvature imposed at one end. The finite thickness of the sheet limits the
efficacy of curvature-induced rigidity in two ways: (i) finite bending
stiffness acts to `uncurve' the sheet, even if this costs some stretching
energy, and (ii) for sufficiently long strips, finite weight deforms the strip
downwards, releasing some of its gravitational potential energy. We find the
critical imposed curvature required to prevent buckling (or, equivalently, to
rigidify the strip), determining the dependence on geometrical and constitutive
parameters, as well as describing the buckled shape of the strip well beyond
the threshold for buckling. In doing so, we quantify the intuitive
understanding of curvature-induced rigidity that we gain from curving the crust
of a slice of pizza to prevent it from drooping downwards as we eat.

eigencurve at a point $f$ corresponding to a weight one cuspidal theta series
irregular at the prime number $p$. We show that $f$ belongs to exactly three or
four irreducible components and study their intersection multiplicities. In
particular, we show that the congruence ideal of a CM component has a simple
zero at $f$ if and only if a certain anti-cyclotomic $\mathscr{L}$-invariant
$\mathscr{L}_-(\varphi)$ does not vanish. Further, using Roy's Strong Six
Exponential Theorem we show that at least one amongst $\mathscr{L}_-(\varphi)$
and $\mathscr{L}_-(\varphi^{-1})$ is non-zero. Combined with a divisibility
proved by Hida and Tilouine, we deduce that the anti-cyclotomic Katz $p$-adic
$L$-function of $\varphi$ has a simple (trivial) zero at $s=0$ if
$\mathscr{L}_-(\varphi)$ is non-zero, which can be seen as an anti-cyclotomic
analogue of a result of Ferrero and Greenberg. Finally, we propose a formula
for the linear term of the two-variable Katz $p$-adic $L$-function of $\varphi$
at $s=0$ extending a conjecture of Gross.

industrial areas, forest areas, rivers, lakes, etc. DL is a new paradigm for
Big Data analytics and in particular for Computer Vision. The application of DL
in images classification for land cover purposes has a great potential owing to
the high degree of automation and computing performance. In particular, the
invention of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) was a fundament for the
advancements in this field. In [1], the Satellite Task Team of the UN Global

earth observation for Official Statistics. However, in that study, CNNs have
not yet been explored for automatic classification of imagery. This work
investigates the usage of CNNs for the estimation of land cover indicators,
providing evidence of the first promising results. In particular, the paper
proposes a customized model, called Satellite-Net, able to reach an accuracy

based on Bayesian non-parametric density estimation, which bypass the need for
predefined partitions. In all cases, the Bayesian paradigm guarantees the
quantification of uncertainty in the estimation process through the posterior
distribution over the sensitivity measures, without requiring additional

signals by alternating the reconstruction process between the x-f space and
image space in an iterative fashion. This enables the network to effectively
capture useful information and jointly exploit spatio-temporal correlations
from both complementary domains. Experiments conducted on highly undersampled
short-axis cardiac cine MRI scans demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms the current state-of-the-art dynamic MR reconstruction approaches

for the presence of discrete spectrum. The results of the analysis provide the
first rigorous characterization of the nonlinear interactions between solitons
and the coherent oscillating structures produced by localized perturbations in
a modulationally unstable medium. The study makes crucial use of the inverse
scattering transform for the focusing NLS equation with nonzero boundary
conditions, as well as of the nonlinear steepest descent method of Deift and
Zhou for oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problems. Previously, it was shown that in
the absence of discrete spectrum the $xt$-plane decomposes asymptotically in
time into two types of regions: a left far-field region and a right far-field
region, where to leading order the solution equals the condition at infinity up
to a phase shift, and a central region where the asymptotic behavior is
described by slowly modulated periodic oscillations. Here, it is shown that in
the presence of a conjugate pair of discrete eigenvalues in the spectrum a
similar coherent oscillatory structure emerges but, in addition, three
different interaction outcomes can arise depending on the precise location of
the eigenvalues: (i) soliton transmission, (ii) soliton trapping, and (iii) a
mixed regime in which the soliton transmission or trapping is accompanied by
the formation of an additional, nondispersive localized structure akin to a
soliton-generated wake. The soliton-induced position and phase shifts of the
oscillatory structure are computed, and the analytical results are validated by
a set of accurate numerical simulations.

MA-peak, 500 ns current pulse to a cylindrical arrangement of parallel wires,

acceleration of the ablated wire material, and a magnetic field of several
Tesla is embedded at source by the driving current. This setup has been used
for a variety of experiments investigating the interactions of magnetized
plasma flows. In experiments designed to investigate magnetic reconnection, the
collision of counter-streaming flows, carrying oppositely directed magnetic
fields, leads to the formation of a reconnection layer in which we observe ions
reaching temperatures much greater than predicted by classical heating
mechanisms. The breakup of this layer under the plasmoid instability is
dependent on the properties of the inflowing plasma, which can be controlled by
the choice of the wire array material. In other experiments, magnetized shocks
were formed by placing obstacles in the path of the magnetized plasma flow. The
pile-up of magnetic flux in front of a conducting obstacle produces a magnetic
precursor acting on upstream electrons at the distance of the ion inertial
length. This precursor subsequently develops into a steep density transition
via ion-electron fluid decoupling. Obstacles which possess a strong private
magnetic field affect the upstream flow over a much greater distance, providing
an extended bow shock structure. In the region surrounding the obstacle the
magnetic pressure holds off the flow, forming a void of plasma material,
analogous to the magnetopause around planetary bodies with self-generated
magnetic fields.

fast, low-latency, grant-free and uncoordinated uplink for densely packed
wireless nodes. Specifically, we study random-access codes, previously
introduced for the AWGN multiple-access channel (MAC) by Polyanskiy'2017, in
the practically more relevant case of users subject to Rayleigh fading, when
channel gains are unknown to the decoder. We propose a random coding
achievability bound, which we analyze both non-asymptotically (at finite
blocklength) and asymptotically. As a candidate practical solution, we propose
an explicit sparse-graph based coding scheme together with an alternating
belief-propagation decoder. The latter's performance is found to be
surprisingly close to the finite-blocklength bounds. Our main findings are
twofold. First, just like in the AWGN MAC we see that jointly decoding large
number of users leads to a surprising phase transition effect, where at
spectral efficiencies below a critical threshold (5-15 bps/Hz depending on
reliability) a perfect multi-user interference cancellation is possible.
Second, while the presence of Rayleigh fading significantly increases the
minimal required energy-per-bit $E_b/N_0$ (from about 0-2 dB to about 8-11 dB),
the inherent randomization introduced by the channel makes it much easier to
attain the optimal performance via iterative schemes.
  In all, it is hoped that a principled definition of the random-access model
together with our information-theoretic analysis will open the road towards
unified benchmarking and comparison performance of various random-access
solutions, such as the currently discussed candidates (MUSA, SCMA, RSMA) for
the 5G/6G.

in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening networks. Through deep learning, these
datasets were used to train automatic detectors for DR and a few other frequent
pathologies, with the goal to automate screening. One challenge limits the
adoption of such systems so far: automatic detectors ignore rare conditions
that ophthalmologists currently detect, such as papilledema or anterior
ischemic optic neuropathy. The reason is that standard deep learning requires
too many examples of these conditions. However, this limitation can be
addressed with few-shot learning, a machine learning paradigm where a
classifier has to generalize to a new category not seen in training, given only
a few examples of this category. This paper presents a new few-shot learning
framework that extends convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for
frequent conditions, with an unsupervised probabilistic model for rare
condition detection. It is based on the observation that CNNs often perceive
photographs containing the same anomalies as similar, even though these CNNs
were trained to detect unrelated conditions. This observation was based on the
t-SNE visualization tool, which we decided to incorporate in our probabilistic
model. Experiments on a dataset of 164,660 screening examinations from the
OPHDIAT screening network show that 37 conditions, out of 41, can be detected
with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 (average AUC: 0.938).
In particular, this framework significantly outperforms other frameworks for
detecting rare conditions, including multitask learning, transfer learning and
Siamese networks, another few-shot learning solution. We expect these richer
predictions to trigger the adoption of automated eye pathology screening, which
will revolutionize clinical practice in ophthalmology.

of both polar and non-polar QWs are simulated within the random QW model
distinguishing contributions of individual transitions taking into account QW
inhomogeneities (QW width and indium content fluctuations). On this basis we
interpret the ER and PL spectra measured for a polar multiple QW InGaN/GaN
structure. The built-in electric field shifts the emission wavelength to red,
and enhances the broadening of optical transitions. It is clearly shown that
for polar QWs the Stokes shift can be easily overestimated if PL spectra are
compared with ER spectra since the intensity of the fundamental transition
observed in ER spectra significantly decreases with the increase in QW width.
In this way ER signal related to excited states start to dominate. This effect
is strongly enhanced by QW inhomogeneities.

lines at $J$ levels between 24 and 39; seventeen of them in the ground
vibrational state $v$=0 (9 lines corresponding to the main C isotopologue and 8
lines corresponding to the $^{13}$C isotopologues), and fourteen in the lowest
vibrationally excited state $v_7$=1. Using LTE-based population diagrams for
the beam-diluted $v$=0 transitions, we determined $T_{\rm exc}$=85$\pm$4 K and
$N$(HC$_3$N)=(6.9$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, while for the
beam-diluted $v_7$=1 transitions we obtained $T_{\rm exc}$=89$\pm$10 K and
$N$(HC$_3$N)=2$\pm$1$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. Non-LTE calculations using
H$_2$ collision rates indicate that the HC$_3$N emission is in good agreement
with LTE-based results. From the non-LTE method we estimated $T_{\rm kin}$
$\simeq$90~K, $n$(H$_2$)$\simeq$2$\times$10$^7$~cm$^{-3}$ for a central core of
6 arcsec in size. A vibrational temperature in the range from 130~K to 145~K
was also determined, values which are very likely lower limits. Our results
suggest that rotational transitions are thermalized, while IR radiative pumping
processes are probably more efficient than collisions in exciting the molecule
to the vibrationally excited state $v_7$=1. Abundance ratios derived under LTE
conditions for the $^{13}$C isotopologues suggest that the main formation
pathway of HC$_3$N is ${\rm C}_2{\rm H}_2 + {\rm CN} \rightarrow {\rm HC}_3{\rm
N} + {\rm H}$.

It is capable of fitting an arbitrary number of planets, radial velocity data
sets, astrometric data sets, and/or transits observed with any combination of
wavelengths. We model the star simultaneously in the fit and provide several
state-of-the-art ways to constrain its properties, including taking advantage
of the now-ubiquitous all-sky catalog photometry and Gaia parallaxes. EXOFASTv2
can model the star by itself, too. Multi-planet systems are modeled
self-consistently with the same underlying stellar mass that defines their
semi-major axes through Kepler's law and the planetary period. Transit timing,
duration, and depth variations can be modeled with a simple command line
option.
  We explain our methodology and rationale as well as provide an improved
version of the core transit model that is both 25\% faster and more accurate.
We highlight several potential pitfalls in exoplanet modeling, including the
handling of eccentricity in transit-only fits, that the standard exoplanet
convention for $\omega$ uses a left-handed coordinate system, contrary to most
modern textbooks, how to avoid an important degeneracy when allowing negative
companion masses, and a widely unappreciated, potential 10-minute ambiguity in
the reported transit times.
  EXOFASTv2 is available at https://github.com/jdeast/EXOFASTv2 . The code is
written in IDL, and includes an executable that can be run freely and legally
without an IDL license or any knowledge of the language. Extensive
documentation and tutorials are included in the distribution for a variety of
example fits. Advanced amateurs and undergrads have successfully performed
sophisticated global fits of complex planetary systems with EXOFASTv2. It is
therefore a powerful tool for education and outreach as well as the broader
professional community.

on-going program to map the kinematics and chemistry of stellar streams in the
Southern Hemisphere. The initial focus of ${S}^5$ has been spectroscopic
observations of recently identified streams within the footprint of the Dark
Energy Survey (DES), with the eventual goal of surveying streams across the
entire southern sky. Stellar streams are composed of material that has been
tidally striped from dwarf galaxies and globular clusters and hence are
excellent dynamical probes of the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, as
well as providing a detailed snapshot of its accretion history. Observing with
the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope's 2-degree-Field fibre positioner and
AAOmega spectrograph, and combining the precise photometry of DES DR1 with the
superb proper motions from $Gaia$ DR2, allows us to conduct an efficient
spectroscopic survey to map these stellar streams. So far ${S}^5$ has mapped 9
DES streams and 3 streams outside of DES; the former are the first
spectroscopic observations of these recently discovered streams. In addition to
the stream survey, we use spare fibres to undertake a Milky Way halo survey and
a low-redshift galaxy survey. This paper presents an overview of the ${S}^5$
program, describing the scientific motivation for the survey, target selection,
observation strategy, data reduction and survey validation. Finally, we
describe early science results on stellar streams and Milky Way halo stars
drawn from the survey. Updates on ${S}^5$, including future public data

velocity is limited to the two brightest bins and no significant difference is
found for different magnitude gaps. However, when we use relative magnitudes, a
trend appears in the brightest bin: the larger the magnitude gap, the larger
the velocity segregation. We also show that this trend is mainly due to the
presence, in the brightest bin, of satellite galaxies in systems with small
magnitude gaps: in fact, if we study separately central galaxies and
satellites, this trend is mitigated and central galaxies are more segregated
than satellites for any magnitude gap. A similar result is found in the radial
velocity dispersion profiles: a trend is visible in central regions (where the
BCGs dominate) but, if we analyse the profile using satellites alone, the trend
disappears. In the latter case, the shape of the velocity dispersion profile in

lensing data. Since the quantity and quality of lensing data is constantly

against changes in the data. We address this question using free-form Grale,
which takes only image information as input, and nothing pertaining to cluster

the Hubble Frontier Fields community. Our first and second reconstructions use
55 and 91 images, respectively, and only 10 of the 91 images have the same

mass maps shows that Grale uncertainties are robust against these changes, as
well as small modifications in the inversion routine. Additionally, applying
the methods used in Sebesta et al. (2016) for MACS J0416, we conclude that, in
a statistical sense, light follows mass in Abell 2744, with brighter galaxies
clustering stronger with the recovered mass than the fainter ones. We also show

extracting its isomorphic features via the graph matching between input graph
and templates. IsoNN has two main components: graph isomorphic feature
extraction component and classification component. The graph isomorphic feature
extraction component utilizes a set of subgraph templates as the kernel
variables to learn the possible subgraph patterns existing in the input graph
and then computes the isomorphic features. A set of permutation matrices is
used in the component to break the node-order brought by the matrix
representation. Three fully-connected layers are used as the classification
component in IsoNN. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets,
the experimental results can demonstrate the effectiveness of ISONN, especially
compared with both classic and state-of-the-art graph classification methods.

forest indicate a mild preference for a deviation from a power law primordial
matter power spectrum (a so-called negative `running'). We use an extension to
the BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to explore the
effects that a running scalar spectral index has on large-scale structure
(LSS), using Planck CMB constraints to initialize the simulations. We focus on
5 key statistics: i) the non-linear matter power spectrum ii) the halo mass
function; iii) the halo two-point auto correlation function; iv) total mass
halo density profiles; and v) the halo concentration-mass relation. In terms of
the matter power spectrum, we find that a running scalar spectral index affects
all k-scales examined in this study, with a negative (positive) running leading
to an amplification (suppression) of power. These effects should be easily
detectable with upcoming surveys such as LSST and Euclid. In the mass range
sampled, a positive running leads to an increase in the mass of galaxy groups
and clusters, with the favoured negative running leading to a decrease in mass
of lower-mass (M <~ 10^13 M_solar) halos, but an increase for the most massive
(M >~ 10^13 M_solar) halos. Changes in the mass are generally confined to 5-10%
which, while not insignificant, cannot by itself reconcile the claimed tension
between the primary CMB and cluster number counts. We find that running does
not significantly affect the shapes of density profiles of matched halos,
changing only their amplitude. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed
effects on LSS due to a running scalar spectral index are separable from those
of baryonic effects to typically a few percent precision.

fermions to induce lepton number violating interactions. We show that these new
particles also generate observable neutrino nonstandard interactions (NSI) with
matter. We classify radiative models as type-I or II, with type-I models
containing at least one Standard Model (SM) particle inside the loop diagram
generating neutrino mass, and type-II models having no SM particle inside the
loop. While type-II radiative models do not generate tree-level NSI, popular
models which fall under the type-I category are shown, somewhat surprisingly,
to generate observable NSI at tree-level, while being consistent with direct
and indirect constraints from colliders, electroweak precision data and
charged-lepton flavor violation (cLFV). We survey such models where neutrino
masses arise at one, two and three loops. In the prototypical Zee model which
generates neutrino masses via one-loop diagrams involving charged scalars, we
find that diagonal NSI can be as large as ($8\%, 3.8\%, 9.3\%$) for
($\varepsilon_{ee},\varepsilon_{\mu \mu}, \varepsilon_{\tau \tau}$), while
off-diagonal NSI can be at most ($10^{-3}\%, 0.56\%, 0.34\%$) for
($\varepsilon_{e\mu},\varepsilon_{e \tau}, \varepsilon_{\mu \tau}$). In
one-loop neutrino mass models using leptoquarks (LQs),
$(\varepsilon_{\mu\mu},\, \varepsilon_{\tau\tau})$ can be as large as
$(21.6\%,\,51.7\%)$, while $\varepsilon_{ee}$ and $(\varepsilon_{e\mu},\,
\varepsilon_{e\tau},\,\varepsilon_{\mu\tau})$ can at most be 0.6\%. The most
stringent constraints on the diagonal NSI are found to come from neutrino
oscillation and scattering experiments, while the off-diagonal NSI are mostly
constrained by low-energy processes, such as atomic parity violation and cLFV.
While our analysis is focused on radiative neutrino mass models, it essentially
covers all NSI possibilities with heavy mediators.

shown that large, horizontally-aligned films can be created out of
post-processed SWCNT solutions. Here, we use machine-vision automation and
parallelization to simultaneously produce globally-aligned SWCNT films using
pressure-driven filtration. Feedback control enables filtration to occur with a
constant flow rate that not only improves the nematic ordering of the SWCNT
films, but also provides the ability to align a wide range of SWCNT types and
on a variety of nanoporous membranes using the same filtration parameters.
Using polarized optical spectroscopic techniques, we show that meniscus combing
produces a two-dimensional radial SWCNT alignment on one side of the film.
After we flatten the meniscus through silanation, spatially-resolved nematicity
maps on both sides of the SWCNT film reveal global alignment across the entire
structure. From experiments changing ionic strength and membrane tribocharging,
we provide evidence that the SWCNT alignment mechanism stems from an interplay
of intertube interactions and ordered membrane charging. This work opens up the
possibility of creating globally-aligned SWCNT film structures for a
new-generation of nanotube electronics and optical control elements.

applications, various methods have been exploited for processing medical images
solar. The method of segmentation is used to analyze anal to miscall structures

Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) segmentation via a novel algorithm based on
genetic and regional growth. Methods: Among medical imaging methods, brains MRI
segmentation is important due to the high contrast of non-intrusive soft tissue
and high spatial resolution. Size variations of brain tissues are often
accompanied by various diseases such as Alzheimers disease. As our knowledge
about the relationship between various brain diseases and deviation of brain
anatomy increases, MRI segmentation is exploited as the first step in early
diagnosis. In this paper, the regional growth method and auto-mate selection of
initial points by genetic algorithm are used to introduce a new method for MRI
segmentation. Primary pixels and similarity criterion are automatically by
genetic algorithms to maximize the accuracy and validity in image segmentation.
Results: By using genetic algorithms and defining the fixed function of image
segmentation, the initial points for the algorithm were found. The proposed
algorithms are applied to the images and results are manually selected by
regional growth in which the initial points were compared. The results showed
that the proposed algorithm could reduce segmentation error effectively.
Conclusion: The study concluded that the proposed algorithm could reduce
segmentation error effectively and help us to diagnose brain diseases.

instead of the joint probability density function. We hence obtain a family of
BLBs, which is shown to form a counterpart at least as tight as the well-known

parameter estimation. Conditions for equality between these two families are
provided. Focusing on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB), a definition of
efficiency is proposed relatively to its tighter form, and efficient estimators
are described for various types of common estimation problems, e.g., scalar,
exponential family model parameter estimation. Finally, an example is provided,
for which the classical BCRB is known to not be tight, while we show its
tighter form is, based on formal proofs of asymptotic efficiency of Bayesian

the vanishing of symplectic cohomology and the existence of symplectic
dilations are properties independent of the filling for ADC manifolds. Using
them, various topological applications on symplectic fillings are obtained,
including the uniqueness of diffeomorphism types of fillings for many contact
manifolds. We use the structure maps to define the first symplectic
obstructions to Weinstein fillability. In particular, we show that for all
dimension $4k+3, k\ge 1$, there exist infinitely many contact manifolds that
are exactly fillable, almost Weinstein fillable but not Weinstein fillable. The
invariance of the structure maps generalizes to strong fillings with vanishing
first Chern class. We show that any strong filling with vanishing first Chern
class of a class of manifolds, including $(S^{2n-1},\xi_{std}), \partial(T^*L
\times \mathbb{C}^n)$ with $L$ simply connected, must be exact and have unique
diffeomorphism type. As an application of the proof, we show that the existence

supervised model learning with a large set of cross-view identity labelled
training data. Even worse, such trained models are limited to only the
same-domain deployment with significantly degraded cross-domain generalization
capability, i.e. ""domain specific"". To solve this limitation, there are a
number of recent unsupervised domain adaptation and unsupervised learning
methods that leverage unlabelled target domain training data. However, these
methods need to train a separate model for each target domain as supervised
learning methods. This conventional ""{\em train once, run once}"" pattern is
unscalable to a large number of target domains typically encountered in
real-world deployments. We address this problem by presenting a ""train once,
run everywhere"" pattern industry-scale systems are desperate for. We formulate
a ""universal model learning' approach enabling domain-generic person re-id
using only limited training data of a ""{\em single}"" seed domain. Specifically,
we train a universal re-id deep model to discriminate between a set of
transformed person identity classes. Each of such classes is formed by applying
a variety of random appearance transformations to the images of that class,
where the transformations simulate the camera viewing conditions of any domains

methods such as density functional theory (DFT), because of the crucial role
played by London dispersion forces and non-covalent interactions in general.
Recent efforts have established reference quality interactions of several
carbon nanostructures interacting with water. Here, we compile a new benchmark
set (dubbed \textbf{WaC18}), which includes a single water molecule interacting
with a broad range of carbon structures, and various bulk (3D) and two
dimensional (2D) ice polymorphs. The performance of 28 approaches, including
semi-local exchange-correlation functionals, non-local (Fock) exchange
contributions, and long-range van der Waals (vdW) treatments, are tested by
computing the deviations from the reference interaction energies. The
calculated mean absolute deviations on the WaC18 set depends crucially on the
DFT approach, ranging from 135 meV for LDA to 12 meV for PBE0-D4. We find that
modern vdW corrections to DFT significantly improve over their precursors.

is the use of flag qubits. We modify minimum weight perfect matching decoding
to efficiently and scalably incorporate information from measurements of the

advantage of distributed computing to reduce the wall-clock time of MD
simulation via parallelization with respect to MD timesteps. The marginal
distribution for the time evolution of a system is expressed in terms of a path
integral, enabling the use of path sampling techniques to numerically integrate
MD trajectories. By parallelizing the evaluation of the path action with
respect to time and by initializing the path configurations from a
non-equilibrium distribution, the algorithm enables significant speedups in
terms of the length of MD trajectories that can be integrated in a given amount
of wall-clock time. The method is demonstrated for Brownian dynamics, although
it is generalizable to other stochastic equations of motion including open
systems. We apply the method to two simple systems, a harmonic oscillator and a
Lennard-Jones liquid, and we show that in comparison to the conventional Euler
integration scheme for Brownian dynamics, the new method can reduce the
wall-clock time for integrating trajectories of a given length by more than
three orders of magnitude in the former system and more than two in the latter.
This new method for parallelizing MD in the dimension of time can be trivially
combined with algorithms for parallelizing the MD force evaluation to achieve
further speedup.

relation to motor skill, instead of learning performance as broadly studied. We
empirically approach this problem by conducting a three-dimensional physical
space visuomotor learning experiment during electroencephalographic (EEG) data
recordings with thirty-seven healthy participants. We demonstrate that
across-subjects variations in average movement smoothness as the quantified
measure of subjects' motor skills can be predicted from the global
configuration of resting-state EEG alpha-rhythms (8-14 Hz) recorded prior to
the experiment. Importantly, this neural signature of motor skill was found to
be orthogonal to (independent of) task -- as well as to learning-related
changes in alpha-rhythms, which we interpret as an organizing principle of the

Poisson-Voronoi (PV) cell. While these worst-case elevation angles are
correlated for neighboring BSs due to the structure of the PV tessellation, it
does not explicitly appear in our analysis because of our focus on the average
interference. We also provide an estimate of the nominal average interference
by approximating each cell as a circle with area equal to the average area of
the typical cell. Using these results, we demonstrate that the gap between the
two results remains approximately constant with respect to the exclusion zone
radius. Our analysis reveals useful trends in average interference power, as a
function of key deployment parameters such as radar/BS antenna heights, number
of antenna elements per radar/BS, BS density, and exclusion zone radius.

diseases, however, can provide patients and carers with the chance of early
intervention, better disease management, and efficient allocation of healthcare

learning) provides a great opportunity to address this unmet need. In this
study, we introduce BEHRT: A deep neural sequence transduction model for EHR

trajectory mapping. When trained and evaluated on the data from nearly 1.6
million individuals, BEHRT shows a striking absolute improvement of 8.0-10.8%,
in terms of Average Precision Score, compared to the existing state-of-the-art
deep EHR models (in terms of average precision, when predicting for the onset
of 301 conditions). In addition to its superior prediction power, BEHRT
provides a personalised view of disease trajectories through its attention
mechanism; its flexible architecture enables it to incorporate multiple
heterogeneous concepts (e.g., diagnosis, medication, measurements, and more) to
improve the accuracy of its predictions; and its (pre-)training results in
disease and patient representations that can help us get a step closer to

well in practice. Classical tuning strategies decay the step size polynomially
and lead to optimal sublinear rates on (strongly) convex problems. An
alternative schedule, popular in nonconvex optimization, is called
\emph{geometric step decay} and proceeds by halving the step size after every
few epochs. In recent work, geometric step decay was shown to improve
exponentially upon classical sublinear rates for the class of \emph{sharp}
convex functions. In this work, we ask whether geometric step decay similarly
improves stochastic algorithms for the class of sharp nonconvex problems. Such
losses feature in modern statistical recovery problems and lead to a new
challenge not present in the convex setting: the region of convergence is
local, so one must bound the probability of escape. Our main result shows that
for a large class of stochastic, sharp, nonsmooth, and nonconvex problems a
geometric step decay schedule endows well-known algorithms with a local linear
rate of convergence to global minimizers. This guarantee applies to the
stochastic projected subgradient, proximal point, and prox-linear algorithms.
As an application of our main result, we analyze two statistical recovery
tasks---phase retrieval and blind deconvolution---and match the best known
guarantees under Gaussian measurement models and establish new guarantees under

Most often, the latent space is constrained to a partitioned representation or

of a latent representation based on a product space of Orthogonal Spheres
PrOSe. The PrOSe model is motivated by the reasoning that latent-variables
related to the physics of image-formation can under certain relaxed assumptions
lead to spherical-spaces. Orthogonality between the spheres is motivated via
physical independence models. Imposing the orthogonal-sphere constraint is much
simpler than other complicated physical models, is fairly general and flexible,
and extensible beyond the factors used to motivate its development. Under
further relaxed assumptions of equal-sized latent blocks per factor, the
constraint can be written down in closed form as an ortho-normality term in the
loss function. We show that our approach improves the quality of

purely declarative language with comparatively high modeling capabilities.
Indeed, ASP can model problems in NP in a compact and elegant way. However,
modeling problems beyond NP with ASP is known to be complicated, on the one
hand, and limited to problems in {\Sigma}^P_2 on the other. Inspired by the way
Quantified Boolean Formulas extend SAT formulas to model problems beyond NP, we
propose an extension of ASP that introduces quantifiers over stable models of
programs. We name the new language ASP with Quantifiers (ASP(Q)). In the paper
we identify computational properties of ASP(Q); we highlight its modeling
capabilities by reporting natural encodings of several complex problems with
applications in artificial intelligence and number theory; and we compare
ASP(Q) with related languages. Arguably, ASP(Q) allows one to model problems in
the Polynomial Hierarchy in a direct way, providing an elegant expansion of ASP
beyond the class NP. Under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

be a weakness in many other cases, and especially for query answering.
Paracoherent answer set semantics extend the classical semantics of ASP to draw
meaningful conclusions also from incoherent programs, with the result of
increasing the range of applications of ASP. State of the art implementations
of paracoherent ASP adopt the semi-equilibrium semantics, but cannot be lifted
straightforwardly to compute efficiently the (better) split semi-equilibrium
semantics that discards undesirable semi-equilibrium models. In this paper an
efficient evaluation technique for computing a split semi-equilibrium model is

datasets are large and have to be stored on different machines. Often we deal
with minimizing the average of a set of convex functions where each function is
the empirical risk of the corresponding part of the data. In the distributed

machines, there would be a series of rounds of local computations followed by
some communication among the machines. Since the cost of the communication is
usually higher than the local machine computations, it is important to reduce
it as much as possible. However, we should not allow this to make the
computation too expensive to become a burden in practice. Using second-order
methods could make the algorithms converge faster and decrease the amount of
communication needed. There are some successful attempts in developing
distributed second-order methods. Although these methods have shown fast
convergence, their local computation is expensive and could enjoy more
improvement for practical uses. In this study we modify an existing approach,
DANE (Distributed Approximate NEwton), in order to improve the computational
cost while maintaining the accuracy. We tackle this problem by using iterative
methods for solving the local subproblems approximately instead of providing
exact solutions for each round of communication. We study how using different
iterative methods affect the behavior of the algorithm and try to provide an
appropriate tradeoff between the amount of local computation and the required

horizontal branch of Galactic globular clusters mainly depends on the metal
content. However, the existence of globular clusters with similar metal content
and absolute age but different horizontal branch morphologies, suggests the
presence of another parameter affecting the star distribution along the branch.
To investigate the variation of the horizontal branch morphology in Galactic
globular clusters, we define a new photometric horizontal branch morphology
index, overcoming some of the limitations and degeneracies affecting similar
indices available in the literature. We took advantage of a sample of 64
Galactic globular clusters, with both space-based imaging data and homogeneous
ground-based photometric catalogues in five different bands ($U$,$B$,$V$, $R$,
$I$). The new index, $\tau_{HB}$, is defined as the ratio between the areas
subtended by the cumulative number distribution in magnitude ($I$) and in
colour ($V-I$) of all stars along the horizontal branch. This new index shows a
linear trend over the entire range in metallicity (-2.35 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$
-0.12) covered by our Galactic globular cluster sample. We found a linear
relation between $\tau_{HB}$ and absolute cluster ages. We also found a
quadratic anti-correlation with [Fe/H], becoming linear when we eliminate the
age effect on $\tau_{HB}$ values. Moreover, we identified a subsample of eight
clusters that are peculiar according to their $\tau_{HB}$ values. These
clusters have bluer horizontal branch morphology when compared to typical ones
of similar metallicity. These findings allow us to define them as the 'second
parameter' clusters in the sample. A comparison with synthetic horizontal
branch models suggests that they cannot be entirely explained with a spread in
helium content.

also short-range entangled, it is possible that the reduced density matrix
remains low-entangled throughout thermalization; or there could exist a barrier
with high operator entanglement between the initial and thermalized reduced
density matrix. In this paper, we study such dynamics in three classes of
models: the rational CFTs, the random unitary circuit, and the holographic
CFTs, representing systems of increasing quantum chaoticity. We show that in
all three classes of models, the operator entanglement (or variant of) exhibits
three phases, a linear growth phase, a plateau phase, and a decay phase. The
plateau phase characterized by volume-law operator entanglement corresponds to
the barrier in operator entanglement. While it is present in all three models,
its persistence and exit show interesting distinctions among them. The rational
CFTs have the shortest plateau phase, followed by the slowest decay phase; the
holographic CFTs mark the opposite end, i.e. having the longest plateau phase
followed by a discontinuous drop; and the random unitary circuit shows the
intermediate behavior. We discuss the mechanisms underlying these behaviors in
operator entanglement barriers, whose persistence might serve as another
measure for quantum chaoticity.

probability $1/n$ at the $n$th trial. Arratia, Barbour and Tavar\'e (1992)
extended Feller's coupling, to associate cycles of random permutations governed
by the Ewens $(\theta)$ distribution with spacings derived from independent
Bernoulli trials with success probability $\theta/(n-1+\theta)$ at the $n$th

indicators of record values in a sequence of i.i.d. uniform $[0,1]$ variables.
In the present article, the Poisson property of inhomogeneous Bernoulli

a useful but less studied problem setting. Conventional clustering approaches,
which based on ""Min-Cut""-style criteria, compress both the vertices and edges
of the graph into the communities, that lead to a loss of directed edge
information. On the other hand, compressing the vertices while preserving the
directed edge information provides a way to learn the small-scale
representation of a directed graph. The reconstruction error, which measures
the edge information preserved by the summarized graph, can be used to learn
such representation. Compared to the original graphs, the summarized graphs are
easier to analyze and are capable of extracting group-level features which is
useful for efficient interventions of population behavior. In this paper, we
present a model, based on minimizing reconstruction error with non-negative
constraints, which relates to a ""Max-Cut"" criterion that simultaneously
identifies the compressed nodes and the directed compressed relations between
these nodes. A multiplicative update algorithm with column-wise normalization
is proposed. We further provide theoretical results on the identifiability of
the model and on the convergence of the proposed algorithms. Experiments are

capacity, bulk modulus, thermal expansivity, chemical potentials) and seismic

cost of a large labeled data set. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a
promising solution by leveraging the structure of unlabeled data to improve
learning from a small set of labeled data. Self-ensembling is a simple approach
used in SSL to encourage consensus among ensemble predictions of unknown
labels, improving generalization of the model by making it more insensitive to
the latent space. Currently, such an ensemble is obtained by randomization such
as dropout regularization and random data augmentation. In this work, we
hypothesize -- from the generalization perspective -- that self-ensembling can
be improved by exploiting the stochasticity of a disentangled latent space. To
this end, we present a stacked SSL model that utilizes unsupervised
disentangled representation learning as the stochastic embedding for
self-ensembling. We evaluate the presented model for multi-label classification
using chest X-ray images, demonstrating its improved performance over related
SSL models as well as the interpretability of its disentangled representations.

perform coverage analyses and cross-model checks to validate its ability to

objects in new ways to act on the world, achieve a goal, or solve a problem. To
study this type of general physical problem solving, we introduce the Virtual
Tools game. In this game, people solve a large range of challenging physical
puzzles in just a handful of attempts. We propose that the flexibility of human
physical problem solving rests on an ability to imagine the effects of
hypothesized actions, while the efficiency of human search arises from rich
action priors which are updated via observations of the world. We instantiate
these components in the ""Sample, Simulate, Update"" (SSUP) model and show that
it captures human performance across 30 levels of the Virtual Tools game. More
broadly, this model provides a mechanism for explaining how people condense
general physical knowledge into actionable, task-specific plans to achieve
flexible and efficient physical problem-solving.

with frequency-dependent full transport in stationary spacetimes. This method
is stable and accurate for both large and small optical depths and radiation
pressures. The radiation stress-energy tensor is evolved in flux-conservative
form, and closed with a swarm of samples that each transport a multigroup
representation of the invariant specific intensity along a null geodesic. In
each zone, the enclosed samples are used to efficiently construct a Delaunay
triangulation of the unit sphere in the comoving frame, which in turn is used
to calculate the Eddington tensor, average source terms, and adaptively refine
the sample swarm. Radiation four-fources are evaluated in the moment sector in
a semi-implicit fashion. The radiative transfer equation is solved in invariant
form deterministically for each sample. Since each sample carries a discrete
representation of the full spectrum, the cost of evaluating the transport
operator is independent of the number of frequency groups, representing a
significant reduction of algorithmic complexity for transport in frequency
dependent problems. The major approximation we make in this work is performing
scattering in an angle-averaged way, with Compton scattering further
approximated by the Kompaneets equation. Local adaptivity in samples also makes
this scheme more amenable to nonuniform meshes than a traditional Monte Carlo
method. We describe the method and present results on a suite of test problems.
We find that MOCMC converges at least as $\sim N^{-1}$, rather than the
canonical Monte Carlo $N^{-1/2}$, where $N$ is the number of samples per zone.
On several problems we demonstrate substantial improvement over Eddington and

  arXiv:1903.12492",,"10.1093/mnras/stz2390",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recently discovered resonant drag instability (RDI) of dust streaming in
protoplanetary disc is considered as the mode coupling of subsonic gas-dust
mixture perturbations. This mode coupling is coalescence of two modes with
nearly equal phase velocities: inertial wave (IW) having positive energy and a
streaming dust wave (SDW) having negative energy as measured in the frame of
gas environment being at rest in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. SDW is a
trivial mode produced by the bulk streaming of dust, which transports
perturbations of dust density. In this way, settling combined with radial drift
of the dust makes possible coupling of SDW with IW and the onset of the
instability. In accordance with the concept of the mode coupling, RDI growth
rate is proportional to the square root of the coupling term of the dispersion
equation, which itself is proportional to mass fraction of dust, $f\ll 1$. This
clarifies why RDI growth rate $\propto f^{1/2}$. When SDW has positive energy,
its resonance with IW provides an avoided crossing instead of the mode
coupling. In the high wavenumber limit RDI with unbounded growth rate $\propto
f^{1/3}$ is explained by the triple mode coupling, which is coupling of SDW
with two IW. It coexists with a new quasi-resonant instability accompanied by
bonding of two oppositely propagating low-frequency IW. The mode coupling does
not exist for dust streaming only radially in a disc. In this case RDI is
provided by the obscured mechanism associated with the inertia of solids.

It also introduces a body force term in the governing equations to account for
friction loss along the pore boundaries. The source term depends on the
thickness of the porous wall and the concept of an equivalent single pore. The
feasibility of the latter concept is demonstrated using low-speed permeability

but their determination has become controversial. Methods: In this paper
parametric, non-parametric and robust reference intervals with Tukey and block
elimination are calculated from a dataset of over 32,000 serum immunoglobulin A
(IgA) measurements. Results: The outlier elimination method was significantly
more determinative of the reference intervals than the calculation method. The
Tukey elimination procedure consistently eliminated significantly more values
than the block method of Dixon and Reed across all age ranges. If Tukey
elimination was applied, variation between reference intervals produced by the
different calculation methods was minimal. Block elimination rarely eliminated
values. The non-parametric reference intervals were more sensitive to outliers,
which in the IgA context, led to higher and wider reference intervals for the
older age groups. There were only minimal differences between robust and
parametric reference intervals. Conclusions: This suggests that Tukey
elimination should be preferred over the block D/R method for datasets similar
to the one used in this study. These are predominantly new observations, as
previous literature has focused on the calculation technique and not discussed
outlier elimination. This suggests the robust method is not advantageous over
the parametric method and therefore due to its complexity is not particularly
useful, contrary to CLSI Guidelines.

  to Pay for Features of Shared Automated Vehicle Services",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we contrast parametric and semi-parametric representations of
unobserved heterogeneity in hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logit models and
leverage these methods to infer distributions of willingness to pay for
features of shared automated vehicle (SAV) services. Specifically, we compare
the multivariate normal (MVN), finite mixture of normals (F-MON) and Dirichlet
process mixture of normals (DP-MON) mixing distributions. The latter promises
to be particularly flexible in respect to the shapes it can assume and unlike
other semi-parametric approaches does not require that its complexity is fixed
prior to estimation. However, its properties relative to simpler mixing
distributions are not well understood. In this paper, we evaluate the
performance of the MVN, F-MON and DP-MON mixing distributions using simulated
data and real data sourced from a stated choice study on preferences for SAV
services in New York City. Our analysis shows that the DP-MON mixing
distribution provides superior fit to the data and performs at least as well as
the competing methods at out-of-sample prediction. The DP-MON mixing
distribution also offers substantive behavioural insights into the adoption of
SAVs. We find that preferences for in-vehicle travel time by SAV with
ride-splitting are strongly polarised. Whereas one third of the sample is
willing to pay between 10 and 80 USD/h to avoid sharing a vehicle with
strangers, the remainder of the sample is either indifferent to ride-splitting
or even desires it. Moreover, we estimate that new technologies such as vehicle
automation and electrification are relatively unimportant to travellers. This
suggests that travellers may primarily derive indirect, rather than immediate
benefits from these new technologies through increases in operational
efficiency and lower operating costs.

by multiple low-resolution cameras. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
novel end-to-end learning-based approach, which can comprehensively utilize the
specific characteristics of the input from two complementary and parallel
perspectives. Specifically, one module regresses a spatially consistent
intermediate estimation by learning a deep multidimensional and cross-domain
feature representation; the other one constructs another intermediate
estimation, which maintains the high-frequency textures, by propagating the
information of the high-resolution view. We finally leverage the advantages of
the two intermediate estimations via the learned attention maps, leading to the
final high-resolution LF image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones. That is,
our method not only improves the PSNR by more than 2 dB, but also preserves the
LF structure much better. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end deep learning method for reconstructing a high-resolution LF image
with a hybrid input. We believe our framework could potentially decrease the
cost of high-resolution LF data acquisition and also be beneficial to LF data

demi\-ma\-troids are the appropriate combinatorial objects for studying Wei's

$W(x,y,t)$, as a generalization of the extended Hamming weight enumerator of a
matroid. The polynomial $W(x,y,t)$ is a specialization of the Tutte polynomial
of $M$, and actually is equivalent to it. Guided by work of Johnsen, Roksvold

elongations determine the Hamming polynomial. Our results may be applied to
simplicial complexes since in a canonical way they can be viewed as
demimatroids. Furthermore, following work of Brylawski and Gordon, we show how
demimatroids may be generalized one step further, to combinatroids. A
combinatroid, or Brylawski structure, is an integer valued function $\rho$,
defined over the power set of a finite ground set, satisfying the only
condition $\rho(\emptyset)=0$. Even in this extreme generality, we will show
that many concepts and invariants in coding theory can be carried on directly

The proposed model accounts for the dynamicity of the network, including

24-hour intelligent surveillance system, the visible cameras may be
noneffective at night. In this situation, thermal cameras are the best
supplemental components, which capture images without depending on visible

cross-modality person re-identification (VT Re-ID) problem. In VT Re-ID, there
are two knotty problems should be well handled, cross-modality discrepancy and
intra-modality variations. To address these two issues, we propose focusing on
enhancing the discriminative feature learning (EDFL) with two extreme simple
means from two core aspects, (1) skip-connection for mid-level features
incorporation to improve the person features with more discriminability and
robustness, and (2) dual-modality triplet loss to guide the training procedures
by simultaneously considering the cross-modality discrepancy and intra-modality
variations. Additionally, the two-stream CNN structure is adopted to learn the
multi-modality sharable person features. The experimental results on two

state-of-the-art methods by large margins, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our EDFL to enhance the discriminative feature learning for VT Re-ID.

These functions satisfy a functional equation of the form $\phi(a_k x+b_k)=c_k

intractable, substantial advancements have been achieved in developing
approximate POMDP solvers in the past two decades. However, computing robust
solutions for systems with complex dynamics remain challenging. Most on-line
solvers rely on a large number of forward-simulations and standard Monte-Carlo

systems with complex dynamics, e.g., those with non-linear dynamics that admit
no closed form solution, even a single forward simulation can be prohibitively

horizons. This paper aims to alleviate the above difficulty. To this end, we

electronic correlation as well as spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and usually behave
as moderately correlated metals. A recent publication (Phys. Rev. B 95,
245121(2017)) on epitaxial SrRhO$_3$ thin films unexpectedly reported a
bad-metallic behavior and suggested the occurrence of antiferromagnetism below
100 K. We studied this SrRhO$_3$ thin film by hard x-ray photoemission
spectroscopy and found a very small density of states (DOS) at Fermi level,
which is consistent with the reported bad-metallic behavior. However, this
negligible DOS persists up to room temperature, which contradicts with the
explanation of antiferromagnetic transition at around 100 K. We also employed
electronic structure calculations within the framework of density functional
theory and dynamical mean-field theory. In contrast to the experimental
results, our calculations indicate metallic behavior of both bulk SrRhO$_3$ and
the SrRhO$_3$ thin film. The thin film exhibits stronger correlation effects
than the bulk, but the correlation effects are not sufficient to drive a
transition to an insulating state. The calculated uniform magnetic
susceptibility is substantially larger in the thin film than that in the bulk.
The role of SOC was also investigated and only a moderate modulation of the
electronic structure was observed. Hence SOC is not expected to play an
important role for electronic correlation in SrRhO$_3$.

autonomous driving. Often, these solutions rely on large networks that require
databases of real image samples of the problem (i.e., real world) for proper
training. The acquisition of such real-world data sets is not always possible
in the autonomous driving context, and sometimes their annotation is not
feasible (e.g., takes too long or is too expensive). Moreover, in many tasks,
there is an intrinsic data imbalance that most learning-based methods struggle
to cope with. It turns out that traffic sign detection is a problem in which
these three issues are seen altogether. In this work, we propose a novel
database generation method that requires only (i) arbitrary natural images,
i.e., requires no real image from the domain of interest, and (ii) templates of
the traffic signs, i.e., templates synthetically created to illustrate the
appearance of the category of a traffic sign. The effortlessly generated
training database is shown to be effective for the training of a deep detector
(such as Faster R-CNN) on German traffic signs, achieving 95.66% of mAP on
average. In addition, the proposed method is able to detect traffic signs with
an average precision, recall and F1-score of about 94%, 91% and 93%,

with simple data generation methods and without problem domain data for the

student neural network under the guidance of a trained teacher network. For
example, in neural network compression, a high-capacity teacher is distilled to

privileged data is distilled to train a student without access to that data.
The distillation loss determines how a teacher's knowledge is captured and
transferred to the student. In this paper, we propose a new form of knowledge
distillation loss that is inspired by the observation that semantically similar

Similarity-preserving knowledge distillation guides the training of a student
network such that input pairs that produce similar (dissimilar) activations in
the teacher network produce similar (dissimilar) activations in the student
network. In contrast to previous distillation methods, the student is not
required to mimic the representation space of the teacher, but rather to
preserve the pairwise similarities in its own representation space. Experiments

2 from 2006 to 2017 over the entire planet, producing a 25-40% change in the
low latitude solar heating rate according to our radiative transfer
calculations. Thus, the cloud top level atmosphere should have experienced
considerable solar heating variations over this period. Our global circulation

observed variations of zonal wind from 2006 to 2017. Overlaps in the timescale
of the long-term UV albedo and the solar activity variations make it plausible
that solar extreme UV intensity and cosmic-ray variations influenced the

possible terms in the Lagrangian up to scaling dimension four. We first clarify
the number, spins, and parities of all particle species around the Minkowski
background and find that some of those particle species are ghosts for generic
choices of parameters. For special choices of the parameters, on the other
hand, those would-be ghosts become infinitely heavy and thus can be removed
from the physical content of particle species. Imposing the conditions on the
coupling constants to eliminate the ghosts, we find new quadratic curvature
theories which are ghost-free around the Minkowski background for a range of
parameters. A key feature of these theories is that there exist a non-ghost
massive spin-2 particle and a non-ghost massive spin-0 particle in the graviton
propagator, as well as the massless spin-2 graviton. In the limit of the
infinite mass of the torsion, the Riemann-Cartan geometry reduces to the
Riemannian geometry and thus the physical content of particle species coincides
with that of the well-known quadratic curvature theory in the metric formalism,
i.e. a massive spin-2 ghost, a massive spin-0 particle and the massless spin-2
graviton. Ghost-freedom therefore sets, besides other constraints, an upper
bound on the mass of the torsion. In addition to the above mentioned particle
species, the ghost-free theory contains either the set of a massive spin-1 and
a massive spin-0 (Class I) or a couple of spin-1 (Class II). These additional
particle species mediate gravity sourced by the spin of matter fields.

learned task when fine-tuned to a new one is a phenomenon known as Catastrophic

preserving activations of the initial network during training with a new task;
or restricting the new network activations to remain close to the initial ones.
The latter approach falls under the denomination of lifelong learning, where
the model is updated in a way that it performs well on both old and new tasks,
without having access to the old task's training samples anymore. Recently,
approaches like pruning networks for freeing network capacity during sequential
learning of tasks have been gaining in popularity. Such approaches allow
learning small networks while making redundant parameters available for the
next tasks. The common problem encountered with these approaches is that the
pruning percentage is hard-coded, irrespective of the number of samples, of the
complexity of the learning task and of the number of classes in the dataset. We
propose a method based on Bayesian optimization to perform adaptive
compression/pruning of the network and show its effectiveness in lifelong

existing proof technique for the heavy-ball algorithms is hard due to that each
iteration of the heavy-ball algorithm consists of current and last points. It
is impossible to formulate the algorithms as iteration like xk+1= g(xk) under

transfers, the heavy-ball algorithm can be interpreted as iterations after this
mapping. Theoretically, we prove that heavy-ball gradient descent enjoys larger

dynamic symbolic execution. A key challenge in dynamic symbolic execution is
how to effectively explore the program's execution paths to achieve high code

heuristic to address this challenge, which favors exploring particular types of
paths that are most likely to maximize the final coverage. However, manually
designing a good search heuristic is nontrivial and typically ends up with
suboptimal and unstable outcomes. The goal of this paper is to overcome this
shortcoming of dynamic symbolic execution by automatically learning search
heuristics. We define a class of search heuristics, namely a parametric search
heuristic, and present an algorithm that efficiently finds an optimal heuristic
for each subject program. Experimental results with industrial-strength
symbolic execution tools (e.g., KLEE) show that our technique can successfully
generate search heuristics that significantly outperform existing
manually-crafted heuristics in terms of branch coverage and bug-finding.

bilinear trading strategy is a mini two-period active strategy whose final
capital growth factor is linear separately in each period's gross return vector

Thus, the universal bilinear portfolio asymptotically dominates the original

computer vision for years. Previous approaches mainly consider text as 1D

feat of CTC or attention based encoder-decoder framework, which is originally
designed for speech recognition. However, different from speech voices, which
are 1D signals, text instances are essentially distributed in 2D image spaces.
To adhere to and make use of the 2D nature of text for higher recognition
accuracy, we extend the vanilla CTC model to a second dimension, thus creating
2D-CTC. 2D-CTC can adaptively concentrate on most relevant features while
excluding the impact from clutters and noises in the background; It can also
naturally handle text instances with various forms (horizontal, oriented and
curved) while giving more interpretable intermediate predictions. The

success in supervised tasks, such as node classification and link prediction.
However, node attributes could be missing or incomplete, which significantly
deteriorates the performance. The task of node attribute generation aims to
generate attributes for those nodes whose attributes are completely unobserved.
This task benefits many real-world problems like profiling, node classification
and graph data augmentation. To tackle this task, we propose a deep adversarial
learning based method to generate node attributes; called node attribute neural
generator (NANG). NANG learns a unifying latent representation which is shared
by both node attributes and graph structures and can be translated to different
modalities. We thus use this latent representation as a bridge to convert
information from one modality to another. We further introduce practical
applications to quantify the performance of node attribute generation.
Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets and the
empirical results show that node attributes generated by the proposed method
are high-qualitative and beneficial to other applications. The datasets and

than the paraelectric-ferroelectric critical temperature. The flat energy
landscapes close to these PTs give rise to polarization rotation under external
stimuli, being responsible for the best piezoelectrics so far and a their huge

temperature-independent PT boundaries and often involves lead-containing
compounds. Here we report that such a bridging state is possible in thin films
of chemically simple materials such as BaTiO3. A coexistence of tetragonal,
orthorhombic and their bridging low-symmetry phases are shown to be responsible
for the continuous vertical polarization rotation, recreating a smear
in-transition state and leading to giant temperature-independent dielectric
response. These features are distinct from those of single crystals,
multi-domain crystals, ceramics or relaxor ferroelectrics, requiring a
different description. We believe that other materials can be engineered in a
similar way to form a class of ferroelectrics, in which MPB solid solutions are

2016 March 16 with the Gauribidanur Radio Spectro-Polarimeter (GRASP) in the
frequency range $\approx$\,90\,-\,50 MHz, and the Gauribidanur RadioheliograPH
(GRAPH) at two discrete frequencies, viz. 80 MHz and 53.3 MHz. Observations
around the same epoch in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and white-light show that
the above burst was associated with a flux rope structure and a coronal mass
ejection (CME), respectively. The combined height-time plot generated using
EUV, radio, and whitelight data suggest that the different observed features
(i.e. the flux rope, type II burst and the CME) are all closely associated. We
constructed an empirical model for the coronal electron density distribution
($N_{e}(r)$, where $r$ is the heliocentric distance) from the above set of
observations themselves and used it to estimate the coronal magnetic field
strength ($B$) over the range of $r$ values in which the respective events were
observed. The $B$ values are consistent with each other. They vary as
$B(r)\,=\,2.61 \times r^{-2.21}$ \textrm{G} in the range $r
\approx$\,1.1\,-\,2.2$\rm R_{\odot}$. As far as we know, similar `direct'
estimates of $B$ in the near-Sun corona without assuming a model for
$N_{e}(r)$, and by combining co-temporal set of observations in two different
regions (radio and whitelight) of the electromagnetic spectrum, have rarely
been reported. Further, the present work is a novel attempt where the
characteristics of a propagating EUV flux rope structure, considered to be the
signature of a CME close the Sun, have been used to estimate $B(r)$ in the

droplets of a certain size distribution. When spraying simple liquids, it is
known which experimental parameters determine the droplet size distribution.
For many applications however, surfactants are added, producing a hitherto
unknown effect on the droplet size distribution. Using two generic types of
spraying nozzles, we sprayed solutions of different types of aqueous
surfactants and measured the droplet size distribution of the sprays. We find
that the breakup of surfactant solutions is similar to that of pure water but
results in droplets that are on average smaller. The resulting droplet size
distribution can be well described using the predictions for simple liquids
provided that we replace the parameter of the equilibrium surface tension with
the dynamic surface tension of the surfactant solution at a surface age of 20
ms, which is the characteristic time for destabilization and breakup of a
liquid sheet. By rescaling them with the mean droplet size, the droplet size
distributions of water and sprays with different concentrations of surfactants
all collapse onto a single curve and can be well described using the compound
Gamma function found previously for pure liquids.

rationales behind the model outputs, which is essential for building trust and
supporting the domain experts to validate, critique and refine the model. We
propose ProSeNet, an interpretable and steerable deep sequence model with
natural explanations derived from case-based reasoning. The prediction is
obtained by comparing the inputs to a few prototypes, which are exemplar cases
in the problem domain. For better interpretability, we define several criteria
for constructing the prototypes, including simplicity, diversity, and sparsity
and propose the learning objective and the optimization procedure. ProSeNet
also provides a user-friendly approach to model steering: domain experts
without any knowledge on the underlying model or parameters can easily
incorporate their intuition and experience by manually refining the prototypes.
We conduct experiments on a wide range of real-world applications, including
predictive diagnostics for automobiles, ECG, and protein sequence
classification and sentiment analysis on texts. The result shows that ProSeNet
can achieve accuracy on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models. We also
evaluate the interpretability of the results with concrete case studies.
Finally, through user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we demonstrate
that the model selects high-quality prototypes which align well with human

selection and interpret model decisions. The recently proposed invertible
networks can accurately reconstruct the input from its output, and have the
potential to unravel the black-box representation. Therefore, we propose a
novel method to classify ASD and identify biomarkers for ASD using the
connectivity matrix calculated from fMRI as the input. Specifically, with
invertible networks, we explicitly determine the decision boundary and the
projection of data points onto the boundary. Like linear classifiers, the
difference between a point and its projection onto the decision boundary can be
viewed as the explanation. We then define the importance as the explanation
weighted by the gradient of prediction $w.r.t$ the input, and identify
biomarkers based on this importance measure. We perform a regression task to
further validate our biomarker selection: compared to using all edges in the
connectivity matrix, using the top 10\% important edges we generate a lower
regression error on 6 different severity scores. Our experiments show that the
invertible network is both effective at ASD classification and interpretable,
allowing for discovery of reliable biomarkers.

achieved state-of-the-art nucleus segmentation. However, the current pipeline
requires fully annotated training images, which are time consuming to create
and sometimes noisy. Importantly, nuclei often appear similar within the same
image. This similarity could be utilized to segment nuclei with only partially
labeled training examples. We propose a simple yet effective region-proposal

capture the similarities between unlabeled regions and labeled nuclei, we apply
decomposed self-attention to learned features. On the self-attention map, we
observe strong activation at the centers and edges of all nuclei, including
unlabeled nuclei. On this basis, our region-proposal module propagates partial
annotations to the whole image and proposes effective bounding boxes for the
bounding box-regression and binary mask-generation modules. Our method
effectively learns from unlabeled regions thereby improving detection
performance. We test our method with various nuclear images. When trained with
only 1/4 of the nuclei annotated, our approach retains a detection accuracy
comparable to that from training with fully annotated data. Moreover, our
method can serve as a bootstrapping step to create full annotations of

predetermined coverage and accuracy are reached. The source code is available

For pairs of two images, a variety of options is available and well-understood.
However, some applications such as dynamic imaging or serial sectioning involve
the analysis of image sequences and thus require a simultaneous and unbiased
comparison of many images. This paper proposes a new similarity measure, that
takes a global perspective and involves all images at the same time. The key
idea is to look at Schatten-q-norms of a matrix assembled from normalized
gradient fields of the image sequence. In particular, for q = 0, the measure is
minimized if the gradient information from the image sequence has a low rank.
This global perspective of the novel SqN-measure does not only allow to
register sequences from dynamic imaging, e.g. DCE-MRI, but is also a new
opportunity to simultaneously register serial sections, e.g. in histology. In
this way, an accumulation of small, local registration errors may be avoided.
First numerical experiments show very promising results for a DCE-MRI sequence
of a human kidney as well as for a set of serial sections. The global structure
of the data used for registration with SqN is preserved in all cases.

generally that a connected component of normalised stability conditions on

dealing with the large-scale datasets and the poor performance in
reconstructing samples. This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering
method by learning a shared generative latent representation that obeys a
mixture of Gaussian distributions. The motivation is based on the fact that the
multi-view data share a common latent embedding despite the diversity among the
views. Specifically, benefited from the success of the deep generative
learning, the proposed model not only can extract the nonlinear features from
the views, but render a powerful ability in capturing the correlations among
all the views. The extensive experimental results, on several datasets with
different scales, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the

the lack of explicit cross-domain pairs of instances. We consider here diverse

have multiple plausible translations. This is normally achieved by explicitly
disentangling content and style in the latent representation and sampling
different styles codes while maintaining the image content. Despite the success
of current DIT models, they are prone to suffer from bias. In this paper, we
study the problem of bias in image-to-image translation. Biased datasets may
add undesired changes (e.g. change gender or race in face images) to the output
translations as a consequence of the particular underlying visual distribution
in the target domain. In order to alleviate the effects of this problem we
propose the use of semantic constraints that enforce the preservation of
desired image properties. Our proposed model is a step towards unbiased diverse
image-to-image translation (UDIT), and results in less unwanted changes in the

neutron-rich heavy nuclei. The favorable projectile-target combinations play a
key role in experiments. As one important approach to investigate the
multinucleon transfer process, one new version of the dinuclear system (DNS)
model is developed. The improved version of the DNS model is shown in detail.
Based on deformation degree of freedom in the improved DNS model, one way of
calculating excitation energies of primary fragments is proposed. And the
remarkable improvements for describing experimental data of producing
trans-uranium nuclei is noticed. To produce trans-uranium nuclei, the
collisions of 48Ca, 136Xe, and 238U projectiles with the 238U target are
investigated within the improved DNS model. Based on the potential energy
surface, the influence of projectiles on the probabilities of transferring
neutrons and protons from the projectiles to the target are studied. One
behavior is found that the transfer probabilities strongly depend on the
projectiles in the neutron stripping process, while relatively weak projectile
dependence is noticed in the proton transferring process. The 136Xe and 238U

limited power wireless devices, each with its own dataset, build a joint model

bandwidth-limited fading multiple access channel (MAC) from the wireless
devices to the PS, and propose various techniques to implement distributed
stochastic gradient descent (DSGD). We first propose a digital DSGD (D-DSGD)
scheme, in which one device is selected opportunistically for transmission at
each iteration based on the channel conditions; the scheduled device quantizes
its gradient estimate to a finite number of bits imposed by the channel
condition, and transmits these bits to the PS in a reliable manner. Next,
motivated by the additive nature of the wireless MAC, we propose a novel analog
communication scheme, referred to as the compressed analog DSGD (CA-DSGD),
where the devices first sparsify their gradient estimates while accumulating
error, and project the resultant sparse vector into a low-dimensional vector
for bandwidth reduction. Numerical results show that D-DSGD outperforms other
digital approaches in the literature; however, in general the proposed CA-DSGD
algorithm converges faster than the D-DSGD scheme and other schemes in the
literature, and reaches a higher level of accuracy. We have observed that the
gap between the analog and digital schemes increases when the datasets of
devices are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Furthermore,
the performance of the CA-DSGD scheme is shown to be robust against imperfect
channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Overall these results show
clear advantages for the proposed analog over-the-air DSGD scheme, which
suggests that learning and communication algorithms should be designed jointly
to achieve the best end-to-end performance in machine learning applications at
the wireless edge.

introduces the temperature as a measure of tension tolerance of the network.
Based on the mean-field solution of the model, we find out that the model
undergoes a first-order phase transition from an imbalanced random state to
structural balance with a critical temperature $T_{c}$, where in the case of $T

first-order phase transition is the occurrence of a hysteresis loop crossing

The TESS and PLATO missions are expected to find vast numbers of new
transiting planet candidates. However, only a fraction of these candidates will
be legitimate planets, and the candidate validation will require a significant
amount of follow-up resources. Radial velocity follow-up can be carried out
only for the most promising candidates around bright, slowly rotating, stars.
Thus, before devoting RV resources to candidates, they need to be vetted using
cheaper methods, and, in the cases for which an RV confirmation is not
feasible, the candidate's true nature needs to be determined based on these
alternative methods alone.
  Aims. We study the applicability of multicolour transit photometry in the
validation of transiting planet candidates when the candidate signal arises
from a real astrophysical source. We seek to answer how securely can we
estimate the true uncontaminated star-planet radius ratio when the light curve
may contain contamination from unresolved light sources inside the photometry
aperture when combining multicolour transit observations with a physics-based
contamination model.
  Methods. The study is based on simulations and ground-based transit
observations. The analyses are carried out with a contamination model
integrated into the PyTransit v2 transit modelling package, and the
observations are carried out with the MuSCAT2 multicolour imager installed in
the 1.5 m TCS in the Teide Observatory.
  Results. We show that multicolour transit photometry can be used to estimate
the amount of flux contamination and the true radius ratio. Combining the true
radius ratio with an estimate for the stellar radius yields the true absolute
radius of the transiting object, which is a valuable quantity in statistical
candidate validation, and enough in itself to validate a candidate whose radius
falls below the theoretical lower limit for a brown dwarf.

is in a tight 3.1 hr orbit around a very low mass ($0.023 \leq m_c \lesssim
0.053$ M$_\odot$, 90\% c.l.) companion. Our 1.4 GHz observations reveal the
presence of eclipses of the pulsar's radio signal caused by the outflow of
material from the companion, for a few minutes around superior conjunction of
the pulsar. The very low companion mass, the observation of radio eclipses, and
the detection of time variations of the orbital period establish PSR J2055+3829
as a `black widow' (BW) pulsar. Inspection of the radio signal from the pulsar
during ingress and egress phases shows that the eclipses in PSR J2055+3829 are
asymmetric and variable, as is commonly observed in other similar systems. More
generally, the orbital properties of the new pulsar are found to be very
similar to those of other known eclipsing BW pulsars. No gamma-ray source is
detected at the location of the pulsar in recent \textit{Fermi}-LAT source
catalogs. We used the timing ephemeris to search ten years of \textit{Fermi}
Large Area Telescope (LAT) data for gamma-ray pulsations, but were unable to
detect any, possibly because of the pulsar's large distance. We finally
compared the mass functions of eclipsing and non-eclipsing BW pulsars and
confirmed previous findings that eclipsing BWs have higher mass functions than
their non-eclipsing counterparts. Larger inclinations could explain the higher
mass functions of eclipsing BWs. On the other hand, the mass function
distributions of Galactic disk and globular cluster BWs appear to be
consistent, suggesting, despite the very different environments, the existence
of common mechanisms taking place in the last stages of evolution of BWs.

depending on temperature, density, and photon energy, that scales with ion
charge Z. It is evaluated numerically for the full parameter space, which
requires different representations of the hypergeometric functions involved.
The results are valid for photon frequencies larger than the plasma frequency

equivalently the square of the initial Alfv\'enic Mach number
$\mathcal{M}^2_{\rm A0}$. This implies that the transition value $\Sigma_{\rm

compression of a magnetic cloud. Physically, the value of $\Sigma_{\rm TP}$

theory is introduced. Specifically, three-nucleon operators at

two-body interaction containing terms up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading
order. The resulting potential is labelled $N\!N\!$+$3N\text{(lnl)}$. The
objective of the present work is to investigate the performance of this new
Hamiltonian across light and medium-mass nuclei. Binding energies, nuclear
radii and excitation spectra are computed using no-core shell model and
self-consistent Green's function approaches. Calculations with
$N\!N\!$+$3N\text{(lnl)}$ are compared to two other representative Hamiltonians
currently in use, namely NNLO$_{\text{sat}}$ and the older $N\!N\!$+$3N(400)$.
Overall, the performance of the novel interaction is very encouraging. In light
nuclei, total energies are generally in good agreement with experimental data.
Known spectra are also well reproduced with a few notable exceptions. The good
description of ground-state energies carries on to heavier nuclei, all the way
from oxygen to nickel isotopes. Except for those involving excitation processes
across the $N=20$ gap, which is overestimated by the new interaction, spectra
are of very good quality, in general superior to those obtained with
NNLO$_{\text{sat}}$. Although largely improving on $N\!N\!$+$3N(400)$ results,
charge radii calculated with $N\!N\!$+$3N\text{(lnl)}$ still underestimate
experimental values, as opposed to the ones computed with NNLO$_{\text{sat}}$
that successfully reproduce available data on nickel. On the whole, the new
two- plus three-nucleon Hamiltonian introduced in the present work represents a
promising alternative to existing nuclear interactions.

planet formed beyond the snow line and migrated to the inner edge of the
circumbinary disk, which was within the unstable area, and then moved to the
current orbit through outward transportation. This outward transportation is
driven by the balance of orbital excitation of the central stars inside the
gravitationally unstable region and damping by the gas-drag force. We carried
out N-body simulations with a dissipating circumbinary protoplanetary disk for
binary systems with different eccentricities and mass ratios. Planets are more
likely to achieve a stable orbit just beyond the unstable region in less
eccentric binary systems. This result is not as sensitive to mass ratio as it
is to eccentricity. These dependencies are consistent with the data from
observed binary systems hosting circumbinary planets. We find CBPs' orbits

can be an attractive solution to form BH links, due to their large available
capacity. When small cells are powered on/off or traffic demands change, the BH
may require reconfiguration, leading to topology and traffic routing changes.
Ideally, such reconfiguration should be seamless and should not impact existing
traffic. However, when using highly directional BH antennas which can be
dynamically rotated to form new links, this can become time-consuming,
requiring the coordination of BH interface movements, link establishment and
traffic routing. In this paper, we propose greedy-based heuristic algorithms to
solve the BH reconfiguration problem in real-time. We numerically compare the
proposed algorithms with the optimal solution obtained by solving a mixed

ferromagnet CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$, and present that a quantum ferromagnetic (FM) phase
transition is easily achieved. In most clean metallic ferromagnets, a quantum
critical point (QCP) at zero field is avoided by changing the FM transition to
a discontinuous transition or to an antiferromagnetic transition. In
CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$, to the contrary, the Curie temperature of 2.5 K decreases
continuously as increasing pressure without any clear signature that the
transition changes to first order. The obvious non Fermi liquid behavior is
observed in the vicinity of the quantum FM phase transition. The experimental
data do not contradict a picture in which CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ shows the FM QCP at
zero field. Band structure calculation suggests the unusual electronic state of
CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ among Ce-based Kondo lattices. CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ deserves further
investigations and will be a key material to understand the matter of the FM
QCP.

text classification approaches can automatically identify documentation
containing specific knowledge types. We compared conventional machine learning
(k-NN and SVM) and deep learning approaches trained on manually annotated Java

individually (i.e., multiple binary classifiers) the best AUPRC was up to 87%.
The deep learning and SVM classifiers seem complementary. For four knowledge
types (Concept, Control, Pattern, and Non-Information), SVM clearly outperforms
deep learning which, on the other hand, is more accurate for identifying the
remaining types. When considering multiple knowledge types at once (i.e.,
multi-label classification) deep learning outperforms na\""ive baselines and
traditional machine learning achieving a MacroAUC up to 79%. We also compared
classifiers using embeddings pre-trained on generic text corpora and
StackOverflow but did not observe significant improvements. Finally, to assess
the generalizability of the classifiers, we re-tested them on a different,
unseen Python documentation dataset. Classifiers for Functionality, Concept,

documentation. The accuracy related to the remaining types seems API-specific.

while Uranus is in equilibrium with solar insulation. Finally, structure models
based on gravity data suggest that Uranus is more centrally condensed than
Neptune. We perform a large suite of high resolution SPH simulations to
investigate whether these differences can be explained by giant impacts. For
Uranus, we find that an oblique impact can tilt its spin axis and eject enough
material to create a disk where the regular satellites are formed. Some of the
disks are massive and extended enough, and consist of enough rocky material to
explain the formation of Uranus' regular satellites. For Neptune, we
investigate whether a head-on collision could mix the interior, and lead to an
adiabatic temperature profile, which may explain its larger flux and higher
moment of inertia value. We find that massive and dense projectiles can
penetrate towards the centre and deposit mass and energy in the deep interior,
leading to a less centrally concentrated interior for Neptune. We conclude that
the dichotomy between the ice giants can be explained by violent impacts after
their formation.

in hyperspectral imagery. As a third-order generalization of principal
component analysis (PCA), its solution of searching for the locally maximum
skewness direction is transformed into the problem of calculating the
eigenpairs (the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors) of a coskewness
tensor. By combining a fixed-point method with an orthogonal constraint, it can
prevent the new eigenpairs from converging to the same maxima that has been
determined before. However, the eigenvectors of the supersymmetric tensor are
not inherently orthogonal in general, which implies that the results obtained
by the search strategy used in PSA may unavoidably deviate from the actual
eigenpairs. In this paper, we propose a new nonorthogonal search strategy to
solve this problem and the new algorithm is named nonorthogonal principal
skewness analysis (NPSA). The contribution of NPSA lies in the finding that the
search space of the eigenvector to be determined can be enlarged by using the
orthogonal complement of the Kronecker product of the previous one, instead of
its orthogonal complement space. We give a detailed theoretical proof to
illustrate why the new strategy can result in the more accurate eigenpairs. In
addition, after some algebraic derivations, the complexity of the presented
algorithm is also greatly reduced. Experiments with both simulated data and
real multi/hyperspectral imagery demonstrate its validity in feature
extraction.

  Non-separating planar graphs are closed under taking minors and are a

a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical properties of metallic
materials specific to micrometer and sub-micrometer scales. At these scales,
the nature of dislocation-mediated plasticity changes radically: sub-micrometer
metallic samples exhibit high yield strengths, however accompanied by
detrimental intermittent strain fluctuations compromising forming processes and
endangering structural stability. In this paper, we studied the effects of
plate-like $\theta^\prime$-Al$_2$Cu precipitates on the strength, plastic
fluctuations and deformation mechanisms of Al-Cu alloys from micro-pillar
compression testing. The plate-like precipitates have diameters commensurate
with the external size of the Al-Cu micro-pillars. Our results show that these
plate-like precipitates can strengthen the materials and suppress plastic
fluctuations efficiently at large sample sizes ($\geq 3 \mu m$). However, the
breakdown of the mean-field pinning landscape at smaller scales weakens its
taming effect on intermittency. Over an intermediate range of sample sizes
allowing the precipitates to cross the entire pillar, an enhanced apparent
strain hardening and a sharp decrease of jerkiness are observed, in association
with the presence of {100}-slip traces along the coherent
$\theta^\prime$-Al$_2$Cu precipitate/$\alpha$-Al matrix interface and
precipitate shearing. These complex effects of plate-like precipitates on
plasticity are analyzed, experimentally and theoretically, in view of the
interferences between external and internal sizes, and the related
modifications of the underlying plastic mechanisms.

the difference in interfacial bonds formed at the Pt/PZT interfaces with

The imperfect screening in Pt/PZT/Pt capacitors is caused by strong interfacial
bonds formed at the interface with (TiZr)O$_2$-terminated film, which is
accompanied by the suppressed polarisation of PZT film. In contrast, the
capacitors with PbO-terminated PZT show a negligible depolarising field and
high polarisation, which is the consequence of weak bonds formed at this type

  Application to Power Systems",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many optimization problems incorporate uncertainty affecting their parameters
and thus their objective functions and constraints. As an example, in
chance-constrained optimization the constraints need to be satisfied with a
certain probability. To solve these problems, scenario optimization is a well
established methodology that ensures feasibility of the solution by enforcing
it to satisfy a given number of samples of the constraints. The main
theoretical results in scenario optimization provide the methods to determine
the necessary number of samples, or to compute the risk based on the number of
so-called support constraints. In this paper, we propose a methodology to
remove constraints after observing the number of support constraints and the
consequent risk. Additionally, we show the effectiveness of the approach with
an illustrative example and an application to power distribution grid
management when solving the optimal power flow problem. In this problem,
uncertainty in the loads converts the admissible voltage limits into
chance-constraints.

that a 3D space with the semi-major axis, the eccentricity and the inclination
of the orbit with respect to the MW plane as its axes is helpful in order to
dig into the formation of the GC system. We find that GCs formed in-situ show a
clear correlation between their eccentricities and their orbital inclination in
the sense that clusters with large eccentricities also have large inclinations.
These GCs also show a correlation between their distance to the MW center and
their eccentricity. Accreted GCs do not exhibit a relationship between
eccentricity and inclination, but span a wide variety of inclinations at
eccentricities larger than ~ 0.5. Finally, we computed the velocity anisotropy
""beta"" of the GC system and found for GCs formed in-situ that ""beta"" decreases
from ~ 0.8 down to 0.3 from the outermost regions towards the MW center, but
remains fairly constant (0.7-0.9) for accreted ones. These findings can be
explained if GCs formed from gas that collapsed radially in the outskirts, with
preference for relative high infall angles. As the material reached the
rotating forming disk, it became more circular and moved with lower inclination
relative to the disk. A half of the GC population was accreted and deposited in
orbits covering the entire range of energies from the outer halo to the bulge.

computation, a question is: What can biochemical circuits compute? This paper
considers the problem of using biochemical circuits to distinguish persistent
signals from transient ones. We define a statistical detection problem over a
reaction pathway consisting of three species: an inducer, a transcription
factor (TF) and a gene promoter, where the inducer can activate the TF and an
active TF can bind to the gene promoter. We model the pathway using the
chemical master equation so the counts of bound promoters over time is a
stochastic signal. We consider the problem of using the continuous-time
stochastic signal of the counts of bound promoters to infer whether the inducer
signal is persistent or not. We use statistical detection theory to derive the
solution to this detection problem, which is to compute the log-likelihood
ratio of observing a persistent signal to a transient one. We then show, using
time-scale separation and other assumptions, that this log-likelihood ratio can
be approximately computed by using the continuous-time signals of the number of
active TF molecules and the number of bound promoters when the input is
persistent. Finally, we show that the coherent feedforward gene circuits can be

hierarchical models that are able to account for random variability inherent in
the underlying time-dynamics, as well as the variability between experimental
units and, optionally, account for measurement error. Fully Bayesian inference
for state-space SDEMEMs is performed, using data at discrete times that may be
incomplete and subject to measurement error. However, the inference problem is
complicated by the typical intractability of the observed data likelihood which
motivates the use of sampling-based approaches such as Markov chain Monte
Carlo. A Gibbs sampler is proposed to target the marginal posterior of all
parameter values of interest. The algorithm is made computationally efficient
through careful use of blocking strategies and correlated pseudo-marginal
Metropolis-Hastings steps within the Gibbs scheme. The resulting methodology is
flexible and is able to deal with a large class of SDEMEMs. The methodology is
demonstrated on three case studies, including tumor growth dynamics and
neuronal data. The gains in terms of increased computational efficiency are
model and data dependent, but unless bespoke sampling strategies requiring
analytical derivations are possible for a given model, we generally observe an
efficiency increase of one order of magnitude when using correlated particle
methods together with our blocked-Gibbs strategy.

that a sampling distribution based on the leverage scores of a tall matrix

performance and a significant speedup. We derive an expression of the
complexity of the algorithm in terms of the number of samples that are
necessary to meet an error tolerance specification with high probability, and
an upper bound for the distance between the sketched and the high-dimensional
solutions. Our analysis shows that the projection not only reduces the
dimension of the problem but also regularises the reduced system against
sketching error. Our numerical simulations suggest speed improvements of two
orders of magnitude in exchange for a small loss in the accuracy of the

origin of this abnormal phenomenon, a toy model is proposed in which the
external-E-field-controlled sign change of the RKKY interaction in the SAF
structure provides an extra contribution to the total energy that helps
thespins overcome the energy barrier and break the processional switching
mechanism.

shown to counteract the inferential error produced by the presence of

increasing the error committed in estimating the population mean and STD. We
show that those methods that have the highest efficacy in counteract the
inflation of Type I and Type II errors in the presence of contaminating

and further development of such approaches is necessary to identify the key
features of these active systems. Here we present a general perturbative
calculation scheme for swimmers composed of beads interacting by harmonic
potentials, driven by an arbitrary force protocol. The hydrodynamic
interactions are treated using the Oseen and Rotne-Pragner approximations. We
validate our approach by using 3 bead assemblies and comparing the results with

flow of the devices. Consequently, we are able to identify a behavior of the
swimmer that is richer than predicted in previous models. Given its generality,
the framework can be applied to any swimmer geometry, driving protocol and
beads interactions, as well as in many swimmers problems.

techniques to verify the correctness of distributed algorithms for robots
evolving in a \emph{continuous} environment. The study focuses on the problem
of rendezvous of two robots with lights.
  There exist many different rendezvous algorithms that aim at finding the
minimal number of colors needed to solve rendezvous in various synchrony models
(e.g., FSYNC, SSYNC, ASYNC). While these rendezvous algorithms are typically
very simple, their analysis and proof of correctness tend to be extremely
complex, tedious, and error-prone as impossibility results are based on subtle
interactions between robots activation schedules.
  The paper presents a generic verification model written for the SPIN
model-checker. In particular, we explain the subtle design decisions that allow
to keep the search space finite and tractable, as well as prove several
important theorems that support them. As a sanity check, we use the model to
verify several known rendezvous algorithms in six different models of
synchrony. In each case, we find that the results obtained from the
model-checker are consistent with the results known in the literature. The
model-checker outputs a counter-example execution in every case that is known
to fail.
  In the course of developing and proving the validity of the model, we
identified several fundamental theorems, including the ability for a well
chosen algorithm and ASYNC scheduler to produce an emerging property of memory
in a system of oblivious mobile robots, and why it is not a problem for
luminous rendezvous algorithms.

$U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. The algebra $U^+_q$ has a presentation with
two generators $A,B$ that satisfy the cubic $q$-Serre relations. Recently we
introduced a type of element in $U^+_q$, said to be alternating. Each
alternating element commutes with exactly one of $A$, $B$, $qBA-q^{-1}AB$,
$qAB-q^{-1}BA$; this gives four types of alternating elements. There are
infinitely many alternating elements of each type, and these mutually commute.
In the present paper we use the alternating elements to obtain a central
extension $\mathcal U^+_q$ of $U^+_q$. We define $\mathcal U^+_q$ by generators
and relations. These generators, said to be alternating, are in bijection with
the alternating elements of $U^+_q$. We display a surjective algebra
homomorphism $\mathcal U^+_q \to U^+_q$ that sends each alternating generator
of $\mathcal U^+_q$ to the corresponding alternating element in $U^+_q$. We
adjust this homomorphism to obtain an algebra isomorphism $\mathcal U_q^+ \to

Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 as an example, we demonstrate that the flat conduction band

two metal cations with different d orbital configurations using the
first-principles calculations. The predicted carrier mobilities show huge
anisotropy along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions in Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6,
further confirming the 2D electronic properties. In addition, the anisotropic

Finally, uPIT and DC are jointly trained, which directly optimizes the actual
separation objectives. Moreover, in order to maximize the distance of each
permutation, the discriminative learning is applied to fine tuning the whole
model. Our experiments are conducted on WSJ0-2mix dataset. Experimental results
show that the proposed models achieve better performances than DC and uPIT for
speaker-independent speech separation.

rotation of pulsars. For the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, the glitch sizes
and the times between consecutive events have clear preferred scales, contrary
to the handful of other pulsars with enough glitches for such a study.
Moreover, PSR J0537-6910 is the only pulsar showing a strong positive
correlation between the size of each glitch and the waiting time until the
following one.
  We attempt to understand this behavior through a detailed study of the
distributions and correlations of glitch properties for the eight pulsars with
at least ten detected glitches. We model the distributions of glitch sizes and
times between consecutive glitches for this sample and perform Monte Carlo
simulations to explore two hypotheses that could explain why the correlation is
so much weaker in other pulsars than in PSR J0537-6910.
  We confirm the above results for the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, and
verify that the latter is the only pulsar with a strong correlation between
glitch size and waiting time to the following glitch. For the remaining six
pulsars, the waiting time distributions are best fitted by exponentials, and
the size distributions either by power laws, exponentials, or log-normal
functions. Some pulsars in the sample yield significant Pearson and Spearman
coefficients ($r_p$ and $r_s$) for the aforementioned correlation. Moreover,
for all except the Crab, both coefficients are positive. Our simulations show
that the weaker correlations in pulsars other than PSR J0537$-$6910 cannot be
due to missing glitches too small to be detected. We also tested the hypothesis
that each pulsar may have two kinds of glitches, namely large, correlated ones
and small, uncorrelated ones. We found for all pulsars that their glitches are
not consistent with a pure uncorrelated population either.

the poorly understood, very short-lived common envelope phase. Most hot
subdwarfs (sdO/Bs) are the bare He-burning cores of red giants which have lost
almost all of their hydrogen envelopes. This mass loss is often triggered by
common envelope interactions with close stellar or even sub-stellar companions.
In the recently published catalog of eclipsing binaries in the Galactic Bulge
and in the ATLAS survey, we discovered 161 new eclipsing systems showing a
reflection effect by visual inspection of the light curves and using a
machine-learning algorithm. The EREBOS (Eclipsing Reflection Effect Binaries
from Optical Surveys) project aims at analyzing all newly discovered eclipsing
binaries with reflection effect based on a spectroscopic and photometric follow
up. To constrain the nature of the primary we derived the absolute magnitude
and the reduced proper motion of all our targets with the help of the
parallaxes and proper motions measured by the Gaia mission and compared those
to the Gaia white dwarf catalogue. For a sub-set of our targets with observed
spectra the nature could be derived by measuring the atmospheric parameter of
the primary confirming that less than 10\% of our systems are not sdO/Bs with
cool companions but white dwarfs or central stars of planetary nebula. This
large sample of eclipsing hot subdwarfs with cool companions allowed us to
derive a significant period distribution for hot subdwarfs with cool companions

previously thought and ideally suited to find the lowest mass companions to hot
subdwarf stars. In the future several new photometric surveys will be carried

observable at high redshifts. Their usefulness as unbiased estimators of
absolute cosmological distances however depends on accurate understanding of
their intrinsic brightness, or anchoring their distance scale. This knowledge
is based on calibrating their distances with Cepheids. Gravitational waves from
compact binary coalescences, being standard sirens, can be used to validate
distances to SNe Ia, when both occur in the same galaxy or galaxy cluster. The
current measurement of distances by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detector
network suffers from large statistical errors ($\sim 50\%$). However, we find
that using a third generation gravitational-wave detector network, standard
sirens will allow us to measure distances with an accuracy of $\sim
0.1\%$-$3\%$ for sources within $\le300$ Mpc. These are much smaller than the
dominant systematic error of $\sim 5\%$ due to radial peculiar velocity of host
galaxies. Therefore, gravitational-wave observations could soon add a new
cosmic distance ladder for an independent calibration of distances to SNe Ia.

privileged adversary, such as a malicious or compromised cloud provider. To
provide confidentiality and integrity even in the presence of such an
adversary, a number of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have been
developed. A TEE aims to protect data and code within its environment against
high privileged adversaries, such as a malicious operating system or
hypervisor.
  While mechanisms exist to attest a TEE's integrity at load time, there are no
mechanisms to attest its integrity at runtime. Additionally, work also exists
that discusses mechanisms to verify the runtime integrity of programs and
system components. However, those verification mechanisms are themselves not
protected against attacks from a high privileged adversary. It is therefore
desirable to combine the protection mechanisms of TEEs with the ability of
application runtime integrity verification.
  In this paper, we present Scanclave, a lightweight design which achieves
three design goals: Trustworthiness of the verifier, a minimal trusted software
stack and the possibility to access an application's memory from a TEE. Having
achieved our goals, we are able to verify the runtime integrity of applications
even in the presence of a high privileged adversary.
  We refrain from discussing which properties define the runtime integrity of
an application, as different applications will require different verification
methods. Instead, we show how Scanclave enables a remote verifier to determine
the runtime integrity of an application. Afterwards, we perform a security
analysis for the different steps of our design. Additionally, we discuss
different enclave implementations that might be used for the implementation of
Scanclave.

on benchmark test cases in both steady and unsteady settings with Reynolds up

of affect dimensions. Dimensions to be predicted often include arousal and
valence. Continuous affect prediction researchers are now embracing multimodal
model input. This provides motivation for researchers to investigate previously
unexplored affective cues. Speech-based cues have traditionally received the
most attention for affect prediction, however, non-verbal inputs have
significant potential to increase the performance of affective computing
systems and in addition, allow affect modelling in the absence of speech.
However, non-verbal inputs that have received little attention for continuous
affect prediction include eye and head-based cues. The eyes are involved in
emotion displays and perception while head-based cues have been shown to
contribute to emotion conveyance and perception. Additionally, these cues can
be estimated non-invasively from video, using modern computer vision tools.
This work exploits this gap by comprehensively investigating head and eye-based
features and their combination with speech for continuous affect prediction.
Hand-crafted, automatically generated and CNN-learned features from these
modalities will be investigated for continuous affect prediction. The highest
performing feature sets and feature set combinations will answer how effective
these features are for the prediction of an individual's affective state.

inversion of appropriate matrices and the determination of the roots of an
appropriate polynomial, constructed using discretized derivatives of the
correlation function. The method is tested strictly using fake data generated
assuming a fixed number of exponential signals included in the correlation
function with a controlled numerical precision and within given statistical
fluctuations. All the exponential signals together with their statistical
uncertainties are determined exactly by the algorithm. The only limiting factor
is the numerical rounding off. In the case of correlation functions evaluated
by large-scale QCD simulations on the lattice various sources of noise, other
than the numerical rounding, can affect the correlation function and they
represent the crucial factor limiting the number of exponential signals,
related to the hadronic spectral decomposition of the correlation function,
that can be properly extracted. The algorithm can be applied to a large variety

a homogeneous grid structure. However, the interpolation method influences the
magnetic field properties on the scales of the grid spacing and the choice of
interpolation routine can therefore change the result. At the same time, it
provides an impact, i.e.\ error, on the spatial particle distribution. We
compare three different interpolation routines -- trilinear, tricubic and
nearest neighbor interpolation -- in the case of turbulent magnetic fields and
show that there is no benefit in using trilinear interpolation. We show that in
comparison, the nearest neighbor interpolation provides the best performance,
i.e.\ requires least CPU time and results in the smallest error. In addition,
we optimize the performance of an algorithm that generates a continuous
grid-less turbulent magnetic field by more than an order of magnitude. This
continuous method becomes practicable for the simulation of large particle

show that by using more than 100 wave-modes the diffusive behavior of the

massive MIMO systems, most of which stand from the communications viewpoint. A
new trend of investigating massive MIMO, especially for the sparse scenario
like millimeter wave (mmWave) transmission, is to re-build the transceiver
design from array signal processing viewpoint that could deeply exploit the
half-wavelength array and provide enhanced performances in many aspects. For
example, the high dimensional channel could be decomposed into small amount of
physical parameters, e.g., angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD),
multi-path delay, Doppler shift, etc. As a consequence, transceiver techniques
like synchronization, channel estimation, beamforming, precoding, multi-user
access, etc., can be re-shaped with these physical parameters, as opposed to
those designed directly with channel state information (CSI). Interestingly,
parameters like AoA/AoD and multi-path delay are frequency insensitive and thus
can be used to guide the down-link transmission from uplink training even for
FDD systems. Moreover, some phenomena of massive MIMO that were vaguely
revealed previously can be better explained now with array signal processing,
e.g., the beam squint effect. In all, the target of this paper is to present an
overview of recent progress on merging array signal processing into massive

invalidating the obtained results. In this paper, a solution for basic
non-acted emotion recognition based on 3D skeleton and Deep Neural Networks

First, unlike the current state-of-the-art in non-acted body affect

the structure, function and failure of many complex socio-technical networks.
Thus, there is great interest in analyzing phase transitions to large-scale
connectivity and to global synchronization, including how to enhance or delay
the onset. These phenomena are traditionally studied as second-order phase
transitions where, at the critical threshold, the order parameter increases
rapidly but continuously. In 2009, an extremely abrupt transition was found for
a network growth process where links compete for addition in attempt to delay
percolation. This observation of ""explosive percolation"" was ultimately
revealed to be a continuous transition in the thermodynamic limit, yet with
very atypical finite-size scaling, and it started a surge of work on explosive
phenomena and their consequences. Many related models are now shown to yield
discontinuous percolation transitions and even hybrid transitions. Explosive
percolation enables many other features such as multiple giant components,
modular structures, discrete scale invariance and non-self-averaging, relating
to properties found in many real phenomena such as explosive epidemics,
electric breakdowns and the emergence of molecular life. Models of explosive
synchronization provide an analytic framework for the dynamics of abrupt
transitions and reveal the interplay between the distribution in natural
frequencies and the network structure, with applications ranging from epileptic
seizures to waking from anesthesia. Here we review the vast literature on
explosive phenomena and synthesize the fundamental connections between models
and survey the application areas. We attempt to classify explosive phenomena
based on underlying mechanisms and to provide a coherent overview and
perspective for future research to address the many vital questions that

initial value problem of a system consisting of a quantum scalar field weakly
interacting with a classical one. The quantum field obeys a Klein-Gordon
equation with a potential proportional to the classical field. The classical
field obeys an inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation sourced by the renormalised
expectation value of the squared quantum field in a Hadamard state, $\langle
\Psi| \Phi^2 \Psi \rangle$. Thus, the system of equations for the scalar fields
reminisces of the semi-classical Einstein field equations with a Klein-Gordon
field, where classical geometry is sourced by the renormalised stress-energy
tensor of the quantum field, and the Klein-Gordon equation depends on the
metric explicitly. We show that a unique asymptotic solution for the system can
be obtained perturbatively at any fixed finite order in the weak coupling from
initial data provided that the interaction is switched on and off smoothly in a
spacetime region to the future of the initial data surface. This allows one to
provide ""free"" initial data for the decoupled system that guarantees that the
Wightman function of the quantum field be of Hadamard form, and hence that the
renormalised $\langle \Psi| \Phi^2 \Psi \rangle$ exist (in a perturbative
sense) and be smooth. We comment on how to relax the switching of the
interaction, which might be relevant for the corresponding problem in
semiclassical gravity.

cylindrical shapes, but the ground state of large-diameter tubes actually
corresponds to a collapsed dumbbell-like structure, where the opposite sides of
the nanotube wall are brought in contact and stabilized by van der Waals
attraction. For those tubes, the cylindrical shape is metastable and it is
interesting to investigate the energy barrier for jumping from one
configuration to another. We calculate the energy barrier for SWNT collapse by
considering a transition pathway that consists of an initial local deformation
that subsequently propagates itself along the SWNT axis. This leads to finite
and physically meaningful energy barriers in the limit of infinite nanotubes.
Yet, such barriers are surprisingly large (tens of eV) and therefore virtually
unsurmountable, which essentially prevents the thermal collapse of a metastable
cylindrical at any reasonable temperatures. Moreover, we show that collapse
barriers increase counterintuitively with SWNT diameter. Finally, we
demonstrate that, despite such huge barriers, SWNTs may collapse relatively
easily under external radial forces and we shed light on recent experimental
observations of collapsed and cylindrical SWNTs of various diameters.

problems and in machine learning problems, settings that involve estimating
quantities that are difficult to compute exactly. How much can quantum
computers speed up classical Markov chain algorithms? In this work we consider
the problem of speeding up simulated annealing algorithms, where the stationary
distributions of the Markov chains are Gibbs distributions at temperatures
specified according to an annealing schedule.
  We construct a quantum algorithm that both adaptively constructs an annealing
schedule and quantum samples at each temperature. Our adaptive annealing
schedule roughly matches the length of the best classical adaptive annealing
schedules and improves on nonadaptive temperature schedules by roughly a
quadratic factor. Our dependence on the Markov chain gap matches other quantum
algorithms and is quadratically better than what classical Markov chains
achieve. Our algorithm is the first to combine both of these quadratic
improvements. Like other quantum walk algorithms, it also improves on classical
algorithms by producing ""qsamples"" instead of classical samples. This means
preparing quantum states whose amplitudes are the square roots of the target
probability distribution.
  In constructing the annealing schedule we make use of amplitude estimation,
and we introduce a method for making amplitude estimation nondestructive at
almost no additional cost, a result that may have independent interest. Finally
we demonstrate how this quantum simulated annealing algorithm can be applied to
the problems of estimating partition functions and Bayesian inference.

  Springer- Nature, New York. 2019",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper I introduce a framework for modeling temporal communication
networks and dynamical processes unfolding on such networks. The framework
originates from the realization that there is a meaningful division of temporal
communication networks into six dynamic classes, where the class of a network
is determined by its generating process. In particular, each class is
characterized by a fundamental structure: a temporal-topological network motif,
which corresponds to the network representation of communication events in that
class of network. These fundamental structures constrain network
configurations: only certain configurations are possible within a dynamic
class. In this way the framework presented here highlights strong constraints
on network structures, which simplify analyses and shape network flows.
Therefore the fundamental structures hold the potential to impact how we model
temporal networks overall. I argue below that networks within the same class
can be meaningfully compared, and modeled using similar techniques, but that
integrating statistics across networks belonging to separate classes is not
meaningful in general. This paper presents a framework for how to analyze
networks in general, rather than a particular result of analyzing a particular
dataset. I hope, however, that readers interested in modeling temporal networks
will find the ideas and discussion useful in spite of the paper's more
conceptual nature.

Telescopes (VLT). The goals of this survey are to study the properties of the
circum-galactic medium around $z\sim1$ star-forming galaxies. The
absorption-line selected survey consists of 79 strong \MgII\ absorbers (with
rest-frame equivalent width (REW)$\gtrsim$0.3\AA) and, currently, 86 associated
galaxies within 100 projected~kpc of the quasar with stellar masses ($M_\star$)
from $10^9$ to $10^{11}$ \msun. We find that the cool halo gas traced by \MgII\
is not isotropically distributed around these galaxies, as we show the strong
bi-modal distribution in the azimuthal angle of the apparent location of the
quasar with respect to the galaxy major-axis. This supports a scenario in which
outflows are bi-conical in nature and co-exist with a coplanar gaseous
structure extending at least up to 60 to 80 kpc. Assuming that absorbers near
the minor axis probe outflows, the current MEGAFLOW sample allowed us to select
26 galaxy-quasar pairs suitable for studying winds. From this sample, using a
simple geometrical model, we find that the outflow velocity only exceeds the
escape velocity when $M_{\star}\lesssim 4\times10^9$~\msun, implying the cool
material is likely to fall back except in the smallest halos. Finally, we find
that the mass loading factor $\eta$, the ratio between the ejected mass rate
and the star formation rate (SFR), appears to be roughly constant with respect
to the galaxy mass.

for desired light manipulations via wavefront shaping. Recent advanced chip
applications further require their feature sizes to move down to the
subwavelength, which inevitably brings forth vectorial effects of optical
fields and makes the typical scalar-based theory invalid. However, simulating
and optimizing their vectorial fields, which are associated with billions of
adjustable parameters in the optical element, are difficult to do, because of
the issues of numerical stability and the highly-demanding computational cost.
To address this problem, this research proposes an applicable algorithm by
means of a wave-vector (k) series approximation of vectorial optical fields. On
the basis of the semi-analytical rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA), an
adequate selection scheme on k-series enables computationally efficient yet
still predictive calculations for DOEs. The performance estimations for
exemplary designs by the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method show that
the predicted intensity profiles by the proposed algorithm agree with the
target by just a fractional error. Together with optimizing the geometrical
degrees of freedom (e.g., DOE depth h) as compensation for errors from the
truncation of k-series, the algorithm demonstrates its outperformance by one or
two orders of magnitude in accuracy versus the scalar-based model, and demands
only a reasonable computational resource.

bremsstrahlung (RSB) of ultrarelativistic electrons under the condition of
scattering on a nucleus in the field of a weak electromagnetic wave. The
progression of the functional mechanism indicates the transformation of the
intermediate virtual electron into the real particle state. As a result, the
initial second order process with accordance to the fine structure constant in
the light field productively splits into two consequent first order formations:
the laser-stimulated Compton effect and the laser-assisted scattering of an
electron on a nucleus. It is important to emphasize that the resonance
escalation possesses a possibility to develop within two reaction channels.
Therefore, the first channel - delineates the occurrence that correlates to the
spontaneous photon emission by an electron with subsequent scattering on a
nucleus. The second channel - illustrates the configuration corresponding to
the electron scattering on a nucleus with consecutive spontaneous photon
emission in the wave field. Moreover, the spontaneous photon radiation angle
allocates a single-valued dependency with the resonant frequency for the first
channel in contrast to the second displacement that categorizes a composite
area with three various resonant frequency magnitudes for the particular
emission angle diapason. The project data analysis proposes that the reaction
channels do not interfere within the whole range of observation. To summarize,
the investigation calculates that the particular cross-section within the
resonant ambience significantly exceeds the according cross-section in the
approximation of an external field absence. In conclusion, numerous scientific
facilities with specialization in pulsed laser radiation (SLAC, FAIR, XFEL,

Normalization (SN), which learns to select different normalizers for different
normalization layers of a deep neural network. SN employs three distinct scopes
to compute statistics (means and variances) including a channel, a layer, and a
minibatch. SN switches between them by learning their importance weights in an
end-to-end manner. It has several good properties. First, it adapts to various
network architectures and tasks. Second, it is robust to a wide range of batch
sizes, maintaining high performance even when small minibatch is presented
(e.g. 2 images/GPU). Third, SN does not have sensitive hyper-parameter, unlike
group normalization that searches the number of groups as a hyper-parameter.
Without bells and whistles, SN outperforms its counterparts on various
challenging benchmarks, such as ImageNet, COCO, CityScapes, ADE20K, MegaFace,
and Kinetics. Analyses of SN are also presented to answer the following three
questions: (a) Is it useful to allow each normalization layer to select its own
normalizer? (b) What impacts the choices of normalizers? (c) Do different tasks
and datasets prefer different normalizers? We hope SN will help ease the usage
and understand the normalization techniques in deep learning. The code of SN

people worldwide and manifested by recurrent unprovoked seizures. The
unpredictability of seizures not only degrades the quality of life of the
patients, but it can also be life-threatening. Modern systems monitoring
electroencephalography (EEG) signals are being currently developed with the
view to detect epileptic seizures in order to alert caregivers and reduce the
impact of seizures on patients' quality of life. Such seizure detection systems
employ state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms that require a considerably
large amount of labeled personal data for training. However, acquiring EEG
signals of epileptic seizures is a costly and time-consuming process for
medical experts and patients, currently requiring in-hospital recordings in
specialized units. In this work, we generate synthetic seizure-like brain
electrical activities, i.e., EEG signals, that can be used to train seizure
detection algorithms, alleviating the need for recorded data. First, we train a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with data from 30 epilepsy patients. Then,
we generate synthetic personalized training sets for new, unseen patients,
which overall yield higher detection performance than the real-data training
sets. We demonstrate our results using the datasets from the EPILEPSIAE

  We consider an inhomogeneous Dirichlet Boundary Value Problem on $ B

P$, $u=M$, a nonzero constant on $\partial B$. Here, the planar obstacle $P$ is
invariant under the action of a dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_n$, $n \in
\mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 3$, and $B$ is a planar disk containing $P$. We make the
following assumptions on $P$ and $B$: (0) the volume constraint on $P$ and $B$
both, (i) invariance of both $B$ and $P$ under the action of the same dihedral
group, (ii) $B$ and $P$ need not be concentric, (iii) smoothness condition on
both the boundaries, (iv) a monotonicity condition on the boundary $\partial P$
of the obstacle $P$. Examples of such obstacles include regular polygons with
smoothened corners, ellipses, among other star-shaped domains. In this setting,
we investigate the extremal configurations of the obstacle $P$ with respect to
the disk $B$, for the energy functional $E$ associated with the boundary value
problem.

planar nematic liquid crystal. The class of problems considered here sheds some
light into optimal locations of holes with a certain symmetry inside a
nematic-filled disc, so as to optimise the corresponding one-constant nematic

both the ability of the network to route traffic and the amount of processing
it can perform. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem accounting
for the main features of 5G nodes and the traffic they serve, allowing joint
decisions about (i) the nodes to activate, (ii) the network functions they run,
and (iii) the traffic routing. Our optimization module is integrated within the
management and orchestration framework of 5G, thus enabling swift and
high-quality decisions. We test our scheme with both a real-world testbed based
on OpenStack and OpenDaylight, and a large-scale emulated network whose
topology and traffic come from a real-world mobile operator, finding it to
consistently outperform state-of-the art alternatives and closely match the
optimum.

a common consensus value that is equal to the quantized average. We conclude
with comparisons against existing quantized average consensus algorithms that

their significance in the general context of stellar astrophysics is the
consideration of the most extreme properties displayed by some of them. In that
context, HD 965 is particularly interesting, as it combines some of the most
pronounced chemical peculiarities with one of the longest rotation periods
known.
  Aims. We characterise the variations of the magnetic field of the Ap star HD
965 and derive constraints about its structure.
  Methods. We combine published measurements of the mean longitudinal field
<Bz> of HD 965 with new determinations of this field moment from circular
spectropolarimetry obtained at the 6-m telescope BTA of the Special
Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. For the mean
magnetic field modulus <B>, literature data are complemented by the analysis of
ESO archive spectra.
  Results. We present the first determination of the rotation period of HD 965,
P = (16.5+/-0.5) y. HD 965 is only the third Ap star with a period longer than
10 years for which magnetic field measurements have been obtained over more
than a full cycle. The variation curve of <Bz> is well approximated by a cosine
wave. <B> does not show any significant variation. The observed behaviour of
these field moments is well represented by a simple model consisting of the
superposition of collinear dipole, quadrupole and octupole. The distribution of
neodymium over the surface of HD 965 is highly non-uniform. The element appears
concentrated around the magnetic poles, especially the negative one.
  Conclusions. The shape of the longitudinal magnetic variation curve of HD 965
indicates that its magnetic field is essentially symmetric about an axis
passing through the centre of the star. Overall, as far as its magnetic field
is concerned, HD 965 appears similar to the bulk of the long-period Ap stars.

initial guidance, after which evidence increasingly dominates. One should start
with scalar gravity; evidence required spin 2. Good beliefs are scarce, so
don't change without reason. But does conservatism prevent conceptual

shows that 'progress' isn't unidirectional.) GR is surprisingly intelligible.
Energy localization makes sense if one believes Noether mathematics: an
infinity of symmetries shouldn't produce just one energy. Hamiltonian change
results from Lagrangian-equivalence. Causality poses conceptual questions. For
GR, what are canonical 'equal-time' commutators? For massive spin 2, background
causality exists but is violated. Both might be cured by engineering a

analyze the combinatorial interaction of ligands loaded on polymeric scaffolds,
in both a continuum and discrete setting, and compare it with multivalent
scaffolds with fixed number of binding sites. The quantity of interest is the
abundance of ligand interaction possibilities---the catalytic potential
$Q$---in a configurational mixture. Upon increasing scaffold abundance,
scaffolding systems are known to first increase opportunities for ligand
interaction and then to shut them down as ligands become isolated on distinct
scaffolds. The polymerizing system stands out in that the dependency of $Q$ on
protomer concentration switches from being dominated by a first order to a
second order term within a range determined by the polymerization affinity.
This behavior boosts $Q$ beyond that of any multivalent scaffold system. In
addition, the subsequent drop-off is considerably mitigated in that $Q$
decreases with half the power in protomer concentration than for any
multivalent scaffold. We explain this behavior in terms of how the
concentration profile of the polymer length distribution adjusts to changes in
protomer concentration and affinity. The discrete case turns out to be similar,
but the behavior can be exaggerated at small protomer numbers because of a
maximal polymer size, analogous to finite-size effects in bond percolation on a
lattice.

using a coupled optoelectronic model to determine the optimal bandgap grading
of the nonhomogeneous CIGS layer in the thickness direction. The bandgap of the
CIGS layer was either sinusoidally or linearly graded, and the solar cell was
modeled to have a metallic backreflector corrugated periodically along a fixed
direction in the plane. The model predicts that specially tailored bandgap
grading can significantly improve the efficiency, with much smaller
improvements due to the periodic corrugations. An efficiency of 27.7% with the
conventional 2200-nm-thick CIGS layer is predicted with sinusoidal bandgap
grading, in comparison to 22% efficiency obtained experimentally with
homogeneous bandgap. Furthermore, the inclusion of sinusoidal grading increases
the predicted efficiency to 22.89% with just a 600-nm-thick CIGS layer. These
high efficiencies arise due to a large electron-hole-pair generation rate in
the narrow-bandgap regions and the elevation of the open-circuit voltage due to
a wider bandgap in the region toward the front surface of the CIGS layer. Thus,
bandgap nonhomogeneity, in conjunction with periodic corrugation of the

used for applications with time-series and sequential data. Recently, there has
been a strong interest in executing RNNs on embedded devices. However,
difficulties have arisen because RNN requires high computational capability and
a large memory space. In this paper, we review existing implementations of RNN
models on embedded platforms and discuss the methods adopted to overcome the
limitations of embedded systems.
  We will define the objectives of mapping RNN algorithms on embedded platforms
and the challenges facing their realization. Then, we explain the components of
RNN models from an implementation perspective. We also discuss the
optimizations applied to RNNs to run efficiently on embedded platforms.
Finally, we compare the defined objectives with the implementations and
highlight some open research questions and aspects currently not addressed for
embedded RNNs.
  Overall, applying algorithmic optimizations to RNN models and decreasing the
memory access overhead is vital to obtain high efficiency. To further increase
the implementation efficiency, we point up the more promising optimizations
that could be applied in future research. Additionally, this article observes
that high performance has been targeted by many implementations, while
flexibility has, as yet, been attempted less often. Thus, the article provides
some guidelines for RNN hardware designers to support flexibility in a better
manner.

We experimentally achieve a signal contrast enhancement of 40, which leads to a
bit error rate (BER) improvement by 5 orders of magnitude and a receiver
sensitivity improvement of 11 dB. We present the thresholding function of our
device and validate the function with experimental data. Furthermore, we

infrastructure of mobile technologies. The increase in the use of wireless
local area networks and the use of satellite services are also noticed. The
high utilization rate of mobile devices for various purposes makes clear the
need to track wireless networks to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of
the information transmitted. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and
efficiently identify the normal and abnormal traffic of such networks, so that
administrators can take action. This work aims to analyze classification
techniques in relation to data from Wireless Networks, using some classes of
anomalies pre-established according to some defined criteria of the MAC layer.
For data analysis, WEKA Data Mining software (Waikato Environment for Knowledge
Analysis) is used. The classification algorithms present a success rate in the
classification of viable data, being indicated in the use of intrusion
detection systems for wireless networks.

new stream applications and big data scenarios. One of the most promising
techniques in stream learning is the Spiking Neural Network, and some of them
use an interesting population encoding scheme to transform the incoming stimuli
into spikes. This study sheds lights on the key issue of this encoding scheme,
the Gaussian receptive fields, and focuses on applying them as a pre-processing
technique to any dataset in order to gain representativeness, and to boost the
predictive performance of the stream learning methods. Experiments with
synthetic and real data sets are presented, and lead to confirm that our
approach can be applied successfully as a general pre-processing technique in

  Perspectives",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Applications that generate huge amounts of data in the form of fast streams
are becoming increasingly prevalent, being therefore necessary to learn in an
online manner. These conditions usually impose memory and processing time
restrictions, and they often turn into evolving environments where a change may
affect the input data distribution. Such a change causes that predictive models
trained over these stream data become obsolete and do not adapt suitably to new
distributions. Specially in these non-stationary scenarios, there is a pressing
need for new algorithms that adapt to these changes as fast as possible, while
maintaining good performance scores. Unfortunately, most off-the-shelf
classification models need to be retrained if they are used in changing
environments, and fail to scale properly. Spiking Neural Networks have revealed
themselves as one of the most successful approaches to model the behavior and
learning potential of the brain, and exploit them to undertake practical online
learning tasks. Besides, some specific flavors of Spiking Neural Networks can
overcome the necessity of retraining after a drift occurs. This work intends to
merge both fields by serving as a comprehensive overview, motivating further
developments that embrace Spiking Neural Networks for online learning
scenarios, and being a friendly entry point for non-experts.

addresses the problems related with the network connectivity and training in an
elegant and efficient way. However, important questions regarding impact of
reservoir size and learning routines on the convergence-speed during learning
remain unaddressed. Here, we study in detail the learning process of a recently
demonstrated photonic neural network based on a reservoir. We use a greedy
algorithm to train our neural network for the task of chaotic signals
prediction and analyze the learning-error landscape. Our results unveil
fundamental properties of the system's optimization hyperspace. Particularly,
we determine the convergence speed of learning as a function of reservoir size
and find exceptional, close to linear scaling. This linear dependence, together
with our parallel diffractive coupling, represent optimal scaling conditions
for our photonic neural network scheme.
