with disabilities in STEM, many postsecondary institutions are not equipped to
support students with disabilities. We examined the digital accessibility of
139 webpages from 73 postsecondary institutions that contained information
about the undergraduate physics curriculum and graduate research programs. We
selected these webpages as they are common entry points for students interested
in pursuing a physics degree. We used Tenon and Mac OS X's Voiceover software
to assess the accessibility of these webpages as measured by alignment with the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. We found only one webpage was
accessible for students with disabilities. We present five common accessibility
errors we identified in the webpages in our sample, suggested solutions for
these errors, and implications for students with disabilities, instructors and
staff, institutional administration, and the broader physics community.

algorithms (for example, $k$-means or hierarchical agglomerative clustering
(HAC) require prohibitive computational cost and memory. In this paper, we
propose a solution to these clustering problems by extending threshold
clustering (TC) to problems of instance selection. TC is a recently developed
clustering algorithm designed to partition data into many small clusters in
linearithmic time (on average). Our proposed clustering method is as follows.
First, TC is performed and clusters are reduced into single ""prototype"" points.
Then, TC is applied repeatedly on these prototype points until sufficient data
reduction has been obtained. Finally, a more sophisticated clustering algorithm
is applied to the reduced prototype points, thereby obtaining a clustering on
all $n$ data points. This entire procedure for clustering is called iterative
hybridized threshold clustering (IHTC). Through simulation results and by
applying our methodology on several real datasets, we show that IHTC combined
with $k$-means or HAC substantially reduces the run time and memory usage of
the original clustering algorithms while still preserving their performance.
Additionally, IHTC helps prevent singular data points from being overfit by
clustering algorithms.

sculpt the agent's objective and its interface to the environment. These
inductive biases can take many forms, including domain knowledge and pretuned
hyper-parameters. In general, there is a trade-off between generality and
performance when algorithms use such biases. Stronger biases can lead to faster
learning, but weaker biases can potentially lead to more general algorithms.
This trade-off is important because inductive biases are not free; substantial
effort may be required to obtain relevant domain knowledge or to tune
hyper-parameters effectively. In this paper, we re-examine several
domain-specific components that bias the objective and the environmental
interface of common deep reinforcement learning agents. We investigated whether
the performance deteriorates when these components are replaced with adaptive
solutions from the literature. In our experiments, performance sometimes
decreased with the adaptive components, as one might expect when comparing to
components crafted for the domain, but sometimes the adaptive components
performed better. We investigated the main benefit of having fewer
domain-specific components, by comparing the learning performance of the two
systems on a different set of continuous control problems, without additional
tuning of either system. As hypothesized, the system with adaptive components
performed better on many of the new tasks.

Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Japan, to
quantitatively compare the performance of today's operational solar flare
forecasting facilities. Building upon Paper I of this series (Barnes et al.
2016), in Paper II (Leka et al. 2019) we described the participating methods
for this latest comparison effort, the evaluation methodology, and presented
quantitative comparisons. In this paper we focus on the behavior and
performance of the methods when evaluated in the context of broad
implementation differences. Acknowledging the short testing interval available
and the small number of methods available, we do find that forecast
performance: 1) appears to improve by including persistence or prior flare
activity, region evolution, and a human ""forecaster in the loop""; 2) is hurt by
restricting data to disk-center observations; 3) may benefit from long-term
statistics, but mostly when then combined with modern data sources and
statistical approaches. These trends are arguably weak and must be viewed with
numerous caveats, as discussed both here and in Paper II. Following this
present work, we present in Paper IV a novel analysis method to evaluate
temporal patterns of forecasting errors of both types (i.e., misses and false
alarms; Park et al. 2019). Hence, most importantly, with this series of papers
we demonstrate the techniques for facilitating comparisons in the interest of
establishing performance-positive methodologies.

interactions mediated by a spin 1 particle, we find two DM-nucleon interaction
operators arising from the non-relativistic reduction of simplified models for
spin 1 DM that are specific to spin 1 DM, and which were not considered in
previous studies. They are quadratic in the momentum transfer, linear in a
symmetric combination of polarisation vectors for the DM particle, and arise
from simplified models which do not generate momentum transfer independent
operators as leading interactions in the non-relativistic expansion of
DM-nucleon scattering amplitudes. Within these simplified models, the new
operators cannot be neglected when computing DM signals at direct detection
experiments. For example, we find that nuclear recoil energy spectra computed
by including or neglecting the new operators can differ by up to one order of
magnitude for nuclear recoil energies larger than about 20 keV and DM masses
below $50$ GeV. Furthermore, the shape of the expected nuclear recoil spectra
depends significantly on whether the new operators are taken into account or
not. Finally, neglecting the contribution to DM direct detection signals from
the new operators leads to inaccurate conclusions when assessing the
compatibility of a future direct detection signal with CMB constraints on the
DM relic density, especially when the number of signal events is small, e.g.
$\mathcal{O}(1)$.

gives rise not only to multiple equivalent global minima of the loss function,
but also to first-order saddle points located on the path between the global

1, \ldots, d$, we construct smooth paths between equivalent global minima that
lead through a `permutation point' where the input and output weight vectors of
two neurons in the same hidden layer $k$ collide and interchange. We show that
such permutation points are critical points with at least $n_{k+1}$ vanishing
eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of second derivatives indicating a local
plateau of the loss function. We find that a permutation point for the exchange
of neurons $i$ and $j$ transits into a flat valley (or generally, an extended
plateau of $n_{k+1}$ flat dimensions) that enables all $n_k!$ permutations of
neurons in a given layer $k$ at the same loss value. Moreover, we introduce
high-order permutation points by exploiting the recursive structure in neural
network functions, and find that the number of $K^{\text{th}}$-order
permutation points is at least by a factor
$\sum_{k=1}^{d-1}\frac{1}{2!^K}{n_k-K \choose K}$ larger than the (already
huge) number of equivalent global minima. In two tasks, we illustrate
numerically that some of the permutation points correspond to first-order
saddles (`permutation saddles'): first, in a toy network with a single hidden

worst-case scenario of an uncertain parameter and, in its basic form, is
sometimes criticized for producing overly-conservative solutions. To reduce the
level of conservatism in RO, one can use the well-known budget-of-uncertainty
approach which limits the amount of uncertainty to be considered in the model.
In this paper, we study a class of problems with resource uncertainty and
propose a robust optimization methodology that produces solutions that are even
less conservative than the conventional budget-of-uncertainty approach. We
propose a new tractable two-stage robust optimization approach that identifies
the ""ineffective"" parts of the uncertainty set and optimizes for the
""effective"" worst-case scenario only. In the first stage, we identify the
effective range of the uncertain parameter, and in the second stage, we provide
a formulation that eliminates the unnecessary protection for the ineffective
parts, and hence, produces less conservative solutions and provides intuitive
insights on the trade-off between robustness and solution conservatism. We
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach using a power dispatch
optimization problem with wind uncertainty. We also provide examples of other
application areas that would benefit from the proposed approach.

We then formulate the traceless version of $f(R)$ gravity, and we find that a

scale-invariant form: $V(\phi )=\frac{D-2}{4D}Re^{-\phi }$, where $\phi

mere integration constant, statistically distributed in a multiverse of
independent causal domains, the vacuum energy is another unrelated arbitrary
constant, and the same is true of the height of the inflationary plateau
present in a huge variety of potentials. Unlike in the conformal equivalent of
full general relativity, flat potentials are found to be possible in all
spacetime dimensions for polynomial lagrangians of all orders. Hence, we are
led to a novel interpretation of the cosmological constant vacuum energy

the way people move in cities around the world and are often considered a
convenient alternative to public transit, since they offer higher Quality of
Service (QoS - less waiting time, door-to-door service) at a cheap price. In
the next decades, these advantages are expected to be further amplified by
Automated MoD (AMoD), in which drivers will be replaced by automated vehicles,
with a big gain in terms of cost-efficiency. MoD is usually intended as a
door-to-door service. However, there has been recent interest toward
consolidating, e.g., aggregating, the travel demand by limiting the number of
admitted stop locations. This implies users have to walk from/to their intended
origin/destination.
  The contribution of this paper is a systematic study the impact of
consolidation on the operator cost and on user QoS. We introduce a MoD system
where pick-ups and drop-offs can only occur in a limited subset of admitted
stop locations. The density of such locations is a system parameter: the less
the density, the more the user demand is consolidated. We show that, by
decreasing stop density, we can increase system capacity (number of passengers
we are able to serve). On the contrary, increasing it, we can improve QoS. The
system is tested in AMoDSim, an open-source simulator. The code to reproduce
the results presented here is available on-line.
  This work is a first step toward flexible mobility services that are able to
autonomously re-configure themselves, favoring capacity or QoS, depending on
the amount of travel demand coming from users. In other words, the services we
envisage in this work shift their operational mode to any intermediate point in
the range from a taxi-like door-to-door service to a bus-like service, with few
served stops and more passengers on-board.

stellar associations (100-200 pc and smaller), the velocity of star formation
propagation is almost constant and it has a typical value of a few km/s.

bound states can be realized and manipulated to perform qubit operations, we
propose a topological Josephson junction architecture that achieves these

conventional superconducting electrodes deposited on a topological insulator
film to form networks of proximity-coupled lateral Josephson junctions.
Magnetic fields threading the network of junction barriers create Josephson
vortices that host Majorana bound states localized in the junction where the
local phase difference is an odd multiple of $\pi$, i.e. attached to the cores
of the Josephson vortices. This enables us to manipulate the Majorana states by
moving the Josephson vortices, achieving functionality exclusive to these
systems in contrast to others, such as those composed of topological
superconductor nanowires. We describe protocols for: 1) braiding localized
Majorana states by exchange, 2) controlling the separation and hence the
coupling of adjacent localized Majorana states to effect non-Abelian rotations
via hybridization of the Majorana modes, and 3) reading out changes in the
non-local parity correlations induced by such operations. These schemes make
use of the application of current pulses and local magnetic field pulses to
control the location of vortices, and measurements of the Josephson
current-phase relation to reveal the presence of the Majorana bound states. We
describe the architecture and schemes in the context of experiments currently
underway.

stochastic environments characterized by sudden changes. We show that exact
Bayesian inference in a hierarchical model gives rise to a surprise-modulated
trade-off between forgetting old observations and integrating them with the new
ones. The modulation depends on a probability ratio, which we call ""Bayes
Factor Surprise"", that tests the prior belief against the current belief. We
demonstrate that in several existing approximate algorithms the Bayes Factor
Surprise modulates the rate of adaptation to new observations. We derive three
novel surprised-based algorithms, one in the family of particle filters, one in
the family of variational learning, and the other in the family of message
passing, that have constant scaling in observation sequence length and
particularly simple update dynamics for any distribution in the exponential
family. Empirical results show that these surprise-based algorithms estimate
parameters better than alternative approximate approaches and reach levels of
performance comparable to computationally more expensive algorithms. The Bayes
Factor Surprise is related to but different from Shannon Surprise. In two
hypothetical experiments, we make testable predictions for physiological
indicators that dissociate the Bayes Factor Surprise from Shannon Surprise. The
theoretical insight of casting various approaches as surprise-based learning,
as well as the proposed online algorithms, may be applied to the analysis of
animal and human behavior, and to reinforcement learning in non-stationary

macroscopic superconducting circuits into artificial atoms, enabling some of
the best controlled quantum bits (qubits) today. Three fundamental types of
superconducting qubits are known, each reflecting a distinct behavior of
quantum fluctuations in a Cooper pair condensate: single charge tunneling
(charge qubit), single flux tunneling (flux qubit), and phase oscillations
(phase qubit). Yet, the dual nature of charge and flux suggests that circuit
atoms must come in pairs. Here we introduce the missing one, named ""blochnium"".
It exploits a coherent insulating response of a single Josephson junction that
emerges from the extension of phase fluctuations beyond the $2\pi$-interval.
Evidence for such effect was found in an out-of-equilibrium dc-transport
through junctions connected to high-impedance leads, although a full consensus
is absent to date. We shunt a weak junction with an exceptionally high-value
inductance -- the key technological innovation behind our experiment -- and
measure the rf-excitation spectrum as a function of external magnetic flux
through the resulting loop. The junction's insulating character manifests by
the vanishing flux-sensitivity of the qubit transition between the ground and
the first excited states, which nevertheless rapidly recovers for transitions
to higher energy states. The spectrum agrees with a duality mapping of
blochnium onto transmon, which replaces the external flux by the offset charge
and introduces a new collective quasicharge variable in place of the
superconducting phase. Our result unlocks the door to an unexplored regime of
macroscopic quantum dynamics in ultrahigh-impedance circuits, which may have
applications to quantum computing and quantum metrology of direct current.

cross-modality transfer exploits concurrently captured CF and fundus FA images.
Binary vessels maps are first detected from CF images with a pre-trained neural
network and then are geometrically registered with and transferred to FA images
via robust parametric chamfer alignment to a preliminary FA vessel detection
obtained with an unsupervised technique. Using the transferred vessels as
initial ground truth labels for deep learning, the human-in-the-loop approach
progressively improves the quality of the ground truth labeling by iterating
between deep-learning and labeling. The approach significantly reduces manual

Yukawa couplings with $\textbf{10} \oplus \textbf{120}$ Higgs fields, whereas
the right-handed (RH) neutrino Majorana masses are generated via the Witten
mechanism. The gauge coupling unification is achieved together with a unique
pattern of the fermion masses and mixing at the grand unification scale due to
additional contributions of vector-like quarks to the standard model
renormalization group equations. We perform the fitting of the model to the
experimental data of charged fermion masses and the CKM matrix. The best fit
point is obtained with large pulls for $m_c$, $m_s$, $m_b$, and $m_\tau$. For
the modifications to the minimal model by adding either $\textbf{10}'$ or
$\textbf{120}'$, a large deviation for the tau mass rules out all these models.
In the case with the bottom and vector-like quark mixing, the mass matrices are
well fitted the charged fermions but the bound on the light neutrino mass scale
excludes this scenario. To ameliorate this deficit, we consider the two-step
symmetry breaking scenario, $SO(10) \rightarrow SU(5) \rightarrow SU(3)_C
\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, with the $SO(10)$ breaking at the Planck scale
leading to the radiatively generated RH neutrino Majorana masses being at the
ordinary seesaw scale. For this case, we find the best fit point with $\chi^2 =
7.8$ consistent with experimental results including the neutrino sector. The
largest deviation is 2.3$\sigma$ corresponding to the strange quark mass.
Hence, a more precise determination of the strange quark mass can test this
model. For the best fit point, we find the effective Majorana neutrino mass of
$m_{\beta\beta} = 0.22$ meV and the sum of light neutrino masses as $\Sigma =
0.078$ eV, which are consistent with the current constraints from the search
for the neutrinoless double beta decay and the CMB anisotropy measurement.

coolant in primordial gas and provide estimates of cold dense gas at the onset
of star formation. To accomplish this goal, we perform three dimensional
cosmological simulations of minihalos in different environments forming at $
z\sim 25$ by varying strength of background UV flux below the Lyman limit
between 0.01-1000 in units of $\rm J_{21}=10^{-21}~erg/cm^2/s/Hz/sr$.
Particularly, we include photo-detachment of $\rm H^-$, the self-shielding of
$\rm H_2$ which both were neglected in previous studies and use updated
reaction rates. Our results show that depending on the background level $\rm
H_2$ formation is suppressed, delaying gravitational collapse until halos reach
the atomic cooling limit. We find that the formation of cold dense molecular
gas and subsequently star formation gets delayed by 100 to 230 Myr depending on
the level of the background radiation and the growth history of the dark matter
halos. The fraction of dense self-shielded gas is a strong function of the
background flux and exponentially declines with the strength of incident UV
flux above $\rm J_{21} \geq 1$. We find that taking into account $\rm H_2$
self-shielding is crucial for accurately estimating the amount of cold dense

on predictive coding, resulting in the recently published CCSDS 123.0-B-2

residuals provides excellent rate-distortion performance for the near-lossless
operating mode, it significantly constrains the achievable throughput due to
data dependencies. In this paper, we study the performance of a faster method
based on prequantization of the image followed by a lossless predictive
compressor. While this is well known to be suboptimal, one can exploit powerful
signal models to reconstruct the image at the ground segment, recovering part
of the suboptimality. In particular, we show that convolutional neural networks

SEDs from the 3D-HST survey. Notably this model uses both nonparametric SFHs
and a flexible dust attenuation curve, both of which have the potential to
`break' the typical correlations observed in UVJ color-color space. Instead,
these fits confirm observed trends between UVJ colors and observed galaxy
properties, including specific star formation rate (sSFR), dust attenuation,
stellar age, and stellar metallicity. They also demonstrate that UVJ colors do
not, on their own, constrain stellar age or metallicity; the observed trends in
the UVJ diagram are instead driven by galaxy scaling relationships and thus
will evolve with cosmological time. We also show that UVJ colors 'saturate'

context of quantum simulation including the original Bravyi-Kitaev Superfast
encoding (OSE) as well as a generalized version (GSE). We return to OSE and
compare it against the Jordan-Wigner (JW) transform for quantum chemistry
considering the number of qubits required, the Pauli weight of terms in the
transformed Hamiltonians, and the $L_1$ norm of the Hamiltonian. We considered
a test set of molecular systems known as the Atomization Energy 6 (AE6) as well
as Hydrogen lattices. Our results showed that the resource efficiency of OSE is
strongly affected by the spatial locality of the underlying single-particle
basis. We find that OSE is outperformed by JW when the orbitals in the
underlying single-particle basis are highly overlapping, which limits its
applicability to near-term quantum chemistry simulations utilizing standard
basis sets. In contrast, when orbitals are overlapping with only few others, as
is the case of Hydrogen lattices with very tight orbitals, OSE fares
comparatively better. Our results illustrate the importance of choosing the
right combination of basis sets and fermion to qubit mapping to get the most
out of a quantum device when simulating physical systems.

in the matter power spectrum between the effects of $f(R)$-gravity and feedback
from active galactic nuclei (AGN), and the imprint of modified gravity on the
properties of galaxies and on the distribution of dark matter, gas and stars in
the universe. $f(R)$-gravity has an observable effect on the neutral hydrogen
power spectrum at high redshift at a level of 20%. For both the F6 and F5
models, this is significantly larger than the predicted errors for the SKA1-MID
survey, making this probe a powerful test of gravity on large scales. A similar
effect is present in the power spectrum of the stars at high redshift. We also
show that rotationally supported disc galaxies can form in $f(R)$-gravity, even
in the partially screened regime. Our simulations indicate that there might be
more disc galaxies in F6 compared to GR, and fewer in F5. Finally, we show that
the back reaction between AGN feedback and modified gravity in the matter power

subsequent ion escape from a Mars sized planet in a global three-dimensional
hybrid simulation. We find that increasing the strength of a planet's magnetic
field enhances ion escape until the magnetic dipole's standoff distance reaches
the induced magnetosphere boundary. After this point increasing the planetary
magnetic field begins to inhibit ion escape. This reflects a balance between
shielding of the southern hemisphere from ``misaligned"" ion pickup forces and
trapping of escaping ions by an equatorial plasmasphere. Thus, the planetary
magnetic field associated with the peak ion escape rate is critically dependent
on the stellar wind pressure. Where possible we have fit power laws for the

likelihood approach to fit the distribution of O I $\lambda$1302 equivalent
widths in bins of redshift, and from this determine the evolution in number
density of absorbers with $W_{1302} > 0.05$ angstroms. We find that the number
density does not monotonically increase with decreasing redshift, as would
naively be expected from the buildup of metal-enriched circumgalactic gas with
time. The number density over $4.9 < z < 5.7$ is a factor of 1.7--4.1 lower
(68% confidence) than over $5.7 < z < 6.5$, with a lower value at $z < 5.7$
favored with 99% confidence. This decrease suggests that the fraction of metals
in a low-ionization phase is larger at $z \sim 6$ than at lower redshifts.
Absorption from highly ionized metals traced by C IV is also weaker in
higher-redshift O I systems, supporting this picture. The evolution of O I
absorbers implies that metal-enriched circumgalactic gas at $z \sim 6$ is
undergoing an ionization transition driven by a strengthening ultraviolet
background. This in turn suggests that the reionization of the diffuse

performs better than other architectures with traditional convolution, being
the new state of the art for embodied VLN in the low-level action space.

applications has lead to the emergence of different families of event
correlation approaches with a multitude of specialized correlation semantics,
including computation models that support the composition and extension of
different semantics. However, type-safe embeddings of extensible and composable
event patterns into statically-typed general-purpose programming languages have
not been systematically explored so far. Event correlation technology has often
adopted well-known and intuitive notations from database queries, for which
approaches to type-safe embedding do exist. However, we argue in the paper that
these approaches, which are essentially descendants of the work on monadic
comprehensions, are not well-suited for event correlations and, thus, cannot
without further ado be reused/re-purposed for embedding event patterns. To
close this gap we propose PolyJoin, a novel approach to type-safe embedding for
fully polyvariadic event patterns with polymorphic correlation semantics. Our
approach is based on a tagless final encoding with uncurried higher-order
abstract syntax (HOAS) representation of event patterns with n variables, for
arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus, our embedding is defined in terms of the
host language without code generation and exploits the host language type
system to model and type check the type system of the pattern language. Hence,
by construction it impossible to define ill-typed patterns. We show that it is
possible to have a purely library-level embedding of event patterns, in the
familiar join query notation, which is not restricted to monads. PolyJoin is
practical, type-safe and extensible. An implementation of it in pure multicore
OCaml is readily usable.

folding limits the lengths of cellular polypeptide chains. Consequently, many
cellular functions are carried out not by long, isolated proteins, but rather
by multi-protein complexes. Protein complexes themselves do not escape physical
constraints, one of the most important being the difficulty to assemble
reliably in the presence of cellular noise. In order to lay the foundation for
a theory of reliable protein complex assembly, we study here an equilibrium
thermodynamic model of self-assembly that exhibits four distinct assembly
behaviors: diluted protein solution, liquid mixture, ""chimeric assembly"" and
""multifarious assembly"". In the latter regime, different protein complexes can
coexist without forming erroneous chimeric structures. We show that two
conditions have to be fulfilled to attain this regime: (i) the composition of
the complexes needs to be sufficiently heterogeneous, and (ii) the use of the
set of components by the complexes has to be sparse. Our analysis of publicly

Legacy Project. We present the characterisation of the thick discs in a sample
of five edge-on galaxies. A study of the radial and vertical surface brightness
profiles is presented by comparing our data with point spread function (PSF)
deconvolved models. Our method begins with an analysis of the background and
masking processes. Then we consider the effects of the PSF through galaxy
modelling. The galaxy disc components are fitted considering that the thin and
thick discs are two stellar fluids that are gravitationally coupled in
hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that effects due to the PSF are significant
when low surface brightness is reached, especially in the vertical profiles,
but it can be accounted for by careful modelling. The galaxy outskirts are
strongly affected by the faint wings of the PSF, mainly by PSF-redistributed
light from the thin disc. This is a central problem for ultra-deep imaging. The
thick-disc component is required to reach satisfactory fit results in the more
complex galaxies in our sample, although it is not required for all galaxies.
When the PSF is ignored, the brightness of these structures may be
overestimated by up to a factor of $\sim$4. In general, our results are in good
agreement with those of previous works, although we reach deeper surface
brightness levels, so that the PSF effects are stronger. We obtain scale
heights and mass ratios of thin and thick discs ($z_{{\rm t}}$, $z_{{\rm T}}$,
and $M_{{\rm T}}/M_{{\rm t}}$), which provide excellent agreement with previous
studies. Our small initial sample provides evidence for aspects of a wide
variety of formation theories for the thick discs in disc galaxies.

10^9 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z\gtrsim6$, $<1$ Gyr after the Big Bang, are
thought to have been seeded by massive black holes which formed before growing
concurrently with the formation of their host galaxies. We model analytically
the idealised growth of seed black holes, fed through gas inflow from growing
proto-galaxy discs. The inflow depends on the disc gravitational stability and
thus varies with black hole and disc mass. We find that for a typical host
halo, the efficiency of angular momentum transport, as parametrised by the disc
viscosity, is the limiting factor in determining the inflow rate and the black
hole accretion rate. For our fiducial case we find an upper black hole mass
estimate of $M_\bullet \sim 1.8 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ at $z=6$.
Only in the extreme case of $\sim 10^{16}$ M$_{\odot}$ haloes at $z=6$ produces
SMBH masses of $\sim 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$. However, the number density of such
haloes is many orders of magnitude below the estimated 1 Gpc$^{-3}$ of SMBHs at
$z=6$, indicating that viscosity driven accretion is too inefficient to feed
the growth of seeds into $M_\bullet \sim 10^9 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ SMBHs by $z

apparent discrepancy in black hole mass at $z=6$, with some dependence on the
exact choice of orbital parameters of the merger.

surpass blackbody limits on thermal radiation by orders of magnitude due to

transfer beyond planar structures have assumed utility in surface
nanostructuring, which can enhance the density of states, and further assumed
that such design paradigms can approach Landauer limits, in analogy to
conduction. We derive fundamental shape-independent limits to radiative heat
transfer, applicable in near- through far-field regimes, that incorporate
material and geometric constraints such as intrinsic dissipation and finite
object sizes, and show that these preclude reaching the Landauer limits in all
but a few restrictive scenarios. Additionally, we show that the interplay of
material response and electromagnetic scattering among proximate bodies means
that bodies which maximize radiative heat transfer actually maximize scattering

show that these lead to overly optimistic predictions. Our results have

spin transport is diffusive in the easy-axis regime for strong exchange
anisotropies. This finding is based on the combination of numerous signatures,
such as (i) Gaussian spreading of correlations, (ii) a time-independent
diffusion coefficient, (iii) power-law decay of equal-site correlations, (iv)
exponentially decaying long-wavelength modes, and (v) Lorentzian line shapes of

results by additional quantum Monte Carlo simulations of large systems. In
contrast to the easy-axis regime, we show that in the case of an isotropic
chain, the signatures (i) - (v) are much less pronounced or even entirely
absent, suggesting the existence of anomalous spin transport despite the
nonintegrability of the model. Eventually, upon introducing a random on-site
magnetic field, we observe a breakdown of diffusion and distinctly slower

However, if the object has a finite mass, this will create additional curvature
in the spacetime, causing it to deviate from geodesic motion. If the mass is
nonetheless sufficiently small, such an effect is usually treated
perturbatively and is known as the gravitational self-force due to the object.
This issue is still an open problem in gravitational physics today, motivated
not only by basic foundational interest, but also by the need for its direct
application in gravitational-wave astronomy. In particular, the observation of
extreme-mass-ratio inspirals by the future space-based detector LISA will rely
crucially on an accurate modeling of the self-force driving the orbital
evolution and gravitational wave emission of such systems.
  In this paper, we present a novel derivation, based on conservation laws, of
the basic equations of motion for this problem. They are formulated with the
use of a quasilocal (rather than matter) stress-energy-momentum tensor---in
particular, the Brown-York tensor---so as to capture gravitational effects in
the momentum flux of the object, including the self-force. Our formulation and
resulting equations of motion are independent of the choice of the perturbative
gauge. We show that, in addition to the usual gravitational self-force term,
they also lead to an additional ""self-pressure"" force not found in previous
analyses, and also that our results correctly recover known formulas under
appropriate conditions. Our approach thus offers a fresh geometrical picture
from which to understand the self-force fundamentally, and potentially useful
new avenues for computing it practically.

the other hand, mathematicians define resonances as poles of an analytic
continuation of the resolvent operator through complex dilations. A major
challenge is to relate these scattering and resonance theoretical notions,
e.g., to prove that the poles of the resolvent operator induce the above
mentioned peaks in the scattering matrix. In the case of quantum mechanics,
this problem was addressed in numerous works that culminated in Simon's seminal
paper [33] in which a general solution was presented for a large class of pair
potentials. However, in quantum field theory the analogous problem has been
open for several decades despite the fact that scattering and resonance
theories have been well-developed for many models. In certain regimes these
models describe very fundamental phenomena, such as emission and absorption of
photons by atoms, from which quantum mechanics originated. In this work we
present a first non-perturbative formula that relates the scattering matrix to
the resolvent operator in the massless Spin-Boson model. This result can be
seen as a major progress compared to our previous works [13] and [12] in which

geometrical frustration, revealing very different ground states and quantum
effects depending on the nature of anisotropies in the model. Due to strong
spin orbit coupling and crystal field effects, rare-earth ions can form
pseudo-spin-1/2 magnetic moments with anisotropic single-ion and exchange
properties. Thus, rare-earth based triangular lattices enable the exploration
of this interplay between frustration and anisotropy. Here we study one such
case, the rare-earth double vanadate glaserite material K$_3$Er(VO$_4$)$_2$,
which is a quasi-2D isosceles triangular antiferromagnet. Our specific heat and
neutron powder diffraction data from K$_3$Er(VO$_4$)$_2$ reveal a transition to
long range magnetic order at 155 $\pm$ 5 mK which accounts for all R$\ln$2
entropy. The quasi-2D magnetic order leads to anisotropic Warren-like Bragg
peak profiles, and is best described by alternating layers of b-axis aligned
antiferromagnetism and zero moment layers. Our magnetic susceptibility data
reveal that Er$^{3+}$ takes on a strong XY single-ion anisotropy in
K$_3$Er(VO$_4$)$_2$, leading to vanishing moments when pseudo-spins are
oriented along c. Thus, the magnetic structure, when considered from the
pseudo-spin point of view comprises alternating layers of b-axis and c-axis

subsequent accretion of the disrupted debris by that black hole, offers a
direct means to study the inner regions of otherwise-quiescent galaxies. These
tidal disruption events (TDEs) are being discovered at an ever-increasing rate.
We present a model for the evolution of the tidally-disrupted debris from a
partial TDE, in which a stellar core survives the initial tidal encounter and
continues to exert a gravitational influence on the expanding stream of
tidally-stripped debris. We use this model to show that the asymptotic fallback
rate of material to the black hole in a partial TDE scales as $\propto
t^{-2.26\pm0.01}$, and is effectively independent of the mass of the core that
survives the encounter; we also estimate the rate at which TDEs approach this
asymptotic scaling as a function of the core mass. These findings suggest that
the late-time accretion rate onto a black hole from a TDE either declines as
$t^{-5/3}$ if the star is completely disrupted or $t^{-9/4}$ if a core is left
behind. We emphasize that previous investigations have not recovered this
result due to the assumption of a Keplerian energy-period relationship for the
debris orbits, which is no longer valid when a surviving core generates a
time-dependent, gravitational potential. This dichotomy of fallback rates has
important implications for the characteristic signatures of TDEs in the current
era of wide-field surveys.

erroneous impression that something ``wrong'' can happen at the boundaries of

the discrete to the quantum graph case, but which has issues at the Dirichlet

discussion almost 20 years ago which, in spite of the increase in the amount of

the current theories of the early dynamical evolution of the Solar System such
as the environment of formation, initial surface composition, and how (if) they
were scattered to regions closer to the inner planets. In this paper we present
an updated version of our database of absolute colours and relative phase
coefficients for 117 objects. We define the absolute colours as the difference
of the absolute magnitudes $H_V-H_R$, and the relative phase coefficient as the
difference of the slopes of the phase curves $\Delta\beta$. These were obtained
joining our own observations plus data from the literature. The methodology has
been introduced in previous works and here we expand in some interesting
results, in particular the strong anti-correlation found between $H_V-H_R$ and
$\Delta\beta$, which means that redder objects have steeper phase curves in the
R filter, while bluer objects have steeper phase curves in the V filter. We
analyse a series of results published in the literature in view of our
database, which is free of phase effects, and show that their statistical
meaning is not very strong. We point out that phase-colouring and observational

is inherently inscrutable to the extent that it is impossible for a human to
interpret the model directly: they are black box models. This has led to a call
for research on explaining black box models, for which there are two main
approaches. Global explanations that aim to explain a model's decision making
process in general, and local explanations that aim to explain a single
prediction. Since it remains challenging to establish fidelity to black box
models in globally interpretable approximations, much attention is put on local
explanations. However, whether local explanations are able to reliably
represent the black box model and provide useful insights remains an open
question. We present Global Aggregations of Local Explanations (GALE) with the
objective to provide insights in a model's global decision making process.
Overall, our results reveal that the choice of aggregation matters. We find
that the global importance introduced by Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
Explanations (LIME) does not reliably represent the model's global behavior.
Our proposed aggregations are better able to represent how features affect the
model's predictions, and to provide global insights by identifying
distinguishing features.

scalability for dynamic ontology (e.g., movie, restaurant) and unseen slot
values. We focus on a specific condition, where the ontology is unknown to the
state tracker, but the target slot value (except for none and dontcare),
possibly unseen during training, can be found as word segment in the dialogue
context. Prior approaches often rely on candidate generation from n-gram
enumeration or slot tagger outputs, which can be inefficient or suffer from
error propagation. We propose BERT-DST, an end-to-end dialogue state tracker
which directly extracts slot values from the dialogue context. We use BERT as
dialogue context encoder whose contextualized language representations are
suitable for scalable DST to identify slot values from their semantic context.
Furthermore, we employ encoder parameter sharing across all slots with two
advantages: (1) Number of parameters does not grow linearly with the ontology.
(2) Language representation knowledge can be transferred among slots. Empirical
evaluation shows BERT-DST with cross-slot parameter sharing outperforms prior
work on the benchmark scalable DST datasets Sim-M and Sim-R, and achieves
competitive performance on the standard DSTC2 and WOZ 2.0 datasets.

high-throughput and low-latency needs of immersive applications. However, due
to the highly directional nature of the mmWave beams and their susceptibility
to beam misalignment and blockage resulting from user movements and rotations,
the associated mmWave links are vulnerable to large channel fluctuations. These
fluctuations result in disproportionately adverse effects on performance of
transport layer protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). To
overcome this challenge, we propose a network layer solution, COded Taking And
Giving (COTAG) scheme to sustain low-latency and high-throughput end-to-end TCP
performance in dually connected networks. In particular, COTAG creates network
encoded packets at the network gateway and each access point (AP) aiming to
adaptively take the spare bandwidth on each link for transmission. Further, if
one link bandwidth drops due to user movements, COTAG actively abandons the
transmission opportunity by conditionally dropping packets. Consequently, COTAG
actively adapts to link quality changes in mmWave access network and enhances
the TCP performance without jeopardizing the latency of immersive content
delivery. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed COTAG, we conduct
experiments using off-the-shelf APs and network simulations. The evaluation
results show that COTAG improves end-to-end TCP performance significantly on
both throughput and latency.

size of the queried area. In this paper, to improve query efficiency, an
oblivious location-based service query (OLBSQ) scheme is proposed. Our scheme
captures the following features: (1) a semi-trusted TTP is not required; (2) a
user can query services from a service provider without revealing her exact

formalise the definition and security model of OLBSQ schemes. The security of
our scheme is reduced to well-known complexity assumptions. The novelty is to
reduce the computation cost and communication cost of making a query and enable
the service provider to obliviously and incrementally generate decrypt keys for
queried services. This contributes to the growing work of formalising

to learn to imitate human players in video games. However, a major limitation
of current IL approaches is that they learn only a single ""average"" policy
based on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different
types of behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Behavioral
Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of
behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs

network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely
modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human replays to
perform build-order planning in StarCraft II. Principal Component Analysis

high-dimensional army unit composition of each demonstration. The results
demonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express

to adapt the behavior of the policy - in-between games - to reach a performance
beyond that of the traditional IL baseline approach.

that uses a gradient-based algorithm to learn a single delay. Multiple delayed
sinc layers can be used to compensate for a non-stationary delay that is a

remains more stable compared to the hydrate formed as growing into the gas

  effective media with gradient distribution of dielectric function",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between rough surfaces, due to its
widespread presence in engineering practice of near-field energy utilization,
requires indepth studies, especially from the perspective of physical
mechanism. In this paper, an effective multilayer model is built to approach
the NFRHT between random rough surfaces of silicon carbide (SiC). Using the
effective medium theory (EMT), the effective dielectric function of each layer
is obtained, which forms a gradient distribution of dielectric function along
the depth of the medium. The influence of the effective dielectric function on
surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) is analyzed, showing that the effective
layers with small filling fraction of SiC feature lower SPhP resonance
frequencies than SiC bulk. The coupling of SPhPs from the gradient distribution
of dielectric function produces new surface modes that dominates the NFRHT.
Investigation on the effect of root mean square height (RMS height, {\sigma})
reveals that the peaks of local density of states (LDOS) and spectral heat flux
are red-shifted as {\sigma} increases, while the spectral heat flux below the
peak frequency gets larger. This can be attributed to the coupling of SPhPs
inside the rough layer. We also found the total net heat flux between rough
surfaces separated by an average distance exceeds that between smooth plates
and increases with increasing {\sigma}, which offer a new way to enhance NFRHT.
This work provides a reference for the simulation and understanding of the
NFRHT between rough surfaces.

traffic can take any path connecting the source and destination. Emerging
technologies such as segment routing, however, use logical paths going through
a predetermined set of middlepoints. Inspired by this, in this work we
introduce the problem of node-constrained TE, where traffic must go through a
set of middlepoints, and study its theoretical fundamentals. We show that the
general node-constrained TE that constrains the traffic to take paths going
through one or more middlepoints is NP-hard for directed graphs but strongly
polynomial for undirected graphs, unveiling a profound dichotomy between the
two cases. We additionally investigate the popular variant of node-constrained
TE that uses shortest paths between middlepoints, and show that the problem can
now be solved in weakly polynomial time for a fixed number of middlepoints. Yet
if we constrain the end-to-end paths to be acyclic, the problem can become
NP-hard. This explains why existing work focuses on the computationally
tractable variant. An important application of our work concerns the
computational complexity of flow centrality, first proposed in 1991 by Freeman
et al. [21]: we show that it is NP-hard for directed but strongly polynomial
for undirected graphs. Finally, we investigate the middlepoint selection
problem in general node-constrained TE. We introduce group flow centrality as a
solution concept for multi-commodity networks, study its complexity, and show
that it is monotone but not submodular for both directed and undirected graphs.
Our work provides a thorough theoretical treatment of node-constrained TE and
its applications.

changes in the quality and yield of food sources across multiple timescales.
Individuals foraging in groups act based on both their private observations and
the opinions of their neighbors. How do these information sources interact in
changing environments? We address this problem in the context of honeybee
swarms, showing inhibitory social interactions help maintain adaptivity and
consensus needed for effective foraging. Individual and social interactions of
a mathematical swarm model shape the nutrition yield of a group foraging from
feeders with temporally switching food quality. Social interactions improve
foraging from a single feeder if temporal switching is fast or feeder quality
is low. When the swarm chooses from multiple feeders, the most effective form
of social interaction is direct switching, whereby bees flip the opinion of
nestmates foraging at lower yielding feeders. Model linearization shows that
effective social interactions increase the fraction of the swarm at the correct
feeder (consensus) and the rate at which bees reach that feeder (adaptivity).
Our mathematical framework allows us to compare a suite of social inhibition
mechanisms, suggesting experimental protocols for revealing effective swarm
foraging strategies in dynamic environments.

quantities in the class of linear relativistic higher-derivative theories of
derived type. In this class of models the wave operator is a polynomial in
another formally self-adjoint operator, while each isometry of space-time gives
rise to the series of symmetries of action functional. If the wave operator is
given by n-th-order polynomial then this series includes n independent entries,
which can be explicitly constructed. The Noether theorem is then used to
construct an n-parameter set of second-rank conserved tensors. The canonical
energy-momentum tensor is included in the series, while the other entries
define independent integrals of motion. The Lagrange anchor concept is applied
to connect the general conserved tensor in the series with the original
space-time translation symmetry. This result is interpreted as existence of
multiple energy-momentum tensors in the class of derived systems. To study
stability we seek for bounded-conserved quantities that are connected with the
time translations. We observe that the derived theory is stable if its wave
operator is defined by a polynomial with simple and real roots. The general

operation during a grid outage. During this period, the RGTI is tied to the
battery-bank of an external UPS based backup power system to augment it with
solar power. Such an operation in off-grid mode without employing communication
with the UPS is challenging, as the control of RGTI must not conflict with the
battery management system of the UPS. The hardware and control design aspects
of this requirement are discussed in this paper. A battery emulation control
scheme is proposed for the RGTI that facilitates seamless functioning of the
RGTI in parallel with the physical UPS battery to reduce its discharge current.
A system-level control scheme for overall operation and power management is
presented to handle the dynamic variations in solar irradiation and UPS loads
during the day, such that the battery discharge burden is minimized. The design
and operation of the proposed RGTI system are independent of the external UPS
and can be integrated with an UPS supplied by any manufacturer. Experimental
results on a 4~kVA hardware setup validate the proposed RGTI concept, its

help traditional cloud computing in meeting scalability demands. Fog computing
makes it possible to fulfill real-time requirements of applications by bringing
more processing, storage, and control power geographically closer to

no standard platform for research and development in a realistic environment,
and this dramatically inhibits innovation and development of fog-based
applications. In response to these challenges, we propose the Fog Development
Kit (FDK). By providing high-level interfaces for allocating computing and
networking resources, the FDK abstracts the complexities of fog computing from
developers and enables the rapid development of fog systems. In addition to
supporting application development on a physical deployment, the FDK supports
the use of emulation tools (e.g., GNS3 and Mininet) to create realistic
environments, allowing fog application prototypes to be built with zero
additional costs and enabling seamless portability to a physical
infrastructure. Using a physical testbed and various kinds of applications
running on it, we verify the operation and study the performance of the FDK.
Specifically, we demonstrate that resource allocations are appropriately
enforced and guaranteed, even amidst extreme network congestion. We also
present simulation-based scalability analysis of the FDK versus the number of

confirm that the intensity profile plays an important role, but now we find
quite stringent constraints consistent with the Kerr hypothesis. The key
differences with respect to our previous study are likely the lower disk
temperature in the Suzaku observation and the higher energy resolution near the
iron line of the Suzaku data. We also apply different RELXILL flavors
(different descriptions of the coronal spectrum and variable disk electron

Our estimator is a hybrid of the modal interval, shorth, and median estimators

novel empirical process theory results that we derive for independent but

estimation for mixtures of radially symmetric distributions, and derive minimax
lower bounds on the expected error of any estimator that is agnostic to the
scales of individual data points. Finally, we describe an extension of our
estimators applicable to linear regression. In the multivariate mean estimation

are predicted in various scenarios, including near-horizon quantum structures,
exotic states of matter in ultracompact stars, and certain deviations from
general relativity. The amplitude and frequency of each echo is modulated by
the photon-sphere barrier of the remnant, which acts as a spin- and
frequency-dependent high-pass filter, decreasing the frequency content of each
subsequent echo. Furthermore, a major fraction of the energy of the echo signal
is contained in low-frequency resonances corresponding to the quasi-normal
modes of the remnant. Motivated by these features, in this work we provide an
analytical gravitational-wave template in the low-frequency approximation
describing the post-merger ringdown and the echo signal of a spinning
ultracompact object. Besides the standard ringdown parameters, the template is
parametrized in terms of only two physical quantities: the reflectivity
coefficient and the compactness of the remnant. We discuss novel effects
related to the spin and to the complex reflectivity, such as a more involved
modulation of subsequent echoes, the mixing of two polarizations, and the
ergoregion instability in case of perfectly-reflecting spinning remnants.
Finally, we compute the errors in the estimation of the template parameters
with current and future gravitational-wave detectors using a Fisher matrix
framework. Our analysis suggests that models with almost perfect reflectivity
can be excluded/detected with current instruments, whereas probing values of
the reflectivity smaller than $80\%$ at $3\sigma$ confidence level requires
future detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, LISA). The template
developed in this work can be easily implemented to perform a matched-filter
based search for echoes and to constrain models of exotic compact objects.

  retrieval method",,,,,"physics.ao-ph eess.IV physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Satellite-based retrieval has become a popular PM2.5 monitoring method
currently. To improve the retrieval performance, multiple variables are usually
introduced as auxiliary variable in addition to aerosol optical depth (AOD).
Different kinds of variables are usually at different resolutions varying from
sub-kilometers to dozens of kilometers. Generally, when doing the retrieval,
variables at different resolutions are resampled to the same resolution as the
AOD product to keep the scale consistency. A deficiency of doing this is that
the information contained in the scale difference is discarded. To fully
utilize the information contained at different scales, a dual-scale retrieval
method is proposed in this study. At the first stage, variables which influence
PM2.5 concentration at large scale were used for PM2.5 retrieval at coarse
resolution. Then at the second stage, variables which affect PM2.5 distribution
in finer scale, were used for the further PM2.5 retrieval at high resolution
(sub-km level resolution) with the retrieved PM2.5 at the first stage at
coarser resolution also as input. In this study, four different retrieval
models including multiple linear regression (MLR), geographically weighted
regression (GWR), random forest (RF) and generalized regression neural network
(GRNN) are adopted to test the performance of the dual-scale retrieval method.
Compared with the traditional retrieval method, the proposed dual-scale
retrieval method can achieve PM2.5 mapping at finer resolution and with higher
accuracy. Dual-scale retrieval can fully utilize the information contained at
different scales, thus achieving a higher resolution and accuracy. It can be
used for the generation of quantitative remote sensing products in various

molecular dynamics (CMD), except that the centroids are averages of
curvilinear, rather than cartesian, bead coordinates. The curvilinear
coordinates are used explicitly only when computing the potential of mean
force, the components of which are re-expressed in terms of cartesian
'quasi-centroids' (so-called because they are close to the cartesian
centroids). Cartesian equations of motion are obtained by making small
approximations to the quantum Boltzmann distribution. Simulations of the
infrared spectra of various water models over 150-600 K show these
approximations to be justified: for a two-dimensional OH-bond model, the
quasi-centroid molecular dynamics (QCMD) spectra lie close to the exact quantum
spectra, and almost on top of the Matsubara dynamics spectra; for gas-phase
water, the QCMD spectra are close to the exact quantum spectra; for liquid
water and ice (using the q-TIP4P/F surface), the QCMD spectra are close to the
CMD spectra at 600 K, and line up with the results of thermostatted
ring-polymer molecular dynamics and approximate quantum calculations at 300 and
150 K. The QCMD spectra show no sign of the CMD 'curvature problem' (of
erroneous red shifts and broadening). In the liquid and ice simulations, the
potential of mean force was evaluated on the fly by generalising an adiabatic
CMD algorithm to curvilinear coordinates; the full limit of adiabatic
separation needed to be taken, which made the QCMD calculations 8 times more
expensive than partially adiabatic CMD at 300 K, and 32 times at 150 K (and the
intensities may still not be converged at this temperature). The QCMD method is
probably generalisable to many other systems, provided collective
bead-coordinates can be identified that yield compact mean-field ring-polymer
distributions.

an intriguing alternative for compressing images and solving inverse problems

realized that even without training, convolutional networks can function as
concise image models, and thus regularize inverse problems. In this paper, we
provide further evidence for this finding by studying variations of
convolutional neural networks that map few weight parameters to an image. The
networks we consider only consist of convolutional operations, with either
fixed or parameterized filters followed by ReLU non-linearities. We demonstrate
that with both fixed and parameterized convolutional filters those networks
enable representing images with few coefficients. What is more, the
underparameterization enables regularization of inverse problems, in particular
recovering an image from few observations. We show that, similar to standard
compressive sensing guarantees, on the order of the number of model parameters
many measurements suffice for recovering an image from compressive
measurements. Finally, we demonstrate that signal recovery with a un-trained
convolutional network outperforms standard l1 and total variation minimization

errors in Neural Networks. Fault Tolerance in Neural Networks is crucial in
real-time safety critical applications requiring computation for long
durations. Neural Networks with high regularisation exhibit superior fault
tolerance, however, at the cost of classification accuracy. In the view of
difference in functionality, a Neural Network is modelled as two separate
networks, i.e, the Feature Extractor with unsupervised learning objective and
the Classifier with a supervised learning objective. Traditional approaches of
training the entire network using a single supervised learning objective is
insufficient to achieve the objectives of the individual components optimally.
In this work, a novel multi-criteria objective function, combining unsupervised
training of the Feature Extractor followed by supervised tuning with Classifier
Network is proposed. The unsupervised training solves two games simultaneously
in the presence of adversary neural networks with conflicting objectives to the
Feature Extractor. The first game minimises the loss in reconstructing the
input image for indistinguishability given the features from the Extractor, in
the presence of a generative decoder. The second game solves a minimax
constraint optimisation for distributional smoothening of feature space to
match a prior distribution, in the presence of a Discriminator network. The
resultant strongly regularised Feature Extractor is combined with the
Classifier Network for supervised fine-tuning. The proposed Adversarial Fault
Tolerant Neural Network Training is scalable to large networks and is
independent of the architecture. The evaluation on benchmarking datasets:
FashionMNIST and CIFAR10, indicates that the resultant networks have high
accuracy with superior tolerance to stuck at ""0"" faults compared to widely used
regularisers.

shared vector space by capturing semantic similarities across languages. They
are a crucial component for scaling tasks to multiple languages by transferring
knowledge from languages with rich resources to low-resource languages. A
common approach to learning cross-lingual embeddings is to train monolingual
embeddings separately for each language and learn a linear projection from the
monolingual spaces into a shared space, where the mapping relies on a small
seed dictionary. While there are high-quality generic seed dictionaries and
pre-trained cross-lingual embeddings available for many language pairs, there
is little research on how they perform on specialised tasks. In this paper, we
investigate the best practices for constructing the seed dictionary for a
specific domain. We evaluate the embeddings on the sequence labelling task of
Curriculum Vitae parsing and show that the size of a bilingual dictionary, the
frequency of the dictionary words in the domain corpora and the source of data
(task-specific vs generic) influence the performance. We also show that the
less training data is available in the low-resource language, the more the
construction of the bilingual dictionary matters, and demonstrate that some of

content image using the visual style of arbitrary reference images, including
both artistic and photorealistic stylization. Given a pair of images as the
source of content and the reference of style, existing solutions usually first
train an auto-encoder (AE) to reconstruct the image using deep features and
then embeds pre-defined style transfer modules into the AE reconstruction
procedure to transfer the style of the reconstructed image through modifying
the deep features. While existing methods typically need multiple rounds of
time-consuming AE reconstruction for better stylization, our work intends to
design novel neural network architectures on top of AE for fast style transfer
with fewer artifacts and distortions all in one pass of end-to-end inference.
To this end, we propose two network architectures named ArtNet and PhotoNet to
improve artistic and photo-realistic stylization, respectively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ArtNet generates images with fewer artifacts and
distortions against the state-of-the-art artistic transfer algorithms, while
PhotoNet improves the photorealistic stylization results by creating sharp
images faithfully preserving rich details of the input content. Moreover,
ArtNet and PhotoNet can achieve 3X to 100X speed-up over the state-of-the-art
algorithms, which is a major advantage for large content images.

analysis and hidden-Markov models, in order to be able to predict which parts
of a gene correspond to a protein encoding area. In this paper, a semi-Markov
model is applied to 3-base periodic sequences, which characterize the

bricks and mortar. We used hydrophilic silica particles, which were partially
hydrophobized by the adsorption of potassium oleate to enable them to stabilize
Pickering emulsions. Various polymers were tested to select the most
appropriate one. The procedure of encapsulation is simple and includes single
homogenization by ultrasound. The produced capsules are pH responsive. They are
stable in aqueous phase of pH in the range 3-6, but at pH>6 they are
destabilized and their cargo is released. With the optimized formulation of
silica particles, polymer, oleate and NaCl, we were able to encapsulate various
oils and fragrances, such as tetradecane, limonene, benzyl salicylate and
citronellol. All of them have a limited and not too high solubility in water.
In contrast, no stable microcapsules were obtained with oils that either have
zero water solubility (mineral and silicone oil) or higher water solubility

interfacial-tension and thin-film experiments, we concluded that a key factor
for obtaining stable capsules is the irreversible adsorption of the polymer at
the oil/water interface. The hydrophobization of the particles by surfactant

enlarge receptive field which has the advantage of low computational

to further operations such as features extraction and analysis. Recently,
dilated filter has been proposed to trade off between receptive field size and

input images with checkerboard patterns. To address this problem, in this
paper, we propose a novel multi-level wavelet CNN (MWCNN) model to achieve
better trade-off between receptive field size and computational efficiency. The
core idea is to embed wavelet transform into CNN architecture to reduce the
resolution of feature maps while at the same time, increasing receptive field.
Specifically, MWCNN for image restoration is based on U-Net architecture, and
inverse wavelet transform (IWT) is deployed to reconstruct the high resolution

dilated filter and a generalization of average pooling, and can be applied to
not only image restoration tasks, but also any CNNs requiring a pooling

large quantity of both theoretical and practical studies in combinatorial
optimization. Although the problem has been investigated under various settings
reflecting typical structures within the optimization problems of practical
interest, little is known on how the problem behaves in conjunction with parity
constraints. This shortfall of understanding was rather disturbing when we
consider the central role of parity in the field of combinatorics. In this
paper, we present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the
facility location problem with parity constraints. We are given as the input a
metric on a set of facilities and clients, the opening cost of each facility,
and the parity requirement--odd, even, or unconstrained--of every facility in
this problem. The objective is to open a subset of facilities and assign every
client to an open facility so as to minimize the sum of the total opening costs
and the assignment distances, but subject to the condition that the number of
clients assigned to each open facility must have the same parity as its
requirement.
  Although the unconstrained facility location problem as a relaxation for this
parity-constrained generalization has unbounded gap, we demonstrate that it
yields a structured solution whose parity violation can be corrected at small
cost. This correction is prescribed by a T-join on an auxiliary graph
constructed by the algorithm. This graph does not satisfy the triangle
inequality, but we show that a carefully chosen set of shortcutting operations
leads to a cheap and sparse T-join. Finally, we bound the correction cost by
exhibiting a combinatorial multi-step construction of an upper bound. We also
present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the

and ensure user fairness, we maximize the minimum decoding
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (i.e., equivalently the rate) of all
users, by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming at the base
station (BS) and the phase shifts (i.e., passive beamforming) at the IRS. A
combined-channel-strength based user ordering scheme is first proposed to
decouple the user-ordering design and the joint beamforming design. Efficient
algorithms are further proposed to solve the formulated non-convex problem for
the cases of a single-antenna BS and a multi-antenna BS, respectively, by
leveraging the block coordinated decent and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
techniques. For the single-antenna BS case, the optimal solution for the power
allocation at the BS and the asymptotically optimal solution for the phase
shifts at the IRS are obtained in closed forms. For the multi-antenna BS case,
it is shown that the rank of the SDR solution to the transmit beamforming
design is upper bounded by two. Also, the convergence proof and the complexity
analysis are given for the proposed algorithms. Simulation results show that
the IRS-assisted downlink NOMA system can enhance the rate performance
significantly, compared to traditional NOMA without IRS and traditional
orthogonal multiple access with/without IRS. In addition, numerical results
demonstrate that the rate degradation due to the IRS's finite phase resolution

time. In the first part, a modelling framework is introduced aiming for
describing such processes as generalized gradient flows requiring choices of
physical states, corresponding energies, dissipation potentials and external
work rates. It is demonstrated that various existing models can be in fact
written within this framework. Ultimately, the particular structure allows for
a unified well-posedness analysis performed for different classes of linear and
non-linear models. In the second part, the gradient flow structures are
utilized for constructing efficient discrete approximation schemes for
thermo-poro-visco-elasticity -- in particular robust, physical splitting
schemes. Applying alternating minimization to naturally arising minimization
formulations of (semi-)discrete models is proposed. For such, the energy
decrease per iteration is quantified by applying abstract convergence theory
only utilizing convexity and Lipschitz continuity properties of the problem --
a fairly simple but flexible machinery. By this approach, e.g., the widely used
undrained and fixed-stress splits for the linear Biot equations are derived and
analyzed. By application of the framework to more advanced models, novel
splitting schemes with guaranteed theoretical convergence rates are naturally
derived. Moreover, based on the minimization character of the (semi-)discrete
equations, relaxation of splitting schemes by line search is proposed;
numerical results show a potentially great impact on the acceleration of
splitting schemes for both linear and nonlinear problems.

we wish to transfer information from observations to a model of the processes

the model is usually constructed using other strategies. In this paper, we
develop a systematic formulation based on Monte Carlo sampling to achieve such
information transfer. Following the derivation of an appropriate target
distribution, we present the formulation based on the standard
Metropolis-Hasting (MH) procedure and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method
for performing the high dimensional integrals that appear. To the extensive
literature on MH and HMC, we add (1) an annealing method using a hyperparameter
that governs the precision of the model to identify and explore the highest
probability regions of phase space dominating those integrals, and (2) a
strategy for initializing the state space search. The efficacy of the proposed
formulation is demonstrated using a nonlinear dynamical model with chaotic
solutions widely used in geophysics.

AutoCompress, an automatic structured pruning framework with the following key
performance improvements: (i) effectively incorporate the combination of
structured pruning schemes in the automatic process; (ii) adopt the
state-of-art ADMM-based structured weight pruning as the core algorithm, and
propose an innovative additional purification step for further weight reduction
without accuracy loss; and (iii) develop effective heuristic search method
enhanced by experience-based guided search, replacing the prior deep
reinforcement learning technique which has underlying incompatibility with the
target pruning problem. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets
demonstrate that AutoCompress is the key to achieve ultra-high pruning rates on
the number of weights and FLOPs that cannot be achieved before. As an example,
AutoCompress outperforms the prior work on automatic model compression by up to
33x in pruning rate (120x reduction in the actual parameter count) under the
same accuracy. Significant inference speedup has been observed from the
AutoCompress framework on actual measurements on smartphone. We release all

based on a min-rule. Under standard assumptions on the observation model and
the network structure, we establish that each agent learns the truth
asymptotically almost surely. As our main contribution, we prove that with
probability 1, each false hypothesis is ruled out by every agent exponentially
fast at a network-independent rate that is strictly larger than existing rates.
We then develop a computationally-efficient variant of our learning rule that
is provably resilient to agents who do not behave as expected (as represented
by a Byzantine adversary model) and deliberately try to spread misinformation.

the Hubble radius during inflation can be smaller in WI than in CI. In
particular, we find that this depends on how large is the dissipation in WI,
with the amount of required e-folds decreasing with the increasing of the

analysis for the considered WI models, we find good agreement of the model with

level cooperation in large groups, and is a tool applied in management training
exercises. Each player, initially given two colored poker chips, is allowed to
make exchanges with the game coordinator according to two rules, and must
secure a domino before time is called in order to `survive'. Though the rules
are simple, it is not evident by their form that the survival of the entire
group requires that they cooperate at a high level. From the point of view of
the game coordinator, the difficulty of the game for the group can be
controlled not only by the time limit, but also by the initial distribution of
chips, in a way we make precise by a time complexity type argument. That
analysis also provides insight into good strategies for group survival, those
taking the least amount of time. In addition, coordinators may also want to be
aware of when the game is `solvable', that is, when their initial distribution
of chips permits the survival of all group members if given sufficient time to
make exchanges. It turns out that the game is solvable if and only if the
initial distribution contains seven chips that have one of two particular color
distributions. In addition to being a lively game to play in management
training or classroom settings, the analysis of the game after play can make
for an engaging exercise in any basic discrete mathematics course to give a
basic introduction to elements of game theory, logical reasoning, number theory

in the reflected beam generally exhibits modulations as a function of the
vicinal terrace size and shows peaks at those energies that access the image

ion-survival as a function of the particular substrate selection as well as the

examined. A square well model producing standing waves between the steps on the

difference equation (FBS{\Delta}E) and the second one is described by a fully
coupled FBS{\Delta}E. By adopting an appropriate representation of the product
rule and an appropriate formulation of the backward stochastic difference
equation (BS{\Delta}E), we deduce the adjoint difference equation. Finally, the
maximum principle for this optimal control problem with the control domain
being convex is established.

characteristic line for the interface bending stiffness parameters is
presented, near which the stress concentration becomes quite severe. Finally,
the derived analytical solution with the Steigmann-Ogden interface model is

Such interactive data gathering commonly leads to divergence towards dangerous

measures are taken. Prior works proposed bounding the information loss measured
by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence at every policy improvement step to
eliminate instability in the learning dynamics. In this paper, we consider a
broader family of $f$-divergences, and more concretely $\alpha$-divergences,
which inherit the beneficial property of providing the policy improvement step
in closed form at the same time yielding a corresponding dual objective for
policy evaluation. Such entropic proximal policy optimization view gives a
unified perspective on compatible actor-critic architectures. In particular,
common least-squares value function estimation coupled with advantage-weighted
maximum likelihood policy improvement is shown to correspond to the Pearson
$\chi^2$-divergence penalty. Other actor-critic pairs arise for various choices
of the penalty-generating function $f$. On a concrete instantiation of our
framework with the $\alpha$-divergence, we carry out asymptotic analysis of the
solutions for different values of $\alpha$ and demonstrate the effects of the

a generic basic model that measures the cost of healthcare provision based on
given parameters, such as NHS and private healthcare providers' cost of
investments in both sectors, cost of treatments and gained benefits. A
patient's costly punishment is introduced as a mechanism to enhance cooperation
among the three populations. Our findings show that cooperation can be improved
with the introduction of punishment (patient's punishment) against defecting
providers. Although punishment increases cooperation, it is very costly
considering the small improvement in cooperation in comparison to the basic
model.

  Patient Phenotyping",,,,,"cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual summarization of clinical data collected on patients contained within
the electronic health record (EHR) may enable precise and rapid triage at the
time of patient presentation to an emergency department (ED). The triage
process is critical in the appropriate allocation of resources and in
anticipating eventual patient disposition, typically admission to the hospital
or discharge home. EHR data are high-dimensional and complex, but offer the
opportunity to discover and characterize underlying data-driven patient
phenotypes. These phenotypes will enable improved, personalized therapeutic
decision making and prognostication. In this work, we focus on the challenge of
two-dimensional patient projections. A low dimensional embedding offers visual
interpretability lost in higher dimensions. While linear dimensionality
reduction techniques such as principal component analysis are often used
towards this aim, they are insufficient to describe the variance of patient
data. In this work, we employ the newly-described non-linear embedding
technique called uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). UMAP
seeks to capture both local and global structures in high-dimensional data. We
then use Gaussian mixture models to identify clusters in the embedded data and
use the adjusted Rand index (ARI) to establish stability in the discovery of
these clusters. This technique is applied to five common clinical chief
complaints from a real-world ED EHR dataset, describing the emergent properties
of discovered clusters. We observe clinically-relevant cluster attributes,
suggesting that visual embeddings of EHR data using non-linear dimensionality
reduction is a promising approach to reveal data-driven patient phenotypes. In
the five chief complaints, we find between 2 and 6 clusters, with the peak mean
pairwise ARI between subsequent training iterations to range from 0.35 to 0.74.

  Radiative Cooling",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Through passively emitting excess heat to the outer space, radiative cooling
has been demonstrated as an efficient way for energy saving applications.
Selective surface with unity emittance only within the atmospheric window as
well as zero absorption within the solar spectrum is sought to achieve the best
sub-ambient radiative cooling performance during the daytime. In this work, we
proposed a bulk radiative cooler consisting of a 1-mm-thick lithium fluoride
crystal coated with silver backing, which exhibits a solar absorptance of 4.7%
and nearly ideal infrared selectivity with high emission exactly within the
atmospheric transmission band (i.e., 8-13 um). Excellent daytime cooling
performance was demonstrated in an outdoor test with stagnation temperature
below the ambient temperature by 5 K under solar irradiance above 900 W/m2 and
a net cooling power of about 60 W/m2 when the cooler is in thermal equilibrium
with the ambient. As a bulk material with the highest ultraviolet-visible-near
infrared transmittance, lithium fluoride crystal has been widely employed as
the optical windows and mirrors in various applications. The proposed simple
selective infrared emitter based on lithium fluoride would open up an
innovative way to radiatively cool optical systems.
