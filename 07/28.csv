processing. However, many solid-state qubits with favorable properties lack the
single-shot readout capability. One solution is to use the repetitive
quantum-non-demolition readout technique, where the qubit is correlated with an
ancilla, which is subsequently read out. The readout fidelity is therefore
limited by the back-action on the qubit from the measurement. Traditionally, a
threshold method is taken, where only the total photon count is used to
discriminate qubit state, discarding all the information of the back-action
hidden in the time trace of repetitive readout measurement. Here we show by
using machine learning (ML), one obtains higher readout fidelity by taking
advantage of the time trace data. ML is able to identify when back-action
happened, and correctly read out the original state. Since the information is
already recorded (but usually discarded), this improvement in fidelity does not
consume additional experimental time, and could be directly applied to
preparation-by-measurement and quantum metrology applications involving
repetitive readout.

interpolator with tuned smearing width. Using the clover discretization of the
field strength tensor, a calculation using a fixed linear combination of
standard and hybrid interpolators can be done using the same number of quark

find that such an interpolator, optimized by solving a generalized eigenvalue

the effect in three-point correlators, which are needed for computing nucleon
matrix elements, is mixed: for some matrix elements such as the tensor charge,
excited-state effects are suppressed, whereas for others such as the axial
charge, they are enhanced. The results illustrate that the variational method
is not guaranteed to reduce the net contribution from excited states except in

clusters, as they originate from the merger of two stars. Consequently, they
experience dynamical friction, progressively sinking to the cluster center.
Recently, several indicators of the degree of dynamical relaxation of a
globular cluster have been proposed, based on the observed radial distribution
of blue straggler stars. The most successful is the Alessandrini indicator, or
A+ for short, which is the integral of the cumulative distribution of the blue
straggler stars minus that of a lighter reference population. A+ correlates
with the dynamical age of a cluster both in realistic simulations and in
observations. Here I calculate the temporal dependence of the A+ indicator
analytically in a simplified model of the evolution of the blue straggler star
distribution under dynamical friction only.

non-negative (as expected based on monotonicity) due to the density of

non-decreasing with time, making the A$+$ indicator a convex function.

  Embedding","14 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning topological representation of a network in dynamic environments has
recently attracted considerable attention due to the time-evolving nature of
many real-world networks i.e. nodes/links might be added/removed as time goes
on. Dynamic network embedding aims to learn low dimensional embeddings for
unseen and seen nodes by using any currently available snapshots of a dynamic
network. For seen nodes, the existing methods either treat them equally
important or focus on the $k$ most affected nodes at each time step. However,
the former solution is time-consuming, and the later solution that relies on
incoming changes may lose the global topology---an important feature for
downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic network
embedding method called DynWalks, which includes two key components: 1) An
online network embedding framework that can dynamically and efficiently learn
embeddings based on the selected nodes; 2) A novel online node selecting scheme
that offers the flexible choices to balance global topology and recent changes,
as well as to fulfill the real-time constraint if needed. The empirical studies
on six real-world dynamic networks under three different slicing ways show that
DynWalks significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in graph
reconstruction tasks, and obtains comparable results in link prediction tasks.
Furthermore, the wall-clock time and complexity analysis demonstrate its
excellent time and space efficiency. The source code of DynWalks is available

requiring computationally feasible inference schemes. We introduce
Max-and-Smooth, an approximate Bayesian inference scheme for a flexible class
of latent Gaussian models (LGMs) where one or more of the likelihood parameters
are modeled by latent additive Gaussian processes. Max-and-Smooth consists of
two-steps. In the first step (Max), the likelihood function is approximated by
a Gaussian density with mean and covariance equal to either (a) the maximum
likelihood estimate and the inverse observed information, respectively, or (b)
the mean and covariance of the normalized likelihood function. In the second
step (Smooth), the latent parameters and hyperparameters are inferred and
smoothed with the approximated likelihood function. The proposed method ensures
that the uncertainty from the first step is correctly propagated to the second
step. Since the approximated likelihood function is Gaussian, the approximate
posterior density of the latent parameters of the LGM (conditional on the
hyperparameters) is also Gaussian, thus facilitating efficient posterior
inference in high dimensions. Furthermore, the approximate marginal posterior
distribution of the hyperparameters is tractable, and as a result, the
hyperparameters can be sampled independently of the latent parameters. In the
case of a large number of independent data replicates, sparse precision
matrices, and high-dimensional latent vectors, the speedup is substantial in
comparison to an MCMC scheme that infers the posterior density from the exact
likelihood function. The proposed inference scheme is demonstrated on one
spatially referenced real dataset and on simulated data mimicking spatial,
temporal, and spatio-temporal inference problems. Our results show that
Max-and-Smooth is accurate and fast.

in learning near-optimal control in complex simulated environments with little
visible information. Rainbow (Q-Learning) and PPO (Policy Optimisation) have
shown outstanding performance in a variety of tasks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and Roboschool test suite. While these algorithms are fundamentally
different, both suffer from high variance, low sample efficiency, and
hyperparameter sensitivity that in practice, make these algorithms a no-go for
critical operations in the industry.
  On the other hand, model-based reinforcement learning focuses on learning the
transition dynamics between states in an environment. If these environment
dynamics are adequately learned, a model-based approach is perhaps the most
sample efficient method for learning agents to act in an environment optimally.
The traits of model-based reinforcement are ideal for real-world environments
where sampling is slow and for mission-critical operations. In the warehouse
industry, there is an increasing motivation to minimise time and to maximise
production. Currently, autonomous agents act suboptimally using handcrafted
policies for significant portions of the state-space.
  In this paper, we present The Dreaming Variational Autoencoder v2 (DVAE-2), a
model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that increases sample efficiency,
hence enable algorithms with low sample efficiency function better in
real-world environments. We introduce Deep Warehouse, a simulated environment
for industry-near testing of autonomous agents in grid-based warehouses.
Finally, we illustrate that DVAE-2 improves the sample efficiency for the Deep
Warehouse compared to model-free methods.

to address the problem of matching polarimetric thermal face photos against a
gallery of visible faces. The coupled framework contains two sub-networks, one
dedicated to the visible spectrum and the second sub-network dedicated to the
polarimetric thermal spectrum. Each sub-network is made of a generative
adversarial network (GAN) architecture. We propose a novel Attribute-Guided
Coupled Generative Adversarial Network (AGC-GAN) architecture which utilizes
facial attributes to improve the thermal-to-visible face recognition
performance. The proposed AGC-GAN exploits the facial attributes and leverages
multiple loss functions in order to learn rich discriminative features in a
common embedding subspace. To achieve a realistic photo reconstruction while
preserving the discriminative information, we also add a perceptual loss term
to the coupling loss function. An ablation study is performed to show the
effectiveness of different loss functions for optimizing the proposed method.
Moreover, the superiority of the model compared to the state-of-the-art models
is demonstrated using polarimetric dataset.

checking to develop a new algorithm to search for complex Golay pairs. We
implement this algorithm and use it to perform a complete search for complex
Golay pairs of lengths up to 28. In doing so, we find that complex Golay pairs
exist in the lengths 24 and 26 but do not exist in the lengths 23, 25, 27, and
28. This independently verifies work done by F. Fiedler in 2013 and confirms
the 2002 conjecture of Craigen, Holzmann, and Kharaghani that complex Golay
pairs of length 23 don't exist. Our algorithm is based on the recently proposed
SAT+CAS paradigm of combining SAT solvers with computer algebra systems to
efficiently search large spaces specified by both algebraic and logical
constraints. The algorithm has two stages: first, a fine-tuned computer program
uses functionality from computer algebra systems and numerical libraries to
construct a list containing every sequence which could appear as the first
sequence in a complex Golay pair up to equivalence. Second, a programmatic SAT
solver constructs every sequence (if any) that pair off with the sequences
constructed in the first stage to form a complex Golay pair. This extends work
originally presented at the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic
Computation (ISSAC) in 2018; we discuss and implement several improvements to
our algorithm that enabled us to improve the efficiency of the search and
increase the maximum length we search from length 25 to 28.

vibrational properties of many materials. However, they are inadequate for
modeling structural phase transitions in crystals with potential energy
surfaces that are either strongly anharmonic or no\ n-convex with respect to
collective atomic displacements or homogeneous strains. In this paper we
develop a framework to express highly anharmonic first-principles potential
energy surfaces as polynomials of collective cluster deformati\ ons. We further
adapt the approach to a nonlinear extension of the cluster expansion formalism
through the use of an artificial neural net model. The machine learning models
are trained on a large database of first-principles calculations and are shown
to reproduce the potential energy surface with l\ ow error.

wearable sensors. Our work is unique in that it takes physical and cognitive
limitations of the oracle into account when selecting sensor data to be
annotated by the oracle. Our approach is inspired by human-beings' limited
capacity to respond to external stimulus such as responding to a prompt on
their mobile devices. This capacity constraint is manifested not only in the
number of queries that a person can respond to in a given time-frame but also
in the lag between the time that a query is made and when it is responded to.
We introduce the notion of mindful active learning and propose a computational
framework, called EMMA, to maximize the active learning performance taking
informativeness of sensor data, query budget, and human memory into account. We
formulate this optimization problem, propose an approach to model memory
retention, discuss complexity of the problem, and propose a greedy heuristic to
solve the problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three
publicly available datasets and by simulating oracles with various memory
strengths. We show that the activity recognition accuracy ranges from 21% to
97% depending on memory strength, query budget, and difficulty of the machine
learning task. Our results also indicate that EMMA achieves an accuracy level
that is, on average, 13.5% higher than the case when only informativeness of
the sensor data is considered for active learning. Additionally, we show that
the performance of our approach is at most 20% less than experimental
upper-bound and up to 80% higher than experimental lower-bound. We observe that
mindful active learning is most beneficial when query budget is small and/or
oracle's memory is weak, thus emphasizing contributions of our work in
human-centered mobile health settings and for elderly with cognitive
impairments.

indicated the formation of stable floating Langmuir film at the water subphase.
Atomic Force Microscopy investigation confirmed the successful deposition of
the Langmuir film onto solid substrate. Device consisted of 60 layers LB films
of imidazole showed resistive bipolar switching behaviour irrespective of the
first applied bias voltage polarity. Observed bipolar switching has been
explained in terms of reduction oxidation process. Due to the presence of
strong reducible group C double bond N in the imidazole core, reduction
oxidation process takes place easily during bias. Presence of sharp reduction
and oxidation peaks in the Cyclic Voltammetry measurement of 2 also supported
this hypothesis. Presence of benzyl group with the imidazole core played the
crucial rule in the reduction oxidation process and hence the switching
behaviour. When benzyl group was replaced by a H then bipolar switching was not
observed. In that case oxidizable group NH opposed the reduction process during
bias. This type of bipolar switching is very promising for future technological
applications in organic electronics.

The first algorithm computes a Steiner tree in $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ rounds and
$\tilde{O}(n^{7/3})$ messages for a given connected undirected weighted graph
of $n$ nodes. Note here that $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ notation hides polylogarithmic

rounds and $O(S (n - t)^2 + n^2)$ messages, where $S$ and $t$ are the
\emph{shortest path diameter} and the number of \emph{terminal} nodes

407% higher than those of DRAM, respectively. The read/write bandwidths were

emerging hybrid memory architecture. In this paper, we present RAMinate, a
hypervisor-based virtualization mechanism for hybrid memory systems, and a key
technology to address the performance gap in main memory systems. It provides
great flexibility in memory management and maximizes the performance of virtual

optimization. The elapsed time to finish the build of Linux Kernel in the VM

computer vision, and critical for large-scale video surveillance scenarios
where an individual could appear in different camera views at different times.
There has been recent interest in tackling this challenge using cross-domain
approaches, which leverages data from source domains that are different than
the target domain. Such approaches are more practical for real-world widespread
deployment given that they don't require on-site training (as with unsupervised
or domain transfer approaches) or on-site manual annotation and training (as
with supervised approaches). In this study, we take a systematic approach to
establishing a large baseline source domain and target domain for cross-domain
person ReID. We accomplish this by conducting a comprehensive analysis to study
the similarities between source domains proposed in literature, and studying
the effects of incrementally increasing the size of the source domain. This
allows us to establish a balanced source domain and target domain split that
promotes variety in both source and target domains. Furthermore, using lessons
learned from the state-of-the-art supervised person re-identification methods,
we establish a strong baseline method for cross-domain person ReID. Experiments
show that a source domain composed of two of the largest person ReID domains
(SYSU and MSMT) performs well across six commonly-used target domains.
Furthermore, we show that, surprisingly, two of the recent commonly-used
domains (PRID and GRID) have too few query images to provide meaningful
insights. As such, based on our findings, we propose the following balanced
baseline for cross-domain person ReID consisting of: i) a fixed multi-source
domain consisting of SYSU, MSMT, Airport and 3DPeS, and ii) a multi-target

superconducting dome. One perspective sees $T^*(p)$ cutting the dome and
continuing to descend monotonically to zero at $p_{crit} \approx 0.19$ holes/Cu
$-$ referred to here as `entrant behavior'. Another perspective derived from
photoemission studies is that $T^*(p)$ intersects the dome near $p_{crit}

Rather, $p_{crit} \approx 0.19$ sharply delimits the pseudogap regime and for

Previous work uses a traditional method, comprised of feature extraction and

fusion layer is tailored to the need of fusing information from the fundus and

Loose Pair training, where a fundus image and an OCT image are paired based on

software defect prediction. It is an approach that may be valuable for software
practitioners because it reduces the need for labeled training data. Objective:
Investigate the use and performance of unsupervised learning techniques in
software defect prediction. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review
that identified 49 studies containing 2456 individual experimental results,
which satisfied our inclusion criteria published between January 2000 and March
2018. In order to compare prediction performance across these studies in a
consistent way, we (re-)computed the confusion matrices and employed the
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as our main performance measure.
Results: Our meta-analysis shows that unsupervised models are comparable with
supervised models for both within-project and cross-project prediction. Among
the 14 families of unsupervised model, Fuzzy CMeans (FCM) and Fuzzy SOMs
(FSOMs) perform best. In addition, where we were able to check, we found that
almost 11% (262/2456) of published results (contained in 16 papers) were
internally inconsistent and a further 33% (823/2456) provided insufficient
details for us to check. Conclusion: Although many factors impact the
performance of a classifier, e.g., dataset characteristics, broadly speaking,
unsupervised classifiers do not seem to perform worse than the supervised
classifiers in our review. However, we note a worrying prevalence of (i)
demonstrably erroneous experimental results, (ii) undemanding benchmarks and
(iii) incomplete reporting. We therefore encourage researchers to be
comprehensive in their reporting.

with each other via virtual overlay links built upon an underlying network
(usually, the Internet). P2P networks are highly dynamic and can experience
very heavy churn, i.e., a large number of nodes join/leave the network
continuously. Thus, building and maintaining a stable overlay network is an
important problem that has been studied extensively for two decades.
  In this paper, we present our \Pe overlay network called Sparse Robust
Addressable Network (Spartan). Spartan can be quickly and efficiently built in
a fully distributed fashion within $O(\log n)$ rounds. Furthermore, the Spartan
overlay structure can be maintained, again, in a fully distributed manner
despite adversarially controlled churn (i.e., nodes joining and leaving) and
significant variation in the number of nodes. Moreover, new nodes can join a
committee within $O(1)$ rounds and leaving nodes can leave without any notice.
  The number of nodes in the network lies in $[n, fn]$ for any fixed $f\ge 1$.
Up to $\epsilon n$ nodes (for some small but fixed $\epsilon > 0$) can be
adversarially added/deleted within {\em any} period of $P$ rounds for some $P
\in O(\log \log n)$. Despite such uncertainty in the network, Spartan maintains
$\Theta(n/\log n)$ committees that are stable and addressable collections of
$\Theta(\log n)$ nodes each for $O(polylog(n))$ rounds with high probability.
  Spartan's committees are also capable of performing sustained computation and
passing messages between each other. Thus, any protocol designed for static
networks can be simulated on Spartan with minimal overhead. This makes Spartan
an ideal platform for developing applications. We experimentally show that
Spartan will remain robust as long as each committee, on average, contains 24
nodes for networks of size up to $10240$.

Urbana-type three-body force. We have adopted the MIT bag model as well as

combining two EOS of the hadronic sector and quark sector of a star, which are
derived from independent models or theories. The hadron-quark transition is
constructed by considering a sharp phase transition, i.e., Maxwell
construction. The structure of the HS is calculated and reported by solving
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. Finally the radii and tidal deformability
of purely NS and HS for the mass of $ 1.4M_{\odot} $ is computed and new
constraints on these quantities are checked. The maximum mass of HS is found
more than $ 2 M_{\odot} $ for both the NJL and MIT bag models. However, the
maximum mass of $ 1.796 M_{\odot} $ ($ 1.896 M_{\odot} $) was the best result
that would be calculated for a stable HS with the pure quark core within the

analysis on the structure of purely NS and HS and also compactness, tidal Love

regulate mutually to adapt the cell state to environmental conditions. In
addition to function, the GRNs possess several kinds of robustness. This
robustness means that systems do not lose their functionality when exposed to
disturbances such as mutations or noise, and is widely observed at many levels
in living systems. Both function and robustness have been acquired through
evolution. In this respect, GRNs utilized in living systems are rare among all
possible GRNs. In this study, we explored the fitness landscape of GRNs and
investigated how robustness emerged in highly-fit GRNs. We considered a toy
model of GRNs with one input gene and one output gene. The difference in the
expression level of the output gene between two input states, ""on"" and ""off"",
was considered as fitness. Thus, the determination of the fitness of a GRN was
based on how sensitively it responded to the input.We employed the
multicanonical Monte Carlo method, which can sample GRNs randomly in a wide
range of fitness levels, and classified the GRNs according to their fitness.
The following properties were found: (1) Highly-fit GRNs exhibited bistability
for intermediate input between ""on"" and ""off"". This means that such GRNs
responded to two input states by using different fixed points of dynamics. This
bistability emerges necessarily as fitness increases. (2) These highly-fit GRNs
were robust against noise because of their bistability. In other words, noise
robustness is a byproduct of high fitness. (3) GRNs that were robust against
mutations were not extremely rare among the highly-fit GRNs. This implies that
mutational robustness is readily acquired through the evolutionary process.
These properties are universal irrespective of the evolutionary pathway,
because the results do not rely on evolutionary simulation.

shape functions from sets of scattered data. We present an asymptotically
compatible (AC) RK collocation method for nonlocal diffusion models with
Dirichlet boundary condition. The scheme is shown to be convergent to both
nonlocal diffusion and its corresponding local limit as nonlocal interaction
vanishes. The analysis is carried out on a special family of rectilinear
Cartesian grids for linear RK method with designed kernel support. The key idea
for the stability of the RK collocation scheme is to compare the collocation
scheme with the standard Galerkin scheme which is stable. In addition, there is
a large computational cost for assembling the stiffness matrix of the nonlocal
problem because high order Gaussian quadrature is usually needed to evaluate
the integral. We thus provide a remedy to the problem by introducing a
quasi-discrete nonlocal diffusion operator for which no numerical quadrature is
further needed after applying the RK collocation scheme. The quasi-discrete
nonlocal diffusion operator combined with RK collocation is shown to be
convergent to the correct local diffusion problem by taking the limits of
nonlocal interaction and spatial resolution simultaneously. The theoretical
results are then validated with numerical experiments. We additionally
illustrate a connection between the proposed technique and an existing
optimization based approach based on generalized moving least squares (GMLS).

carrier mobility of MoSe2 is estimated as 690 cm^2/Vs at room temperature, far
more high than that of other two MoX2. For the reason, the combination of the
modest carrier effective mass and weak electron-phonon coupling lead to the
outstanding transport performance of MoSe2. The Seebeck coefficient of MoSe2 is
also evaluated as high as 300 10^-6 V/K at room temperature. Due to the
temperature dependent mobility of T^-1.9 and higher Seebeck coefficient at low

in a strong radio-frequency (RF) field, taking into account magnetic and
nonmagnetic impurities, finite quasiparticle lifetimes, and a thin
proximity-coupled normal layer characteristic of the oxide surface of many
materials. The Usadel equations were solved to obtain the quasiparticle density
of states (DOS) and the low-frequency surface resistance $R_s$ as functions of
the RF field amplitude $H_0$. It is shown that the interplay of the broadening
of the DOS peaks and a decrease of a quasiparticle gap caused by the RF
currents produces a minimum in $R_s(H_0)$ and an extended rise of the quality
factor $Q(H_0)$ with the RF field. Paramagnetic impurities shift the minimum in
$R_s(H_0)$ to lower fields and can reduce $R_s(H_0)$ in a wide range of $H_0$.
Subgap states in the DOS can give rise to a residual surface resistance while
reducing $R_s$ at higher temperatures. A proximity-coupled normal layer at the
surface can shift the minimum in $R_s(H_0)$ to either low and high fields and
can reduce $R_s$ below that of an ideal surface. The theory shows that the
behavior of $R_s(H_0)$ changes as the temperature and the RF frequency are
increased, and the field dependence of $Q(H_0)$ can be very sensitive to the
materials processing. Our results suggest that the nonlinear RF losses can be
minimized by tuning pairbreaking effects at the surface using impurity
management or surface nanostructuring.

However, by learning to infer and deduct additional information and structure,
we can massively increase the usefulness of the underlying data. One common
form of inferential reasoning in knowledge bases is implication discovery.
Here, by learning when one relation implies another, we can extend our
knowledge representation. There are several existing models for relational
implication, however we argue they are motivated but not principled. To this
end, we define a formal probabilistic model of relational implication. By using
estimators based on the empirical distribution of our dataset, we demonstrate
that our model outperforms existing approaches. While previous work achieves a
best score of 0.7812 AUC on an evaluatory dataset, our ProbE model improves
this to 0.7915. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be improved
substantially through the use of link prediction models and dense latent
representations of the underlying argument and relations. This variant, denoted
ProbL, improves the state of the art on our evaluation dataset to 0.8143. In
addition to developing a new framework and providing novel scores of relational
implication, we provide two pragmatic resources to assist future research.
First, we motivate and develop an improved crowd framework for constructing
labelled datasets of relational implication. Using this, we reannotate and make
public a dataset comprised of 17,848 instances of labelled relational
implication. We demonstrate that precision (as evaluated by expert consensus
with the crowd labels) on the resulting dataset improves from 53% to 95%.

effect of the non-minimal derivative coupling on thick brane. First, the
equations of motion are presented and a set of analytic background solutions
are obtained. Then, to investigate the stability of the background scalar
profile, we present a novel canonically normalized method, and show that
although the original background scalar field is unstable, the canonical one is
stable. The stability of the thick brane under tensor perturbation is also
considered. It is shown that the tachyon is absent and the graviton zero mode
can be localized on the brane. The localized graviton zero mode recovers the
four-dimensional Newtonian potential and the presence of the non-minimal
derivative coupling results in a splitting of its wave function. The correction
of the massive graviton KK modes to the Newtonian potential is also analyzed
briefly.

the problem of the probability of decoding a fraction of source messages, i.e.,

Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion to derive expressions of partial decoding
probability. The presented model predicts the probability of partial decoding
with an average deviation of 6%. Our results show that SNC has a great
potential for recovering a fraction of the source message, especially in higher
sparsity and lower Galois Field size. Moreover, to achieve a better probability

at hightemperatures, the soft mode is found at (0,0,0.5) at the Brillouin zone
boundary and is measured by inelastic X-ray scattering and thermal diffuse
scattering. In the low-symmetry phase, this softmode is folded back onto the
center of the Brillouin zone as a result of the doubling of the unit cell, and
appears as a fully symmetric mode that can be tracked by Raman spectroscopy. On
both sides of the transition, the mode energy squared follows a linear
behaviour over a large temperature range. First-principles calculations reveal
that, surprisingly, the flat phonon band calculated for the high-symmetry phase
seems incompatible with the displacive character found experimentally. We
discuss this unusual behavior in the context of an ideal Kittel model of an

(OC), where OC means that AN and CM are projected onto the null-spaces of the

the proposed Min-TP and Min-RTP methods perform much better than existing equal

(SR) at medium and high signal-to-noise ratio regions. The SR performance
difference between the proposed two methods becomes trivial as the number of
transmit antennas approaches large-scale. More importantly, we also find the
fact that all three schemes including EA, Min-TP, and Min-RTP can form two main
peaks of AN and CM around Eve and Bob, respectively. This achieves both PJ and
secure precise wireless transmission (SPWT), called SPJC.

correlation between different steps in QW and leads to a ballistic position

from the ensemble interpretation, named quantum random walk (QRW), where the
walker has many unrelated coins, modeled as two-level systems, initially
prepared in the same state. We calculate the walker's position distribution in
QRW for different initial coin states with the coin operator chosen as Hadamard
matrix. In one-dimensional case, the walker's position is the asymmetric
binomial distribution. We further demonstrate that in QRW, coherence leads the
walker to perform directional movement. For an initially decoherenced coin
state, the walker's position distribution is exactly the same as that of CRW.
Moreover, we study QRW in 2D lattice, where the coherence plays a more
diversified role in the walker's position distribution.

consider three generalizations of the concept of simplicial vertices: avoidable

common generalization avoidable paths, introduced here. We present a general
conjecture on the existence of avoidable paths. If true, the conjecture would
imply a result due to Ohtsuki, Cheung, and Fujisawa from 1976 on the existence

the first open case of the conjecture. We point out a close relationship
between avoidable vertices in a graph and its minimal triangulations, and
identify new algorithmic uses of avoidable vertices, leading to new

graphs simultaneously generalizing chordal graphs and circular-arc graphs.
Finally, we observe that the proved cases of the conjecture have interesting

mechanism that contributes to prevention of the genomic decay: the competition
and selection between the recently diverged species/populations. We demonstrate
that the large resource influx and fast speciation are favorable conditions
against the genomic decay. The model predicts that in the case of several

the polymer paradigm simultaneously to the isotropic one (linked to the
Universe volume) and to the two anisotropy ones (characterizing the physical
gravitational degrees of freedom). Setting two different cut-off scales for the
two different variable sets, i.e. the geometrical volume and the gravity tensor
modes, we demonstrate how the semiclassical properties of the Bianchi IX
dynamics are sensitive to the ratio of the cut-off parameters. In particular,
the semiclassical evolution turns out to be chaotic only if the parameter
associated to the volume discretization is greater or equal to that one of the
anisotropies. Concerning the chaotic case we perform a purely quantum polymer
analysis, demonstrating that the original Misner result about the existence of
quasi-classical states near the singularity (in the sense of high occupation
numbers) is still valid in the revised approach and able to account for cut-off
physics effects. The possibility for a comparison with the original study by
Misner is possible because the singularity is still present in the
semiclassical evolution of the cosmological model for all the parameter space.
We interpret this surprising feature as the consequence of a geometrical volume
discretization which does not prevent the volume from vanishing, i.e. restoring
in the Minisuperspace analysis its zero value.

increase in the Raman frequency of the hydrogen molecule vibron is due to the
number of H$_2$ molecules participating in the mode. There is no chemical
bonding between He and H$_2$, helium acts only to separate the molecules. The
variety of possible environments for H$_2$ gives rise to many Raman active

to be the lower frequency vibrons, these effects work together to produce the
majority of the shift seen in experiment. We used Density Functional Theory

pseudo-scalar particles (axions), motivated by the strong CP problem and
axiverse scenario in string theory. Depending on their mass and type of
self-interaction, these particles can build self-gravitating configurations
such as compact objects, DM clumps or even galactic DM halos. On the other
hand, superradiant instabilities can produce long-living extended
configurations (scalar clouds) gravitating around Black Holes (BHs). As these
scalars are real and harmonic, their interaction with the other matter
components can induce a parametric resonance that might lead to their
observable signatures. First, we consider the orbital dynamics of test
particles in these axion configurations, show when resonances can occur and
discuss the secular evolution of the orbital elements. This scenario can lead
to observable consequences for binary pulsars or S stars around the
supermassive BH in our Galaxy. Secondly, we discuss electromagnetic (EM) field
instabilities in homogeneous axion configurations as well as scalar clouds
around Kerr BHs. These axion-photon resonances can quench superradiant
instabilities, while producing an observable signature in the EM sector. We

large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems due to their critical roles to
support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogenous devices,
machines and industry processes. Conventional authentication and authorization
schemes are insufficient in dealing the emerging IoT security challenges due to
their reliance on both static digital mechanisms and computational complexity
for improving security level. Furthermore, the isolated security designs for
different layers and link segments while ignoring the overall protection lead
to cascaded security risks as well as growing communication latency and
overhead. In this article, we envision new artificial intelligence (AI) enabled
security provisioning approaches to overcome these issues while achieving fast
authentication and progressive authorization. To be more specific, a
lightweight intelligent authentication approach is developed by exploring
machine learning at the gateway to identify the access time slots or
frequencies of resource-constraint devices. Then we propose a holistic
authentication and authorization approach, where online machine learning and
trust management are adopted for analyzing the complex dynamic environment and
achieving adaptive access control. These new AI enabled approaches establish
the connections between transceivers quickly and enhance security
progressively, so that communication latency can be reduced and security risks
are well-controlled in large-scale IoT. Finally, we outline several areas for
AI-enabled security provisioning for future researches.

inspiration from social computing. This survey aims to investigate the research
done on SIoT from two perspectives including application domain and the
integration to the new computing models. For this, a two-dimensional framework
is proposed and the projects are investigated, accordingly. The first dimension
considers and classifies available research from the application domain
perspective and the second dimension performs the same from the integration to
new computing models standpoint. The aim is to technically describe SIoT, to
classify related research, to foster the dissemination of state-of-the-art, and
to discuss open research directions in this field.

gravity and also the geometry of the thermodynamic phase space. Under the
influence of the latter, the energy-temperature relation of ideal gas may
change. Moreover, it seems that the Newtonian gravity is modified in the
framework of the R\'{e}nyi entropy formalism motivated by both the long-range
nature of gravity, and the extended uncertainty principle. Here, the
consequences of employing the generalized and extended uncertainty principles,
instead of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, on the Jeans mass are studied.
The results of working in the R\'{e}nyi entropy formalism are also addressed.
It is shown that unlike the extended uncertainty principle and the R\'{e}nyi
entropy formalism which lead to the same increase in the Jeans mass, the
generalized uncertainty principle can decrease it. The latter means that a
cloud with mass smaller than the standard Jeans mass, obtained in the framework
of the Newtonian gravity, may also undergo the gravitational collapse process.

propagating along magnetic field with a ring-shape perpendicular momentum
distribution in neutral and current-free solar coronal plasmas. These plasmas
are subject to both the beam and the electron cyclotron maser (ECM)
instabilities driven by the positive momentum gradient of the ring-beam
electron distribution in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the
ambient magnetic field, respectively. To explore the related kinetic processes
self-consistently, 2.5-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations were carried out. To quantify excited wave properties in different
coronal conditions, we investigated the dependence of their energy and
polarization on the ring-beam electron density and magnetic field. In general,
electrostatic waves dominate the energetics of waves and nonlinear waves are
ubiquitous. In weakly magnetized plasmas, where the electron cyclotron
frequency $\omega_{ce}$ is lower than the electron plasma frequency
$\omega_{pe}$, it is difficult to produce escaping electromagnetic waves with
frequency $\omega > \omega_{pe}$ and small refractive index $|c k / \omega| <
1$ ($k$ and $c$ are the wavenumber and the light speed, respectively). Highly
polarized and anisotropic escaping electromagnetic waves can, however, be
effectively excited in strongly magnetized plasmas with
$\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe} \geq 1$. The anisotropy of the energy, circular
polarization degree (CPD), and spectrogram of these escaping electromagnetic
waves strongly depend on the number density ratio of the ring-beam electrons to
the background electrons. In particular, their CPDs can vary from left-handed
to right-handed with the decrease of the ring-beam density, which may explain
some observed properties of solar radio bursts (e.g., radio spikes) from the
solar corona.

learning control policies for high-dimensional inputs, these algorithms are
generally intractable to deploy on real robots due to sample complexity. In
this work, we use self-supervision to learn a compact and multimodal
representation of our sensory inputs, which can then be used to improve the
sample efficiency of our policy learning. Evaluating our method on a peg
insertion task, we show that it generalizes over varying geometries,
configurations, and clearances, while being robust to external perturbations.
We also systematically study different self-supervised learning objectives and
representation learning architectures. Results are presented in simulation and
on a physical robot.

  arXiv:1711.00956",,,,"cs.NE cs.CC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a sort of nature-inspired metaheuristics,
which have wide applications in various practical optimization problems. In
these problems, objective evaluations are usually inaccurate, because noise is
almost inevitable in real world, and it is a crucial issue to weaken the
negative effect caused by noise. Sampling is a popular strategy, which
evaluates the objective a couple of times, and employs the mean of these
evaluation results as an estimate of the objective value. In this work, we
introduce a novel sampling method, median sampling, into EAs, and illustrate
its properties and usefulness theoretically by solving OneMax, the problem of
maximizing the number of 1s in a bit string. Instead of the mean, median
sampling employs the median of the evaluation results as an estimate. Through
rigorous theoretical analysis on OneMax under the commonly used onebit noise,
we show that median sampling reduces the expected runtime exponentially. Next,
through two special noise models, we show that when the 2-quantile of the noisy
fitness increases with the true fitness, median sampling can be better than
mean sampling; otherwise, it may fail and mean sampling can be better. The
results may guide us to employ median sampling properly in practical
applications.

The run vehicle has an inertial profiler with laser line sensors to record road
roughness according to the IRI. The RMS and Machine Learning (ML) methods are
used in this study. There is different ability of each smartphone to detect the

algorithm, can be obtained via the natural explicit discretization from our
dynamical system. Our dynamical system can be viewed as a perturbed version of
the heavy ball method with vanishing damping, however the perturbation is made
in the argument of the gradient of the objective function. This perturbation
seems to have a smoothing effect for the energy error and eliminates the
oscillations obtained for this error in the case of the heavy ball method with
vanishing damping, as some numerical experiments show. We prove that the value
of the objective function in a generated trajectory converges in order O(1/t^2)
to the global minimum of the objective function. Moreover, we obtain that a
trajectory generated by the dynamical system converges to a minimum point of
the objective function.
