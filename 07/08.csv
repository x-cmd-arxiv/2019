We consider the universe to be filled with two types of fluids barotropic and
dark energy which have variable equations of state. The evolution of dark
energy, Hubble, and deceleration parameters etc., have been described in the

scattering processes in galactic stellar nuclei, assuming all stars have the

gravitational wave emission modifies the slope of the inner stellar cusp within
the SMBH sphere of influence, and calculated the rates of tidal disruption

of the TDE and MS-EMRI rates is the square of the ratio of the tidal and

just about a percent of the TDE rate. We then consider the role of stars

from XMM Newton and Chandra observations of 16 FU Ori stars, including a new
XMM Newton observation of Gaia 17bpi during its optical rise phase. Of these
stars, six were detected at least once, while 10 were non-detections, for which
we calculate upper limits on intrinsic X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) as a function
of plasma temperature ($kT$) and column density ($N_H$). The detected FU Ori
stars tend to be more X-ray luminous than typical for non-outbursting YSOs,
based on comparison to a sample of low-mass stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster.
FU Ori stars with high $L_X$ have been observed both at the onset of their
outbursts and decades later. We use the Kaplan-Meier estimator to investigate
whether the higher X-ray luminosities for FU Ori stars is characteristic or a
result of selection effects, and we find the difference to be statistically
significant ($p<0.01$) even when non-detections are taken into account. The
additional X-ray luminosity of FU Ori stars relative to non-outbursting YSOs
cannot be explained by accretion shocks, given the high observed plasma
temperatures. This suggests that, for many FU Ori stars, either 1) the outburst
leads to a restructuring of the magnetosphere in a way that enhances X-ray
emission, or 2) FU Ori outbursts are more likely to occur among YSOs with the
highest quiescent X-ray luminosity.

are not). By contrast, all previously proposed measures of contextuality are
confined to consistently connected systems, and most of them cannot be extended
to measures of noncontextuality. Our measures of (non)contextuality are defined
by the L_{1}-distance between a point representing a cyclic system and the
surface of the polytope representing all possible noncontextual cyclic systems
with the same single-variable marginals. We completely characterize this
polytope, as well as the polytope of all possible probabilistic couplings for
cyclic systems with given single-variable marginals.[...]

a single shard, thus delaying processing in the entire system. Moreover, we
show that in common scenarios, these protocols require most node operators to
process almost all blockchain transactions. We present Ostraka, a blockchain
node architecture that shards (parallelizes) the nodes themselves. We prove
that replacing a unified node with an Ostraka node does not affect the security

allows nodes in the network to scale, without costly coordination. In our

evaluating common voxel-wise uncertainty measures with respect to their
reliability, and limitations on two medical image segmentation datasets.
Results show that current uncertainty methods perform similarly and although
they are well-calibrated at the dataset level, they tend to be miscalibrated at
subject-level. Therefore, the reliability of uncertainty estimates is
compromised, highlighting the importance of developing subject-wise uncertainty
estimations. Additionally, among the benchmarked methods, we found auxiliary

be applied to any previously trained segmentation model.

studied two-dimensional, time-homogeneous, spatially-correlated diffusion with

acid, some of its synonymous codons are used much more rarely than others.
Analyses of positions of such rare codons in protein sequences revealed that
rare codons can impact co-translational protein folding and that positions of
some rare codons are evolutionary conserved. Analyses of positions of rare
codons in proteins' 3-dimensional structures, which are richer in biochemical
information than sequences alone, might further explain the role of rare codons
in protein folding. We analyze a protein set recently annotated with codon
usage information, considering non-redundant proteins with sufficient
structural information. We model the proteins' structures as networks and study
potential differences between network positions of amino acids encoded by
evolutionary conserved rare, evolutionary non-conserved rare, and commonly used
codons. In 84% of the proteins, at least one of the three codon categories
occupies significantly more or less network-central positions than the other
codon categories. Different protein groups showing different codon centrality
trends (i.e., different types of relationships between network positions of the
three codon categories) are enriched in different biological functions,
implying the existence of a link between codon usage, protein folding, and
protein function.

gravity field of the set of cylinders has been calculated. The optimal values
of the initial positions and velocities of atomic clouds were obtained. It is
shown that at equal sizes of the atomic cloud in the vertical and transverse
directions, as well as at equal atomic vertical and transverse temperatures,
systematic errors due to the finite size and temperature of the cloud
disappear. To overcome the influence of the Earth gravitational field on the
accuracy of the phase double difference measurement, it is proposed to use the
technique of eliminating gravity-gradient terms. After eliminating, one can use
extreme values of the atomic positions and velocities. Nonlinear dependences of
the phase on the uncertainties of atomic positions and velocities near those
extreme values required us to modify the expression for the standard phase
deviation. Moreover, such dependences lead to a phase shift, which was also
calculated. The relative accuracy of measurements of Newtonian gravitational
constant 10^-4 and 2*10^-5 is predicted for sets of 24 and 630 cylinders,

is affected by inherent biases in our empirical methods -- both those that rely
on direct dust emission and those that rely on the inferred dust attenuation of
starlight. We use a library of hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer
to explore these biases. We find that for IR luminous galaxies that are in
rapidly quenching systems (e.g. post-coalescence) standard luminosity-to-SFR
relations can strongly overestimate the true SFRs. We propose using the
$L_{IR}/L_{1.6}$ color to both help identify such systems and provide more
accurate SFRs. Conversely, we find that the diagnostic UVJ plot misidentifies a
subset of dusty star-forming galaxies. This is due to variability in the
effective attenuation curves including being much grayer in the
optical-to-near-IR regime than the Calzetti starburst law. This is in agreement
with recent observations of IR-selected galaxies at cosmic noon. Our results
support the view that we need a panchromatic approach from the rest-frame UV
through the IR and SED modeling that includes realistic SFHs and allows for
variable attenuation curves if we want to fully account for dust obscured
star-formation across the epochs of greatest galaxy build-up.

Eigensolver (VQE) technique involves measurement of the Hamiltonian expectation
value. Current hardware can perform only projective single-qubit measurements,
and thus, the Hamiltonian expectation value is obtained by measuring parts of
the Hamiltonian rather than the full Hamiltonian. This restriction makes the
measurement process inefficient because the number of terms in the Hamiltonian
grows as $O(N^4)$ with the size of the system, $N$. To optimize VQE measurement
one can try to group as many Hamiltonian terms as possible for their
simultaneous measurement. Single-qubit measurements allow one to group only the
terms that commute within corresponding single-qubit subspaces or qubit-wise
commuting. We found that qubit-wise commutativity between the Hamiltonian terms
can be expressed as a graph and the problem of the optimal grouping is
equivalent of finding a minimum clique cover (MCC) for the Hamiltonian graph.
The MCC problem is NP-hard but there exist several polynomial heuristic
algorithms to solve it approximately. Several of these heuristics were tested
in this work for a set of molecular electronic Hamiltonians. On average,
grouping qubit-wise commuting terms reduced the number of operators to measure
three times compared to the total number of terms in the considered
Hamiltonians.

many contexts. An example is the extraction of the strong coupling, $\alpha_s$,
from hadronic $\tau$-decay data, using a variety of analysis methods based on
finite-energy sum rules. Here, we reconsider a long-used method, which
parametrizes non-perturbative contributions to the $I=1$ vector and axial
vacuum polarizations with the OPE, setting several higher-dimension
coefficients to zero in order to implement the method in practice. The
assumption that doing this has a negligible effect on the value of $\alpha_s$
is tantamount to the assumption that the low-dimension part of the OPE
converges rapidly with increasing dimension near the $\tau$ mass. Were this
assumption valid, it would certainly have to be valid at energies above the
$\tau$ mass as well. It follows that the method can be tested using data
obtained from $e^+e^-\to\mbox{hadrons}$, as they are not limited by the
kinematic constraints of $\tau$ decays. We carry out such an investigation
using a recent high-precision compilation for the $R$-ratio, arguing that it
provides insights into the validity of the strategy, even if it probes a
different, though related channel. We find that $e^+e^-$-based tests call into
question the implied assumption of rapid convergence of the low-dimension part
of the OPE around the $\tau$ mass, and thus underscore the need to restrict
finite-energy sum-rule analyses to observables which receive only contributions
from lower-order terms in the OPE.

such a case, the partition function of JT gravity is still related to the
volume of the moduli space of conformal structures, but this volume has a
quantum correction and has to be computed using Reidemeister-Ray-Singer

of ordinary Riemann surfaces. In all cases we match JT gravity or supergravity
with an appropriate random matrix ensemble. All ten standard random matrix
ensembles make an appearance -- the three Dyson ensembles and the seven
Altland-Zirnbauer ensembles. To facilitate the analysis, we extend to the other

However, the intricate mechanisms and the large degrees of freedom of the

the smaller design tasks of the meta-atoms through deep learning and
evolutionary algorithms. We leverage the proposed framework to design metallic
meta-molecules for arbitrary manipulation of the polarization and wavefront of

confirmed through experimental validations. This framework reveals a promising

the server that trains the model is assumed to be untrusted and potentially

algorithm for training linear support vector machines (SVM) in a setting in
which data-holding clients communicate with an untrusted server by exchanging

evaluate our model in two ways. First, in an offline evaluation, we train SecVM

a result of the gravitational influence from companions which can cause the

transit time variations (TTV) are characteristic of the perturbing planet's
mass and orbit. The objects of interest (TOI) from the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) are analyzed in a uniform way to search for TTVs with
sectors 1-3 of data. Due to the volume of targets in the TESS candidate list,
artificial intelligence is used to expedite the search for planets by vetting
non-transit signals prior to characterizing the light curve time series. The
residuals of fitting a linear orbit ephemeris are used to search for transit
timing variations. The significance of a perturbing planet is assessed by
comparing the Bayesian evidence between a linear and non-linear ephemeris,
which is based on an N-body simulation. Nested sampling is used to derive
posterior distributions for the N-body ephemeris and in order to expedite
convergence custom priors are designed using machine learning. A dual input,

of the world due to their higher operational reliability, reduced construction
space and effective protection for wildlife animals. In spite of these
advantages, a major challenge of using CC is that the ordinary upstream
protection devices are not able to detect the phase-to-ground faults and the
frequent tree/tree branch hitting conductor events on such conductors. This is
because these events only lead to partial discharge (PD) activities rather than
overcurrent signatures typically seen on bare conductors. To solve this
problem, in recent years, ENET Center in Czech Republic (ENET) devised a simple
meter to measure the voltage signal of the electric stray field along CC,
aiming to detect the above hazardous PD activities. In 2018, ENET shared a
large amount of waveform data recorded by their meter on Kaggle, the world's
largest data science collaboration platform, encouraging worldwide experts to
develop an effective pattern recognition method for the acquired signals. In
response, we developed a unique method based on time-series decomposition and
Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) in addition to unique feature engineering
process to recognize PD activities on CC. The proposed method is tested on the
ENET public dataset and compared to various traditional classification methods.
It demonstrated superior performance and great practicality.

turbulence. The effects of turbulence are taken into account by enhancing the
effective pressure of a low density gas. We derive the effective pressure as a
function of the density from the condition of the hydrostatic balance. It is
shown that the model cloud is more unstable against radial collapse, when the
radial density slope is shallower. When the magnetic field is mildly strong,
the radial collapse is suppressed. If the displacement vanishes in the region
very far from the cloud axis, the model cloud is stabilized completely by a
mildly strong magnetic field. If rearrangement of the magnetic flux tubes is
permitted, the model cloud is unstable even when the magnetic field is
extremely strong. The stability depends on the outer boundary condition as in
case of the isothermal cloud. The growth rate of the rearrangement mode is
smaller when the radial density slope is shallower.

when solely provided with source labeled and target unlabeled examples for
training. Learning domain-invariant features helps to achieve this goal,
whereas it underpins unlabeled samples drawn from a single or multiple explicit
target domains (Multi-target DA). In this paper, we consider a more realistic
transfer scenario: our target domain is comprised of multiple sub-targets
implicitly blended with each other, so that learners could not identify which
sub-target each unlabeled sample belongs to. This Blending-target Domain
Adaptation (BTDA) scenario commonly appears in practice and threatens the
validities of most existing DA algorithms, due to the presence of domain gaps
and categorical misalignments among these hidden sub-targets.
  To reap the transfer performance gains in this new scenario, we propose
Adversarial Meta-Adaptation Network (AMEAN). AMEAN entails two adversarial
transfer learning processes. The first is a conventional adversarial transfer
to bridge our source and mixed target domains. To circumvent the intra-target
category misalignment, the second process presents as ``learning to adapt'': It
deploys an unsupervised meta-learner receiving target data and their ongoing
feature-learning feedbacks, to discover target clusters as our
``meta-sub-target'' domains. These meta-sub-targets auto-design our
meta-sub-target DA loss, which empirically eliminates the implicit category
mismatching in our mixed target. We evaluate AMEAN and a variety of DA
algorithms in three benchmarks under the BTDA setup. Empirical results show
that BTDA is a quite challenging transfer setup for most existing DA
algorithms, yet AMEAN significantly outperforms these state-of-the-art
baselines and effectively restrains the negative transfer effects in BTDA.

susceptible to these effects than giant systems. Combined luminosity functions
(LFs) in the r- and u-band of 15 galaxy clusters were constructed using
archival data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. LFs were measured as a
function of cluster-centric radius from stacked cluster data. Marginal evidence
was found for an increase in the faint-end slope of the u-band LF relative to
the r-band with increasing cluster-centric radius. The dwarf-to-giant ratio
(DGR) was found to increase toward the cluster outskirts, with the u-band DGR
increasing faster with cluster-centric radius compared to the r-band. The dG
blue fraction was found to be ~2 times larger than the giant galaxy blue
fraction over all cluster-centric distance (~5sigma level). The central
concentration (C) was used as a proxy to distinguish nucleated versus
non-nucleated dGs. The ratio of high-C to low-C dGs was found to be ~2 times
greater in the inner cluster region compared to the outskirts (2.8sigma level).
The faint-end slope of the r-band LF for the cluster outskirts (0.6 < r/r_200 <
1.0) is steeper than the SDSS field LF, while the u-band LF is marginally
steeper at the 2.5sigma level. Decrease in the faint-end slope of the r- and

star formation via ram pressure stripping and galaxy-galaxy interactions.

generalization for the training and test data from different domains.
Experiments show that the proposed multi-task system performs each task better

The microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) is one of cutting-edge
superconducting detector. It is based on the principle of a superconducting
resonator circuit. A radiation entering the MKID breaks the Cooper pairs in the
superconducting resonator, and the intensity of the radiation is detected as a
variation of the resonant condition. Therefore, calibration of the detector
responsivity, i.e., the variation of the resonant phase with respect to the
number of Cooper-pair breaks (quasiparticles), is important. We propose a
method for responsivity calibration. Microwaves used for the detector readout
locally raise the temperature in each resonator, which increases the number of
quasiparticles. Since the magnitude of the temperature rise depends on the
power of readout microwaves, the number of quasiparticles also depends on the
power of microwaves. By changing the power of the readout microwaves, we
simultaneously measure the phase difference and lifetime of quasiparticles. We
calculate the number of quasiparticles from the measured lifetime and by using
a theoretical formula. This measurement yields a relation between the phase
response as a function of the number of quasiparticles. We demonstrate this
responsivity calibration using the MKID maintained at 285mK. We also confirm
consistency between the results obtained using this method and conventional
calibration methods in terms of the accuracy.

methods (such as Conjugate Gradient, GMRES, or MINRES) are often the only
practical choice. To converge in a small number of iterations, however, they
have to be coupled with an efficient preconditioner. The efficiency of the
preconditioner depends largely on its accuracy on the eigenvectors
corresponding to small eigenvalues, and unfortunately, black-box methods
typically cannot guarantee sufficient accuracy on these eigenvectors. Thus,
constructing the preconditioner becomes a problem-dependent task. However, for
a large class of problems, including many elliptic equations, the eigenvectors
corresponding to small eigenvalues are smooth functions of the PDE grid. In
this paper, we describe a hierarchical approximate factorization approach which
focuses on improving accuracy on the smooth eigenvectors. The improved accuracy
is achieved by preserving the action of the factorized matrix on piecewise
polynomial functions of the grid. Based on the factorization, we propose a
family of sparse preconditioners with $O(n)$ or $O(n \log{n})$ construction
complexities. Our methods exhibit the optimal $O(n)$ solution times in
benchmarks run on large elliptic problems of different types, arising for
example in flow or mechanical simulations. In the case of the linear elasticity

only for developers of the affected software, but for the risks it poses to an
entire software ecosystem, e.g., Heartbleed vulnerability. Recent studies show
that developers are slow to respond to the threat of vulnerability, sometimes
taking four to eleven months to act. To ensure quick adoption and propagation
of a release that contains the fix (fixing release), we conduct an empirical
investigation to identify lags that may occur between the vulnerable release
and its fixing release (package-side fixing release). Through a preliminary
study of 231 package-side fixing release of npm projects on GitHub, we observe
that a fixing release is rarely released on its own, with up to 85.72% of the
bundled commits being unrelated to a fix. We then compare the package-side
fixing release with changes on a client-side (client-side fixing release).
Through an empirical study of the adoption and propagation tendencies of 1,290
package-side fixing releases that impact throughout a network of 1,553,325
releases of npm packages, we find that stale clients require additional
migration effort, even if the package-side fixing release was quick (i.e.,
package patch landing). Furthermore, we show the influence of factors such as
the branch that the package-side fixing release lands on and the severity of
vulnerability on its propagation. In addition to these lags we identify and
characterize, this paper lays the groundwork for future research on how to
mitigate lags in an ecosystem.

blazar ON 231 during the TeV outburst phase in 2008 June with observations
performed by Swift and XMM-Newton. The X-ray flux of the source, which was
significantly dominated by the soft photons (below $3-4$ keV), varies between
27$\%$ and 38$\%$ on day timescales, while mild variations were observed in the
optical/UV emissions. We found a maximum soft lag of $\sim 1$ hr between the UV
and soft X-ray bands, which can be understood if the magnetic field of the
emitting region is $\sim 5.6~ \delta^{-1/3}$ G. The $0.6-10$ keV spectra can be
well represented by a broken power-law model, which indicates the presence of
both synchrotron and inverse Compton components in the studied X-ray regime.
The synchrotron part of the SEDs constructed with simultaneous optical/UV and
X-ray data follows a log-parabolic shape. A time-resolved spectral analysis
shows that the break energy varies significantly between 2.4 and 7.3 keV with
the changing flux state of the source, and the similar variations of the
spectral slopes of the two components support the SSC scenario. The synchrotron
tail, following a log-parabolic function, shows that the peak frequency
($\nu_{p}$) varies by two orders of magnitude ($\sim 10^{14}-10^{16}$ Hz)
during the event. A significantly positive $E_{p}-\beta$ relation is observed
from both SED and time-resolved spectral analyses. The most feasible scenario
for the observed trend during the flaring event could be associated with a
magnetic-field-driven stochastic process evolving toward an equilibrium energy
level.

predictor for a distribution over $d$-dimensional input points and real-valued

where the sample is drawn i.i.d. from the input distribution, the least squares
solution for that sample can be viewed as the natural estimator of the optimum.
Unfortunately, this estimator almost always incurs an undesirable bias coming
from the randomness of the input points, which is a significant bottleneck in
model averaging. In this paper we show that it is possible to draw a non-i.i.d.
sample of input points such that, regardless of the response model, the least
squares solution is an unbiased estimator of the optimum. Moreover, this sample
can be produced efficiently by augmenting a previously drawn i.i.d. sample with
an additional set of $d$ points, drawn jointly according to a certain
determinantal point process constructed from the input distribution rescaled by
the squared volume spanned by the points. Motivated by this, we develop a
theoretical framework for studying volume-rescaled sampling, and in the process
prove a number of new matrix expectation identities. We use them to show that
for any input distribution and $\epsilon>0$ there is a random design consisting
of $O(d\log d+ d/\epsilon)$ points from which an unbiased estimator can be
constructed whose expected square loss over the entire distribution is bounded
by $1+\epsilon$ times the loss of the optimum. We provide efficient algorithms
for generating such unbiased estimators in a number of practical settings and
support our claims experimentally.

These seven states can decay into $J/\psi N$ and $\eta_c N$, and we use HQSS to

semi-honest secure communication-efficient two-party protocols. The core

in reducing the number of communication bits (in most cases). As an example, we

not match well in three dimensions. To resolve this contradiction, we perform
large scale simulations in two dimensions, and show that like in three

  Two issues in higher rank are that the transfer to the quasi-split form is
not always cuspidal and sometimes the congruences come from lower rank (e.g.,
are ""endoscopic""). We show our construction yields Eisenstein congruences with
non-endoscopic cuspidal automorphic forms on quasi-split unitary groups by
using certain unitary groups over division algebras. On the other hand, when
using unitary groups over fields, or other groups of Lie type, these Eisenstein
congruences typically appear to be endoscopic. This suggests a new way to see
higher weight Eisenstein congruences for GL(2), and leads to various
conjectures about GL(2) Eisenstein congruences.

congruences for Hilbert modular forms, and prove some special congruence mod p

forming, vanishing and reforming, creating a distribution of topologies which
we quantify in terms of a knot spectrum and its scaling law. We also find
results analogous to those in the wider literature, demonstrating that the

discontinuous finite elements are used to approximate discontinuous or nearly
discontinuous PDE solutions from the approximation point of view.
  For a simple step function, we explicitly compute its continuous and
discontinuous piecewise constant or linear projections on discontinuity matched
or non-matched meshes. For the simple discontinuity-aligned mesh case,
piecewise discontinuous approximations are always good. For the general
non-matched case, we explain that the piecewise discontinuous constant
approximation combined with adaptive mesh refinements is a good choice to
achieve accuracy without overshoots. For discontinuous piecewise linear
approximations, non-trivial overshoots will be observed unless the mesh is
matched with discontinuity. For continuous piecewise linear approximations, the
computation is based on a ""far-away assumption"", and non-trivial overshoots
will always be observed under regular meshes. We calculate the explicit
overshoot values for several typical cases. Numerical tests are conducted for a
singularly-perturbed reaction-diffusion equation and linear hyperbolic
equations to verify our findings in the paper. Also, we discuss the
$L^1$-minimization-based methods and do not recommend such methods due to their
similar behavior to $L^2$-based methods and more complicated implementations.

many protocols are proposed recently to improve the decentralization level, the
performance and the security of the blockchain. There are two challenging
issues when the blockchain is operating in practice. First, the outcomes of the
consensus algorithm are usually related to the incentive model, so whether each
participant's value has an equal probability of being chosen becomes essential.
However, the issues of fairness are not captured in the traditional security
definition of Byzantine agreement. Second, the blockchain should be resistant
to network failures, such as cloud services shut down or malicious attack,
while remains the high performance most of the time.
  This paper has two main contributions. First, we propose a novel notion
called fair validity for Byzantine agreement. Intuitively, fair validity
lower-bounds the expected numbers that honest nodes' values being decided if
the protocol is executed many times. However, we also show that any Byzantine
agreement could not achieve fair validity in an asynchronous network, so we
focus on synchronous protocols. This leads to our second contribution: we
propose a fair, responsive and partition-resilient Byzantine agreement protocol
tolerating up to 1/3 corruptions. Fairness means that our protocol achieves
fair validity. Responsiveness means that the termination time only depends on
the actual network delay instead of depending on any pre-determined time bound.
Partition-resilience means that the safety still holds even if the network is
partitioned, and the termination will hold if the partition is resolved.

act as relays for messages sent by the primary user, hence offering performance
improvement of primary transmissions, while at the same time obtaining more
transmission opportunities for their own data. In particular, assuming the
broadcast packet erasure model with feedback, we investigate the capacity of
the fundamental cooperative cognitive radio network which consists of one
primary and one secondary transmitter-receiver pairs. The primary transmitter
is the owner of the channel and as such, we intend to keep its operations
simple and to avoid increasing its storage requirements. Specifically, the
primary transmitter does not receive data sent by the secondary transmitter and
does not perform any coding operations. On the other hand, the secondary
transmitter can overhear primary transmissions and is allowed to perform any
coding operations. We develop an outer bound to the capacity of the fundamental
cooperative cognitive radio network under consideration. Then, we propose a
coding-scheduling algorithm suitable for this type of networks, which involves
only XOR network coding operations. The complexity of the scheduling decisions
of the proposed algorithm depends on the channel statistical parameters and
three cases, depending on the relations between channel erasure probabilities,
are distinguished. For the first two cases the rate region of the proposed
algorithm coincides with the developed capacity outer bound, hence the
algorithm is capacity achieving. For the third case, the rate region of the
proposed algorithm is not identical to the outer bound; however, numerical
results show that it is fairly close to the derived outer bound for a wide

other two dwarf novae SS Cyg and SU UMa. The standard disc instability model,

at an astonishing rate, user's demand for high-quality immersive contents
increases dramatically. Unlike traditional uniform artifacts, the distortions
within immersive contents could be non-uniform structure-related and thus are
challenging for commonly used quality metrics. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the representation of visual features can be extracted from multiple
levels of the hierarchy. Inspired by the hierarchical representation mechanism
in the human visual system (HVS), in this paper, we explore to adopt structural
representations to quantitatively measure the impact of such structure-related
distortion on perceived quality in FTV scenario. More specifically, a
bio-inspired full reference image quality metric is proposed based on 1)
low-level contour descriptor; 2) mid-level contour category descriptor; and 3)

into parts due to the treatment and due to the confounders. To achieve this
separation, practitioners often use external sources of randomness that only

constructed from treatment and IV that help estimate effects, called control
functions. We characterize general control functions for effect estimation in a
meta-identification result. Then, we show that structural assumptions on the

guaranteeing identification. To construct general control functions and

first stage called variational decoupling (VDE) constructs general control
functions by recovering the residual variation in the treatment given the IV.
Using VDE's control function, GCFN's second stage estimates effects via
regression. Further, we develop semi-supervised GCFN to construct general
control functions using subsets of data that have both IV and confounders
observed as supervision; this needs no structural treatment process
assumptions. We evaluate GCFN on low and high dimensional simulated data and on

recent years have seen rapid progress, with secure computation mechanisms such

Even so, the computational overhead incurred by processing speech data in the

computational overhead is then prohibitive, meaning that one must accept either
degraded performance (no score normalisation) or potential for privacy

privacy-preserving cohort score normalisation. Our solution is a cohort pruning
scheme based on secure multi-party computation which enables privacy-preserving

scientific method allows a clean separation, insofar as this is possible, of
the physical and philosophical aspects of the problem of outcomes in quantum
mechanics. The philosophical part of the problem is to explain why a closed
system has definite experimental outcomes. The physical part is to show
mathematically that there exists a limit in which the contradiction between
unitary Schroedinger dynamics and a reduction process leading to distinct
outcomes becomes negligible according to an explicitly stated criterion, and to
make this criterion as objective as possible. The physical problem is solved
here by redefining the notion of a quantum state and finding a suitable measure
for the change of state upon reduction. The appropriate definition of the
quantum state is not as a ray or density operator in Hilbert space, but rather
as an equivalence class consisting of all density operators in a given
subspace, the members of which all describe the same experimental outcome. For
systems containing only subsystems that are integrated with their environments,
these equivalence classes can be represented mathematically by projection
operators, and the resulting formalism is closely related to that used by von
Neumann to study the increase of entropy predicted by the second law of
thermodynamics. However, nearly isolated subsystems are reduced only
indirectly, as a consequence of their interaction with integrated subsystems.
The reduced states of isolated subsystems are the same conditional states used
in the definition of quantum discord. The key concepts of decoherence theory
can all be adapted to fit this definition of a quantum state, resulting in a
unified theory capable of resolving, in principle, all aspects of the quantum
measurement problem. The theory thus obtained is weakly objective but not
strongly objective.

directivity). This serves as a basis for spectral analysis of graphs, whereby
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graph Laplacian and adjacency matrices are

descriptors of graphs and in a generic way. Finally, a framework for vertex
clustering and graph segmentation is established based on graph spectral
representation (eigenanalysis) which illustrates the power of graphs in various
data association tasks. The supporting examples demonstrate the promise of
Graph Data Analytics in modeling structural and functional/semantic inferences.
At the same time, Part I serves as a basis for Part II and Part III which deal
with theory, methods and applications of processing Data on Graphs and Graph
Topology Learning from data.

not all model-translation errors are equal -- some are critical while others

a similar context. To solve both issues, we propose CAMIT, a novel method for
translating in an interactive environment. Our proposed method works with
critical revision instructions, therefore allows human to correct arbitrary
words in model-translated sentences. In addition, CAMIT learns from and softly
memorizes revision actions based on the context, alleviating the issue of
repeating mistakes. Experiments in both ideal and real interactive translation

  Optimisation",,,,,"eess.SY cs.MA cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Participation in residential energy demand response programs requires an
active role by the consumers. They contribute flexibility in how they use their
appliances as the means to adjust energy consumption, and reduce demand peaks,
possibly at the expense of their own comfort (e.g., thermal). Understanding the
collective potential of appliance-level flexibility for reducing demand peaks
is challenging and complex. For instance, physical characteristics of
appliances, usage preferences, and comfort requirements all influence consumer
flexibility, adoption, and effectiveness of demand response programs. To
capture and study such socio-technical factors and trade-offs, this paper
contributes a novel appliance-level flexible scheduling framework based on
consumers' self-determined flexibility and comfort requirements. By utilizing
this framework, this paper studies (i) consumers usage preferences across
various appliances, as well as their voluntary contribution of flexibility and
willingness to sacrifice comfort for improving grid stability, (ii) impact of
individual appliances on the collective goal of reducing demand peaks, and
(iii) the effect of variable levels of flexibility, cooperation, and
participation on the outcome of coordinated appliance scheduling. Experimental
evaluation using a novel dataset collected via a smartphone app shows that
higher consumer flexibility can significantly reduce demand peaks, with the
oven having the highest system-wide potential for this. Overall, the
cooperative approach allows for higher peak-shaving compared to non-cooperative
schemes that focus entirely on the efficiency of individual appliances. The
findings of this study can be used to design more cost-effective and granular
(appliance-level) demand response programs in participatory and decentralized
Smart Grids.

graph domain. While many approaches have been developed in classical graph
theory to cluster vertices and segment large graphs in a signal independent
way, signal localization based approaches to the analysis of data on graph
represent a new research direction which is also a key to big data analytics on
graphs. To this end, after an overview of the basic definitions in graphs and
graph signals, we present and discuss a localized form of the graph Fourier
transform. To establish an analogy with classical signal processing, spectral-
and vertex-domain definitions of the localization window are given next. The
spectral and vertex localization kernels are then related to the wavelet
transform, followed by a study of filtering and inversion of the localized
graph Fourier transform. For rigour, the analysis of energy representation and
frames in the localized graph Fourier transform is extended to the energy forms
of vertex-frequency distributions, which operate even without the need to apply
localization windows. Another link with classical signal processing is
established through the concept of local smoothness, which is subsequently
related to the particular paradigm of signal smoothness on graphs. This all
represents a comprehensive account of the relation of general vertex-frequency
analysis with classical time-frequency analysis, and important but missing link
for more advanced applications of graphs signal processing. The theory is
supported by illustrative and practically relevant examples.

filled with the liquid metal alloy GaInSn. We measure the internal temporal
correlations of the complex large-scale flow and distinguish between short-term
oscillations associated with a sloshing motion in the mid-plane as well as
varying orientation angles of the velocity close to the top/bottom plates and
the slow azimuthal drift of the mean orientation of the roll as a whole that
proceeds on an up to a hundred times slower time scale. The coherent LSC drives
a vigorous turbulence in the whole cell that is quantified by direct Reynolds
number measurements at different locations in the cell. The velocity increment
statistics in the bulk of the cell displays characteristic properties of
intermittent small-scale fluid turbulence. We also show that the impact of the
symmetry-breaking large-scale flow persists to small-scale velocity
fluctuations thus preventing the establishment of fully isotropic turbulence in
the cell centre. Reynolds number amplitudes depend sensitively on beam line
position in the cell such that different definitions have to be compared. The
global momentum and heat transfer scalings with Rayleigh number are found to
agree with those of direct numerical simulations and other laboratory

such as ALMA. ALMA's small field of view ($<15^{\prime\prime}$ at 350 GHz)
limits its mapping speed for large surveys. Instead, a single dish with a large
field of view such as the AtLAST concept can host large multi-element
instruments that can more efficiently map large portions of the sky. Small
aperture survey instruments (typically much smaller than $<3\times$ the size of
an interferometric array element) can mitigate this somewhat but lack the
resolution for accurate recovery of source location and have small collecting
areas. Furthermore, small aperture survey instruments do not provide sufficient
overlap in the spatial scales they sample to provide a complete reconstruction
of extended sources (i.e.\ the zero-spacing information is incomplete in
$u,v$-space.) The heterodyne instrumentation for the AtLAST telescope that we
consider here will take advantage of extensive developments in the past decade
improving the performance and pixel count of heterodyne focal plane arrays.
Such instrumentation, with higher pixel counts, has alredy begun to take
advantage of integration in the focal planes to increase packaging efficiency
over simply stacking modular mixer blocks in the focal plane. We extrapolate
from the current state-of-the-art to present concept first-generation
heterodyne designs for AtLAST.

observations are now pushing the redshift frontiers of galaxy formation studies
up to $z\sim9-11$ and beyond. Recent HST observations unveiled the presence of
a star-forming galaxy exhibiting the Lyman break at $\lambda_{\rm
obs}=1.47\pm0.01$ $\mu$m, i.e., a $z=11.09^{+0.08}_{-0.12}$ galaxy with a
stellar mass of $\sim10^9 M_\odot$, demonstrating that galaxy build-up was well
underway early in the epoch of reionization (EoR) at $z>10$. Targeted
spectroscopy of a lensed Lyman break galaxy uncovers the earliest metals known
to date up to $z=9.1096\pm0.0006$ by detecting the bright [OIII] 88~$\mu$m
nebular line, indicating the onset of star formation 250 million years after
the Big Bang, i.e., corresponding to a redshift of $z\sim15$. These latest
findings lead us to a number of key questions: How and when metal enrichment
happened in the EoR? What was the nature of the earliest-epoch star-forming
galaxies at $z=10-15$? What was the spatial distribution of such galaxies, and
what was the relation to the putative large-scale ionization bubbles during the
EoR? What were the dark-halo masses of such earliest-epoch star-forming
galaxies? To address all these questions, we need to uncover a statistically
large number of $z=10-15$ galaxies in the pre-reionization era. Here we argue
two possible pathways: (1) a wide-area, sensitive blind spectroscopic survey of
[OIII] 88 $\mu$m line-emitting galaxies at submillimeter wavelengths, and (2)
an ultra-wide-area, high-cadence photometric survey of transient sources at
radio-to-(sub)millimeter wavelengths, together with the immediate follow-up
spectroscopy with an ultra-wide-band spectrograph, to catch the pop-III
$\gamma$-ray bursts.

waves propagating in one direction. A wave with random initial conditions is
propagated using a forced-damped higher order Nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation
(NLS). During the wind episode, the wave action increases, the spectrum
broadens, the spectral mean shifts up and the Benjamin-Feir index (BFI) and the
kurtosis increase. Conversely, after the wind episode, the opposite occurs for
each quantity. The kurtosis of the wave height distribution is considered the
main parameter that can indicate whether rogue waves are likely to occur in a
sea state, and the BFI is often mentioned as a means to predict the kurtosis.
However, we find that while there is indeed a quadratic relation between these
two, this relationship is dependent on the details of the forcing and damping.
Instead, a simple and robust quadratic relation does exist between the kurtosis
and the bandwidth. This could allow for a single-spectrum assessment of the
likelihood of rogue waves in a given sea state. In addition, as the kurtosis
depends strongly on the damping and forcing coefficients, by combining the
bandwidth measurement with the damping coefficient, the evolution of the
kurtosis after the wind episode can be predicted.

dimensionless combination $R=\rho v_0^2/2\sigma_a$, where $\rho$ is the
suspension mass density, $v_0$ the swim speed and $\sigma_a$ the active stress.
Linear stability analysis shows that for small $R$ disturbances grow at a rate
linear in their wavenumber $q$, and that the dominant instability mode involves
twist. The resulting steady state in our numerical studies is isotropic
hedgehog-defect turbulence. Past a first threshold $R$ of order unity we find a
slower growth rate, of $O(q^2)$; the numerically observed steady state is {\it
phase-turbulent}: noisy but {\it aligned} on average. We present numerical
evidence in three and two dimensions that this inertia driven flocking
transition is continuous, with a correlation length that grows on approaching
the transition. For much larger $R$ we find an aligned state linearly stable to
perturbations at all $q$. Our predictions should be testable in suspensions of
mesoscale swimmers [D Klotsa, Soft Matter \textbf{15}, 8946 (2019)].

single and bilayer graphene in proximity to the topological insulator
Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Our approach is based on first-principles calculations, combined
with symmetry derived model Hamiltonians that capture the low-energy band
properties. We consider single and bilayer graphene on 1--3 quintuple layers of
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and extract orbital and proximity induced spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) parameters. We find that graphene gets significantly hole doped (350
meV), but the linear dispersion is preserved. The proximity induced SOC
parameters are about 1 meV in magnitude, and are of valley-Zeeman type. The
induced SOC depends weakly on the number of quintuple layers of Bi$_2$Se$_3$.
We also study the effect of a transverse electric field, that is applied across
heterostructures of single and bilayer graphene above 1 quintuple layer of
Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Our results show that band offsets, as well as proximity induced
SOC parameters can be tuned by the field. Most interesting is the case of
bilayer graphene, in which the band gap, originating from the intrinsic dipole
of the heterostructure, can be closed and reopened again, with inverted band
character. The switching of the strong proximity SOC from the conduction to the
valence band realizes a spin-orbit valve. Additonally, we find a giant increase
of the proximity induced SOC of about 200%, when we decrease the interlayer
distance between graphene and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ by only 10%. Finally, for a
different substrate material Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se, band offsets are significantly
different, with the graphene Dirac point located at the Fermi level, while the
induced SOC strength stays similar in magnitude compared to the Bi$_2$Se$_3$

of sepiolite concentration on the elastic modulus and the yield strength of the
solid and cellular nanocomposites. Single edge notch bend tests are conducted
to relate the fracture toughness of the solid and cellular nanocomposites to
sepiolite concentration. The relative modulus is independent of sepiolite
content to within material scatter when considering the complete porosity
range. In contrast, a mild enhancement of the relative modulus is observed by
the addition of sepiolite particles for the foamed nanocomposites with a
porosity close to 50 percent. The relative compressive strength of the cellular
nanocomposites mildly decreases as a function of sepiolite concentration. A
strong enhancement of the relative fracture toughness by the addition of
sepiolites is observed. The enhancement of the relative fracture toughness and
the relative modulus (at 50 percent porosity) can be attributed to an improved
dispersion of the particles due to foaming and the migration of micron sized
aggregates from the solid phase to the microcellular pores during foaming.

larger entities from which more information can be gathered. The merging
process is often implemented in form of a clustering algorithm. This article
describes a novel approach for first filtering out static background data

follows the same paradigm as the idea for data association itself: First,
clustering what is ought to belong together in a low dimensional parameter

evolution of supernova remnants and on the energy and momentum that they inject
into an inhomogeneous interstellar medium. We use 1D hydrodynamical
calculations and assume that the clouds are numerous enough that they can be
treated in the continuous limit. The destruction of embedded clouds adds mass
into the remnant, increasing its density and pressure, and decreasing its
temperature. The remnant cools more quickly, is less able to do PdV work on the
swept-up gas, and ultimately attains a lower final momentum (by up to a factor
of two or more). We thus find that the injection of momentum is more sensitive
to an inhomogeneous environment than previous work has suggested, and we
provide fits to our results for the situation where the cloud mass is not
limited. The behaviour of the remnant is more complex in situations where the
cloud mass is finite and locally runs out. In the case of multiple supernovae
in a clustered environment, later supernova explosions may encounter higher
densities than previous explosions due to the prior liberation of mass from
engulfed clouds. If the cloud mass is finite, later explosions may be able to
create a sustained hot phase when earlier explosions have not been able to.

Monoceros R2, harbors one of the closest such systems, making it an excellent
target for case studies. We investigate the morphology, stability and dynamical
properties of the hub-filament system on basis of 13CO and C18O observations
obtained with the IRAM-30m telescope and H2 column density maps derived from
Herschel dust emission observations. We identified the filamentary network and
characterized the individual filaments as either main (converging into the hub)
or secondary (converging to a main filament) filaments. The main filaments have
line masses of 30-100 Msun/pc and show signs of fragmentation. The secondary
filaments have line masses of 12-60 Msun/pc and show fragmentation only
sporadically. In the context of Ostriker's hydrostatic filament model, the main
filaments are thermally super-critical. If non-thermal motions are included,
most of them are trans-critical. Most of the secondary filaments are roughly
trans-critical regardless of whether non-thermal motions are included or not.
From the main filaments, we estimate a mass accretion rate of 10(-4)-10(-3)
Msun/pc into the hub. The secondary filaments accrete into the main filaments
with a rate of 0.1-0.4x10(-4) Msun/pc. The main filaments extend into the hub.
Their velocity gradients increase towards the hub, suggesting acceleration of
the gas. We estimate that with the observed infall velocity, the mass-doubling
time of the hub is ~2.5 Myr, ten times larger than the free-fall time,
suggesting a dynamically old region. These timescales are comparable with the
chemical age of the HII region. Inside the hub, the main filaments show a ring-
or a spiral-like morphology that exhibits rotation and infall motions. One

that the universal R-matrix of Yg gives rise to rational solutions of the
quantum Yang-Baxter equations on irreducible, finite-dimensional
representations of Yg. This result was recently extended by Maulik-Okounkov to
symmetric Kac-Moody algebras, and representations arising from geometry. We
show that this rationality ceases to hold for arbitrary finite-dimensional
representations, at least if one requires such solutions to be natural with
respect to the representation and compatible with tensor products.
Equivalently, the tensor category of finite-dimensional representations of Yg
does not admit rational commutativity constraints. We construct instead two
meromorphic commutativity constraints, which are related by a unitarity
condition. We show that each possesses an asymptotic expansion as s tends to
infinity, which has the same formal properties as Drinfeld's R(s), and
therefore coincides with the latter by uniqueness. In particular, we give an
alternative, constructive proof of the existence of the universal R-matrix of
Yg. Our construction relies on the Gauss decomposition R^+(s)R^0(s)R^-(s) of
R(s). The divergent abelian term R^0 was resummed on finite-dimensional
representations by the first two authors in arXiv:1403.5251. The main
ingredient of the present paper is the construction of R^+(s) and R^-(s). We
prove that they are rational functions on finite-dimensional representations,
and that they intertwine the standard coproduct of Yg and the deformed Drinfeld
coproduct introduced in arXiv:1403.5251.

and a set of jobs each with a processing time and a subset of eligible
machines. The goal is to find an assignment of the jobs to the machines
minimizing the makespan, that is, the maximum summed up processing time any
machine receives. Herein, jobs should only be assigned to those machines on
which they are eligible. It is well-known that there is no polynomial time
approximation algorithm with an approximation guarantee of less than 1.5 for
the restricted assignment problem unless P=NP. In this work, we show hardness
results for variants of the restricted assignment problem with particular types
of restrictions.
  In the case of interval restrictions the machines can be totally ordered such
that jobs are eligible on consecutive machines. We resolve the open question of
whether the problem admits a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) in the
negative (unless P=NP). There are several special cases of this problem known
to admit a PTAS.
  Furthermore, we consider a variant with resource restriction where each
machine has capacities and each job demands for a fixed number of resources. A
job is eligible on a machine if its demand is at most the capacity of the
machine for each resource. For one resource, this problem is known to admit a
PTAS, for two, the case of interval restrictions is contained, and in general,
the problem is closely related to unrelated scheduling with a low rank
processing time matrix. We show that there is no polynomial time approximation
algorithm with a rate smaller than 48/47 or 1.5 for scheduling with resource
restrictions with 2 or 4 resources, respectively, unless P=NP. All our results
can be extended to the so called Santa Claus variants of the problems where the
goal is to maximize the minimal processing time any machine receives.

a more and more fine grained hierarchy enabling increasingly more efficient

  In this paper we show how to identify an even more fine grained hierarchy

The translation stream is used to capture modality-invariant features of the

energy than the symmetric solution. The ground-state band structure and Fermi
surface can be well compared with the recent experimental results. Symmetry
analysis assigns these two new solutions to the $B_{1g}$ and $E_u$ irreducible
representations of the D$_{4h}$ point group. While the $B_{1g}$ Ising
nematicity has been widely discussed in the context of vestigial stripe
antiferromagnetic order, the two-component $E_u$ vector nematicity is beyond
previous theoretical discussion. Distinct from the $B_{1g}$ order, the $E_u$
order features mixing of the Fe $d$-orbitals and inversion symmetry breaking,
which lead to striking experimental consequences, e.g. missing of an electron
pocket.

the context of extended teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity theories using the $1+3$
covariant formalism. After a review of the background, gravitational field
equations of $f(T)$ gravity and the introduction of the covariant perturbation
variables, the usual scalar and harmonic decomposition have been performed, and
the analysis of the growth of the density contrasts in the quasi-static
approximation for two non-interacting fluids scenarios, namely torsion-dust and
torsion-radiation mixtures is presented for the generic $f(T)$ gravity theory.
Special applications to two classes of $f(T)$ gravity toy models, namely $f(T)
= \mu T_0 (T/T_0)^n$ and $f(T) = T + \mu T_0 (-T/T_0)^n$, have then been made
within the observationally viable regions of their respective parameter spaces,
and the growth of the matter density contrast for both torsion-dust and
torsion-radiation epochs of the Universe has been examined. The exact solutions
of the dust perturbations, with growing amplitudes in cosmic time, are obtained
for some limiting cases of n. Similarly, the long- and short-wavelength modes
in the torsion-radiation case are treated, with the amplitudes either
oscillating or monotonically growing with time. Overall, it is noted that
$f(T)$ models contain a richer set of observationally viable structure growth
scenarios that can be tested against up- and-coming observational data and can
accommodate currently known features of the large-scale structure power
spectrum in the general relativistic and $\Lambda$CDM limits.

However, modelling these aspects in MIR systems have been notoriously
challenging since emotion is an inherently abstract and subjective experience,
thus making it difficult to quantify or predict in the first place, and to make
sense of the predictions in the next. In an attempt to create a model that can
give a musically meaningful and intuitive explanation for its predictions, we
propose a VGG-style deep neural network that learns to predict emotional
characteristics of a musical piece together with (and based on)
human-interpretable, mid-level perceptual features. We compare this to
predicting emotion directly with an identical network that does not take into
account the mid-level features and observe that the loss in predictive
performance of going through the mid-level features is surprisingly low, on
average. The design of our network allows us to visualize the effects of
perceptual features on individual emotion predictions, and we argue that the
small loss in performance in going through the mid-level features is justified
by the gain in explainability of the predictions.

and host-to-site application scenarios can be supported which are the base for
virtual private networks (VPNs). While traditional VPNs require complex key
exchange protocols like IKE to set up and renew tunnel endpoints, P4-IPsec
benefits from an SDN controller to accomplish these tasks. One goal of this
experimental work is to investigate how well P4-IPsec can be implemented on
existing P4 switches. We present a prototype for the BMv2 P4 software switch,
evaluate its performance, and publish its source code on GitHub. We explain why
we could not provide a useful implementation with the NetFPGA SUME board. For
the Edgecore Wedge 100BF-32X Tofino-based switch, we presented two prototype
implementations to cope with a missing crypto unit. As another contribution of
this paper, we provide technological background of P4 and IPsec and give a
comprehensive review of security applications in P4, IPsec in SDN, and IPsec
data plane implementations. According to our knowledge, P4-IPsec is the first
implementation of IPsec for P4-based SDN.

for this task is to provide users of a spreadsheet program proactively with
recommendations for related structured content on the Web. At its core, the
related table recommendation task boils down to computing the similarity

analysis of spectroscopic/spectrophotometric observations with direct
measurements of the radii by interferometry methods for seven CP stars shows
that the radii agree within the limits of measurement errors, which proves
indirect spectroscopic analysis capable of proving reliable determinations of
the fundamental parameters of fainter Ap stars that are not possible to study

strong interactions, even between remote parts, are non-perturbative. Analysis
of multiparticle quantum correlations in a large system in the presence of
decoherence and external driving is especially topical. Still, scaling
behaviour of dynamics and related emergent phenomena are not yet well
understood. We investigate how the dynamics of a driven system of several
quantum elements (e.g., qubits or Rydberg atoms) changes with increasing number
of elements. Surprisingly, a two-element system exhibits chaotic behaviours.
For larger system sizes a highly stochastic, far from equilibrium, {\em
hyperchaotic} regime emerges. Its complexity systematically scales with the
size of the system, proportionally to the number of elements. Finally, we
demonstrate that these chaotic dynamics can be efficiently controlled by a
periodic driving field. The insights provided by our results indicate the
possibility of a reduced description for the behaviour of a large quantum
system in terms of the transitions between its qualitatively different
dynamical regimes, which are controlled by a relatively small number of
parameters, and may prove useful in the design, characterization and control of
large artificial quantum structures.

tracking personalized position to high temporal and spatial resolution is
difficult, most studies on human mobility patterns rely largely on mathematical
models. Seminal models which assume frequently visited locations tend to be
re-visited, reproduce a wide range of statistical features including collective
mobility fluxes and numerous scaling laws. However, these models cannot be
verified at a time-scale relevant to our daily travel patterns as most
available data do not provide the necessary temporal resolution. In this work,
we re-examined human mobility mechanisms via comprehensive cell-phone position
data recorded at a high frequency up to every second. We found that the next
location visited by users is not their most frequently visited ones in many
cases. Instead, individuals exhibit origin-dependent, path-preferential
patterns in their short time-scale mobility. These behaviors are prominent when
the temporal resolution of the data is high, and are thus overlooked in most
previous studies. Incorporating measured quantities from our high frequency
data into conventional human mobility models shows contradictory statistical
results. We finally revealed that the individual preferential transition
mechanism characterized by the first-order Markov process can quantitatively
reproduce the observed travel patterns at both individual and population levels
at all relevant time-scales.

localization of objects, but also the multimodal comprehension of context --
visual attributes (e.g., ``largest'', ``baby'') and relationships (e.g.,
``behind'') that help to distinguish the referent from other objects,
especially those of the same category. Due to the exponential complexity
involved in modeling the context associated with multiple image regions,
existing work oversimplifies this task to pairwise region modeling by multiple

reciprocal relation between the referent and context, i.e., either of them
influences estimation of the posterior distribution of the other, and thereby
the search space of context can be greatly reduced. In addition to reciprocity,
our framework considers the semantic information of context, i.e., the
referring expression can be reproduced based on the estimated context. We also
extend the model to unsupervised setting where no annotation for the referent

targeting algorithms that ensure a high throughput for the transactions
generated in IoT systems. Transactions are continuously appended to an acyclic
structure called tangle and each new transaction selects as parents two
existing transactions (called tips) that it approves. G-IOTA, a very recent
improvement of IOTA, targets to protect tips left behind offering hence a good
confidence level. However, this improvement had a cost: the use of an
additional tip selection mechanism which may be critical in IoT systems since
it needs additional energy consumption. In this paper we propose a new
metamorphic algorithm for tip selection that offers the best guaranties of both
IOTA and G-IOTA. Our contribution is two fold. First, we propose a
parameterized algorithm, E-IOTA, for tip selection which targets to reduce the
number of random walks executed in previous versions (IOTA and G-IOTA) while
maintaining the same security guaranties as IOTA and the same confidence level
and fairness with respect to tips selection as G-IOTA. Then we propose a formal
analysis of the security guaranties offered by E-IOTA against various attacks
mentioned in the original IOTA proposal (e.g. large weight attack, parasite
chain attack and splitting attack). Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge
this is the first formal analysis of the security guaranties of IOTA and its
derivatives.

formats that encode information both on the amplitude and on the phase of an
electromagnetic carrier. Coherent detection of such signals typically uses
rather complex receiver schemes, requiring a continuous-wave (c.w.) local
oscillator (LO) as a phase reference and a mixer circuit for spectral
down-conversion. In optical communications, the so-called Kramers-Kronig (KK)
scheme has been demonstrated to greatly simplify the receiver, reducing the
hardware to a single photodiode. In this approach, an LO tone is transmitted
along with the signal, and the amplitude and phase of the complex signal
envelope are reconstructed from the photocurrent by digital signal processing.
This reconstruction exploits the fact that the real and the imaginary part, or,
equivalently, the amplitude and the phase of an analytic signal are connected
by a KK-type relation. Here, we transfer the KK scheme to high-speed wireless
communications at THz carrier frequencies. We use a Schottky-barrier diode
(SBD) as a nonlinear element and generalize the theory of KK processing to
account for the non-quadratic characteristics of this device. Using 16-state
quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM), we transmit a net data rate of 115

the free streaming scale at very high redshift using a suite of unprecedentedly

of leaky-wave antennas, the optimal surface reactance modulation which is found
here ensures the absence of evanescent higher-order modes of the field
Floquet-wave expansion near the radiating surface. Thus, all the energy carried
by the surface wave is used for launching the single inhomogeneous plane wave
into space without accumulation of reactive energy in the higher-order modes.
It is shown that the resulting penetrable MTS exhibits variation from an
inductive to a capacitive reactance passing through a resonance. The present
formulation complements a previous paper of the authors in which a perfect
conversion from TM-polarized SW to TE-polarized LW was found for impenetrable
boundary conditions. Here, the solution takes into account the grounded slab

  Deep Learning",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The growing security threat of microarchitectural attacks underlines the
importance of robust security sensors and detection mechanisms at the hardware
level. While there are studies on runtime detection of cache attacks, a generic
model to consider the broad range of existing and future attacks is missing.
Unfortunately, previous approaches only consider either a single attack
variant, e.g. Prime+Probe, or specific victim applications such as
cryptographic implementations. Furthermore, the state-of-the art anomaly
detection methods are based on coarse-grained statistical models, which are not
successful to detect anomalies in a large-scale real world systems. Thanks to
the memory capability of advanced Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) algorithms,
both short and long term dependencies can be learned more accurately.
Therefore, we propose FortuneTeller, which for the first time leverages the
superiority of RNNs to learn complex execution patterns and detects unseen
microarchitectural attacks in real world systems. FortuneTeller models benign
workload pattern from a microarchitectural standpoint in an unsupervised
fashion, and then, it predicts how upcoming benign executions are supposed to
behave. Potential attacks and malicious behaviors will be detected
automatically, when there is a discrepancy between the predicted execution
pattern and the runtime observation. We implement FortuneTeller based on the
available hardware performance counters on Intel processors and it is trained
with 10 million samples obtained from benign applications. For the first time,
the latest attacks such as Meltdown, Spectre, Rowhammer and Zombieload are
detected with one trained model and without observing these attacks during the
training. We show that FortuneTeller achieves F-score of 0.9970.

the argument that taking a structured, abstract approach can pay dividends. A
motivating example is the scaling group of a locally compact quantum group
$\mathbb G$ and the fact that the inclusion $C_0(\mathbb G) \rightarrow
L^\infty(\mathbb G)$ intertwines the relevant scaling groups. Under this
general setup, of an inclusion of a $C^*$-algebra into a von Neumann algebra
intertwining automorphism groups, we show that the graphs of the analytic
generators, despite being only non-self-adjoint operator algebras, satisfy a
Kaplansky Density style result. The dual picture is the inclusion $L^1(\mathbb

establishes models of agent and Q-network for deriving a multi-asset trading

fundamental source of information on the collective emission of cosmic sources.
  Aims. At infrared wavelengths, however, these measurements are precluded by
the overwhelming dominance from Interplanetary Dust emission and the Galactic
infrared foreground. Only at $\lambda > 300 \ \mu$m, where the foregrounds are
minimal, has the Infrared EBL (IR EBL) been inferred from analysis of the COBE
maps. The present paper aims to assess the possibility of evaluating the IR EBL
from a few $\mu$m up to the peak of the emission at >100 $\mu$m using an
indirect method that avoids the foreground problem.
  Methods. To this purpose we exploit the effect of pair-production from
gamma-gamma interaction by considering the highest energy photons emitted by
extragalactic sources and their interaction with the IR EBL photons. We
simulate observations of a variety of low redshift emitters with the
forthcoming Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays (CTA in
particular) and water Cherenkov observatories (LHAASO, HAWC, SWGO) to assess
their suitability to constrain the EBL at such long wavelengths.
  Results. We find that, even under the most extremely favorable conditions of
huge emission flares, extremely high-energy emitting blazars are not very
useful for our purpose because they are much too distant (>100 Mpc the nearest
ones, MKN 501 and MKN 421). Observations of more local Very High Energy (VHE)
emitting AGNs, like low-redshift radio galaxies (M87, IC 310, Centaurus A), are
better suited and will potentially allow us to constrain the EBL up to $\lambda
\simeq 100\ \mu$m.

high-energy storage rings with emittance values of 10 pmrad. It is presently
expected that a storage ring with these low emittance values will reach
diffraction limit at hard X-rays. Simulations of coherence properties were
performed with the XRT software and analytical approach for different photon
energies from 500 eV to 50 keV. It was demonstrated that a minimum photon
emittance (diffraction limit) reached at such storage rings is
{\lambda}/2{\pi}. Using mode decomposition we showed that at the parameters of
the storage ring considered in this work, diffraction limit will be reached for
soft X-ray energies of 500 eV. About ten modes will contribute to the radiation
field at 12 keV photon energy and even more modes give a contribution at higher
photon energies. Energy spread effects of the electron beam in a low emittance
storage ring were analysed in detail. Simulations were performed at different
relative energy spread values from zero to 0.2%. We observed a decrease of the
degree of coherence with an increase of the relative energy spread value. Our
analysis shows that to reach diffraction limit for high photon energies
electron beam emittance should go down to 1 pmrad and below.

(esdM), and ultra-subdwarfs (usdM) with the X-shooter spectrograph on the

wide range of metallicities, gravities, and effective temperatures to infer the
physical properties for the whole M dwarf sequence (M0--M9.5) at sub-solar
metallicities and constrain the latest state-of-the-art atmospheric models.
  The BT-Settl models reproduce well the observed spectra across the 450-2500
nm wavelength range except for a few regions. We find that the best fits are
obtained for gravities of log(g) = 5.0-5.5 dex for the three metal classes. We
infer metallicities of [Fe/H] = -0.5, -1.5, and -2.0+/-0.5 dex and effective

to be warmer by about 200+/-100 K and exhibit higher gravity than their
solar-metallicity counterparts. We derive abundances of several elements (Fe,

moderate redshifts, z\sim 2-3, we find that such models produce a poor fit to
the observed fluctuations while simultaneously overproducing the local black

$X$ is regular and proper over $R$, this gives 1-to-1 correspondences between
bounded weights structures on $C$ and the classes of those bounded

operating on each query term independently, these otherwise computationally
intensive models become amenable to offline precomputation---dramatically
reducing the cost of query evaluations employing state-of-the-art neural

Furthermore, at some layer interfaces, very thin surfaces such as good
conductor surfaces and metasurfaces can be deposited to achieve desired

this work, the 3D SNMM method is further extended from a single interface to
multiple layers so that the electromagnetic propagation and scattering in the

transmission matrices by using the eigenmode expansions in the transverse
directions. Therefore, it effectively reduces the original 3D problem into a
series of 2D eigenvalue problems for periodic structures. We apply this method

Molecular source localization finds its applications in future healthcare

distinct methods which both utilize (the peak of) the channel impulse response
measurements to uniquely localize the source, under assumption that the
molecular source of interest lies within the open convex-hull of the
sensor/anchor nodes. The first method is a one-shot, triangulation-based
approach which estimates the unknown location of the molecular source using
least-squares method. The corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is also derived.
The second method is an iterative approach, which utilizes gradient descent law
to minimize a non-convex cost function. Simulation results reveal that the
triangulation-based method performs very close to the CRB, for any given
signal- to-noise ratio. Additionally, the gradient descent-based method

mainly due to unavoidable measurement noise and signal distortion. Thus, using
conventional data-driven approaches to build a reliable discriminative model,
and further applying this identified surrogate to uncertainty analysis remains
to be very challenging. A deep learning approach is presented to provide
predictions based on limited and noisy data. To address noise perturbation, the
Bayesian learning method that naturally facilitates an automatic updating
mechanism is considered to quantify and propagate model uncertainties into
predictive quantities. Specifically, hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) is
first adopted to describe model uncertainties, which allows the prior
assumption to be less subjective, while also makes the proposed surrogate more
robust. Next, the Bayesian inference is seamlessly integrated into the DL
framework, which in turn supports probabilistic programming by yielding a
probability distribution of the quantities of interest rather than their point
estimates. Variational inference (VI) is implemented for the posterior
distribution analysis where the intractable marginalization of the likelihood
function over parameter space is framed in an optimization format, and
stochastic gradient descent method is applied to solve this optimization
problem. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain an unbiased
estimator in the predictive phase of Bayesian inference, where the proposed
Bayesian deep learning (BDL) scheme is able to offer confidence bounds for the
output estimation by analyzing propagated uncertainties. The effectiveness of
Bayesian shrinkage is demonstrated in improving predictive performance using
contaminated data, and various examples are provided to illustrate concepts,
methodologies, and algorithms of this proposed BDL modeling technique.

languages like C/C++ have been among the leading causes for software

spatial safety by checking if every access to array elements are within the
corresponding array bounds. However, it often results in high execution time
overhead due to the cost of executing the instructions associated with bounds
checking. To mitigate this problem, redundant bounds check elimination
techniques are needed. In this paper, we propose CHOP, a Convex Hull
OPtimization based framework, for bypassing redundant memory bounds checking
via profile-guided inferences. In contrast to existing check elimination
techniques that are limited by static code analysis, our solution leverages a
model-based inference to identify redundant bounds checking based on runtime
data from past program executions. For a given function, it rapidly derives and
updates a knowledge base containing sufficient conditions for identifying
redundant array bounds checking. We evaluate CHOP on real-world applications
and benchmark (such as SPEC) and the experimental results show that on average
80.12% of dynamic bounds check instructions can be avoided, resulting in
improved performance up to 95.80% over SoftBound.

by intense femtosecond laser pulses at 800 nm is studied. With laser
intensities under the ablation threshold (a few 10 TW/cm\textsuperscript{2}),
electrons with unexpected energies in excess of 40-50 eV are observed by using
the photoemission spectroscopy. A theoretical approach based on the Boltzmann
kinetic equation including state-of-the-art modeling for various particles
interactions is developed to interpret these experimental observations. A
direct comparison shows that both electron heating in the bulk and a further
laser field acceleration after ejection from the material contribute
equivalently to the final electron energy gain. The electron heating in the
bulk is shown to be significantly driven by a non-collisional process, i.e.
direct multiphoton transitions between sub-bands of the conduction band. This
work also sheds light on the contribution of the standard electron
excitation/relaxation collisional processes, providing a new baseline to study
the electron dynamics in dielectric materials and associated applications as
laser material structuring.

  Hyaluronidase Injection for Electroporation Protocol",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The definition of an innovative therapeutic protocol requires the fine tuning
of all the involved operations in order to maximize the efficiency. In some
cases, the price of the experiments, or their duration, represents a great
obstacle and the full potential of the protocol risks to be reduced or even
hidden by a non-optimal application.
  The implementation of a numerical model of the protocol may represent the
solution, allowing a systematic exploration of all the different alternatives,
shedding the light on the most promising combination and also identifying the
key elements/parameters.
  In this paper, the injection of a plasmid, preceded by a hyaluronidase
injection, is simulated through a mathematical model. Some key elements of the
administration protocol are identified by means of a mathematical optimization
procedure, maximizing the efficacy of the therapy. As a side effect of the
extensive investigation, robust solutions able to reduce the effects of human
errors in the administration are also obtained.

Thus, fault diagnosis and troubleshooting are conducted at the deployment site.
Currently, WSN operators lack dedicated tools that aid them in this process.
Therefore, we introduce EyeSec, a tool for WSN monitoring and maintenance in
the field. An Augmented Reality Device (AR Device) identifies sensor nodes
using optical markers. Portable Sniffer Units capture network traffic and
extract information. With those data, the AR Device network topology and data
flows between sensor nodes are visualized. Unlike previous tools, EyeSec is
fully portable, independent of any given infrastructure and does not require
dedicated and expensive AR hardware. Using passive inspection only, it can be
retrofitted to already deployed WSNs. We implemented a proof of concept on
low-cost embedded hardware and commodity smart phones and demonstrate the usage
of EyeSec within a WSN test bed using the 6LoWPAN transmission protocol.

the S-type I-V characteristic implemented using the classic FitzHugh-Nagumo and
FitzHugh-Rinzel models. Using the proposed simplified electrical circuits
allows the modeling of the integrate-and-fire neuron and burst oscillation
modes with the emulation of the mammalian cold receptor patterns. The circuits
were studied using the experimental I-V characteristic of an NbO2 switch with a
stable section of negative differential resistance (NDR) and a VO2 switch with
an unstable NDR, considering the temperature dependences of the threshold
characteristics. The results are relevant for modern neuroelectronics and have
practical significance for the introduction of the neurodynamic models in
circuit design and the brain-machine interface. The proposed systems of
differential equations with the piecewise linear approximation of the S-type
I-V characteristic may be of scientific interest for further analytical and
numerical research and development of neural networks with artificial
intelligence.

manifold is an important task because it determines which classical processes
are dynamically forbidden. Conserved quantities play an important role in
solving geodesic equations of a general spacetime manifold. Furthermore,
knowing all possible conserved quantities of a system tells about the hidden
symmetries of that system since, conserved quantities are deeply connected with
the symmetries of the system, which are very important in their own right.
Conserved quantities are also useful to capture certain features of spacetime
manifold for an asymptotic observer. In this article, we show the existence of
these conserved charges and their algebra for a class of dynamical systems in a
generic curved spacetime.
