text analytics. The opinion-mining experts are focusing on the development of
emotion detection applications as they have received considerable attention of
online community including users and business organization for collecting and
interpreting public emotions. However, most of the existing works on emotion
detection used less efficient machine learning classifiers with limited
datasets, resulting in performance degradation. To overcome this issue, this
work aims at the evaluation of the performance of different machine learning

performance of different machine learning classifiers in terms of different
evaluation metrics like precision, recall ad f-measure. Finally, a classifier
with the best performance is recommended for the emotion classification.

addition, our trained embeddings can also be binarized for efficient storage

evaluations on offline metrics, user studies, and online A/B experiments, we
demonstrate that our proposed unified embedding improves both relevance and

In this paper, we developed a method to identify bias and strategic behavior in

of the Bloch-Torrey equation by finite elements is a more recently developed
approach for this purpose, in contrast to random walk simulations, which has a
longer history. While finite elements discretization is more difficult to
implement than random walk simulations, the approach benefits from a long
history of theoretical and numerical developments by the mathematical and
engineering communities. In particular, software packages for the automated
solutions of partial differential equations using finite elements
discretization, such as FEniCS, are undergoing active support and development.
However, because diffusion MRI simulation is a relatively new application area,
there is still a gap between the simulation needs of the MRI community and the
available tools provided by finite elements software packages. In this paper,
we address two potential difficulties in using FEniCS for diffusion MRI
simulation. First, we simplified software installation by the use of FEniCS
containers that are completely portable across multiple platforms. Second, we
provide a portable simulation framework based on Python and whose code is open
source. This simulation framework can be seamlessly integrated with cloud
computing resources such as Google Colaboratory notebooks working on a web
browser or with Google Cloud Platform with MPI parallelization. We show
examples illustrating the accuracy, the computational times, and parallel
computing capabilities. The framework contributes to reproducible science and
open-source software in computational diffusion MRI with the hope that it will
help to speed up method developments and stimulate research collaborations.

production through neutrino spallation in supernovae. The latter, known as the
$\nu$-process, is an important source for B11, and may contribute to the

self-consistently the evolution of the Li, Be, and B isotopes. We include
massive star production of F, as well as contributions from AGB stars, and the

normalize the $\nu$-process using the observed B11/B10 ratio as a constraint.
As a consequence, we are able to determine the relative importance of each

recent transmission technology studies. Herein, energy storage modeling is one
of the crucial design benchmarks that must be treated carefully. Understanding
the energy storage dynamics and the throughput levels is essential especially
for communication systems in which the performance depends solely on harvested
energy. While energy outages should be avoided, energy overflows should also be
prevented in order to utilize all harvested energy. Hence, a simple, yet
comprehensive, analytical model that can represent the characteristics of a
general class of EH wireless communication systems needs to be established. In
this paper, invoking tools from large deviation theory along with Markov
processes, a firm connection between the energy state of the battery and the
data transmission process over a wireless channel is established for an EH
transmitter. In particular, a simple exponential approximation for the energy
overflow probability is formulated, with which the energy decay rate in the
battery as a measure of energy usage is characterized. Then, projecting the
energy outages and supplies on a Markov process, a discrete state model is
established and an expression for the energy outage probability for given
energy arrival and demand processes is provided. Finally, under energy overflow
and outage constraints, the average data service (transmission) rate over the
wireless channel is obtained and the effective capacity of the system, which
characterizes the maximum data arrival rate at the transmitter buffer under
quality-of-service (QoS) constraints imposed on the data buffer overflow
probability, is derived.

$n=2.84\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ to $n=6\times 10^{14} $ cm$^{-2}$, the valence
band top is composed of up to three electronic bands hosting holes with
different effective masses. These bands resemble those of the undoped surface,
but they are heavily modified by the electric field and differ substantially
from a rigid doping picture. We calculate superconducting properties by
including the effects of charging of the slab and of the electric field on the
structural properties, electronic structure, phonon dispersion and
electron-phonon coupling. We find that at doping as large as $n=6\times 10^{14}
$ cm$^{-2}$, the electron-phonon interaction is $\lambda=0.81$ and
superconductivity emerges with $T_{\text{C}}\approx 29-36$K. Superconductivity
is mostly supported by in-plane diamond phonon vibrations and to a lesser
extent by some out-of-plane vibrations. The relevant electron-phonon scattering

merger of two galaxies can encounter a third galaxy, leading to a triple
merger, which would manifest as a triple AGN if all three SMBHs are
simultaneously accreting. Using high-spatial resolution X-ray, near-IR, and

triplet with mutual separations < 10 kpc in the advanced merger SDSS
J084905.51+111447.2 at z = 0.077. The system exhibits three nuclear X-ray
sources, optical spectroscopic line ratios consistent with AGN in each nucleus,
a high excitation near-IR coronal line in one nucleus, and broad Pa$\alpha$
detections in two nuclei. Hard X-ray spectral fitting reveals a high column
density along the line of sight, consistent with the picture of late-stage
mergers hosting heavily absorbed AGNs. Our multiwavelength diagnostics support
a triple AGN scenario, and we rule out alternative explanations such as star
formation activity, shock-driven emission, and emission from fewer than three
AGN. The dynamics of gravitationally bound triple SMBH systems can dramatically
reduce binary SMBH inspiral timescales, providing a possible means to surmount

strong intersection guarantees, which results in linear per-process
communication and computation complexity.
  We generalize the Byzantine reliable broadcast abstraction to the
probabilistic setting, allowing each of its properties to be violated with a
fixed, arbitrarily small probability. We leverage these relaxed guarantees in a
protocol where we replace quorums with stochastic samples. Compared to quorums,
samples are significantly smaller in size, leading to a more scalable design.
We obtain the first Byzantine reliable broadcast protocol with logarithmic
per-process communication and computation complexity.
  We conduct a complete and thorough analysis of our protocol, deriving bounds
on the probability of each of its properties being compromised. During our
analysis, we introduce a novel general technique we call adversary decorators.
Adversary decorators allow us to make claims about the optimal strategy of the
Byzantine adversary without having to make any additional assumptions. We also
introduce Threshold Contagion, a model of message propagation through a system
with Byzantine processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
formal analysis of a probabilistic broadcast protocol in the Byzantine fault
model. We show numerically that practically negligible failure probabilities

real-time. We have chosen to use polar coordinates to record the parameters of
the objects as well as an azimuthal equidistant projection to render the space
onto the screen because of the multiple useful properties they have. For
example, polar coordinate system works well with trigonometric calculations,
due to the distance from the reference point (analogous to origin in Cartesian
coordinates) being one of the coordinates by definition. Azimuthal equidistant
projection is not a typical projection, used for neither spherical nor
hyperbolic space, however one of the main features of our engine relies on it:
changing the curvature of the world in real-time without stopping the execution
of the application in order to re-calculate the world. This is due to the
projection properties that work identically for both spherical and hyperbolic
space, as can be seen in the Figure 1 above. We will also be looking at the

produces. Finally we will be discussing the limitations and possible

science and engineering, from estimating residual entropy in physical systems,
to bounding engineering reliability and solving combinatorial counting
problems. While quantum algorithms such as adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO)
and quantum approximate optimization (QAOA) can minimize Hamiltonians, they are
inadequate for counting ground states. We modify AQO and QAOA to count the
ground states of arbitrary classical spin Hamiltonians, including counting
ground states with arbitrary nonnegative weights attached to them. As a
concrete example, we show how our method can be used to count the weighted
fraction of edge covers on graphs, with user-specified confidence on the
relative error of the weighted count, in the asymptotic limit of large graphs.
We find the asymptotic computational time complexity of our algorithms, via
analytical predictions for AQO and numerical calculations for QAOA, and compare
with the classical optimal Monte Carlo algorithm (OMCS), as well as a modified
Grover's algorithm. We show that for large problem instances with small weights
on the ground states, AQO does not have a quantum speedup over OMCS for a fixed

for a simpler model will be worthwhile, and thus we do not go to the trouble of
searching for one. In this work, we ask an important practical question: can
accurate-yet-simple models be proven to exist, or shown likely to exist, before
explicitly searching for them? We hypothesize that there is an important reason
that simple-yet-accurate models often do exist. This hypothesis is that the
size of the Rashomon set is often large, where the Rashomon set is the set of
almost-equally-accurate models from a function class. If the Rashomon set is
large, it contains numerous accurate models, and perhaps at least one of them
is the simple model we desire. In this work, we formally present the Rashomon
ratio as a new gauge of simplicity for a learning problem, depending on a
function class and a data set. The Rashomon ratio is the ratio of the volume of
the set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space, and it is
different from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory.
Insight from studying the Rashomon ratio provides an easy way to check whether
a simpler model might exist for a problem before finding it, namely whether
several different machine learning methods achieve similar performance on the
data. In that sense, the Rashomon ratio is a powerful tool for understanding
why and when an accurate-yet-simple model might exist. If, as we hypothesize in
this work, many real-world data sets admit large Rashomon sets, the
implications are vast: it means that simple or interpretable models may often
be used for high-stakes decisions without losing accuracy.

fully resolved Navier-Stokes equations is limited by the immense computational
cost and is thus only feasible for relatively small domains. Model reduction
allows to decrease a model's complexity while maintaining an acceptable degree
of accuracy. Starting from a fully resolved three-dimensional numerical model,
which is compared to high-resolution micro-PIV experimental data obtained from
a previous study (Terzis et al.,2019), we perform a two-fold model reduction:
first, a quasi-3D model incorporating a wall friction term is successfully
compared to the fully resolved model. Second, we employ a pore-network model to
account for the porous part of the domain and couple it to the quasi-3D model
which still resolves the free-flow part of the domain (Weishaupt et al., 2019).
We have extended this coupling approach here to include slip velocities at the
pore throats intersecting with the free-flow domain. The proposed method is
simple, accurate and comes at no additional run-time penalty. The coupled model
deviates by less than 10 % from the other two model concepts. Several hours of
run-time was required for the three-dimensional model compared to eleven and
five minutes necessary for the quasi-3D and coupled model which highlights the
benefits of model reduction.

generically form minihalos of sub-planetary masses from white-noise
isocurvature density fluctuations if the Peccei-Quinn phase transition occurs
after inflation. Despite being denser than the larger halos formed out of
adiabatic fluctuations from inflation, axion minihalos have surface densities
much smaller than the critical value required for gravitational lensing to
produce multiple images or high magnification, and hence are practically
undetectable as lenses in isolation. However, their lensing effect can be
enhanced when superposed near critical curves of other lenses. We propose a
method to detect them through photometric monitoring of recently discovered
caustic transiting stars behind cluster lenses, under extreme magnification
factors $\mu \gtrsim 10^3$--$10^4$ as the lensed stars cross microlensing
caustics induced by intracluster stars. For masses of the first gravitationally
collapsed minihalos in the range $\sim 10^{-15}$--$10^{-8}\,h^{-1}\,M_\odot$,
we show that axion minihalos in galaxy clusters should collectively produce
subtle surface density fluctuations of amplitude $\sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$ on
projected length scales of $\sim 10$--$10^4\,$AU, which imprint irregularities
in the microlensing light curves of caustic transiting stars. We estimate that,
inside a cluster halo and over the age of the Universe, most of these minihalos

improvement, we investigate how several methodological choices can influence
inferences based on the bispectrum about galaxy bias and shot noise. We first
measure the real-space bispectrum of dark-matter haloes extracted from 298
N-body simulations covering a volume of approximately $1000 h^{-3}
\mathrm{Gpc}^3$. We then fit a series of theoretical models based on tree-level
perturbation theory to the numerical data. To achieve this, we estimate the
covariance matrix of the measurement errors by using 10,000 mock catalogues
generated with the Pinocchio code. We study how the model constraints are
influenced by the binning strategy for the bispectrum configurations and by the
form of the likelihood function. We also use Bayesian model-selection
techniques to single out the optimal theoretical description of our data. We
find that a three-parameter bias model combined with Poissonian shot noise is
necessary to model the halo bispectrum up to scales of $k_\mathrm{max}\lesssim
0.08 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, although fitting formulae that relate the bias
parameters can be helpful to reduce the freedom of the model without
compromising accuracy. Our data clearly disfavour local Eulerian and local
Lagrangian bias models and do not require corrections to Poissonian shot noise.
We anticipate that model-selection diagnostics will be particularly useful to
extend the analysis to smaller scales as, in this case, the number of model
parameters will grow significantly large.

clouds, which are accelerated by radiation pressure on dust relative to a hot,
diffuse background gas. We examine the relative effectiveness of acceleration
by ultraviolet and infrared radiation fields, both independently and acting
simultaneously on the same cloud. We study clouds that are optically thin to
infrared emission but with varying ultraviolet optical depths. Consistent with
previous work, we find relatively efficient acceleration and long cloud
survival times when the infrared band flux dominates over the ultraviolet flux.
However, when ultraviolet is dominant or even a modest percentage ($\sim
5-10$\%) of the infrared irradiating flux, it can act to compress the cloud,
first crushing it and then disrupting the outer layers. This drives mixing of
outer regions of the dusty gas with the hot diffuse background to the point
where most dust is not likely to survive or stay coupled to the gas. Hence, the
cold cloud is unable to survive for a long enough timescale to experience
significant acceleration before disruption even though efficient infrared
cooling keeps the majority of the gas close to radiative equilibrium
temperature ($T \lesssim 100$K). We discuss implications for observed systems,
concluding that radiation pressure driving is most effective when the light
from star-forming regions is efficiently reprocessed into the infrared.

binary (Canup 2005, 2011; Desch 2015). In the `hit-and-run' model, a lower mass
projectile barely hits the more massive Pluto, kicks up some debris, and
remains bound to Pluto (see also Asphaug et al. 2006). In a `graze-and-merge'
scenario, the projectile ejects substantial debris as it merges with Pluto (see
also Canup 2001). To investigate the graze-and-merge idea in more detail, we
consider the growth of Charon-mass objects within a circum-Pluto ring of
solids. Numerical calculations demonstrate that Charon analogs form rapidly
within a swarm of planetesimals with initial radii of 145-230 km. On time
scales of roughly 30-100 days, newly-formed Charon analogs have semimajor axes,
a = 5-6 Pluto radii, and orbital eccentricities, e = 0.1-0.3, similar to Charon
analogs that remain bound after hit-and-run collisions with Pluto. Although the
early growth of Charon analogs generates rings of small particles at a = 50-275
Pluto radii, ejection of several 145-230 km leftovers by the central
Pluto-Charon binary removes these small solids in 10-100 yr. Simple estimates
suggest small particles might survive the passage of 10-20 km objects ejected
by the central binary. Our results indicate that the Pluto-Charon circumbinary
satellite system was not formed by a graze-and-merge impact when the formation
of Charon within a circum-Pluto disk leads to the ejection of several 100-200
km particles through the orbital plane of the Pluto-Charon binary. If a growing
Charon ejects only much smaller particles, however, graze-and-merge impacts are
a plausible formation channel for the Pluto-Charon binary and an ensemble of
small, circumbinary satellites.

of $\sim6$ mJy, twice the level of the previously observed peak flux from
$>13,000$ measurements over 130 nights with the VLT and Keck Telescopes. We
also observe a factor of 75 change in flux over a 2-hour time span with no
obvious color changes between 1.6 $\mu$m and 2.1 $\mu$m. The distribution of
flux variations observed this year is also significantly different than the
historical distribution. Using the most comprehensive statistical model
published, the probability of a single night exhibiting peak flux levels
observed this year, given historical Keck observations, is less than $0.3\%$.
The probability to observe the flux levels similar to all 4 nights of data in
2019 is less than $0.05\%$. This increase in brightness and variability may
indicate a period of heightened activity from Sgr A* or a change in its
accretion state. It may also indicate that the current model is not sufficient

origins of Sgr A*'s unprecedented brightness may be from changes in the
accretion-flow as a result of the star S0-2's closest passage to the black hole

unconditionally secure cryptographic key, promises to play an important role in
the future of communication. For this reason such technique has attracted many
theoretical and experimental efforts, thus becoming one of the most prominent
quantum technologies of the last decades. The security of the key relies on
quantum mechanics and therefore requires the users to be capable of performing
quantum operations, such as state preparation or measurements in multiple
bases. A natural question is whether and to what extent these requirements can
be relaxed and the quantum capabilities of the users reduced. Here we
demonstrate a novel quantum key distribution scheme, where users are fully
classical. In our protocol, the quantum operations are performed by an
untrusted third party acting as a server, which gives the users access to a
superimposed single photon, and the key exchange is achieved via
interaction-free measurements on the shared state. We also provide a full
security proof of the protocol by computing the secret key rate in the
realistic scenario of finite-resources, as well as practical experimental
conditions of imperfect photon source and detectors. Our approach deepens the
understanding of the fundamental principles underlying quantum key distribution

peculiar, showing underabundances of refractory elements in their photospheres
that correlate with condensation temperature. The aim of this paper is to
investigate how accretion from a circumbinary disc can cause this phenomenon of
depletion and how this impacts the evolution of post-AGB stars. We used the
\texttt{MESA} code to evolve stars in the post-AGB phase, while including
accretion of metal-poor gas. We compared the models to a sample of 58 observed
disc-type post-AGB stars with chemical abundance data. For each of these stars,
we estimated the luminosity and the mass using the Gaia distance. We modelled
the accretion rate onto the binary from a viscously evolving disc for a range
of initial accretion rates and disc masses. We find that large initial
accretion rates ($\gtrsim 3\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$/yr) and large initial disc
masses ($\sim10^{-2}$ $M_\odot$) are needed to reproduce the observed depleted
post-AGB stars. Based on these high accretion rates, the evolution timescale of
post-AGB stars can be significantly extended by a factor between two and five.
We distinguish depletion patterns that are unsaturated (plateau profile) from
those that are saturated, and we expect that post-red giant branch (post-RGB)
stars are much more likely to show an unsaturated abundance pattern compared to
post-AGB stars. Finally, because of the slower evolution of the low-mass
post-RGB stars, we find that these systems can become depleted at lower
effective temperatures ($< 5000$ K). We conclude that accretion from a
circumbinary disc successfully accounts for the chemical peculiarity of
post-AGB stars.

(low-resolution to high-resolution) face recognition framework that leverages a
coupled generative adversarial network (GAN) structure with adversarial
training to find the hidden relationship between the low-resolution and
high-resolution images in a latent common embedding subspace. The coupled GAN
framework consists of two sub-networks, one dedicated to the low-resolution
domain and the other dedicated to the high-resolution domain. Each sub-network
aims to find a projection that maximizes the pair-wise correlation between the
two feature domains in a common embedding subspace. In addition to projecting
the images into a common subspace, the coupled network also predicts facial
attributes to improve the cross-resolution face recognition. Specifically, our
proposed coupled framework exploits facial attributes to further maximize the
pair-wise correlation by implicitly matching facial attributes of the low and
high-resolution images during the training, which leads to a more
discriminative embedding subspace resulting in performance enhancement for
cross-resolution face recognition. The efficacy of our approach compared with
the state-of-the-art is demonstrated using the LFWA, Celeb-A, SCFace and UCCS
datasets.

an estimation of their reliability based on their false positive probability.
We perform a search in the 3D-HST/CANDELS catalogs for the secondary CO

approaches to generate the minimum cardinality NAC set for MSSPs for various

uncertain parameters where the realizations occur instantaneously or the full

that leads to a DC current that is relevant for photo-voltaic applications. In
this work, we theoretically study this effect in the presence of
electron-phonon interactions. Using the response function formalism we find
that the non-linear optical response, in general, contains three operator
correlation functions, one of which is not ordered in time. This latter
correlator cannot be computed from equilibrium field theory. Using a
semiclassical approach instead, we show that the bulk photovoltaic effect can
be attributed to the dipole moment of the generated excitons. We then confirm
the validity of the semiclassical result (which agrees with the non-interacting
result) for non-linear DC response from a quantum master equation approach.
From this formalism we find that, in contrast to usual linear response, the
scattering rate has a strong implicit effect on the non-linear DC response.
Most interestingly, the semiclassical treatment shows that the non-linear DC
response for spatially inhomogeneous excitation profiles is strongly non-local
and must involve the aforementioned out-of-time-ordered correlators that cannot
be computed by equilibrium field theory.

data for Kepler Mira candidates also exhibit stable magnitude variations at the
brightest epochs while their multi-epoch spectra display strong Balmer emission
lines and weak molecular absorption at maximum-light. The stability of
maximum-light magnitudes for Miras possibly occurs due to the decrease in the
sensitivity to molecular bands at their warmest phase. At near-infrared
wavelengths, the Period-Luminosity relations of Miras display similar
dispersion at mean and maximum-light with limited time-series data in the
Magellanic Clouds. A kink in the Oxygen-rich Mira Period-Luminosity relations
is found at 300 days in the $VI$-bands which shifts to longer-periods ($\sim
350$~days) at near-infrared wavelengths. Oxygen-rich Mira Period-Luminosity
relations at maximum-light provide a relative distance modulus, $\Delta \mu =

uncertainty than the mean-light relations. The maximum-light properties of
Miras can be very useful for stellar atmosphere modeling and distance scale
studies provided their stability and the universality can be established in
other stellar environments in the era of extremely large telescopes.

analysis we infer the values of the binary parameters for the spectroscopic
SBHB candidates and evaluate the parameter degeneracies, representative of the
uncertainties intrinsic to such measurements. We find that as a population, the
SBHB candidates favor the average value of the semimajor axis corresponding to
$\log(a/M) \approx 4.20\pm 0.42$ and comparable mass ratios, $q>0.5$. If the
SBHB candidates considered are true binaries, this result would suggest that
there is a physical process that allows initially unequal mass systems to
evolve toward comparable mass ratios (e.g., accretion that occurs
preferentially onto the smaller of the black holes) or point to some, yet
unspecified, selection bias. Our method also indicates that the SBHB candidates
equally favor configurations in which the mini-disks are coplanar or misaligned
with the binary orbital plane. If confirmed for true SBHBs, this finding would
indicate the presence of a physical mechanism that maintains misalignment of
the mini-disks down to sub-parsec binary separations (e.g., precession driven
by gravitational torques). The probability distributions of the SBHB parameters
inferred for the observed SBHB candidates and our control group of AGNs are
statistically indistinguishable, implying that this method can in principle be
used to interpret the observed emission-line profiles once a sample of
confirmed SBHBs is available but cannot be used as a conclusive test of
binarity.

related to the evolutionary processes experienced by their host galaxies. In
particular, their radial distributions scale with several properties of the

archival data of several intermediate luminosity galaxies located in low
density environments. It was supplemented with available photometric data of
GCSs from the Virgo and Fornax clusters, resulting in a sample of almost 30
GCSs for which we fitted their radial profiles. The resulting overall
properties agree with those from previous studies, as we found that the
effective radius, extension and concentration of the GCS radial profiles
correlate with the stellar mass, effective radius and number of globular
clusters, presenting in some cases a bilinear relation. The extension also
correlates with the central velocity dispersion for central galaxies, but not
for satellites. From a statistical comparison with numerical simulations we

treatments are often evaluated by analyzing the average treatment effects and
risks. The stochastic efficiency with respect to a function is often employed
in such evaluations through ranking the certainty equivalents of each
treatment. The main challenge of using this method is gathering an adequate
number of observations to produce results with statistical power. However, in
many cases, only a limited number of trials are replicated in field
experiments, leaving an inadequate number of observations. In addition, this
method focuses only on the farmer's profit without incorporating the impact of
disease pressure on yield and profit. The objective of our study is to propose
a methodology to address the issue of an insufficient number of observations
using simulations and take into account the effect of disease pressure on yield
through a quantile regression model. We apply this method to the case of

database literature. We now count with several algorithms that are optimal in
the worst case, and many of them have been implemented and validated in
practice. However, the implementation of these algorithms often requires an
enhanced indexing structure: to achieve optimality we either need to build
completely new indexes, or we must populate the database with several
instantiations of indexes such as B$+$-trees. Either way, this means spending
an extra amount of storage space that may be non-negligible.
  We show that optimal algorithms can be obtained directly from a
representation that regards the relations as point sets in variable-dimensional
grids, without the need of extra storage. Our representation is a compact quad
tree for the static indexes, and a dynamic quadtree sharing subtrees (which we
dub a qdag) for intermediate results. We develop a compositional algorithm to
process full join queries under this representation, and show that the running
time of this algorithm is worst-case optimal in data complexity. Remarkably, we
can extend our framework to evaluate more expressive queries from relational
algebra by introducing a lazy version of qdags (lqdags). Once again, we can
show that the running time of our algorithms is worst-case optimal.

and continuous Galerkin (CG) schemes for the solution of a broad class of
physical systems described by Hamiltonian evolution equations. These systems
often arise in fluid mechanics (incompressible Euler equations) and plasma
physics (Vlasov--Poisson equations and gyrokinetic equations), for example. The
dynamics is described by a distribution function that evolves given a
Hamiltonian and a corresponding Poisson bracket operator, with the Hamiltonian
itself computed from field equations. Hamiltonian systems have several
conserved quantities, including the quadratic invariants of total energy and
the $L_2$ norm of the distribution function. For accurate simulations one must
ensure that these quadratic invariants are conserved by the discrete scheme. We
show that using a discontinuous Galerkin scheme to evolve the distribution
function and ensuring that the Hamiltonian lies in its continuous subspace
leads to an energy-conserving scheme in the continuous-time limit. Further, the
$L_2$ norm is conserved if central fluxes are used to update the distribution
function, but decays monotonically when using upwind fluxes. The conservation
of density and $L_2$ norm is then used to show that the entropy is a
non-decreasing function of time. The proofs shown here apply to any Hamiltonian
system, including ones in which the Poisson bracket operator is non-canonical
(for example, the gyrokinetic equations). We demonstrate the ability of the
scheme to solve the Vlasov--Poisson and incompressible Euler equations in 2D

  Channels","to appear on IEEE TVT",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Radio frequency sources are observed at a fusion center via sensor
measurements made over slow flat-fading channels. The number of sources may be
larger than the number of sensors, but their activity is sparse and
intermittent with bursty transmission patterns. To account for this, sources
are modeled as hidden Markov models with known or unknown parameters. The
problem of blind source estimation in the absence of channel state information
is tackled via a novel algorithm, consisting of a dictionary learning (DL)
stage and a per-source stochastic filtering (PSF) stage. The two stages work in
tandem, with the latter operating on the output produced by the former. Both
stages are designed so as to account for the sparsity and memory of the
sources. To this end, smooth LASSO is integrated with DL, while the
forward-backward algorithm and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm are
leveraged for PSF. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can enhance the
detection and the estimation performance of the sources, and that it is robust
to the sparsity level.

The proposed method is model-free and covers a wide range of dynamic networks.
The key idea behind our approach is to effectively utilize the network
structure in designing change-point detection algorithms. This is done via an
initial step of graphon estimation, where we propose a modified neighborhood
smoothing~(MNBS) algorithm for estimating the link probability matrices of a
dynamic network. Based on the initial graphon estimation, we then develop a
screening and thresholding algorithm for multiple change-point detection in
dynamic networks. The convergence rate and consistency for the change-point
detection procedure are derived as well as those for MNBS. When the number of
nodes is large~(e.g., exceeds the number of temporal points), our approach
yields a faster convergence rate in detecting change-points comparing with an
algorithm that simply employs averaged information of the dynamic network
across time. Numerical experiments demonstrate robust performance of the
proposed algorithm for change-point detection under various types of dynamic
networks, and superior performance over existing methods is observed. A real
data example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and practical impact
of the procedure.

nonparametric regression of H\""{o}lder functions on low-dimensional manifolds

Riemannian manifold isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^D$, with sub-gaussian

$n^{-\frac{2(s+\alpha)}{2(s+\alpha) + d}}\log^3 n$. This result shows that deep
ReLU networks give rise to a fast convergence rate depending on the data

irreversible processes in which a system is driven out of equilibrium according

differences and expectation values. Estimation has previously been improved by
considering data collected from the reverse process, which starts in
equilibrium in the final thermodynamic state of the forward process and is
driven according to the time-reversed protocol. Here, we develop a
theoretically rigorous statistical estimator for nonequilibrium path-ensemble
averages specialized for symmetric protocols, in which forward and reverse
processes are identical. The estimator is tested with a number of model
systems: a symmetric 1D potential, an asymmetric 1D potential, the unfolding of
deca-alanine, separating a host-guest system, and translocating a potassium ion
through a gramicidin A ion channel. When reconstructing free energies using
data from symmetric protocols, the new estimator outperforms existing rigorous
unidirectional and bidirectional estimators, converging more quickly and
resulting in smaller error. However, in most cases, using the bidirectional
estimator with data from a forward and reverse pair of asymmetric protocols
outperforms the corresponding symmetric protocol and estimator with the same
amount of simulation time. Hence, the new estimator is only recommended when
the bidirectional estimator is not feasible or is expected to perform poorly.
The symmetric estimator has similar performance to a unidirectional protocol of
half the length and twice the number of trajectories.

multiplicity, using the ALICE detector at the LHC. The production rates of
$\rm{K}^{0}_{S}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, and $\Omega$ increase with the multiplicity
faster than what is reported for inclusive charged particles. The increase is
found to be more pronounced for hadrons with a larger strangeness content.
Possible auto-correlations between the charged particles and the strange
hadrons are evaluated by measuring the event-activity with charged particle
multiplicity estimators covering different pseudorapidity regions. When
comparing to lower energy results, the yields of strange hadrons are found to
depend only on the mid-rapidity charged particle multiplicity. Several features
of the data are reproduced qualitatively by general purpose QCD Monte Carlo

to enabling robotic platforms to perform higher-level decision making.
Detection of already visited locations is one of the primary ways in which map
consistency is maintained, especially in situations where external positioning
systems are unavailable or unreliable. Mapping in 2D is an important field in
robotics, largely due to the fact that man-made environments such as warehouses
and homes, where robots are expected to play an increasing role, can often be
approximated as planar. Place recognition in this context remains challenging:
2D lidar scans contain scant information with which to characterize, and
therefore recognize, a location. This paper introduces a novel approach aimed
at addressing this problem. At its core, the system relies on the use of the
distance function for representation of geometry. This representation allows
extraction of features which describe the geometry of both surfaces and
free-space in the environment. We propose a feature for this purpose. Through
evaluations on public datasets, we demonstrate the utility of free-space in the
description of places, and show an increase in localization performance over a
state-of-the-art descriptor extracted from surface geometry.

multiple errors occur. Employing this technique, we show that we can directly
resolve transmon gate errors at the level of one part in $10^3.$ Extending this

encoded in a bosonic mode and detected with a transmon ancilla, implementing a

assignments are made based on a sequence of repeated readouts, further reducing
the overall infidelity. This approach is quite general and several encodings
are studied; the codewords are more distinguishable when the distance between
them is increased with respect to photon loss. The tradeoff between multiple

points, different identity documents $etc$. The importance of each image is
usually considered either equal or based on a quality assessment of that image
independent of other images and/or videos in that image set. How to model the
relationship of orderless images within a set remains a challenge. We address
this problem by formulating it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in a latent
space. Specifically, we first propose a dependency-aware attention control
(DAC) network, which uses actor-critic reinforcement learning for attention
decision of each image to exploit the correlations among the unordered images.
An off-policy experience replay is introduced to speed up the learning process.
Moreover, the DAC is combined with a temporal model for videos using divide and
conquer strategies. We also introduce a pose-guided representation (PGR) scheme
that can further boost the performance at extreme poses. We propose a
parameter-free PGR without the need for training as well as a novel metric
learning-based PGR for pose alignment without the need for pose detection in
testing stage. Extensive evaluations on IJB-A/B/C, YTF, Celebrity-1000 datasets

Unfortunately these techniques have been shown to have poor predictive power

perturbations that can cause an individual to lose stability during motion. To
address this limitation, the recently proposed Stability Basin (SB) aims to
characterize the set of perturbations that will cause an individual to fall
under a specific motor control strategy. The SB is defined as the set of
configurations that do not lead to failure for an individual under their chosen
control strategy. This paper presents a novel method to compute the SB and the
first experimental validation of the SB with an 11-person perturbative STS
experiment involving forwards or backwards pulls from a motor-driven cable. The
individually-constructed SBs are used to identify when a trial fails, i.e.,
when an individual must switch control strategies (indicated by a step or sit)
to recover from a perturbation. The constructed SBs correctly predict the
outcome of trials where failure was observed with over 90% accuracy, and
correctly predict the outcome of successful trials with over 95% accuracy. The
SB was compared to three other methods and was found to estimate the stable
region with over 45% more accuracy in all cases. This study demonstrates that
SBs offer a novel model-based approach for quantifying stability during motion,
which could be used in physical therapy for individuals at risk of falling.

modern neural networks. It starts with a large learning rate and then decays it
multiple times. It is empirically observed to help both optimization and
generalization. Common beliefs in how lrDecay works come from the optimization
analysis of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent: 1) an initially large learning rate
accelerates training or helps the network escape spurious local minima; 2)
decaying the learning rate helps the network converge to a local minimum and
avoid oscillation. Despite the popularity of these common beliefs, experiments
suggest that they are insufficient in explaining the general effectiveness of
lrDecay in training modern neural networks that are deep, wide, and nonconvex.
We provide another novel explanation: an initially large learning rate
suppresses the network from memorizing noisy data while decaying the learning
rate improves the learning of complex patterns. The proposed explanation is
validated on a carefully-constructed dataset with tractable pattern complexity.
And its implication, that additional patterns learned in later stages of
lrDecay are more complex and thus less transferable, is justified in real-world
datasets. We believe that this alternative explanation will shed light into the
design of better training strategies for modern neural networks.

a Schwarzschild Black Hole on the motion of charged particles are investigated
in this work. Using the weak electromagnetic field approximation, we discuss
the non-minimal coupling between magnetic fields and gravity caused by the
vacuum polarization and study the equations of motion for the case of a
magnetic field configuration which asymptotically approaches a dipole magnetic
field. It is shown that the presence of non-minimal coupling can significantly
influence the motion of charged particles around Black Holes. In particular,
the vacuum polarization effect, leading to strong amplification or suppression
of the magnetic field strength around the event horizon (depending on the sign
of the coupling parameter), can affect the scattering angle and minimal
distance for the electrons moving in the gravitational field of the Black Hole
as well as the dependence of these parameters on the asymptotic magnetic field
strength, initial distance and the Black Hole mass. It is further demonstrated
that the non-minimal coupling between gravity and astrophysical magnetic
fields, caused by the vacuum polarization, can cause significant changes of the
parameter space corresponding to bound trajectories around the Black Hole. In
certain cases, the bounded or unbounded character of a trajectory is determined
solely by the presence of non-minimal coupling and its strength. These effects
could in principle be used as observational signatures of the vacuum
polarization effect and also to constrain the value of the coupling parameter.

balance the load amongst resources. Stateful software LBs that run on commodity

current designs have two main limitations: 1) states are stored as digests
which may cause packet inconsistency due to digest collisions; 2) the data
plane needs to update for every new connection, and frequent updates hurt
throughput and packet consistency. In this work, we present a new software
stateful LB called Concury, which is the first solution to solve these

look up large network states with frequent connection arrivals, which is
succinct in memory cost, consistent under network changes, and incurs
infrequent data plane updates. The evaluation results show that the Concury
algorithm provides 4x throughput and consumes less memory compared to other LB

abstraction that models the peer-to-peer communication capabilities implemented

expresses how much sustained throughput can be maintained for a set of
communication demands, and is therefore a fundamental bound on the usefulness
of a network. Because of this importance, wireless network capacity has been
active area of research for the last two decades.
  The three capacity problems that we study differ in the structure of the
communication demands. The first problem is pairwise capacity, where the
demands are (source, destination) pairs. Pairwise capacity is one of the most
classical definitions, as it was analyzed in the seminal paper of Gupta and
Kumar on wireless network capacity. The second problem we study is broadcast
capacity, in which a single source must deliver packets to all other nodes in
the network. Finally, we turn our attention to all-to-all capacity, in which
all nodes must deliver packets to all other nodes. In all three of these
problems we characterize the optimal achievable throughput for any given
network, and design algorithms which asymptotically match this performance. We
also study these problems in networks generated randomly by a process
introduced by Gupta and Kumar, and fully characterize their achievable
throughput.
  Interestingly, the techniques that we develop for all-to-all capacity also
allow us to design a one-shot gossip algorithm that runs within a
polylogarithmic factor of optimal in every graph. This largely resolves an open
question from previous work on the one-shot gossip problem in this model.

electrons which propagate} from the sun along the Parker-spiral-shaped magnetic
field lines. By assuming a Maxwellian electron distribution function in the
near-sun region where the plasma is collisional, we derive the strahl
distribution function at larger heliospheric distances. We consider the two
most important mechanisms that broaden the strahl: Coulomb collisions and
interactions with oblique ambient whistler turbulence (anomalous diffusion). We
propose that the energy regimes where these mechanisms are important are
separated by an approximate threshold, ${\cal E}_c$; for the electron kinetic
energies ${\cal E}<{\cal E}_c$ the strahl width is mostly governed by Coulomb
collisions, while for ${\cal E}>{\cal E}_c$ by interactions with the whistlers.
The Coulomb broadening decreases as the electron energy increases; the
whistler-dominated broadening, on the contrary, increases with energy and it
can lead to efficient isotropization of energetic electrons and to formation of
the electron halo. The threshold energy ${\cal E}_c$ is relatively high in the
regions closer to the sun, and it gradually decreases with the distance,
implying that the anomalous diffusion becomes progressively more important at
large heliospheric distances. At $1$ AU, we estimate the energy threshold to be
about ${\cal E}_c\sim 200\,{\rm eV}$.

Data-recording is serial which renders complex measurement tasks, such as
quasiparticle interference (QPI) mapping, impractical. However, QPI would
provide insight into band-structure details of quantum materials which can be
inaccessible to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Here we use
compressed sensing (CS) to fundamentally speed-up QPI mapping. We reliably
recover the QPI information from a fraction of the usual local density of state
measurements. The requirement of CS is naturally fulfilled for QPI, since CS
relies on sparsity in a vector domain, here given by few nonzero coefficients
in Fourier space. We exemplify CS on a simulated Cu(111) surface using random
sampling of constant and varying probability density. We further simplify the
motion of the STM tip through an open traveling salesman's problem for greater
efficiency. We expect that the implications of our CS approach will be
transformative for the exploration of 2D quantum materials.

here on the challenges posed by foreground emission, CMB lensing, and
instrumental systematics to detect the signal that arises from gravitational
waves sourced by inflation and parameterized by $r$, at the level of $r \sim
10^{-3}$ or lower, as proposed for future observational efforts. We argue that
more accurate and robust analysis and simulation tools are required for these

simulate the joint impact of foregrounds, CMB lensing, and systematics can be
developed to the level necessary to support the design of a space mission at $r

write transactions invariably synchronize with a coordinator before final
commitment. While enforcing serializability, this model has long been
criticized for not satisfying the applications' availability requirements. When
entering the era of Internet of Things (IoT), this problem has become more
severe, as an increasing number of applications call for the capability of
hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP), where aggregation
constraints need to be enforced as part of transactions. Current systems work
around this by creating escrows, allowing occasional overshoots of constraints,
which are handled via compensating application logic.
  The WiSer DBMS targets consistency with availability, by splitting the
database commit into two steps. First, a PROMISE step that corresponds to what
humans are used to as commitment, and runs without talking to a coordinator.
Second, a SERIALIZE step, that fixes transactions' positions in the
serializable order, via a consensus procedure. We achieve this split via a
novel data representation that embeds read-sets into transaction deltas, and
serialization sequence numbers into table rows. WiSer does no sharding (all
nodes can run transactions that modify the entire database), and yet enforces
aggregation constraints. Both readwrite conflicts and aggregation constraint
violations are resolved lazily in the serialized data. WiSer also covers node
joins and departures as database tables, thus simplifying correctness and
failure handling. We present the design of WiSer as well as experiments
suggesting this approach has promise.

the four years of non-outburst data the Kepler photometry of KIC 5608384
exhibits ellipsoidal light variations (`ELV') with a $\sim$12% amplitude and
period of 8.7 hours. Follow-up ground-based spectral observations have yielded
a high-quality radial velocity curve and the associated mass function.
Additionally, H$\alpha$ emission lines were present in the spectra even though
these were taken while the source was presumably in quiescence. These emission
lines are at least partially eclipsed by the companion K star. We utilize the
available constraints of the mass function, the ELV amplitude, Roche-lobe
filling condition, and inferred radius of the K star to derive the system
masses and orbital inclination angle: $M_{\rm wd} \simeq 0.46 \pm 0.02 \,
M_\odot$, $M_{\rm K} \simeq 0.41 \pm 0.03 \, M_\odot$, and $i \gtrsim

WD in a cataclysmic variable. We have also run binary evolution models using
MESA to infer the most likely parameters of the pre-cataclysmic binary. Using
the mass-transfer rates from the model evolution tracks we conclude that
although the rates are close to the critical value for accretion disk
stability, we expect KIC 5608384 to exhibit dwarf nova outbursts. We also
conclude that the accreting white dwarf most likely descended from a hot
subdwarf and, most notably, that this binary is one of the first bona fide

generate implicit formant masks solely from the input text, which enables a
more accurate phonetic control of singing voice. In addition, we show that two

policies) future carbon emissions are important for sound climate risk
assessments. Deep uncertainty surrounds many drivers of projected emissions.
Here we use a simple integrated assessment model, calibrated to century-scale
data and expert assessments of baseline emissions, global economic growth, and
population growth, to make probabilistic projections of carbon emissions
through 2100. Under a variety of assumptions about fossil fuel resource levels
and decarbonization rates, our projections largely agree with several emissions
projections under current policy conditions. Our global sensitivity analysis
identifies several key economic drivers of uncertainty in future emissions and
shows important higher-level interactions between economic and technological
parameters, while population uncertainties are less important. Our analysis
also projects relatively low global economic growth rates over the remainder of
the century. This illustrates the importance of additional research into
economic growth dynamics for climate risk assessment, especially if pledged and
future climate mitigation policies are weakened or have delayed
implementations. These results showcase the power of using a simple,
transparent, and calibrated model. While the simple model structure has several
advantages, it also creates caveats for our results which are related to
important areas for further research.

Applying a mechanical model and magnitude constraint conditions, we show that

without presetting any reasoning patterns. As a preliminary exploration, we
design six LiLi data sets (Bitwise And, Bitwise Or, Bitwise Xor, Addition,

various transport processes, usually invoking neoclassical physics. A simpler
approach based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), focusing on the effects rather
than the causes of asymmetries, yields useful insights into the generation of
shear flows and radial electric field. The crucial point to recognize is that
an MHD equilibrium in which the plasma pressure is not a flux function can be
maintained only by contributions from mass flows. Coupling between the
asymmetry-generated forces and toroidal geometry results in a strongly up-down
asymmetric effect, where the flows exhibit a strong dependence on the location
of the asymmetry with respect to the midplane. This location-dependence can be
used as an effective control mechanism for the edge and thus the global
confinement in tokamaks. It can also explain a number of poorly-understood
observations. For instance, strong dependence of the low to high (L-H)
confinement transition power threshold $P_{LH}$ on the magnetic topology can be
qualitatively explained within this framework. Similarly, upper-lower midplane
dependence of the poloidal flow direction after massive gas injections (MGI)
naturally follows from this discussion. Similar arguments suggest that the ITER
fueling ports above the midplane, to the extent they can generate a positive
pressure asymmetry at the edge, are misplaced and may lead to higher input
power requirements.

large number of pores, and triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs) are one of
conventional tools for designing porous scaffolds. However, discontinuity,
incompleteness, and high storage space requirements are the three main
shortcomings of TPMSs for porous scaffold design. In this study, we developed
an effective method for heterogeneous porous scaffold generation to overcome
the abovementioned shortcomings of TPMSs. The input of the proposed method is a
trivariate B-spline solid (TBSS) with a cubic parameter domain. The proposed
method first constructs a threshold distribution field (TDF) in the cubic
parameter domain, and then produces a continuous and complete TPMS within it.
Moreover, by mapping the TPMS in the parametric domain to the TBSS, a
continuous and complete porous scaffold is generated in the TBSS. In addition,
if the TBSS does not satisfy engineering requirements, the TDF can be locally
modified in the parameter domain, and the porous scaffold in the TBSS can be
rebuilt. We also defined a new storage space-saving file format based on the
TDF to store porous scaffolds. The experimental results presented in this paper
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method using a TBSS as well

transversely-polarized parton in an unpolarized kaon. The Wigner distributions
are analysed in the transverse impact-parameter plane, the transverse momentum
plane and the mixed plane. Further, to get a complete picture of kaon in terms
of its valence quarks, the variation of longitudinal momentum fraction carried
by quark and antiquark in the generalized transverse momentum-dependent parton
distributions (GTMDs) is studied for different values of transverse quark and
antiquark momentum $({\bf k}_\perp)$ as well as for different values of
momentum transferred to the kaon in transverse direction $({\bf
\Delta}_\perp)$. This has been done for zero as well as non-zero skewedness
representing respectively the absence and presence of momentum transfer to the
final state of kaon in longitudinal direction. Furthermore, the possible
spin-orbit correlation for $u$ and $\bar{s}$ in kaon is elaborated in context
of Wigner distributions and GTMDs.

non-rigid distortions. The physics of water flow suggests that water surfaces
possess spatio-temporal smoothness and temporal periodicity. Hence they possess
a sparse representation in the 3D discrete Fourier (DFT) basis. Motivated by
this, we pose the task of restoration of such video sequences as a compressed
sensing (CS) problem. We begin by tracking a few salient feature points across
the frames of a video sequence of the submerged scene. Using these point
trajectories, we show that the motion fields at all other (non-tracked) points
can be effectively estimated using a typical CS solver. This by itself is a
novel contribution in the field of non-rigid motion estimation. We show that
this method outperforms state of the art algorithms for underwater image
restoration. We further consider a simple optical flow algorithm based on local
polynomial expansion of the image frames (PEOF). Surprisingly, we demonstrate
that PEOF is more efficient and often outperforms all the state of the art
methods in terms of numerical measures. Finally, we demonstrate that a
two-stage approach consisting of the CS step followed by PEOF much more
accurately preserves the image structure and improves the (visual as well as
numerical) video quality as compared to just the PEOF stage.

e.g., GFR, the design of JPEG steganographic distortion cost function turns to
maintain not only the statistical undetectability in DCT domain but also in
spatial domain. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a novel paradigm for
the design of JPEG steganographic distortion cost function, which calculates
the distortion cost via a generalized Distortion Cost Domain Transformation
(DCDT) function. The proposed function comprises the decompressed pixel block
embedding changes and their corresponding embedding distortion costs for unit
change, where the pixel embedding distortion costs are represented in a more
general exponential model, aiming to flexibly allocate the embedding data. In
this way, the JPEG steganography could be formulated as the optimization
problem of minimizing the overall distortion cost in its decompressed spatial
domain, which is equivalent to maximizing its statistical undetectability
against JPEG phase-aware steganalysis features. Experimental results show that
the proposed DCDT equipped with HiLL (a spatial steganographic distortion cost
function) is superior to other state-of-the-art JPEG steganographic schemes,
e.g., UERD, J-UNIWARD, and GUED in resisting the detection of JPEG phase-aware
feature-based steganalyzers GFR and SCA-GFR, and rivals BET-HiLL with one order
of magnitude lower computational complexity, along with the possibility of
being further improved by considering the mutually dependent embedding
interactions. In addition, the proposed DCDT is also verified to be effective
for different image databases and quality factors.

  Classification with Multi-Kernel Metric Learning","15 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The importance of wild video based image set recognition is becoming
monotonically increasing. However, the contents of these collected videos are
often complicated, and how to efficiently perform set modeling and feature
extraction is a big challenge for set-based classification algorithms. In
recent years, some proposed image set classification methods have made a
considerable advance by modeling the original image set with covariance matrix,
linear subspace, or Gaussian distribution. As a matter of fact, most of them
just adopt a single geometric model to describe each given image set, which may
lose some other useful information for classification. To tackle this problem,
we propose a novel algorithm to model each image set from a multi-geometric
perspective. Specifically, the covariance matrix, linear subspace, and Gaussian
distribution are applied for set representation simultaneously. In order to
fuse these multiple heterogeneous Riemannian manifoldvalued features, the
well-equipped Riemannian kernel functions are first utilized to map them into
high dimensional Hilbert spaces. Then, a multi-kernel metric learning framework
is devised to embed the learned hybrid kernels into a lower dimensional common
subspace for classification. We conduct experiments on four widely used
datasets corresponding to four different classification tasks: video-based face
recognition, set-based object categorization, video-based emotion recognition,
and dynamic scene classification, to evaluate the classification performance of
the proposed algorithm. Extensive experimental results justify its superiority
over the state-of-the-art.

scattering due to the presence of two staggered but parallel crack tips. The
discrete scattering problem is reduced to the study of a pair of Wiener-Hopf
equation on an annulus in complex plane, using Fourier transforms. Due to the
offset between the crack edges, the Wiener-Hopf kernel, a 2x2 matrix, is not
amenable to factorization in a desirable form and an asymptotic method is

is to handle batches of updates and queries where the data for each batch fits
onto one machine in constant rounds of parallel computation, as well as to
reduce the total communication between the machines. This objective corresponds
to the gradual buildup of databases over time, while the goal of obtaining
constant rounds of communication for problems in the static setting has been
elusive for problems as simple as undirected graph connectivity.
  We give an algorithm for dynamic graph connectivity in this setting with
constant communication rounds and communication cost almost linear in terms of
the batch size. Our techniques combine a new graph contraction technique, an
independent random sample extractor from correlated samples, as well as
distributed data structures supporting parallel updates and queries in batches.

showing that the batched version of the adaptive connectivity problem is
$\mathsf{P}$-complete in the centralized setting, but sub-linear sized batches
can be handled in a constant number of rounds. Due to the wide applicability of

  Attending and Part Sequencing","PRCV 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Fine-grained image recognition has been a hot research topic in computer
vision due to its various applications. The-state-of-the-art is the
part/region-based approaches that first localize discriminative parts/regions,
and then learn their fine-grained features. However, these approaches have some
inherent drawbacks: 1) the discriminative feature representation of an object
is prone to be disturbed by complicated background; 2) it is unreasonable and
inflexible to fix the number of salient parts, because the intended parts may
be unavailable under certain circumstances due to occlusion or incompleteness,
and 3) the spatial correlation among different salient parts has not been
thoroughly exploited (if not completely neglected). To overcome these
drawbacks, in this paper we propose a new, simple yet robust method by building
part sequence model on the attended object region. Concretely, we first try to
alleviate the background effect by using a region attention mechanism to
generate the attended region from the original image. Then, instead of
localizing different salient parts and extracting their features separately, we
learn the part representation implicitly by applying a mapping function on the
serialized features of the object. Finally, we combine the region attending
network and the part sequence learning network into a unified framework that
can be trained end-to-end with only image-level labels. Our extensive
experiments on three fine-grained benchmarks show that the proposed method
achieves the state of the art performance.

gaseous H$_2$ on grain surfaces which have a variety of binding sites with a
different potential energy depth, thermal hopping, desorption, and the nuclear
spin conversion of adsorbed H$_2$. It is found that the spin conversion
efficiency depends on the H$_2$ gas density and the surface temperature. As a
general trend, enhanced H$_2$ gas density reduces the efficiency, while the
temperature dependence is not monotonic; there is a critical surface
temperature at which the efficiency is the maximum. At low temperatures, the
exchange of gaseous and icy H$_2$ is inefficient (i.e., adsorbed H$_2$ does not
desorb and hinders another gaseous H$_2$ to be adsorbed), while at warm
temperatures, the residence time of H$_2$ on surfaces is too short for the spin
conversion. Additionally, the spin conversion becomes more efficient with
lowering the activation barriers for thermal hopping. We discuss whether the
spin conversion on surfaces can dominate over that in the gas-phase in star-

implement the H$_2$ spin conversion on grain surfaces in existing astrochemical

be the Generalized Graph Fourier Transform in terms of spatio-temporal

an Unified theory was proposed which within the MCT framework incorporated the
activated dynamics via the random first order transition theory (RFOT). Here we
show that the theory although successful in describing other properties of
supercooled liquids is unable to capture the Stokes-Einstein breakdown. We then
show using continuous time random work (CTRW) formalism that the Unified theory
is equivalent to a CTRW dynamics in presence of two waiting time distributions.
It is known from earlier work on CTRW that in such cases the total dynamics is
dominated by the fast motion. This explains the failure of the Unified theory
in predicting the SE breakdown as both the structural relaxation and the
diffusion process are described by the comparatively fast MCT like dynamics.
The study also predicts that other forms of extended MCT will face a similar
issue. We next modify the Unified theory by applying the concept of renewal
theory, usually used in CTRW models where the distribution has a long tail.
According to this theory the first jump given by the persistent time is slower
than the subsequent jumps given by the exchange time. We first show that for
systems with two waiting time distributions even when both the distributions
are exponential the persistent time is larger than the exchange time. We also
identify the persistent time with the slower activated process. The extended
Unified theory can now explain the SE breakdown. In this extended theory at low
temperatures the structural relaxation is described by the activated dynamics
whereas the diffusion is primarily determined by the MCT like dynamics leading
to a decoupling between them. We also calculate a dynamic lengthscale from the
wavenumber dependence of the relaxation time. We find that this dynamic length
scale grows faster than the static length scale.

convolutional auto-encoders and a self-representation matrix is learned in the
latent space using a fully connected layer. Dnet learns view-specific
self-representation matrices while Unet learns a common self-representation
matrix for all views. To exploit the complementarity of multi-view
representations, Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) is introduced as
a diversity regularization, which can capture the non-linear and high-order
inter-view relations. As different views share the same label space, the
self-representation matrices of each view are aligned to the common one by a
universality regularization. Experiments on both multi-feature and

a novel approach that combines functional and power analysis to recover finite
state machines from their synchronous sequential circuit implementations. The
proposed technique formulates the machine exploration and state identification
problem as a Boolean constraint satisfaction problem and solves it using a SMT
(Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver. It uses power measurements to achieve
fast convergence. Experimental results using the LGSynth'91 benchmark suite
show that the satisfiability-based approach is several times faster compared to
existing techniques and can successfully recover 90%-100% of the transitions of
a target machine.

  Using a Centralized Labeled-Multi-Bernoulli Filter",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Urban intersections put high demands on fully automated vehicles, in
particular, if occlusion occurs. In order to resolve such and support vehicles
in unclear situations, a popular approach is the utilization of additional
information from infrastructure-based sensing systems. However, a widespread
use of such systems is circumvented by their complexity and thus, high costs.
Within this paper, a generic interface is proposed, which enables a huge
variety of sensors to be connected. The sensors are only required to measure
very few features of the objects, if multiple distributed sensors with
different viewing directions are available. Furthermore, a Labeled
Multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter is presented, which can not only handle such
measurements, but also infers missing object information about the objects'
extents. The approach is evaluated on simulations and demonstrated on a
real-world infrastructure setup.

  Graphs of Paths on a Grid",,,"10.7155/jgaa.00606",,"math.CO cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a representation of a graph $G$ as an edge intersection graph of paths on
a grid (EPG) every vertex of $G$ is represented by a path on a grid and two
paths share a grid edge iff the corresponding vertices are adjacent. In a
monotonic EPG representation every path on the grid is ascending in both rows
and columns. In a (monotonic) $B_k$-EPG representation every path on the grid
has at most $k$ bends. The (monotonic) bend number $b(G)$ ($b^m(G)$) of a graph
$G$ is the smallest natural number $k$ for which there exists a (monotonic)
$B_k$-EPG representation of $G$.
  In this paper we deal with the monotonic bend number of outerplanar graphs
and show that $b^m(G)\leqslant 2$ holds for every outerplanar graph $G$.
Moreover, we characterize the maximal outerplanar graphs and the cacti with
(monotonic) bend number equal to $0$, $1$ and $2$ in terms of forbidden induced
subgraphs. As a byproduct we obtain low-degree polynomial time algorithms to
construct (monotonic) EPG representations with the smallest possible number of
bends for maximal outerplanar graphs and cacti.

suggests that $^3$He atoms are mobile at an areal density regime higher than
that of the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ phase, where $^4$He films are believed to
be solid. At higher areal densities, the measured heat capacity is proportional
to $T^2$ and depends on the amounts of $^3$He atoms. These behaviors are
anomalous to that of a two-dimensional Fermi fluid, and cannot be explained by
uniform melting of $^4$He films. One possible explanation for these anomalous
behaviors is that helium atoms exhibit fluidity only inside the domain walls of
the adsorption structure, and the dissolved $^3$He atoms gather into them and
behave as a one-dimensional Fermi fluid or as Dirac fermions, depending on the
structure of the domain walls. The behaviors of the measured heat capacity

introduced new models for computation. The idea of Fuzzy algorithms defined by
Zadeh and Lee was followed by introducing Fuzzy Turing Machine (FTM) to create
a platform for a new fuzzy computation model. Then, in his investigations on
its computational power, Wiedermann showed that FTM is able to solve
undecidable problems. His suggested FTM structure, which highly resembles the
original definition was one of the most well-known classical definitions of FTM
lately.To improve some of its weaknesses and vague points which will be
discussed extensively in this paper, we will develop a more complete definition
for fuzzy Turing machines. Our proposed definition of FTM, which encompasses
the conventional definition, is motivated from the definition of General Fuzzy
Automata (GFA) introduced by Doostfatemeh and Kremer. As it improved the
conventional definition of fuzzy automata, especially the problem of membership
assignment and multi-membership resolution, we also improved the same aspects
of FTM through the definition of Comprehensive Fuzzy Turing Machine (CFTM). In
addition, we address on some possible vaguenesses in FTM was not the subject of
focus in fuzzy automata. As example, we investigate the issue of multi-path and
multi-direction which are possible in case of nondeterminism. Finally, we show
the simplicity, applicability and computational efficiency of the CFTM through
an explanatory example.

an analytic model coupled to the merger tree extracted from an N-body
simulation. The analytic model has been set to match the evolution of the
global stellar mass function since redshift $z\sim 2.3$ and give reasonable
predictions of the star formation history of galaxies at the same time. We find
that stellar mass and environment play different roles: the star formation
rate/specific star formation rate-$M_*$ relations are independent of the
environment (defined as the halo mass) at any redshift probed, $0<z<1.5$, for
both star forming and quiescent galaxies, while the star formation
rate-$M_{halo}$ relation strongly depends on stellar mass in the same redshift
range, for both star forming and quiescent galaxies. Moreover, the star
formation rate and the specific star formation rate are strongly dependent on
stellar mass even when the distance from the cluster core is used as a proxy
for the environment, rather than the halo mass. We then conclude that stellar
mass is the main driver of galaxy quenching at any redshift probed in this
study, not just at $z>1$ as generally claimed, while the environment has a
minimal role. All the physical processes linked to the environment must act on
very short timescales, such that they do not influence the star formation of
active galaxies, but increase the probability of a given galaxy to become
quiescent.

long-term memory. The memoryless case reveals a characteristic time where node
activity behaves differently below and above it. We also observe that dense
temporal networks (high number of events) show a clearer characteristic time
than sparse ones. Interestingly, we also find that memory leads to decay of the
node activity; thus, the chances of a node to receive new connections reduce
with the node's age. Finally, we discuss the statistical properties of the

as a test case, we benchmarked our novel approach against standard Bayesian
inference, both with synthetic and real-world data (KITTI dataset). Results
indicate that not only our approach improves running time by at least a factor
of two while providing the same estimation accuracy, but it also alleviates the
computational burden of state dimensionality and loop closures.

application of a calibration procedure for each classifier in the ensemble.
This calibration mitigates the problem of model selection when combining the
classifiers. Lastly, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on
the CUB, AWA1 and AWA2 benchmark data sets and provides competitive performance

applications. However, the rich multipath and high penetration loss of indoor
wireless signal propagation make this task arduous. Though recently studied
fingerprint-based techniques can handle the multipath effects, the sensitivity
of the localization performance to channel fluctuation is a drawback. To
address the latter challenge, we adopt an artificial multi-layer neural network
(MNN) to learn the complex channel impulse responses (CIRs) as fingerprint
measurements. However, the performance of the location classification using MNN
critically depends on the correlation among the training data. Therefore, we
design two different decorrelation filters that preprocess the training data
for discriminative learning. The first one is a linear whitening filter
combined with the principal component analysis (PCA), which forces the
covariance matrix of different feature dimensions to be identity. The other
filter is a nonlinear quantizer that is optimized to minimize the distortion
incurred by the quantization. Numerical results using indoor channel models
illustrate the significant improvement of the proposed decorrelation MNN (DMNN)
compared to other benchmarks.

  Graph-Theoretical Approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the finite-horizon optimal control (FHOC) problem of
Boolean control networks (BCNs) from a graph theory perspective. We first
formulate two general problems to unify various special cases studied in the
literature: (i) the horizon length is $\textit{a priori}$ fixed; (ii) the
horizon length is unspecified but finite for given destination states. Notably,
both problems can incorporate time-variant costs, which are rarely considered
in existing work, and a variety of constraints. The existence of an optimal
control sequence is analyzed under mild assumptions. Motivated by BCNs' finite
state space and control space, we approach the two general problems in an
intuitive and efficient way under a graph-theoretical framework. A weighted
state transition graph and its time-expanded variants are developed, and the
equivalence between the FHOC problem and the shortest path problem in specific
graphs is established rigorously. Two custom algorithms are developed to find
the shortest path and construct the optimal control sequence with lower time
complexity, though technically a classical shortest-path algorithm in graph
theory is sufficient for all problems. Compared with existing algebraic
methods, our graph-theoretical approach can achieve state-of-the-art time
efficiency while targeting the most general problems. Furthermore, our approach
is the first one capable of solving Problem (ii) with time-variant costs.
Finally, the Ara operon genetic network in $\textit{E. coli}$ is used as a
benchmark example to validate the effectiveness of our approach, and the
results of two tasks show that our approach can dramatically reduce the running
time.

However, solving it exactly, i.e., finding the globally optimal solution, is
intractable. A* tree search, which has been shown to be fixed-parameter
tractable, is one of the most efficient exact methods, though it is still
limited to small inputs. We make two key contributions towards improving A*
tree search. First, we show that the consensus maximization tree structure used
previously actually contains paths that connect nodes at both adjacent and
non-adjacent levels. Crucially, paths connecting non-adjacent levels are
redundant for tree search, but they were not avoided previously. We propose a
new acceleration strategy that avoids such redundant paths. In the second
contribution, we show that the existing branch pruning technique also
deteriorates quickly with the problem dimension. We then propose a new branch
pruning technique that is less dimension-sensitive to address this issue.
Experiments show that both new techniques can significantly accelerate A* tree
search, making it reasonably efficient on inputs that were previously out of
reach.

paper introduces filters that are full-stack and can be used to generate many

filters with the help of different binary masks. Orthogonal constraints are
applied over binary masks to decrease their correlation and promote the

maintaining a few full-stack filters and a set of binary masks. We also conduct

Lauga &
Cossu (Phys. Fluids 17, 088106 (2005)) and Min & Kim (Phys. Fluids 17, 108106

channel flow and concluded that the velocity slip greatly suppresses linear
instability and only modestly affects the non-normality. Here we study the
stability of channel flow with streamwise and spanwise slip separately as two
limiting cases of anisotropic slip and explore a broader range of slip length
than previous studies did. We find that, with sufficiently large slip, both
streamwise and spanwise slip trigger three-dimensional leading instabilities.
Overall, the critical Reynolds number is only slightly increased by streamwise
slip, whereas it can be greatly decreased by spanwise slip. Streamwise slip
suppresses the non-modal transient growth, whereas spanwise slip enlarges the
non-modal growth although it does not affect the base flow. Interestingly, as
the spanwise slip length increases, the optimal perturbations exhibit flow
structures different from the well-known streamwise rolls. However, in the
presence of equal slip in both directions, the three-dimensional leading
instabilities disappear and the flow is greatly stabilized. The results suggest
that earlier instability and larger transient growth can be triggered by
introducing anisotropy in the velocity slip.

always selected based on a criteria of the projection's sensitivity to changes.
  Our focus is on online/sequential change detection, where the aim is to
detect changes as quickly as possible, while controlling false alarms at a

monitoring procedure displays high efficiency in detecting even very sparse
changes in the mean, variance and correlation. We demonstrate on real data that

photometric data for Galactic clusters close to the Sun. Lucky imaging has been
an operational technique to measure the positions of visual binary systems for
a decade and a half, enough to apply its results to the calculation of orbits
of some massive multiple systems within ~1 kpc of the Sun. AIMS: We are
measuring distances to Galactic stellar groups containing O stars and I start

to derive new astrometric orbits for the Aa,Ab components for the main ionizing
sources for both clusters: HD 193 322 and 15 Mon, respectively. METHODS: First,
I present a method that uses Gaia DR2 photometry, positions, proper motions,
and parallaxes to obtain the membership and distance of a stellar group and
apply it to Collinder 419 and NGC 2264. Second, I present a new code that
calculates astrometric orbits by searching the whole 7-parameter orbit space

data from the Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) and the AstraLux

obtain Gaia DR2 distances of 1006+37-34 pc for Collinder 419 and 719+-16 pc for
NGC 2264, with the main contribution to the uncertainties coming from the
spatial covariance of the parallaxes. The two NGC 2264 subclusters are at the
same distance (within the uncertainties) and they show a significant relative
proper motion. The distances are shown to be robust. HD 193 322 Aa,Ab follows
an eccentric (e = 0.58+0.03-0.04) orbit with a period of 44+-1 a and the three
stars it contains have a total mass of 76.1+9.9-7.4 M_Sol. The orbit of 15 Mon
Aa,Ab is even more eccentric (e = 0.770+0.023-0.030), with a period of 108+-12
a and a total mass of 45.1+3.6-3.3 M_Sol for its two stars.

measurement pointer. By incorporating with the weak-value amplification
technique, the optical conductivity of monolayer graphene taken as a universal
constant of $(0.993\pm0.005)\sigma_0$ is detected, and a high measuring
resolution with $1.5\times10^{-8}\Omega^{-1}$ is obtained. For few-layer

transfer (PGST), which is of interest for high-fidelity transfer of information
in quantum computing. Realizations of PGST networks have so far mostly relied
either on very special network geometries or imposed conditions such as
transcendental on-site potentials. However, it was recently shown [Eisenberg et
al., arXiv:1804.01645] that PGST generally arises when a network's eigenvectors
and the factors $P_{\pm}$ of its characteristic polynomial $P$ fulfill certain
conditions, where $P_{\pm}$ correspond to eigenvectors which have $\pm 1$
parity on the input and target sites. We combine this result with the so-called
isospectral reduction of a network to obtain $P_{\pm}$ from a dimensionally
reduced form of the Hamiltonian. Equipped with the knowledge of the factors
$P_{\pm}$, we show how a variety of setups can be equipped with PGST by proper
tuning of $P_{\pm}$. Having demonstrated a method of designing networks
featuring pretty good state transfer of single site excitations, we further
show how the obtained networks can be manipulated such that they allow for
robust storage of qubits. We hereby rely on the concept of compact localized
states, which are eigenstates of a Hamiltonian localized on a small subdomain,
and whose amplitudes completely vanish outside of this domain. Such states are
natural candidates for the storage of quantum information, and we show how
certain Hamiltonians featuring pretty good state transfer of single site
excitation can be equipped with compact localized states such that their
transfer is made possible.

frequency bands and schedules packet transmissions for all vehicle user

as a discrete-time single-agent Markov decision process (MDP). The technical
challenges in solving the optimal control policy originate from high spatial
mobility and temporally varying traffic information arrivals of the VUE-pairs.
To make the problem solving tractable, we first decompose the original MDP into
a series of per-VUE-pair MDPs. Then we propose a proactive algorithm based on
long short-term memory and deep reinforcement learning techniques to address
the partial observability and the curse of high dimensionality in local network

Linking microstructure and material properties is essential for predicting
material response to driving forces, managing in-service material degradation,
and engineering materials for optimal performance. Elastic, thermal, and
acoustic properties provide a convenient gateway to directly or indirectly
probe material structure across multiple length scales. We review how using the
laser-induced transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) technique, which uses a
transient diffraction grating to generate surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and
temperature gratings on a material surface, non-destructively reveals the
material elasticity, thermal diffusivity, and energy dissipation on the
sub-microsecond timescale, within a tunable sub-surface depth. This technique
has already been applied to many challenging problems in materials
characterization, from analysis of radiation damage, to colloidal crystals, to
phonon-mediated thermal transport in nanostructured systems, to crystal
orientation and lattice parameter determination. Examples of these
applications, as well as inferring aspects of microstructural evolution,
illustrate the wide potential reach of TGS to solve old materials challenges,
and to uncover new science. We conclude by looking ahead at the tremendous
potential of TGS for materials discovery and optimization when applied in situ
to dynamically evolving systems.

on the accuracy of the estimated multi-coil sensitivity, the proposed method
can perform parallel reconstruction from undersampled data without explicit

supporting the superstructure. Conversely the metabarrier surrounds and shields
the structure from incoming waves. The two solutions are based on a cell layout
of local resonators whose dynamic properties are tuned using finite element

have a significant impact on the measured $v_{\rm rad}$. We detail the steps to

impact of Cepheid spectral properties and $v_{\rm rad}$ computation method on
the resulting line profiles. We collected more than 3900 high-resolution
spectra from seven different spectrographs of 64 classical Cepheids. These
spectra were standardised through a single process on pre-defined wavelength
ranges. We built six correlation templates selecting un-blended lines of
different depths from a synthetic Cepheid spectrum, on three different
wavelength ranges from 390 to 800 nm. Each spectrum was cross-correlated with
these templates to build the corresponding CCFs. We derived a set of line
profile observables as well as three different $v_{\rm rad}$ measurements from
each CCF. This study confirms that both the template wavelength range, its mean
line depth and width, and the $v_{\rm rad}$ computation method significantly
impact the $v_{\rm rad}$. Deriving more robust Cepheid $v_{\rm rad}$ time
series require to minimise the asymmetry of the line profile and its impact on
the $v_{\rm rad}$. Centroid $v_{\rm rad}$, that exhibit slightly smaller
amplitudes but significantly smaller scatter than Gaussian or biGaussian
$v_{\rm rad}$, should thus be favoured. Stronger lines are also less asymmetric
and lead to more robust $v_{\rm rad}$ than weaker lines.

statistician or practitioner, with careful thought about what each parameter
represents. This results in particularly interpretable models which can be used
to explain relationships present in the observed data. Bayesian models are
useful when an experiment has only a small number of observations and in
applications where transparency of data driven decisions is important.
Traditionally, parameter inference in Bayesian statistics has involved
constructing bespoke MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) schemes for each newly
proposed statistical model. This results in plausible models not being
considered since efficient inference schemes are challenging to develop or
implement. Probabilistic programming aims to reduce the barrier to performing
Bayesian inference by developing a domain specific language (DSL) for model
specification which is decoupled from the parameter inference algorithms. This
paper introduces functional programming principles which can be used to develop
an embedded probabilistic programming language. Model inference can be carried
out using any generic inference algorithm. In this paper Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) is used, an efficient MCMC method requiring the gradient of the
un-normalised log-posterior, calculated using automatic differentiation. The

moving from the metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-3.0/-2.5) to the metal-rich

distribution as a function of the metallicity strongly indicates that the
long-standing problem of the Oosterhoff dichotomy among Galactic globulars is
the consequence of the lack of metal-intermediate clusters hosting RRLs. We
also found that the luminosity amplitude, in contrast with period, does not
show a solid correlation with metallicity. This suggests that
period-amplitude-metallicity relations should be cautiously treated.

equations is a standard tool in many engineering workflows today. However, the
simulation of complex geometries is computationally expensive. Many engineering
workflows require multiple simulations with small, non parametric changes in
between. The use of localized model order reduction for subsequent simulations
of geometries with localized changes is very promising. It produces lots of
computational tasks with little dependencies and thus parallelizes well.
Furthermore, the possibility to reuse intermediary results in the subsequent
simulations can lead to large computational savings. In this thesis, we
investigate different aspects of localized model order reduction and propose
various improvements. A simulation methodology named ArbiLoMod, comprising a
localized training, a localized a posteriori error estimator and an enrichment
procedure is proposed. A new localized a posteriori error estimator with
computable constants is presented and analyzed. A new training algorithm which
is based on a transfer operator is derived. It can be shown to converge nearly
as fast as the singular value decay of this operator. The transfer operator's
spectrum is observed to decay fast in electromagnetic simulations in printed
circuit boards. New online enrichment algorithms are proposed. All results are
supported by numerical experiments, for which the source code for reproduction
is provided.

other models. Because of continuous rejuvenation, the SMS acts as a

manipulator where the robot end effector position follows a task space
trajectory. The joints are actuated with the desired velocity profile to
achieve this task. This problem has been solved using a single network adaptive
critic (SNAC) by expressing the forward kinematics as input affine system.
Usually in SNAC, the critic weights are updated using back propagation
algorithm while little attention is given to convergence to the optimal cost.
In this paper, we propose a critic weight update law that ensures convergence
to the desired optimal cost while guaranteeing the stability of the closed loop
kinematic control. In kinematic control, the robot is required to reach a
specific target position. This has been solved as an optimal regulation problem
in the context of SNAC based kinematic control. When the robot is required to
follow a time varying task space trajectory, then the kinematic control has
been framed as an optimal tracking problem. For tracking, an augmented system
consisting of tracking error and reference trajectory is constructed and the
optimal control policy is derived using SNAC framework. The stability and
performance of the system under the proposed novel weight tuning law is
guaranteed using Lyapunov approach. The proposed kinematic control scheme has
been validated in simulations and experimentally executed using a real six
degrees of freedom (DOF) Universal Robot (UR) 10 manipulator.

unachievable on Earth for technical issues such as wind stress that are not

facilitate its building and manoeuvring, compared to Earth-based telescopes. As
a guaranteed by-product, such a large lunar telescope will allow Intensity
Interferometric measurements when coupled with large Earth-based telescopes,

November, 4. The pre-eruptive H alpha filament was modelled by the non-linear
force free field model, which showed that it consisted of two helical systems.
Tether-cutting reconnection involving these two systems led to the formation of
a hot sigmoidal loop structure rooted in a small hook that formed at the end of
the flare ribbon. Subsequently, the hot loops started to slip away form the
small hook until it disappeared. The loops continued slipping and the ribbon
elongated itself by several tens of arc seconds. A new and larger hook then
appeared at the end of elongated ribbon with hot and twisted loops rooted
there. After the eruption of these hot loops, the ribbon hook expanded and
later contracted. We interpret these observations in the framework of the
recent three dimensional (3D) extensions to the standard solar flare model,
which predict the drift of the flux rope footpoints. The hot sigmoidal loop is
interpreted as the flux rope, whose footpoints drift during the eruption. While
the deformation and drift of the new hook can be described by the model, the
displacement of the flux rope footpoint from the filament to that of the
erupting flux rope indicate that the hook evolution can be more complex than
those captured by the model.

the Kerr rotation which should be proportional to the magnetization. In

maps. We find that participants are significantly more accurate with raised
flow paths whose height is proportional to flow distance but fastest with
traditional straight line 2D flows. In our second and third experiment, we
compared flat maps, 3D globes and a novel interactive design we call MapsLink,
involving a pair of linked flat maps. We find that participants took
significantly more time with MapsLink than other flow maps while the 3D globe
with raised flows was the fastest, most accurate, and most preferred method.
Our work suggests that careful use of the third spatial dimension can resolve
visual clutter in complex flow maps.

from the spherical case. Non-spherical particles are hypostatic at their
jamming points, while isostaticity is ensured in the case of the jamming of
spherical particles. This structural difference implies that the presence of
asphericity affects the critical exponents related to the contact number and
the vibrational density of states. Moreover, while the force and gap
distributions of isostatic jamming present power-law behaviors, even an
infinitesimal asphericity is enough to smooth out these singularities. In a
recent work [PNAS 115(46), 11736], we have used a combination of marginal
stability arguments and the replica method to explain these observations. We
argued that systems with internal degrees of freedom, like the rotations in
ellipsoids, or the variation of the radii in the case of the \textit{breathing}
particles fall in the same universality class. In this paper, we review
comprehensively the results about the jamming with internal degrees of freedom

Krylov subspace, whose orthonormal basis is generated by the symmetric Lanczos

There have been some a-priori error bounds for the optimal solution and the
optimal objective value in the literature, but no a-priori result exists on the
convergence of Lagrangian multipliers involved in projected TRS's and the
residual norm of approximate solution. In this paper, a general convergence

a new multi-attention learning model based on adaptive boosting. AttentionBoost
designs a multi-stage network and introduces a new loss adjustment mechanism
for a dense prediction model to adaptively learn what to attend at each stage
directly on image data without necessitating any prior definition about what to

mistakes of previous stages, by adjusting the loss weight of each pixel

applications in different domains. While spectral techniques have been
successfully applied for clustering undirected graphs, the performance of

satisfactory: these algorithms usually require symmetrising the matrix

clustering do not capture cluster-structures in which the information given by
the direction of the edges is crucial. To overcome these downsides, we propose
a spectral clustering algorithm based on a complex-valued matrix representation

for digraphs in which the cluster-structure is given not only by variations in
edge densities, but also by the direction of the edges. The significance of our
work is highlighted on a data set pertaining to internal migration in the
United States: while previous spectral clustering algorithms for digraphs can

when one of them has a kink solution and the second one either a kink or an

parameter $\lambda$ which has to satisfy $| \lambda|< 2$. We then take these
solitonic static solutions (with solitons well localised) and construct from
them systems involving two solitons in each field (kinks and antikinks) and
then use them as initial conditions for their evolution in Lorentz covariant
versions of such models. This way we study their interactions and compare them
with similar interactions involving only one Sine-Gordon field. In particular,
we look at the behaviour of two static kinks in each field (which for one field
repel each other) and of a system involving kinks and anti-kinks (which for one
field attract each other) and look how their behaviour depends on the strength
of the interaction $\lambda$ between the two fields. Our simulations have led
us to look again at the static BPS solutions of systems involving more fields.
We have found that such ostensibly 'static' BPS solutions can exhibit small
motions due to the excitation of their zero modes. These excitations arise from
small unavoidable numerical errors (the overall translation is cancelled by the
conservation of momentum) but as systems of two or more fields have more that
one zero mode such motions can be generated and are extremely small. The energy
of our systems has been conserved to within $10^{-5}\%$.

of a system from observations. Purely model-free statistical methods, such as
Artificial Neural Networks, tend to perform poorly for such tasks. They are
therefore not well suited to many questions from applications, for example in
Bayesian filtering and reliability estimation.
  This work introduces a parametric polynomial kernel method that can be used
for inferring the future behaviour of Ordinary Differential Equation models,
including chaotic dynamical systems, from observations. Using numerical
integration techniques, parametric representations of Ordinary Differential
Equations can be learnt using Backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
The polynomial technique presented here is based on a nonparametric method,
kernel ridge regression. However, the time complexity of nonparametric kernel
ridge regression scales cubically with the number of training data points. Our
parametric polynomial method avoids this manifestation of the curse of
dimensionality, which becomes particularly relevant when working with large
time series data sets.
  Two numerical demonstrations are presented. First, a simple regression test
case is used to illustrate the method and to compare the performance with
standard Artificial Neural Network techniques. Second, a more substantial test
case is the inference of a chaotic spatio-temporal dynamical system, the
Lorenz--Emanuel system, from observations. Our method was able to successfully
track the future behaviour of the system over time periods much larger than the
training data sampling rate. Finally, some limitations of the method are
presented, as well as proposed directions for future work to mitigate these
limitations.

surfaces for both the magnetic field and the velocity field are almost
spherical, which indicates a 3-D isotropic feature. On the other hand, there is
a weak elongation in one of the perpendicular direction in the fast solar wind
fluctuations. The 3-D feature of the self-correlation level contours surfaces
cannot be explained by the existed theory.

alternative vision of how instant messaging and email services could have
evolved, offering security, extensibility, and openness in a distributed
environment instead of the hardened walled gardens that today's rich messaging

cases: secure channel instant messaging, business workflows with routed forms,

security and performance, we designed WSEmail with security in mind and
formally proved the security of one of its core protocols (on-demand
attachments) using the TulaFale and ProVerif automated proof tools. We provide
performance measurements for WSEmail functions in a prototype we implemented
using .NET. Our experiments show a latency of about a quarter of a second per

Internet and call for secure and efficient secret sharing (SS) scheme to meet
their requirements. A $(t,n)$ threshold SS scheme divides a secret into $n$
shares such that any $t$ or more than $t$ shares can recover the secret while
less than $t$ shares cannot. However, an adversary, even without a valid share,
may obtain the secret by impersonating a shareholder to recover the secret with
$t$ or more legal shareholders. Therefore, this paper uses linear code to
propose a threshold changeable secret sharing (TCSS) scheme, in which threshold
should increase from $t$ to the exact number of all participants during secret
reconstruction. The scheme does not depend on any computational assumption and
realizes asymptotically perfect security. Furthermore, based on the proposed
TCSS scheme, a group authentication scheme is constructed, which allows a group
user to authenticate whether all users are legal group members at once and thus
provides efficient and flexible m-to-m authentication for group oriented
applications.

convolution and introduce a skip connection between input and output. The
proposed network is trained with a novel loss function, which combines Chamfer

conduct a series of experiments to evaluate our method and validate the

labeled images; (2) generate new training samples using this detector's
prediction as pseudo labels of unlabeled images; (3) retrain the detector on
the labeled samples and partial pseudo labeled samples. In this way, the
detector can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data to become robust. In
this paper, we propose an interaction mechanism between a teacher and two
students to generate more reliable pseudo labels for unlabeled data, which are
beneficial to semi-supervised facial landmark detection. Specifically, the two
students are instantiated as dual detectors. The teacher learns to judge the
quality of the pseudo labels generated by the students and filter out
unqualified samples before the retraining stage. In this way, the student
detectors get feedback from their teacher and are retrained by premium data
generated by itself. Since the two students are trained by different samples, a
combination of their predictions will be more robust as the final prediction
compared to either prediction. Extensive experiments on 300-W and AFLW
benchmarks show that the interactions between teacher and students contribute
to better utilization of the unlabeled data and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

expensive data collections, we propose a semi-supervised adversarial learning
framework that only utilizes a small number of image-depth pairs in conjunction
with a large number of easily-available monocular images to achieve high
performance. In particular, we use one generator to regress the depth and two
discriminators to evaluate the predicted depth , i.e., one inspects the
image-depth pair while the other inspects the depth channel alone. These two
discriminators provide their feedbacks to the generator as the loss to generate
more realistic and accurate depth predictions. Experiments show that the
proposed approach can (1) improve most state-of-the-art models on the NYUD v2

an attribute, or a semantic (geometrical) interaction between two objects.
Accordingly, the semantic (geometrical) context-aware embeddings for each unit
are obtained through the corresponding GCN learning processers. At each time
step, a context gated attention module takes as inputs the embeddings of the
visual semantic units and hierarchically align the current word with these
units by first deciding which type of visual semantic unit (object, attribute,

visual semantic units under this type. Extensive experiments are conducted on

generation of each turbine is transmitted, possibly via other turbines, to a
substation that is connected to the power grid. On every possible
interconnection there can be at most one of various different cable types. Each
type comes with a cost per unit length and with a capacity. Designing a
cost-minimal cable layout for a wind farm to feed all turbine production into
the power grid is called the Wind Farm Cabling Problem (WCP).
  We consider a formulation of WCP as a flow problem on a graph where the cost
of a flow on an edge is modeled by a step function originating from the cable
types. Recently, we presented a proof-of-concept for a negative cycle
canceling-based algorithm for WCP [14]. We extend key steps of that heuristic

problems arising from the special structure of WCP.
  A thorough experimental evaluation identifies the best setup of the algorithm
and compares it to existing methods from the literature such as Mixed-integer
Linear Programming (MILP) and Simulated Annealing (SA). The heuristic runs in a
range of half a millisecond to approximately one and a half minutes on
instances with up to 500 turbines. It provides solutions of similar quality
compared to both competitors with running times of one hour and one day. When
comparing the solution quality after a running time of two seconds, our
algorithm outperforms the MILP- and SA-approaches, which allows it to be

Searcher follows a continuous unit-speed path until the Hider is reached, and
expanding search, in which, at any point in time, the Searcher may restart from
any previously reached point. The former has been the usual paradigm for
studying search games, whereas the latter is a more recent paradigm that can
model real-life settings such as hunting for a fugitive, demining a field, or
search-and-rescue operations. We seek both deterministic and randomized search
strategies that minimize the competitive ratio, namely the worst-case ratio of
the Hider's discovery time, divided by the shortest path to it from the root.
Concerning expanding search, we show that a simple search strategy that applies
a ""waterfilling"" principle has optimal deterministic competitive ratio; in
contrast, we show that the optimal randomized competitive ratio is attained by
fairly complex strategies even in a very simple network of three arcs.
Motivated by this observation, we present and analyze an expanding search
strategy that is a 5/4 approximation of the randomized competitive ratio. Our
approach is also applicable to pathwise search, for which we give a strategy
that is a 5 approximation of the randomized competitive ratio, and which
improves upon strategies derived from previous work.

with no moving parts such as LOFAR is known to vary considerably with
orientation of the source to the receivers. Calibration models exist for this
dependency such as those that are used in the LOFAR pipeline. Presented here is
a system for comparing the predicted outputs from any given model with the
results of an observation. In this paper, a sample observation of a bright
source, Cassiopeia A, is used to demonstrate the software in operation, by
providing an observation and a model of that observation which can be compared
with one another. The package presented here is flexible to allow it to be used
with other models and sources. The system operates by first calculating the
predictions of the model and the results of an observation of linear fluxes and
Stokes parameters separately. The model and observed values are then joined
using the variables common to both, time and frequency. Normalisation and RFI
excision are carried out and the differences between the prediction and the
observation are calculated. A wide selection of 2-, 3- and 4-dimensional plots
are generated to illustrate the dependence of the model and the observation as
well as the difference between them on independent parameters time, frequency,
altitude and azimuth. Thus, beamModelTester provides a framework by which it is
possible to calibrate and propose refinements to models and to compare models
with one another.

great potential for improving supervised models. When the cost of acquiring

select the most informative data points to be labeled. However, for many
large-scale problems standard greedy procedures become computationally
infeasible and suffer from negligible model change. In this paper, we introduce
a novel Bayesian batch active learning approach that mitigates these issues.
Our approach is motivated by approximating the complete data posterior of the
model parameters. While naive batch construction methods result in correlated
queries, our algorithm produces diverse batches that enable efficient active
learning at scale. We derive interpretable closed-form solutions akin to
existing active learning procedures for linear models, and generalize to
arbitrary models using random projections. We demonstrate the benefits of our
approach on several large-scale regression and classification tasks.

expression essentially different from the conventional exponential
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) ansatz. Rather it is represented by the
generalized exponential function (GEF) directly related to what is known in

different from that of the usual exponential ansatz, which invalidated previous

exponential decay of the heat kernel in space, we show the oscillatory behavior
of GEF for higher-derivative operators. We give several integral

progenitors of the optical transients kilonovae (KNe). KNe are powered by the
radioactive decay of neutron-rich elements (r-process elements) which are
believed to be the product of disruption of neutron stars during their merger.
KNe exhibit interesting parallels with type Ia supernovae (SNe), whose light
curves show specific correlations which allow them to be used as standardizable
candles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the KN light curves
exhibiting similar correlations. While a satisfactory answer to this question
can only be provided by future KN observations, employing theoretical models we
explore whether there is any ground for harboring such expectations. Using
semi-analytic models of KN light curves in conjunction with results from
numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers, we obtain the
maximum bolometric luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{Bol}}^{\mathrm{max}}$) and decline
in luminosity ($\Delta L_{\mathrm{Bol}}$) for a simulated population of
mergers. We find that theoretical light curves of KNe show remarkable
correlations despite the complex physics governing their behavior. This
presents a possibility of future observations to uncover such correlations in
the observed light curves, eventually allowing observers to standardize these
light curves and to use them for local distance measurements.

We developed the ensemble200 model which scored 0.66 Cohen Kappa which was
lower than the DenseNet model (Pranav et al, 2018) but the model performance
with the F1 score outperforms the DenseNet model and its Cohen Kappa score
variability with the different studies is lower as the best cohen kappa score

  Classifier Chain","27 pages",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classifier chain (CC) is a multi-label learning approach that constructs a
sequence of binary classifiers according to a label order. Each classifier in
the sequence is responsible for predicting the relevance of one label. When
training the classifier for a label, proceeding labels will be taken as
extended features. If the extended features are highly correlated to the label,
the performance will be improved, otherwise, the performance will not be
influenced or even degraded. How to discover label correlation and determine
the label order is critical for CC approach. This paper employs Bayesian
network (BN) to model the label correlations and proposes a new BN-based CC
method (BNCC). First, conditional entropy is used to describe the dependency
relations among labels. Then, a BN is built up by taking nodes as labels and
weights of edges as their dependency relations. A new scoring function is
proposed to evaluate a BN structure, and a heuristic algorithm is introduced to
optimize the BN. At last, by applying topological sorting on the nodes of the
optimized BN, the label order for constructing CC model is derived.
Experimental comparisons demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the
proposed method.

best of our knowledge, there is no known input-sensitive algorithm for
enumerating minimal dominating sets, or one of their related sets, in bipartite

modeled fracture explicitly beyond Griffith's criterion. Here we use a
multi-physics phase-field approach to model self-consistently anisotropic phase
transformation, elasto-plastic deformation, and crack initiation and

existence of a vulnerable window of yield strength inside which pillars
fracture during lithiation. They identify two different modes of fracture
inside that window with and without surface localization of plastic deformation
prior to fracture for lower and higher yield strength, respectively, and
highlight the importance of taking into account this localization to accurately
predict the onset of fracture within Griffith theory. The results further
demonstrate how the increased robustness of hollow nanopillars can be
understood as a direct effect of anode geometry on the size of this vulnerable
window. Those insights provide an improved theoretical basis for designing
mechanically stable phase-transforming battery materials undergoing large

of local self-sustained high currents, presumably originating from impurities
induced during chamber production. Very effective, though long, recovery

their full functionality and the muon detector efficiency to be kept close to

adding a small percentage of oxygen in the gas mixture has been studied and

role for both intra-protein and protein-water interactions -- the two main
driving forces for the structure and dynamics of proteins in aqueous solution.
Typically, these interactions are only treated phenomenologically via pairwise
potential terms in classical force fields. Here, we use an explicit
quantum-mechanical approach based on density-functional tight-binding with the
many-body dispersion formalism, which allows us to demonstrate the unexpected
relevance of the many-body character of dispersion interactions for protein
energetics and the protein-water interaction. In contrast to commonly employed
pairwise approaches, many-body effects significantly decrease the relative
stability of the native state in the absence of water. In an aqueous
environment, the collective character of the protein-water van der Waals
interaction counteracts this effect and stabilizes native conformations and
transition states. This stabilization arises due to a high degree of
delocalization and collectivity of protein-water dispersion interactions,
suggesting a remarkable persistence of long-range electron correlation through
aqueous environments. Our findings are exemplified on prototypical showcases of
proteins forming $\beta$-sheets, hairpins, and helices, emphasizing the crucial

We adopt a simple phenomenological description of the anisotropy, in which the

explore (i) a simple model that assumes a phenomenological shape for the

injection and radiative losses (we include the effects of the anisotropy on the
synchrotron cooling rate). Considering the BL Lac object Mkn 421 as
representative of the entire class, we show that in both cases the emission can
be satisfactorily reproduced under equipartition between the magnetic field and
the relativistic electrons. This is in better agreement with the idea that jets
are launched as Poynting dominated flows with respect to the standard isotropic
scenario, which requires both a low magnetization and a low radiative
efficiency to reproduce the observed emission. The hard spectrum predicted for
the inverse Compton continuum at TeV energies could be used as a potential test
of the anisotropic model.

strongly-correlated nature of symmetry-protected topological defects by
focusing on situations where such defects arise spontaneously as dynamical
solitons in intertwined topological phases, where symmetry breaking coexists
with topological symmetry protection. In particular, we focus on the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Bose-Hubbard model, a one-dimensional chain of interacting
bosons coupled to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields, and show how solitons with
$\mathbb{Z}_n$ topological charges appear for particle/hole dopings about
certain commensurate fillings, extending the results of [1] beyond half
filling. We show that these defects host fractionalized bosonic
quasi-particles, forming bound states that travel through the system unless
externally pinned, and repel each other giving rise to a fractional soliton
lattice for sufficiently high densities. Moreover, we uncover the topological
origin of these fractional bound excitations through a pumping mechanism, where
the quantization of the inter-soliton transport allows us to establish a
generalized bulk-defect correspondence. This in-depth analysis of dynamical
topological defects bound to fractionalized quasi-particles, together with the
possibility of implementing our model in cold-atomic experiments, paves the way

by locally varying strong electric field to acquire effective electron
temperatures nonuniformly distributing in nanoscales and largely exceeding the
temperature of host crystal lattice. The thermal dynamics of electrons and the
lattice are hence nontrivial and its understanding at nanoscales is decisively
important for gaining higher device performance. Here, we propose and
demonstrate that in layered conductors nonequilibrium nature between the
electrons and the lattice can be explicitly pursued by simulating the
conducting layer by separating it into two physical sheets representing,
respectively, the electron- and the lattice-subsystems. We take, as an example
of simulating GaAs devices, a 35nm thick 1um wide U-shaped conducting channel
with 15nm radius of curvature at the inner corner of the U-shaped bend, and
find a remarkable hot spot to develop due to hot electron generation at the
inner corner. The hot spot in terms of the electron temperature achieves a
significantly higher temperature and is of far sharper spatial distribution
when compared to the hot spot in terms of the lattice temperature. Similar
simulation calculation made on a metal (NiCr) narrow lead of the similar
geometry shows that a hot spot shows up as well at the inner corner, but its
strength and the spatial profiles are largely different from those in
semiconductor devices. The remarkable difference between the semiconductor and
the metal is interpreted to be due to the large difference in the electron
specific heat, rather than the difference in the electron phonon interaction.
This work will provide useful hints to deeper understanding of the
nonequilibrium properties of electrical conductors, through a simple and
convenient method for modeling nonequilibrium layered conductors.

finite-length duct is studied. A divergence-free basis technique is used to
formulate the weak form of the problem. A SUPG (streamingline upwind
Petrov-Galerkin) based scheme for eigenvalue problems is proposed to stabilize
the solution. With proper boundary condtions, the least-stable eigenmodes and
decay rates are computed. It is again found that the flows are asymptotically
stable for all $Re$ up to $2500$. It is discovered that the least-stable
eigenmodes have a boundary-layer-structure at high $Re$, although the
Poiseuille base flow does not exhibits such structure. At these Reynolds
numbers, the eigenmodes are dominant in the vicinity of the duct wall and are
convected downstream. The boundary-layer-structure brings singularity to the
modes at high $Re$ with unbounded perturbation gradient. It is shown that due
to the singular structure of the least-stable eigenmodes, the linear
Navier-Stoker operator tends to have pseudospectrua and the nonlinear mechanism
kicks in when the perturbation energy is still small at high $Re$. The
decreasing stable region as $Re$ increases is a result of both the decreasing
decay rate and the singular structure of the least-stable modes. The result
demonstrated that at very high $Re$, linearization of Navier-Stokes equation
for duct flow may not be a good model problem with physical disturbances.

in this paper present two generative networks for respectively modeling the

optimization solution to blind deconvolution. In particular, we adopt an
asymmetric Autoencoder with skip connections for generating latent clean image,

SoftMax nonlinearity is applied to the output layer of FCN to meet the

be explained as a kind of ""zero-shot"" self-supervised learning of the

methods to detect the new adversarial attacks. However, new attack methods keep
evolving constantly and yield new adversarial examples to bypass the existing

a model of the AO long exposure PSF, adapted to various seeing conditions and
any AO system. This model is made to match accurately both the core of the PSF
and its turbulent halo. Methods. The PSF model we develop is based on a
parsimonious parameterization of the phase power spectral density with only
five parameters to describe circularly symmetric PSFs and seven parameters for
asymmetrical ones. Moreover, one of the parameters is directly the Fried
parameter r0 of the turbulence s strength. This physical parameter is an asset
in the PSF model since it can be correlated with external measurements of the
r0, such as phase slopes from the AO real time computer (RTC) or site seeing
monitoring. Results. We fit our model against endtoend simulated PSFs using
OOMAO tool, and against on sky PSFs from the SPHERE ZIMPOL imager and the MUSE
integral field spectrometer working in AO narrowfield mode. Our model matches
the shape of the AO PSF both in the core and the halo, with a sub 1 percent
relative error for simulated and experimental data. We also show that we
retrieve the r0 parameter with subcentimeter precision on simulated data. For
ZIMPOL data, we show a correlation of 97 percent between our r0 estimation and
the RTC estimation. Finally, MUSE allows us to test the spectral dependency of

solid mineral particles that likely constitute exoplanetary clouds. Here, we
investigate how the porosity of cloud particles evolve in exoplanetary
atmospheres and influence the cloud vertical profiles. We first construct a
porosity evolution model that takes into account the fractal aggregation and
the compression of cloud particle aggregates. Using a cloud microphysical model
coupled with the porosity model, we demonstrate that the particle internal
density can significantly decrease during the cloud formation. As a result,
fluffy-aggregate clouds ascend to altitude much higher than that for
compact-sphere clouds assumed so far. We also examine how the fluffy-aggregate
clouds affect transmission spectra. We find that the clouds largely obscure the
molecular features and produce a spectral slope originated by the scattering
properties of aggregates. Finally, we compare the synthetic spectra with the
observations of GJ1214 b and find that its flat spectrum could be explained if
the atmospheric metallicity is sufficiently high ($\ge100\times$ solar) and the
monomer size is sufficiently small ($r_{\rm mon}<1~{\rm {\mu}m}$). The
high-metallicity atmosphere may offer the clues to explore the gas accretion

we present NEO, a model agnostic framework to detect and mitigate such backdoor

victim into visiting an attack web page, which leverages the cross-origin
interaction features of the victim's web browser to infer the victim's state at
a target web site. Multiple instances of COSI attacks have been found in the
past under different names such as login detection or access detection attacks.
But, those attacks only consider two states (e.g., logged in or not) and focus
on a specific browser leak method (or XS-Leak). This work shows that mounting
more complex COSI attacks such as deanonymizing the owner of an account,
determining if the victim owns sensitive content, and determining the victim's
account type often requires considering more than two states. Furthermore,
robust attacks require supporting a variety of browsers since the victim's
browser cannot be predicted apriori. To address these issues, we present a
novel approach to identify and build complex COSI attacks that differentiate
more than two states and support multiple browsers by combining multiple attack
vectors, possibly using different XS-Leaks. To enable our approach, we
introduce the concept of a COSI attack class. We propose two novel techniques
to generalize existing COSI attack instances into COSI attack classes and to
discover new COSI attack classes. We systematically apply our techniques to
existing attacks, identifying 40 COSI attack classes. As part of this process,
we discover a novel XS-Leak based on window.postMessage. We implement our
approach into Basta-COSI, a tool to find COSI attacks in a target web site. We
apply Basta-COSI to test four stand-alone web applications and 58 popular web

algebraic and algorithmically equivalent. Given two polytops $A\subseteq B$ and
a number $k$, the Nested Polytope Problem (NPP) asks, if there exists a
polytope $X$ on $k$ vertices such that $A\subseteq X \subseteq B$. The polytope
$A$ is given by a set of vertices and the polytope $B$ is given by the defining
hyperplanes. We show a universality theorem for NPP. Given an instance $I$ of
the NPP, we define the solutions set of $I$ as $$ V'(I) = \{(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\in
\mathbb{R}^{k\cdot n} : A\subseteq \text{conv}(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \subseteq B\}.$$
As there are many symmetries, induced by permutations of the vertices, we will
consider the \emph{normalized} solution space $V(I)$. Let $F$ be a finite set
of polynomials, with bounded solution space. Then there is an instance $I$ of
the NPP, which has a rationally-equivalent normalized solution space $V(I)$.
Two sets $V$ and $W$ are rationally equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism
$f : V \rightarrow W$ such that both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are given by rational
functions. A function $f:V\rightarrow W$ is a homeomorphism, if it is
continuous, invertible and its inverse is continuous as well. As a corollary,
we show that NPP is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete. This implies that unless
$\exists \mathbb{R} =$ NP, the NPP is not contained in the complexity class NP.
Note that those results already follow from a recent paper by Shitov. Our proof
is geometric and arguably easier.

the injected planetary and stellar activity signals with low false alarm

simple and complex active region. Methods. We studied simple ($\alpha$ and
$\beta$) and complex ($\beta\gamma$ and $\beta\gamma\delta$) active regions
based on the Mount Wilson magnetic classification by applying our newly
developed daily approach. We analyzed the daily number of the simple active
regions (SARs) and compared that to the abundance of the complex active regions
(CARs) over the entire solar cycle 23 and cycle 24 until December 2018.
Results. We show that CARs evolve differently over the solar cycle from SARs.
The time evolution of SARs and CARs on different hemispheres also shows
differences, even though on average their latitudinal distributions are shown
to be similar. The time evolution of SARs closely follows that of the sunspot
number, and their maximum abundance was observed to occur during the early
maximum phase, while that of the CARs was seen roughly two years later. We
furthermore found that the peak of CARs was reached before the latitudinal
width of the activity band starts to decease. Conclusions. Our results suggest
that the active region formation process is a competition between the
large-scale dynamo (LSD) and the small-scale dynamo (SSD) near the surface, the
former varying cyclically and the latter being independent of the solar cycle.
During solar maximum, LSD is dominant, giving a preference to SARs, while

  Communications","BlackSeaCom'19",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC) is one of the most
promising and demanding services in 5G systems. This service requires very low
latency of less than $1-10$ ms and very high transmission reliability: the
acceptable packet loss ratio is about $10^{-5}$. To satisfy such strict
requirements, many issues shall be solved. This paper focuses on the link
adaptation problem, i.e., the selection of a modulation and coding scheme (MCS)
for transmission based on the received channel quality indicator (CQI) reports.
On the one hand, link adaptation should select a robust MCS to provide high
reliability. On the other hand, it should select the highest possible MCS to
reduce channel resource consumption. The paper shows that even for one URLLC
user, link adaptation is still a challenging problem, especially in
highly-variant channels. To solve this problem, a conservative link adaptation
algorithm is designed. The algorithm estimates the strongest channel
degradation at the time moment of the actual packet transmission and selects an
MCS taking into account the worst degradation. The obtained results show that
the proposed algorithm is efficient in terms of both the packet loss ratio and
the channel resource consumption.

The recently proposed quantile periodogram offers an alternative way to examine
this phenomena in the frequency domain. The quantile periodogram is constructed
from trigonometric quantile regression of time series data at different
frequencies and quantile levels. It is a useful tool for quantile-frequency
analysis (QFA) of nonlinear serial dependence. This paper introduces a number
of spectral divergence metrics based on the quantile periodogram for diagnostic
checks of financial time series models and model-based discriminant analysis.
The parametric bootstrapping technique is employed to compute the $p$-values of
the metrics. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated empirically
by a case study using the daily log returns of the S\&P 500 index over three
periods of time together with their GARCH-type models. The results show that
the QFA method is able to provide additional insights into the goodness of fit
of these financial time series models that may have been missed by conventional
tests. The results also show that the QFA method offers a more informative way

cycles. We estimate sub-solar stand-off distance of the magnetopause and bow
shock, and the shape of the magnetopause using numerical as well as empirical
models. The computed magnetopause and bow shock stand-off distances have been
found to be increasing steadily since around mid-1990's, consistent with the
steady declining trend seen in solar magnetic fields and solar wind
micro-turbulence levels. Similarly, we find an expansion in the shape of the

the shape of the magnetopause in 2020, the minimum of cycle 24, has been made.
Importantly, we also find two instances between 1968 and 1991 when the
magnetopause stand-off distance dropped to values close to 6.6 earth radii, the
geostationary orbit, for duration ranging from 9$-$11 hours and one event in

is relatively robust against load fluctuations but is more fragile to demand
shocks. For the underload-driven model without the recovery process, we found
an occurrence of a discontinuous phase transition. Differently from other
systems studied under overload cascading failures, this system is more robust

evaluating channel similarity through probabilistic modeling, we introduce a
pruning algorithm via hierarchical clustering of channels. In particular, the

touch along continuous lines in momentum space. In addition, we find evidence
for a third DNL close to the Fermi level which appears robust despite the
presence of significant spin orbit coupling. We demonstrate that the third DNL
gives rise to a topologically trivial flat-band surface state (FBSS) at the
(110) surface. This FBSS can be tuned by surface doping and presents an
interesting playground for the study of surface chemistry and exotic
correlation phenomena.

caused by the discrepancy between the orders of differential and integral
operators in the four dimensional QFTs. Therefore in view of the fact that
finiteness and invariant properties of operators are their topological aspects,
essential renormalization tools to extract finite invariant values from those
infinities which are comparable with the experimental results, e. g.
regularization, perturbation and radiative corrections follow some topological
standards. In the second part we consider dimensional and geometrical
consequences of topological approach to renormalization for the geometrical
structure and degrees of freedom of renormalized theory. We show that
regularization and renormalization of QED are performed only by certain
restrictive dimensional conditions on QED fields. Further it is shown that in
accord with our previous topological approach to renormalization of QED the
geometrical evaluation of applied dimensional renormalization conditions and
the appearance of anomalies refer to a reduction of number of degrees of

images processing, speech recognition; however, they are vulnerable to
adversarial examples, and this is a security issue worthy of attention. Because
the training process of DNNs converge the loss by updating the weights along
the gradient descent direction, many gradient-based methods attempt to destroy
the DNN model by adding perturbations in the gradient direction. Unfortunately,
as the model is nonlinear in most cases, the addition of perturbations in the
gradient direction does not necessarily increase loss. Thus, we propose a
random directed attack (RDA) for generating adversarial examples in this paper.
Rather than limiting the gradient direction to generate an attack, RDA searches
the attack direction based on hill climbing and uses multiple strategies to
avoid local optima that cause attack failure. Compared with state-of-the-art
gradient-based methods, the attack performance of RDA is very competitive.
Moreover, RDA can attack without any internal knowledge of the model, and its
performance under black-box attack is similar to that of the white-box attack
in most cases, which is difficult to achieve using existing gradient-based
attack methods.

provide better matching performance with one-shot and multi-shot enrollment. A
key novelty of our proposed architecture is that the framework can also be used
with zero-shot enrollment. This implies that our architecture does not need to
be re-trained even if a new subject is to be enrolled into the system. The
proposed architecture consists of two major components: a deep hashing (DH)
component, which is used for robust mapping of face images to their
corresponding intermediate binary codes, and a NND component, which corrects
errors in the intermediate binary codes that are caused by differences in the
enrollment and probe biometrics due to factors such as variation in pose,
illumination, and other factors. The final binary code generated by the NND is
then cryptographically hashed and stored as a secure face template in the
database. The efficacy of our approach with zero-shot, one-shot, and multi-shot
enrollments is shown for CMU-PIE, Extended Yale B, WVU multimodal and Multi-PIE
face databases. With zero-shot enrollment, the system achieves approximately
85% genuine accept rates (GAR) at 0.01% false accept rate (FAR), and with
one-shot and multi-shot enrollments, it achieves approximately 99.95% GAR at

Network, which aims at relieving the problem by equipping the model with
out-of-domain knowledge. CRN first tries its best to describe an image using
the existing vocabulary from in-domain knowledge. Due to the lack of
out-of-domain knowledge, the caption may be inaccurate or include ambiguous
words for the image with unknown (novel) objects. We propose to re-edit the
primary captioning sentence by a series of cascaded operations. We introduce a
perplexity predictor to find out which words are most likely to be inaccurate
given the input image. Thereafter, we utilize external knowledge from a
pre-trained object detection model and select more accurate words from
detection results by the visual matching module. In the last step, we design a
semantic matching module to ensure that the novel object is fit in the right
position. By this novel cascaded captioning-revising mechanism, CRN can
accurately describe images with unseen objects. We validate the proposed method

usingab-initio electronic structure calculations. From this calculation, we
have found the interesting effect of epitaxial strain on the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy (MCA). Analysis of the energy and k-resolved distribution of the
orbital character of the band structure reveals that MCA largely arises from
the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between dx2-y2 andd xz,yz orbitals of Fe atoms at
the FeRh/MgO interface. We demonstrate that the strain has significant effects
on the MCA: It not only affects the value of the MCA but also induces a
switching of the magnetic easy axis from perpendicular to in-plane direction.
The mechanism is the strain-induced shifts of the SOC d-states. Our work
demonstrates that strain engineering can open a viable pathway towards
tailoring magnetic properties for antiferromagetic spintronic applications.

is presented. The algorithm compensates the phase shift of the scattered field
from the receiver to the source for each frequency component in an
ultrawideband (UWB) and then integrates all the frequency responses. This
method resolves the multispeed and multipath issue when UWB signals propagate
in dispersive media. In addition, a multipath effect due to refraction on a
curved boundary is also explored. By collecting data using a customized
microwave measurement system of two different objects placed in a plastic
graduated cylinder filled with glycerin, along the measured dielectric
parameters of glycerin (a dispersive medium), highquality reconstructed images
are formed using PSAS. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with two other
traditional time-shift radar-based microwave imaging algorithms for the same
objects under test demonstrate the advantages of PSAS.

significant challenge despite its importance in a broad array of applications.
To this end, we explore road network extraction at scale with inference of
semantic features of the graph, identifying speed limits and route travel times
for each roadway. We call this approach City-Scale Road Extraction from
Satellite Imagery v2 (CRESIv2), Including estimates for travel time permits
true optimal routing (rather than just the shortest geographic distance), which
is not possible with existing remote sensing imagery based methods. We evaluate
our method using two sources of labels (OpenStreetMap, and those from the
SpaceNet dataset), and find that models both trained and tested on SpaceNet
labels outperform OpenStreetMap labels by greater than 60%. We quantify the
performance of our algorithm with the Average Path Length Similarity (APLS) and
map topology (TOPO) graph-theoretic metrics over a diverse test area covering
four cities in the SpaceNet dataset. For a traditional edge weight of geometric
distance, we find an aggregate of 5% improvement over existing methods for
SpaceNet data. We also test our algorithm on Google satellite imagery with
OpenStreetMap labels, and find a 23% improvement over previous work. Metric
scores decrease by only 4% on large graphs when using travel time rather than
geometric distance for edge weights, indicating that optimizing routing for
travel time is feasible with this approach.

gravitational lensing and deflection angle for the photons coupling with Weyl
tensor in a Kiselev black hole. Here, we have extended the prior work of Chen
and Jing \cite{1} for Schwarzschild black hole to Kiselev black hole. For this
purpose, the equation of motion for the photons coupled to Weyl tensor, null
geodesic and equation of photon sphere in a Kiselev black hole spacetime have
been formulated. It is found that the equation of motion of the photons depends
not only on the coupling between photon and Weyl tensor, but also on the
polarization direction of the photons. There is a critical value of the
coupling parameter $\alpha$ for existence of the marginally circular photon
orbit outside the event horizon, which depends on the parameters of black hole
and the polarization direction of photons. Further, the polarization directions
of coupled photon and the coupling parameter $\alpha$, both modify the features
of the photon sphere, the angle of deflection and the functions $(\bar{a}$ and
$\bar{b})$ for the strong gravitational lensing in Kiselev black hole
spacetime. In addition to this, the observable gravitational lensing quantities
and the shadows of the Kiselev black hole spacetime are presented in detail.

object and/or an electrical property distribution by measuring the scattered
field from many positions surrounding the object. Over the past few decades,
both the hardware and software components of a near-field microwave imaging
system technology have attracted interest throughout the world. Due to
limitations of hardware technology (unavailability of data acquisition
apparatus), experimental microwave imaging is very challenging for the
pioneers. However, Probably due to the hardware cost, most of the studies
(operating at a few GHz) were still focused on software only. The feasibility
of using microwave approaches to image different types of objects have been
tested and verified by simulations in a variety of applications. Further, work
has been conducted on improving both quantitative and qualitative algorithms to
improve simulated reconstruction results. Nowadays, benefitting from the
hardware progress and reduction of their cost, researchers are eager to pursue
real experimental validations instead of simulations, and, more unique
prototypes and commercial systems have been built for various applications.
These prototypes and systems are a result of years of dedicated work and it is
important to review the advancements in developed prototype systems. The
article will provide an overview of the many of the systems designed from
different research groups throughout the world, for applications of near-field
microwave imaging. The article further outlines challenges faced in current
microwave near-field imaging, developmental tendencies of engineers and
