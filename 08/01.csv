oxide. We use first-principles calculations to investigate the limitations to
its transparency due to free-carrier absorption mediated by phonons or charged
defects. We find that the main contribution to the phonon-assisted indirect
absorption is due to emission (as opposed to absorption) of phonons, which
explains why the process is relatively insensitive to temperature. The
wavelength dependence of this indirect absorption process can be described by a
power law. Indirect absorption mediated by charged defects or impurities is
also unavoidable since doping is required to obtain conductivity. At high
carrier concentrations, screening by the free carriers becomes important. We
find that charged-impurity-assisted absorption becomes larger than
phonon-assisted absorption for impurity concentrations above 10$^{20}$
cm$^{-3}$. The differences in the photon-energy dependence of the two processes
can be explained by band-structure effects.

in the paraconductivity measured in transport above the superconducting
critical temperature $T_c$. This behavior was interpreted in terms of an
anomalous diffusion of fluctuating Cooper pairs, that display a {\em

fluctuating Cooper pairs in the absence of stable preformed pairs, setting the
stage for an intermediate behavior between the two common paradigms in the

setting the surrounding fluid into motion. According to the kind of far-field
fluid flow that they induce, they are classified into pushers and pullers. Many
studies have explored similarities and differences between suspensions of
either pushers or pullers, but the behavior of mixtures of the two is still to
be investigated. Here, we rely on a minimal discrete microswimmer model,
particle-resolved, including hydrodynamic interactions, to examine the
orientational ordering in such binary pusher-puller mixtures. In agreement with
existing literature, we find that our monodisperse suspensions of pushers do
not show alignment, whereas those of solely pullers spontaneously develop
ordered collective motion. By continuously varying the composition of the
binary mixtures, starting from pure puller systems, we find that ordered
collective motion is largely maintained up to pusher-puller composition ratios
of about 1:2. Surprisingly, pushers when surrounded by a majority of pullers
are more tightly aligned than indicated by the average overall orientational
order in the system. Our study outlines how orientational order can be tuned in
active microswimmer suspensions to a requested degree by doping with other

alleviating the domain shift between the labeled source data and the unlabeled
target data. In this work, we achieve cross-modality domain adaptation, i.e.
between CT and MRI images, via disentangled representations. Compared to
learning a one-to-one mapping as the state-of-art CycleGAN, our model recovers
a many-to-many mapping between domains to capture the complex cross-domain
relations. It preserves semantic feature-level information by finding a shared
content space instead of a direct pixelwise style transfer. Domain adaptation
is achieved in two steps. First, images from each domain are embedded into two
spaces, a shared domain-invariant content space and a domain-specific style
space. Next, the representation in the content space is extracted to perform a
task. We validated our method on a cross-modality liver segmentation task, to
train a liver segmentation model on CT images that also performs well on MRI.
Our method achieved Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.81, outperforming a
CycleGAN-based method of 0.72. Moreover, our model achieved good generalization
to joint-domain learning, in which unpaired data from different modalities are
jointly learned to improve the segmentation performance on each individual
modality. Lastly, under a multi-modal target domain with significant diversity,
our approach exhibited the potential for diverse image generation and remained
effective with DSC of 0.74 on multi-phasic MRI while the CycleGAN-based method
performed poorly with a DSC of only 0.52.

existence of some remnants that show a bilateral morphology in the X-rays and

upon the inclination angle between the shock normal and the large scale
magnetic field in which the shock propagates. This interpretation is
additionally supported by recent particle-in-cell simulations that show how
ions are not injected if the shock is more oblique than $\sim 45^{o}$. These
shocks provide an excellent test bench for the process of reacceleration at the
same shock: non-thermal seed particles that are reached by the shock front are
automatically injected and accelerated. This process was recently discussed as
a possible reason for some anomalous behaviour of the spectra of secondary

Background Independence - can at the classical level be described solely by of
Lie's Mathematics. This comprises i) Lie derivatives to encode Relationalism,
including via solving the generalized Killing equation. ii) Lie brackets to
formulate Closure, via Lie's Algorithm suitably extended to accommodate Dirac
and topological insights, producing generator Lie algebraic structures: Lie
algebras or algebroids. iii) Observables defined by Lie brackets relations,
recastable as explicit PDE systems to be solved using the Flow Method, and
constitute observables Lie algebras. iv) The `passing families of theories
through the Dirac Algorithm' approach to Spacetime Construction from Space, and
to obtaining more structure from less internally to each of space and spacetime
separately, are identified as deformations that work selectively when Lie
Algebraic Rigidity is encountered. v) Reallocation of Intermediary-Object (RIO)
Invariance: the general Lie Theory's commuting-pentagon analogue of posing
Refoliation Invariance for GR. i) to v) cover respectively the Relationalism,
Closure, Observables, Deformations and RIO super-aspects of Background
Independence, Lie Theory moreover already collates i) to iii) and the internal
case of iv) as multiple interacting aspects. The Problem of Time's multiple
interacting facets are then explained as, firstly, having 2 copies of this Lie
collation, 1 for each of spacetime and space primalities. Secondly, a
Wheelerian two-way route between these two primalities, comprising v) and iv)'s
`spacetime from space' version. We further develop the Comparative Theory of
Background Independence thus. We can even give a `pillars of the Foundations of
Geometry' parallel of our Background Independence super-aspects.

the expense of the dissipation of magnetic or kinetic energy. Therefore,
understanding the processes that can trigger this dissipation is key to the
characterization of the energy budgets and particle acceleration mechanisms at
action in active galaxies. Instabilities and entrainment are two obvious
candidates to trigger dissipation. On the one hand, supersonic, relativistic
flows threaded by helical fields, as expected from the standard formation
models of jets in supermassive black-holes, are unstable to a series of
magnetohydrodynamical instabilities, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz,
current-driven, or possibly the pressure-driven instabilities. Furthermore, in
the case of expanding jets, the Rayleigh-Taylor and centrifugal instabilities
may also develop. With all these destabilizing processes at action, a natural
question is how can some jets keep their collimated structure along hundreds of
kiloparsecs. On the other hand, the interaction of the jet with stars and
clouds of gas that cross the flow in their orbits around the galactic centers
provides another scenario in which kinetic energy can be efficiently converted
into internal energy and particles can be accelerated to non-thermal energies.
In this contribution, I review the conditions under which these processes occur
and their role both in jet evolution and propagation and energy dissipation.

tasks is challenging. Specifically, it is important to understand how
quantitative measurements of employee achievements relate to supervisor
expectations, what the main drivers of good performance are, and how to combine
these complex and flexible performance evaluation metrics into an accurate
portrayal of organizational performance in order to identify shortcomings and
improve overall productivity. To facilitate this process, we summarize common
organizational performance analyses into four visual exploration task
categories. Additionally, we develop MetricsVis, a visual analytics system
composed of multiple coordinated views to support the dynamic evaluation and
comparison of individual, team, and organizational performance in public safety
organizations. MetricsVis provides four primary visual components to expedite
performance evaluation: (1) a priority adjustment view to support direct
manipulation on evaluation metrics; (2) a reorderable performance matrix to
demonstrate the details of individual employees; (3) a group performance view
that highlights aggregate performance and individual contributions for each
group; and (4) a projection view illustrating employees with similar
specialties to facilitate shift assignments and training. We demonstrate the

ionization channels, averaged over multiple wave packets, are extracted for
neon $2p$ electrons as a function of emission angle at photoelectron energies
7.9, 10.2, and 16.6 eV. $\Delta \tilde \eta$ is nearly constant for emission
parallel to the electric vector but increases at 10.2 eV for emission
perpendicular to the electric vector. We model our observations with both
perturbation and \textit{ab initio} theory, and find excellent agreement. In
the existing method for attosecond measurement, Reconstruction of Attosecond
Beating By Interference of Two-photon Transitions (RABBITT), a phase difference
between two-photon pathways involving absorption and emission of an infrared

defines a spectrahedron $S(p)$ containing $C(p)$. The proof of the containment
uses the characterization of real zero polynomials in two variables by Helton
and Vinnikov. We exhibit many cases where $C(p)=S(p)$.
  In terms of optimization theory, we introduce a small semidefinite relaxation
of a potentially huge hyperbolic program. If the hyperbolic program is a linear
program, we introduce even a finitely convergent hierachy of semidefinite
relaxations. With some extra work, we discuss the homogeneous setup where real
zero polynomials correspond to homogeneous polynomials and rigidly convex sets
correspond to hyperbolicity cones.
  The main aim of our construction is to attack the generalized Lax conjecture
saying that $C(p)$ is always a spectrahedron. To this end, we conjecture that
real zero polynomials in fixed degree can be ""amalgamated"" and show it in three
special cases with three completely different proofs. We show that this
conjecture would imply the following partial result towards the generalized Lax
conjecture: Given finitely many planes in $\mathbb R^n$, there is a
spectrahedron containing $C(p)$ that coincides with $C(p)$ on each of these
planes. This uses again the result of Helton and Vinnikov.

we consider nonstationary versions of first-order and second-order stationary

offline nonconvex optimization. In the case of second-order stationary solution
based regret, we propose and analyze online and bandit versions of the cubic
regularized Newton's method. The bandit version is based on estimating the
Hessian matrices in the bandit setting, based on second-order Gaussian Stein's
identity. Our nonstationary regret bounds in terms of second-order stationary
solutions have interesting consequences for avoiding saddle points in the
bandit setting. Next, for weakly quasi convex functions and monotone weakly
submodular functions we consider nonstationary regret measures in terms of
function-values; such structured classes of nonconvex functions enable one to
consider regret measure defined in terms of function values, similar to convex
functions. For this case of function-value, and first-order stationary solution

requirements both by co-processing with a classical processor and by
structuring computation into many subproblems. Each quantum subproblem involves
a separate state preparation terminated by the measurement of one Pauli string.
However, the number of such Pauli strings scales as $N^4$ for typical problems
of interest--a daunting growth rate that poses a serious limitation for
emerging applications such as quantum computational chemistry. We introduce a
systematic technique for minimizing requisite state preparations by exploiting
the simultaneous measurability of partitions of commuting Pauli strings. Our
work encompasses algorithms for efficiently approximating a
MIN-COMMUTING-PARTITION, as well as a synthesis tool for compiling simultaneous
measurement circuits. For representative problems, we achieve 8-30x reductions

demonstrate experimental validation of our techniques by estimating the ground

uncertainties associated with the modelling of extra QCD radiation in ttbb
events, in this paper we present a calculation of pp->ttbbj at NLO QCD. The
behaviour of NLO corrections is analysed in a variety of observables, and to
assess theoretical uncertainties we use factor-two rescalings as well as
different dynamic scales. In this context, we propose a systematic alignment of
dynamic scales that makes it possible to disentangle normalisation and shape
uncertainties in a transparent way. Scale uncertainties at NLO are typically at
the level of 20-30% in fiducial cross sections, and below 10% for the shapes of
distributions. The kinematics of QCD radiation is investigated in detail,
including the effects of its recoil on the objects of the ttbb system. In
particular, we discuss various azimuthal correlations that allow one to
charaterise the QCD recoil pattern in a precise and transparent way. In
general, the calculation at hand provides a variety of precise benchmarks that
can be used to validate the modelling of QCD radiation in ttbb generators.
Moreover, as we will argue, pp->ttbbj at NLO entails information that can be
used to gain insights into the perturbative convergence of the inclusive ttbb
cross section beyond NLO. Based on this idea, we address the issue of the large
NLO K-factor observed in the ttbb cross section, and we provide evidence that
supports the reduction of this K-factor through a mild adjustment of the QCD
scales that are conventionally used for this process. The presented 2->5 NLO

it as an objective for representation learning may lead to highly entangled
representations due to its invariance under arbitrary invertible
transformations. Nevertheless, these methods have been repeatedly shown to
excel in practice. In this paper we argue, and provide empirical evidence, that
the success of these methods cannot be attributed to the properties of MI

$\pm 1/4$. We estimate the regime of stability of the ferromagnetic phase
around the chiral limit by studying the exactly calculated spectrum of
one-magnon excitations. The instability of the ferromagnetic state is signaled
by a negative magnon excitation energy. This approach allows us to deform the
results of the idealized chiral model (by increasing the bandwidth and/or
modified interactions) towards more realistic systems. Furthermore, we use the
low energy part of the exact one-magnon spectrum to calculate the
spin-stiffness of the Goldstone modes throughout the ferromagnetic phase. The

magnetar magnetospheres that demonstrate the instability of certain degenerate,
high energy equilibrium solutions of the Grad-Shafranov equation. This result
indicates the existence of an unstable branch of twisted magnetospheric
solutions and allows to formulate an instability criterion. The rearrangement
of magnetic field lines as a consequence of this instability triggers the
dissipation of up to 30% of the magnetospheric energy on a thin layer above the
magnetar surface. During this process, we predict an increase of the mechanical
stresses onto the stellar crust, which can potentially result in a global
mechanical failure of a significant fraction of it. We find that the estimated
energy release and the emission properties are compatible with the observed
giant flare events. The newly identified instability is a candidate for
recurrent energy dissipation, which could explain part of the phenomenology
observed in magnetars.

cannot be deformed to a trivial phase without breaking the symmetry or closing
the bulk gap. Here, we introduce a new notion of a topological obstruction that
is not captured by bulk energy gap closings in periodic boundary conditions.
More specifically, we say two bulk Hamiltonians belong to distinct boundary
obstructed topological `phases' (BOTPs) if they can be deformed to each other
on a system with periodic boundaries, but cannot be deformed to each other for
symmetric open boundaries without closing the gap at at least one high symmetry
region on the surface. BOTPs are not topological phases of matter in the
standard sense since they are adiabatically deformable to each other on a torus
but, similar to SPTs, they are associated with boundary signatures in open
systems such as surface states or fractional corner or hinge charges. We show
that the double-mirror quadrupole model of [Science, 357(6346), 2018] is a
prototypical example of such phases, and present a detailed analysis of several
aspects of boundary obstructions in this model. In addition, we introduce
several three-dimensional models having boundary obstructions, which are
characterized either by surface states or fractional corner or hinge charges.
We also provide a general framework to study boundary obstructions in
free-fermion systems in terms of Wannier band representations (WBR), an
extension of the recently-developed band representation formalism to Wannier
bands. WBRs capture the notion of topological obstructions in the Wannier bands
which can then be used to study topological obstructions in the boundary
spectrum by means of the correspondence between the Wannier and boundary
spectra. This establishes a form of bulk-boundary correspondence for BOTPs by
relating the bulk band representation to the boundary topology.

always subdominant to electron scattering when the mediator is light, but that
Migdal-induced ionization can dominate over electron scattering for heavy
mediators and DM masses in the hundreds of MeV range. We put these two
ionization processes on identical theoretical footing, address some theoretical
uncertainties in the choice of atomic wavefunctions used to compute rates, and
discuss the implications for DM scenarios where the Migdal process dominates,

no evidence for a solar-system-like correlation between planet mass and
atmospheric metallicity, but instead identify a potential (1.9 sigma)
correlation between the inferred methane/(carbon monoxide + carbon dioxide)
ratio and stellar metallicity. Our ability to characterize this potential trend
is limited by the relatively large uncertainties in the stellar metallicity

analyzing the behavior of the spacetime metric near the corners of the causal

that the fluxes of all such symmetries is conserved between the past and future

Tremaine-Weinberg method to estimate the pattern speed of the bar. The HI bar
is found to have an average pattern speed of $23.3 \pm 5.9$ km/s/kpc.
Interestingly, for the first time, we find that the observed pattern speeds of
the bar in the two kinematic halves are different. We identify the origin of
this difference to be the kinematic asymmetry. This observed offset in the
pattern speed serves to put a stringent constraint on the lifetime of the bar
set by the winding timescale. The lifetime of the bar is found to be $\sim 5.3

the disc. We also find the HI bar in DDO 168 to be a weak bar with a strength
of $\sim 0.2$. If HI bar being weak can be easily disturbed, this could
possibly explain why it is extremely rare to observe HI bars in galaxies. We
estimate the bar radius to be $\sim 1$ kpc and the dimensionless ratio,
$R_L/R_b$ to be $\geq$ 2.1 indicating a `slow' bar in DDO 168. Our results

$W+$ charm production data to the original CT14NNLO PDFs. By comparison of the
$g(x,Q)$, $s(x,Q)$, $u(x,Q)$, $d(x,Q)$, $\bar u(x,Q)$, and $\bar d(x,Q)$ PDFs
at $Q=1.3$ GeV and $Q = 100$ GeV for the CT14NNLO and CT14NNLO+Wc, we see that
the error band of the $s(x,Q)$ PDF is reduced in the region $x<0.4$, and the
error band of $g(x,Q)$ PDF is also slightly reduced in the region $0.01 < x <
0.1$.

  using CI Auditory Stimuli","Interspeech 2019",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Speaker recognition is a biometric modality that uses underlying speech
information to determine the identity of the speaker. Speaker Identification
(SID) under noisy conditions is one of the challenging topics in the field of
speech processing, specifically when it comes to individuals with cochlear
implants (CI). This study analyzes and quantifies the ability of CI-users to
perform speaker identification based on direct electric auditory stimuli. CI
users employ a limited number of frequency bands (8 to 22) and use electrodes
to directly stimulate the Basilar Membrane/Cochlear in order to recognize the
speech signal. The sparsity of electric stimulation within the CI frequency
range is a prime reason for loss in human speech recognition, as well as SID
performance. Therefore, it is assumed that CI-users might be unable to
recognize and distinguish a speaker given dependent information such as formant
frequencies, pitch etc. which are lost to un-simulated electrodes. To quantify
this assumption, the input speech signal is processed using a CI Advanced
Combined Encoder (ACE) signal processing strategy to construct the CI auditory
electrodogram. The proposed study uses 50 speakers from each of three different
databases for training the system using two different classifiers under quiet,
and tested under both quiet and noisy conditions. The objective result shows
that, the CI users can effectively identify a limited number of speakers.
However, their performance decreases when more speakers are added in the
system, as well as when noisy conditions are introduced. This information could
therefore be used for improving CI-user signal processing techniques to improve
human SID.

of ceramic and metallic properties. Point-defects are known to play a vital
role in the structural, electronic and transport properties of alloys in
general and this system in particular. As some MAX phases have been shown to be
stable in non-stoichiometric compositions, it is likely that such alloying
effects will affect the behavior of lattice point defects. This problem,
however, remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the
alloying effect on the structural-stability, energy-stability,
electronic-structure, and diffusion barrier of point defects in MAX phase
alloys within a first-principles density functional theory framework. The
vacancy (V$_{M}$, V$_{A}$, V$_{X}$) and antisite (M-A; M-X) defects are
considered with M and A site disorder in (Zr-M)$_{2}$(AA${'}$)C, where
M=Cr,Nb,Ti and AA${'}$=Al, Al-Sn, Pb-Bi. Our calculations suggest that the
chemical disorder helps lower the V$_{A}$ formation energies compared to
V$_{M}$ and V$_{X}$. The V$_{A}$ diffusion barrier is also significantly
reduced for M-site disorder compared to their ordered counterpart. This is very
important finding because reduced barrier height will ease the Al diffusion at
high-operating temperatures, which will help the formation of passivating oxide
layer (i.e., Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ in aluminum-based MAX phases) and will slow down
or stop the material degradation. We believe that our study will provide a
fundamental understanding and an approach to tailor the key properties that can
lead to the discovery of new MAX phases.

strongly-convex finite-sum optimization problems. In contrast to the majority
of existing theoretical works, which assume that individual functions are
sampled with replacement, we focus here on popular but poorly-understood
heuristics, which involve going over random permutations of the individual
functions. This setting has been investigated in several recent works, but the
optimal error rates remain unclear. In this paper, we provide lower bounds on
the expected optimization error with these heuristics (using SGD with any
constant step size), which elucidate their advantages and disadvantages. In
particular, we prove that after $k$ passes over $n$ individual functions, if
the functions are re-shuffled after every pass, the best possible optimization
error for SGD is at least $\Omega\left(1/(nk)^2+1/nk^3\right)$, which partially
corresponds to recently derived upper bounds. Moreover, if the functions are
only shuffled once, then the lower bound increases to $\Omega(1/nk^2)$. Since
there are strictly smaller upper bounds for repeated reshuffling, this proves
an inherent performance gap between SGD with single shuffling and repeated
shuffling. As a more minor contribution, we also provide a non-asymptotic
$\Omega(1/k^2)$ lower bound (independent of $n$) for the incremental gradient
method, when no random shuffling takes place. Finally, we provide an indication
that our lower bounds are tight, by proving matching upper bounds for
univariate quadratic functions.

$\sqrt{s}$. The renormalization scale $Q^2$ of the running coupling depends
dynamically on the virtuality of the underlying quark and gluon subprocess and
thus the specific kinematics of each event. The determination of the
renormalization scale for event shape distributions is obtained by using the
Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), a rigorous scale-setting method for
gauge theories which satisfies all the requirements of Renormalization Group
Invariance, including renormalization-scheme independence and consistency with
Abelian theory in the $N_C \to 0$ limit. In this paper we apply the PMC to two
classic event shapes measured in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation: the thrust ($T$) and
C-parameter ($C$). The PMC renormalization scale depends differentially on the
values of $T$ and $C$. The application of PMC scale-setting determines the
running coupling $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ to high precision over a wide range of $Q^2$
from $10$ to $250~\rm{GeV}^2$ from measurements of the event shape
distributions at the $Z^0$ peak. The extrapolation of the running coupling
using pQCD evolution gives the value $\alpha_s(M^2_Z)=0.1185\pm0.0012$ from the
thrust, and $\alpha_s(M^2_Z)=0.1193^{+0.0021}_{-0.0019}$ from the C-parameter
in the $\bar{\rm{MS}}$ scheme. These determinations of $\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$ are
consistent with the world average and are more precise than the values obtained
from analyses of event shapes currently used in the world average. The
highly-consistent results for the $T$ and $C$ event-shape distributions provide
an additional verification of the applicability of the PMC to pQCD.

literature, mostly focusing on the impact of the accompanying boson emission,
which contributes to the cross sections through an exponential function of the
center-of-mass energy. We focus instead on the impact of exotic fermions
charged under $SU(2)_L$, which not only can be emitted in these processes, but
also affect the non-exponential contributions to the cross-sections. Estimating
the latter using instanton techniques, we find sizable effects that suggest
that if $B+L$-violating processes are ever seen at colliders, they may involve
physics beyond the Standard Model.

position, but they can also be prone to systematic biases (e.g., color category
boundaries can distort perceived differences between hues). By comparison,
position's high level of precision may seem to protect it from such biases. In
contrast, across three empirical studies, we show that while position may be a
precise form of data encoding, it can also produce systematic biases in how
values are visually encoded, at least for reports of average position across a
short delay. In displays with a single line or a single set of bars, reports of
average positions were significantly biased, such that line positions were
underestimated and bar positions were overestimated. In displays with multiple
data series (i.e., multiple lines and/or sets of bars), this systematic bias
still persisted. We also observed an effect of ""perceptual pull"", where the
average position estimate for each series was 'pulled' toward the other. These
findings suggest that, although position may still be the most precise form of
visual data encoding, it can also be systematically biased.

broadening and polarization in atomic and molecular lines. Similar to the Sun,
these fields are complex and height-dependent. Many molecular lines dominating
M-dwarf spectra (e.g., FeH, CaH, MgH, and TiO) are temperature -- and Zeeman --
sensitive and form at different atmospheric heights, which makes them excellent
probes of magnetic fields on M dwarfs. Our goal is to analyze the complexity of
magnetic fields in M dwarfs. We investigate how magnetic fields vary with the
stellar temperature and how ""surface"" inhomogeneities are distributed in height
-- the dimension that is usually neglected in stellar magnetic studies. We have
determined effective temperatures of the photosphere and of magnetic features,
magnetic field strengths and filling factors for nine M dwarfs (M1-M7). Our
chi^2 analysis is based on a comparison of observed and synthetic intensity and
circular polarization profiles. Stokes profiles were calculated by solving
polarized radiative transfer equations. Properties of magnetic structures
depend on the analyzed atomic or molecular species and their formation heights.
Two types of magnetic features similar to those on the Sun have been found: a
cooler (starspots) and a hotter (network) one. The magnetic field strength in
both starspots and network is within 3 kG to 6 kG, on average it is 5 kG. These
fields occupy a large fraction of M dwarf atmospheres at all heights, up to
100%. The plasma beta is less than one, implying highly magnetized stars. A
combination of molecular and atomic species and a simultaneous analysis of
intensity and circular polarization spectra have allowed us to better decipher
the complexity of magnetic fields on M dwarfs, including their dependence on
the atmospheric height. This work provides an opportunity to investigate a

ability to volitionally modulate localized brain activity as a therapy for

scientific inquiry. Previous research suggests that coherent activity across
diverse cognitive systems is a hallmark of individuals who can successfully
learn to control the BCI. However, little is known about how these distributed
networks interact through time to support learning. Here, we address this gap
in knowledge by constructing and applying a multimodal network approach to
decipher brain-behavior relations in motor imagery-based brain-computer
interface learning using MEG. Specifically, we employ a minimally constrained
matrix decomposition method (non-negative matrix factorization) to
simultaneously identify regularized, covarying subgraphs of functional
connectivity, to assess their similarity to task performance, and to detect
their time-varying expression. Individuals also displayed marked variation in
the spatial properties of subgraphs such as the connectivity between the
frontal lobe and the rest of the brain, and in the temporal properties of
subgraphs such as the stage of learning at which they reached maximum
expression. From these observations, we posit a conceptual model in which
certain subgraphs support learning by modulating brain activity in regions
important for sustaining attention. To test this model, we use tools that
stipulate regional dynamics on a networked system (network control theory), and
find that good learners display a single subgraph whose temporal expression
tracked performance and whose architecture supports easy modulation of brain

networks, form polar liquid crystals. These systems are `active' or
far-from-equilibrium, due to local forcing of the solvent by the constituent
particles. In many cases the source of activity is chiral; since forcing is
internally generated, some sort of `torque dipole' is then present locally. But
it is not obvious how `torque dipoles' should be encoded in the hydrodynamic
equations that describe the system at continuum level: different authors have
arrived at contradictory conclusions on this issue. In this work, we resolve
the paradox by presenting a careful derivation, from linear irreversible
thermodynamics, of the general equations of motion of a single-component chiral
active fluid with spin degrees of freedom. We find that there is no unique
hydrodynamic description for such a fluid in the presence of torque dipoles of
a given strength. Instead, at least three different hydrodynamic descriptions
emerge, depending on whether we decompose each torque dipole as two point
torques, two force pairs, or one point torque and one force pair -- where point
torques create internal angular momenta of the chiral bodies (spin), whereas
force pairs impart centre of mass motion that contributes to fluid velocity. By
considering a general expansion of the Onsager coefficients, we also derive a
new shear-elongation parameter and cross-coupling viscosity, which can lead to
unpredicted phenomena even in passive polar liquid crystals. Finally,
elimination of the angular variables gives an effective polar hydrodynamics
with renormalized active stresses, viscosities and kinetic coefficients.
Remarkably, this can include a direct contribution of chiral activity to the
equation of motion for the polar order parameter, which survives even in `dry'
active systems where the fluid velocity is set to zero.

belief about future consumption (""news utility""), with diminishing sensitivity
over the magnitude of news. Diminishing sensitivity induces a preference over
news skewness: gradual bad news, one-shot good news is worse than one-shot
resolution, which is in turn worse than gradual good news, one-shot bad news.
So, the agent's preference between gradual information and one-shot resolution
can depend on his consumption ranking of different states. In a dynamic
cheap-talk framework where a benevolent sender communicates the state over
multiple periods, the babbling equilibrium is essentially unique without loss
aversion. More loss-averse agents may enjoy higher news utility in equilibrium,
contrary to the commitment case. We characterize the family of gradual good
news equilibria that exist with high enough loss aversion, and find the sender
conveys progressively larger pieces of good news. We discuss applications to
media competition and game shows.

Careful consideration has been taken during the initiation of the growth

of undesirable interfacial layers that can form due to the lack of common anion
between the two materials. A superlattice structure of 100 periods of
alternating QD and spacer layers is analyzed by high resolution X-ray

used following continuum elastic theory to deduce the size of the dots and the

are composed from clauses chosen uniformly randomly and independently of each
other. This model may be unsatisfactory in that it fails to describe various
features of SAT instances, arising in real-world applications. Various
modifications have been suggested to define models of industrial SAT. Here, we
focus mainly on the aspect of community structure. Namely, here the set of
variables consists of a number of disjoint communities, and clauses tend to
consist of variables from the same community. Thus, we suggest a model of
random industrial SAT, in which the central generalization with respect to
random SAT is the additional community structure.
  There has been a lot of work on the satisfiability threshold of random
$k$-SAT, starting with the calculation of the threshold of $2$-SAT, up to the
recent result that the threshold exists for sufficiently large $k$.
  In this paper, we endeavor to study the satisfiability threshold for the
proposed model of random industrial SAT. Our main result is that the threshold
in this model tends to be smaller than its counterpart for random SAT.
Moreover, under some conditions, this threshold even vanishes.

not only the well known bright soliton solutions but also novel quantum
droplets for a strongly coupled case. For larger systems, basing on microscopic
properties of the found few-body solution, we propose a new equation for a
density amplitude of atoms. It accounts for fermionization for strongly
repelling bosons by incorporating the Lieb-Liniger energy in a local density
approximation and approaches the standard Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) in
the weakly interacting limit. Not only does such a framework provide an
alternative mechanism of the droplet stability, but it also introduces means to
further analyze this previously unexplored quantum phase. In the limiting
strong repulsion case, yet another simple multi-atom model is proposed. We
stress that the celebrated Lee-Huang-Yang term in the GPE is not applicable in
this case.

new feature of rogue waves in the Boussinesq equation is that the rogue wave of

While such transfer learning seems effective, it may not generalize well

Our model is meta-trained using known synthetic noise models, and then
fine-tuned with the small training set, with the real noise, as a few-shot

generated data during meta-training enables us to not only generate an infinite
number of training tasks, but also train a model to learn with small training

denoising results than supervised learning and transfer learning in three

outputs a tree as their structural average. We also highlight structural
similarities between the input and the average and incorporate uncertainty

deep in the matter era till the far future. For a given cosmological model in
GR or in modified gravity, the value of $\gamma(\Omega_{m})$ is unique when the
decaying mode of scalar perturbations is negligible. However,
$\gamma_{\infty}$, the value of $\gamma$ in the asymptotic future, is unique
even in the presence of a nonnegligible decaying mode today. Moreover $\gamma$
becomes arbitrarily large deep in the matter era. Only in the limit of a
vanishing decaying mode do we get a finite $\gamma$, from the past to the
future in this case. We find further a condition for $\gamma(\Omega_{m})$ to be
monotonically decreasing (or increasing). This condition can be violated inside
general relativity (GR) for varying $w_{DE}$ though generically
$\gamma(\Omega_{m})$ will be monotonically decreasing (like $\Lambda$CDM),
except in the far future and past. A bump or a dip in $G_{\rm eff}$ can also
lead to a significant and rapid change in the slope
$\frac{d\gamma}{d\Omega_{m}}$. On a $\Lambda$CDM background, a $\gamma$
substantially lower (higher) than $0.55$ with a negative (positive) slope
reflects the opposite evolution of $G_{\rm eff}$. In DGP models,
$\gamma(\Omega_{m})$ is monotonically increasing except in the far future.
While DGP gravity becomes weaker than GR in the future and $w^{DGP}\to -1$, we
still get $\gamma_{\infty}^{DGP}= \gamma_{\infty}^{\Lambda CDM}=\frac{2}{3}$.
In contrast, despite $G^{DGP}_{\rm eff}\to G$ in the past, $\gamma$ does not
tend to its value in GR because $\frac{dG^{DGP}_{\rm
eff}}{d\Omega_{m}}\Big|_{-\infty}\ne 0$.

Q-space trajectory encoding has been proposed for decoupling isotropic from

multiple Gaussian diffusion components. Here, we develop a more general
framework for resolving the underlying kurtosis sources. We introduce
Correlation Tensor MRI (CTI) - an approach harnessing the versatility of double
diffusion encoding (DDE) and capable of explicitly decoupling isotropic and
anisotropic kurtosis components from intra-compartmental kurtosis effects
arising from restricted diffusion. Additionally, CTI provides an index that is
potentially sensitive to intra-compartmental kurtosis. The theoretical
foundations of CTI, as well as the first proof-of-concept CTI ex vivo
experiments in mouse brains at a field of 16.4T, are presented. We find that
anisotropic and isotropic kurtosis can decouple microscopic anisotropy from
substantial partial volume effects between tissue and free water. Our
intra-compartmental kurtosis index exhibited positive values in both white and
grey matter tissues. Simulations in different microenvironments show, however,
that our current CTI protocol for estimating intra-compartmental kurtosis is
limited by higher-order terms that were not considered in this study. CTI
measurements were then extended to in vivo settings and used to map healthy rat
brains at 9.4T. These in vivo CTI results were consistent with our ex vivo
findings. Although future studies are still required to mitigate the
higher-order effects on the intra-compartmental kurtosis index, results show
that CTI's more general estimates of anisotropic and isotropic kurtosis
contributions are already ripe for future studies.

dielectric film from finite element analysis and microstrip line measurements.
Two transmission line equivalent circuit models were used for the cases of an
air-filled line and a lossless line, whose distributed elements can be
calculated from full wave finite element simulations. With these calculated
distributed elements and microstrip line measurements, the complex permittivity
was extracted. The technique utilizes a simple way to separate the dielectric
loss from the measured total loss and the complex permittivity was extracted
using the measured propagation constant. A rational dielectric model was
employed to fit the extracted complex permittivity, which ensures causality of
the final solution. The best fitting results obtained through this procedure
are considered as the final permittivity results, which have shown excellent
match to the data sheet values. Moreover, simulations using the fitted
permittivity exhibit good agreement with the experimental propagation constant
data of microstrip lines up to 60 GHz. The proposed method was demonstrated on
polyimide, and it can be applied to other thin film materials.

utilized in a unscented Kalman filter to estimate the sinkage exponent.
Simulations suggest this parameter can be estimated within 4% of its true value

quasiparticles in condensed matter physics, are currently attracting intense
interest due to exotic physical properties such as large magnetoresistance and
high carrier mobilities. Transition metal diarsenides such as MoAs2 and WAs2
have been reported to harbor very high magnetoresistance suggesting the
possible existence of a topological quantum state, although this conclusion
remains dubious. Here, based on systematic angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and parallel first-principles calculations,
we investigate the electronic properties of TAs2 (T = Mo, W). Importantly,
clear evidence for switching the single-Dirac cone surface state in MoAs2 with
the cleaving plane is observed, whereas a Dirac state is not observed in WAs2
despite its high magnetoresistance. Our study thus reveals the key role of the
terminated plane in a low-symmetry system, and provides a new perspective on
how termination can drive dramatic changes in electronic structures.

  version is accepted for publication in Neural Networks",,,,"cs.LG math.FA stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In much of the literature on function approximation by deep networks, the
function is assumed to be defined on some known domain, such as a cube or a
sphere. In practice, the data might not be dense on these domains, and
therefore, the approximation theory results are observed to be too
conservative. In manifold learning, one assumes instead that the data is
sampled from an unknown manifold; i.e., the manifold is defined by the data
itself. Function approximation on this unknown manifold is then a two stage
procedure: first, one approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator (and its
eigen-decomposition) on this manifold using a graph Laplacian, and next,
approximates the target function using the eigen-functions. Alternatively, one
estimates first some atlas on the manifold and then uses local approximation
techniques based on the local coordinate charts.
  In this paper, we propose a more direct approach to function approximation on
\emph{unknown}, data defined manifolds without computing the
eigen-decomposition of some operator or an atlas for the manifold, and without
any kind of training in the classical sense. Our constructions are universal;
i.e., do not require the knowledge of any prior on the target function other
than continuity on the manifold. We estimate the degree of approximation. For
smooth functions, the estimates do not suffer from the so-called saturation
phenomenon. We demonstrate via a property called good propagation of errors how
the results can be lifted for function approximation using deep networks where
each channel evaluates a Gaussian network on a possibly unknown manifold.

subsequent tidal disruption of a low-mass companion in the interior of a giant

a cold accretion disc embedded in the hot ambient around the proto-white dwarf.
Entrainment of hot material may evaporate the disc before it can sufficiently

Universe with high accuracy and few parameters. Despite its successes, a few
tensions persist; most notably, the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, as derived
from the Planck CMB data, largely overpredicts the abundance of SZ clusters
when using their standard mass calibration. Whether this is a sign of an
incorrect calibration or the need for new physics remains a matter of debate.
Here we examined two simple extensions of the standard model and their ability
to release this tension: massive neutrinos and a simple modified gravity model
via a non-standard growth index $\gamma$. We used both the Planck CMB and SZ
cluster counts as datasets, with or without local X-ray clusters. In the case
of massive neutrinos, the SZ calibration $(1-b)$ is constrained to
$0.59^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ (68\%), more than 5$\sigma$ away from its standard value
$\sim0.8$. We found little correlation between $\sum m_\nu$ and $(1-b)$,
corroborating previous conclusions derived from X-ray clusters; massive
neutrinos do not alleviate the cluster-CMB tension. With our simple $\gamma$
model, we found a large correlation between calibration and growth index but
contrary to local X-ray clusters, SZ clusters are able to break the degeneracy
between the two thanks to their extended $z$ range. The calibration $(1-b)$ was
then constrained to $0.60^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$, leading to an interesting
constraint on $\gamma=0.60\pm 0.13$. When both massive neutrinos and modified
gravity were allowed, preferred values remained centred on standard
$\Lambda$CDM values, but $(1-b)\sim0.8$ was allowed (though only at the
$2\sigma$ level) provided $\sum m_\nu\sim0.34 $ eV and $\gamma\sim0.8$. We
conclude that massive neutrinos do not relieve the cluster-CMB tension and that
a calibration close to the standard value $0.8$ would call for new physics in
the gravitational sector.

where the link or switch failures can happen, for application-specific
network-on-chips (ASNoC). With a user-defined number, K, we propose an integer
linear programming (ILP) based method to generate ASNoC topologies, which can
tolerate at most K faults in switches or links. Given the communication
requirements between cores and their floorplan, we first propose a
convex-cost-flow based method to solve a core mapping problem for building
connections between the cores and switches. Second, an ILP based method is
proposed to allocate K+1 switch-disjoint routing paths for every communication
flow between the cores. Finally, to reduce switch sizes, we propose sharing the
switch ports for the connections between the cores and switches and formulate
the port sharing problem as a clique-partitioning problem Additionally, we
propose an ILP-based method to simultaneously solve the core mapping and
routing path allocation problems when considering physical link failures only.
Experimental results show that the power consumptions of fault-tolerance
topologies increase almost linearly with K because of the routing path
redundancy. When both switch faults and link faults are considered, port
sharing can reduce the average power consumption of fault-tolerance topologies
with K = 1, K = 2 and K = 3 by 18.08%, 28.88%, and 34.20%, respectively. When
considering only the physical link faults, the experimental results show that
compared to the FTTG algorithm, the proposed method reduces power consumption
and hop count by 10.58% and 6.25%, respectively; compared to the DBG based
method, the proposed method reduces power consumption and hop count by 21.72%

different perspectives and organize sentences in a coherent way. In this paper,
we address three critical challenges for this task in a reinforcement learning
setting: the mode collapse, the delayed feedback, and the time-consuming
warm-up for policy networks. Generally, we propose a novel Curiosity-driven
Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework to jointly enhance the diversity and
accuracy of the generated paragraphs. First, by modeling the paragraph
captioning as a long-term decision-making process and measuring the prediction
uncertainty of state transitions as intrinsic rewards, the model is
incentivized to memorize precise but rarely spotted descriptions to context,
rather than being biased towards frequent fragments and generic patterns.
Second, since the extrinsic reward from evaluation is only available until the
complete paragraph is generated, we estimate its expected value at each time
step with temporal-difference learning, by considering the correlations between
successive actions. Then the estimated extrinsic rewards are complemented by
dense intrinsic rewards produced from the derived curiosity module, in order to
encourage the policy to fully explore action space and find a global optimum.
Third, discounted imitation learning is integrated for learning from human
demonstrations, without separately performing the time-consuming warm-up in
advance. Extensive experiments conducted on the Standford image-paragraph
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method,
improving the performance by 38.4% compared with state-of-the-art.

is challenging to take advantage of sparsity in training procedure because the
involved gradients are dynamically changed. Actually, an important observation

to zero and only have a tiny impact on weight-updating. Hence, we consider
pruning these very small gradients randomly to accelerate CNN training
according to the statistical distribution of activation gradients. Meanwhile,
we theoretically analyze the impact of pruning algorithm on the convergence.
The proposed approach is evaluated on AlexNet and ResNet-\{18, 34, 50, 101,

importance for providing renewable energy and solid-state cooling. Although
traditionally, the Seebeck effect plays a key role for the TE figure of merit
zST, it encounters fundamental constraints hindering its conversion efficiency.
Most notably, there are the charge compensation of electrons and holes that
diminishes this effect, and the intertwinement of the corresponding electrical
and thermal conductivities through the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law which makes
their independent optimization in zST impossible. Here, we demonstrate that in
the Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 the Nernst effect, i.e., the transverse counterpart
of the Seebeck effect, can generate a large TE figure of merit zNT. At room
temperature, zNT = 0.5 in a small field of 2 T; it significantly surmounts its
longitudinal counterpart zST for any field and further increases upon warming.
A large Nernst effect is generically expected in topological semimetals,
benefiting from both the bipolar transport of compensated electrons and holes
and their high mobilities. In this case, heat and charge transport are
orthogonal, i.e., not intertwined by the WF law anymore. More importantly,
further optimization of zNT by tuning the Fermi level to the Dirac node can be
anticipated due to not only the enhanced bipolar transport, but also the
anomalous Nernst effect arising from a pronounced Berry curvature. A
combination of the former topologically trivial and the latter nontrivial
advantages promises to open a new avenue towards high-efficient transverse
thermoelectricity.

subsequent Topology and Differential Geometry developments and extended to the
setting of contemporary Physics' state spaces. We now generalize this approach
by mild recategorization to one based on Nijenhuis' generalization of Lie's
Mathematics, as follows. 1) Relationalism is encoded using the Nijenhuis-Lie
derivative. 2) Closure is assessed using the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, and a
`Schouten-Nijenhuis Algorithm' analogue of the Dirac and Lie Algorithms. This
produces a class of Gerstenhaber algebraic structures of generators or of
constraints. 3) Observables are defined by a Schouten--Nijenhuis brackets
relation, reformulating the constrained canonical case as explicit PDEs to be
solved using the Flow Method, and forming their own Gerstenhaber algebras of
observables. Lattices of Schouten-Nijenhuis-Gerstenhaber constraint or
generator algebraic substructures furthermore induce dual lattices of
Gerstenhaber observables subalgebras. 4) Deformation of Gerstenhaber algebraic
structures of generators or constraints encountering Rigidity gives a means of
Constructing more structure from less. 5) Reallocation of Intermediary-Object
Invariance gives the general Schouten-Nijenhuis-Gerstenhaber algebraic
structure's analogue of posing Refoliation Invariance for GR. We finally point
to general Gerstenhaber bracket and Vinogradov bracket generalizations, with

priority within the field must be given to investments in the development of
both evolutionary and transformational detector development that is coordinated
across the national laboratories and with the university community,
international partners and other disciplines. While the fundamental science
questions addressed by high energy physics have never been more compelling,
there is acute awareness of the challenging budgetary and technical constraints
when scaling current technologies. Furthermore, many technologies are reaching
their sensitivity limit and new approaches need to be developed to overcome the
currently irreducible technological challenges. This situation is unfolding
against a backdrop of declining funding for instrumentation, both at the
national laboratories and in particular at the universities. This trend has to
be reversed for the country to continue to play a leadership role in particle
physics, especially in this most promising era of imminent new discoveries that
could finally break the hugely successful, but limited, Standard Model of
fundamental particle interactions. In this challenging environment it is
essential that the community invest anew in instrumentation and optimize the
use of the available resources to develop new innovative, cost-effective
instrumentation, as this is our best hope to successfully accomplish the
mission of high energy physics. This report summarizes the current status of
instrumentation for high energy physics, the challenges and needs of future
experiments and indicates high priority research areas.

susceptible to physical layer (PHY) spoofing (signal exploitation) attacks
owing to their inability to implement a full-blown protocol stack for security.
The overwhelming adoption of multicarrier techniques such as orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for the PHY layer makes IoT devices
further vulnerable to PHY spoofing attacks. These attacks which aim at
injecting bogus/spurious data into the receiver, involve inferring transmission
parameters and finding PHY characteristics of the transmitted signals so as to
spoof the received signal. Non-contiguous (NC) OFDM systems have been argued to
have low probability of exploitation (LPE) characteristics against classic
attacks based on cyclostationary analysis, and the corresponding PHY has been
deemed to be secure. However, with the advent of machine learning (ML)
algorithms, adversaries can devise data-driven attacks to compromise such
systems. It is in this vein that PHY spoofing performance of adversaries
equipped with supervised and unsupervised ML tools are investigated in this
paper. The supervised ML approach is based on deep neural networks (DNN) while
the unsupervised one employs variational autoencoders (VAEs). In particular,
VAEs are shown to be capable of learning representations from NC-OFDM signals
related to their PHY characteristics such as frequency pattern and modulation
scheme, which are useful for PHY spoofing. In addition, a new metric based on
the disentanglement principle is proposed to measure the quality of such
learned representations. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of
the spoofing adversaries highly depends on the subcarriers' allocation
patterns. Particularly, it is shown that utilizing a random subcarrier
occupancy pattern secures NC-OFDM systems against ML-based attacks.

many engineering and scientific computing problems such as circuit simulation.
But parallelizing LU factorization with the Graphic Processing Units (GPU)
still remains a challenging problem due to high data dependency and irregular
memory accesses. Recently GPU-based hybrid right-looking sparse LU solver,
called GLU (1.0 and 2.0), has been proposed to exploit the fine grain level
parallelism of GPU. However, a new type of data dependency (called double-U
dependency) introduced by GLU slows down the preprocessing step. Furthermore,
GLU uses fixed GPU thread allocation strategy, which limits the parallelism. In
this article, we propose a new GPU-based sparse LU factorization method, called
{\it GLU3.0}, which solves the aforementioned problems. First, it introduces a
much more efficient data dependency detection algorithm. Second, we observe
that the potential parallelism is different as the matrix factorization goes
on. We then develop three different modes of GPU kernel which adapt to
different stages to accommodate the computing task changes in the
factorization. Experimental results on circuit matrices from University of
Florida Sparse Matrix Collection (UFL) show that GLU3.0 delivers 2-3 orders of
magnitude speedup over GLU2.0 for the data dependency detection. Furthermore,
GLU3.0 achieve 13.0 $\times$ (arithmetic mean) or 6.7$\times$ (geometric mean)
speedup over GLU2.0 and 7.1$\times$ (arithmetic mean) or 4.8 $\times$

biaxial strain dependence of electronic structures and transport properties of
Janus PtSSe monolayer is systematically investigated by using generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Calculated results
show that SOC has a detrimental effect on power factor of PtSSe monolayer,
which can be understood by considering SOC effects on energy bands near the
Fermi level. With $a/a_0$ from 0.94 to 1.06, the energy band gap firstly
increases, and then decreases, which is due to the position change of
conduction band minimum (CBM). It is found that compressive strain can increase
the strength of conduction bands convergence by changing relative position of
conduction band extrema (CBE), which can enhance n-type $ZT_e$ values.
Calculated results show that compressive strain can also induce the flat
valence bands around the $\Gamma$ point near the Fermi level, which can lead to
high Seebeck coefficient due to large effective masses, giving rise to better
p-type $ZT_e$ values. The calculated elastic constants with $a/a_0$ from 0.94
to 1.06 all satisfy the mechanical stability criteria, which proves that the
PtSSe monolayer is mechanically stable in the considered strain range. Our
works further enrich studies of Janus TMD monolayers, and can motivate farther

optimization problems. Ising computing essentially tries to solve the quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is also described by the Ising

computers. In this work, we propose a novel General Purpose Graphics Processing
Unit (GPGPU) solver for the balanced min-cut graph partitioning problem, which
has many applications in the area of design automation and others. Ising model
solvers for the balanced min-cut partitioning problem have been proposed in the
past. However, they have rarely been demonstrated in existing quantum computers
for many meaningful problem sizes. One difficulty is the fact that the
balancing constraint in the balanced min-cut problem can result in a complete
graph in the Ising model, which makes each local update a global update. Such
global update from each GPU thread will diminish the efficiency of GPU
computing, which favors many localized memory accesses for each thread. To
mitigate this problem, we propose an novel Global Decoupled Ising (GDI) model
and the corresponding annealing algorithm, in which the local update is still
preserved to maintain the efficiency. As a result, the new Ising solver
essentially eliminates the need for the fully connected graph and will use a
more efficient method to track and update global balance without sacrificing
cut quality. Experimental results show that the proposed Ising-based min-cut
partitioning method outperforms the state of art partitioning tool, METIS, on
G-set graph benchmarks in terms of partitioning quality with similar CPU/GPU

has many applications such as image restoration and object removal. However,
current GAN-based generative inpainting models do not explicitly exploit the
structural or textural consistency between restored contents and their
surrounding contexts.To address this limitation, we propose to enforce the
alignment (or closeness) between the local data submanifolds (or subspaces)
around restored images and those around the original (uncorrupted) images
during the learning process of GAN-based inpainting models. We exploit Local
Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to measure, in deep feature space, the alignment
between data submanifolds learned by a GAN model and those of the original
data, from a perspective of both images (denoted as iLID) and local patches
(denoted as pLID) of images. We then apply iLID and pLID as regularizations for
GAN-based inpainting models to encourage two levels of submanifold alignment:
1) an image-level alignment for improving structural consistency, and 2) a
patch-level alignment for improving textural details. Experimental results on
four benchmark datasets show that our proposed model can generate more accurate
results than state-of-the-art models.

relativistic account of the Bell correlations has gained increasing recognition
in recent years. It is not known, however, the extent to which these models can
make use of their relativistic properties to account for relativistic effects
on entangled systems. We consider here a hypothetical relativistic Bell
experiment, where one of the wings experiences time-dilation effects. We show
that the retrocausal Brans model (Found. Phys, 49(2), 2019) can be easily
generalised to analyse this experiment, and that it predicts less separation of
eigenpackets in the wing experiencing the time-dilation. This causes the
particle distribution patterns on the photographic plates to differ between the
wings -- an experimentally testable prediction of the model. We discuss the
difficulties faced by other hidden variable models in describing this
experiment, and their natural resolution in our model due to its relativistic
properties. In particular, we discuss how a $\psi$-epistemic interpretation may
resolve several difficulties encountered in relativistic generalisations of de
Broglie-Bohm theory and objective state reduction models. Lastly, we argue that
it is not clear at present, due to technical difficulties, if our prediction is
reproduced by quantum field theory. We conclude that if it is, then the
retrocausal Brans model predicts the same result with great simplicity in
comparison. If not, the model can be experimentally tested.

average. From this data, many people might confidently state that a

reasoning error, because correlation does not necessarily indicate causation --
X and Y can be correlated without one directly causing the other. While this
error is pervasive, its prevalence might be amplified or mitigated by the way
that the data is presented to a viewer. Across three crowdsourced experiments,
we examined whether how simple data relations are presented would mitigate this
reasoning error. The first experiment tested examples similar to the
breakfast-GPA relation, varying in the plausibility of the causal link. We
asked participants to rate their level of agreement that the relation was
correlated, which they rated appropriately as high. However, participants also
expressed high agreement with a causal interpretation of the data. Levels of
support for the causal interpretation were not equally strong across
visualization types: causality ratings were highest for text descriptions and
bar graphs, but weaker for scatter plots. But is this effect driven by bar
graphs aggregating data into two groups or by the visual encoding type? We
isolated data aggregation versus visual encoding type and examined their
individual effect on perceived causality. Overall, different visualization
designs afford different cognitive reasoning affordances across the same data.
High levels of data aggregation by graphs tend to be associated with higher
perceived causality in data. Participants perceived line and dot visual
encodings as more causal than bar encodings. Our results demonstrate how some
visualization designs trigger stronger causal links while choosing others can
help mitigate unwarranted perceptions of causality.

variables on the real line and the issue of closures of cumulant expansions is
well elaborated. The case of phase variables significantly differs from the
case of linear ones; the relevant order parameters are the Kuramoto-Daido ones
but not the conventional moments. One can formally introduce `circular'
cumulants for Kuramoto-Daido order parameters, similar to the conventional
cumulants for moments. The circular cumulant expansions allow to advance beyond
the Ott-Antonsen theory and consider populations of real oscillators. First, we
show that truncation of circular cumulant expansions, except for the
Ott-Antonsen case, is forbidden. Second, we compare this situation to the case
of the Gaussian distribution of a linear variable, where the second cumulant is
nonzero and all the higher cumulants are zero, and elucidate why keeping up to
the second cumulant is admissible for a linear variable, but forbidden for
circular cumulants. Third, we discuss the implication of this truncation issue
to populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons [E. Montbri\'o, D.
Paz\'o, A. Roxin, Phys. Rev. X, vol. 5, 021028 (2015)], where within the
framework of macroscopic description, the firing rate diverges for any finite
truncation of the cumulant series, and discuss how one should handle these
situations. Fourth, we consider the cumulant-based low-dimensional reductions
for macroscopic population dynamics in the context of this truncation issue.
These reductions are applicable, where the cumulant series exponentially decay
with the cumulant order, i.e., they form a geometric progression hierarchy.
Fifth, we demonstrate the formation of this hierarchy for generic distributions
on the circle and experimental data for coupled biological and electrochemical
oscillators.

rather than just at the mirror focus as in the standard optics, to capture the
miniature image of objects. In addition, a set of multi-grid masks (or a
modulation collimator) is installed in front of the telescope. We find that the
masks work as a coded aperture camera and that they boost the angular
resolution of the focusing optics. The major advantage of this concept is that
a much better angular resolution an order of 2--3 or more than in the
conventional optics is achievable, while a high throughput (large effective
area) is maintained, which is crucial in photon-limited high-energy astronomy,
because any type of mirrors, including light-weight reflective mirrors, can be
employed in our concept. If the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high, we
estimate that angular resolutions at the diffraction limit of 4"" and 0""4 at
about 7 keV can be achieved with a pair of masks at separations of 1~m and
100~m, respectively, at the diffraction limit.

$f_i$ is the number of occurrences of value $i$ and $g$ is some fixed function.
This includes important statistics such as the number of distinct elements,
frequency moments, and the empirical entropy of the data.
  In the CONGEST model, a simple adaptation from streaming lower bounds shows
that it requires $\tilde{\Omega}(D+ n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of
the graph, to compute some of these statistics exactly. However, these lower
bounds do not hold for graphs that are well-connected. We give an algorithm
that computes $\sum_{i=1}^{N} g(f_i)$ exactly in $\tau_G \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{\log

applications in computing the top $k$ most frequent elements.
  We demonstrate that there is a high similarity between the GOSSIP model and
the CONGEST model in well-connected graphs. In particular, we show that each
round of the GOSSIP model can be simulated almost-perfectly in
$\tilde{O}(\tau_G $ rounds of the CONGEST model. To this end, we develop a new

generalized-gradient-corrected (GGA), GGA including on-site coulomb repulsion
(U) corrected spin polarized calculations based on accurate density functional
theory. Our total energy calculations show that PbTi1-xVxO3 stabilizes in
C-type antiferromagnetic ground state for x>0.123. With the substitution of V
into PbTiO3, the tetragonal distortion is highly enhanced accompanied by a
linear increase in polarization. In addition, our band structure analysis shows
that for lower x values, the tendency to form 2Dmagnetism of PbTi1-xVxO3
decreases. A non-magnetic metallic ground state is observed for the
paraelectric phase for V concentration (x) = 1 competing with a volume change
of 10% showing a large magnetovolume effect. Our orbital projected DOS as well
as orbital ordering analysis suggest that the orbital ordering plays a major
role in the magnetic to non-magnetic transition when going from ferroelectric
to paraelectric phase. The calculated magnetic anisotropic energy shows that
the direction [110] is the easy axis of magnetization for x= 1 composition. The
present study adds a new series of compounds to the magnetoelectric family with
rarely existing giant coupling between electric and magnetic order parameters.
These results show that such kind of materials can be used for novel practical
applications where one can change the magnetic properties drastically (magnetic
to non-magnetic as shown here) with external electric fieldand vice-versa.

a noncommutative bootstrap method and establish a general criterion of maximal

Based on this criterion, we prove that for any countable discrete amenable

  Alignment and Cancellation in Gaussian Interference Multiple Access Channel","10 pages",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A combined technique of interference alignment (IA) and interference
cancellation (IC), known as interference alignment and cancellation (IAC)
scheme, has been proposed to improve the total achievable degrees of freedom
(DoFs) over IA. Since it is NP-hard to solve the transceiver under a given
tuple of DoFs or to maximize the total achievable DoFs in the general system
configuration by IA (or IAC), the optimal transceiver cannot be obtained in
polynomial time. Meanwhile, it has been known that a closed-form yet suboptimal
transceiver can be designed for IAC by employing a symbol-to-symbol (STS)
alignment structure. As its performance has not been known yet, we aim to
derive the total DoFs that can be achieved by such suboptimal but closed-form
IAC transceivers for Gaussian interference multiple access channels with K
receivers and J users (transmitters), each with M antennas. Our analysis shows
that the closed-form IAC transceivers under consideration can achieve a maximum
total achievable DoFs of 2M, which turns out to be larger than those achieved
in classical IA, e.g., 2MK/(K+1) DoFs by a specific configuration where each
link has the same target DoFs. Moreover, considering the NP-hardness of
deriving the maximum total achievable DoFs with the optimal IAC transceiver,
its upper bound has been derived for comparison with the results of our
closed-form IAC transceiver. Numerical results illustrate that its performance
can be guaranteed within 20% of the upper bound when the number of multiple
access channels are relatively small, e.g., K <=4.

a paragraph) that describes the visual content of an image. The problem
nevertheless is not trivial especially when there are multiple descriptive and
diverse gists to be considered for paragraph generation, which often happens in
real images. A valid question is how to encapsulate such gists/topics that are
worthy of mention from an image, and then describe the image from one topic to
another but holistically with a coherent structure. In this paper, we present a
new design --- Convolutional Auto-Encoding (CAE) that purely employs
convolutional and deconvolutional auto-encoding framework for topic modeling on
the region-level features of an image. Furthermore, we propose an architecture,
namely CAE plus Long Short-Term Memory (dubbed as CAE-LSTM), that novelly
integrates the learnt topics in support of paragraph generation. Technically,
CAE-LSTM capitalizes on a two-level LSTM-based paragraph generation framework
with attention mechanism. The paragraph-level LSTM captures the inter-sentence
dependency in a paragraph, while sentence-level LSTM is to generate one
sentence which is conditioned on each learnt topic. Extensive experiments are
conducted on Stanford image paragraph dataset, and superior results are
reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably,
CAE-LSTM increases CIDEr performance from 20.93% to 25.15%.

spatio-temporal dynamics of RBC suspensions flowing through a typical
microchannel at low Reynolds number. Through experiments with dilute RBC
suspensions, we find an off-centre two-peak (OCTP) profile of cells contrary to
the centralised distribution commonly reported for low-inertia flows. This is
reminiscent of the well-known ""tubular pinch effect"" which arises from inertial
effects. However, given the conditions of negligible inertia in our
experiments, an alternative explanation is needed for this OCTP profile. Our
massively-parallel simulations of RBC flow in real-size microfluidic dimensions
using the immersed-boundary-lattice-Boltzmann method (IB-LBM) confirm the
experimental findings and elucidate the underlying mechanism for the
counterintuitive RBC pattern. By analysing the RBC migration and cell-free
layer (CFL) development within a high-aspect-ratio channel, we show that such a
distribution is co-determined by the spatial decay of hydrodynamic lift and the
global deficiency of cell dispersion in dilute suspensions. We find a CFL
development length greater than 46 and 28 hydraulic diameters in the experiment
and simulation, respectively, exceeding typical lengths of microfluidic
designs. Our work highlights the key role of transient cell distribution in
dilute suspensions, which may negatively affect the reliability of experimental

of the ratio of the counter-rotating oscillators, which was otherwise realized
only by increasing the number of inactive oscillators to a large extent. The
effect of the mean-field feedback strength in the symmetry preserving coupling
is also explored. The parameter space of aging transition was increased
abruptly even for a feeble decrease in the feedback strength and subsequently,
the aging transition was observed at a critical value of the feedback strength
surprisingly without any counter-rotating oscillators. Further, the study was
extended to symmetry breaking coupling using conjugate variables and it was
observed that the symmetry breaking coupling can facilitating the onset of
aging transition even in the absence of counter-rotating oscillators and for
the unit value of the feedback strength. In general, the parameter space of
aging transition was found to increase by increasing the frequency of

oscillators in both the symmetry preserving and symmetry breaking couplings.
Further, the transition from oscillatory to aging transition occurs via a Hopf
bifurcation, while the transition from aging transition to oscillation death
state emerges via Pitchfork bifurcation. Analytical expressions for the
critical ratio of the counter- rotating oscillators are deduced to find the
stable boundaries of the aging transition.

are often used for modeling various kinds of objects such as images, molecules,

for labeled graphs has to be defined. A widely used measure is the graph edit
distance (GED), which, intuitively, is defined as the minimum amount of
distortion that has to be applied to a source graph in order to transform it
into a target graph. The main advantage of GED is its flexibility and
sensitivity to small differences between the input graphs. Its main drawback is
that it is hard to compute.
  In this thesis, new results and techniques for several aspects of computing
GED are presented. Firstly, theoretical aspects are discussed: competing
definitions of GED are harmonized, the problem of computing GED is
characterized in terms of complexity, and several reductions from GED to the
quadratic assignment problem (QAP) are presented. Secondly, solvers for the
linear sum assignment problem with error-correction (LSAPE) are discussed.
LSAPE is a generalization of the well-known linear sum assignment problem
(LSAP), and has to be solved as a subproblem by many GED algorithms. In
particular, a new solver is presented that efficiently reduces LSAPE to LSAP.
Thirdly, exact algorithms for computing GED are presented in a systematic way,
and improvements of existing algorithms as well as a new mixed integer
programming (MIP) based approach are introduced. Fourthly, a detailed overview
of heuristic algorithms that approximate GED via upper and lower bounds is
provided, and eight new heuristics are described. Finally, a new easily

the Orion Bar photon-dominated region (PDR), based on observations of two
optically thin $\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}$ lines which were analyzed by using a
single-slab large velocity gradient model. The corresponding spin temperature
does not coincide with the kinetic temperature of the molecular gas in this
UV-illuminated region. This was interpreted as an indication of water molecules
being formed on cold icy grains which were subsequently released by UV
photodesorption. A more complete set of water observations in the Orion Bar,
including seven $\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}$ lines and one $\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}$ line,
carried out using Herschel/HIFI instrument, was reanalyzed using the Meudon PDR
code to derive gas-phase water abundance and the OPR, taking into account the
steep density and temperature gradients present in the region. The model line
intensities are in good agreement with the observations assuming that water
molecules formed with an OPR corresponding to thermal equilibrium conditions at
the local kinetic temperature of the gas and when solely considering gas-phase
chemistry and water gas-grain exchanges through adsorption and desorption.
Gas-phase water is predicted to arise from a region deep into the cloud,
corresponding to a visual extinction of $A_{\mathrm{V}} \sim 9$, with a
$\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}$ fractional abundance of $\sim 2\times 10^{-7}$ and column
density of $(1.4 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for a total cloud depth of
$A_{\mathrm{V}}=15$. A line-of-sight average ortho-to-para ratio of $2.8 \pm
0.2$ is derived. The observational data are consistent with a nuclear spin
isomer repartition corresponding to the thermal equilibrium at a temperature of
$36 \pm 2$ K, much higher than the spin temperature previously reported for
this region and close to the gas kinetic temperature in the water-emitting gas.

In this paper, we find out that the AMPM condition can also be used to design
the exact quantum search algorithm in the case of known $\lambda$, and the
minimum number of iterations reaches the optimal level of existing exact
algorithms. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the proposed algorithm on
IBM's quantum computer. In addition, we theoretically find two coincidental
phases with equal absolute value in our algorithm based on the AMPM condition
and that algorithm based on single-phase matching. Our work confirms the
practicability of the AMPM condition in the case of known $\lambda$, and is
helpful to understand the mechanism of this condition.

first elucidate what are the non-equilibrium manifestations of the phenomenon

computing approximate non-adiabatic coupling vectors (NACVs) between the ground
and excited electronic states are presented. The first approximation makes use
of Mulliken transition charges, while the second is based on derivative
coupling vectors between localized molecular orbitals. Both approximations lend
themselves easily to implementation within a whole spectrum of semiempirical
quantum-chemical semiempirical methods. Here we present the implementation
within the tight-binding DFT and benchmark its performance against analytical
TD-DFT NAC vectors for a range of planar fluorescent chromophores at the
Franck-Condon point. The pattern of the atomic NAC vectors is often reproduced,
but the relative magnitude and total length of the NAC vector are often in
serious error. Although quantitative predictions are not possible, these simple
and intuitive approximations allow to explain, in a qualitative way, trends in
the electronic coupling in extended molecular systems and complex materials. In
this context, we investigate how the non-adiabatic coupling depends on the
delocalization length of an excitation in chromophoric oligomers based on a
simple model. Finally, we make general qualitative predictions on the size
dependence of the fluorescence quantum yields in extended molecular systems,
and illustrate those on the example of triply fused porphyrin tapes with
increasing length.

energy perspective, the highly magnetic rotating white dwarf can accelerate
particles to TeV energies. In this study, a search for high energy gamma-ray
emission was conducted between 100 MeV - 500 GeV by analysing the newly
available Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data with the new Fermi 1.0.1 Science Tools. Binned
likelihood analysis was done using power law, broken power law and log parabola
models. From the selected Region of Interest (ROI) centred on AR Sco's

Basu","Modeling Tumor Angiogenesis with Cellular Automata","the article is incomplete and it required major revision",,,,"q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from the existing vessels.
During tumour angiogenesis, tumour cells secret a number of chemical substrates
called tumour angiogenic factors (TAFs). These factors diffuse through the
extracellular matrix (ECM) and degrade the basement membrane of nearby
vasculature. The TAFs also disrupt the corresponding endothelial cell receptors
and form finger like capillary sprouts. These factors also create a chemical
gradient (chemotaxis) between the tumour and the surrounding blood vessels. Due
to the chemotactic force, the capillary sprouts migrate towards the tumour. On
the other hand, a haptotactic force generated due to fibronectin which is
secreted by the endothelial cell, also acts on these sprouts. These sprouts
grow through the proliferation of recruited endothelial cells from the parent
vessels. Tumour angiogenesis is not fully understood yet. In this paper, we use
2-D cellular automata (CA) model to study the behavior of tumour angiogenesis
using both Moore and von-Neumann neighborhood. The CA model also mimics
capillary sprout branching and the fusion of two adjacent sprout tips
(anastomoses). In this simulation, a couple of important points are noted: a)
no two capillary sprouts are generated from adjacent locations; b) as the
sprouts approach closer to the tumour, its branching tendency increases; c)
chemotaxis is the most effective driving force for angiogenesis.

seen successes in past years and have recently been extended into methods that
personalize the dialogue, e.g. take the personal context of users into account.
These works, however, are limited to personalization to a single user with whom
they require multiple interactions and do not generalize the usage of context
across users. This work introduces a problem where a generalized usage of
context is relevant and proposes two Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based
approaches to this problem. The first approach uses a single learner and
extends the traditional POMDP formulation of dialogue state with features that
describe the user context. The second approach segments users by context and
then employs a learner per context. We compare these approaches in a benchmark
of existing non-RL and RL-based methods in three established and one novel
application domain of financial product recommendation. We compare the
influence of context and training experiences on performance and find that
learning approaches generally outperform a handcrafted gold standard.

that, whenever a variety of Heyting algebras has finite depth, then it has
surjective epimorphisms. In contrast, we show that for every integer n greater

non-surjective epimorphism. Within the so-called Kuznetsov-Gerciu variety

settle natural questions about Beth-style definability for a range of

  Networks-on-Chip","23 pages, 17 figures",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fault-tolerant routing (FTR) in Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) has become a common
practice to sustain the performance of multi-core systems with an increasing
number of faults on a chip. On the other hand, usage of third-party
intellectual property blocks has made security a primary concern in modern day
designs. This article presents a mechanism to mitigate a denial-of-service
attack, namely packet drop attack, which may arise due to the hardware Trojans
(HTs) in NoCs that adopt FTR algorithms. HTs, associated with external kill
switches, are conditionally triggered to enable the attack scenario. Security
modules, such as authentication unit, buffer shuffler, and control unit, have
been proposed to thwart the attack in runtime and restore secure packet flow in
the NoC. These units work together as a shield to safeguard the packets from
proceeding towards the output ports with faulty links. Synthesis results show
that the proposed secure FT router, when compared with a baseline FT router,
has area and power overheads of at most 4.04% and 0.90%, respectively.
Performance evaluation shows that SeFaR has acceptable overheads in the
execution time, energy consumption, average packet latency, and power-latency
product metrics when compared with a baseline FT router while running real
benchmarks, as well as synthetic traffic. Further, a possible design of a
comprehensive secure router has been presented with a view to addressing and
mitigating multiple attacks that can arise in the NoC routers.

Relativity (ISiTGR) which is a patch to the software CAMB and CosmoMC. ISiTGR
is intended to test deviations from GR at cosmological scales using
cosmological data sets. While doing so, it allows for various extensions to the
standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model. In this new release, we have support for the
following: 1) dynamical dark energy parametrizations with a constant or
time-dependent equation of state; 2) a consistent implementation of anisotropic
shear to model massive neutrinos throughout the full formalism; 3) multiple
commonly-used parametrizations of modified growth (MG) parameters; 4)
functional, binned and hybrid time- and scale-dependencies for all MG
parameters; 5) spatially flat or curved backgrounds. ISiTGR is designed to
allow cosmological analyses to take full advantage of ongoing and future
surveys to test simultaneously or separately various extensions to the standard
model. We describe here the formalism and its implementation in the CMB code,
the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and the 3x2 point statistics. Next, we
apply ISiTGR to current data sets from Planck-2018, Planck-2015, Dark Energy
Survey YR1 release, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Redshift Space
Distortions (BAO/RSD) from the BOSS Data Release 12, the 6DF Galaxy Survey and
the SDSS Data Release 7 Main Galaxy Sample, and Supernova from the Pantheon
compilation, joint SNLS/SDSS data analysis and the Hubble Space Telescope. We
derive constraints on MG parameters for various combinations of the five
features above and find that GR is consistent with current data sets in all
cases. The code is made publicly available at

learning, as a powerful machine learning technology, has shown great advantages

a computationally-hungry method, and requires high costs (e.g., time, energy

crisis and incurs a substantial burden to the environment. As a consequence,
the deep learning methods are difficult to be popularized and applied in the

model based on convolutional neural network, namely LoadCNN, for next-day load
forecasting of individual resident with reduced training cost. The experiments
show that the training time of LoadCNN is only approximately 1/54 of the one of

only approximate 1/45 of those of other state-of-the-art models based on the
same indicators. Meanwhile, the prediction accuracy of our model is equal to
that of current state-of-the-art models, making LoadCNN the first load

structural and dynamical quantities at the interface are obtained by computer
simulations. Water molecules are found to get exchanged between the ice-like
and water-like domains of the interface with a time scale of the order of ~10
ps. To investigate the effect of interfaces in general, we study three other
systems, namely (i) water between two hydrophobic nano-slabs, (ii) water at
protein and (iii) DNA surfaces. In all these systems, we find that the
difference from bulk properties become negligible beyond ~1 nm, with structural
features converging to bulk values faster than the dynamical properties. Even
in the case of the latter, we find that single-particle and collective
properties behave differently. The approach to bulk values is rapid except for
collective shell-dipole moments. We present a new insightful characterization

tetrahedrality order parameter (q_td) and dynamics by diffusion (D) and angular

The relative localization problem consists of estimating the relative pose

discrete data without taking into account the chronological order of the

distribution of an undirected network using sampled data. Although power-law
degree distributions are ubiquitous in nature, the widely used parametric
methods for estimating them (e.g. linear regression on double-logarithmic axes,
maximum likelihood estimation with uniformly sampled nodes) suffer from the
large variance introduced by the lack of data-points from the tail portion of
the power-law degree distribution. As a solution, we present a novel maximum
likelihood estimation approach that exploits the friendship paradox to sample
more efficiently from the tail of the degree distribution. We analytically show
that the proposed method results in a smaller bias, variance and a Cramer-Rao
lower bound compared to the vanilla maximum-likelihood estimate obtained with
uniformly sampled nodes (which is the most commonly used method in literature).
Detailed numerical and empirical results are presented to illustrate the
performance of the proposed method under different conditions and how it
compares with alternative methods. We also show that the proposed method and
its desirable properties (i.e. smaller bias, variance and Cramer-Rao lower
bound compared to vanilla method based on uniform samples) extend to parametric
degree distributions other than the power-law such as exponential degree
distributions as well. All the numerical and empirical results are reproducible

probing their local cellular environment under the effect of diffusion.
Diffusion-weighted NMR spectroscopy therefore presents unparalleled potential
to yield cell-type specific microstructural information. Double diffusion
encoding (DDE) relies on two diffusion blocks which relative directions
describe a varying angle during the course of the experiment. Unlike single
diffusion encoding, DDE measurements at long mixing time display some angular
modulation of the signal amplitude which reflects compartment shape anisotropy,
while requiring relatively low gradient strength. This angular dependence has
been formerly used to quantify cell fiber diameter using a model of
isotropically oriented infinite cylinders. However, it has been little explored
how additional features of the cell microstructure, such as cell body diameter,
fiber length and branching may also influence the DDE signal. Here, we used a
cryoprobe as well as state-of-the-art post-processing to perform DDE
acquisitions with high accuracy and precision in the mouse brain at 11.7 T. We
then compared our results to simulated DDE datasets obtained in various 3D cell
models in order to pinpoint which features of cell morphology may influence the
most the angular dependence of the DDE signal. While the infinite cylinder
model poorly fits our experimental data, we show that incorporating branched
fiber structure in our model is paramount to sensibly interpret the DDE signal.
Lastly, experiments and simulations in the short mixing time regime suggest
that some sensitivity to cell body diameter might be retrieved, although
additional experiments would be required to further support this statement.

a crossover from the $\pi$-state to the blurred $\pi$-state and then a
continuous transition to the incoherent state by increasing the fraction of

we found that for all the values of the fraction of inhibitors, the two groups
remain in-phase, and the transition point of fully synchronized to incoherent
state reduced by strengthening the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory links. In
the SW networks, we found that the order parameters for both models have not
monotonic behavior in terms of the fraction of contrarians and inhibitors. Up
to the optimal fraction of contrarians inhibitors, the synchronization rises by
introducing the contrarians and inhibitors and then falls. We discuss that this

bolometric light curves with a shallow power law time dependence, in good
agreement with those observed in tidal disruption events. A self-similar model
based on electron scattering opacity, for example, yields a power law index of
$-11/14$, as opposed to $-19/16$ for the case of zero ISCO stress. These
solutions correspond to an extended period of relaxation of the evolving disc
which, like the light curves they produce, is not sustainable indefinitely.
Cumulative departures from the approximation of exact circular orbits cause the
power law index to evolve slowly with time, leading eventually to the steeper
fall-off associated with traditional zero ISCO stress models. These modified
solutions are discussed in detail in a companion paper.

the feasibility of the proposed approach and to provide the defenders with
various ways to choose optimal deployments of defense mechanisms for the IoT.
We compare the GA with the exhaustive search algorithm (ESA) in terms of the
runtime complexity and performance accuracy in optimality. Our results show
that the GA is much more efficient in computing a good spread of the
deployments than the ESA, in proportion to the increase of the IoT devices.

a novel estimator to estimate this variance using the Influence Function (IF)
approach that had been used previously very successfully to estimate the
variance of the bootstrap-based estimators. The motivation for this research is
that, as the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks a rigorous method for
estimating the variance of the CV-based estimators. What is available is a set
of ad-hoc procedures that have no mathematical foundation since they ignore the
covariance structure among dependent random variables. The conducted
experiments show that the IF proposed method has small RMS error with some
bias. However, surprisingly, the ad-hoc methods still work better than the
IF-based method. Unfortunately, this is due to the lack of enough smoothness if
compared to the bootstrap estimator. This opens the research for three points:
(1) more comprehensive simulation study to clarify when the IF method win or
loose; (2) more mathematical analysis to figure out why the ad-hoc methods work
well; and (3) more mathematical treatment to figure out the connection between
the appropriate amount of ""smoothness"" and decreasing the bias of the IF
method.

intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been developed to identify and react to
them for protecting a system. However, the core idea of an IDS is a reactive
mechanism in nature even though it detects intrusions which have already been
in the system. Hence, the reactive mechanisms would be way behind and not
effective for the actions taken by agile and smart attackers. Due to the
inherent limitation of an IDS with the reactive nature, intrusion prevention
systems (IPSs) have been developed to thwart potential attackers and/or
mitigate the impact of the intrusions before they penetrate into the system. In
this chapter, we introduce an integrated defense mechanism to achieve intrusion
prevention in a software-defined Internet-of-Things (IoT) network by leveraging
the technologies of cyberdeception (i.e., a decoy system) and moving target
defense, namely MTD (i.e., network topology shuffling). In addition, we
validate their effectiveness and efficiency based on the devised graphical
security model (GSM)-based evaluation framework. To develop an adaptive,
proactive intrusion prevention mechanism, we employed fitness functions based
on the genetic algorithm in order to identify an optimal network topology where
a network topology can be shuffled based on the detected level of the system
vulnerability. Our simulation results show that GA-based shuffling schemes
outperform random shuffling schemes in terms of the number of attack paths
toward decoy targets. In addition, we observe that there exists a tradeoff
between the system lifetime (i.e., mean time to security failure) and the
defense cost introduced by the proposed MTD technique for fixed and adaptive
shuffling schemes. That is, a fixed GA-based shuffling can achieve higher MTTSF
with more cost while an adaptive GA-based shuffling obtains less MTTSF with
less cost.

detection. In order to detect the objects in various sizes, the object
detectors often exploit the hierarchy of the multi-scale feature maps called
feature pyramid, which is readily obtained by the CNN architecture. However,
the performance of these object detectors is limited since the bottom-level
feature maps, which experience fewer convolutional layers, lack the semantic
information needed to capture the characteristics of the small objects. In
order to address such problem, various methods have been proposed to increase
the depth for the bottom-level features used for object detection. While most
approaches are based on the generation of additional features through the
top-down pathway with lateral connections, our approach directly fuses
multi-scale feature maps using bidirectional long short term memory (biLSTM) in
effort to generate deeply fused semantics. Then, the resulting semantic
information is redistributed to the individual pyramidal feature at each scale
through the channel-wise attention model. We integrate our semantic combining
and attentive redistribution feature network (ScarfNet) with baseline object
detectors, i.e., Faster R-CNN, single-shot multibox detector (SSD) and
RetinaNet. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the existing
feature pyramid methods as well as the baseline detectors and achieve the state

convergence rate previously known from the discrete setting. This quantitative
convergence analysis is closely connected to the~$J$-method's unique feature of
sensitivity with respect to spectral shifts. Contrary to classical gradient
flows, this allows both the selective approximation of excited states as well

Rayleigh quotient iteration for linear eigenvalue problems. These advantageous
convergence properties are demonstrated in a series of numerical experiments

intriguing phenomena such as emergent triplet superconductivity at their
interfaces and the appearance of in-gap, spin polarized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR)
states bound to magnetic impurities on a superconducting surface. In this work
we demonstrate that similar phenomena can be induced on a surface of a
conventional superconductor by chemisorbing non-magnetic chiral molecules.
Conductance spectra measured on NbSe2 flakes over which chiral alpha helix
polyalanine molecules were adsorbed, exhibit, in some cases, in-gap states
nearly symmetrically positioned around zero bias that shift with magnetic
field, akin to YSR states, as corroborated by theoretical simulations. Other
samples show evidence for a collective phenomenon of hybridized YSR-like states
giving rise to unconventional, possibly triplet superconductivity, manifested
in the conductance spectra by the appearance of a zero bias conductance that
diminishes, but does not split, with magnetic field. The transition between
these two scenarios appears to be governed by the density of adsorbed
molecules.

  rotational evolution of solar-like stars","9 pages, 7 figures, 1 table. Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201936384",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solar-like stars (M < 1.3 Msun) lose angular momentum through their
magnetized winds. The resulting evolution of the surface rotation period, which
can be directly measured photometrically, has the potential to provide an
accurate indicator of stellar age, and is constrained by observations of
rotation periods of coeval stars, such as members of Galactic open clusters. A
prominent observational feature of the mass-rotation period diagrams of open
clusters is a sequence of relatively slower rotators. The formation and
persistence of this slow rotators sequence across several billion years imply
an approximately coherent spin-down of the stars that belong to it. In
particular, the sequence is observed to evolve coherently towards longer
periods in progressively older clusters. Recent observations of the 700-Myr old
Praesepe and the 1-Gyr old NGC 6811 clusters, however, seem to contradict this
general pattern. While the 1 Msun stars on the slow rotators sequence of the
older NGC 6811 have longer periods than their counterparts in the younger
Praesepe, as expected, the two sequences essentially merge at lower masses (<
0.8 Msun). In other words, low-mass stars seem to have not been spinning down
at all in the intervening 300 Myr. Here we show that this behavior is a
manifestation of the variable rotational coupling in solar-like stars. The
resurfacing of angular momentum from the interior can temporarily compensate
for the loss due to wind braking at the surface. The internal redistribution of
angular momentum has a steep mass dependence; as a result, the re-coupling
occurs at different ages for stars of different masses. Our model explains the
stalled surface spin-down of low-mass stars between Praesepe and NGC 6811, and
predicts that the same behavior should be observable at other ages in other
mass ranges.

$\mathbb{R}^2$ of intensity $\lambda$. In the homogenous RCM, the vertices at
$x,y$ are connected with probability $g(|x-y|)$, independent of everything
else, where $g:[0,\infty) \to [0,1]$ and $| \cdot |$ is the Euclidean norm. In
the inhomogenous version of the model, points of $\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}$ are
endowed with weights that are non-negative independent random variables with
distribution $P(W>w)= w^{-\beta}1_{[1,\infty)}(w)$, $\beta>0$. Vertices located
at $x,y$ with weights $W_x,W_y$ are connected with probability $1 - \exp\left(

straight line segments starting and ending at points of
$\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}$. A path in the graph is a continuous curve that is a
subset of the union of all these line segments. The Poisson stick model
consists of line segments of independent random lengths and orientation with
the mid point of each segment located at a distinct point of
$\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}$. Intersecting lines form a path in the graph. A graph
is said to percolate if there is an infinite connected component or path. We
derive conditions for the existence of a phase transition and show that there
is no percolation at criticality.

In this work, we propose a new \emph{global} similarity metric, termed as
\emph{central similarity}, with which the hash codes of similar data pairs are
encouraged to approach a common center and those for dissimilar pairs to
converge to different centers, to improve hash learning efficiency and
retrieval accuracy. We principally formulate the computation of the proposed
central similarity metric by introducing a new concept, i.e., \emph{hash
center} that refers to a set of data points scattered in the Hamming space with
a sufficient mutual distance between each other. We then provide an efficient
method to construct well separated hash centers by leveraging the Hadamard
matrix and Bernoulli distributions. Finally, we propose the Central Similarity
Quantization (CSQ) that optimizes the central similarity between data points
w.r.t.\ their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. CSQ is
generic and applicable to both image and video hashing scenarios. Extensive
experiments on large-scale image and video retrieval tasks demonstrate that CSQ
can generate cohesive hash codes for similar data pairs and dispersed hash
codes for dissimilar pairs, achieving a noticeable boost in retrieval

especially suitable for expensive cost functions. Among the main parts of a BO
algorithm, the acquisition function is of fundamental importance, since it
guides the optimization algorithm by translating the uncertainty of the
regression model in a utility measure for each point to be evaluated.
Considering such aspect, selection and design of acquisition functions are one
of the most popular research topics in BO. Since no single acquisition function
was proved to have better performance in all tasks, a well-established approach
consists of selecting different acquisition functions along the iterations of a
BO execution. In such an approach, the GP-Hedge algorithm is a widely used
option given its simplicity and good performance. Despite its success in
various applications, GP-Hedge shows an undesirable characteristic of
accounting on all past performance measures of each acquisition function to
select the next function to be used. In this case, good or bad values obtained
in an initial iteration may impact the choice of the acquisition function for
the rest of the algorithm. This fact may induce a dominant behavior of an

overcome such limitation, in this work we propose a variant of GP-Hedge, named
No-PASt-BO, that reduce the influence of far past evaluations. Moreover, our
method presents a built-in normalization that avoids the functions in the

obtained results on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks indicate
that No-PASt-BO presents competitive performance and always outperforms
GP-Hedge.

over billions of years. These stars, which are supported by electron degeneracy
pressure, reach densities of 1e7 grams per cubic centimetre in their cores. It
has been predicted that a first-order phase transition occurs during
white-dwarf cooling, leading to the crystallization of the non-degenerate
carbon and oxygen ions in the core, which releases a considerable amount of
latent heat and delays the cooling process by about one billion years. However,
no direct observational evidence of this effect has been reported so far. Here
we report the presence of a pile-up in the cooling sequence of evolving white
dwarfs within 100 parsecs of the Sun, determined using photometry and parallax
data from the Gaia satellite. Using modelling, we infer that this pile-up
arises from the release of latent heat as the cores of the white dwarfs
crystallize. In addition to the release of latent heat, we find strong evidence
that cooling is further slowed by the liberation of gravitational energy from
element sedimentation in the crystallizing cores. Our results describe the
energy released by crystallization in strongly coupled Coulomb plasmas, and the
measured cooling delays could help to improve the accuracy of methods used to
determine the age of stellar populations from white dwarfs.

superstructure peaks can then be interpreted as a second-harmonic orbital
signal. Surprisingly, the intensities of the first- and second-harmonic orbital

re-ordering may be driven by an exchange mechanism, that becomes dominant over
the Jahn-Teller instability at low temperature.

from large-eddy simulations (LES) are used to simulate ambient turbulence near
the ground. Load calculations and flight trajectory predictions are conducted
for a flexible high-aspect ratio aircraft, using a fully coupled nonlinear
flight dynamics/aeroelastic model, when it operates in background atmospheric
turbulence generated by the aforementioned models. Comparison of load envelopes
and spectral content, on vehicles of varying flexibility, shows strong
dependency between the selected turbulence model and aircraft aeroelastic
response (e.g. 58\% difference in the predicted magnitude of the wing root
bending moment between LES and von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n models). This is mainly due
to the presence of large flow structures at low altitudes that have comparable
dimensions to the vehicle, and which despite the relatively small wind speeds
within the Earth boundary layer, result in overall high load events. Results
show that one-dimensional models that do not capture those effects provide
fairly non-conservative load estimates and are unsuitable for very flexible

and its evolution, and to the fundamental plasma processes at work both in it
and beyond it. A comet nucleus emits gas as it is heated by the sunlight. The
gas forms the coma, where it is ionised, becomes a plasma and eventually
interacts with the solar wind. Besides these neutral and ionised gases, the
coma also contains dust grains, released from the comet nucleus. As a cometary
atmosphere develops when the comet travels through the solar system,
large-scale structures, such as the plasma boundaries, develop and disappear,
while at planets such large-scale structures are only accessible in their fully
grown, quasi-steady state. In situ measurements at comets enable us to learn
both how such large-scale structures are formed or reformed and how small-scale
processes in the plasma affect the formation and properties of these large
scale structures. Furthermore, a comet goes through a wide range of parameter
regimes during its life cycle, where either collisional processes, involving
neutrals and charged particles, or collisionless processes are at play, and
might even compete in complicated transitional regimes. Thus a comet presents a
unique opportunity to study this parameter space, from an asteroid-like to a
Mars- and Venus-like interaction. Fast flybys of comets have made many new
discoveries, setting the stage for a multi-spacecraft mission to accompany a
comet on its journey through the solar system. This white paper reviews the
present-day knowledge of cometary plasmas, discusses the many questions that
remain unanswered, and outlines a multi-spacecraft ESA mission to accompany a
comet that will answer these questions by combining both multi-spacecraft
observations and a rendezvous mission, and at the same time advance our
understanding of fundamental plasma physics and its role in planetary systems.

occupancy and semantic category of a 3D scene. It helps intelligent devices to
understand and interact with the surrounding scenes. Due to the high-memory
requirement, current methods only produce low-resolution completion
predictions, and generally lose the object details. Furthermore, they also
ignore the multi-scale spatial contexts, which play a vital role for the 3D
inference. To address these issues, in this work we propose a novel deep
learning framework, named Cascaded Context Pyramid Network (CCPNet), to jointly
infer the occupancy and semantic labels of a volumetric 3D scene from a single
depth image. The proposed CCPNet improves the labeling coherence with a
cascaded context pyramid. Meanwhile, based on the low-level features, it
progressively restores the fine-structures of objects with Guided Residual
Refinement (GRR) modules. Our proposed framework has three outstanding
advantages: (1) it explicitly models the 3D spatial context for performance
improvement; (2) full-resolution 3D volumes are produced with
structure-preserving details; (3) light-weight models with low-memory
requirements are captured with a good extensibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that in spite of taking a single-view depth map, our proposed
framework can generate high-quality SSC results, and outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both the synthetic SUNCG and real NYU datasets.

measure the damping lengths of propagating slow magnetoacoustic waves observed

dependence of the damping length on temperature has been studied for the first

temperature, which is in contrast to the existing viewpoint. Comparing with the
corresponding theoretical values calculated from damping due to thermal

multi-device data analysis environments. A common method used for scaling is to
enlarge or shrink the entire scatterplot together with the inside points
synchronously and proportionally. This process is called geometric scaling.
However, geometric scaling of scatterplots may cause a perceptual bias, that
is, the perceived and physical values of visual features may be dissociated
with respect to geometric scaling. For example, if a scatterplot is projected
from a laptop to a large projector screen, then observers may feel that the
scatterplot shown on the projector has fewer points than that viewed on the
laptop. This paper presents an evaluation study on the perceptual bias of
visual features in scatterplots caused by geometric scaling. The study focuses
on three fundamental visual features (i.e., numerosity, correlation, and
cluster separation) and three hypotheses that are formulated on the basis of
our experience. We carefully design three controlled experiments by using
well-prepared synthetic data and recruit participants to complete the
experiments on the basis of their subjective experience. With a detailed
analysis of the experimental results, we obtain a set of instructive findings.
First, geometric scaling causes a bias that has a linear relationship with the
scale ratio. Second, no significant difference exists between the biases
measured from normally and uniformly distributed scatterplots. Third, changing
the point radius can correct the bias to a certain extent. These findings can
be used to inspire the design decisions of scatterplots in various scenarios.

frequency(RF) chains by handing over part of the coding work to the phase
shifting network, which can effectively improve energy efficiency. However,
conventional hybrid precoding algorithms based on mathematical means often
suffer from performance loss and high computational complexity. In this paper,
a novel BP-neural-network-enabled hybrid precoding algorithm is proposed, in
which the full-digital zero-forcing(ZF) precoding is set as the training
target. Considering that signals at the base station are complex, we choose the
complex neural network that has a richer representational capacity. Besides, we
present the activation function of the complex neural network and the gradient

the performance of the proposed hybrid precoding algorithm can optimally

Further, we propose a scheme to transport IP packets using CCN as a tunnel for

one-dimensional Bose gases (rubidium atoms) in a double well potential.
Employing matter-wave interference, we can measure the spatially resolved phase
difference between the two gases and consequently investigate spatial
correlations. By investigating whether higher order correlation functions can
be factorized into correlations of lower order, we can investigate the
interaction properties of the system. For a non-interacting system, all
correlation functions with orders greater than two factorize and one observes
Gaussian fluctuations.
  Here, we present the measurement of non-factorizing fourth-order correlation
functions, leading to an experimental characterization of the interactions
between the collective excitations of the quantum many-body system. The degree
of non-factorizibility, i.e., the degree of non-Gaussianity of the phase
fluctuations, depends on the tuneable tunneling strength between the wells.
  Starting from such a non-Gaussian state, we are able to observe the dynamical
evolution towards a state with factorizing correlation functions (Gaussian
fluctuations). We start in a double well with tunneling and then abruptly
decouple the two subsystems. Subsequently, we observe how the initially
non-Gaussian phase fluctuations become Gaussian.
  Moreover, we discuss the dynamical emergence of phase coherence in a double
well potential with tunneling. We experimentally investigate the evolution
starting from two different initial states. In one case, we split a cloud of
atoms into two and trigger global oscillations in their relative phase. The
oscillations subsequently damp and phase coherence sets in. In the other case,
two independent clouds are suddenly coupled by tunneling. Again, phase
coherence emerges between the two subsystems.

models the transport of these slaves through existing cities to the coastal

throughput of popular blockchains. To open a payment channel one has to publish
a transaction on-chain and pay the appropriate transaction fee. A transaction
can be routed in the network, as long as there is a path of channels with the
necessary capital. The intermediate nodes on this path can ask for a fee to
forward the transaction. Hence, opening channels, although costly, can benefit
a party, both by reducing the cost of the party for sending a transaction and
by collecting the fees from forwarding transactions of other parties.
  This trade-off spawns a network creation game between the channel parties. In
this work, we introduce the first game theoretic model for analyzing the
network creation game on blockchain payment channels. Further, we examine
various network structures (path, star, complete bipartite graph and clique)
and determine for each one of them the constraints (fee value) under which they
constitute a Nash equilibrium, given a fixed fee policy. Last, we show that the
star is a Nash equilibrium when each channel party can freely decide the

high-velocity clouds (UCHVCs), which were identified in the ALFALFA HI survey
as possible dwarf galaxies in or near the Local Group. To search for a resolved
stellar population associated with the HI gas in these objects, we carried out
a series of steps designed to identify stellar overdensities in our optical
images. We identify five objects that are likely stellar counterparts to the
UCHVCs, at distances of $\sim 350$ kpc to $\sim 1.6$ Mpc. Two of the
counterparts were already described in Janesh et al. (2015) and Janesh et al.
(2017); the estimated distance and detection significance for one of them
changed in the final analysis of the full pODI data set. At their estimated
distances, the detected objects have HI masses from $2 \times 10^4$ to $3
\times 10^6$ Msun, $M_V$ from -1.4 to -7.1, and stellar masses from $4 \times
10^2$ to $4 \times 10^5$ Msun. None of the objects shows evidence of a young
stellar population. Their properties would make the UCHVCs some of the most
extreme objects in and around the Local Group, comparable to ultra faint dwarf
galaxies in their stellar populations, but with significant gas content. Such
objects probe the extreme end of the galaxy mass function, and provide a
testbed for theories regarding the baryonic feedback processes that impact star
formation and galaxy evolution in this low-mass regime.

  Images","Accepted at ICCV 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D human shape estimation from single
RGB images. While the recent progress in convolutional neural networks has
allowed impressive results for 3D human pose estimation, estimating the full 3D
shape of a person is still an open issue. Model-based approaches can output
precise meshes of naked under-cloth human bodies but fail to estimate details
and un-modelled elements such as hair or clothing. On the other hand,
non-parametric volumetric approaches can potentially estimate complete shapes
but, in practice, they are limited by the resolution of the output grid and
cannot produce detailed estimates. In this work, we propose a non-parametric
approach that employs a double depth map to represent the 3D shape of a person:
a visible depth map and a ""hidden"" depth map are estimated and combined, to
reconstruct the human 3D shape as done with a ""mould"". This representation
through 2D depth maps allows a higher resolution output with a much lower
dimension than voxel-based volumetric representations. Additionally, our fully
derivable depth-based model allows us to efficiently incorporate a
discriminator in an adversarial fashion to improve the accuracy and ""humanness""
of the 3D output. We train and quantitatively validate our approach on SURREAL
and on 3D-HUMANS, a new photorealistic dataset made of semi-synthetic in-house
videos annotated with 3D ground truth surfaces.

  Computation (Extended Version)","Extended version with appendix",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work introduces the novel concept of kind refinement, which we develop
in the context of an explicitly polymorphic ML-like language with type-level
computation. Just as type refinements embed rich specifications by means of
comprehension principles expressed by predicates over values in the type
domain, kind refinements provide rich kind specifications by means of
predicates over types in the kind domain. By leveraging our powerful refinement
kind discipline, types in our language are not just used to statically classify
program expressions and values, but also conveniently manipulated as tree-like
data structures, with their kinds refined by logical constraints on such
structures. Remarkably, the resulting typing and kinding disciplines allow for
powerful forms of type reflection, ad-hoc polymorphism and type
meta-programming, which are often found in modern software development, but not
typically expressible in a type-safe manner in general purpose languages. We
validate our approach both formally and pragmatically by establishing the
standard meta-theoretical results of type safety and via a prototype
implementation of a kind checker, type checker and interpreter for our
language.

coefficient under lateral force excitations avoiding the use of standard
mathematical tire models, which may provide a more efficient method with robust

Simulations based on a realistic vehicle model are carried out on different

precipitation rate (275mm/yr at 1200meters above ground level) with low
relative seasonal variation (+/-11%) over the peripheral areas. Over the

larger relative seasonal variation (+/-143%). A second study that follows a
geographical division highlights the average vertical structure of
precipitation and temperature depending on the regions and their interactions
with topography. In particular, over ice-shelves, we see a strong dependence of
the distribution of precipitation on the sea-ice coverage. Finally, the
relationship between precipitation and temperature is analyzed and compared
with a simple analytical relationship. This study highlights that precipitation
is largely dependent on the advection of air masses along the topographic
slopes with an average vertical wind of 0.02m/s. This provides new diagnostics

expected to be metallic. Yet, CoO is strongly insulating owing to significant
electronic correlations, thus classifying it as a Mott insulator. We
investigate the magnetic fluctuations in CoO using neutron spectroscopy. The
strong and spatially far-reaching exchange constants reported in [Sarte et al.
Phys. Rev. B 98 024415 (2018)], combined with the single-ion spin-orbit
coupling of similar magnitude [Cowley et al. Phys. Rev. B 88, 205117 (2013)]
results in significant mixing between $j_{eff}$ spin-orbit levels in the low
temperature magnetically ordered phase. The high degree of entanglement,
combined with the structural domains originating from the Jahn-Teller
structural distortion at $\sim$ 300 K, make the magnetic excitation spectrum
highly structured in both energy and momentum. We extend previous theoretical
work on PrTl$_{3}$ [Buyers et al. Phys. Rev. B 11, 266 (1975)] to construct a
mean-field and multi-level spin exciton model employing the aforementioned spin
exchange and spin-orbit coupling parameters for coupled Co$^{2+}$ ions on a
rocksalt lattice. This parameterization, based on a tetragonally distorted
type-II antiferromagnetic unit cell, captures both the sharp low energy
excitations at the magnetic zone center, and the energy broadened peaks at the
zone boundary. However, the model fails to describe the momentum dependence of
the excitations at high energy transfers, where the neutron response decays
faster with momentum than the Co$^{2+}$ form factor. We discuss such a failure
in terms of a possible breakdown of localized spin-orbit excitons at high
energy transfers.

fifth generation new radio (5G NR) standard due to its capacity-achievable
property. Traditional polar decoding algorithms such as successive cancellation
(SC) suffer from high latency problem because of their sequential decoding
nature. Neural network decoder (NND) has been proved to be a candidate for
polar decoder since it is capable of oneshot decoding and parallel computing.
Whereas, the bit-errorrate (BER) performance of NND is still inferior to that
of SC algorithm. In this paper, we propose a residual neural network decoder
(RNND) for polar codes. Different from previous works which directly use neural
network for decoding symbols received from the channel, the proposed RNND
introduces a denoising module based on residual learning before NND. The
proposed residual learning denoiser is able to remove remarkable amount of
noise from received signals. Numerical results show that our proposed RNND
outperforms traditional NND with regard to the BER performance under comparable
latency.

parametrized by the coefficients of a deep neural network. We then use a

glass structure remains more disordered, as reflected in the shape of the pair
correlation function. The results of mechanical testing demonstrate that both
the shear modulus and yielding peak increase significantly when the annealing

strong function of strain rate only for samples equilibrated at sufficiently

system theoretic properties and to construct control laws, without using a

unique identification of the underlying dynamical system from the data within a
given model class. In this paper, we develop a new framework in order to work
with data that are not necessarily persistently exciting. Within this
framework, we investigate necessary and sufficient conditions on the
informativity of data for several data-driven analysis and control problems.
For certain analysis and design problems, our results reveal that persistency
of excitation is not necessary. In fact, in these cases data-driven
analysis/control is possible while the combination of (unique) system
identification and model-based control is not. For certain other control
problems, our results justify the use of persistently exciting data as
data-driven control is possible only with data that are informative for system
identification.

developed Cell COunt RegularizeD Convolutional neural Network (ConCORDe-Net)
which integrates conventional dice overlap and a new cell count loss function
for optimizing cell detection, followed by a multi-stage convolutional neural
network for cell classification. In total, 20447 cells, belonging to five cell
classes were annotated by experts from 175 patches extracted from 6
whole-tumour mIHC images. These patches were randomly split into training,
validation and testing sets. Using ConCORDe-Net, we obtained a cell detection
F1 score of 0.873, which is the best score compared to three state of the art
methods. In particular, ConCORDe-Net excels at detecting closely located and
weakly stained cells compared to other methods. Incorporating cell count loss
in the objective function regularizes the network to learn weak gradient
boundaries and separate weakly stained cells from background artefacts.
Moreover, cell classification accuracy of 96.5% was achieved. These results
support that incorporating problem-specific knowledge such as cell count into

of $\xi$-$\mathcal{G}$projective dimension by using derived functors on
$\mathcal{C}$. Second, let $\mathcal{P}(\xi)$ (resp. $\mathcal{I}(\xi)$) be a
generating (resp. cogenerating) subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$. We show that the
following equality holds under some assumptions:
$$\sup\{\xi\textrm{-}\mathcal{G}{\rm pd}M \ | \ \textrm{for} \ \textrm{any} \
M\in{\mathcal{C}}\}=\sup\{\xi\textrm{-}\mathcal{G}{\rm id}M \ | \ \textrm{for}
\ \textrm{any} \ M\in{\mathcal{C}}\},$$ where $\xi\textrm{-}\mathcal{G}{\rm
pd}M$ (resp. $\xi\textrm{-}\mathcal{G}{\rm id}M$) denotes
$\xi$-$\mathcal{G}$projective (resp. $\xi$-$\mathcal{G}$injective) dimension of
$M$. As an application, our main results generalize their work by Bennis-Mahdou
and Ren-Liu. Moreover, our proof is not far from the usual module or
triangulated case.

  \""Oktem","Multi-Scale Learned Iterative Reconstruction",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.NA cs.NE math.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model-based learned iterative reconstruction methods have recently been shown
to outperform classical reconstruction algorithms. Applicability of these
methods to large scale inverse problems is however limited by the available
memory for training and extensive training times, the latter due to
computationally expensive forward models. As a possible solution to these
restrictions we propose a multi-scale learned iterative reconstruction scheme
that computes iterates on discretisations of increasing resolution. This
procedure does not only reduce memory requirements, it also considerably speeds
up reconstruction and training times, but most importantly is scalable to large
scale inverse problems with non-trivial forward operators, such as those that
arise in many 3D tomographic applications. In particular, we propose a hybrid
network that combines the multi-scale iterative approach with a particularly
expressive network architecture which in combination exhibits excellent
scalability in 3D.
  Applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated for 3D cone beam computed
tomography from real measurement data of an organic phantom. Additionally, we
examine scalability and reconstruction quality in comparison to established
learned reconstruction methods in two dimensions for low dose computed
tomography on human phantoms.

but the analytical treatment of transitions from chimeras to coherent states
remains a challenge. Here we analytically derive the necessary conditions for
this transition by means of the coherent stability function approach, which is
akin to the master stability function approach that is traditionally used to
study the stability of synchronization in coupled oscillators. In chimera
states, there is typically at least one group of oscillators that evolves in a
drifting, random manner, while other groups of oscillators follow a smoother,
more coherent profile. In the coherent state, there thus exists a smooth
functional relationship between the oscillators. This lays the foundation for
the coherent stability function approach, where we determine the stability of
the coherent state. We subsequently test the analytical prediction numerically
by calculating the strength of incoherence during the transition point. We use
leech neurons, which exhibit a coexistence of chaotic and periodic tonic
spiking depending on initial conditions, coupled via non-local electrical
synapses, to demonstrate our approach. We systematically explore various
dynamical states with the focus on the transitions between chimeras and
coherence, fully confirming the validity of the coherent stability function. We
also observe complete synchronization for higher values of the coupling
strength, which we verify by the master stability function approach.

We investigate the evolution of X-ray selected tidal disruption events.
Methods. New events are found in near-real time data from XMM-Newton slews and
are monitored by multi-wavelength facilities. Results. In August 2016, X-ray
emission was detected from the galaxy XMMSL2 J144605.0+685735 (a.k.a. 2MASX
14460522+6857311), a factor 20 times higher than an upper limit from 25 years
earlier. The X-ray flux was flat for ~100 days and then fell by a factor 100
over the following 500 days. The UV flux was stable for the first 400 days
before fading by a magnitude, while the optical (U,B,V bands) have been roughly
constant for 850 days. Optically, the galaxy appears to be quiescent, at a
distance of $127\pm{4}$ Mpc (z=$0.029\pm{0.001}$) with a spectrum consisting of
a young stellar population of age 1-5 Gyr, an older population and a total
stellar mass of ~6 x $10^{9}$ solar masses. The bolometric luminosity peaked at
L bol ~ $10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ with an X-ray spectrum that may be modeled by a
power-law of $\Gamma$~2.6 or Comptonisation of a low-temperature thermal
component by thermal electrons. We consider a tidal disruption event to be the
most likely cause of the flare. Radio emission was absent in this event down to
< 10$\mu$Jy, which limits the total energy of a hypothetical off-axis jet to E
< 5 x $10^{50}$ ergs. The independent behaviour of the optical, UV and X-ray
light curves challenges models where the UV emission is produced by
reprocessing of thermal nuclear emission or by stream-stream collisions. We
suggest that the observed UV emission may have been produced from a truncated
accretion disk and the X-rays from Compton upscattering of these disk photons.

$G_{\mu\nu}(t)=(B^2(t),-A^2(t),-A^2(t),-A^2(t)), \ A\propto B\propto t^{1/2}$,
where $t$ has the operational meaning of time in $F$ frame. We assume a cosmic
action $S\equiv S_{cos}$ involving $G_{\mu\nu}(t)$ and derive the `Okubo
equation' of motion, $G^{\mu\nu}(t)\partial_\mu S \partial_\nu S - m^2=0$, for
a distant galaxy with mass $m$. This cosmic equation predicts an exact
recession velocity, $\dot{r}=rH/[1/2 +\sqrt{1/4+r^2H^2/C_o^2} ]<C_o$, where
$H=\dot{A}(t)/A(t)$ and $C_o=B/A$, as observed in the inertial frame $F$. For
small velocities, we have the usual Hubble's law $\dot{r} \approx rH$ for
recession velocities. Following the formulation of the accelerated Wu-Doppler
effect, we investigate cosmic redshifts z as measured in $F$. It is natural to
assume the massless Okubo equation, $G^{\mu\nu}(t)\partial_\mu \psi_e
\partial_\nu \psi_e=0$, for light emitted from accelerated distant galaxies.
Based on the principle of limiting continuation of physical laws, we obtain a
transformation for covariant wave 4-vectors between and inertial and an
accelerated frame, and predict a relationship for the exact recession velocity
and cosmic redshift, $z=[(1+V_r)/(1-V_r^2)^{1/2}] - 1$, where
$V_r=\dot{r}/C_o<1$, as observed in the inertial frame $F$. These predictions
of the cosmic model are consistent with experiments for small velocities and
should be further tested.

working material is the Hayward-AdS (HAdS) BH. In the extended phase space, we
investigate the heat engine efficiency of the HAdS BH by defining the
cosmological constant as the thermodynamic pressure $P$ and deriving the
mechanical work from the $PdV$ terms. Then, we obtain the relation between the
efficiency and the entropy/pressure and plot these function figures. Meanwhile,
we compare the relation between the HAdS BH with that of the Bardeen-AdS (BAdS)
BH, which is found that the efficiency of the HAdS BH increase with increase
the magnetic charge $q$ in contrast to that of the BAdS BH decrease with
increase the magnetic charge $q$. We found that the HAdS BH is more efficient
than the BAdS BH, and guess that is related to the BH structure.

memories in biological systems. Motivated by the processes that are known to be
involved in sleep generation in biological networks, we developed an algorithm
that implements a sleep-like phase in artificial neural networks (ANNs). After
initial training phase, we convert the ANN to a spiking neural network (SNN)
and simulate an offline sleep-like phase using spike-timing dependent
plasticity rules to modify synaptic weights. The SNN is then converted back to
the ANN and evaluated or trained on new inputs. We demonstrate several
performance improvements after applying this processing to ANNs trained on
MNIST, CUB200 and a motivating toy dataset. First, in an incremental learning
framework, sleep is able to recover older tasks that were otherwise forgotten
in the ANN without sleep phase due to catastrophic forgetting. Second, sleep
results in forward transfer learning of unseen tasks. Finally, sleep improves
generalization ability of the ANNs to classify images with various types of
noise. We provide a theoretical basis for the beneficial role of the
brain-inspired sleep-like phase for the ANNs and present an algorithmic way for
future implementations of the various features of sleep in deep learning ANNs.
Overall, these results suggest that biological sleep can help mitigate a number

particular. Here, we consider an attack in which an adversary attempts to
manipulate the behavior of energy consumers by sending fake discount
notifications encouraging them to shift their consumption into the peak-demand
period. We conduct surveys to assess the propensity of people to follow-through
on such notifications and forward them to their friends. This allows us to
model how the disinformation propagates through social networks. Finally, using
Greater London as a case study, we show that disinformation can indeed be used
to orchestrate an attack wherein unwitting consumers synchronize their
energy-usage patterns, resulting in blackouts on a city-scale. These findings
demonstrate that in an era when disinformation can be weaponized, system

obtained by measurement of the local and instantaneous heat flux density
produced by sprays of variable mass flux, drop diameter and impact velocity.
These spray parameters are accurately characterized using a phase Doppler

theoretical model has been developed for heat conduction in the thin expanding

For instance, sorafenib (BAY 43-900) was used as monotherapy in at least 29
phase I trials according to a recent search in clinicaltrials.gov. Since the
toxicity may not be directly related to the specific indication, synthesizing
the information from several studies might be worthwhile. However, this is
rarely done in practice and only a fixed-effect meta-analysis framework was
proposed to date. We developed a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis
methodology to pool several phase I trials and suggest the MTD. A curve free
hierarchical model on the logistic scale with random effects, accounting for
between-trial heterogeneity, is used to model the probability of toxicity
across the investigated doses. An Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Gaussian process is
adopted for the random effects structure. Prior distributions for the curve
free model are based on a latent Gamma process. An extensive simulation study
showed good performance of the proposed method also under model deviations.
Sharing information between phase I studies can improve the precision of MTD

Typical large-scale runs of the algorithms can use hundreds of CPUs to learn
hundreds of dictionary elements from data with tens of millions of

works have shown that the performance of quantization systems acquiring
multiple analog signals using scalar analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can be
significantly improved by properly processing the analog signals prior to
quantization. However, the design of such hybrid quantizers is quite complex,
and their implementation requires complete knowledge of the statistical model
of the analog signal, which may not be available in practice. In this work we
design data-driven task-oriented quantization systems with scalar ADCs, which
determine how to map an analog signal into its digital representation using
deep learning tools. These representations are designed to facilitate the task
of recovering underlying information from the quantized signals, which can be a
set of parameters to estimate, or alternatively, a classification task. By
utilizing deep learning, we circumvent the need to explicitly recover the
system model and to find the proper quantization rule for it. Our main target
application is multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication receivers,
which simultaneously acquire a set of analog signals, and are commonly subject
to constraints on the number of bits. Our results indicate that, in a MIMO
channel estimation setup, the proposed deep task-bask quantizer is capable of
approaching the optimal performance limits dictated by indirect rate-distortion
theory, achievable using vector quantizers and requiring complete knowledge of
the underlying statistical model. Furthermore, for a symbol detection scenario,
it is demonstrated that the proposed approach can realize reliable
bit-efficient hybrid MIMO receivers capable of setting their quantization rule
in light of the task, e.g., to minimize the bit error rate.

its evolving versions will be launched over the coming years. However,
according to exposing the inherent constraints of 5G and the emerging
applications and services with stringent requirements e.g. latency, energy/bit,
traffic capacity, peak data rate, and reliability, telecom researchers are
turning their attention to conceptualize the next generation of wireless
communications, i.e. 6G. In this paper, we investigate 6G challenges,
requirements, and trends. Furthermore, we discuss how artificial intelligence
(AI) techniques can contribute to 6G. Based on the requirements and solutions,
we identify some new fascinating services and use-cases of 6G, which can not be
supported by 5G appropriately. Moreover, we explain some research directions
that lead to the successful conceptualization and implementation of 6G.

  Issues and Future Directions","40 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables, submitted to IEEE Journal",,"10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980369",,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tactile Internet (TI) is envisioned to create a paradigm shift from the
content-oriented communications to steer/control-based communications by
enabling real-time transmission of haptic information (i.e., touch, actuation,
motion, vibration, surface texture) over Internet in addition to the
conventional audiovisual and data traffics. This emerging TI technology is
expected to create numerous opportunities for technology markets in a wide
variety of applications ranging from teleoperation systems and AR/VR to
automotive safety and eHealthcare towards addressing the complex problems of
human society. However, the realization of TI over wireless media in the
upcoming 5G and beyond networks creates various non-conventional communication
challenges and stringent requirements. To this end, this paper aims to provide
a holistic view on wireless TI along with a thorough review of the existing
literature, to identify and analyze the involved technical issues, to highlight
potential solutions and to propose future research directions. First, starting
with the vision of TI and recent advances and a review of related
survey/overview articles, we present a generalized framework for wireless TI in
the Beyond 5G Era including a TI architecture, main technical requirements, key
application areas and potential enabling technologies. Subsequently, we provide
a comprehensive review of the existing TI works by broadly categorizing them
into three main paradigms; namely, haptic communications, wireless AR/VR, and
autonomous, intelligent and cooperative mobility systems. Next, potential
enabling technologies across physical/MAC and network layers are identified and
discussed in detail. Also, security and privacy issues of TI applications are
discussed along with some promising enablers. Finally, we present some open
research challenges and recommend promising future research directions.
