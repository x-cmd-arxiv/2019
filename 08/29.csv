about 700 new advanced optical sensors. This will expand IceCube's capabilities

will be multi-PMT Digital Optical Modules, mDOMs, each featuring 24 three-inch
class photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) pointing uniformly in all directions,
thereby providing an almost homogeneous angular coverage. The signal from each
PMT is digitized individually, providing directional information for the
incident photons. Together, the 24 PMTs provide an effective photosensitive

mDOM design challenges arise from the constraints on the module size and power
needed for the 24-channel high-voltage and readout systems. This contribution
presents an mDOM design that meets these challenges and discusses the

our approach is superior for strongly charged chains and can also predict the

have non-empty $r$-fold intersection. Almost any collection of fewer points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be so divided, and in these cases we ask if the set can
nonetheless be $P(r,d)$--partitioned, i.e., split into $r$ subsets so that
there exist $r$ points, one from each resulting convex hull, which form the
vertex set of a prescribed convex $d$--polytope $P(r,d)$. Our main theorem
shows that this is the case for any generic $T(r,2)-2$ points in the plane and
any $r\geq 3$ when $P(r,2)=P_r$ is a regular $r$--gon, and moreover that
$T(r,2)-2$ is tight. For higher dimensional polytopes and $r=r_1\cdots r_k$,
$r_i \geq 3$, this generalizes to $T(r,2k)-2k$ generic points in
$\mathbb{R}^{2k}$ and orthogonal products $P(r,2k)=P_{r_1}\times \cdots \times

dependence of the shear stress on the strength of an external magnetic field
($H$) in a liquid-crystalline mixture of magnetic and non-magnetic anisotropic
particles. This non-monotonic behavior is in sharp contrast with the
well-studied monotonic $H$-dependency of the shear stress in conventional
ferrofluids, where the shear stress increases with $H$ until it reaches a
saturation value. We relate the origin of this non-monotonicity to the
competing effects of particle alignment along the shear-induced direction, on
the one hand, and the magnetic field direction, on the other hand. To isolate
the role of these competing effects, we consider a two-component mixture
composed of particles with effectively identical steric interactions, where the
orientations of a small fraction, i.e.\ the magnetic ones, are coupled to the
external magnetic field. By increasing $H$ from zero, the orientations of the
magnetic particles show a Fr\'{e}ederickz-like transition and eventually start
deviating from the shear-induced orientation, leading to an increase in shear
stress. Upon further increase of $H$, a demixing of the magnetic particles from
the non-magnetic ones occurs which leads to a drop in shear stress, hence
creating a non-monotonic response to $H$. Unlike the equilibrium demixing
phenomena reported in previous studies, the demixing observed here is neither
due to size-polydispersity nor due to a wall-induced nematic transition. Based
on a simplified Onsager analysis, we rather argue that it occurs solely due to
packing entropy of particles with different shear- or magnetic-field-induced
orientations.

One solution to this problem is to develop an Automated Responding System for

human response. Toward designing such system, we have conducted an empirical
study of the characteristics of mobile apps' reviews and their human-written
responses. We found that an app reviews can have multiple fragments at sentence
level with different topics and intentions. Similarly, a response also can be
divided into multiple fragments with unique intentions to answer certain parts
of their review (e.g., complaints, requests, or information seeking). We have
also identified several characteristics of review (rating, topics, intentions,
quantitative text feature) that can be used to rank review by their priority of
need for response. In addition, we identified the degree of re-usability of
past responses is based on their context (single app, apps of the same
category, and their common features). Last but not least, a responses can be
reused in another review if some parts of it can be replaced by a placeholder
that is either a named-entity or a hyperlink. Based on those findings, we
discuss the implications of developing an Automated Responding System to help

that the caloric curve $T_{\infty}(E)$ has the form of a double spiral whose
shape depends on the compactness parameter $\nu=GNm/Rc^2$. The double spiral
shrinks as $\nu$ increases and finally disappears when $\nu_{\rm max}=0.1764$.
Therefore, general relativistic effects render the system more unstable. On the
other hand, the cold spiral and the hot spiral move away from each other as
$\nu$ decreases. Using a normalization $\Lambda=-ER/GN^2m^2$ and $\eta=GNm^2/R
k_B T_{\infty}$ appropriate to the nonrelativistic limit, and considering
$\nu\rightarrow 0$, the hot spiral goes to infinity and the caloric curve tends
towards a limit curve (determined by the Emden equation) exhibiting a single
cold spiral, as found in former works. Using another normalization ${\cal
M}=GM/Rc^2$ and ${\cal B}={Rc^4}/{GNk_B T_{\infty}}$ appropriate to the
ultrarelativistic limit, and considering $\nu\rightarrow 0$, the cold spiral
goes to infinity and the caloric curve tends towards a limit curve (determined
by the general relativistic Emden equation) exhibiting a single hot spiral.
This result is new. We discuss the analogies and the differences between this

  messages is completely removed",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Caching is an efficient way to reduce network traffic congestion during peak
hours by storing some content at the user's local cache memory without
knowledge of later demands. For the shared-link caching model, Maddah-Ali and
Niesen (MAN) proposed a two-phase (placement and delivery) coded caching
strategy, which is order optimal within a constant factor. However, in the MAN
coded caching scheme, each user can obtain the information about the demands of
other users, i.e., the MAN coded caching scheme is inherently prone to
tampering and spying the activity/demands of other users. In this paper, we
formulate an information-theoretic shared-link caching model with private
demands, where there are K cache-aided users (which can cache up to M files)
connected to a central server with access to N files. Each user requests L
files. Our objective is to design a two-phase private caching scheme with
minimum load while preserving the information-theoretic privacy of the demands
of each user with respect to other users.
  We propose two novel private coded caching schemes with the general
underlying idea, which is to satisfy the users' requests by generating a set of
coded multicast messages that is symmetric with respect to the library files.
In the first scheme, we introduce a number of virtual users such that each
L-subset of files is demanded by K real or virtual (effective) users and use
the MAN delivery to generate multicast messages. This scheme incurs in an
extremely large sub-packetization. Then, we propose a second scheme based on a
novel MDS-coded cache placement. In this case, we generate multicast messages
where each multicast message contains one MDS-coded symbol from each file in
the library and thus is again symmetric over all the files from the viewpoint
of each user. The proposed schemes are generally order optimal except for the
case where N > LK and M< N/K.

is an online model able to (1) determine states uniquely as needed, (2)
recognize states, and (3) identify state-transitions, is introduced.
  In this study, the e-FSM's capabilities are explained and illustrated by
simulating a simple car-following scenario. As a vehicle controller, the
Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is implemented, and different sets of IDM
parameters are assigned to the following vehicle for simulating various
situations (including the collision). While simulating the car-following
scenario, e-FSM recognizes and determines the states and identifies the
transition matrices by suggested methods.
  To verify if e-FSM can recognize and determine states uniquely, we analyze
whether the same state is recognized under the identical situation. The
difference between probability distributions of predicted and recognized states
is measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) method to validate the
accuracy of identified transition-matrices. As shown in the results, the
Dead-End state which has latent-risk of the collision is uniquely determined
and consistently recognized. Also, the probability distributions of the
predicted state are significantly similar to the recognized state, declaring
that the state-transitions are precisely identified.

therefore can readily be integrated with an adaptive meshing scheme. This
effectively enables the 3D topology optimization of thin-walled structures with
a desktop PC, by significantly reducing computation in large void regions that
appear during optimization. The uniform feature size constraint, when applied
to 3D structures, can produce thin-walled geometries with branches and holes,
which have previously been difficult to obtain via topology optimization. The
resulting thin-walled structures can provide valuable insights for designing
thin-walled lightweight structures made of stamping, investment casting and

equivalent of atomicity. However, it has been shown [1] that replacing atomic

distribution of execution outcomes in randomized algorithms. Thus, linearizable
objects are not always suitable replacements for atomic objects. A stricter
correctness condition called strong linearizability has been developed and
shown to be appropriate for randomized algorithms in a strong adaptive
adversary model [1]. We devise several new lock-free strongly linearizable
implementations from atomic registers. In particular, we give the first
strongly linearizable lock-free snapshot implementation that uses bounded
space. This improves on the unbounded space solution of Denysyuk and Woelfel
[2]. As a building block, our algorithm uses a lock-free strongly linearizable
ABA-detecting register. We obtain this object by modifying the wait-free
linearizable ABA-detecting register of Aghazadeh and Woelfel [3], which, as we
show, is not strongly linearizable. Aspnes and Herlihy [4] identified a wide
class types that have wait-free linearizable implementations from atomic

one overwrites the other. Aspnes and Herlihy gave a general wait-free

which prove that DNNs can approximate solutions of certain PDEs without the
curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of real parameters used to
describe the DNN grows at most polynomially both in the PDE dimension and the
reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy. One key argument in most
of these results is, first, to use a Monte Carlo approximation scheme which can
approximate the solution of the PDE under consideration at a fixed space-time
point without the curse of dimensionality and, thereafter, to prove that DNNs
are flexible enough to mimic the behaviour of the used approximation scheme.
Having this in mind, one could aim for a general abstract result which shows
under suitable assumptions that if a certain function can be approximated by
any kind of (Monte Carlo) approximation scheme without the curse of
dimensionality, then this function can also be approximated with DNNs without
the curse of dimensionality. It is a key contribution of this article to make a
first step towards this direction. In particular, the main result of this
paper, essentially, shows that if a function can be approximated by means of
some suitable discrete approximation scheme without the curse of dimensionality
and if there exist DNNs which satisfy certain regularity properties and which
approximate this discrete approximation scheme without the curse of
dimensionality, then the function itself can also be approximated with DNNs
without the curse of dimensionality. As an application of this result we
establish that solutions of suitable Kolmogorov PDEs can be approximated with

a constant upwelling and an interior diapycnal diffusivity of
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$. However, typical observed
diffusivities in the interior are $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ m$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$.
Recent work suggested that the deep stratification is set by Southern Ocean
(SO) isopycnal slopes, fixed by SO eddies, that communicate the surface outcrop
positions to the deep ocean. It is shown here, using an idealized ocean general
circulation model, that SO eddies alone cannot lead to the observed exponential
temperature profile, and that interior mixing must contribute. Strong diapycnal
mixing concentrated near the ocean boundaries is shown to be balanced locally
by upwelling. A one-dimensional Munk-like balance in these boundary mixing
areas, although with much larger mixing and upwelling, leads to an exponential
deep temperature stratification, which propagates via isopycnal mixing to the
ocean interior. The exponential profile is robust to vertical variations in the
vertical velocity, and persists despite the observed weak interior diapycnal
mixing. Southern Ocean eddies link the surface water mass transformation by
air-sea fluxes with the deep stratification, but the eddies do not determine
the stratification itself. These results reconcile the observed exponential
interior deep temperature stratification, the weak diapycnal diffusivity
observed in tracer release experiments, and the role of Southern Ocean

image reconstruction of the abdominal and in-utero magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). The state-of-art methods are based on slice-to-volume registration (SVR)
where multiple 2D image stacks are acquired in three orthogonal orientations.
In this work, we present a novel reconstruction pipeline that only needs one
orientation of 2D MRI scans and can reconstruct the full high-resolution image
without masking or registration steps. The framework consists of two main
stages: the respiratory motion estimation using a self-supervised recurrent
neural network, which learns the respiratory signals that are naturally
embedded in the asymmetry relationship of the neighborhood slices and cluster
them according to a respiratory state. Then, we train a 3D deconvolutional
network for super-resolution (SR) reconstruction of the sparsely selected 2D
images using integrated reconstruction and total variation loss. We evaluate
the classification accuracy on 5 simulated images and compare our results with
the SVR method in adult abdominal and in-utero MRI scans. The results show that
the proposed pipeline can accurately estimate the respiratory state and
reconstruct 4D SR volumes with better or similar performance to the 3D SVR
pipeline with less than 20\% sparsely selected slices. The method has great
potential to transform the 4D abdominal and in-utero MRI in clinical practice.

size of a smallest tessellation cover. The \textsc{$t$-tessellability} problem
aims to decide whether a graph $G$ has $T(G)\leq t$ and is
$\mathcal{NP}$-complete for $t\geq 3$. Since the number of edges of a maximum

good tessellable graphs as the graphs~$G$ such that $T(G)=is(G)$. The
\textsc{good tessellable recognition (gtr)} problem aims to decide whether $G$
is a good tessellable graph. We show that \textsc{gtr} is

also when the gap between $T(G)$ and $is(G)$ is large. As a byproduct, we
obtain graph classes that obey the corresponding computational complexity

Remarkably, the capacity retains $\ge$200~mAhg$^{-1}$ even after 400~cycles at

We find the diffusion coefficient of NVO--Na cells similar to that of NVO--Li.
On the other hand, our charge discharge measurements suggest that the overall

use the density functional theory to simulate the energetics of Na vacancy
formation in the bulk of the NVO structure, which is found to be 0.88~eV higher
than that of the most stable (100) surface. Thus, the Na ion incorporation at

order at $N = 2$. We quantitatively study the dependence on $N$ of the degree
of discontinuity of the phase transitions from a completely ordered to a
completely disordered state. We demonstrate that the phase transition is
discontinuous at least up to $N = 7$. The dependence on $N$ is nontrivial in
that the degree of discontinuity grows with $N$ at least for low $N$.
Furthermore we demonstrate that when, at increased coupling strength, the phase
transitions of the neutral and changed sectors of the model split, the
superfluid phase transition is also discontinuous, at least for $N = 3$ and $N
= 4$. Via a duality argument, this indicates that van der Waals-type
interaction between directed loops may be responsible for the first-order phase
transitions in these models.

It is
commonly conducted using standard computational tools, such as FSL, SPM,
multi-atlas segmentation etc, which are often registration-based and suffer
from expensive computation cost. Recently, there is an increased interest using
deep neural networks for brain image segmentation, which have demonstrated
advantages in both speed and performance. However, neural networks-based
approaches normally require a large amount of manual annotations for optimising
the massive amount of network parameters. For 3D networks used in volumetric
image segmentation, this has become a particular challenge, as a 3D network
consists of many more parameters compared to its 2D counterpart. Manual
annotation of 3D brain images is extremely time-consuming and requires
extensive involvement of trained experts. To address the challenge with limited
manual annotations, here we propose a novel multi-task learning framework for
brain image segmentation, which utilises a large amount of automatically
generated partial annotations together with a small set of manually created
full annotations for network training. Our method yields a high performance
comparable to state-of-the-art methods for whole brain segmentation.

signatures at dark matter direct detection and neutrino experiments. We study
the possible signals from fermionic absorption by nuclear targets, which we
divide into two classes of four Fermi operators: neutral and charged current.
In the neutral current signal, dark matter is absorbed by a target nucleus and
a neutrino is emitted. This results in a characteristically different nuclear
recoil energy spectrum from that of elastic scattering. The charged current
channel leads to induced $\beta$ decays in isotopes which are stable in vacuum
as well as shifts of the kinematic endpoint of $ \beta$ spectra in unstable
isotopes. To confirm the possibility of observing these signals in light of
other constraints, we introduce UV completions of example higher dimensional
operators that lead to fermionic absorption signals and study their
phenomenology. Most prominently, dark matter which exhibits fermionic
absorption signals is necessarily unstable leading to stringent bounds from
indirect detection searches. Nevertheless, we find a large viable parameter
space in which dark matter is sufficiently long lived and detectable in current
and future experiments.

Here we present the most drastic AGN luminosity decline by a factor of $\gtrsim
10^{3}$ constrained by a NuSTAR X-ray observation of the nearby galaxy Arp 187,
which is a promising ""dead"" quasar whose current activity seems quiet but whose
past activity of $L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is still observable
at a large scale by its light echo. The obtained upper bound of the X-ray
luminosity is $\log (L_{\rm 2-10 keV}/{\rm erg} {\rm s}^{-1}) < 41.2$,
corresponding to $\log (L_\mathrm{bol}/{\rm erg} {\rm s}^{-1}) < 42.5$,
indicating an inactive central engine. Even if a putative torus model with
$N_\mathrm{H} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ is assumed, the strong
upper-bound still holds with $\log (L_{\rm 2-10 keV}/{\rm erg} {\rm s}^{-1}) <
41.8$ or $\log (L_\mathrm{bol}/{\rm erg} {\rm s}^{-1}) < 43.1$. Given the
expected size of the narrow line region, this luminosity decrease by a factor
of $\gtrsim 10^3$ must have occurred within $\lesssim 10^4$ yr. This extremely
rapid luminosity/accretion shutdown is puzzling and it requires one burst-like
accretion mechanism producing a clear outer boundary for an accretion disk. We
raise two possible scenarios realizing such an accretion mechanism: a mass
accretion 1) by the tidal disruption of a molecular cloud and/or 2) by the gas
depletion as a result of vigorous nuclear starformation after rapid mass inflow
to the central engine.

strength of most of the emission lines decreased. However, the high-excitation
lines significantly strengthened in comparison with the Balmer lines. Many
lines show a mix of broad emission and narrow absorption components. H$\alpha$
in superoutburst was much narrower than in quiescence. Other emission lines
also narrowed in outburst, but they had not become as narrow as H$\alpha$.
Doppler maps of H$\alpha$ in quiescence, and of the H$\beta$ and HeI lines in

significantly lower velocities. We show that the accretion disc radius of HT
Cas during its superoutburst has become hot but remained the same size as it
was in quiescence. Instead, we detected cool gas beyond the Roche lobe of the
white dwarf that may have been expelled from the hot disc during the

realize intrinsically robust physical qubits that can be used for the storage

physical systems, weak perturbations in the form of induced interactions and
disorder are unavoidable and can be detrimental to the stored information. At
the same time, the latter may in fact be beneficial; for instance by
deliberately inducing disorder which causes the system to localize. In this
work, we explore the potential of using an $XZX$ cluster Hamiltonian to encode
quantum information into the local edge modes and comprehensively investigate
the influence of both many-body interactions and disorder on their stability
over time, adding substance to the narrative that many-body localization may
stabilize quantum information. We recover the edge state at each time step,
allowing us to reconstruct the quantum channel that captures the locally
constrained out of equilibrium time evolution. With this representation in
hand, we analyze how well classical and quantum information are preserved over
time as a function of disorder and interactions. We find that the performance
of the edge qubits varies dramatically between disorder realizations. Whereas
some show a smooth decoherence over time, a sizeable fraction are rapidly
rendered unusable as memories. We also find that the stability of the classical
information -- a precursor for the usefulness of the chain as a quantum memory
-- depends strongly on the direction in which the bit is encoded. When
employing the chain as a genuine quantum memory, encoded qubits are most
faithfully recovered for low interaction and high disorder.

host star ambiguity, and in some cases are the source of false-positive transit

the 117 systems with resolved companions due to photometric contamination. The
contamination in TESS due to close binaries is similar to that found in surveys

100 AU among planet candidate hosts (44 observed binaries compared to 124

$C(x,\sigma)$ giving the measure for closed quantum loops of length $\sigma$

well-defined and depend only on the geometry of the spacetime. Various other
physical quantities like, for e.g., the effective Lagrangian, can be expressed
in terms of $N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$. The corresponding measure for the total path
length contributed by the closed loops, in a spacetime region $\mathcal{V}$, is
given by the integral of $L(\sigma;x) \equiv\sigma C(\sigma;x)$ over
$\mathcal{V}$. Remarkably enough $L(0;x) \propto R(x)$, the Ricci scalar; i.e,
the measure for the total length contributed by infinitesimal closed loops in a
region of spacetime gives us the Einstein-Hilbert action. Its variation, when
we vary the metric, can provide a new route towards induced/emergent gravity
descriptions. In the presence of a background electromagnetic field, the
corresponding expressions for $N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$ and $C(x,\sigma)$ can be
related to the holonomies of the field. The measure $N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$ can
also be used to evaluate a wide class of path integrals for which the action
and the measure are arbitrary functions of the path length. As an example, I
compute a modified path integral which incorporates the zero-point-length in
the spacetime. I also describe several other properties of $N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$

statistical procedure---referred to as Non-Poissonian Template Fitting
(NPTF)---that distinguishes the smooth distribution of photons expected for
dark matter annihilation from a ""clumpy"" photon distribution expected for point
sources. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of the NPTF on simulated
data, exploring its ability to recover the flux and luminosity function of
unresolved sources at the Galactic Center. When astrophysical background
emission is perfectly modeled, we find that the NPTF successfully distinguishes
between the dark matter and point source hypotheses when either component makes
up the entirety of the GCE. When the GCE is a mixture of dark matter and point
sources, the NPTF may fail to reconstruct the correct contribution of each
component. We further study the impact of mismodeling the Galactic diffuse
backgrounds, finding that while a dark matter signal could be attributed to
point sources in some outlying cases for the scenarios we consider, the
significance of a true point source signal remains robust. Our work enables us
to comment on a recent study by Leane and Slatyer (2019) that questions prior
NPTF conclusions because the method does not recover an artificial dark matter
signal injected on actual Fermi data. We demonstrate that the failure of the
NPTF to extract an artificial dark matter signal can be natural when point
sources are present in the data---with the effect further exacerbated by the
presence of diffuse mismodeling---and does not on its own invalidate the
conclusions of the NPTF analysis in the Inner Galaxy.

the initial grain size distribution is narrow with radii around ~10 - 50 nm for
high gas densities, or with radii around ~0.5 - 1.5 ${\mu}$m for low and medium
gas densities. Silicate grains with initial radii around 10 - 30 nm show
survival rates of up to 40 % for medium and high density contrasts, while
silicate material with micron sized distributions is mostly destroyed. For both
materials, the surviving dust mass is rearranged into a new size distribution
that can be approximated by two components: a power-law distribution of small
grains and a log-normal distribution of grains having the same size range as
the initial distribution. Our results show that grain-grain collisions and
sputtering are synergistic and that grain-grain collisions can play a crucial

this behavior {\it ferromagnetic mesoscopic magnetization}. Hence, in the
antiferromagnetic regime, our results show an unexpected dependence of a local,

extended to non-equilibrium states, which are interesting both because they
exhibit new physical phenomena and because of their potential for high-speed
device applications. Notable advances have been made in the creation of
metastable phases and in Floquet engineering under external periodic driving.
In the context of non-equilibrium superconductivity, examples have included the
generation of transient superconductivity above the thermodynamic transition
temperature, the excitation of coherent Higgs mode oscillations, and the
optical control of the interlayer phase in cuprates. Here, we propose
theoretically a novel non-equilibrium phenomenon, through which a prompt quench
from a metal to a transient superconducting state could induce large
oscillations of the order parameter amplitude. We argue that this oscillating
mode could act as a source of parametric amplification of the incident
radiation. We report experimental results on optically driven K$_3$C$_{60}$
that are consistent with these predictions. The effect is found to disappear
when the onset of the excitation becomes slower than the Higgs mode period,
consistent with the theory proposed here. These results open new possibilities
for the use of collective modes in many-body systems to induce non-linear
optical effects.

MPS closest to the one-step correction of the Lanczos or Jacobi-Davidson

around supermassive black holes. The neutrinos are produced by the decay of
charged pions originating in ultrarelativistic protons that are accelerated
there. In the standard theory of tidal disruption events (TDEs), there are four
distinct phases from debris circularization of stellar debris to super- and
sub-Eddington to radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). In addition,
we consider the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state in both the
super-Eddington accretion and RIAF phases. We find that there are three
promising cases to produce neutrino emissions: the super-Eddington accretion
phase of the MAD state and the RIAF phases of both the non-MAD and MAD states.
In the super-Eddington MAD state, the enhanced magnetic field makes it possible
to accelerate the protons to $E_{p,max}~0.35 PeV
(M_bh/10^{7.7}M_\odot)^{41/48}$ with the other given appropriate parameters.
The neutrino energy is then $E_{\nu,pk}~67 TeV (M_bh/10^{7.7}M_\odot)^{41/48}$
at the peak of the energy spectrum. For $M_bh\gtrsim10^{7.7} M_\odot$, the
neutrino light curve is proportional to $t^{-65/24}$, while it follows the
standard $t^{-5/3}$ decay rate for $M_bh<10^{7.7} M_\odot$. In both cases, the
large luminosity and characteristic light curves diagnose the super-Eddington
MAD state in TDEs. In the RIAF phase of the non-MAD state, we find $E_{p,
max}~0.45 PeV (M_bh/10^7M_\odot)^{5/3}$ and $E_{\nu,pk}~0.35 PeV
(M_bh/10^7M_\odot)^{5/3}$, and its light curve is proportional to $t^{-10/3}$.
This indicates that one can identify whether the existing RIAFs are the TDE
origin or not. TDRs are potentially a population of hidden neutrino sources
invisible in gamma rays.

parse trees that result are often devoid of the detail that the BNF was

modeled using graphical Markov channels with input-modulated transition rates.
Such channel models are strongly non-Gaussian. In this paper we use a linear
noise approximation to construct a novel class of Gaussian additive white noise
channels that capture essential features of fully- and partially-observed
intensity-driven signal transduction. When channel state transitions that are
sensitive to the input signal are directly observable, high-frequency
information is transduced more efficiently than low-frequency information, and
the mutual information rate per bandwidth (spectral efficiency) is
significantly greater than when sensitive transitions and observable
transitions are disjoint. When both observable and hidden transitions are
input-sensitive, we observe a superadditive increase in spectral efficiency.

our understanding of planetary climate and chemistry. They also represent one
of the greater challenges to overcome when trying to interpret transit
transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres as their presence can inhibit
precise constraints on atmospheric composition and thermal properties. In this
work we take a phenomenological approach towards understanding 1) our ability
to constrain bulk cloud properties, and 2) the impact of clouds on constraining
various atmospheric properties as obtained through transmission spectroscopy
with the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)}. We do this by exploring
retrievals of atmospheric and cloud properties for a generic ""hot-Jupiter"" as a
function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), \textit{JWST} observing modes and four
different cloud parameterizations. We find that most key atmospheric and cloud
inferences can be well constrained in the wavelength range ($\lambda = $ 0.6 -
11 $\mu$m), with NIRCam ($\lambda =$ 2.5 - 5 $\mu$m) being critical in
inferring atmospheric properties and NIRISS + MIRI ($\lambda =$ 0.6 - 2.5, 5 -
11 $\mu$m) being necessary for good constraints on cloud parameters. However,
constraining the cloud abundance and therefore the total cloud mass requires an
observable cloud base in the transit geometry. While higher SNR observations
can place tighter constraints on major parameters such as temperature,
metallicity and cloud sedimentation, they are unable to eliminate strong
degeneracies among cloud parameters. Our investigation of a generic
""warm-Neptune"" with photochemical haze parameterization also shows promising
results in constraining atmospheric and haze properties in the cooler

applications. Up to now, a number of experimental studies have identified
correlations between tribological parameters and the mechanical response. Using
molecular dynamics simulations, we study abrasive wear behavior via
nanoscratching of a Cu$_{64.5}$Zr$_{35.5}$ metallic glass. The evolution of the
normal and transverse forces and hardness values follows the behavior well
known for crystalline substrates. In particular, the generation of the frontal
pileup weakens the response of the material to the scratching tip and leads to
a decrease of the transverse hardness as compared to the normal hardness.
However, metallic glasses soften with increasing temperature, particularly
above the glass transition temperature thus showing a higher tendency to
structurally relax an applied stress. This plastic response is analyzed
focusing on local regions of atoms which underwent strong von-Mises strains,
since these are the basis of shear-transformation zones and shear bands. The
volume occupied by these atoms increases with temperature, but large increases
are only observed above the glass transition temperature. We quantify the
generation of plasticity by the concept of plastic efficiency, which relates
the generation of plastic volume inside the sample with the formation of
external damage, viz. the scratch groove. In comparison to nanoindentation, the
generation rate of the plastic volume during nanoscratching is significantly
temperature dependent making the glass inside more damage-tolerant at lower
temperature but more damage-susceptible at elevated temperatures.

say that $\mathcal I$ and $\mathcal J$ are incompatible if $\mathcal I \cup
\mathcal J$ does not generate a proper ideal. Equivalently, $\mathcal I$ and
$\mathcal J$ are incompatible if there is some $A \subseteq X$ such that $A \in
\mathcal I$ and $X \setminus A \in \mathcal J$. If some $B \subseteq X$ is
either in $\mathcal I \setminus \mathcal J$ or in $\mathcal J \setminus
\mathcal I$, then we say that $B$ chooses between $\mathcal I$ and $\mathcal
J$.
  We consider the following Ramsey-theoretic problem: Given several pairs
$(\mathcal I_1,\mathcal J_1), (\mathcal I_2,\mathcal J_2), \dots, (\mathcal
I_k,\mathcal J_k)$ of incompatible ideals on a set $X$, find some $A \subseteq
X$ that chooses between as many of these pairs of ideals as possible. The main
theorem is that for every $n \in \mathbb N$, there is some $I(n) \in \mathbb N$
such that given at least $I(n)$ pairs of incompatible ideals on any set $X$,
there is some $A \subseteq X$ choosing between at least $n$ of them. This
theorem is proved in two main steps. The first step is to identify a (purely
finitary) problem in extremal combinatorics, and to show that our problem
concerning ideals is equivalent to this combinatorial problem. The second step
is to analyze the combinatorial problem in order to show that the number $I(n)$
described above exists, and to put bounds on it. We show $\textstyle
\frac{1}{2}n \log_2 n - O(n) \,<\, I(n) \,<\, n \ln n + O(n).$ The upper bound
is proved by considering a different but closely related combinatorial problem
involving hypergraphs, which may be of independent interest. We also
investigate some applications of this theorem to a problem concerning
conditionally convergent series.

includes a double degenerate system containing two magnetic white dwarfs and/or
rotational modulation of a complex magnetic field structure. Here we present
time-resolved spectroscopy of G183$-$35 obtained at the Gemini Observatory.
These data reveal two sets of absorption lines that appear and disappear over a
period of about 4 hours. We also detect low-level (0.2%) variability in optical
photometry at the same period. We demonstrate that the spectroscopic and
photometric variability can be explained by the presence of spots on the
surface of the white dwarf and a change in the average field strength from
about 4.6 MG to 6.2 MG. The observed variability is clearly due to G183$-$35's
relatively short spin period. However, rotational modulation of a complex
magnetic field by itself cannot explain the changes seen in the central
H$\alpha$ component. An additional source of variability in the line profiles,
most likely due to a chemically inhomogeneous surface composition, is also
needed. We propose further observations of similar objects to test this

comprehension model, we propose a spatial comprehension model that is able to
recognize the meaning of spatial entities based on the semantics of the

then injected to the natural language question to ease the burden of capturing
the spatial-specific semantics. With our spatial comprehension model and
information injection, our NLI for the spatial domain, named SpatialNLI, is
able to capture the semantic structure of the question and translate it to the
corresponding syntax of an executable query accurately. We also experimentally
ascertain that SpatialNLI outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

as controllers, the ultimate goal of training processes can be formulated as an
optimal control problem. In addition, we can reveal convergence and
generalization properties by studying the stochastic dynamics of optimization
algorithms. This viewpoint features a wide range of theoretical study from
information bottleneck to statistical physics. It also provides a principled
way for hyper-parameter tuning when optimal control theory is introduced. Our

neuroimaging, including across operating system versions, minor noise
injections, and implementation of theoretically equivalent algorithms. In this
paper we explore the effect of various perturbation methods on a typical
neuroimaging pipeline through the use of i) targeted noise injections, ii)
Monte Carlo Arithmetic, and iii) varying operating systems to identify the
quality and severity of their impact. The work presented here demonstrates that
even low order computational models such as the connectome estimation pipeline
that we used are susceptible to noise. This suggests that stability is a
relevant axis upon which tools should be compared, developed, or improved,
alongside more commonly considered axes such as accuracy/biological feasibility
or performance. The heterogeneity observed across participants clearly
illustrates that stability is a property of not just the data or tools
independently, but their interaction. Characterization of stability should
therefore be evaluated for specific analyses and performed on a representative
set of subjects for consideration in subsequent statistical testing.
Additionally, identifying how this relationship scales to higher-order models
is an exciting next step which will be explored. Finally, the joint application
of perturbation methods with post-processing approaches such as bagging or
signal normalization may lead to the development of more numerically stable
analyses while maintaining sensitivity to meaningful variation.

construct reduced-order models (ROMs) for reactive-transport quantities of
interest (QoIs) based on high-fidelity numerical simulations. QoIs include
species decay, product yield, and degree of mixing. The ROMs for QoIs are
applied to quantify and understand how the chemical species evolve over time.
First, high-resolution datasets for constructing ROMs are generated by solving
anisotropic reaction-diffusion equations using a non-negative finite element
formulation for different input parameters. Non-negative finite element
formulation ensures that the species concentration is non-negative (which is
needed for computing QoIs) on coarse computational grids even under high
anisotropy. The reactive-mixing model input parameters are a time-scale
associated with flipping of velocity, a spatial-scale controlling small/large
vortex structures of velocity, a perturbation parameter of the vortex-based
velocity, anisotropic dispersion strength/contrast, and molecular diffusion.
Second, random forests, F-test, and mutual information criterion are used to
evaluate the importance of model inputs/features with respect to QoIs. Third,
Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are used to
construct ROMs based on the model inputs. Then, SVR-ROMs are used to predict
scaling of QoIs. Qualitatively, SVR-ROMs are able to describe the trends
observed in the scaling law associated with QoIs. Fourth, the scaling law's
exponent dependence on model inputs/features are evaluated using $k$-means
clustering. Finally, in terms of the computational cost, the proposed SVM-ROMs

efficiently leverage information present in different layers of the network.
Specifically, we present a network that involves: (i) a multi-level bottom-top
and top-bottom fusion (MBTTBF) method to combine information from shallower to
deeper layers and vice versa at multiple levels, (ii) scale complementary
feature extraction blocks (SCFB) involving cross-scale residual functions to
explicitly enable flow of complementary features from adjacent conv layers
along the fusion paths. Furthermore, in order to increase the effectiveness of
the multi-scale fusion, we employ a principled way of generating scale-aware
ground-truth density maps for training. Experiments conducted on three datasets
that contain highly congested scenes (ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, and UCF-QNRF)
demonstrate that the proposed method is able to outperform several recent
methods in all the datasets.

quantum many-body systems by restricting to a neighbourhood of active orbitals
around the Fermi level. The respective wavefunction ansatzes which involve all
possible electron configurations of active orbitals can be characterized by the
saturation of a certain number of Pauli constraints $0 \leq n_i \leq 1$,
identifying the occupied core orbitals ($n_i=1$) and the inactive virtual
orbitals ($n_j=0$). In Part I, we generalize this crucial concept of active
spaces by referring to the generalized Pauli constraints. To be more specific,
we explain and illustrate that the saturation of any such constraint on
fermionic occupation numbers characterizes a distinctive set of active electron
configurations. A converse form of this selection rule establishes the basis
for corresponding multiconfigurational wavefunction ansatzes. In Part II, we
provide rigorous derivations of those findings. Moroever, we extend our results
to non-fermionic multipartite quantum systems, revealing that extremal
single-body information has always strong implications for the multipartite
quantum state. In that sense, our work also confirms that pinned quantum
systems define new physical entities and the presence of pinnings reflect the
existence of (possibly hidden) ground state symmetries.

information content and complementarity of the following three electroweak
experiments in constraining the neutron distribution of atomic nuclei: (a)
parity violating elastic electron scattering, (b) coherent elastic neutrino
nucleus scattering, and (c) elastic electron scattering of unstable nuclei.
Relativistic mean-field models informed by the properties of finite nuclei and
neutron stars are used to compute ground state densities and form factors of a
variety of nuclei. All the models follow the same fitting protocol, except for
the assumed and presently unknown value of the neutron skin thickness of 208Pb.
This enables one to tune the density dependence of the symmetry energy without
compromising the success in reproducing well known physical observables. We
found that the ongoing PREX-II and upcoming CREX campaigns at Jefferson Lab
will play a vital role in constraining the weak form factor of xenon and argon,
liquid noble gases that are used for the detection of both neutrinos and dark
matter particles. We concluded that remarkable new advances in experimental
physics have opened a new window into ground state densities of atomic nuclei

experiments reveal powerful correlations that impose important nuclear
structure constraints. In turn, these constraints provide quantitative
theoretical uncertainties that are instrumental in searches for new physics and

Alternatively, the assumption on the injectivity radii can be replaced with the
request of a controlled growth of the full curvature tensor at order $0$. The
control in the assumptions occur via non-necessarily polynomial growth
functions. This construction largely extend previously known results in various
directions, permitting to obtain consequences which are (in a sense) sharp.
  A first main application is to the study of the density property for Sobolev

of smooth compactly supported function in the Sobolev space $W^{k,p}$. Contrary
to all previously known results this can be obtained also on manifolds with
possibly unbounded geometry.

Lichnerowicz Laplacian acting on the space of smooth section of the bundle of
$k$-covariant symmetric tensors, we can weaken the assumptions needed to obtain
the density property. Namely we prove that the control on the highest order
derivative of curvature is not needed in this situation.

recurring motifs in signals with spatial or temporal structure. Variants of
this problem arise in applications such as image deblurring, microscopy, neural
spike sorting, and more. The problem is challenging in both theory and
practice, as natural optimization formulations are nonconvex. Moreover,
practical deconvolution problems involve smooth motifs (kernels) whose spectra
decay rapidly, resulting in poor conditioning and numerical challenges. This
paper is motivated by recent theoretical advances, which characterize the
optimization landscape of a particular nonconvex formulation of SaSD. This is
used to derive a $provable$ algorithm which exactly solves certain

this theory (sphere constraints, data-driven initialization) to develop a
$practical$ algorithm, which performs well on data arising from a range of

spectroscopy only work for doping levels higher than ~10^12 cm^-2. Here, we
propose an optical method using Raman 2D peak-splitting (split between the
Raman 2D1 and 2D2 peaks at low doping levels). Electrostatically gated Raman
measurements combined with transport measurements were used to correlate the 2D
peak-split with the charge density on graphene with high precision (2x10^10
cm^-2 per 2D peak-split wavenumber). We found that the Raman 2D peak-split has
a strong correlation with the charge density at low doping levels, and that a
lower charge density results in a larger 2D peak-split. Our work provides a
simple and non-invasive optical method to quantify the doping level of graphene
from 10^10 cm^-2 to 10^12 cm^-2, two orders of magnitude higher precision than
previously reported optical methods. This method provides a platform for
estimating the doping level and quality of graphene before fabricating graphene

yet generating two planets with widely different tilts and strikingly similar
spin rates is a low-probability event. Trapping into a secular spin-orbit
resonance, a coupling between spin and orbit precession frequencies, is a
promising alternative, as it can tilt the planet without altering its spin
period. We show with numerical integrations that if Uranus harbored a massive
circumplanetary disk at least three times the mass of its satellite system
while it was accreting its gaseous atmosphere, then its spin precession rate
would increase enough to resonate with its own orbit, potentially driving the
planet's obliquity to 70${^\circ}$. We find that the presence of a massive disk
moves the Laplace radius significantly outward from its classical value,
resulting in more of the disk contributing to the planet's pole precession.
Although we can generate tilts greater than 70${^\circ}$ only rarely and cannot
drive tilts beyond 90${^\circ}$, a subsequent collision with an object about
$0.5\,M_{\oplus}$ could tilt Uranus from 70${^\circ}$ to 98${^\circ}$.
Minimizing the masses and number of giant impactors from two or more to just
one increases the likelihood of producing Uranus's spin states by about an
order of magnitude. Neptune, by contrast, needs a less massive disk to explain
its 30${^\circ}$ tilt, eliminating the need for giant collisions altogether.

data and the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog are used. From the composite map of
velocity distribution of 'neighbor' galaxies within 15 Mpc from the CALIFA
galaxies, the composite radial profiles of the luminosity-weighted mean
velocity of neighbors are derived. These profiles show unexpectedly strong
evidence of the dynamical coherence between the rotation of the CALIFA galaxies
and the average line-of-sight motion of their neighbors within several Mpc
distances. Such a signal is particularly strong when the neighbors are limited
to red ones: the luminosity-weighted mean velocity at 1 < D <= 6 Mpc is as
large as 30.6+/-10.9 km/s (2.8-sigma significance to random spin-axis
uncertainty) for central rotation (R <= Re). In the comparison of several
subsamples, the dynamical coherence tends to be marginally stronger for the
diffuse or kinematically-well-aligned CALIFA galaxies. For this mysterious

Hofstadter butterfly there appears a wide gap around the $\pi$ flux, which
belongs to the same HOTI discovered by Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH). It
turns out that in a weak field regime HOTI could exist even within a small gap
disconnected from the wider gap around $\pi$ flux. To characterize HOTI, we
employ the entanglement polarization (eP) technique which is useful even if the
basic four bands split into many Landau levels under a magnetic field.

with a series of foreseeable advances in the characterization of the stellar
content of the Milky Way. The Gaia mission, combined with large-scale
spectroscopic surveys, is helping to build an unprecedented census in terms of
the astrometric, kinematic and chemical properties of Galactic stellar
populations. Within a decade, precise measurements of such properties will be
available for hundreds of millions of stars. Meanwhile, time-domain surveys
initiated with CoRoT and Kepler/K2 and carried on by space missions such as
TESS and PLATO or ground-based projects like the LSST, will have brought
asteroseismology to a high level of maturity. The combination of precise ages
from asteroseismology with astrometric and spectroscopic data, on large stellar
samples, is allowing Galactic archaeologists to gain new insight into the
assembly history of the Milky Way. Recent breakthroughs --- based on the
detection of solar-like oscillations in tens of thousands of red-giant stars
--- demonstrate the potential of such approach. Therefore, we are convinced
that an all-sky, high-cadence, long-duration stellar variability survey will
become a scientific priority in the 2035-50 period. The Chronos concept
presented here consists in a time-domain extension to Gaia. It will allow for
mass and age estimates for half a million red giants within 1.7 kpc from the
Sun and hence shed a new light on our understanding of the Galactic dynamics
and archaeology. In terms of the targeted pulsators, Chronos will bridge the
gap between PLATO and the LSST by surveying stars all the way from the subgiant
branch to the early AGB. Finally, it will surpass all previous surveys capable
of conducting asteroseismology in terms of the combined sky coverage and
duration of the observations (2 x 3.75 months over the whole sky and >5 years
in the CVZ).

operating or transmission data rate for each user. However, under channel
uncertainty, higher transmission rates cause higher outage probability, and the
delivered rate drops. Since lower rates are not desirable, one must balance
between the transmission rate and outage. In this paper, we first explain how
approximating the PDF of a quadratic form with a positive definite matrix can
be used to obtain the outage probability for any set of beamfomers and
transmission rate. Then we focus on the specific case of maximizing the minimum
delivered rate, where we modify a robust beamforming approach to maximize the

power systems is to mimic generation response using grid-connected inverters to
restore the grid's stiffness. In this paper, we seek to challenge this approach
and advocate for a principled design based on a systematic analysis of the
performance trade-offs of inverter-based frequency control. With this aim, we
perform a qualitative and quantitative study comparing the effect of
conventional control strategies --droop control (DC) and virtual inertia (VI)--
on several performance metrics induced by $\mathcal L_2$ and $\mathcal
L_\infty$ signal norms. By extending a recently proposed modal decomposition
method, we capture the effect of step and stochastic power disturbances, and
frequency measurement noise, on the overall transient and steady-state behavior
of the system. Our analysis unveils several limitations of these solutions,
such as the inability of DC to improve dynamic frequency response without
increasing steady-state control effort, or the large frequency variance that VI
introduces in the presence of measurement noise. We further propose a novel
dynam-i-c Droop controller (iDroop) that overcomes the limitations of DC and
VI. More precisely, we show that iDroop can be tuned to achieve high noise
rejection, fast system-wide synchronization, or frequency overshoot (Nadir)
elimination without affecting the steady-state control effort share, and
propose a tuning recommendation that strikes a balance among these objectives.
Extensive numerical experimentation shows that the proposed tuning is effective
even when our proportionality assumptions are not valid, and that the
particular tuning used for Nadir elimination strikes a good trade-off among
various performance metrics.

this is unlike the biomimetic scenario of catalysis through direct host-guest

sensitivity to electric field projections onto the breaking carbon bonds to
complete the reductive elimination reaction with greater catalytic efficiency.

  MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS)","40 pages, 11 figures, 1 table",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: To acquire the real-time interactive temperature map for aqueous and
adipose tissue, the problems of long acquisition and processing time must be
addressed. To overcome these major challenges, this paper proposes a cascaded
convolutional neural network (CNN) framework and multi-echo gradient echo
(meGRE) with a single reference variable flip angle (srVFA).
  Methods: To optimize the echo times for each method, MR images are acquired
using a meGRE sequence; meGRE images with two flip angles (FAs) and meGRE
images with a single FA are acquired during the pretreatment and treatment
stages, respectively. These images are then processed and reconstructed by a
cascaded CNN, which consists of two CNNs. The first CNN (called DeepACCnet)
performs HR complex MR image reconstruction from the LR MR image acquired
during the treatment stage, which is improved by the HR magnitude MR image
acquired during the pretreatment stage. The second CNN (called DeepPROCnet)
copes with T1 mapping.
  Results: Measurements of temperature and T1 changes obtained by meGRE
combined with srVFA and cascaded CNNs were achieved in an agarose gel phantom,
ex vivo porcine muscle, and ex vivo porcine muscle with fat layers (heating
tests), and in vivo human prostate and brain (non-heating tests). In the
heating test, the maximum differences between fiber-optic sensor and samples
are less than 1 degree Celcius. In all cases, temperature mapping using the
cascaded CNN achieved the best results in all cases. The acquisition and
processing times for the proposed method are 0.8 s and 32 ms, respectively.
  Conclusions: Real-time interactive HR MR temperature mapping for
simultaneously measuring aqueous and adipose tissue is feasible by combining a
cascaded CNN with meGRE and srVFA.

unsolved problem in generative adversarial networks (GANs).In this paper, we
present spectral regularization for GANs (SR-GANs), a new and robust method for
combating the mode collapse problem in GANs. Theoretical analysis shows that
the optimal solution to the discriminator has a strong relationship to the
spectral distributions of the weight matrix.Therefore, we monitor the spectral
distribution in the discriminator of spectral normalized GANs (SN-GANs), and
discover a phenomenon which we refer to as spectral collapse, where a large
number of singular values of the weight matrices drop dramatically when mode
collapse occurs. We show that there are strong evidence linking mode collapse
to spectral collapse; and based on this link, we set out to tackle spectral
collapse as a surrogate of mode collapse. We have developed a spectral
regularization method where we compensate the spectral distributions of the
weight matrices to prevent them from collapsing, which in turn successfully
prevents mode collapse in GANs. We provide theoretical explanations for why
SR-GANs are more stable and can provide better performances than SN-GANs. We
also present extensive experimental results and analysis to show that SR-GANs
not only always outperform SN-GANs but also always succeed in combating mode
collapse where SN-GANs fail. The code is available at

characterizing the chemical composition of the various uncertainties, including
baseline shift and multiplicative error. This study aims at analyzing the
effect of certain treatment on the FTIR responses subject to these
uncertainties. A two-step method is proposed to quantify the treatment effect
on the FTIR signals. First, an optimization problem is solved to calculate the
template signal by aligning the pre-treatment FTIR signals. Second, the effect
of treatment is decomposed as the pattern of modification $\mathbf{g}$ that
describes the overall treatment effect on the spectra and a vector of effect
$\boldsymbol{\delta}$ that describes the degree of modification. $\mathbf g$
and $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ are solved by another optimization problem. They have
explicit engineering interpretations and provide useful information on how the
treatment effect change the surface chemical components. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is first validated in a simulation. In a real case study,
it's used to investigate how the plasma exposure applied at various heights
affects the FTIR signal which indicates the change of the chemical composition
on the composite material. The vector of effects indicates the range of
effective plasma height, and the pattern of modification matches existing
engineering knowledge well.

In this paper, we study whether some basic properties in Tutte's flow theory
remain valid for this family of signed graphs. Specifically let $(G,\sigma)$ be
a flow-admissible signed graph without long barbells. We show that it admits a
nowhere-zero $6$-flow and that it admits a nowhere-zero modulo $k$-flow if and

spectrally-hyperviscous Navier-Stokes equations (SHNSE) on general bounded
domains \Omega with zero (no-slip) boundary conditions prescribed on
\varGamma=\partial\varOmega. Previous successful studies of the SHNSE have been
limited to periodic-box domains. There are significant theoretical obstacles to
overcome in extending the SHNSE beyond this case. We solve them with the help
of the Helmholtz decomposition, and with our new formulation of the SHNSE on
general bounded domains in hand we then establish foundational results,
beginning with the existence of globally regular solutions. Given that the
SHNSE is meant to approximate the NSE for small \mu or large m, we establish
this rigorously in the general case by adapting the weak subsequence
convergence results of [5] to hold here. On intervals [0,T] with a common
H^{1}-bound we deepen this sense of approximation by obtaining strong
convergence. First, by using estimates depending only on the common H^{1}-bound
to maximize computational applicability we show that SHNSE solutions converge
uniformly in H^{1} to the NSE solution as either \mu\rightarrow0 or
m\rightarrow\infty. Then in cases in which bootstrapped higher-order bounds can
be readily used we show that higher-order convergence results hold. Our final
results use the Stokes-pressure methodology developed in [29], [30] to recast
the SHNSE in a form which like the NSE reformulation in [29], [30] is more
adaptable to computation and the specification of boundary values for the
pressure.

source as a passive illuminator of opportunity (IO) and a co-channel active
radar transmitter operating in the same frequency band to seek spectral
efficiency. The hybrid system can take advantage of the strengths of passive
radar (e.g., energy efficiency, bi-/multi-static configuration, and spatial
diversity) as well as those of active radar (dedicated transmitter, flexible
transmit beam steering, waveform optimized for sensing, etc.). To mitigate the
mutual interference and location-induced timing uncertainty between the radar
and communication signals, we propose two designs for the joint optimization of
the radar waveform and receive filters. The first is a max-min (MM) criterion
that optimizes a worst-case performance metric over a timing uncertainty
interval, and the other a weighted-sum (WS) criterion that forms a weighted sum
of the performance metric at each delay within the delay uncertainty interval.
Both design criteria result in nonconvex constrained optimization problems that
are solved by sequential convex programming methods. When timing uncertainty
vanishes, the two designs become identical and admit a simpler solution.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
hybrid schemes in comparison with conventional active-only and passive-only
radar systems.

healthcare. In medical crowdfunding, online platforms allow individuals to
appeal to social networks to request donations for health and medical needs.
Users are often told that success depends on how they organize and share their
campaigns to increase social network engagement. However, experts have
cautioned that MCF could exacerbate health and social disparities by amplifying
the choices and biases of the crowd and leveraging these to determine who has
access to financial support for healthcare. To date, research on potential axes
of disparity in MCF, and their impacts on fundraising outcomes, has been
limited. This paper presents an exploratory cross-sectional study of a
randomized sample of 637 MCF campaigns on the popular platform Gofundme, for
which the race, gender, age, and relationships of campaigners and campaign
recipients were categorized alongside campaign characteristics and outcomes.
Our analyses examine race, gender, and age disparities in MCF use, and tests
how these are associated with differential campaign outcomes. The results show
systemic disparities in MCF use and outcomes: non-white users are
under-represented. There is significant evidence of an additional digital care
labor burden on women organizers of campaigns, and marginalized race and gender
groups are associated with poorer fundraising outcomes. Outcomes are only
minimally associated with campaign characteristics under users' control, such
as photos, videos, and updates. These results corroborate widespread concerns
how technology fuels health inequities, and about how crowdfunding may be
creating an unequal and biased marketplace for those seeking financial support
to access healthcare. Further research and better data access are needed to
explore these dynamics more deeply and inform policy for this largely
unregulated industry.

field-of-view. LBTI can operate in this mode at wavelengths of 1.2 to 5 and 8

imaging of circumstellar disks, evolved stars, solar system objects, and
possibly searches for planets, in the thermal infrared. Over the past five
years, LBTI has carried out a considerable number of interferometric
observations by combining the beams near a pupil plane to carry out nulling
interferometry. This mode is useful for measuring small luminosity level
offsets, such as those of exozodiacal dust disks. The Fizeau mode, by contrast,
is more useful for generating an image of the target because it has more (u, v)

control, increased automation, and the removal of non-common-path aberrations
(NCPA) between the science and phase beams. This increased level of control
will increase the fringe contrast, enable longer integrations, and reduce time

the pre-trained network requires high computation capability and large-scale
labeled dataset. To mitigate the burden of large-scale labeling, learning in
un/self-supervised manner can be a solution. In addition, using unsupervised
multi-task learning, a generalized feature representation can be learned.
However, unsupervised multi-task learning can be biased to a specific task. To
overcome this problem, we propose the metric-based regularization term and
temporal task ensemble (TTE) for multi-task learning. Since these two
techniques prevent the entire network from learning in a state deviated to a
specific task, it is possible to learn a generalized feature representation
that appropriately reflects the characteristics of each task without biasing.
Experimental results for three target tasks such as classification, object
detection and embedding clustering prove that the TTE-based multi-task

still challenging in 3D shape analysis and understanding. Recent studies
usually involve three steps: first splitting a point cloud into some local
regions, then extracting corresponding feature of each local region, and
finally aggregating all individual local region features into a global feature
as shape representation using simple max pooling. However, such pooling-based
feature aggregation methods do not adequately take the spatial relationships
between local regions into account, which greatly limits the ability to learn
discriminative shape representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel
deep learning network, named Point2SpatialCapsule, for aggregating features and
spatial relationships of local regions on point clouds, which aims to learn
more discriminative shape representation. Compared with traditional max-pooling
based feature aggregation networks, Point2SpatialCapsule can explicitly learn
not only geometric features of local regions but also spatial relationships
among them. It consists of two modules. To resolve the disorder problem of
local regions, the first module, named geometric feature aggregation, is
designed to aggregate the local region features into the learnable cluster
centers, which explicitly encodes the spatial locations from the original 3D
space. The second module, named spatial relationship aggregation, is proposed
for further aggregating clustered features and the spatial relationships among
them in the feature space using the spatial-aware capsules developed in this
paper. Compared to the previous capsule network based methods, the feature
routing on the spatial-aware capsules can learn more discriminative spatial
relationships among local regions for point clouds, which establishes a direct
mapping between log priors and the spatial locations through feature clusters.

  Networks: A Competitive Market Approach",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the problem of user association and resource allocation is
studied for an integrated satellite-drone network (ISDN). In the considered
model, drone base stations (DBSs) provide downlink connectivity,
supplementally, to ground users whose demand cannot be satisfied by terrestrial
small cell base stations (SBSs). Meanwhile, a satellite system and a set of
terrestrial macrocell base stations (MBSs) are used to provide resources for
backhaul connectivity for both DBSs and SBSs. For this scenario, one must
jointly consider resource management over satellite-DBS/SBS backhaul links,
MBS-DBS/SBS terrestrial backhaul links, and DBS/SBS-user radio access links as
well as user association with DBSs and SBSs. This joint user association and
resource allocation problem is modeled using a competitive market setting in
which the transmission data is considered as a good that is being exchanged
between users, DBSs, and SBSs that act as ""buyers"", and DBSs, SBSs, MBSs, and
the satellite that act as ""sellers"". In this market, the quality-of-service
(QoS) is used to capture the quality of the data transmission (defined as
good), while the energy consumption the buyers use for data transmission is the
cost of exchanging a good. According to the quality of goods, sellers in the
market propose quotations to the buyers to sell their goods, while the buyers
purchase the goods based on the quotation. The buyers profit from the
difference between the earned QoS and the charged price, while the sellers
profit from the difference between earned price and the energy spent for data
transmission. The buyers and sellers in the market seek to reach a Walrasian
equilibrium, at which all the goods are sold, and each of the devices' profit
is maximized. A heavy ball based iterative algorithm is proposed to compute the
Walrasian equilibrium of the formulated market.

parameter $\gamma> 0$ are considered: $T_\gamma = \ln^{-\gamma} (e+|\nabla|)$
and $T_\gamma = \ln^{-\gamma} (e-\Delta)$. These models regularize the 2D Euler
equation for the vorticity (conventionally corresponding to the $\gamma=0$

allow pretraining on predicted shallow syntactic parses, instead of just raw
text, so that contextual embeddings make use of shallow syntactic context. Our
second method involves shallow syntactic features obtained automatically on
downstream task data. Neither approach leads to a significant gain on any of
the four downstream tasks we considered relative to ELMo-only baselines.
Further analysis using black-box probes confirms that our shallow-syntax-aware
contextual embeddings do not transfer to linguistic tasks any more easily than
ELMo's embeddings. We take these findings as evidence that ELMo-style
pretraining discovers representations which make additional awareness of
shallow syntax redundant.

of the recommender system as a whole e.g., by their ability to recommend

which is a key stage in content-driven RS is barely properly evaluated due to
the lack of publicly available datasets that contain user preferences on

  To raise awareness of this fact, we investigate differences between explicit

preferences towards content features of movies, which we release publicly. We
then compare the collected explicit user feature preferences and implicit user
profiles built via state-of-the-art user profiling models. Our results show a

sequences in a Hilbert space. In 2007, P. Balazs \cite{BALAZS3} generalized
this by replacing $\{x_n\}_n$ and $\{y_n\}_n$ by Bessel sequences. In this

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\lambda_n (A^*_nx_n\otimes \bar{B^*_ny_n})$, where
$\{A_n\}_n$ and $\{B_n\}_n$ are operator-valued Bessel sequences and
$\{x_n\}_n$, $\{y_n\}_n$ are sequences in the Hilbert space such that
$\{\|x_n\|\|y_n\|\}_n \in \ell^\infty(\mathbb{N})$. We next generalize the

Essential for these experiments is the presence of a two-level spin system
whose energy splitting can be chosen by applying a magnetic field. In recent
years, a combination of electron spin resonance (ESR) and scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) has been demonstrated as a technique to detect magnetic
properties of single atoms on surfaces and to achieve sub-${\mu}$eV energy
resolution. Nevertheless, up to now the role of the required magnetic fields
has not been elucidated. Here, we perform single-atom ESR on individual Fe
atoms adsorbed on magnesium oxide (MgO), using a 2D vector magnetic field as
well as the local field of the magnetic STM tip in a commercially available
STM. We show how the ESR amplitude can be greatly improved by optimizing the
magnetic fields, revealing in particular an enhanced signal at large in-plane
magnetic fields. Moreover, we demonstrate that the stray field from the
magnetic STM tip is a versatile tool. We use it here to drive the electron spin
more efficiently and to perform ESR measurements at constant frequency by
employing tip-field sweeps. Lastly, we show that it is possible to perform ESR
using only the tip field, under zero external magnetic field, which promises to
make this technique available in many existing STM systems.

for the coarse segmentation, each 2D CT slice was normalized to be of the same

each 2D CT slice was first resampled to be of the same pixel size and then
cropped to be of the same image size. In other words, the image inputs to the

the fine segmentation were 2D MR patches of the same image size as well as the

hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks by varying three parameters:
the mass ratio $q$ of a planet to a central star, the ratio of the disk scale
height $h_p$ to the orbital radius $r_p$ of the planet, and the viscosity
parameter $\alpha$. We find the gap depth $\delta_\Sigma$ in the gas surface
density depends on a single dimensionless parameter $K\equiv
q^2(h_p/r_p)^{-5}\alpha^{-1}$ as $\delta_\Sigma = (1 + 0.046K)^{-1}$,
consistent with the previous results of Kanagawa et al. (2015a). The gap depth
$\delta_V$ in the rotational velocity is given by $\delta_V= 0.007 (h_p/r_p)
K^{1.38}/(1 +0.06K^{1.03})$. The gap width, in both surface density and
rotational velocity, has a minimum of about $4.7 h_p$ when the planet mass
$M_p$ is around the disk thermal mass $M_{\text{th}}$, while it increases in a
power-law fashion as $M_p/M_{\text{th}}$ increases or decrease from unity. Such
a minimum in the gap width arises because spirals from sub-thermal planets have
to propagate before they shock the disk gas and open a gap. We compare our
relations for the gap depth and width with the previous results, and discuss
their applicability to observations.

stochastic background of gravitational waves is expected to arise from a
superposition of a large number of unresolved cosmological and/or astrophysical

variational auto-encoder (VAE), followed by a separate step to cast the
continuous latent representation of VAE into binary code. To avoid the
performance loss caused by the separate casting, a model using a Bernoulli
mixture prior is further developed, in which an end-to-end training is admitted

Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the

large heterogeneities on the component level. For electronic clock networks
this implies detuned intrinsic frequencies and differences in coupling strength
and the characteristic time-delays associated with signal transmission,
processing and feedback. Using a phase-model description, we study the effects
of such component heterogeneity on the dynamical properties of synchronization
in networks of mutually delay-coupled Kuramoto oscillators. We test the theory
against experimental results and circuit-level simulations in a prototype
system of mutually delay-coupled electronic clocks, so called phase-locked
loops. Contrary to the hindering effects of component heterogeneity for the
synchronization in hierarchical networks, we show that clock heterogeneities
can enhance self-organized synchronization in networks with flat hierarchy.
That means that beyond the optimizations that can be achieved by tuning
homogeneous coupling strengths, time-delays and loop-filter cut-off
frequencies, heterogeneities in these system parameters enable much better
optimization of perturbation decay rates, the stabilization of synchronous
states and the tuning of phase-differences between the clocks. Our theory
enables the design of custom-fit synchronization layers according to the
specific requirements and properties of electronic systems, such as operational
frequencies, phase-relations and e.g. transmission-delays. These results are

recent ones. The dominating paradigm for tracking this flow of knowledge is to
count the number of direct citations, but this neglects the fact that beneath
the first layer of citations there is a full body of literature. In this study,
we go underneath the ""shoulders"" by investigating the cumulative knowledge
creation process in a citation network of around 35 million publications. In
particular, we study stylized models of persistent influence and diffusion that
take into account all the possible chains of citations. When we study the
persistent influence values of publications and their citation counts, we find
that the publications related to Nobel Prizes i.e. Nobel papers have higher
ranks in terms of persistent influence than that due to citations, and that the
most outperforming publications are typically early works leading to hot
research topics of their time. The diffusion model reveals a significant
variation in the rates at which different fields of research share knowledge.
We find that these rates have been increasing systematically for several
decades, which can be explained by the increase in the publication volumes.
Overall, our results suggest that analyzing cumulative knowledge creation on a
global scale can be useful in estimating the type and scale of scientific
influence of individual publications and entire research areas as well as
yielding insights which could not be discovered by using only the direct
citation counts.

one DNN model to misclassify but may not fool other ensemble DNN members
consistently. In this paper we first give an overview of the concept of
ensemble diversity and examine the three types of ensemble diversity in the

caused by a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) from a gradual eruption of a large
quiet-region filament. We investigate the eruption and propagation
characteristics of this CME in relation to the strong geomagnetic storm with
remote sensing and in situ observations. Coronal magnetic fields around the
filament are extrapolated and compared with EUV observations. We determine the
propagation direction and tilt angle of the CME flux rope near the Sun using a
graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model and the Sun-to-Earth kinematics of the
CME with wide-angle imaging observations from STEREO A. We reconstruct the
flux-rope structure using a Grad-Shafranov technique based on the in situ
measurements at the Earth and compare it with those from solar observations and
the GCS results. Our conclusions are as follows: (1) the eruption of the
filament was unusually slow and occurred in the regions with relatively low
critical heights of the coronal field decay index; (2) the axis of the CME flux
rope rotated in the corona as well as in interplanetary space, which tended to
be aligned with the local heliospheric current sheet; (3) the CME was bracketed
between slow and fast solar winds, which enhanced the magnetic field inside the
CME at 1 AU; (4) the geomagnetic storm was caused by the enhanced magnetic
field and a southward orientation of the flux rope at 1 AU from the rotation of
the flux rope.

Recently, significant progress has been made towards understanding and
measuring the physical properties of Weyl semimetals. Yet, potential
applications remain relatively sparse. Here, we propose Weyl semimetal
nanowires as field-effect transistors, dubbed WEYLFETs. Specifically, applying
gradient gate voltage along the nanowire, an electrical field is generated that
effectively tilts the open surfaces, thus, varying the relative orientation
between Fermi arcs on different surfaces. As a result, perfect negative
refraction between adjacent surfaces can occur and longitudinal conductance
along the wire is suppressed. The WEYLFET offers a high on/off ratio with low
power consumption. Adverse effects due to dispersive Fermi arcs and surface

self-supervised end-to-end approach with view synthesis as the supervisory
signal. This is achieved with a framework that predicts depth and camera
motion, with a loss based on reconstructing a target video frame from
temporally adjacent frames. In this context, occlusion relates to parts of a
scene that can be observed in the target frame but not in a frame used for
image reconstruction. Since the image reconstruction is based on sampling from
the adjacent frame, and occluded areas by definition cannot be sampled,
reconstructed occluded areas corrupt to the supervisory signal. In previous
work arXiv:1806.01260 occlusion is handled based on reconstruction error; at
each pixel location, only the reconstruction with the lowest error is included
in the loss. The current study aims to determine whether performance
improvements of depth estimation models can be gained by during training only
ignoring those regions that are affected by occlusion.
  In this work we introduce occlusion mask, a mask that during training can be
used to specifically ignore regions that cannot be reconstructed due to
occlusions. Occlusion mask is based entirely on predicted depth information. We
introduce two novel loss formulations which incorporate the occlusion mask. The
method and implementation of arXiv:1806.01260 serves as the foundation for our
modifications as well as the baseline in our experiments. We demonstrate that
(i) incorporating occlusion mask in the loss function improves the performance
of single image depth prediction models on the KITTI benchmark. (ii) loss
functions that select from reconstructions based on error are able to ignore
some of the reprojection error caused by object motion.

regions of their host galaxies. This is particularly pronounced in the star
formation desert (SFD) which is defined as two symmetrical regions either side
of the bar that show a deficit in young stars. Previous studies proposed that,
if star formation is truncated because of the influence of the bar, then the
age distribution of stars within the SFD could be used to determine the epoch
of bar formation. To test this, we study the properties of SFDs in 6 galaxies
from zoom-in cosmological re-simulations. Age maps reveal old regions on both
sides of the bars, with a lack of stars younger than 10 Myr, confirming the SFD
phenomenon. Local star formation is truncated in the SFDs because after the bar
forms, gas in these regions is removed on 1 Gyr timescales. However, the
overall age distribution of stars in the SFD does not show a sharp truncation
after bar formation but rather a gradual downturn in comparison to that of the
bar. This more subtle signature may still give information on bar formation
epochs in observed galaxies, but the interpretation will be more difficult than
originally hoped. The gradual drop in the SFD age distribution, instead of a
truncation, is due to radial migration of stars born in the disk. The SFD is

functioning of an apparatus from the sole knowledge of observed measurement
statistics, i.e. without assumptions on the internal functioning of the
devices. When these Bell tests are implemented with devices having too low
efficiency, one has to post-select the events that lead to successful
detections and thus rely on a fair sampling assumption. The question that we
address in this paper is what remains of a device-independent certification
under fair sampling. We provide an intuitive description of post-selections in
terms of filters and define the fair sampling assumption as a property of these
filters, equivalent to the definition introduced in [Berry et. al., PRA 81(1),
012109 (2010)]. When this assumption is fulfilled, the post-selected data is
reproduced by an ideal experiment where lossless devices measure a filtered
state which can be obtained from the actual state via local probabilistic maps.
Trusted conclusions can thus be obtained on the quantum properties of this
filtered state and the corresponding measurement statistics can reliably be
used, e.g., for randomness generation or quantum key distribution. We also
explore a stronger notion of fair sampling leading to the conclusion that the
post-selected data is a fair representation of the data that would be obtained
with lossless detections. Furthermore, we show that our conclusions hold in
cases of small deviations from exact fair sampling. Finally, we describe setups
previously or potentially used in Bell-type experiments under fair sampling and
identify the underlying device-specific assumptions.

of primary importance in many sectors, namely textile, fashion and interior

characterize element-based texture, so we present Texel-Att to fill this gap.
Texel-Att is the first fine-grained, attribute-based representation and
classification framework for element-based textures. It first individuates
texels, characterizing them with individual attributes; subsequently, texels
are grouped and characterized through layout attributes, which give the
Texel-Att representation. Texels are detected by a Mask-RCNN, trained on a
brand-new element-based texture dataset, ElBa, containing 30K texture images
with 3M fully-annotated texels. Examples of individual and layout attributes
are exhibited to give a glimpse on the level of achievable graininess. In the
experiments, we present detection results to show that texels can be precisely
individuated, even on textures ""in the wild""; to this sake, we individuate the
element-based classes of the Describable Texture Dataset (DTD), where almost
900K texels have been manually annotated, leading to the Element-based DTD

expressivity of Texel-Att on ElBa and E-DTD, overcoming the alternative
features and relative attributes, doubling the best performance in some cases;
finally, we report interactive search results on ElBa and E-DTD: with Texel-Att
on the E-DTD dataset we are able to individuate within 10 iterations the
desired texture in the 90% of cases, against the 71% obtained with a

higher availability, businesses rely on geographically dispersed datacenters
that host such applications more than ever. Dedicated inter-datacenter networks
have been built that provide high visibility into the network status and
flexible control over traffic forwarding to offer quality communication across
the instances of applications hosted on many datacenters. These networks are
relatively small, with tens to hundreds of nodes and are managed by the same
organization that operates the datacenters which make centralized traffic
engineering feasible. Using coordinated data transmission from the services and
routing over the inter-datacenter network, one can optimize the network
performance according to a variety of utility functions that take into account
data transfer deadlines, network capacity consumption, and transfer completion
times.
  In this dissertation, we study techniques and algorithms for fast and
efficient data transfers across geographically dispersed datacenters over the
inter-datacenter networks. We discuss different forms and properties of
inter-datacenter transfers and present a generalized optimization framework to
maximize an operator selected utility function. Next, in the several chapters
that follow, we study, in detail, the problems of admission control for
transfers with deadlines and inter-datacenter multicast transfers. For the
admission control problem, our solutions offer significant speed up in the
admission control process while offering almost identical performance in the
total traffic admitted into the network. For the bulk multicasting problem, our
techniques enable significant performance gain in receiver completion times
with low computational complexity, which makes them highly applicable to
inter-datacenter networks.

rich formal language. Multiple forms of inference can be applied to this formal

between information and problem solving. The knowledge base that we use in this

different inferences to this knowledge base, we can solve the following tasks:
to determine the state of the system after a certain delegation or revocation;
to interactively simulate the progression of the system state through time; to
determine whether a user has a certain permission or administrative right given
a certain state of the system; to verify invariants of the system; and to
determine which revocation schemes give rise to a certain specified set of

  Combinatorial Compilation","Part of DECLARE 19 proceedings",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Paisley is a declarative lightweight embedded domain-specific language for
expressive, non-deterministic, non-invasive pattern matching on arbitrary data
structures in Java applications. As such, it comes as a pure Java library of
pattern-matching combinators and corresponding programming idioms. While the
combinators support a basic form of self-optimization based on heuristic
metadata, overall performance is limited by the distributed and compositional
implementation that impedes non-local code optimization. In this paper, we
describe a technique for improving the performance of Paisley transparently,
without compromising the flexible and extensible combinatorial design. By means
of distributed bytecode generation, dynamic class loading and just-in-time
compilation of patterns, the run-time overhead of the combinatorial approach
can be reduced significantly, without requiring any technology other than a
standard Java virtual machine and our LLJava bytecode framework. We evaluate
the impact by comparison to earlier benchmarking results on interpreted
Paisley. The key ideas of our compilation technique are fairly general, and
apply in principle to any kind of combinator language running on any
jit-compiling host.

the interface is (i) minimal because SGX-LKL uses a complete library OS inside
the enclave, including file system and network stacks, which requires a host

encrypts and integrity-protects all data passed via low-level I/O operations;

seedlings undergoes a striking, and developmentally significant, reorientation
upon exposure to light. This process is driven by the exponential amplification
of a population of longitudinal microtubules, created by severing events
localized at crossovers with the microtubules of the pre-existing transverse
array. We present a dynamic one-dimensional model for microtubule amplification
through this type of templated severing. We focus on the role of the
probability of immediate rescue-after-severing of the newly-created lagging
microtubule, observed to be a characteristic feature of the reorientation
process. Employing stochastic simulations, we show that in the dynamic regime
of unbounded microtubule growth, a finite value of this probability is not
required for amplification to occur, but does strongly influence the degree of
amplification, and hence the speed of the reorientation process. In contrast,
in the regime of bounded microtubule growth, we show that amplification only
occurs above a critical threshold. We construct an approximate analytical
theory, based on a priori limiting the number of crossover events considered,
which allows us to predict the observed critical value of the
rescue-after-severing probability with reasonable accuracy.

hydrogen (HI), including limits on its scatter, based on simple assumptions
about the structure of HI discs. We trial three generic profiles for HI surface
density as a function of radius. Firstly, we assert that HI surface densities
saturate at a variable threshold, and otherwise fall off exponentially with
radius or, secondly, radius squared. Our third model assumes the total gas
surface density is exponential, with the HI fraction at each radius depending
on local pressure. These are tested against a compilation of 110 galaxies from
the THINGS, LITTLE THINGS, LVHIS, and Bluedisk surveys, whose HI surface
density profiles are well resolved. All models fit the observations well and
predict consistent size-mass relations. Using an analytical argument, we
explain why processes that cause gas disc truncation - such as ram-pressure
stripping - scarcely affect the HI size-mass relation. This is tested with the
IllustrisTNG(100) cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation and the Dark Sage
semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, both of which capture radially
resolved disc structure. For galaxies with m_*>10^9 M_solar and m_HI>10^8
M_solar, both simulations predict HI size-mass relations that align with
observations, show no difference between central and satellite galaxies, and
show only a minor, second-order dependence on host halo mass for satellites.
Ultimately, the universally tight HI size-mass relation is mathematically
inevitable and robust. Only by completely disrupting the structure of HI discs,
e.g. through overly powerful feedback, could a simulation predict the relation
poorly.

to sense their surrounding environment. CAVs can improve their perception
capabilities if vehicles exchange information about what they sense using V2X
communications. This is known as cooperative or collective perception (or
sensing). A frequent transmission of collective perception messages could
improve the perception capabilities of CAVs. However, this improvement can be
compromised if vehicles generate too many messages and saturate the
communications channel. An important aspect is then when vehicles should
generate the perception messages. ETSI has proposed the first set of message
generation rules for collective perception. These rules define when vehicles
should generate collective perception messages and what should be their
content. We show that the current rules generate a high number of collective
perception messages with information about a small number of detected objects.
This results in an inefficient use of the communication channel that reduces
the effectiveness of collective perception. We address this challenge and
propose an improved algorithm that modifies the generation of collective
perception messages. We demonstrate that the proposed solution improves the
reliability of V2X communication and the perception of CAVs.

networks. It defines a user-friendly API that trades-off model complexity with
ease of use, unlike other libraries whose focus is on dealing with very general
probabilistic models at the cost of having a more complex API. In particular,
this package allows to define, learn and evaluate general hierarchical
probabilistic models containing deep neural networks in a compact and simple
way. InferPy is built on top of Tensorflow Probability and Keras.

electronics and quantum information processing. While the technology for
fabricating low $T_{c}$ JJ is mature and delivers quantum circuits able to
reach the ""quantum supremacy"", the fabrication of reproducible and low-noise
high-$T_{c}$ JJ is still a challenge to be taken up. Here we report on noise
properties at RF frequencies of recently introduced high-$T_{c}$ Josephson
nano-junctions fabricated by mean of a Helium ion beam focused at sub-nanometer
scale on a $\mathrm{YBa}_2\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_7$ thin film. We show that
their current-voltage characteristics follow the standard
Resistively-Shunted-Junction (RSJ) circuit model, and that their characteristic
frequency $f_{c}=(2e/h)I_{c}R_{n}$ reaches $\sim 300$ GHz at low temperature.
Using the ""detector response"" method, we evidence that the Josephson
oscillation linewidth is only limited by the thermal noise in the RSJ model for
temperature ranging from $T\sim 20$ K to $75$ K. At lower temperature and for
the highest He irradiation dose, the shot noise contribution must also be taken
into account when approaching the tunneling regime. We conclude that these
Josephson nano-junctions present the lowest noise level possible, which makes
them very promising for future applications in the microwave and terahertz
regimes.

position and momentum that manifests in modifications of the canonical
commutation relations. Experimental tests of such modifications remain an
outstanding challenge. These corrections scale with the mass of test particles,
which motivates experiments using macroscopic composite particles. Here we
consider a challenge to such tests, namely that quantum gravity corrections of
canonical commutation relations are expected to be suppressed with increasing
number of constituent particles. Since the precise scaling of this suppression
is unknown, it needs to be bounded experimentally and explicitly incorporated
into rigorous analyses of quantum gravity tests. We analyse this scaling based
on concrete experiments involving macroscopic pendula and provide tight bounds
that exceed those of current experiments based on quantum mechanical
oscillators. Furthermore, we discuss possible experiments that promise even
stronger bounds thus bringing rigorous and well-controlled tests of quantum
gravity closer to reality.

cavity-mediated long-range interaction and observed the emergence of a
supersolid phase and a density wave phase in addition to Mott insulator and
superfluid phases. Here we consider theoretically the effect of uncorrelated
disorder on the phase diagram of this system and study the two-dimensional
Bose-Hubbard model with cavity-mediated long-range interactions and
uncorrelated diagonal disorder. We also study the phase diagram of the extended
Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor interactions in the presence of
uncorrelated diagonal disorder. The extended Bose-Hubbard model with
nearest-neighbor interactions has been realized in the experiment using dipolar
interaction recently. With the help of quantum Monte Carlo simulations using
the worm algorithm, we determine the phase diagram of those two models. We
compare the phase diagrams of cavity-mediated long-range interactions with
nearest-neighbor interactions. We show that two kinds of Bose glass phases
exist: one with and one without density wave order. We also find that weak
disorder enhances the supersolid phase.

efficiency thanks to the usage of many advanced tools and improvements, such as
advanced inter-prediction modes. However, these come at the cost of high
computational complexity of encoder, which may limit the benefits of the
standard in practical applications. This paper shows that not all sequences
benefit from using all such modes, which indicates that a number of encoder
optimisations can be introduced to speed up AV1 encoding. A method based on
decision trees is proposed to selectively decide whether to test all inter
modes. Appropriate features are extracted and used to perform the decision for
each block. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the
encoding time on average by 43.4\% with limited impact on the coding
efficiency.

of tuning the ground states of the interface between the two band insulators of
LAO and STO from metallic/superconducting to highly insulating. Increasing the
Mn doping level (x) leads to a delicate control of the carrier density as well
as a raise in the electron mobility and spin polarization. Herein, we
demonstrate a tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and spin polarization of
LAMO/STO (0.2 <= x <= 0.3) by applying a back gate. The presence of SOC causes
the splitting of energy band into two branches by a spin splitting energy. The
maximum spin splitting energy depends on the Mn doping and decreases with the
increasing Mn content and then vanishes at x = 0.3. The carrier density
dependence of the spin splitting energy for different compositions shows a
dome-shaped behavior with a maximum at different normalized carrier density.
These findings have not yet been observed in LAO/STO interfaces. A fully
back-gate-tunable spin-polarized 2DEL is observed at the interface with x = 0.3
where only dxy orbits are populated (5.3E12 cm-2 <= ns <= 1.0E13 cm-2). The
present results shed light on unexplored territory in SOC at STO-base oxide
heterostructures and make LAMO/STO an intriguing platform for spin-related
phenomena in 3d-electron systems.

eleven confidently detected gravitational-wave events during the first two
observing runs of the advanced detector era. All eleven events were consistent
with being from well-modeled mergers between compact stellar-mass objects:
black holes or neutron stars. The data around the time of each of these events
have been made publicly available through the gravitational-wave open science
center. The entirety of the gravitational-wave strain data from the first and
second observing runs have also now been made publicly available. There is
considerable interest among the broad scientific community in understanding the
data and methods used in the analyses. In this paper, we provide an overview of
the detector noise properties and the data analysis techniques used to detect
gravitational-wave signals and infer the source properties. We describe some of
the checks that are performed to validate the analyses and results from the
observations of gravitational-wave events. We also address concerns that have
been raised about various properties of LIGO-Virgo detector noise and the
correctness of our analyses as applied to the resulting data.

it dealing with change caused by uncertainties during operation, such as
changing availability of resources and fluctuating workloads. To ensure that
the system complies with the adaptation goals, recent research suggests the use
of formal techniques at runtime. Yet, existing approaches have three
limitations that affect their practical applicability: (i) they ignore
correctness of the behavior of the feedback loop, (ii) they rely on exhaustive
verification at runtime to select adaptation options to realize the adaptation
goals, which is time and resource demanding, and (iii) they provide limited or
no support for changing adaptation goals at runtime. To tackle these
shortcomings, we present ActivFORMS (Active FORmal Models for Self-adaptation).
ActivFORMS contributes an end-to-end approach for engineering self-adaptive
systems, spanning four main stages of the life cycle of a feedback loop:
design, deployment, runtime adaptation, and evolution. We also present
ActivFORMS-ta, a tool-supported instance of ActivFORMS that leverages timed
automata models and statistical model checking at runtime. We validate the
research results using an IoT application for building security monitoring that
is deployed in Leuven. The experimental results demonstrate that ActivFORMS
supports correctness of the behavior of the feedback loop, achieves the
adaptation goals in an efficient way, and supports changing adaptation goals at
runtime.

simultaneously construct an observer and the associated backstepping controller

regularity results are provided for all pde models. Although the linear part of
the model is similar to the KdV equation, the power type nonlinearity brings
additional difficulties. We give two examples of boundary conditions and
partial measurements. We also present numerical algorithms and simulations

voltage by a longitudinal heat current in conducting ferromagnets or
antiferromagnets - is an appealing approach for thermoelectric power generation
in spin caloritronics. The ANE in antiferromagnets is particularly convenient
for the fabrication of highly efficient and densely integrated thermopiles as
lateral configurations of thermoelectric modules increase the coverage of heat
source without suffering from the stray fields that are intrinsic to
ferromagnets. In this work, using first-principles calculations together with a
group theory analysis, we systematically investigate the spin order-dependent
ANE in noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn-based antiperovskite nitrides
Mn$_{3}X$N ($X$ = Ga, Zn, Ag, and Ni). The ANE in Mn$_{3}X$N is forbidden by
symmetry in the R1 phase but amounts to its maximum value in the R3 phase.
Among all Mn$_{3}X$N compounds, Mn$_{3}$NiN presents the most significant
anomalous Nernst conductivity of 1.80 AK$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ at 200 K, which can be
further enhanced if strain, electric, or magnetic fields are applied. The ANE
in Mn$_{3}$NiN, being one order of magnitude larger than that in the famous
Mn$_{3}$Sn, is the largest one discovered in antiferromagnets so far. The giant
ANE in Mn$_{3}$NiN originates from the sharp slope of the anomalous Hall
conductivity at the Fermi energy, which can be understood well from the Mott
relation. Our findings provide a novel host material for realizing
antiferromagnetic spin caloritronics which promises exciting applications in
energy conversion and information processing.

maximum entropy grows; its asymptotics determine geometric information about X,

long-range random four-spin couplings that exhibits quantum chaos. The black
hole limit corresponds to a system where the microstates are approximately
degenerate and equally likely, corresponding to the high temperature limit of
the spin system. At the leading level of approximation, reconstruction of bulk
physics implies that local probes of the black hole should exhibit free
propagation and unitary local evolution. We test the conjecture that a
particular mean field Hamiltonian provides such a local bulk Hamiltonian by
numerically solving the exact Schrodinger equation and comparing the time
evolution to the approximate mean field time values. We find excellent
agreement between the two time evolutions for timescales smaller than the
scrambling time. In earlier work, it was shown bulk evolution along comparable
timeslices is spoiled by the presence of the curvature singularity, thus the
matching found in the present work provides evidence of the success of this
approach to interior holography. The numerical solutions also provide a useful
testing ground for various measures of quantum chaos and global scrambling. A
number of different observables, such as entanglement entropy,
out-of-time-order correlators, and trace distance are used to study these
effects. This leads to a suitable definition of scrambling time, and evidence
is presented showing a logarithmic variation with the system size.

pulsars may actually be strange stars rather than neutron stars. According to
this SQM hypothesis, strange planets can also stably exist. The density of
normal matter planets can hardly be higher than 30 g cm$^{-3}$. As a result,
they will be tidally disrupted when its orbital radius is less than $\sim
5.6\times10^{10} \rm \, cm $, or when the orbital period ($P_{\rm orb}$) is
less than $ \sim \rm 6100\, s $. On the contrary, a strange planet can safely
survive even when it is very close to the host, due to its high density. The
feature can help us identify SQM objects. In this study, we have tried to
search for SQM objects among close-in exoplanets orbiting around pulsars.
Encouragingly, it is found that four pulsar planets (XTE J1807-294 b, XTE
J1751-305 b, PSR 0636 b, PSR J1807-2459A b) completely meet the criteria of
$P_{\rm orb} < \rm 6100\, s $, and are thus good candidates for SQM planets.
The orbital periods of two other planets (PSR J1719+14 b and PSR J2051-0827 b)
are only slightly higher than the criteria. They could be regarded as potential
candidates. Additionally, we find that the periods of five white dwarf planets
(GP Com b, V396 Hya b, J1433 b, WD 0137-349 b, and SDSS J1411+2009 b) are less
than 0.1 days. We argue that they might also be SQM planets. It is further
found that the persistent gravitational wave emissions from at least three of
these close-in planetary systems are detectable to LISA. More encouragingly,
the advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope are able to detect the gravitational
wave bursts produced by the merger events of such SQM planetary systems, which
will provide a unique test for the SQM hypothesis.

important changes in the simulated signals and the recovered microstructure

Linear coherent reservoirs can solve difficult tasks but are aided by nonlinear

nonlinear transformations of information in the reservoir input layer, its bulk

for cell detection in images acquired with inverted microscopy. This model
considers cell detection as a task of finding most probable locations that
suggest cell centers in an image. It represents this main task with a
regression task of learning an inner distance metric. However, different than
the previously reported regression based methods, the DeepDistance model
proposes to approach its learning as a multi-task regression problem where
multiple tasks are learned by using shared feature representations. To this
end, it defines a secondary metric, normalized outer distance, to represent a
different aspect of the problem and proposes to define its learning as
complementary to the main cell detection task. In order to learn these two
complementary tasks more effectively, the DeepDistance model designs a fully
convolutional network (FCN) with a shared encoder path and end-to-end trains
this FCN to concurrently learn the tasks in parallel. DeepDistance uses the
inner distances estimated by this FCN in a detection algorithm to locate
individual cells in a given image. For further performance improvement on the
main task, this paper also presents an extended version of the DeepDistance
model. This extended model includes an auxiliary classification task and learns
it in parallel to the two regression tasks by sharing feature representations
with them. Our experiments on three different human cell lines reveal that the

on the lattice. Some QW are well-known to recover the $(2+1)$--dimensional
Dirac equation in continuum limit, i.e. the free propagation of the 1/2-spin
fermion. We study two such Dirac QW, one on the square grid and the other on a
triangular grid reminiscent of graphene-like materials. The numerical
simulations show that the walker localises around the defects in $O(\sqrt{N})$
steps with probability $O(1/\log{N})$, in line with previous QW search on the
grid. The main advantage brought by those of this paper is that they could be
implemented as `naturally occurring' freely propagating particles over a
surface featuring topological---without the need for a specific oracle step.
From a quantum computing perspective, however, this hints at novel applications
of QW search : instead of using them to look for `good' solutions within the
configuration space of a problem, we could use them to look for topological
properties of the entire configuration space.

about the structure of the output query to make a more contextually-informed
selection of database constants. We use message-passing through a graph neural

  Conference, 6 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Comprehensive semantic segmentation is one of the key components for robust
scene understanding and a requirement to enable autonomous driving. Driven by
large scale datasets, convolutional neural networks show impressive results on
this task. However, a segmentation algorithm generalizing to various scenes and
conditions would require an enormously diverse dataset, making the labour
intensive data acquisition and labeling process prohibitively expensive. Under
the assumption of structural similarities between segmentation maps, domain
adaptation promises to resolve this challenge by transferring knowledge from
existing, potentially simulated datasets to new environments where no
supervision exists. While the performance of this approach is contingent on the
concept that neural networks learn a high level understanding of scene
structure, recent work suggests that neural networks are biased towards
overfitting to texture instead of learning structural and shape information.
Considering the ideas underlying semantic segmentation, we employ random image
stylization to augment the training dataset and propose a training procedure
that facilitates texture underfitting to improve the performance of domain
adaptation. In experiments with supervised as well as unsupervised methods for
the task of synthetic-to-real domain adaptation, we show that our approach
outperforms conventional training methods.

enhances the potential for catastrophic cyber or physical attacks due to

this work proposes generating real-time blocks {\it ad hoc} through a machine

difference with the DW model. The possible reason is that the DW-2019 model
provides the strong nonlocal effect, which behaves as the anisotropic effect to
influence the matter perturbation in the low-redshift range. Finally the
qualitative analysis of the screening mechanism is discussed by considering the
spacial dependence of the nonlocal modification in the small-scale range.

optimization often infeasible. In this work, we present a method that enables
the optimization of complex systems through Machine Learning (ML) techniques.
We show how well-known learning algorithms are able to reliably emulate a
complex simulator with a modest dataset obtained from it. The trained emulator
is then able to yield values close to the simulated ones in virtually no time.
Therefore, it is possible to perform a global numerical optimization over the
vast multi-dimensional parameter space, in a fraction of the time that would be
required by a simple brute-force search. As a testbed for the proposed
methodology, we used a network simulator for next-generation mmWave cellular
systems. After simulating several antenna configurations and collecting the
resulting network-level statistics, we feed it into our framework. Results show
that, even with few data points, extrapolating a continuous model makes it
possible to estimate the global optimum configuration almost instantaneously.
The very same tool can then be used to achieve any further optimization goal on
the same input parameters in negligible time.

with the aim to quantify the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm power spectrum
bias caused by gridding, ultimately to determine the suitability of different
imaging algorithms and gridding settings for 21-cm power spectrum analysis. We
simulate realistic LOFAR data, and construct power spectra with convolutional
gridding and w-stacking, w-projection, image domain gridding and without
w-correction. These are compared against directly Fourier transformed data. The
influence of oversampling, kernel size, w-quantization, kernel windowing
function and image padding are quantified. The gridding excess power is
measured with a foreground subtraction strategy, for which foregrounds have
been subtracted using Gaussian progress regression, as well as with a
foreground avoidance strategy.
  Constructing a power spectrum that has a bias significantly lower compared to
the expected EoR signals is possible with the tested methods, but requires a
kernel oversampling factor > 4000 and, when using w-correction, > 500
w-quantization levels. These values are higher than typical values used for
imaging, but are computationally feasible. The kernel size and padding factor
parameters are less crucial. Among the tested methods, image domain gridding
shows the highest accuracy with the lowest imaging time.
  LOFAR 21-cm power spectrum results are not affected by gridding. Image domain
gridding is overall the most suitable algorithm for 21-cm EoR experiments,
including for future SKA EoR analyses. Nevertheless, convolutional gridding
with tuned parameters results in sufficient accuracy. This holds also for
w-stacking for wide-field imaging. The w-projection algorithm is less suitable

  recovering reduced models from data with operator inference",,,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work introduces a method for learning low-dimensional models from data
of high-dimensional black-box dynamical systems. The novelty is that the
learned models are exactly the reduced models that are traditionally
constructed with model reduction techniques that require full knowledge of
governing equations and operators of the high-dimensional systems. Thus, the
learned models are guaranteed to inherit the well-studied properties of reduced
models from traditional model reduction. The key ingredient is a new data
sampling scheme to obtain re-projected trajectories of high-dimensional systems
that correspond to Markovian dynamics in low-dimensional subspaces. The exact
recovery of reduced models from these re-projected trajectories is guaranteed
pre-asymptotically under certain conditions for finite amounts of data and for
a large class of systems with polynomial nonlinear terms. Numerical results
demonstrate that the low-dimensional models learned with the proposed approach
match reduced models from traditional model reduction up to numerical errors in
practice. The numerical results further indicate that low-dimensional models
fitted to re-projected trajectories are predictive even in situations where
models fitted to trajectories without re-projection are inaccurate and
unstable.

XMM-Newton observations of the SMC, archival and recent radio continuum
observations, an optical line emission survey, and new optical spectroscopic
observations. We can thus build a complete and clean sample of 19 confirmed and
4 candidate SNRs. The homogeneous X-ray spectral analysis allows to search for
SN ejecta and Fe K line emission, and to measure interstellar medium (ISM)
abundances. We estimate the ratio of core-collapse to type Ia supernova rates
of the SMC based on the X-ray properties and the local stellar environment of
each SNR. Results : After the removal of unconfirmed or misclassified objects,
and the addition of two newly confirmed SNRs based on multi-wavelength
features, we present a final list of 21 confirmed SNRs and 2 candidates. While
no Fe K line is detected even for the brightest and youngest SNR, we find X-ray
evidence of SN ejecta in 11 SNRs. We estimate a ratio of 4.7$_{-1.9} ^{+0.6}$
core-collapse supernova to every type Ia SN, three times higher than in the
LMC. The difference can be ascribed to the absence of the enhanced star
formation episode in the SMC, which occurred in the LMC 0.5-1.5 Gyr ago. The
hot-gas abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe are 0.1-0.2 times solar. Their ratios
with respect to SMC stellar abundances reflect the effects of dust depletion
and partial dust destruction in SNR shocks. We find evidence that the ambient
medium probed by SMC SNRs is less disturbed and less dense on average than in
the LMC, consistent with the different morphologies of the two galaxies.

and secrete large amounts of citrate into the lumen of the prostate. Citrate is
a Krebs cycle metabolite produced in the condensation reaction between
acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate in the mitochondria of the cell. With the
application of $^{13}$C enriched substrates, such as $^{13}$C glucose or
pyruvate, to prostate cells or tissues, it is possible to identify the
contributions of different metabolic pathways to this production and secretion
of citrate. In this work we present a quantitative model describing the
mitochondrial production and the secretion of citrate by prostatic epithelial
cells employing the $^{13}$C labeling pattern of secreted citrate as readout.
We derived equations for the secretion fraction of citrate and the contribution
of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) versus the anaplerotic pyruvate
carboxylase (PC) pathways in supplying the Krebs cycle with carbons from
pyruvate for the production of citrate. These measures are independent of
initial $^{13}$C-enrichment of the administered supplements and of $^{13}$C
J-coupling patterns, making this method robust also if SNR is low. We propose
use of these equations to distinguish between citrate metabolism in healthy and
diseased prostate tissue, in particular upon malignant transformation.

covalent and weakly ionic materials, where the valence force field parameters
are derived in terms of $\zeta$ and the bulk elastic constants $C_{11}$,
$C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$. We show that this model breaks down as the material
becomes more ionic and specifically when the elastic anisotropy factor $A =
2C_{44}/(C_{11}-C_{12}) > 2$. The analytic model can be stabilised for ionic
materials by including Martin's electrostatic terms with effective cation and
anion charges in the valence force field model. Inclusion of effective charges
determined via the optical phonon mode splitting provides a stable model for
all but two of the materials considered (zincblende GaN and AlN). A stable
model is obtained for all materials considered by also utilising the inner
elastic constant $E_{11}$ to determine the magnitude of the effective charges
used in the Coulomb interaction. Test calculations show that the models
describe well structural relaxation in superlattices and alloys, and reproduce
key phonon band structure features.

heuristic algorithms have been developed for the problem, as pointed out by
McCreesh et al. [JAIR 2018], for each of them there are rather small instances
which they cannot cope. Therefore, developing an alternative approach that
could possibly cope with these hard instances would be of interest.
  A seminal paper by Alon, Yuster and Zwick [J. ACM 1995] introduced the color
coding approach to solve the problem, where the main part is a dynamic
programming over color subsets and partial mappings. As with many
exponential-time dynamic programming algorithms, the memory requirements
constitute the main limiting factor for its usage. Because these requirements
grow exponentially with the treewidth of the pattern graph, all existing
implementations based on the color coding principle restrict themselves to
specific pattern graphs, e.g., paths or trees. In contrast, we provide an
efficient implementation of the algorithm significantly reducing its memory
requirements so that it can be used for pattern graphs of larger treewidth.
Moreover, our implementation not only decides the existence of an isomorphic
subgraph, but it also enumerates all such subgraphs (or given number of them).
  We provide an extensive experimental comparison of our implementation to
other available solvers for the problem.

the line ratios of $W_{\rm CO\,(2-1)}$/$W_{\rm CO\,(1-0)}$ range from 0.5 to
1.6 with a median of $0.84\pm0.15$. The high CO line ratios $W_{\rm

simulations based on the assumed density-temperature structure for the inner
rims of ringlike shell, where are the compressed areas in bubble N131. These
high CO integrated intensity ratios, such as $W_{\rm CO\,(3-2)}$/$W_{\rm

can be used as a tracer of gas compressed regions with a relatively high
temperature and density. This further suggests that the non-Gaussian part of
the line-ratio distribution can be used to trace the interaction between the
molecular gas and the hot gas in the bubble.

n$ random matrix $M_n := M+N_n$, where $M$ is a fixed complex matrix with
operator norm at most $\exp(n^{c})$ and $N_n$ is a random matrix, each of whose
entries is an independent copy of a complex random variable with mean $0$ and
variance $1$. Motivated by applications, our focus is on obtaining bounds which
hold with extremely high probability, rather than on the least singular value
of a typical such matrix.
  This setting has previously been considered in a series of influential works
by Tao and Vu, most notably in connection with the strong circular law, and the
smoothed analysis of the condition number, and our results improve upon theirs
in two ways:
  (i) We are able to handle $\|M\| = O(\exp(n^{c}))$, whereas the results of
Tao and Vu are applicable only for $M = O(\text{poly(n)})$.
  (ii) Even for $M = O(\text{poly(n)})$, we are able to extract more refined
information -- for instance, our results show that for such $M$, the
probability that $M_n$ is singular is $O(\exp(-n^{c}))$, whereas even in the
case when $\xi$ is a Bernoulli random variable, the results of Tao and Vu only
give a bound of the form $O_{C}(n^{-C})$ for any constant $C>0$.
  As opposed to all previous works obtaining such bounds with error rate better
than $n^{-1}$, our proof makes no use either of the inverse Littlewood--Offord
theorems, or of any sophisticated net constructions. Instead, we show how to
reduce the problem from the (complex) sphere to (Gaussian) integer vectors,
where it is solved directly by utilizing and extending a combinatorial approach
to the singularity problem for random discrete matrices, recently developed by
Ferber, Luh, Samotij, and the author.

  Modern treatments of $\mathrm GLP$ tend to interpret the $[n]$ provability
notion as ""provable in a base theory $T$ together with all true $\Pi^0_n$

provability is $\Sigma^0_1$ complete and that similar results hold for stronger
provability notions. As such, the oracle sentences to define provability at

a mathematical perspective, QSS reduction is generally interpreted as a special
type of singular perturbation reduction, but in many instances the
correspondence is not worked out rigorously, and the QSS reduction may yield
incorrect results. The present paper contains a thorough discussion of QSS
reduction and its relation to singular perturbation reduction for the special,

linear in the variables to be eliminated. For this class we give necessary and

where x are CAD parameters. This task is difficult when f is the output of an
expensive-to-evaluate numerical simulator and the number of CAD parameters is
large. Most often, the set of all considered CAD shapes resides in a manifold
of lower effective dimension in which it is preferable to build the surrogate
model and perform the optimization. In this work, we uncover the manifold
through a high-dimensional shape mapping and build a new coordinate system made
of eigenshapes. The surrogate model is learned in the space of eigenshapes: a
regularized likelihood maximization provides the most relevant dimensions for
the output. The final surrogate model is detailed (anisotropic) with respect to
the most sensitive eigenshapes and rough (isotropic) in the remaining
dimensions. Last, the optimization is carried out with a focus on the critical
dimensions, the remaining ones being coarsely optimized through a random
embedding and the manifold being accounted for through a replication strategy.
At low budgets, the methodology leads to a more accurate model and a faster
optimization than the classical approach of directly working with the CAD
parameters.

the three-dimensional (3D) spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for ultracold atoms
without using the laser beams. This is achieved by subjecting an atom to a
periodic perturbation which is the product of a position-dependent Hermitian
operator $\hat{V}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)$ and a fast oscillating periodic
function $f\left(\omega t\right)$ with a zero average. To have a significant
spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we analyze a situation where the characteristic
energy of the periodic driving is not necessarily small compared to the driving
energy $\hbar\omega$. Applying a unitary transformation to eliminate the
original periodic perturbation, we arrive at a non-Abelian (non-commuting)
vector potential term describing the 3D SOC. The general formalism is
illustrated by analyzing the motion of an atom in a spatially inhomogeneous
magnetic field oscillating in time. A cylindrically symmetric magnetic field
provides the SOC involving the coupling between the spin $\mathbf{F}$ and all
three components of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) $\mathbf{L}$. In
particular, the spherically symmetric monopole-type synthetic magnetic field
$\mathbf{B}\propto\mathbf{r}$ generates the 3D SOC of the $\mathbf{L}\cdot
\mathbf{F}$ form, which resembles the fine-structure interaction of hydrodgen
atom. However, the strength of the SOC here goes as $1/r^{2}$ for larger
distances, instead of $1/r^3$ as in atomic fine structure. Such a longer-ranged
SOC significantly affects not only the lower states of the trapped atom, but
also the higher ones. Furthermore, by properly tailoring the external trapping
potential, the ground state of the system can occur at finite OAM, while the
ground state of hydrogen atom has zero OAM.

reduces dialogue to the task of producing at any one time a next utterance;

decision, this is sound: Even the longest journey is a sequence of steps. It
becomes detrimental, however, when the tasks and datasets from which dialogue
behaviour is to be learned are tailored too much to this framing of the
problem. In this short note, we describe a family of settings which still allow
to keep dialogues simple, but add a constraint that makes participants care
about reaching mutual understanding. In such agreement games, there is a
secondary, but explicit goal besides the task level goal, and that is to reach
mutual understanding about whether the task level goal has been reached. As we
argue, this naturally triggers meta-semantic interaction and mutual engagement,

shown that the excitation temperature of PN is usually lower than the gas
kinetic temperature, suggesting that PN is likely in conditions of sub-thermal
excitation. We present an analysis of PN which takes the possible sub-thermal
excitation conditions into account in a sample of 24 massive star-forming
regions. We observed PN (2-1), (3-2), (4-3), and (6-5) with the IRAM-30m and
APEX telescopes and detected PN lines in 15 of them. Together with 9 similar
sources detected in PN in previous works, we have analysed the largest sample
of star-forming regions to date, made of 33 sources with 24 detections in total
(among which 13 are new detections). Hence, we have increased the number of
star-forming regions detected in PN by more than a factor 2. Our analysis
indicates that the PN lines are indeed sub-thermally excited, but well
described by a single excitation temperature. We have compared line profiles
and fractional abundances of PN and SiO, a typical shock tracer, and found that
almost all objects detected in PN have high-velocity SiO wings. Moreover, the
SiO and PN abundances with respect to H2 are correlated over several orders of
magnitude, and uncorrelated with gas temperature. This clearly shows that the
production of PN is strongly linked to the presence of shocked gas, and rules
out alternative scenarios based on thermal evaporation from iced grain mantles.

be scalar as is common, but to be able to attain values in $\mathbb{R}^{2\times

observed in experiments.
  While there have been various results for scalar chemotactic sensitivities
$S$ due to a convenient energy-type inequality and some for the non-scalar case

the analysis of the third equation in ($\star$) significantly, we consider the
full combined case under little restrictions for the system giving us very
little to go on in terms of a priori estimates. We nonetheless manage to still
achieve sufficient estimates using Trudinger-Moser type inequalities to extend
the existence results seen in a recent work by Winkler for the Stokes case with
non-scalar $S$ to the full Navier-Stokes case. Namely, we construct a similar
global mass-preserving generalized solution for ($\star$) in planar convex
domains for sufficiently smooth parameter functions $S$, $f$ and $\phi$ and
only under the fairly weak assumptions that $S$ is appropriately bounded, $f$
is non-negative and $f(0) = 0$.

Trapped ions are among the most accurately controlled and best isolated quantum

complexity tractable by classical computers the main challenge is to realise
fast entanglement operations in large ion crystals. The strong dipole-dipole
interactions in polar molecule and Rydberg atom systems allow much faster
entangling gates, yet stable state-independent confinement comparable with
trapped ions needs to be demonstrated in these systems. Here, we combine the
benefits of these approaches: we report a $700\,\mathrm{ns}$ two-ion entangling
gate which utilises the strong dipolar interaction between trapped Rydberg ions
and produce a Bell state with $78\%$ fidelity. The sources of gate error are
identified and a total error below $0.2\%$ is predicted for
experimentally-achievable parameters. Furthermore, we predict that residual
coupling to motional modes contributes $\sim 10^{-4}$ gate error in a large ion
crystal of 100 ions. This provides a new avenue to significantly speed up and
scale up trapped ion quantum computers and simulators.

fields which perform work that does not couple statistically to the considered

separation methods require a lot of supervised data to achieve excellent
performance. Although multichannel methods based on spatial information can
work without such training data, they are often sensitive to parameter
initialization and degraded with the sources located close to each other. The
proposed method uses a cost function based on a spatial model called a complex
Gaussian mixture model (cGMM). This model has the time-frequency (TF) masks and
direction of arrivals (DoAs) of sources as latent variables and is used for
training separation and localization networks that respectively estimate these
variables. This joint training solves the frequency permutation ambiguity of
the spatial model in a unified deep Bayesian framework. In addition, the
pre-trained network can be used not only for conducting monaural separation but
also for efficiently initializing a multichannel separation algorithm.
Experimental results with simulated speech mixtures showed that our method

due to the amount of data that needs to be processed and, more importantly, the

easy to acquire unlabeled data. Our network architecture relies on a novel
interconnection of two components: a fully convolutional network to model
spatial information and temporal units that are employed at intermediate levels

The main contribution of this work is the guidance of the temporal signal
through the network. We show that only placing a temporal module between the

multi-beam multi-user interference, and, to improve the uplink transmission
performance, we propose a centralized scheme that optimizes the power, the beam

involves both continuous and discrete variables, and it has the following
structure. If we fix all discrete variables, except for those related to the
UE-AP assignment, the resulting optimization problem can be solved optimally.
This property enables us to propose a heuristic based on simulated annealing
(SA) to address the intractable joint optimization problem with all discrete
variables. In more detail, for a fixed configuration of beams, we formulate a
weighted rate allocation problem where each user gets the same portion of its
maximum achievable rate that it would have under non-interfered conditions. We
solve this problem with an iterative fixed point algorithm that optimizes the
power of UEs and the UE - AP assignment in the uplink. This fixed point
algorithm is combined with SA to improve the beam configurations. Theoretical
and numerical results show that the proposed method improves both the UE rates
in the lower percentiles and the overall fairness in the network.

this work we propose a new variational inference method, which integrates both
noise estimation and image denoising into a unique Bayesian framework, for
blind image denoising. Specifically, an approximate posterior, parameterized by
deep neural networks, is presented by taking the intrinsic clean image and
noise variances as latent variables conditioned on the input noisy image. This
posterior provides explicit parametric forms for all its involved
hyper-parameters, and thus can be easily implemented for blind image denoising
with automatic noise estimation for the test noisy image. On one hand, as other
data-driven deep learning methods, our method, namely variational denoising

posterior expression. On the other hand, VDN inherits the advantages of
traditional model-driven approaches, especially the good generalization
capability of generative models. VDN has good interpretability and can be
flexibly utilized to estimate and remove complicated non-i.i.d. noise collected
in real scenarios. Comprehensive experiments are performed to substantiate the
superiority of our method in blind image denoising.

  Electronic Society (WPES 2019)",,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to its hereditary nature, genomic data is not only linked to its owner
but to that of close relatives as well. As a result, its sensitivity does not
really degrade over time; in fact, the relevance of a genomic sequence is
likely to be longer than the security provided by encryption. This prompts the
need for specialized techniques providing long-term security for genomic data,
yet the only available tool for this purpose is GenoGuard (Huang et al., 2015).
By relying on Honey Encryption, GenoGuard is secure against an adversary that
can brute force all possible keys; i.e., whenever an attacker tries to decrypt
using an incorrect password, she will obtain an incorrect but plausible looking
decoy sequence.
  In this paper, we set to analyze the real-world security guarantees provided
by GenoGuard; specifically, assess how much more information does access to a
ciphertext encrypted using GenoGuard yield, compared to one that was not.
Overall, we find that, if the adversary has access to side information in the
form of partial information from the target sequence, the use of GenoGuard does
appreciably increase her power in determining the rest of the sequence. We show
that, in the case of a sequence encrypted using an easily guessable
(low-entropy) password, the adversary is able to rule out most decoy sequences,
and obtain the target sequence with just 2.5\% of it available as side
information. In the case of a harder-to-guess (high-entropy) password, we show
that the adversary still obtains, on average, better accuracy in guessing the
rest of the target sequences than using state-of-the-art genomic sequence
inference methods, obtaining up to 15% improvement in accuracy.

rapidly turning fields, which can be natural in negatively curved field spaces.
The curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, of these models undergoes an exponential,
transient amplification around the time of horizon crossing, but can still be
compatible with observations at the level of the power spectrum. However, a
recent analysis (based on a proposed single-field effective theory with an
imaginary speed of sound) found that the trispectrum and other higher-order,
non-Gaussian correlators also undergo similar exponential enhancements. This
arguably leads to `hyper-large' non-Gaussianities in stark conflict with
observations, and even to the loss of perturbative control of the calculations.
In this paper, we provide the first analytic solution of the growth of the
perturbations in two-field rapid-turn models, and find it in good agreement
with previous numerical and single-field EFT estimates. We also show that the
nested structure of commutators of the in-in formalism has subtle and crucial
consequences: accounting for these commutators, we show analytically that the
naively leading-order piece (which indeed is exponentially large) cancels
exactly in all relevant correlators. The remaining non-Gaussianities of these
models are modest, and there is no problem with perturbative control from the
exponential enhancement of $\zeta$. Thus, rapid-turn inflation with negatively
curved field spaces remains a viable and interesting class of candidate
theories of the early universe.

crossbar array has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate the challenges

weight quantization have been seperately investigated and proven effectiveness
in reducing area and power consumption compared to the original DNN model.
However, there has been no systematic investigation of memristor-based

memristor-based framework considering both structured weight pruning and weight

regularized optimization, masked mapping and retraining. Experimental results

just like bare quark mass terms. We show that the strength of the interaction
is roughly $10$ times smaller than standard strong interactions. We describe it
as an effective interaction $g'\bar{q}q\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi$ with the monopole
field $\Phi$ and $g'$ being of the order of $(10\rm \,GeV)^{-1}$ or less. It
produces small constituent quark masses less than $1$MeV when the monopoles
condense ( $\langle\Phi\rangle\neq 0 $ ). We examine to what extent such a weak
but explicit symmetry breaking interaction is allowed. In particular, examining
Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation we find that the presence of such a small
symmetry breaking term is still allowed within the present accuracy of lattice
gauge simulations. We predict some phenomenological effects caused by the
chiral nonsymmetric monopole quark interaction. Quark confinement and chiral
condensate ( $\langle\bar{q}q\rangle\neq 0$ ) arise simultaneously. The
condensate $\langle\bar{q}q\rangle$ caused by the monopoles is proportional to

make a quantum thermodynamical description of space-time. We found a finite
number of discrete energy levels for a scalar field from a polynomial condition
of the confluent hypergeometric functions expanded around $r=0$. As in the
previous work, we obtain that the uncertainty principle is valid for each
energy level on sub-horizon scales of space-time. We found that temperature and
entropy are dependent on the number of sub-states on each energy's level and
the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature of each energy level is recovered when the
number of sub-states of a given level tends to infinity. We propose that the
primordial state of the universe could be described by a de Sitter metric with
Planck energy $E_p=m_p\,c^2$, and a B-H temperature:
$T_{BH}=\left(\frac{\hbar\,c}{2\pi\,l_p\,K_B}\right)$.

observational data can be used to propose a decision rule based on a prognostic
prediction model. We then propose a framework for emulating a prediction driven
trial to evaluate the utility of a prediction-based decision rule in
observational data. A split-sample structure can and should be used to develop
the prognostic model, define the decision rule, and evaluate its clinical
utility.

  application to estimating the serve advantage in professional tennis",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In professional tennis, it is often acknowledged that the server has an
initial advantage. Indeed, the majority of points are won by the server, making
the serve one of the most important elements in this sport. In this paper, we
focus on the role of the serve advantage in winning a point as a function of
the rally length. We propose a Bayesian isotonic logistic regression model for
the probability of winning a point on serve. In particular, we decompose the
logit of the probability of winning via a linear combination of B-splines basis
functions, with athlete-specific basis function coefficients. Further, we
ensure the serve advantage decreases with rally length by imposing constraints
on the spline coefficients. We also consider the rally ability of each player,
and study how the different types of court may impact on the player's rally
ability. We apply our methodology to a Grand Slam singles matches dataset.

Lattice Boltzmann method (RLBM) for dissipative hydrodynamics. We describe in
full detail a unified, compact and dimension-independent procedure to design
relativistic LB schemes capable of bridging the gap between the
ultra-relativistic regime, $k_{\rm B} T \gg mc^2$, and the non-relativistic
one, $k_{\rm B} T \ll mc^2$. We further develop a systematic derivation of the
transport coefficients as a function of the kinetic relaxation time in
$d=1,2,3$ spatial dimensions. The latter step allows to establish a
quantitative bridge between the parameters of the kinetic model and the
macroscopic transport coefficients. This leads to accurate calibrations of
simulation parameters and is also relevant at the theoretical level, as it
provides neat numerical evidence of the correctness of the Chapman-Enskog
procedure. We present an extended set of validation tests, in which simulation
results based on the RLBMs are compared with existing analytic or semi-analytic
results in the mildly-relativistic ($k_{\rm B} T \sim mc^2$) regime for the
case of shock propagations in quark-gluon plasmas and laminar electronic flows
in ultra-clean graphene samples. It is hoped and expected that the material
collected in this paper may allow the interested readers to reproduce the
present results and generate new applications of the RLBM scheme.

they rely on flat-feature vector representations, which makes them unsuitable
for richly structured domains such as those arising in applications like social
network analysis. Such domains rely on relational representations to capture
complex relationships between entities and their attributes. Thus, we consider
the problem of learning neural networks for relational data. We distinguish
ourselves from current approaches that rely on expert hand-coded rules by
learning relational random-walk-based features to capture local structural
interactions and the resulting network architecture. We further exploit
parameter tying of the network weights of the resulting relational neural
network, where instances of the same type share parameters. Our experimental
results across several standard relational data sets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach over multiple neural net baselines as
well as state-of-the-art statistical relational models.

the availability of detailed information about road-related objects and their
geolocations, especially at road intersections. However, these road
intersections are mainly represented as point elements without detailed
information, or are even not available in current versions of crowdsourced
mapping databases including OpenStreetMap(OSM). This study develops an approach
to automatically detect road objects and place them to right location from
street-level images. Our processing pipeline relies on two convolutional neural
networks: the first segments the images, while the second detects and
classifies the specific objects. Moreover, to locate the detected objects, we
establish an attributed topological binary tree(ATBT) based on urban grammar
for each image to depict the coherent relations of topologies, attributes and
semantics of the road objects. Then the ATBT is further matched with map
features on OSM to determine the right placed location. The proposed method has
been applied to a case study in Berlin, Germany. We validate the effectiveness
of our method on two object classes: traffic signs and traffic lights.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides
near-precise localization results in terms of completeness and positional
accuracy. Among many potential applications, the output may be combined with
other sources of data to guide autonomous vehicles

  History of Astronomy",,,,"physics.hist-ph astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1717 Halley compared contemporaneous measurements of the latitudes of four
stars with earlier measurements by ancient Greek astronomers and by Brahe, and
from the differences concluded that these four stars showed proper motion. An
analysis with modern methods shows that the data used by Halley do not contain
significant evidence for proper motion. What Halley found are the measurement
errors of Ptolemaios and Brahe. Halley further argued that the occultation of
Aldebaran by the Moon on 11 March 509 in Athens confirmed the change in
latitude of Aldebaran. In fact, however, the relevant observation was almost
certainly made in Alexandria where Aldebaran was not occulted. By carefully
considering measurement errors Jacques Cassini showed that Halley's results
from comparison with earlier astronomers were spurious, a conclusion partially
confirmed by various later authors. Cassini's careful study of the measurements
of the latitude of Arcturus provides the first significant evidence for proper
motion.
