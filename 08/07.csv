populations in Galactic globular clusters, and in Magellanic Clouds' massive
intermediate-age and old clusters, has led to a major change in our views about
the formation of these objects. To date, none of the proposed scenarios is able
to explain quantitatively all chemical patterns observed in individual
clusters, and an extension of the study of multiple populations to resolved
extragalactic massive clusters beyond the Magellanic Clouds would be welcome,
for it would enable to investigate and characterize the presence of multiple
populations in different environments and age ranges. To this purpose, the
James Webb Space Telescope can potentially play a major role. On the one hand,
the JWST promises direct observations of proto-globular cluster candidates at
high redshift; on the other hand, it can potentially push to larger distances
the sample of resolved clusters with detected multiple populations. In this
paper we have addressed this second goal. Using theoretical stellar spectra and
stellar evolution models, we have investigated the effect of multiple
population chemical patterns on synthetic magnitudes in the JWST infrared
NIRCam filters. We have identified the colours (F150W-F460M), (F115W-F460M) and
pseudocolours C_{F150W,F460M,F115W}=(F150W-F460M)-(F460M-F115W),
C_{F150W,F277W,F115W}=(F150W-F277W)-(F277W-F115W), as diagnostics able to
reveal the presence of multiple populations along the red giant branches of old
and intermediate age clusters. Using the available on-line simulator for the
NIRCam detector, we have estimated that multiple populations can be potentially
detected --depending on the exposure times, exact filter combination used, plus
the extent of the abundance variations and the cluster [Fe/H]--out to a
distance of about 5Mpc (approximately the distance to the M83 group).

subject to undesired boundary effects. Several approaches to enlarge search
regions have been already proposed in the past years to make up for this
shortcoming. However, with excessive background information, more background
noises are also introduced and the discriminative filter is prone to learn from
the ambiance rather than the object. This situation, along with appearance
changes of objects caused by full/partial occlusion, illumination variation,
and other reasons has made it more likely to have aberrances in the detection
process, which could substantially degrade the credibility of its result.
Therefore, in this work, a novel approach to repress the aberrances happening
during the detection process is proposed, i.e., aberrance repressed correlation
filter (ARCF). By enforcing restriction to the rate of alteration in response
maps generated in the detection phase, the ARCF tracker can evidently suppress
aberrances and is thus more robust and accurate to track objects. Considerable
experiments are conducted on different UAV datasets to perform object tracking
from an aerial view, i.e., UAV123, UAVDT, and DTB70, with 243 challenging image
sequences containing over 90K frames to verify the performance of the ARCF
tracker and it has proven itself to have outperformed other 20 state-of-the-art
trackers based on DCF and deep-based frameworks with sufficient speed for
real-time applications.

to have lower data reconstruction error compared to standard Optimal Mode

computational cost arising from solving a non-convex matrix optimization
problem. We demonstrate model order reduction on the complex linearized
Ginzburg-Landau equation in the globally unstable regime and on the unsteady

low-dimensional full-state feedback controller is constructed using
reduced-order models constructed using DMD, OMD and lrDMD. It is shown that
lrDMD stabilizes the Ginzburg-Landau system with a lower order controller and
is able to suppress vortex shedding from an inclined flat plate at a cost lower
than either DMD or OMD. It is further shown that lrDMD yields an improved
estimate of the adjoint system, for a given rank, relative to DMD and OMD.

attention by showing that state-of-the-art deep neural networks are vulnerable
to adversarial examples, stemming from small perturbations being added to the
input image. Adversarial examples are generated by a malicious adversary by
obtaining access to the model parameters, such as gradient information, to
alter the input or by attacking a substitute model and transferring those
malicious examples over to attack the victim model. Specifically, one of these
attack algorithms, Robust Physical Perturbations ($RP_2$), generates
adversarial images of stop signs with black and white stickers to achieve high
targeted misclassification rates against standard-architecture traffic sign
classifiers. In this paper, we propose BlurNet, a defense against the $RP_2$
attack. First, we motivate the defense with a frequency analysis of the first
layer feature maps of the network on the LISA dataset, which shows that high
frequency noise is introduced into the input image by the $RP_2$ algorithm. To
remove the high frequency noise, we introduce a depthwise convolution layer of
standard blur kernels after the first layer. We perform a blackbox transfer
attack to show that low-pass filtering the feature maps is more beneficial than
filtering the input. We then present various regularization schemes to
incorporate this low-pass filtering behavior into the training regime of the
network and perform white-box attacks. We conclude with an adaptive attack
evaluation to show that the success rate of the attack drops from 90\% to 20\%
with total variation regularization, one of the proposed defenses.

as a consequence of anyon pair condensation induced by the coupling between

  the role of Brownian map in higher dimensions",,,,,"math.PR hep-th math-ph math.CO math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this last decade, an important stochastic model emerged: the Brownian map.
It is the limit of various models of random combinatorial maps after rescaling:
it is a random metric space with Hausdorff dimension 4, almost surely
homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, and possesses some deep connections with
  Liouville quantum gravity in 2D. In this paper, we present a sequence of
random objects that we call $D$th-random feuilletages (denoted by ${\bf
r}[D]$), indexed by a parameter $D\geq 0$ and which are candidate to play the
role of the Brownian map in dimension $D$. The construction relies on some
objects that we name iterated Brownian snakes, which are branching analogues of
iterated Brownian motions, and which are moreover limits of iterated discrete
snakes. In the planar $D=2$ case, the family of discrete snakes considered
coincides with some family of (random) labeled trees known to encode planar
quadrangulations.
  Iterating snakes provides a sequence of random trees $({\bf t}^{(j)}, j\geq
1)$. The $D$th-random feuilletage ${\bf r}[D]$ is built using $({\bf
t}^{(1)},\cdots,{\bf t}^{(D)})$: ${\bf r}[0]$ is a deterministic circle, ${\bf
r}[1]$ is Aldous' continuum random tree, ${\bf r}[2]$ is the Brownian map, and
somehow, ${\bf r}[D]$ is obtained by quotienting ${\bf t}^{(D)}$ by ${\bf
r}[D-1]$.
  A discrete counterpart to ${\bf r}[D]$ is introduced and called the $D$th
random discrete feuilletage with $n+D$ nodes (${\bf r}_n[D]$). The proof of the
convergence of ${\bf r}_n[D]$ to ${\bf r}[D]$ after appropriate rescaling in
some functional space is provided (however, the convergence obtained is too
weak to imply the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence). An upper bound on the diameter
of ${\bf r}_{n}[D]$ is $n^{1/2^{D}}$. Some elements allowing to conjecture that
the Hausdorff dimension of ${\bf r}[D]$ is $2^D$ are given.

provide crucial information on how they grow in the local universe. A detailed
study of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) properties of un-relaxed systems is
essential to understand the fate of in-falling structures and, more generally,
the virialization process. We analyzed a mosaic of XMM-Newton observations (240

the main cluster RXC J1825.3+3026 to be in a late merger phase, whereas its

ratio of ~1:2 for the pair. No diffuse X-ray emission is found in the region
between them, indicating that these clusters are in a pre-merger phase. We
found evidence of a galaxy group infalling on RXC J1825.3+3026 in an advanced
state of disruption. The Southern Galaxy, one of the brightest galaxies in the
Lyra complex, was very likely at the center of the infalling group. This galaxy
has a gaseous corona indicating that it was able to retain some of its gas
after the ram-pressure stripping of the intra-group medium. In this scenario
the diffuse emission excess observed southwest of RXC J1825.3+3026 could be due
to gas once belonging to the group and/or to cluster ICM dislocated by the
passage of the group. Finally, we identified three high-velocity galaxies
aligned between RXC J1825.3+3026 and the SG, two of these showing evidence of
gas stripped from them during infall. We estimate them to be currently falling
onto the main cluster at an infall velocity of ~ 3000 km/s. Our study of the

RXCJ1825 and CIZAJ1824 we report the redshifts, z=0.0645 and z=0.0708, the
first estimates of velocity dispersion, sigmav=995 and 700 km/s, and dynamical
mass, M200=1.1E15 and 4E14 Msun. The past assembly of RXCJ1825 is traced by the
two dominant galaxies, both aligned with the major axis of the galaxy
distribution along the East-West direction, and by a minor North-East
substructure. We also detect a quite peculiar high velocity field in the
South-West region of the Lyra complex. This feature is likely related to a high
velocity, very luminous galaxy, suggested to be the central galaxy of a group
in interaction with RXCJ1825 by very recent studies based on X-ray and radio
data. The redshift of the whole Lyra complex is z=0.067. Assuming that the
redshift difference between RXCJ1825 and CIZAJ1824 is due to the relative
kinematics, the projected distance between the cluster centers is 1.3 Mpc and
the los velocity difference is 1750 km/s. A dynamical analysis of the system
shows that the two clusters are likely to be gravitationally bound, in a
pre-merger phase, with CIZAJ1824 in front of RXCJ1825 and going toward it. Our
results corroborate a picture where the Lyra region is the place of a very
complex scenario of cluster assembly.

quantities in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes by introducing a sharp
cutoff in a radial coordinate. This procedure is a priori coordinate-dependent,
and may not be well-motivated in full, covariant general relativity; however,
the fact that physically meaningful quantities such as the entanglement entropy
can be obtained by such a regulation procedure suggests some underlying
covariance. In this paper, we provide a careful treatment of the radial cutoff
procedure for computing holographic entanglement entropy in asymptotically
anti-de Sitter spacetimes. We prove two results that are frequently assumed in
the literature, but that have not been carefully addressed: (i) that the choice
of a ""globally minimal surface"" among several extremal candidates is
independent of the choice of regulator, and (ii) that finite CFT quantities
such as the mutual information which involve ""divergence-cancelling"" sums of
holographic entanglement entropies are well-defined. Our results imply that the
""globally minimal surface"" prescription for computing holographic entanglement
entropy is well-posed from the perspective of general relativity, and thus
support the belief that this is the correct prescription for identifying the
entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion in AdS/CFT. We also comment on the
geometric source of state-dependent divergences in the holographic entanglement
entropy, and identify precisely the regime of validity of the ""vacuum
subtraction"" protocol for regulating infinite entanglement entropies in
arbitrary states by comparing them to the entanglement entropies of identical
regions in the vacuum. Our proofs make use of novel techniques for the

\textit{collection} of planes, each including a different number of objects
$N_{\rm sat}$. We apply this method to the position data of confirmed MW and
M31 satellites and quantify the quality of planes through the outputs of a
Tensor of Inertia plane-fitting technique. Plane quality is quantified in terms
of population ($N_{\rm sat}$) and flattening (the short-to-long axis ratio
$c/a$ or the rms thickness normal to the plane). Therefore, planes with the
same population or flattening can be compared with each other allowing us to
single-out best-quality planes. For the first time, we study the second-most
predominant planar configuration of satellites in M31, singling out a plane
with 18 satellite members that shows a quality comparable to the Great Plane of
Andromeda (GPoA, with $N_{\rm sat}=19$) despite it being more affected by
distance uncertainties. This structure is viewed nearly face-on from the MW and
is approximately normal to the GPoA. Overall, we find planes of satellites

this study, we focus on relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), which is
based on the difference between the reactions of the eyes when they are exposed
to light stimuli. Incumbent RAPD assessment methods are based on subjective
practices that can lead to unreliable measurements. To eliminate subjectivity
and obtain reliable measurements, we introduced an automated framework to
detect RAPD. For validation, we conducted a clinical study with
lab-on-a-headset, which can perform automated light reflex test. In addition to
benchmarking handcrafted algorithms, we proposed a transfer learning-based
approach that transformed a deep learning-based generic object recognition
algorithm into a pupil detector. Based on the conducted experiments, proposed
algorithm RAPDNet can achieve a sensitivity and a specificity of 90.6% over 64
test cases in a balanced set, which corresponds to an AUC of 0.929 in ROC
analysis. According to our benchmark with three handcrafted algorithms and nine
performance metrics, RAPDNet outperforms all other algorithms in every

amounts of molecular hydrogen with $\log N$(HI, H$_2$) = $22.20\pm
0.05,~20.40\pm 0.04$ (GRB\,181020A) and $\log N$(HI, H$_2$) = $22.15\pm
0.05,~19.44\pm 0.04$ (GRB\,190114A). The DLA metallicites, depletion levels and
dust extinctions are [Zn/H] = $-1.57\pm 0.06$, [Zn/Fe] = $0.67\pm 0.03$, and
$A_V = 0.27\pm 0.02$\,mag (GRB\,181020A) and [Zn/H] = $-1.23\pm 0.07$, [Zn/Fe]

the molecular gas content of all known H$_2$-bearing GRB-DLAs and explore the
physical conditions and characteristics of these systems. We confirm that H$_2$
is detected in all CI- and H$^*_2$-bearing GRB absorption systems, but that
these rarer features are not necessarily detected in all GRB H$_2$ absorbers.
We find that a large molecular fraction of $f_{\rm H_2} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ is
required for CI to be detected. The defining characteristic for H$^*_2$ to be
present is less clear, though a large H$_2$ column density is an essential
factor. We then derive the H$_2$ excitation temperatures of the molecular gas
and find that they are relatively low with $T_{\rm ex} \approx 100 - 300$\,K,
however, there could be evidence of warmer components populating the high-$J$
H$_2$ levels in GRBs\,181020A and 190114A. Finally, we demonstrate that the
otherwise successful X-shooter GRB afterglow campaign is hampered by a
significant dust bias excluding the most dust-obscured H$_2$ absorbers from
identification [Abridged].

ferromagnetism appears when the $e_{\downarrow}$ states start to be occupied.
The band splitting due to $s$-$d$ hybridization was found to be significantly

Compton wavelength is comparable to the black hole size. The boson cloud spins
down the black hole through a process called superradiance, lowering the black
hole spin to a characteristic value. It has been suggested that spin
measurements of the black holes detected by ground-based gravitational-wave
detectors can be used to constrain the mass of ultralight bosons.
Unfortunately, a measurement of the individual black hole spins is often
uncertain, resulting in inconclusive results. Instead, we use hierarchical
Bayesian inference to combine information from multiple gravitational-wave
sources and obtain stronger constraints. We show that hundreds of high

tomography(PAT) involving a novel form of regularization and demonstrate its
ability to recover good quality images from significantly reduced size
datasets. The regularization is constructed to suit the physical structure of
typical PAT images. We construct it by combining second-order derivatives and
intensity into a non-convex form to exploit a structural property of PAT images
that we observe: in PAT images, high intensities and high second-order
derivatives are jointly sparse. The specific form of regularization constructed
here is a modification of the form proposed for fluorescence image restoration.
This regularization is combined with a data fidelity cost, and the required
image is obtained as the minimizer of this cost. As this regularization is
non-convex, the efficiency of the minimization method is crucial in obtaining
artifact-free reconstructions. We develop a custom minimization method for
efficiently handling this non-convex minimization problem. Further, as
non-convex minimization requires a large number of iterations and the PAT
forward model in the data-fidelity term has to be applied in the iterations, we
propose a computational structure for efficient implementation of the forward
model with reduced memory requirements. We evaluate the proposed method on both
simulated and real measured data sets and compare them with a recent
reconstruction method that is based on a well-known fast iterative shrinkage
threshold algorithm (FISTA).

underlying physics. Impulsive SEP events, defined by uniquely large
enhancements of Fe/O, emerge from magnetic reconnection in solar jets. In
small, ""pure,"" shock-free, impulsive SEP events, protons with mass-to-charge
ratio A/Q = 1 fit the power-law dependence of element abundance enhancements
versus A/Q extrapolated from the heavier elements 2 < Z < 57. Sometimes these
events have order-of-magnitude suppressions of He, even though H fits with
heavier elements, perhaps because of the slower ionization of He during a rapid
rise of plasma from the chromosphere. In larger impulsive SEP events, He fits,
but there are large proton excesses relative to the power-law fit of Z > 2
ions, probably because associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) drive shock
waves fast enough to reaccelerate the impulsive SEPs but also to sample protons
from the ambient solar plasma. In contrast, gradual SEP events are accelerated
by wide, fast CME-driven shock waves, but those with smaller, weaker shocks,
perhaps quasi-perpendicular, favor impulsive suprathermal residue left by many
previous jets, again supplemented with excess protons from ambient coronal
plasma. In the larger, more common gradual SEP events, faster, stronger shock
waves sample the ambient coronal plasma more deeply, overwhelming any
impulsive-ion component, so that proton abundances again fit the same power-law
distribution as all other elements. Thus, studies of the power-law behavior in
A/Q of SEP element abundances give compelling new information on the varying
physics of SEP acceleration and properties of the underlying corona.

limit that the disk is sufficiently low mass that the planet migrates more
slowly than the disk material. In that case, the disk's surface density profile
is determined by the disk being in viscous steady state (VSS), while
overflowing the planet's orbit. We compute the VSS profiles with 2D
hydrodynamical simulations, and show that disk material piles up behind the
planet, with the planet effectively acting as a leaky dam. Previous 2D
hydrodynamical simulations missed the pileup effect because of incorrect
boundary conditions, while previous 1D models greatly overpredicted the pileup
due to the neglect of non-local deposition. Our simulations quantify the
magnitude of the pileup for a variety of planet masses and disk viscosities. We
also calculate theoretically the magnitude of the pileup for moderately deep
gaps, showing good agreement with simulations. For very deep gaps, current
theory is inadequate, and we show why and what must be understood better. The
pileup is important for two reasons. First, it is observable in directly imaged
protoplanetary disks, and hence can be used to diagnose the mass of a planet
that causes it or the viscosity within the disk. And second, it determines the
planet's migration rate. Our simulations determine a new Type-II migration rate
(valid for low mass disks), and show how it connects continuously with the
well-verified Type-I rate.

viable solution to extract finite-state models from execution logs. However,
existing techniques do not scale well when processing very large logs, such as
system-level logs obtained by combining component-level logs. Furthermore, in
the case of component-based systems, existing techniques assume to know the
definitions of communication channels between components. However, this
information is usually not available in the case of systems integrating
3rd-party components with limited documentation. In this paper, we address the
scalability problem of inferring the model of a component-based system from the
individual component-level logs, when the only available information about the
system are high-level architecture dependencies among components and a
(possibly incomplete) list of log message templates denoting communication
events between components. Our model inference technique, called SCALER,
follows a divide and conquer approach. The idea is to first infer a model of
each system component from the corresponding logs; then, the individual
component models are merged together taking into account the dependencies among
components, as reflected in the logs. We evaluated SCALER in terms of
scalability and accuracy, using a dataset of logs from an industrial system;
the results show that SCALER can process much larger logs than a
state-of-the-art tool, while yielding more accurate models.

atlas-defined segmented regions, age, and sex for 3739 subjects used for
training and internal validation and 415 subjects used for external validation.
We trained sex-specific convolutional neural net (CNN) and random forest models
to predict Gf. For the convolutional model, skull-stripped volumetric T1W
images aligned to the SRI24 brain atlas were used for training. Volumes of
segmented atlas regions along with each subject's age were used to train the
random forest regressor models. Performance was measured using the mean squared

CNNs. Further, the external validation data had a better MSE for females than
males (60.68 vs. 80.74), with a combined MSE of 70.83. Our results suggest that
predictive models of Gf from volumetric T1W MRI features alone may perform
better when trained separately on male and female data. However, the

management, but require invasive sampling that fail to detect relevant features
because of tumor heterogeneity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
accuracy of a voxel-wise, multiparametric MRI radiomic method to predict
features and develop a minimally invasive method to objectively assess
neoplasms.
  Methods: Multiparametric MRI were registered to T1-weighted gadolinium
contrast-enhanced data using a 12 degree-of-freedom affine model. The
retrospectively collected MRI data included T1-weighted, T1-weighted gadolinium
contrast-enhanced, T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and
multi-b-value diffusion-weighted acquired at 1.5T or 3.0T. Clinical experts
provided voxel-wise annotations for five disease states on a subset of patients
to establish a training feature vector of 611,930 observations. Then, a
k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) classifier was trained using a 25% hold-out design.
The trained k-NN model was applied to 13,018,171 observations from seventeen
histologically confirmed glioma patients. Linear regression tested overall
survival (OS) relationship to predicted disease compositions (PDC) and
diagnostic age (alpha = 0.05). Canonical discriminant analysis tested if PDC
and diagnostic age could differentiate clinical, genetic, and microscopic
factors (alpha = 0.05).
  Results: The model predicted voxel annotation class with a Dice similarity
coefficient of 94.34% +/- 2.98. Linear combinations of PDCs and diagnostic age
predicted OS (p = 0.008), grade (p = 0.014), and endothelia proliferation (p =
0.003); but fell short predicting gene mutations for TP53BP1 and IDH1.
  Conclusions: This voxel-wise, multi-parametric MRI radiomic strategy holds
potential as a non-invasive decision-making aid for clinicians managing
patients with glioma.

rely on assumptions of equilibrium that are often hard to verify. Instead, we
develop a novel idea that uses the clustering in action space, as a probe of
underlying gravitational potential: the correct potential should maximize
small-scale clustering in the action space. We provide a first-principle
derivation of likelihood using the two-point correlation function in action
space, and test it against simulations of stellar streams. We then apply this
method to the 2nd data release of Gaia, and use it to measure the radial force
fraction $f_h$ and logarithmic slope $\alpha$ of dark matter halo profile. We
investigate stars within 9-11 kpc and 11.5-15 kpc from Galactic centre, and
find $(f_h,\alpha)= (0.391\pm 0.009, 1.835\pm 0.092) $ and $(0.351\pm
0.012,1.687\pm 0.079)$, respectively. We also confirm that the set of
parameters that maximize the likelihood function do correspond to the most
clustering in the action space. The best-fit circular velocity curve for Milky
Way potential is consistent with past measurements (although it is $\sim$
5-10\% lower than previous methods that use masers or globular clusters).
  Our work provides a clear demonstration of the full statistical power that
lies in the full phase space information, relieving the need for {\it ad hoc}
assumptions such as virial equilibrium, circular motion, or steam-finding
algorithms.

approach has raised concerns among professionals with regards to inter- and
intra-variability where clinical diagnosis only has a 30\% positive predictive
value when classifying pathological outcomes. Machine learning models, trained
with FIGO and other user derived features extracted from CTG traces, have been
shown to increase positive predictive capacity and minimise variability. This
is only possible however when class distributions are equal which is rarely the
case in clinical trials where case-control observations are heavily skewed in
favour of normal outcomes. Classes can be balanced using either synthetic data
derived from resampled case training data or by decreasing the number of
control instances. However, this either introduces bias or removes valuable
information. Concerns have also been raised regarding machine learning studies
and their reliance on manually handcrafted features. While this has led to some
interesting results, deriving an optimal set of features is considered to be an
art as well as a science and is often an empirical and time consuming process.
In this paper, we address both of these issues and propose a novel CTG analysis
methodology that a) splits CTG time-series signals into n-size windows with
equal class distributions, and b) automatically extracts features from
time-series windows using a one dimensional convolutional neural network

secrets so well hidden, despite having been studied for decades. In this White
Paper we argue why these secrets are worth unveiling. Jupiter's radiation belts
and the vast magnetosphere that encloses them constitute an unprecedented
physical laboratory, suitable for both interdisciplinary and novel scientific
investigations: from studying fundamental high energy plasma physics processes
which operate throughout the universe, such as adiabatic charged particle
acceleration and nonlinear wave-particle interactions; to exploiting the
astrobiological consequences of energetic particle radiation. The in-situ
exploration of the uninviting environment of Jupiter's radiation belts present
us with many challenges in mission design, science planning, instrumentation
and technology development. We address these challenges by reviewing the
different options that exist for direct and indirect observation of this unique
system. We stress the need for new instruments, the value of synergistic Earth
and Jupiter-based remote sensing and in-situ investigations, and the vital
importance of multi-spacecraft, in-situ measurements. While simultaneous,
multi-point in-situ observations have long become the standard for exploring
electromagnetic interactions in the inner solar system, they have never taken
place at Jupiter or any strongly magnetized planet besides Earth. We conclude
that a dedicated multi-spacecraft mission to Jupiter's radiation belts is an
essential and obvious way forward and deserves to be given a high priority in
ESA's Voyage 2050 programme.

promising due to their true insulating bulk at low temperatures. In this work,
we develop an unconventional Josephson junction by coupling superconducting Nb

current at low temperatures that responds to the application of an out-of-plane
magnetic field with significant deviations from usual Fraunhofer patterns. The
appearance of Shaphiro steps under microwave radiation gives further evidence
of a Josephson effect. Moreover, we explore the effects of Kondo breakdown in
our devices, such as ferromagnetism at the surface and anomalous temperature

show an anomalous hysteresis with the field sweep direction suggesting the

groundwater quality measurements vary for different climates and various human
behaviors, and consequently, their spatial variability can be substantial. In
this paper, we aim to analyze a groundwater dataset from the Golestan province,
Iran, for November 2003 to November 2013. Our target response variable to
monitor the quality of groundwater is the number of counts that the quality of
water is good for a drink. Hence, we are facing spatial count data. Due to the
ubiquity of over or underdispersion in count data, we propose a Bayesian
hierarchical modeling approach based on the renewal theory that relates
nonexponential waiting times between events and the distribution of the counts,
relaxing the assumption of equidispersion at the cost of an additional
parameter. Particularly, we extend the methodology for the analysis of spatial
count data based on the gamma distribution assumption for waiting times. The
model can be formulated as a latent Gaussian model, and therefore, we can carry
out the fast computation by using the integrated nested Laplace approximation
method. The analysis of the groundwater dataset and a simulation study show a
significant improvement over both Poisson and negative binomial models.

drifting Dirac electrons. The effect appears in hydrodynamic regime only due to
reduction of plasmon velocity by electron-electron collisions below the
velocity of carrier drift. To characterize the Cerenkov effect quantitatively,
we analytically find the high-frequency non-local conductivity of drifting
Dirac electrons across the hydrodynamic-to-ballistic crossover. We find the
growth rates of hydrodynamic plasmon instabilities in two experimentally

  based on facial measurements from frontal cephalometric landmarks","17 pages, 17 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Facial analysis permits many investigations some of the most important of
which are craniofacial identification, facial recognition, and age and sex
estimation. In forensics, photo-anthropometry describes the study of facial
growth and allows the identification of patterns in facial skull development by
using a group of cephalometric landmarks to estimate anthropological
information. In several areas, automation of manual procedures has achieved
advantages over and similar measurement confidence as a forensic expert. This
manuscript presents an approach using photo-anthropometric indexes, generated
from frontal faces cephalometric landmarks, to create an artificial neural
network classifier that allows the estimation of anthropological information,
in this specific case age and sex. The work is focused on four tasks: i) sex
estimation over ages from 5 to 22 years old, evaluating the interference of age
on sex estimation; ii) age estimation from photo-anthropometric indexes for
four age intervals (1 year, 2 years, 4 years and 5 years); iii) age group
estimation for thresholds of over 14 and over 18 years old; and; iv) the
provision of a new data set, available for academic purposes only, with a large
and complete set of facial photo-anthropometric points marked and checked by
forensic experts, measured from over 18,000 faces of individuals from Brazil
over the last 4 years. The proposed classifier obtained significant results,
using this new data set, for the sex estimation of individuals over 14 years
old, achieving accuracy values greater than 0.85 by the F_1 measure. For age
estimation, the accuracy results are 0.72 for measure with an age interval of 5
years. For the age group estimation, the measures of accuracy are greater than
0.93 and 0.83 for thresholds of 14 and 18 years, respectively.

(SWNTs) with sp$^{3}$ defects that act as luminescent exciton traps is a
powerful means to enhance their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and to
add optical properties. However, the synthetic methods employed to introduce
these defects are so far limited to aqueous dispersions of surfactant-coated
SWNTs, often with short tube lengths, residual metallic nanotubes and poor film
formation properties. In contrast to that, dispersions of polymer-wrapped SWNTs
in organic solvents feature unrivaled purity, higher PLQY and are easily
processed into thin films for device applications. Here, we introduce a simple
and scalable phase-transfer method to solubilize diazonium salts in organic
nonhalogenated solvents for the controlled reaction with polymer-wrapped SWNTs
to create luminescent aryl defects. Absolute PLQY measurements are applied to
reliably quantify the defect-induced brightening. The optimization of defect
density and trap depth results in PLQYs of up to 4 % with 90 % of photons
emitted through the defect channel. We further reveal the strong impact of
initial SWNT quality and length on the relative brightening by sp$^{3}$
defects. The efficient and simple production of large quantities of
defect-tailored polymer-sorted SWNTs enables aerosol-jet printing and
spin-coating of thin films with bright and nearly reabsorption-free defect
emission, which are desired for carbon nanotube-based near-infrared
light-emitting devices.

the need to maintain a complex information state. Computational challenges are
further compounded if agents do not possess complete model knowledge. In this
paper, we take advantage of the fact that in many problems agents share some
common information, or history, termed partial history sharing. Under this
information structure the policy search space is greatly reduced. We propose a
provably convergent, online tree-search based algorithm that does not require a
closed-form model or explicit communication among agents. Interestingly, our
algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of several existing heuristic
solvers for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes. To
demonstrate the applicability of the model, we propose a novel collaborative

Numerical results demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.

low-resolution spectra ($R \approx 400$) of a transit of WASP-39b using the
ACAM instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope as part of the
LRG-BEASTS survey. Our transmission spectrum is in good agreement with previous
ground- and space-based observations of WASP-39b, and covers a wavelength range
of 4000-9000A. Previous analyses of this exoplanet have retrieved water
abundances that span more than four orders of magnitude, which in turn lead to
conclusions of a subsolar or highly supersolar atmospheric metallicity. In
order to determine the cause of the large discrepancies in the literature
regarding WASP-39b's atmospheric metallicity, we performed retrieval analyses
of all literature data sets. Our retrievals, which assume equilibrium
chemistry, recovered highly supersolar metallicities for all data sets. When
running our retrievals on a combined spectrum, spanning 0.3-5$\mu$m, we
recovered an atmospheric metallicity of $282^{+65}_{-58} \times$ solar. We find
that stellar activity has a negligible effect on the derived abundances and
instead conclude that different assumptions made during retrieval analyses lead
to the reported water abundances that differ by orders of magnitude. This in
turn has significant consequences for the conclusions we draw. This is the
fourth planet to be observed as part of the LRG-BEASTS survey, which is
demonstrating that 4m class telescopes can obtain low-resolution transmission
spectra with precisions of around one atmospheric scale height.

  open boundary conditions",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new method, which we call stochastic fusion, which takes an
exclusion process and constructs an interacting particle systems in which more
than one particle may occupy a lattice site. The construction only requires the
existence of stationary measures of the original exclusion process on a finite
lattice. If the original exclusion process satisfies Markov duality on a finite
lattice, then the construction produces Markov duality functions (for some
initial conditions) for the fused exclusion process. The stochastic fusion
construction is based off of the Rogers-Pitman intertwining.
  In particular, we have results for three types of models:
  1. For symmetric exclusion processes, the fused process and duality functions
are inhomogeneous generalizations of those in \cite{GKRV}. The construction
also allows a general class of open boundary conditions: as an application of
the duality, we find the hydrodynamic limit and stationary measures of the
generalized symmetric simple exclusion process SSEP$(m/2)$ on $\mathbb{Z}_+$
for open boundary conditions.
  2. For the asymmetric simple exclusion process, the fused process and duality
functions are inhomogeneous generalizations of those found in \cite{CGRS} for
the ASEP$(q,j)$. As a by-product of the construction, we show that the
multi-species ASEP$(q,j)$ preserves $q$-exchangeable measures, and use this to
find new duality functions for the ASEP, ASEP$(q,j)$ and $q$-Boson.
Additionally, the construction leads to duality for ASEP with open boundary
conditions. As an application of the latter duality, we find the hydrodynamic
limit.
  3. For dynamic models, we fuse the dynamic ASEP from \cite{BorodinDyn}, and
produce a dynamic and inhomogeneous version of ASEP$(q,j)$. We also apply
stochastic fusion to IRF models and compare them to previously found models.

robots in cluttered environments. Since centralized, coupled planning
algorithms are computationally intractable for large numbers of robots, we
consider decoupled planning, in which robots plan their paths sequentially in
order of priority. Choosing how to prioritize the robots is a key
consideration. State-of-the-art prioritization heuristics, however, do not
model the coupling between a robot's mobility and its environment. In this
paper, we propose a prioritization rule that can be computed online by each
robot independently, and that provides consistent, conflict-free path plans.
Our innovation is to formalize a robot's path prospects to reach its goal from
its current location. To this end, we consider the number of homology classes
of trajectories, and use this as a prioritization rule in our decentralized
path planning algorithm, whenever any robots enter negotiation to deconflict
path plans. This prioritization rule guarantees a partial ordering over the
robot set. We perform simulations that compare our method to five benchmarks,
and show that it reaches the highest success rate (w.r.t. completeness), and
that it strikes the best balance between makespan and flowtime objectives.

multiple sensors distributed spatially in a city). We evaluate our SaSTL
monitor by applying to two case studies with large-scale real city sensing data
(e.g., up to 10,000 sensors in one requirement). The results show that SaSTL
has a much higher coverage expressiveness than other spatial-temporal logics,

requirements. We also demonstrate that the SaSTL monitor can help improve the

the other component is the remaining total variation penalty. Compared with the

on extinction rates, facilitating robustness by creating niche space, but at
the same time increasing the magnitude of extinction cascades. We emphasize the

dust content and/or old stellar populations. This raises the questions of the
true abundance of massive galaxies and the star-formation-rate density in the
early universe. Although several massive galaxies that are invisible in the
ultraviolet have recently been confirmed at early epochs, most of them are
extreme starbursts with star-formation rates exceeding 1000 solar masses per
year, suggesting that they are unlikely to represent the bulk population of
massive galaxies. Here we report submillimeter (wavelength 870um) detections of
39 massive star-forming galaxies at z > 3, which are unseen in the spectral
region from the deepest ultraviolet to the near-infrared. With a space density
of about $2 \times 10^{-5}$ per cubic megaparsec (two orders of magnitudes
higher than extreme starbursts) and star-formation rates of 200 solar masses
per year, these galaxies represent the bulk population of massive galaxies that
have been missed from previous surveys. They contribute a total
star-formation-rate density ten times larger than that of equivalently massive
ultraviolet-bright galaxies at z >3. Residing in the most massive dark matter
halos at their redshifts, they are probably the progenitors of the largest

or more generally display cross-sectional dependence structures that are
governed by observable and unobservable characteristics. Strategic network
formation models are an example. Wether two data points are highly correlated
or not depends on draws from underlying characteristics distributions. The
paper defines a measure of closeness that depends on primitive conditions on
the distribution of observable characteristics as well as functional form of
the underlying model. A summability condition over the probability distribution
of observable characteristics is shown to be a critical ingredient in
establishing limit results. The paper establishes weak and strong laws of large

  Programming",,,"10.1287/opre.2021.2143",,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Inverse linear programming (LP) has received increasing attention due to its
potential to generate efficient optimization formulations that can closely
replicate the behavior of a complex system. However, inversely inferred
parameters and corresponding forward solutions from the existing inverse LP
method can be highly sensitive to noise, errors, and uncertainty in the input
data, limiting its applicability in data-driven settings. We introduce the
notion of inverse and forward stability in inverse LP and propose a novel
inverse LP method that determines a set of objective functions that are stable
under data imperfection and generate solutions close to the relevant subset of
the data. We formulate the inverse model as a mixed-integer program and
elucidate its connection to bi-clique problems, which we exploit to develop
efficient heuristics. We also show how this method can be used for online
learning. We numerically evaluate the stability of the proposed method and
demonstrate its practical use in the diet recommendation and transshipment
applications.

movements trajectory as a piecewise-constant time series signal, assume that a
disaster-induced displacement is exhibited as a level shift from an

identify level shifts in the signal. In contrast to typical methods that are
used to analyse mobility patterns from call detail records, where the aggregate
movements of large groups of individuals are analysed, our method offers the
advantage that no assumptions regarding the destination or duration of an
individual's displacement are necessary. We have applied the method to the
datasets from three disasters - the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2015 Gorkha
earthquake in Nepal, and Hurricane Matthew in Haiti in 2016. Our results
demonstrate that this method can facilitate improvements in the analysis and
modelling of the mobility of internally displaced persons in post-disaster
scenarios, using call detail records. Such analyses can be used to complement
traditional survey methods to assess the scale and characteristics of
disaster-induced displacements in a timely manner.

systems and industrial processes are challenging control engineering problems.
This is mainly because the temperature dynamics is inherently
infinite-dimensional, nonlinear, spatially distributed, and coupled with other
physical processes. Furthermore, the dominant time constants are usually long,
implying that in practice due to various economic and time constraints, we can
only collect a relatively small number of data samples that can be used for
data-driven modeling. Finally, since sensing and actuation of temperature
dynamics are often spatially discrete, special attention needs to be given to
sensor (actuator) placement and identifiability problems. Motivated by these
challenges, in this manuscript, we consider the problem of data-driven modeling
and validation of temperature dynamics. We have developed an experimental setup
consisting of a long aluminum bar whose temperature dynamics is influenced by
spatially distributed heat actuators and whose temperature is sensed by
spatially distributed thermocouples. We address the noise reduction problem and
perform step response and nonlinearity analyses. We combine predictor based
subspace identification methods with time series analysis methods to identify a
multiple-input multiple-output system model. We provide detailed treatments of
model structure selection, validation, and residual analysis problems under
different modeling and prediction scenarios. Our extensive experimental results
show that the temperature dynamics of the experimental setup can be relatively
accurately estimated by low-order models.

vortex is capable of capturing and guiding neutral molecules endowed with a
permanent electric dipole moment (PEDM). Similarly as in the case of the
magnetic field applied to elementary particles or atoms, this effect turns out
to be very delicate because of the small values of PEDM observed in real
molecules. They amount to $2\times10^{5}\, e{\mathrm{fm}}$ (electron charge
$\times$ fermi) or less, which requires the use of very strong electric fields.
It has also been observed that there exists a threshold in field strength above
which the particles are ejected from the trap. Trajectories of guided particles
are usually quite chaotic, which is a consequence of non-linearity of the
equations of motion. With a very special and precise adjustment of parameters,
a regular (i.e., circular, in the transverse plane) trajectory can be obtained.
The presence of an additional constant electric field pointing along the
direction of the wave propagation might help to achieve the necessary tuning
and realize such trajectories.

mobility metrics - two versions of radius of gyration and two versions of
entropy - are used to study the behaviour of populations during three disasters
- the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, and
Hurricane Matthew in Haiti in 2016. We characterise the rate at which a
disrupted population resettles by the fraction of individuals who remain
disrupted each week after the disaster. We find that this rate can be modelled
very well as the sum of two exponential decays and observe that the resettling
rate for all three disasters is similar, with half the original number of
displaced persons having resettled within four to five weeks of the disaster.
If the study of further disasters leads to the observation of similar
exponential decay rates, then it would imply that the number of IDPs at any
time can be inferred from an estimate of the initial number of IDPs immediately
following the disaster. Alternatively, the method provides a way to monitor
disaster resilience and compare recovery rates across disasters. The method has
the advantage that no assumptions need to be made regarding the location or
time of resettlement. Our results indicate that CDRs can significantly
contribute to measuring and predicting displacement durations, distances, and
locations of IDPs in post-disaster scenarios. We believe that information and

""foreground avoidance method"" highly depends on the instrument chromaticity.
The systematic effects induced by the radio-telescope spread the foreground
signal in the delay domain, which contaminates the EoR window theoretically
observable. Applied to the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), this
paper combines detailed electromagnetic and electrical simulations in order to
model the chromatic effects of the instrument, and quantify its frequency and
time responses. In particular, the effects of the analogue receiver,
transmission cables, and mutual coupling are included. These simulations are
able to accurately predict the intensity of the reflections occurring in the
150-m cable which links the antenna to the back-end. They also show that
electromagnetic waves can propagate from one dish to another one through large
sections of the array due to mutual coupling. The simulated system time
response is attenuated by a factor $10^{4}$ after a characteristic delay which
depends on the size of the array and on the antenna position. Ultimately, the
system response is attenuated by a factor $10^{5}$ after 1400 ns because of the
reflections in the cable, which corresponds to characterizable
${k_\parallel}$-modes above 0.7 $h\;\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 150 MHz. Thus, this new
study shows that the detection of the EoR signal with HERA Phase I will be more
challenging than expected. On the other hand, it improves our understanding of
the telescope, which is essential to mitigate the instrument chromaticity.

coordinated cyber-physical attacks (CCPAs) against power grids. A CCPA consists
of a physical attack, such as disconnecting a transmission line, followed by a
coordinated cyber attack that injects false data into the sensor measurements
to mask the effects of the physical attack. Such attacks can lead to
undetectable line outages and cause significant damage to the grid. The main
idea of the proposed approach is to invalidate the knowledge that the attackers
use to mask the effects of the physical attack by actively perturbing the
grid's transmission line reactances using distributed flexible AC transmission
system (D-FACTS) devices. We identify the MTD design criteria in this context
to thwart CCPAs. The proposed MTD design consists of two parts. First, we
identify the subset of links for D-FACTS device deployment that enables the
defender to detect CCPAs against any link in the system. Then, in order to
minimize the defense cost during the system's operational time, we use a
game-theoretic approach to identify the best subset of links (within the
D-FACTS deployment set) to perturb which will provide adequate protection.
Extensive simulations performed using the MATPOWER simulator on IEEE bus
systems verify the effectiveness of our approach in detecting CCPAs and
reducing the operator's defense cost.

coalescence. Following earlier methods used in the Reynolds averaged
Navier--Stokes framework, the droplet breakup due to turbulent fluctuations is
modelled by treating droplet-eddy collisions as in kinetic theory of gases. In
order to also model smaller droplets comparable to or smaller than the
Kolmogorov scale we extend the breakup kernels using a structure function model
that smoothly transitions from the inertial to the viscous range. The model
includes a dimensionless coefficient that is fitted by comparing predictions in
a one-dimensional version of the model with a laboratory experiment of oil
droplet breakup below breaking waves. After initial comparisons of the
one-dimensional model to measurements of oil droplets in an axisymmetric jet,
it is then applied in a three-dimensional LES of a jet in crossflow with large
oil droplets of a single size being released at the source of the jet. We model
the concentration fields using $N_d =15$ bins of discrete droplet sizes and
solve scalar transport equations for each bin. The resulting droplet size
distributions are compared with published experimental data, and good agreement
for the relative size distribution is obtained. The LES results also enable us
to quantify size distribution variability. We find that the probability
distribution functions of key quantities such as the total surface area and the
Sauter mean diameter of oil droplets are highly variable, some displaying
strong non-Gaussian intermittent behavior.

platooning coordination is to regulate the times at which multiple vehicles

  Better Understanding of Crowdsourced Data","12 pages, accepted by World Wide Web Journal",,,,"cs.HC cs.AI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the development of mobile social networks, more and more crowdsourced
data are generated on the Web or collected from real-world sensing. The
fragment, heterogeneous, and noisy nature of online/offline crowdsourced data,
however, makes it difficult to be understood. Traditional content-based
analyzing methods suffer from potential issues such as computational
intensiveness and poor performance. To address them, this paper presents
CrowdMining. In particular, we observe that the knowledge hidden in the process
of data generation, regarding individual/crowd behavior patterns (e.g.,
mobility patterns, community contexts such as social ties and structure) and
crowd-object interaction patterns (flickering or tweeting patterns) are
neglected in crowdsourced data mining. Therefore, a novel approach that
leverages implicit human intelligence (implicit HI) for crowdsourced data
mining and understanding is proposed. Two studies titled CrowdEvent and
CrowdRoute are presented to showcase its usage, where implicit HIs are
extracted either from online or offline crowdsourced data. A generic model for
CrowdMining is further proposed based on a set of existing studies. Experiments
based on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CrowdMining.

gradually typed program could hamper tail-call optimization and, as a result,
worsen the space complexity of the program. To address the problem, they
proposed a space-efficient coercion calculus, which was subsequently improved
by Siek et al. The semantics of these calculi involves eager composition of
run-time checks expressed by coercions to prevent the size of a term from
growing. However, it relies also on a nonstandard reduction rule, which does
not seem easy to implement. In fact, no compiler implementation of gradually
typed languages fully supports the space-efficient semantics faithfully.
  In this paper, we study coercion-passing style, which Herman et al. have
already mentioned, as a technique for straightforward space-efficient
implementation of gradually typed languages. A program in coercion-passing
style passes ""the rest of the run-time checks"" around---just like
continuation-passing style (CPS), in which ""the rest of the computation"" is
passed around---and (unlike CPS) composes coercions eagerly. We give a formal
coercion-passing translation from $\lambda$S by Siek et al. to $\lambda$S$_1$,
which is a new calculus of first-class coercions tailored for coercion-passing
style, and prove correctness of the translation. We also implement our
coercion-passing style transformation for the Grift compiler developed by
Kuhlenschmidt et al. An experimental result shows stack overflow can be
prevented properly at the cost of up to 3 times slower execution for most

benefits of redundancy in practice. We here take one step towards practical
systems by studying queuing systems with bi-modal job service time
distribution. Such distributions have been observed in practice, as can be seen
in, e.g., Google cluster traces. We develop an analogy to a classical urns and
balls problem, and use it to study the queuing time performance of two
non-adaptive classical scheduling policies: random and round-robin. We
introduce new performance indicators in the analogous model, and argue that
they are good predictors of the queuing time in non-adaptive scheduling
policies. We then propose a non-adaptive scheduling policy that is based on
combinatorial designs, and show that it has better performance indicators.
Simulations confirm that the proposed scheduling policy, as the performance
indicators suggest, reduces the queuing times compared to random and
round-robin scheduling.

we do include cuts through unstable states, and ignore cuts through the stable
decay products. If we do this with the unstable ghost resonance at one loop, we
get the correct answer only by using a contour which was originally defined by
Lee and Wick. The quantum effects also provide damping in both the Feynman and
the retarded propagators, leading to stability under perturbations.

due to its various applications. Since the frame-level or segment-level
annotations of untrimmed videos require amounts of labor expenditure, studies
on the weakly-supervised action detection have been springing up. However, most
of existing frameworks rely on Class Activation Sequence (CAS) to localize
actions by minimizing the video-level classification loss, which exploits the
most discriminative parts of actions but ignores the minor regions. In this
paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised framework by adversarial learning
of two modules for eliminating such demerits. Specifically, the first module is
designed as a well-designed Seeded Sequence Growing (SSG) Network for
progressively extending seed regions (namely the highly reliable regions
initialized by a CAS-based framework) to their expected boundaries. The second
module is a specific classifier for mining trivial or incomplete action
regions, which is trained on the shared features after erasing the seeded
regions activated by SSG. In this way, a whole network composed of these two
modules can be trained in an adversarial manner. The goal of the adversary is
to mine features that are difficult for the action classifier. That is, erasion
from SSG will force the classifier to discover minor or even new action regions
on the input feature sequence, and the classifier will drive the seeds to grow,
alternately. At last, we could obtain the action locations and categories from
the well-trained SSG and the classifier. Extensive experiments on two public
benchmarks THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet1.3 demonstrate the impressive performance
of our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-arts.

conductivity in graphene by inducing electron-phonon scattering externally.
With experimentally tunable charge carrier density we find $\sim 50\%$
reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity at 200 K. The present study opens
up new avenues for potential thermoelectric applications of graphene.

imperceptible to human observers but alter the behavior of even the best
performing deep learning models and yield incorrect outputs. Since their
discovery, adversarial examples have drawn significant attention in machine
learning: researchers try to reveal the reasons for their existence and improve
the robustness of machine learning models to adversarial perturbations. The
state-of-the-art defense is the computationally expensive and very time
consuming adversarial training via projected gradient descent (PGD). We
hypothesize that adversarial attacks exploit the open space risk of classic
monotonic activation functions. This paper introduces the tent activation
function with bounded open space risk and shows that tents make deep learning
models more robust to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate on the MNIST dataset
that a classifier with tents yields an average accuracy of 91.8% against six
white-box adversarial attacks, which is more than 15 percentage points above
the state of the art. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our approach improves the
average accuracy against the six white-box adversarial attacks to 73.5% from
41.8% achieved by adversarial training via PGD.

widespread photometric (R-band) variability in the upper Hertzsprung Russell

spectral types. Red stars (V-I>1.5) exhibit larger amplitude fluctuations than
their bluer counterparts. We extract a characteristic variability timescale,
tch, via wavelet transformations that are sensitive to both continuous and
localized fluctuations. Cool supergiants are characterized by longer timescales

of days but cover a wider range, from our resolution limit of a few days to

$W^{0,2}_{2}$ are sensitive to global anisotropic signals present within a
field, and by extracting these statistics from the low redshift matter density
one can place constraints on the redshift space distortion parameter $\beta =
f/b$. We begin by reviewing the calculation of the ensemble expectation values
$\langle W^{0,2}_{1} \rangle$, $\langle W^{0,2}_{2} \rangle $ for isotropic,
Gaussian random fields, then consider how these results are modified by the
presence of a linearly anisotropic signal. Under the assumption that all fields
remain Gaussian, we calculate the anisotropic correction due to redshift space
distortion in a coordinate system aligned with the line of sight, finding
inequality between the diagonal elements of $\langle W^{0,2}_{1} \rangle $,
$\langle W^{0,2}_{2} \rangle $. The ratio of diagonal elements of these
matrices provides a set of statistics that are sensitive only to the redshift
space distortion parameter $\beta$. We estimate the Fisher information that can
be extracted from the Minkowski tensors, and find $W^{0,2}_{1}$ is more
sensitive to $\beta$ than $W^{0,2}_{2}$, and a measurement of $W^{0,2}_{1}$
accurate to $\sim 1\%$ can yield a $\sim 4\%$ constraint on $\beta$. Finally,
we discuss the difference between using the matrix elements of the Minkowski

They often perform safety-critical functions, e.g., personal medical devices,

small, cheap and specialized sensors and/or actuators. They tend to run simple
software and operate under control of a more sophisticated central control
unit. The latter is responsible for the decision-making and orchestrating the
entire system. If devices are left unprotected, consequences of forged sensor
readings or ignored actuation commands can be catastrophic, particularly, in
safety-critical settings. This prompts the following three questions: (1) How
to trust data produced by a simple remote embedded device? and (2) How to
ascertain that this data was produced via execution of expected software?
Furthermore, (3) Is it possible to attain (1) and (2) under the assumption that
all software on the remote device could be modified or compromised?

atmospheric seeing conditions. Such observations are of particular value
because the frequency of their appearance provides an approximate indication of
the prevailing level of solar activity. Unaided-eye sunspot (UES) observations
can be traced back well before the start of telescopic observations of the Sun,
especially in the East Asian historical records. It is therefore important to
compare more modern, UES observations with the results of telescopic sunspot
observations, to gain a better understanding of the nature of the UES records.
A previous comparison of Chinese UES records and Greenwich photo-heliographic
results between 1874 and 1918 indicated that a few of the UES were apparently
not supported by direct photographic evidence of at least one sunspot with a
large area. This article reveals that one of the Chinese unaided-eye
observations had possibly captured the transit of Venus on 9 December 1874. The
Chinese sunspot records on this date are compared with Western sunspot
observations on the same day. It is concluded that sunspots on the solar disk
were quite small and the transit of Venus was probably misinterpreted as a
sunspot by the Chinese local scholars. This case indicates that sunspots or
comparable ""obscuring"" objects with an area as large as 1000 millionths of the
solar disk could easily have been seen with the unaided eye under suitable
seeing conditions. It also confirms the visibility of sunspots near the solar
limb with the unaided eye. This study provides an explanation of the apparent
discrepancy between the Chinese UES observation on 9 December 1874 and the
Western sunspot observations using telescopes, as well as a basis for further
discussion on the negative pairs in 1900 and 1911, apparently without

spacecraft in orbit and on the surface, but many questions remain regarding its
onset, expansion and decay. We model the 2018 global dust storm with the NASA
Ames Mars Global Climate Model to better understand the evolution of the storm
and how the general circulation and finite surface dust reservoirs impact it.
The global dust storm is characterized by the rapid eastward transport of dust
in the equatorial regions and subsequent lifting. We highlight the rapid
transfer of dust between western and eastern hemispheres reservoirs, which may
play an important role in the storm development through the replenishment of
surface dust. Both the Hadley cell circulation and the diurnal cycle of
atmospheric heating increase in intensity with increasing dustiness. Large dust
plumes are predicted during the mature stage of the storm, injecting dust up to
80 km. The water ice cloud condensation level migrates to higher altitudes,
leading to the enrichment of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. In our
simulations, the intensity of the Hadley cell is significantly stronger than
that of non-dusty conditions. This feedback is strongly sensitive to the
radiative properties of dust, which depends on the effective size of the lifted
dust distribution.

  Detection","Accepted in BMVC 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Active learning approaches in computer vision generally involve querying
strong labels for data. However, previous works have shown that weak
supervision can be effective in training models for vision tasks while greatly
reducing annotation costs. Using this knowledge, we propose an adaptive
supervision framework for active learning and demonstrate its effectiveness on
the task of object detection. Instead of directly querying bounding box
annotations (strong labels) for the most informative samples, we first query
weak labels and optimize the model. Using a switching condition, the required
supervision level can be increased. Our framework requires little to no change
in model architecture. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed
framework can be used to train good generalizable models with much lesser
annotation costs than the state of the art active learning approaches for
object detection.

natural snowfall is used to collect and analyze multiple datasets in the near

the wake from a different perspective. Together, these datasets compose a
three-dimensional picture of the near-wake flow, including the effect of the
tower and hub and the variation of instantaneous wake expansion in response to
changes in turbine operation. A region of high-speed flow is observed directly
behind the hub, and a region of low-speed flow appears behind the tower.
Additionally, the hub produces a region of enhanced turbulence in its wake
while the tower reduces turbulence near the ground as it breaks up turbulent
structures in the boundary layer. Analysis of the instantaneous wake behaviour
reveals variations in wake expansion, and even periods of wake contraction,
occurring in response to changes in the angle of attack and blade pitch
gradient. This behaviour is found to depend on the region of operation of the
turbine. These findings can be incorporated into wake models and advanced
control algorithms for wind farm optimization and can be used to validate wind
turbine wake simulations.

is utilized in a wide range of applications. For image processing, FFT computes
on every pixel's value of an image, regardless of their properties in frequency
domain. The Sparse Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) is an innovative algorithm for
discrete Fourier transforms on signals that possess characteristics of the
sparsity in frequency domain. A reference implementation of the algorithm has
been proven to be efficient than modern FFT library in cases of sufficient
sparsity. However, the SFFT implementation has a critical drawback that it only
works reliably for very specific input parameters, especially signal sparsity
$k$, which hinders the extensive application of SFFT. In this paper, we propose

adaptive dynamic tuning and completing the sparse Fourier transform.

steady compressible Euler system in an almost flat finite nozzle ( in the sense
that it is a generic small perturbation of a flat one ), under physical
boundary conditions proposed by Courant-Friedrichs in
\cite{CourantFriedrichs1948}, in which the receiver pressure is prescribed at
the exit of the nozzle. In the resulting free boundary problem, the location of
the shock-front is one of the most desirable information one would like to
determine. However, the location of the normal shock-front in a flat nozzle can
be anywhere in the nozzle so that it provides little information on the
possible location of the shock-front when the nozzle's boundary is perturbed.
So one of the key difficulties in looking for transonic shock solutions is to
determine the shock-front. To this end, a free boundary problem for the
linearized Euler system will be proposed, whose solution will be taken as an
initial approximation for the transonic shock solution. In this paper, a
sufficient condition in terms of the geometry of the nozzle and the given exit
pressure is derived which yields the existence of the solutions to the proposed
free boundary problem. Once an initial approximation is obtained, a further
nonlinear iteration could be constructed and proved to lead to a transonic
shock solution.

However, in smooth region, large weights may be assigned to smaller stencils
due to the lack of high-order derivatives in the smoothness indicator compared
with that of larger stencils, and may degrade the order accuracy and lead too
much numerical dissipation to resolve fine flow structures. In order to cope
with this drawback, based on the stencil selection of WENO-IS [Wang et al.,
IJMF 104 (2018): 20-31], we propose a L2-norm regularized incremental-stencil
WENO scheme. In this method, a new L2-norm regularization is introduced into
the WENO weighting strategy to modulate the weights of incremental-width
stencils by taking account the L2-norm error term. A high-order non-dimensional
discontinuity detector is then utilized as the regularization parameter for
adaptive control. In addition, a hybrid method is adopted to further improve
the performance and the computational efficiency. A number of benchmark cases
suggest that the present scheme achieves very good robustness and
fine-structure resolving capabilities.

massive stars achieve which kind of explosions and how. Observationally, this
question is related to the open puzzles of whether CCSNe can be divided into
distinct types or whether they are drawn from a population with a continuous
set of properties, and of what progenitor characteristics drive the diversity
of observed explosions. Recent developments in wide-field surveys and
rapid-response followup facilities are helping us answer these questions by
providing two new tools: (1) large statistical samples which enable population
studies of the most common SNe, and reveal rare (but extremely informative)
events that question our standard understanding of the explosion physics
involved, and (2) observations of early SNe emission taken shortly after
explosion which carries signatures of the progenitor structure and mass loss
history. Future facilities will increase our capabilities and allow us to
answer many open questions related to these extremely energetic phenomena of

collisions with hydrogen atoms. We investigate the effect of Fe I + H I and Fe
II + H I collisions and their different treatment on the Fe I/Fe II ionisation
equilibrium and Fe abundance determinations for Galactic halo benchmark stars
HD84937, HD122563, and HD140283 and a sample of 38 very metal-poor giants in
the dwarf galaxies with well known distances. We perform the NLTE calculations
for Fe I-II with using quantum-mechanical (QM) rate coefficients for collisions
with H I from Barklem (2018, B18), Yakovleva, Belyaev, and Kraemer (2018,
YBK18), and Yakovleva, Belyaev, and Kraemer (2019). We find that collisions
with H I serve as efficient thermalisation processes for Fe II and the NLTE
abundance corrections for Fe II lines do not exceed 0.02 dex at [Fe/H] > -3 and
reach +0.06~dex at [Fe/H] ~ -4. For given star, the B18 and YBK18 treatments of
Fe I + H I collisions lead to similar average NLTE abundances from Fe I lines,
although there exist discrepancies in the NLTE corrections for individual
lines. With using QM collisional data and the Gaia based surface gravity, we
obtain consistent abundances from Fe I and Fe II for a red giant HD122563. For
HD84937 and HD140283, we study the Fe lines in the visible and the UV

UV lines are consistent. The abundances from Fe I and Fe II agree within 0.10

is achieved for each [Fe/H] > -3.5 star of our dwarf galaxy sample.

indirect interactions mediated by shared exploiters or mutualists. These
interactions are driven either by changes in animal abundance (density-mediated
interactions, e.g., apparent competition), or by changes in animal preferences
for plants (behaviorally-mediated interactions). This article studies effects
of behaviorally-mediated interactions on two plant population dynamics and
animal preference dynamics when animal densities are fixed. Animals can be
either adaptive exploiters or adaptive mutualists (e.g., herbivores or
pollinators) that maximize their fitness. Analysis of the model shows that
adaptive animal preferences for plants can lead to multiple outcomes of plant
coexistence with different levels of specialization or generalism for the
mediator animal species. In particular, exploiter generalism promotes plant
coexistence even when inter-specific competition is too strong to make plant
coexistence possible without exploiters, and mutualist specialization promotes
plant coexistence at alternative stable states when plant inter-specific
competition is weak. Introducing a new concept of generalized isoclines allows
us to fully analyze the model with respect to the strength of competitive
interactions between plants (weak or strong), and the type of interaction
between plants and animals (exploitation or mutualism).

is identical to the fermion-impurity interaction, such that the system is

repulsive interactions, we find no in-medium bound states. Second, we construct
an effective model to describe these interactions, and compare its predictions

obtained, which is more efficient than its nonparametric counterpart for
repeated observations. A multiplier bootstrap modification reduces the variance
of the estimator, and allows estimation of LKCs and EEC of the limiting field
of non-Gaussian fields satisfying a functional CLT. The proposed methods are
evaluated using simulations of 2D fields and illustrated in thresholding of 3D
fMRI brain activation maps and cosmological simulations on the 2-sphere.

simulations faster and more reliable when assessing collisionless fast particle
losses due to magnetic field perturbations. These techniques are based on
identifying various loss channels in constants of motion space using the
so-called loss maps. We demonstrate that this allows one to attribute losses
quantitatively to different transport mechanisms, increase signal-to-noise
ratio when estimating FILD signal and peak power loads, and connect magnetic
field structure directly to fast particle losses. Furthermore, we show that
collisionless fast particle transport can be treated as an advection-diffusion
process where the transport coefficients can be evaluated with the
orbit-following method. Applying these techniques has the potential to make
orbit-following simulations faster to perform, or to avoid them completely,
while making the results more reliable as they become more clearly connected to
underlying physics. We demonstrate these techniques for ITER by showing how
alpha particle losses are affected by various magnetic field perturbations,
estimating ICRH losses in reduced field scenarios, and performing a scan on
alpha particle losses as a function of ELM control coil current phases.

i.e., sources with the highest synchrotron peak frequencies ($\nu_{\rm

Comparing the generated stacked $\gamma$-ray spectrum with the sensitivity
limits of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), we find that the {\it
Fermi}-LAT undetected population of such extreme blazars, on average, may
remain well below the CTA detection threshold due to their faintness and
extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption. However, $\gamma$-ray detected
blazars belonging to the same class are promising candidates for CTA
observations. The EBL corrected stacked spectra of these sources do not show
any softening up to 1 TeV. This finding suggests the inverse Compton peak of
extreme blazars to lie above 1 TeV, thus indicating a hard intrinsic TeV
spectrum. Our analysis also predicts that at 100 GeV, at least $\sim$10\% of
the diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background originates from the
$\gamma$-ray undetected extreme blazars. These results highlight the

outperforms baseline models in both quantitative and qualitative measurements.
We also train the model to synthesize brain disorder MRI data to demonstrate

dark matter models beyond standard CDM. One such alternative is ULDM; extremely
light scalar particles exhibiting wavelike properties on kiloparsec scales.
Astrophysically realistic ULDM halos are expected to consist of inner solitonic
cores embedded in NFW-like outer halos. The presence of the solitonic core
suggests that ULDM may resolve the core-cusp discrepancy associated with pure
NFW halos without recourse to baryonic physics. However, it has been
demonstrated that the density of ULDM halos can exceed those of comparable NFW
configurations at some radii and halo masses, apparently exacerbating the
problem rather than solving it. This situation arises because, although
solitonic cores are flat at their centres, they obey an inverse mass-radius
scaling relationship. Meanwhile, the mass of the inner soliton increases with
the total halo mass, and therefore the inner core becomes more peaked at large
halo masses. We describe a parameterisation of the radial density profiles of
ULDM halos that allows for environmental variability of the core-halo mass
relation in order to investigate this issue in more detail. For halos up to
10^12 solar masses we find feasible ULDM profiles for which the central density
is lower than their NFW counterparts at astrophysically accessible radii.
However, comparisons to observed profiles do not strongly favour either option;
both give reasonable fits to subsets of the data for some parameter choices.
Consequently, we find that robust tests of the core-cusp problem in ULDM will
require more comprehensive observational data and simulations that include
baryonic feedback.

not only depend on temperature and pressure but also on the time dependent
transport of matter, such as radial drift of solid bodies, which could release
water and other volatile species before disintegration or accretion onto a
larger body with potentially considerable implications for the composition of
planets. Aims. We perform a parameter study focused on the water depletion of
different sized bodies able to cross the water snowline by gas induced radial
drift. Methods. Either the analytical Hertz-Knudsen-Langmuir sublimation
formula assuming equilibrium temperature within the body or a more involved,
numerical model for the internal thermal evolution is coupled with an
alpha-disk model. Different properties of the disk and the embedded body are
explored. Results. Bodies with radii up to 100 meter drift faster towards the
central star than the water snowline, hence, cross it. The region that can be
reached before complete disintegration - and is therefore polluted with H2O ice
- extends to 10 percent closer to the star than the snowline location. The
extent of this polluted region could be multiple times larger in the presence
of a dust mantle, which is, however, unlikely to form due to frequent
collisions with smaller-than centimeter sized objects. Conclusions. Given a
significant abundance of meter sized boulders in protoplanetary disks, the
transport of water by radial drift of these bodies towards regions closer to
the star than the snowline is not negligible and this flux of volatiles can be
estimated for a given distribution of solid body sizes and compositions. A
simple expression for surface sublimation is applicable for a homogeneous body

magnetically active disk and were characterized by high surface density and low
effective viscosity. Multiple gaseous rings could form simultaneously in the
dead zone region which were highly dynamical and showed complex, time-dependent
behavior such as inward migration, vortices, gravitational instability and
large-scale spiral waves. An increase in MRI triggering temperature had only
marginal effects, while changes in active layer thickness as well as the

scattering plane with respect to the hadron-interacting plane. We calculate the
two modulations as functions of four kinematic variables, and find that they
provide a very good laboratory to distinguish several models describing the
heavy quarkonium production, including the color-singlet (CS) model, the
nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) associated with the $^1S_0^{[8]}$ dominance
picture, and the NRQCD in which the values of all the three color-octet (CO)

conclusions, we restrict our calculation in a specific kinematic region, where
the CS and CO mechanisms can be distinguished by scrutinizing the values of the

be tested by measuring the values of the $\mathrm{cos}(2\psi)$ modulation.

find that at an integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=1000\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$, the

the inclusion of tidal force, even for a fast SW, the escaping planetary
material forms two streams, propagating towards and away from the star. The
atmospheric escape and related mass loss rate reaching the value of 10^12 gs^-1
appear to be mostly controlled by the stellar gravitational pull. We computed
the column density and dynamics of MgII ions considering three different sets
of SW parameters and XUV fluxes. The simulations enable to compute the
absorption at the position of the Mg h line and to reproduce the times of
ingress and egress. In case of a slow SW and without accounting for tidal
force, the high orbital velocity leads to the formation of a shock
approximately in the direction of the planetary orbital motion. In this case,
mass loss is proportional to the stellar XUV flux. At the same time, ignoring
of tidal effects for WASP-12b is a strong simplification, so the scenario with
a shock, altogether is an unrealistic one.

constructed as an inflation model with manifest general covariance. We show
that $g=G_N H^2/\pi$: the only dimensionless coupling of the Hubble parameter
$H^2$ and the Newton's coupling $G_N$ in Einstein gravity is screened by the
infrared fluctuations of the conformal mode. We evaluate the one-loop $\beta$
function of $g$ with respect to the cosmic time $\log Ht$ as
$\beta(g)=-(1/2)g^2$, i.e., $g$ is asymptotically free toward the future. The
exact $\beta$ function with the backreaction of $g$ reveals the existence of
the ultraviolet fixed point. It indicates that the de Sitter expansion stared
at the Planck scale with a minimal entropy $S=2$. We have identified the de
Sitter entropy $1/g$ with the von Neumann entropy of the conformal zero mode.
The former evolves according to the screening of $g$ and the Gibbons-Hawking
formula. The latter is found to increase by diffusion in the stochastic process
at the horizon in a consistent way. Our Universe is located very close to the
fixed point $g=0$ with a large entropy. We discuss possible physical
implications of our results such as logarithmic decay of dark energy.

{\frac{{|u|}^{ {2^{*}_{s}}(\beta)-2}u}{|x|^{\beta}}}+ \big [ I_{\mu}*

show that problem (\ref{eq0.1}) admits at least a weak solution under some

  To prove the main result, we develop some useful tools based on a weighted
Morrey space. To be precise, we discover the embeddings \begin{equation}
\label{eq0.2} {\dot{H}}^s(\R^{n}) \hookrightarrow
{L}^{2^*_{s}(\alpha)}(\R^{n},|y|^{-\alpha}) \hookrightarrow
L^{p,\frac{n-2s}{2}p+pr}(\R^{n},|y|^{-pr}) \end{equation} where $s \in (0,1)$,
$0<\alpha<2s<n$, $p\in[1,2^*_{s}(\alpha))$, $r=\frac{\alpha}{ 2^*_{s}(\alpha)

  By using mountain pass lemma along with an improved Sobolev inequality, we
obtain a nontrivial weak solution to problem (\ref{eq0.1}) in a direct way. It
is worth while to point out that the improved Sobolev inequality could be
applied to simplify the proof of the main results in \cite{NGSS} and

structure of solids, can be derived from dynamical density functional theory
(DDFT) via a sequence of approximations. Standard derivations neglect a term of
form $\nabla\cdot[n\nabla L n]$, where $n$ is the scaled density profile and
$L$ is a linear operator. We show that this term makes a significant
contribution to the stability of the crystal, and dropping this term from the
theory forces another approximation, that of replacing the logarithmic term
from the ideal gas contribution to the free energy with its truncated Taylor
expansion, to yield a polynomial in $n$. However, the consequences of doing
this are the presence of an additional spinodal in the phase diagram, so the
liquid is predicted first to freeze and then to melt again as the density is
increased; and other periodic structures are erroneously predicted to be
thermodynamic equilibria. A second approximation is to replace $L$ by a
gradient expansion. This leads to the possibility of solutions failing to exist
above a certain value of the average density. We illustrate these conclusions
with a simple model two-dimensional fluid. The consequences of the PFC
approximations are that the phase diagram is both qualitatively incorrect, in
that it has a stripe phase, and quantitatively incorrect (by orders of
magnitude) regarding the properties of the crystal. Thus, although PFC models
are successful as phenomenological models of crystallisation, we find it
impossible to derive the PFC model as an accurate approximation to DDFT,
without introducing spurious artefacts. However, making a simple one-mode
approximation for the logarithm of the density distribution is surprisingly
accurate, which gives a tantalising hint that accurate PFC-type theories may
instead be derived for the field $\log(\rho(x))$, rather than for the density
profile itself.

particular one-form on a closed curve. This curve consists of BMSFT interval
and also null and spacelike geodesics in the bulk gravitational theory.
Exterior derivative of this form is zero when it is calculated for the
flat-space cosmology. However, for a generic perturbation of three-dimensional
global Minkowski spacetime, the exterior derivative of one-form yields Einstein
equation. This is the first step for constructing bulk geometry by using FLEE
in the flat/BMSFT correspondence.

remnant galaxies in order to investigate how the central SMBH mass and the mass
ratio of progenitor galaxies influence escape velocities of recoiling SMBHs.
Our results show that static analytical models of major merger remnant galaxies
overestimate the SMBHs escape velocities. During major mergers violent
relaxation leads to the decrease of galaxy mass and lower potential at large
remnant radii. This process is not depicted in static analytical potential but
clearly seen in our numerical models. Thus, the evolving numerical model is a
more realistic description of dynamical processes in galaxies with merging
SMBHs. We find that SMBH escape velocities in numerical major merger remnant
galaxies can be up to 25 per cent lower compared to those in analytical models.
Consequently, SMBHs in numerical models generally reach greater galactocentric
distances and spend more time on bound orbits outside of the galactic nuclei.
Thus, numerical models predict a greater number of spatially-offset active
galactic nuclei (AGNs).

passive system will eventually relax to an equilibrium state, unaffected by the
magnetic field, an active system subject to a spatially varying Lorentz force
settles into a nonequilibrium steady state characterized by an inhomogeneous
density and divergence-free bulk fluxes. A macroscopic flux of charged active
particles is induced by the gradient of the magnetic field only and does not
require additional symmetric breaking such as density or potential gradients.
This stands in marked contrast to similar phenomena in condensed matter such as
the classical Hall effect. In a confined geometry we observe circulating
fluxes, which can be reversed by inverting the direction of the magnetic field.
Our theoretical approach, based on coarse-graining of the Fokker-Planck
equation, yields analytical results for the density, fluxes, and polarization
in the steady state, all of which are validated by direct computer simulation.
We demonstrate that passive tracer particles can be used to measure the

that the proposed audio-visual CVAE effectively fuses audio and visual

simplified models as part of the preliminary design of artificial satellites
missions. It is commonly approached by averaging procedures that deal with
literal expressions in expanded form. However, there are cases in which the
correct description of the dynamics may require full, contrary to simplified,
potential models, as is, for instance, the case of low-altitude,
high-inclination lunar orbits. In these cases, dealing with literal expressions
is yet possible with the help of modern symbolic algebra systems, for which
memory handling is no longer an issue. Still, the efficient evaluation of the
averaged expressions related to a high fidelity potential is often jeopardized
for the expanded character of the output of the automatic algebraic process,
which unavoidably provides huge expressions that commonly comprise tens of
thousands of literal terms. Rearrangement of the output to generate an
efficient numerical code may solve the problem, but automatization of this kind
of post-processing is a non trivial task due to the ad-hoc heuristic
simplification procedures involved in the optimization process. However, in
those cases in which the coupling of different perturbations is not of
relevance for the analysis, the averaging procedure may preserve the main
features of the structure of the potential model, thus avoiding the need of the
typical blind computer-based brut force perturbation approach. Indeed, we show
how standard recursions in the literature may be used to efficiently replace
the brut force approach, in this way avoiding the need of further
simplification to improve performance evaluation. In particular, Kaula's
seminal recursion formulas for the gravity potential reveal clearly superior to

around a young star is crucial for planet formation theory. But as the mass of
particles above the mm size cannot be assessed observationally, one must ask
how much mass is hidden in bigger objects. We perform 0-d local simulations to
study how the planetesimal to dust and pebble ratio is evolving in time and to
develop an understanding of the potentially existing mass in planetesimals for
a certain amount of dust and pebbles at a given disk age. We perform a
parameter study based on a model considering dust growth, planetesimal
formation and collisional fragmentation of planetesimals, while neglecting
radial transport processes. While at early times, dust is the dominant solid
particle species, there is a phase during which planetesimals make up a
significant portion of the total mass starting at approximately $10^4 - 10^6$
yr. The time of this phase and the maximal total planetesimal mass strongly
depend on the distance to the star $R$, the initial disk mass, and the
efficiency of planetesimal formation $\epsilon$. After approximately $10^6$ yr,
our model predicts planetesimal collisions to dominate, which resupplies small
particles. In our model, planetesimals form fast and everywhere in the disk.
For a given $\epsilon$, we were able to relate the dust content and mass of a

  1. We establish $p=\frac{\log n}{k}$ as a sharp threshold for having NMP in
$\mathbb{G}(k,n,p)$, which is the graph with $|X|=k,|Y|=n$ (assuming $k\le
n\leq \exp(o(k))$), and in which each pair $(x,y)\in X\times Y$ is an edge
independently with probability $p$. This generalizes a classic result of
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi on the $\frac{\log n}{n}$ threshold for having a perfect
matching in $\mathbb{G}(n,n,p)$.
  2. We also show that a pseudorandom bipartite graph - upon deletion of a
vanishingly small fraction of vertices - admits NMP, provided it is not too
sparse. More precisely, a bipartite graph $G(X,Y)$, with $k=|X|\le |Y|=n$, is
said to be Thomason pseudorandom (following A. Thomason (Discrete Math., 1989))
with parameters $(p,\varepsilon)$ if each $x\in X$ has degree at least $pn$ and
each pair of distinct $x, x'\in X$ has at most $(1+\varepsilon)p^2n$ common
neighbors. We show that for any large enough $(p,\varepsilon)$-Thomason
pseudorandom graph $G(X,Y)$, there are ""tiny"" subsets $\mathrm{Del}_X\subset X,
\ \mathrm{Del}_Y\subset Y$ such that the subgraph $G(X\setminus
\mathrm{Del}_X,Y\setminus \mathrm{Del}_Y)$ has NMP, provided $p
\gg\tfrac{1}{k}$. En route, we prove an ""almost"" vertex decomposition theorem:
Every such Thomason pseudorandom graph admits - excluding a negligible portion
of its vertex set - a partition of its vertex set into graphs that we call
Euclidean trees. These are trees that have NMP, and which arise organically
through the Euclidean GCD algorithm.

galaxies via feedback in the form of wide-angle wind-driven outflows. These
establish the observed correlations between supermassive black hole (SMBH)
masses and host galaxy properties, e.g. the spheroid velocity dispersion
$\sigma$. In this paper we consider the growth of the SMBH once it starts
driving a large-scale outflow through the galaxy. To clear the gas and
ultimately terminate further growth of both the SMBH and the host galaxy, the
black hole must continue to grow its mass significantly, by up to a factor of a
few, after reaching this point. The mass increment $\Delta M_{\rm BH}$ depends
sensitively on both galaxy size and SMBH spin. The galaxy size dependence leads
to $\Delta M_{\rm BH} \propto \sigma^5$ and a steepening of the $M-\sigma$
relation beyond the analytically calculated $M \propto \sigma^4$, in agreement
with observation. Slowly--spinning black holes are much less efficient in
producing feedback, so at any given $\sigma$ the slowest--spinning black holes
should be the most massive. Current observational constraints are consistent
with this picture, but insufficient to test it properly; however, this should
change with upcoming surveys.

encoder-decoder framework with attention mechanisms, which have achieved
remarkable progress. However, such a framework does not consider scene concepts
to attend visual information, which leads to sentence bias in caption
generation and defects the performance correspondingly. We argue that such
scene concepts capture higher-level visual semantics and serve as an important
cue in describing images. In this paper, we propose a novel scene-based
factored attention module for image captioning. Specifically, the proposed
module first embeds the scene concepts into factored weights explicitly and
attends the visual information extracted from the input image. Then, an
adaptive LSTM is used to generate captions for specific scene types.
Experimental results on Microsoft COCO benchmark show that the proposed
scene-based attention module improves model performance a lot, which
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under various evaluation metrics.

depth, motion and semantic information of the dynamic scene as a 1D energy
minimization problem based on optical flow estimates, pixel-wise semantic
segmentation and camera motion. The optical flow of a stixel is described by a

the KITTI 2015 dataset that mono-stixels provide a compact and reliable depth

the suppression of the YBCO twinning domains, and the preferential alignment of
the CuO chains along one of the in-plane directions of the substrate. Because
of the large mismatch between the in-plane lattice parameters of film and

unidirectional buckling of the atomic planes, along the chains' direction, due
to a deformation of the copper-oxygen octahedra. The YBCO films, which can be
grown with thicknesses down to few unit cells and oxygen doping levels spanning

down to 50 nm. The anisotropies due to the untwinning state are preserved in

holographic duality to Type II string theory in asymptotically linear dilaton
backgrounds. We focus on backgrounds with a large number of Killing vectors
(namely, products of maximally symmetric spaces), without requiring
supersymmetry (we do not turn on any background fields except the metric). LST
is non-local so it is not obvious which spaces it can be defined on; we show
that holography implies that the theory cannot be put on negatively curved
spaces, but only on spaces with zero or positive curvature. For example, one
cannot put LST on a product of an anti-de Sitter space times another space,
without turning on extra background fields. On spaces with positive curvature,
such as $S^6$, $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^4$, $S^3\times S^3$, etc., we typically
find (for large $N$) dual holographic backgrounds which are weakly coupled and
weakly curved everywhere, so that they can be well-described by Type II
supergravity. In some cases more than one smooth solution exists for LST on the
same space, and they all contribute to the partition function. We also study
the thermodynamical properties of LST compactified on spheres, finding the
leading correction to the Hagedorn behavior of the spectrum, which is different
on curved space than on flat space. We discuss the holographic renormalization
procedure, which must be implemented in order to get a finite free energy for
the LST; we do not know how to implement it for general spaces, but we can (and

planetary science. Although the geologic evidence generally supports a warmer
and wetter climate, climate models have had difficulty simulating such a
scenario, leading some to suggest that the observed fluvial geology (e.g.
valley networks, modified landscapes) on the Martian surface, could have formed
in a cold climate instead. However, as we have originally predicted using a
single-column radiative-convective climate model [Ramirez et al. 2014a],
warming from CO2-H2 collision-induced absorption (CIA) on a volcanically active
early Mars could have raised mean surface temperatures above the freezing
point, with later calculations showing that this is achievable with hydrogen
concentrations as low as ~1%. Nevertheless, these predictions should be tested
against more complex models. Here, we use an advanced energy balance model that
includes a northern lowlands ocean to show that mean surface temperatures near
or slightly above the freezing point of water were necessary to carve the
valley networks. Our scenario is consistent with a relatively large ocean as
has been suggested. Valley network distributions would have been global prior
to subsequent removal processes. At lower mean surface temperatures and smaller
ocean sizes, precipitation and surface erosion efficiency diminish. The warm
period may have been ~< 10 million years, perhaps suggesting that episodic
warming mechanisms were not needed. Atmospheric collapse and permanently
glaciated conditions occur once surface ice coverage exceeds a threshold

performance in image superresolution (SR), their computational cost increases
geometrically as CNN models get deeper and wider. Meanwhile, the features of
intermediate layers are treated equally across the channel, thus hindering the
representational capability of CNNs. In this paper, we propose an
attention-aware linear depthwise network to address the problems for single
image SR, named ALDNet. Specifically, linear depthwise convolution allows
CNN-based SR models to preserve useful information for reconstructing a
super-resolved image while reducing computational burden. Furthermore, we
design an attention-aware branch that enhances the representation ability of
depthwise convolution layers by making full use of depthwise filter
interdependency. Experiments on publicly available benchmark datasets show that
ALDNet achieves superior performance to traditional depthwise separable
convolutions in terms of quantitative measurements and visual quality.

this work, we show that temporal filtering of single-photon pulses enables a

influence of temporal filtering of sub-Poissonian single-photon pulses on the

triggered solid-state single-photon source and a receiver module designed for
four-state polarization coding via the BB84 protocol. Furthermore, we
demonstrate real-time security monitoring by analyzing the photon statistics,
in terms of $g^{(2)}(0)$, inside the quantum channel by correlating the photon
flux recorded at the four ports of our receiver. Our findings are useful for
the certification of QKD and can be applied and further extended for the
optimization of various implementations of quantum communication based on

  flow considerations","15 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper uses supervised learning, random search and deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) methods to control large signalized intersection networks. The
traffic model is Cellular Automaton rule 184, which has been shown to be a
parameter-free representation of traffic flow, and is the most efficient
implementation of the Kinematic Wave model with triangular fundamental diagram.
We are interested in the steady-state performance of the system, both spatially
and temporally: we consider a homogeneous grid network inscribed on a torus,
which makes the network boundary-free, and drivers choose random routes. As a
benchmark we use the longest-queue-first (LQF) greedy algorithm. We find that:
(i) a policy trained with supervised learning with only two examples
outperforms LQF, (ii) random search is able to generate near-optimal policies,
(iii) the prevailing average network occupancy during training is the major
determinant of the effectiveness of DRL policies. When trained under free-flow
conditions one obtains DRL policies that are optimal for all traffic
conditions, but this performance deteriorates as the occupancy during training
increases. For occupancies > 75% during training, DRL policies perform very
poorly for all traffic conditions, which means that DRL methods cannot learn
under highly congested conditions. We conjecture that DRL's inability to learn
under congestion might be explained by a property of urban networks found here,
whereby even a very bad policy produces an intersection throughput higher than
downstream capacity. This means that the actual throughput tends to be
independent of the policy. Our findings imply that it is advisable for current
DRL methods in the literature to discard any congested data when training, and
that doing this will improve their performance under all traffic conditions.

particular, it serves as a building block in many replication based
fault-tolerant systems and in particular in multiple recent blockchain
solutions. Depending on its exact variant and other environmental assumptions,
solving consensus requires multiple communication rounds. Yet, there are known
optimistic protocols that guarantee termination in a single communication round
under favorable conditions.
  In this paper we present a generic optimizer than can turn any consensus
protocol into an optimized protocol that terminates in a single communication
round whenever all nodes start with the same predetermined value and no
Byzantine failures occur (although node crashes are allowed). This is
regardless of the network timing assumptions and additional oracle capabilities
assumed by the base consensus protocol being optimized.
  In the case of benign failures, our optimizer works whenever the number of
faulty nodes $f<n/2$. For Byzantine behavior, our optimizer's resiliency
depends on the validity variant sought. In the case of classical validity, it
can accommodate $f<n/4$ Byzantine failures. With the more recent external
validity function assumption, it works whenever $f<n/3$. Either way, our
optimizer only relies on oral messages, thereby imposing very light-weight
crypto requirements.

between two solid bodies. Under static conditions both quantities increase
logarithmically in time, a phenomenon coined aging. Indeed, frictional strength
is traditionally considered equivalent to the real area of contact. Here we
show that this equivalence breaks down when a static shear load is applied
during aging. The addition of such a shear load accelerates frictional aging
while the aging rate of the real area of contact is unaffected. Moreover, a
negative static shear - pulling instead of pushing - slows frictional aging,
but similarly does not affect the aging of contacts. The origin of this shear
effect on aging is geometrical. When shear load is increased, minute relative
tilts between the two blocks prematurely erase interfacial memory prior to
sliding, negating the effect of aging. Modifying the loading point of the
interface eliminates these tilts and as a result frictional aging rate becomes
insensitive to shear. We also identify a secondary memory-erasure effect that
remains even when all tilts are eliminated and show that this effect can be
leveraged to accelerate aging by cycling between two static shear loads.

tested through experiments using the experimental database for vertical upward

spectrogram is the most popular choice for representing speech, which is fed as

simultaneously. On the other hand, the recently proposed single frequency
filtering (SFF) spectrogram promises to be a better alternative because it
captures both time and frequency resolutions simultaneously. In this work, we
explore the SFF spectrogram as an alternative representation of speech for SER.
We have modified the SFF spectrogram by taking the average of the amplitudes of
all the samples between two successive glottal closure instants (GCI)
locations. The duration between two successive GCI locations gives the pitch,
motivating us to name the modified SFF spectrogram as pitch-synchronous SFF
spectrogram. The GCI locations were detected using zero frequency filtering
approach. The proposed pitch-synchronous SFF spectrogram produced accuracy
values of 63.95% (unweighted) and 70.4% (weighted) on the IEMOCAP dataset.
These correspond to an improvement of +7.35% (unweighted) and +4.3% (weighted)

find that the cooperation prevalence in the multi-agent AI is amazing of an
equal level as in the traditional EG in most cases. However, in the snowdrift
games with RL we also reveal that explosive cooperation appears in the form of
periodic oscillation, and we study the impact of the payoff structure on its
emergence. Finally, we show that the periodic oscillation can also be observed
in some other EGs with the RL algorithm, such as the rock-paper-scissors game.

are encountered in statistics and machine learning, business, and engineering.
In data-rich environments, the SOEC objective and constraints contain
expectations defined with respect to large datasets. Therefore, efficient
algorithms for solving such SOECs need to limit the fraction of data points
that they use, which we refer to as algorithmic data complexity. Recent
stochastic first order methods exhibit low data complexity when handling SOECs
but guarantee near-feasibility and near-optimality only at convergence. These
methods may thus return highly infeasible solutions when heuristically
terminated, as is often the case, due to theoretical convergence criteria being
highly conservative. This issue limits the use of first order methods in
several applications where the SOEC constraints encode implementation
requirements. We design a stochastic feasible level set method (SFLS) for SOECs
that has low data complexity and emphasizes feasibility before convergence.
Specifically, our level-set method solves a root-finding problem by calling a
novel first order oracle that computes a stochastic upper bound on the
level-set function by extending mirror descent and online validation
techniques. We establish that SFLS maintains a high-probability feasible
solution at each root-finding iteration and exhibits favorable iteration
complexity compared to state-of-the-art deterministic feasible level set and
stochastic subgradient methods. Numerical experiments on three diverse
applications validate the low data complexity of SFLS relative to the former
approach and highlight how SFLS finds feasible solutions with small optimality
gaps significantly faster than the latter method.

generated from digital services by companies above a certain size. While there
is a lot of political debate about economic consequences of this action, it is
actually interesting to reverse the question: We consider the long-term
implications of an economy with no such digital tax. More generally, we can
think of digital services as a special case of products with low or zero cost
of transportation. With basic economic models we show that a market with no
transportation costs is prone to monopolization as minuscule, random
differences in quality are rewarded disproportionally. We then propose a
distance-based tax to counter-balance the tendencies of random centralisation.
Unlike a tax that scales with physical (cardinal) distance, a ranked (ordinal)
distance tax leverages the benefits of digitalization while maintaining a
stable economy.

field is still difficult to access for new researchers, especially those
without a significant musical background: few introductory materials are
available, and furthermore the field has struggled with defining itself and
building a shared terminology. In this tutorial, we address these shortcomings
by (1) providing a robust definition of OMR and its relationship to related
fields, (2) analyzing how OMR inverts the music encoding process to recover the
musical notation and the musical semantics from documents, (3) proposing a
taxonomy of OMR, with most notably a novel taxonomy of applications.
Additionally, we discuss how deep learning affects modern OMR research, as
opposed to the traditional pipeline. Based on this work, the reader should be
able to attain a basic understanding of OMR: its objectives, its inherent
structure, its relationship to other fields, the state of the art, and the
research opportunities it affords.

reviewing the inspiral-plunge transition phase in extreme mass ratio binaries.
We study the relativistic motion of a compact object (CO) of mass $m$ around a
massive black hole of mass $M\gg m$. The Kerr-Newman metric, effective
potential for the general case of elliptical orbits, gravitational radiation,
orbital energy and angular momentum of a coalescing CO in Kerr spacetime and
gravitational wave frequency and signal to noise ratio are briefly reviewed.
The main focus is on the transition from inspiral to plunge for a CO assuming
that a test particle approach is plausible in the regime $m\ll M$ without
appealing to a perturbative analysis. The effective potential is used to obtain
the properties of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) near which the
adiabatic inspiral phase ends abruptly and the CO enters the plunge phase. For
the transition phase, the effective potential is expanded in terms of
parameters such as the radial (coordinate) distance from the ISCO and the
deviation of particle's angular momentum from its value at the ISCO to obtain
the equation of motion. The equations of motion, during the inspiral and
transition phases, are joined numerically and the gravitational wave frequency,
number of wave cycles and signal to noise ratio (SN) during the transition is
obtained for circular/inclined as well as elliptical/inclined orbits. The
limitations and inaccuracies of the current methods used to approach this
problem is discussed. A short introduction to the fundamental concepts of
General Relativity, in particular Einstein Field Equations is also provided in
the Appendix.

trembling of photon spheres (Rp=3M) of newly formed compact objects and not
from the trembling of their event horizons (R=2M). Further, the tentative
evidences for late time echoes in GWs might be signatures of horizonless
compact objects rather than vacuum black holes (BHs). Similarly, even for an
ideal BH, the radius of its shadow is R_shad = \sqrt{3}Rp is actually the
gravitationally lensed shadow of its photon sphere. Accordingly any compact
object having R \geq R = 3M would generate similar shadow. Thus, no observation
has ever detected any event horizon or any exact BH. Also note that the
magnetic field embedded in the accreting plasma close to the compact object is
expected to have a radial pattern of B \sim 1/r while the stronger BHM dipole
magnetic field should fall off as B \sim 1/r3. Accordingly it has been
suggested that one may try to infer the true nature of the so-called
astrophysical BHs by studying the radial pattern of the magnetic field in their
vicinity. But here we highlight that close to the surface of BHMs, the magnetic
field pattern differs significantly from the same for non-relativistic dipoles.
In particular, we point out that for ultra-compact BHMs, the polar field is
weaker than the equatorial field by an extremely large factor of \sim
z_s/lnz_s, where z_s>>1 is the surface gravitational redshift. We suggest that
by studying the of radial variation as well as significant angular asymmetry of
magnetic field structure near the compact object, future observations might
differentiate a theoretical black hole from a astrophysical BH mimicker. This
study also shows that even if some BHMs would be hypothesized to possess
magnetic fields even stronger than that of magnetars, in certain cases, they
may effectively behave as atoll type neutron stars possessing extremely low
magnetic fields.

the stock market. Numerous approaches were developed to accurately predict
future trends in stock prices. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
utilizing graph-structured data in computer science research communities.
Methods that use relational data for stock market prediction have been recently
proposed, but they are still in their infancy. First, the quality of collected
information from different types of relations can vary considerably. No
existing work has focused on the effect of using different types of relations
on stock market prediction or finding an effective way to selectively aggregate
information on different relation types. Furthermore, existing works have
focused on only individual stock prediction which is similar to the node
classification task. To address this, we propose a hierarchical attention
network for stock prediction (HATS) which uses relational data for stock market
prediction. Our HATS method selectively aggregates information on different
relation types and adds the information to the representations of each company.
Specifically, node representations are initialized with features extracted from
a feature extraction module. HATS is used as a relational modeling module with
initialized node representations. Then, node representations with the added
information are fed into a task-specific layer. Our method is used for
predicting not only individual stock prices but also market index movements,
which is similar to the graph classification task. The experimental results
show that performance can change depending on the relational data used. HATS
which can automatically select information outperformed all the existing
methods.

scalability of existing DNN verification techniques through DNN refactoring. A
DNN refactoring defines (a) the transformation of the DNN's architecture, i.e.,
the number and size of its layers, and (b) the distillation of the learned
relationships between the input features and function outputs of the original
to train the transformed network. Unlike with traditional code refactoring, DNN
refactoring does not guarantee functional equivalence of the two networks, but
rather it aims to preserve the accuracy of the original network while producing
a simpler network that is amenable to more efficient property verification. We
present an automated framework for DNN refactoring, and demonstrate its
potential effectiveness through three case studies on networks used in
