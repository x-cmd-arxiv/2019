nontrivial correlations (otherwise known as ""entanglement"") between the
constituent neutrinos of the many-body system, such as the entanglement entropy
and the Bloch vector of the reduced density matrix. The relevance of going
beyond the mean field is demonstrated by comparisons between the evolution of
the neutrino state in the many-body picture vs the mean-field limit, for
different initial conditions.

infrastructural planning and economics to the spread of diseases and crime.
Representing the system as a complex network, in which nodes are assigned to
regions (e.g., a city) and links indicate the flow of people between two of
them, physics-inspired models have been proposed to quantify the number of
people migrating from one city to the other. Despite the advances made by these
models, our ability to predict the number of commuters and reconstruct mobility
networks remains limited. Here, we propose an alternative approach using
machine learning and 22 urban indicators to predict the flow of people and
reconstruct the intercity commuters network. Our results reveal that
predictions based on machine learning algorithms and urban indicators can
reconstruct the commuters network with 90.4% of accuracy and describe 77.6% of
the variance observed in the flow of people between cities. We also identify
essential features to recover the network structure and the urban indicators
mostly related to commuting patterns. As previously reported, distance plays a
significant role in commuting, but other indicators, such as Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) and unemployment rate, are also driven-forces for people to
commute. We believe that our results shed new lights on the modeling of
migration and reinforce the role of urban indicators on commuting patterns.
Also, because link-prediction and network reconstruction are still open
challenges in network science, our results have implications in other areas,
like economics, social sciences, and biology, where node attributes can give us
information about the existence of links connecting entities in the network.

internal or external control requires a fundamental understanding of the
relationship between neural connectivity and activity. Network control theory
is a powerful tool from the physical and engineering sciences that can provide
insights regarding that relationship; it formalizes the study of how the
dynamics of a complex system can arise from its underlying structure of
interconnected units. Given the recent use of network control theory in
neuroscience, it is now timely to offer a practical guide to methodological
considerations in the controllability of structural brain networks. Here we
provide a systematic overview of the framework, examine the impact of modeling
choices on frequently studied control metrics, and suggest potentially useful
theoretical extensions. We ground our discussions, numerical demonstrations,
and theoretical advances in a dataset of high-resolution diffusion imaging with
730 diffusion directions acquired over approximately 1 hour of scanning from
ten healthy young adults. Following a didactic introduction of the theory, we
probe how a selection of modeling choices affects four common statistics:
average controllability, modal controllability, minimum control energy, and
optimal control energy. Next, we extend the current state of the art in two
ways: first, by developing an alternative measure of structural connectivity
that accounts for radial propagation of activity through abutting tissue, and
second, by defining a complementary metric quantifying the complexity of the
energy landscape of a system. We close with specific modeling recommendations
and a discussion of methodological constraints.

efficiency is ~50 times larger than the theoretical limit for a resonantly
driven antenna is demonstrated. The antenna is composed of magnetostrictive
nanomagnets deposited on a piezoelectric substrate. The nanomagnets are
partially in contact with a heavy metal (Pt) nanostrip. Passage of alternating
current through the nanostrip exerts alternating spin-orbit torque on the
nanomagnets and periodically rotates their magnetizations. During the rotation,
the magnetostrictive nanomagnets expand and contract, thereby setting up
alternating tensile and compressive strain in the piezoelectric substrate
underneath. This leads to the generation of a surface acoustic wave in the
substrate and makes the nanomagnet assembly act as an acoustic antenna. The
measured radiation efficiency of this acoustic antenna at the detected
frequency is ~1%, while the wavelength to antenna dimension ratio is ~ 67:1.
For a standard antenna driven at acoustic resonance, the efficiency would have
been limited to ~ (1/67)^2 = 0.02%. It was possible to beat that limit (by ~50
times) via actuating the antenna not by acoustic resonance, but by using a
completely different mechanism involving spin-orbit torque originating from the

edge weights that characterize performance metrics such as loss and delay.
Network tomography aims to infer these edge weights from their pathwise

established conditions under which the underlying directed graph can be
recovered exactly the pairwise Path Correlation Data, namely, the set of
weights of intersection of each pair of directed paths to and from each

view of the set of network paths to and from each endpoint to reconstruct the
underlying network.
  However, in practice the PCD is not consistently determined by path
measurements. Statistical fluctuations give rise to inconsistent inferred
weight of edges from measurement based on different endpoints, as do
operational constraints on synchronization, and deviations from the underlying
packet transmission model. Furthermore, ad hoc solutions to eliminate noise,
such as pruning small weight inferred links, are hard to apply in a consistent
manner that preserves known end-to-end metric values.
  This paper takes a unified approach to the problem of inconsistent weight
estimation. We formulate two type of inconsistency: \textsl{intrinsic}, when
the weight set is internally inconsistent, and \textsl{extrinsic}, when they
are inconsistent with a set of known end-to-end path metrics. In both cases we
map inconsistent weight to consistent PCD within a least-squares framework. We
evaluate the performance of this mapping in composition with tree-based

symmetry breaking, the number density of axions, and hence the dark matter
density, depends on the length of string per unit volume at cosmic time $t$, by
convention written $\zeta/t^2$. The expectation has been that the dimensionless
parameter $\zeta$ tends to a constant $\zeta_0$, a feature of a string network
known as scaling. It has recently been claimed that in larger numerical
simulations $\zeta$ shows a logarithmic increase with time, while theoretical
modelling suggests an inverse logarithmic correction. Either case would result
in a large enhancement of the string density at the QCD transition, and a
substantial revision to the axion mass required for the axion to constitute all
of the dark matter. With a set of new simulations of global strings we compare
the standard scaling (constant-$\zeta$) model to the logarithmic growth and
inverse-logarithmic correction models. In the standard scaling model, by
fitting to linear growth in the mean string separation $\xi = t/\sqrt{\zeta}$,
we find $\zeta_0 = 1.19 \pm 0.20$. We conclude that the apparent corrections to
$\zeta$ are artefacts of the initial conditions, rather than a property of the
scaling network. The residuals from the constant-$\zeta$ (linear $\xi$) fit
also show no evidence for logarithmic growth, restoring confidence that
numerical simulations can be simply extrapolated from the Peccei-Quinn
symmetry-breaking scale to the QCD scale. Re-analysis of previous work on the
axion number density suggests that recent estimates of the axion dark matter
mass in the post-inflationary symmetry-breaking scenario we study should be
increased by about 50%.

gained popularity and grown in terms of complexity, their use in chemical
kinetics has been impeded by the low performance of current KMC algorithms. The
origins of the additional computational cost in KMC simulations with lateral
interactions are traced back to the more elaborate Cluster Expansion
Hamiltonian, the more extensive rate updating, and to the impracticality of
rate-catalog-based algorithms for interacting adsorbate systems. Favoring
instead site-based algorithms, we propose three ways to reduce the cost of KMC
simulations: 1. Represent the lattice energy by a smaller Supercluster
Hamiltonian without loss of accuracy, 2. employing Subtraction Schemes for
updating key quantities in the simulation that undergo only small, local
changes during a reaction event, and 3. applying efficient search algorithms
from a set of established methods (Supersite Approach). The resulting algorithm
is fixed-cost with respect to the number of lattice sites for practical lattice
sizes and scales with the square of the range of lateral interactions. The
overall added cost of including a complex lateral interaction model amounts to
less than a factor 3. Practical issues in implementation due to finite
numerical accuracy are discussed in detail, and further suggestions for
treating long-range lateral interactions are made. We conclude that, while KMC
simulations with complex lateral interaction models are challenging, these
challenges can be overcome by modifying the established Variable Step Size
Method by employing the Supercluster, Subtraction and Supersite algorithms

randomly assigned to receive treatment or control, and then the outcomes in

experiments need to be executed over several time periods such that treatment
assignment happens at each time period. In such temporal experiments, it has
been observed that the effects of an intervention on a given unit may be large
when the unit is first exposed to it, but then it often attenuates, or even
vanishes, after repeated exposures. This phenomenon is typically due to units'
habituation to the intervention, or some other general form of learning, such
as when users gradually start to ignore repeated mails sent by a promotional
campaign. This paper proposes randomized designs for estimating causal effects
in temporal experiments when habituation is present. We show that our designs

Network (SANN) that models the way neuromodulators such as dopamine and
noradrenaline affect neural dynamics in the human brain by being distributed
diffusely through neocortical regions, allowing both salience signals to
modulate cognition immediately, and one time learning to take place through
strengthening entire patterns of activation at one go. We present a model that
is capable of one-time salience tagging in a neural network trained to classify
objects, and returns a salience response during classification (inference). We
explore the effects of salience on learning via its effect on the activation
functions of each node, as well as on the strength of weights between nodes in
the network. We demonstrate that salience tagging can improve classification
confidence for both the individual image as well as the class of images it
belongs to. We also show that the computation impact of producing a salience
response is minimal. This research serves as a proof of concept, and could be
the first step towards introducing salience tagging into Deep Learning Networks
and robotics.

from the FMT wing (H-alpha$\pm0.8$~{\AA}) observations, which are used to
examine the downward/upward motion of the plasma in the chromosphere. Our
findings reveal that the downward motion of the chromospheric material at the
front of the Moreton wave attains a maximum velocity of 4 km/s, whereas the
propagation speed ranges between 640 and 859 km/s. Furthermore, utilizing the
weak shock approximation in conjunction with the velocity amplitude of the
chromospheric motion induced by the Moreton wave, we derive the Mach number of
the incident shock in the corona. We also performed the temperature-emission
measure analysis of the coronal wave based on the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly

estimate the Alfv\'en and fast-mode Mach numbers of the order of 1.06-1.28 and

responded to the change in the solar wind. Earth's magnetosphere is simulated
using 3D magnetohydrodynamic models that incorporate the evolving local
properties of the solar wind. The solar wind, on the other hand, is modelled in
1.5D for a range of rotation rates Omega from 50 to 0.8 times the present-day
solar rotation (Omega_sun). Our solar wind model uses empirical values for
magnetic field strengths, base temperature and density, which are derived from
observations of solar-like stars. We find that for rotation rates ~10
Omega_sun, Earth's magnetosphere was substantially smaller than it is today,
exhibiting a strong bow shock. As the sun spins down, the magnetopause standoff
distance varies with Omega^{-0.27} for higher rotation rates (early ages, > 1.4
Omega_sun), and with Omega^{-2.04} for lower rotation rates (older ages, < 1.4
Omega_sun). This break is a result of the empirical properties adopted for the
solar wind evolution. We also see a linear relationship between magnetopause
distance and the thickness of the shock on the subsolar line for the majority
of the evolution (< 10 Omega_sun). It is possible that a young fast rotating
Sun would have had rotation rates as high as 30 to 50 Omega_sun. In these
speculative scenarios, at 30 Omega_sun, a weak shock would have been formed,
but for 50 Omega_sun, we find that no bow shock could be present around Earth's
magnetosphere. This implies that with the Sun continuing to spin down, a strong
shock would have developed around our planet, and remained for most of the
duration of the solar main sequence.

comprise various types of multilingual bottleneck features (BNFs) that are
obtained via multi-task learning of deep neural networks (MTL-DNN). One of the
key problems is how to acquire high-quality frame labels for untranscribed
training data to facilitate supervised DNN training. It is shown that learning
of robust BNF representations can be achieved by effectively leveraging
transcribed speech data and well-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems from one or more out-of-domain (resource-rich) languages. Out-of-domain
ASR systems can be applied to perform speaker adaptation with untranscribed
training data of the target language, and to decode the training speech into
frame-level labels for DNN training. It is also found that better frame labels
can be generated by considering temporal dependency in speech when performing
frame clustering. The proposed methods of feature learning are evaluated on the
standard task of unsupervised subword modeling in Track 1 of the ZeroSpeech
2017 Challenge. The best performance achieved by our system is $9.7\%$ in terms
of across-speaker triphone minimal-pair ABX error rate, which is comparable to

closeness between target languages and out-of-domain languages and the amount
of available training data for individual target languages could have
significant impact on the goodness of learned features.

propose quantum plasmonic immunoassay sensing as an innovative scheme, which
embeds immunoassay sensing with recently demonstrated room temperature strong
coupling in nanoplasmonic cavities. In our protocol, the
antibody-antigen-antibody complex is chemically linked with a quantum emitter
label. Placing the quantum-emitter enhanced antibody-antigen-antibody complexes
inside or close to a nanoplasmonic (hemisphere dimer) cavity facilitates strong
coupling between the plasmon-polaritons and the emitter label resulting in
signature Rabi splitting. Through rigorous statistical analysis of multiple
analytes randomly distributed on the substrate in extensive realistic
computational experiments, we demonstrate a drastic enhancement of the
sensitivity up to nearly 1500% compared to conventional shifting-type plasmonic
sensors. Most importantly and in stark contrast to classical sensing, we
achieve in the strong-coupling (quantum) sensing regime an enhanced sensitivity
that is no longer dependent on the concentration of antibody-antigen-antibody
complexes -- down to the single-analyte limit. The quantum plasmonic
immunoassay scheme thus not only leads to the development of plasmonic
bio-sensing for single molecules but also opens up new pathways towards

adaptive scheme is exploited to modify the grid connectivity in a conservative
way, and the governing equations for compressible inviscid flows are solved
within the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian framework by including special
fictitious fluxes representing volume modifications due to mesh adaptation.The
absence of interpolation of the solution to the new grid prevents spurious
oscillations that may make the solution of the flow field in the NICFD regime
more difficult and less robust.Non-ideal gas effects are taken into account by
adopting the polytropic Peng-Robinson thermodynamic model. The numerical
results focus on the problem of a piston moving in a tube filled with siloxane

obscuring torus was so far held responsible for the observed mid-infrared (MIR)
emission of AGN. However, the best studied objects with VLTI/MIDI show that
instead a polar dusty wind is dominating these wavelengths, leaving little room
for a torus contribution. But is this wind an ubiquitous part of the AGN? To
test this, we conducted a straightforward detection experiment, using the
upgraded VLT/VISIR for deep subarcsecond resolution MIR imaging of a sample of
nine [O IV]-bright, obscured AGN, all of which were predicted to have
detectable polar emission. Indeed, the new data reveal such emission in all
objects but one. We further estimate lower limits on the extent of the polar
dust and show that the polar dust emission is dominating the total MIR emission
of the AGN. These findings support the scenario that polar dust is not only
ubiquitous in AGN but also an integral part of its structure, processing a
significant part of the primary radiation. The polar dust has to be optically
thin on average, which explains, e.g., the small dispersion in the observed
mid-infrared--X-ray luminosity correlation. At the same time, it has to be
taken into account when deriving covering factors of obscuring material from
mid-infrared to bolometric luminosity ratios. Finally, we find a new tentative
trend of increasing MIR emission size with increasing Eddington ratio.

where the spatio-temporal rate of events is a linear superposition of
background intensity and the aftershock clusters triggered by preceding
activity. Traditionally, statistical seismology has interpreted this model as
the outcome of an epidemic branching process, where one-to-one causal links can
be established between mainshocks and aftershocks. Declustering techniques have
been used to infer the underlying triggering trees and relate their topological
properties with epidemic branching models. Here, we review how the standard
Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model extends from the Galton-Watson
(GW) branching processes and bridges two extreme cases: Poisson sampling and
scale-free power-law trees. We report the most essential topological properties
expected in GW epidemic trees: the branching probability, the distribution of
tree size, the expected family size, and the relation between average
leaf-depth and tree size. We find that such topological properties depend
exclusively on two sampling parameters of the standard ETAS model: the average
branching ratio $N_b$ and the exponent ratio $\alpha/b$ determining the
branching probability distribution. From these results, one can use the
memory-less GW as a null-model for empirical triggering processes and assess
the validity of the ETAS model to reproduce the statistics of natural and
artificial catalogs.

only the channel's top wall deformation is considered, and the ratio between
its thickness $t$ and width $w$ is assumed to be $(t/w)^2 \gg 1$. We show that
the deformation at each stream-wise cross-section can be considered
independently, and that the top wall can be regarded as a simply supported
rectangle subject to uniform pressure at its bottom. The stress and
displacement fields are found using Fourier series, based on which the channel
shape and the hydrodynamic resistance are calculated, yielding a new flow
rate--pressure drop relation without fitting parameters. Our results agree
favorably with, and thus rationalize, previous experiments.

pole-on. From asymptotic period spacing we see many high-degree modes, up to

the out of time ordered four point function. In a large class of local systems,
the effects of chaos in this correlator build up exponentially fast inside the
so called butterfly cone. It has been previously observed that the growth of
these effects is organized along rays and can be characterized by a velocity
dependent Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda({\bf v})$. We show that this exponent is
bounded inside the butterfly cone as $\lambda({\bf v})\leq 2\pi T(1-|{\bf
v}|/v_B)$, where $T$ is the temperature and $v_B$ is the butterfly speed. This
result generalizes the chaos bound of Maldacena, Shenker and Stanford. We study
$\lambda({\bf v})$ in some examples such as two dimensional SYK models and
holographic gauge theories, and observe that in these systems the bound gets
saturated at some critical velocity $v_*<v_B$. In this sense, boosting a system
enhances chaos. We discuss the connection to conformal Regge theory, where
$\lambda({\bf v})$ is related to the spin of the leading large $N$ Regge
trajectory, and controls the four point function in an interpolating regime
between the Regge and the light cone limit. Finally, we comment on the
generalization of the chaos bound to boosted and rotating ensembles and clarify

complexity metrics provide actual lower bounds to the circuit complexity

out by our analysis. Such measures are shown to be unrelated to circuit
complexity in general and to produce severe violations of Lloyd's bound in
simple situations. Among the metrics which do provide lower bounds, the idea is
to select those which produce the tightest possible ones. This establishes a
hierarchy of cost functions and considerably reduces the list of candidate
complexity measures. In particular, the criterion suggests a canonical way of
dealing with penalties, consisting in assigning infinite costs to directions
not belonging to the gate set. We discuss how this can be implemented through
the use of Lagrange multipliers. We argue that one of the surviving cost
functions defines a particularly canonical notion in the sense that: i) it
straightforwardly follows from the standard Hermitian metric in Hilbert space;
ii) its associated complexity functional is closely related to Kirillov's
coadjoint orbit action, providing an explicit realization of the ``complexity

cat, binomial, and GKP codes have been implemented experimentally in circuit
QED and trapped ion systems. Moreover, there have been many theoretical
proposals to scale up such single-mode bosonic codes to realize large-scale
fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we consider the concatenation of the
single-mode GKP code with the surface code, namely, the surface-GKP code. In
particular, we thoroughly investigate the performance of the surface-GKP code
by assuming realistic GKP states with a finite squeezing and noisy circuit
elements due to photon losses. By using a minimum-weight perfect matching
decoding algorithm on a 3D space-time graph, we show that fault-tolerant
quantum error correction is possible with the surface-GKP code if the squeezing
of the GKP states is higher than 11.2dB in the case where the GKP states are
the only noisy elements. We also show that the squeezing threshold changes to
18:6dB when both the GKP states and circuit elements are comparably noisy. At
this threshold, each circuit component fails with probability 0.69%. Finally,
if the GKP states are noiseless, fault-tolerant quantum error correction with
the surface-GKP code is possible if each circuit element fails with probability
less than 0.81%. We stress that our decoding scheme uses the additional
information from GKP-stabilizer measurements and we provide a simple method to
compute renormalized edge weights of the matching graphs. Furthermore, our
noise model is general as it includes full circuit-level noise.

  Carlo Ferrigno","Probing clumpy wind accretion in IGR J18027-2016 with XMM-Newton","13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables; Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab3a40",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supergiant X-ray binaries usually comprise a neutron star accreting from the
wind of a OB supergiant companion. They are classified as classical systems and
the supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs). The different behavior of these
sub-classes of sources in X-rays, with SFXTs displaying much more pronounced
variability, is usually (at least) partly ascribed to different physical
properties of the massive star clumpy stellar wind. In case of SFXTs, a
systematic investigation of the effects of clumps on flares/outbursts of these
sources has been reported by Bozzo et al. (2017) exploiting the capabilities of
the instruments on-board XMM-Newton to perform a hardness-resolved spectral
analysis on timescales as short as a few hundreds of seconds. In this paper, we
use six XMM-Newton observations of IGR J18027-2016 to extend the above study to
a classical supergiant X-ray binary and compare the findings with those derived
in the case of SFXTs. As these observations of IGR J18027-2016 span different
orbital phases, we also study its X-ray spectral variability on longer
timescales and compare our results with previous publications. Although
obtaining measurements of the clump physical properties from X-ray observations
of accreting supergiant X-ray binaries was already proven to be challenging,
our study shows that similar imprints of clumps are found in the X-ray
observations of the supergiant fast X-ray transients and at least one classical
system, i.e. IGR J18027-2016. This provides interesting perspectives to further
extend this study to many XMM-Newton observations already performed in the
direction of other classical supergiant X-ray binaries.

  Swanson","An Empirical Guide to the Behavior and Use of Scalable Persistent Memory",,,,,"cs.DC cs.PF","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  After nearly a decade of anticipation, scalable nonvolatile memory DIMMs are
finally commercially available with the release of Intel's 3D XPoint DIMM. This
new nonvolatile DIMM supports byte-granularity accesses with access times on
the order of DRAM, while also providing data storage that survives power
outages. Researchers have not idly waited for real nonvolatile DIMMs (NVDIMMs)
to arrive. Over the past decade, they have written a slew of papers proposing
new programming models, file systems, libraries, and applications built to
exploit the performance and flexibility that NVDIMMs promised to deliver. Those
papers drew conclusions and made design decisions without detailed knowledge of
how real NVDIMMs would behave or how industry would integrate them into
computer architectures. Now that 3D XPoint NVDIMMs are actually here, we can
provide detailed performance numbers, concrete guidance for programmers on
these systems, reevaluate prior art for performance, and reoptimize persistent
memory software for the real 3D XPoint DIMM. In this paper, we explore the
performance properties and characteristics of Intel's new 3D XPoint DIMM at the
micro and macro level. First, we investigate the basic characteristics of the
device, taking special note of the particular ways in which its performance is
peculiar relative to traditional DRAM or other past methods used to emulate
NVM. From these observations, we recommend a set of best practices to maximize
the performance of the device. With our improved understanding, we then explore
the performance of prior art in application-level software for persistent
memory, taking note of where their performance was influenced by our
guidelines.

associated with core-collapse supernovae observed within a source distance of
approximately 20 Mpc during the first and second observing runs of Advanced
LIGO and Advanced Virgo. No significant gravitational-wave candidate was
detected. We report the detection efficiencies as a function of the distance
for waveforms derived from multidimensional numerical simulations and
phenomenological extreme emission models. For neutrino-driven explosions the
distance at which we reach 50% detection efficiency is approaching 5 kpc, and
for magnetorotationally-driven explosions is up to 54 kpc. However, waveforms
for extreme emission models are detectable up to 28 Mpc. For the first time,
the gravitational-wave data enabled us to exclude part of the parameter spaces
of two extreme emission models with confidence up to 83%, limited by coincident
data coverage. Besides, using ad hoc harmonic signals windowed with Gaussian
envelopes we constrained the gravitational-wave energy emitted during
core-collapse at the levels of $4.27\times 10^{-4}\,M_\odot c^2$ and
$1.28\times 10^{-1}\,M_\odot c^2$ for emissions at 235 Hz and 1304 Hz
respectively. These constraints are two orders of magnitude more stringent than
previously derived in the corresponding analysis using initial LIGO, initial
Virgo and GEO 600 data.

low-latency searches for compact binaries make simplifying assumptions that
could introduce biases in the mass parameters: neutron stars are treated as
point particles with dimensionless spins below $0.05$ and perfectly aligned
with the orbital angular momentum. Furthermore, the template bank used to
search for them has a finite resolution. In this paper we show that none of
these limitations can introduce chirp mass biases larger than $\sim

a variety of red-optical and near-infrared detectors, and compare the scatter

recommend the use of a low-dark-current detector with H-band NIR photometric
capabilities. We then investigate the potential for performing a survey for
Earth-sized planets for a variety of telescope sizes. We simulate planetary
systems around a set of spectroscopically confirmed L and T dwarfs using
measured M dwarf planet occurrence rates from $\textit{Kepler}$, and simulate
their observation in surveys ranging in duration from 120 to 600 nights,
randomly discarding 30% of nights to simulate weather losses. We find that an
efficient survey design uses a 2-meter-class telescope with a NIR instrument
and 360-480 observing nights, observing multiple L and T targets each night
with a dithering strategy. Surveys conducted in such a manner have over an 80%
chance of detecting at least one planet, and detect around 2 planets, on

occurrence rate, however, which may in fact be higher for L and T dwarfs than

  Classification","Major revision; Change of authors due to contributions",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The dynamic ensemble selection of classifiers is an effective approach for
processing label-imbalanced data classifications. However, such a technique is
prone to overfitting, owing to the lack of regularization methods and the
dependence of the aforementioned technique on local geometry. In this study,
focusing on binary imbalanced data classification, a novel dynamic ensemble
method, namely adaptive ensemble of classifiers with regularization (AER), is
proposed, to overcome the stated limitations. The method solves the overfitting
problem through implicit regularization. Specifically, it leverages the
properties of stochastic gradient descent to obtain the solution with the
minimum norm, thereby achieving regularization; furthermore, it interpolates
the ensemble weights by exploiting the global geometry of data to further
prevent overfitting. According to our theoretical proofs, the seemingly
complicated AER paradigm, in addition to its regularization capabilities, can
actually reduce the asymptotic time and memory complexities of several other
algorithms. We evaluate the proposed AER method on seven benchmark imbalanced
datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and one artificially
generated GMM-based dataset with five variations. The results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms the major existing algorithms based on multiple
metrics in most cases, and two hypothesis tests (McNemar's and Wilcoxon tests)
verify the statistical significance further. In addition, the proposed method
has other preferred properties such as special advantages in dealing with
highly imbalanced data, and it pioneers the research on the regularization for
dynamic ensemble methods.

curvature (C) perturbations, i.e., CPBHs, constraints on PBH abundance provide
in principle constraints on the primordial curvature power spectrum. This
connection however depends necessarily on the details of PBH formation
mechanism. In this paper we provide, for the first time, constraints on the
primordial curvature power spectrum from the latest limits on PBH abundance,
taking into account all the steps from gravitational collapse in real space to
PBH formation. In particular, we use results from numerical relativity
simulations and peak theory to study the conditions for PBH formation for a
range of perturbation shapes, including non-linearities, perturbation profile
and a careful treatment of smoothing and filtering scales. We then obtain
updated PBH formation conditions and translate that into primordial spectrum
constraints for a wide range of shapes and abundances. These updated
constraints cover a range of scales not probed by other cosmological
observables. Our results show that the correct and accurate modelling of
non-linearities, filtering and typical perturbation profile, is crucial for
deriving meaningful cosmological implications.

in living cells. It involves multiple protein molecules that locate specific
sites on DNA and assemble gene initiation or gene repression multi-molecular
complexes. While the protein search dynamics for DNA targets has been
intensively investigated, the role of inter-molecular interactions during the
genetic activation or repression remains not well quantified. Here we present a
simple one-dimensional model of target search for two interacting molecules
that can reversibly form a dimer molecular complex, which also participates in
the search process. In addition, the proteins have finite residence times on
specific target sites, and the gene is activated or repressed when both
proteins are simultaneously present at the target. The model is analyzed using
first-passage analytical calculations and Monte Carlo computer simulations. It
is shown that the search dynamics exhibits a complex behavior depending on the
strength of inter-molecular interactions and on the target residence times. We
also found that the search time shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of
the dissociation rate for the molecular complex. Physical-chemical arguments to
explain these observations are presented. Our theoretical approach highlights
the importance of molecular interactions in the complex process of gene
activation/repression by multiple transcription factor proteins.

of microbial life including sensing and navigating the environment. In order to
propel a swimming microorganism they displace the surrounding fluid by means of
periodic motions, while precisely-timed modulations of their beating patterns
enable the cell to steer towards or away from specific locations.
Characterizing the dynamic forces, however, is challenging and typically relies
on indirect experimental approaches. Here, we present direct in vivo
measurements of the dynamic forces of motile Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells in
controlled environments. The experiments are based on partially aspirating a
living microorganism at the tip of a micropipette force sensor and optically
recording the micropipette's position fluctuations with high temporal and
sub-pixel spatial resolution. We provide an analytic elasto-hydrodynamic model
for the micropipette force sensor and describe how to obtain the micropipette's
full frequency response function from a dynamic force calibration. Using this
approach, we find dynamic forces during the free swimming activity of
individual Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells of 23$\pm$5 pN resulting from the
coordinated flagellar beating with a frequency of 51$\pm$6 Hz. In addition to
measurements in bulk liquid environment, we study the dynamic forces of the
biflagellated microswimmer in the vicinity of a solid/liquid interface. As we
gradually decrease the distance of the swimming microbe to the interface, we
measure a significantly enhanced force transduction at distances larger than
the maximum extend of the beating flagella, highlighting the importance of
hydrodynamic interactions for scenarios in which flagellated microorganisms
encounter surfaces.

introduce uniaxial single-ion anisotropy and Heisenberg exchange anisotropy
between interacted nickel atoms. We then examine effects of both anisotropy
parameters on the magnetization process, as well as on the specific heat of the
model. We predict intermediate magnetization plateaus, including zero plateau,
and magnetization jumps with magnetic ground-state phase transitions at low
temperature $T=1$K. The magnetization plateaus are strongly dependent on both
the levels of exchange anisotropy and single-ion anisotropy. Varying the former
leads to change in width and magnetic position of all intermediate plateaus
while they become wider upon increasing the latter. The specific heat of the
model manifests a Schottky-type maximum at moderate temperature in the presence
of weak magnetic fields, when the system is isotropic. The introducion of
aniostropy results in substantial variations in the thermal behavior of the
specific heat. Indeed, by tuning anisotropy parameters the Schottky peak
convert to a double-peak temperature dependence that coincided with the

coherent structure of a tropical cyclone (TC) continues to improve with the
availability of more detailed observations and high-resolution model outputs.
However, a precise understanding of how these asymmetries impact TC intensity
changes is lacking. Prior attempts at investigating the asymmetric impacts
follow a mean-eddy partitioning that condenses the effect of all the
asymmetries into one term and fails to highlight the differences in the role of
asymmetries at different scales. In this study, we present a novel
energetics-based approach to analyze the asymmetric impacts at multiple
length-scales during periods of TC rapid intensity changes. Using model outputs
of TCs under low and high shear, we compute the different energy pathways that
enhance/suppress the growth of multi-scale asymmetries in the wavenumber (WN)
domain. We then compare and contrast the energetics of the mean flow field (WN
0) with that of the persistent, coherent vortex-scale asymmetric structures
(WNs 1,2) and the more local, transient, sub-vortex-scale asymmetries (WNs
$\geq$ 3). We find in our case-studies that the dominant mechanisms of
growth/decay of the asymmetries are the baroclinic conversion from available
potential to kinetic energy at individual scales of asymmetries, and the
transactions of kinetic energy between the asymmetries of various
length-scales; rather than the barotropic mean-eddy transactions as is
typically assumed. Our case-study analysis further shows that the growth/decay
of asymmetries is largely independent of the mean. Certain aspects of eddy
energetics can potentially serve as early-warning indicators of TC rapid
intensity changes.

reduced-order models (ROMs) from high-fidelity simulations, and illustrates it
in the challenging context of a single-injector combustion process. The method
combines the perspectives of model reduction and machine learning. Model
reduction brings in the physics of the problem, constraining the ROM
predictions to lie on a subspace defined by the governing equations. This is
achieved by defining the ROM in proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
coordinates, which embed the rich physics information contained in solution
snapshots of a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The
machine learning perspective brings the flexibility to use transformed physical
variables to define the POD basis. This is in contrast to traditional model
reduction approaches that are constrained to use the physical variables of the
high-fidelity code. Combining the two perspectives, the approach identifies a
set of transformed physical variables that expose quadratic structure in the
combustion governing equations and learns a quadratic ROM from transformed
snapshot data. This learning does not require access to the high-fidelity model
implementation. Numerical experiments show that the ROM accurately predicts
temperature, pressure, velocity, species concentrations, and the limit-cycle
amplitude, with speedups of more than five orders of magnitude over
high-fidelity models. Our ROM simulation is shown to be predictive 200% past
the training interval. Moreover, ROM-predicted pressure traces accurately match
the phase of the pressure signal and yield good approximations of the
limit-cycle amplitude.

only a single layer of metasurface that corrects third-order Seidel aberrations
including coma, astigmatism, and field curvature. The metalens further features
a planar focal plane, which enables considerably simplified system
architectures for applications in imaging and projection. We fabricated the
metalens using Huygens meta-atoms operating at 5.2 micron wavelength and
experimentally demonstrated aberration-free focusing and imaging over the

be alleviated by training a neural network to directly predict a suitable shape

anisotropic voxel sizes often found in fluorescence microscopy datasets, and 3)
efficiently computing intersections between pairs of star-convex polyhedra

the secret key rate highly depends on the coherence time of the channel. In
particular, a straightforward method of generating secret keys in static

introduce a low-complexity method called induced randomness. In this method,
Alice and Bob independently generate local randomness to be used together with
the uniqueness of the wireless channel coefficients in order to enable
high-rate secret key generation. In this work, two scenarios are considered:
first, when Alice and Bob share a direct communication channel, and second,
when Alice and Bob do not have a direct link and communicate through an
untrusted relay. After exchanging the induced randomness, post-processing is
done by Alice and Bob to generate highly-correlated samples that are used for
the key generation. Such samples are then converted into bits, disparities
between the sequences generated by Alice and Bob are mitigated, and the
resulting sequences are then hashed to compensate for the information leakage
to the eavesdropper and to allow consistency checking of the generated key bit
sequences. We utilize semantic security measures and information-theoretic
inequalities to upper bound the probability of successful eavesdropping attack
in terms of the mutual information measures that can be numerically computed.
Given certain reasonable system parameters this bound is numerically evaluated
to be $2^{-31}$ and $2^{-10.57}$ in the first and the second scenario,

convergence towards weak solutions. In order to construct the numerical scheme,
we use a splitting technique to deal with the chemo-attraction term in the

consider a fully discrete Finite Element approximation which is well-posed and
it is mass-conservative. We obtain uniform estimates and analyze the

range of malicious attempts to trick individuals into performing undesired
actions, often to the benefit of the adversary. The most popular medium of
these attempts is phishing attacks, particularly through emails and websites.
In order to defend against such attacks, there is an urgent need for automated
mechanisms to identify this malevolent content before it reaches users. Machine
learning techniques have gradually become the standard for such classification
problems. However, identifying common measurable features of phishing content
(e.g., in emails) is notoriously difficult. To address this problem, we engage
in a novel study into a phishing content classifier based on a recurrent neural
network (RNN), which identifies such features without human input. At this
stage, we scope our research to emails, but our approach can be extended to
apply to websites. Our results show that the proposed system outperforms
state-of-the-art tools. Furthermore, our classifier is efficient and takes into
account only the text and, in particular, the textual structure of the email.
Since these features are rarely considered in email classification, we argue
that our classifier can complement existing classifiers with high information
gain.

Weyl semimetal (WSM) heterostructure by employing a periodic three-dimensional
topoelectrical (TE) circuit network. By drawing the analogy between
inductor-capacitor circuit lattices and quantum mechanical tight-binding (TB)
models, we show that the energy flux in a TE network is analogous to the
probability flux in a TB Hamiltonian. TE systems offer a key advantage in that
they can be easily tuned to achieve different topological WSM phases simply by
varying the capacitances and inductances. The above analogy opens the way to
the study of tunneling across heterojunctions separating different types of
WSMs in TE circuits, a situation which is virtually impossible to realize in
physical WSM materials. We show that the energy flux transmission in a WSM
heterostructure depends highly on the relative orientation of the transport
direction and the $k$-space tilt direction. For the transmission from a Type I
WSM source lead to a Type II WSM drain lead, all valleys transmit equally when
the tilt and transmission directions are perpendicular to each other. In
contrast, large inter-valley scattering is required for transmission when the
tilt and transport directions are parallel to each other, leading to
valley-dependent transmission. We describe a Type III WSM phase intermediate
between the Type I and Type II phases. An `anti-Klein' tunneling occurs between
a Type I source and Type III drain where the transmission is totally suppressed
for some valleys at normal incidence. This is in direct contrast to the usual
Klein tunneling in Dirac materials where normally incident flux is perfectly
transmitted. Owing to the ease of fabrication and experimental accessibility,
TE circuits offer an excellent testbed to study the extraordinary transport
phenomena in WSM based heterostructures.

Recently a dataset about question answering involving qualitative relationships

explored, in the heart of which lies a semantic parser that converts the

semantic parsers is that they try to directly convert the input sentences to a

the semantic parser to learn almost everything from scratch. In this paper, we
show that instead of using a semantic parser to produce the logical form, if we
apply the generate-validate framework i.e. generate a natural language

state of ultrathin MX$ _2$ compounds and, in particular, the origin of
anisotropic (stripe and quasi-stripe) CDW phases is a long-standing problem.
Anisotropic CDW phases have been explained by Coulomb interaction between
domain walls and inter-layer interaction. However, these models assume that
anisotropic domain walls can exist in the first place. Here, we report that
anisotropic CDW domain walls can appear naturally without assuming anisotropic
interactions: We explain the origin of these phases by topological defect
theory (line defects in a two-dimensional plane) and interference between
harmonics of macroscopic CDW wave functions. We revisit the
McMillan-Nakanishi-Shiba model for monolayer 1$T$-TaS$ _2$ and 2$H$-TaSe$ _2$
and show that CDWs with wave vectors that are separated by $120^\circ$ (i.e.
the three-fold rotation symmetry of the underlying lattice) contain a
free-energy landscape with many local minima. Then, we remove this $120^\circ$
constraint and show that free energy local minima corresponding to the stripe
and quasi-stripe phase appear. Our results imply that Coulomb interaction
between domain walls and inter-layer interaction may be secondary factors for
the appearance of these phases. Furthermore, this model can predict new CDW
phases, hence it may become the basis to study CDW further. We anticipate our
results to be a starting point for further study in two-dimensional physics,

characteristic mid-infrared (mIR) peak rapidly develops in $\sigma(\omega)$,
and its peak energy and width increase with pressure. These features are

concerns for many organizations (users) with sensitive data to utilize
cloud-based solutions. User-side encryption can potentially address these
concerns by establishing user-centric cloud services and granting data control
to the user. Nonetheless, user-side encryption limits the ability to process
(e.g., search) encrypted data on the cloud. Accordingly, in this research, we
provide a framework that enables processing (in particular, searching) of
encrypted multi-organizational (i.e., multi-source) big data without revealing
the data to cloud provider. Our framework leverages locality feature of edge
computing to offer a user-centric search ability in a real-time manner. In
particular, the edge system intelligently predicts the user's search pattern
and prunes the multi-source big data search space to reduce the search time.
The pruning system is based on efficient sampling from the clustered big
dataset on the cloud. For each cluster, the pruning system dynamically samples
appropriate number of terms based on the user's search tendency, so that the
cluster is optimally represented. We developed a prototype of a user-centric

However, their limited driving range fosters the occurrence of charging
requests deriving from EV drivers in urban road networks, which have
significant uncertain characteristic from time dimension in the real-world
situation. To tackle the challenge brought by the dynamic charging requests,
this study is devoted to proposing optimal strategies to provide guidance for
EV charging. The time-varying characteristic of road network is further
involved in the problem formulation. Based on the charging request information,
we propose two charging guidance strategies from different perspectives. One of
the strategies considers the travel demands of EV drivers and uses the driving
distance as the optimization criterion. In contrast, the other strategy focuses
on the impacts of EV number on the charging station operation and service
satisfaction. The reachable charging stations with minimum vehicle number are
selected as the optimal ones. More importantly, both the strategies have the
ability to ensure the reachability of selected charging stations in a
time-varying road network. In addition, we conduct simulation examples to
investigate the performance of the proposed charging guidance strategies.
Besides, the insights and recommendations on application scenarios of the
strategies are introduced according to the simulation results under various

B0031-07's three drift modes (A, B, and C) can be understood in terms of a
single carousel rotation rate if the number of sparks is allowed to change by
an integral number, and where the different drift rates are due to
(first-order) aliasing effects. This also results in harmonically-related
values for P 3 (the time it takes a subpulse to reappear at the same pulse
phase), which we confirm for B0031-07. A representative solution has [n_A, n_B,
n_C] = [15, 14, 13] sparks and a carousel rotation period of P_4 = 16.4 P_1. We
also investigate the frequency dependence of B0031-07's subpulse behaviour. We
extend the carousel model to include the dual effects of aberration and
retardation, including the time it takes the information about the surface
spark configuration to travel from the surface up to the emission point.
Assuming these effects dominate at B0031-07's emission heights, we derive
conservative emission height differences of $\lesssim 2000$ km for mode A and
$\lesssim 1000$ km for modes B and C as seen between 185 MHz and 610 MHz. This
new method of measuring emission heights is independent of others that involve

provides a potentially strong test of the carousel model.

formulate the optimization problem that maximizes the CI effect subject to the
requirement of the 1-bit transmit signals. We then mathematically prove that,
when employing the CI formulation and relaxing the 1-bit constraint, the
majority of the transmit signals already satisfy the 1-bit formulation.
Building upon this important observation, we propose a 1-bit precoding approach
that further improves the performance of the conventional 1-bit CI precoding
via a partial branch-and-bound (P-BB) process, where the BB procedure is
performed only for the entries that do not comply with the 1-bit requirement.
This operation allows a significant complexity reduction compared to the
fully-BB (F-BB) process, and enables the BB framework to be applicable to the
complex massive MIMO scenarios. We further develop an alternative 1-bit scheme
through an `Ordered Partial Sequential Update' (OPSU) process that allows an
additional complexity reduction. Numerical results show that both proposed

studied in the context of modified teleparallel theories of gravity. We focus
the analysis on eleven dimensional spacetimes, where the seven dimensional
extra dimensions are compactified. In particular, and due to the importance
that global vector fields play within the conceptual body of teleparallel
modified gravity models, we consider the additional dimensions to be products
of parallelizable spheres. The global vector fields characterizing the
different topologies are obtained, as well as the equations of motion
associated to them. Using global dynamical system techniques, we discuss some
physical consequences arising because of the existence of the extra dimensions.
In particular, the possibility of having an early inflationary epoch driven by
the presence of extra dimensions without other matter sources is discussed.

deep neural networks, and the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is one of the most
widely used activation functions. Various new activation functions and
improvements on ReLU have been proposed, but each carry performance drawbacks.
In this paper, we propose an improved activation function, which we name the

the parametric natural logarithmic transform to improve ReLU and is simply
defined as. NLReLU not only retains the sparse activation characteristic of
ReLU, but it also alleviates the ""dying ReLU"" and vanishing gradient problems
to some extent. It also reduces the bias shift effect and heteroscedasticity of
neuron data distributions among network layers in order to accelerate the
learning process. The proposed method was verified across ten convolutional
neural networks with different depths for two essential datasets. Experiments
illustrate that convolutional neural networks with NLReLU exhibit higher
accuracy than those with ReLU, and that NLReLU is comparable to other
well-known activation functions. NLReLU provides 0.16% and 2.04% higher
classification accuracy on average compared to ReLU when used in shallow
convolutional neural networks with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets,

the nodes are naturally connected via waveguides, it is challenging to fulfill
this need because stringent conditions such as spatial mode-matching
configuration and time-reversal symmetry have to be satisfied. Here we report a
type of quantum photonic nodes consisting of single quantum emitters and
cascaded microring resonators for on-chip state transfer. By interfacing the
node with a waveguide, we show that all the emission from the node can be
funneled into the waveguide and its temporal profile can be synthesized to be
time-reversal symmetric. We demonstrate theoretically on-chip quantum state

usually the center of the head. And the task is to estimate the total count in
a crowd scene. Most of the state-of-the-art methods are based on density map
estimation, which convert the sparse point annotations into a ""ground truth""
density map through a Gaussian kernel, and then use it as the learning target
to train a density map estimator. However, such a ""ground-truth"" density map is
imperfect due to occlusions, perspective effects, variations in object shapes,
etc. On the contrary, we propose \emph{Bayesian loss}, a novel loss function
which constructs a density contribution probability model from the point
annotations. Instead of constraining the value at every pixel in the density
map, the proposed training loss adopts a more reliable supervision on the count
expectation at each annotated point. Without bells and whistles, the loss
function makes substantial improvements over the baseline loss on all tested
datasets. Moreover, our proposed loss function equipped with a standard

traditionally believed to be mediated only by B and T lymphocytes that
recognize antigen epitopes in a receptor-restricted manner. During the last
decade data accumulated to show that monocytes and macrophages, the two main
initiators of innate immune response, also built up a ""memory"" to antigens they
encountered, though in most concerned publications a different wording (i.e.
""train"" or""educate"") was utilized to describe this feature. More recently, Hole
et al demonstrated a ""memory-like"" response of dendritic cells (DCs). In brief,
if fungal-challenged mice could develop a protective immune response, DCs
immediately (in 3 weeks) isolated from those mice would manifest a
pro-inflammatory phenotype. Even after the mice were allowed to rest for 10
weeks, DCs from them still exhibited an enhanced immune activation profile in
their transcriptome and cytokine productions upon re-challenge with same
pathogens. Lastly, Hole showed that the ""training"" or memory-building in DCs
was achieved by histone modification. All above findings obtained in monocytes,
macrophages or DCs emphasized the necessity for rechecking the questions
whether antigen presenting cells (APCs) as a whole could be classified the
third class of cells that would mediate immunological memory. In this essay,
the author described the effort he made in late 1990s to identify dendtitic
cell-mediated memory, and how he named his daughter SHUYI to memorize that
hypothesis.

needed to be estimated using various machine learning algorithms or
mathematical methods such as approximations and interpolations. In this paper,
we propose an adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation algorithm for
estimating missing values in geographical data. In the proposed method, the
samples with known values are considered as the data points, while the samples
with missing values are considered as the interpolated points. For each
interpolated point, first, a local set of data points are adaptively
determined. Then, the missing value of the interpolated point is imputed via
interpolating using the RBF interpolation based on the local set of data
points. Moreover, the shape factors of the RBF are also adaptively determined
by considering the distribution of the local set of data points. To evaluate
the performance of the proposed method, we compare our method with the commonly
used k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) interpolation and Adaptive Inverse Distance
Weighted (AIDW) methods, and conduct three groups of benchmark experiments.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the kNN
interpolation and AIDW in terms of accuracy, but worse than the kNN
interpolation and AIDW in terms of efficiency.

massive test particle with zero angular momentum have a global minimum. A SFNS
has a static degenerated orbit on which a test particle, having zero angular
momentum and the minimum of its energy, remains at rest at all times. This
implies that there exists a spherical shell consisting of cold gas or dust,
which for a distant observer can look like the shadow of a black hole. We also
study the shape of noncircular bound orbits close to the centres of SFNSs and
show that their angles of precession are negative.

visual object tracking using correlation filters often has to confront
undesired boundary effect. As boundary effect severely degrade the quality of
object model, it has made it a challenging task for unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) to perform robust and accurate object following. Traditional hand-crafted
features are also not precise and robust enough to describe the object in the
viewing point of UAV. In this work, a novel tracker with online enhanced
background learning is specifically proposed to tackle boundary effects. Real
background samples are densely extracted to learn as well as update correlation
filters. Spatial penalization is introduced to offset the noise introduced by
exceedingly more background information so that a more accurate appearance
model can be established. Meanwhile, convolutional features are extracted to
provide a more comprehensive representation of the object. In order to mitigate
changes of objects' appearances, multi-frame technique is applied to learn an
ideal response map and verify the generated one in each frame. Exhaustive
experiments were conducted on 100 challenging UAV image sequences and the

of: machine learning of the relation between the hole pattern and the
corresponding Q factor, and new dataset generation based on the regression
function obtained by machine learning. First a dataset comprising randomly
generated cavity structures and their first principles Q factors is prepared.
Then a deep neural network is trained using the initial dataset to obtain a
regression function that approximately predicts the Q factors from the
structural parameters. Several candidates for higher Q factors are chosen by
searching the parameter space using the regression function. After adding these
new structures and their first principles Q factors to the training dataset,
the above process is repeated. As an example, a standard silicon-based L3
cavity is optimized by this method. A cavity design with a high Q factor
exceeding 11 million is found within 101 iteration steps and a total of 8070
cavity structures. This theoretical Q factor is more than twice of the
previously reported record values of the cavity designs detected by the
evolutionary algorithm and the leaky mode visualization method. It is found
that structures with higher Q factors can be detected within less iteration

study, we performed a canonical quantization of the Proca model to describe a
massive vector particle that shares common properties with the massive

Lagrangian, which describes the symmetric rank-two tensor, obtained by Siegel
and Zwiebach (SZ) from string field theory, we deduced that the Lagrangian
possesses only first class constraints that generate local gauge
transformation. By explicit calculations, we show that the massive symmetric
rank-two tensor theory is gauge invariant only in the critical dimension of
open bosonic string theory, i.e., $d=26$. This emphasizes that the origin of
local symmetry is the nilpotency of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)
operator, which is valid only in the critical dimension. For a particular gauge
imposed on the Stueckelberg fields, the gauge-invariant Lagrangian of the SZ
model reduces to the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian of a massive spin-two particle.
Thus, the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian is a gauge-fixed version of the
gauge-invariant Lagrangian for a massive symmetric rank-two tensor. By noting
that the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian is not suitable for studying massive spin-two
particles with small masses, we propose the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge to
quantize the SZ model as an alternative gauge condition. In the TT gauge, the
two Stueckelberg fields can be decoupled from the symmetric rank-two tensor and
integrated trivially. The massive spin-two particle can be described by the SZ
model in the TT gauge, where the propagator of the massive spin-two particle
has a well-defined massless limit.

spatial loss to update the model in an end-to-end fashion. By taking advantage

Intuitively, it is widely believed that location privacy can be preserved by

some time. However, a recent attack shows that these aggregated mobility data
can be exploited to recover individual trajectories. In this paper, we first
propose two differentially private basic schemes for aggregated mobility data

preserve location privacy of users and especially resist the trajectory
recovery attack. Then, we explore the moving characteristics of mobile users,
and design an improved scheme named static hybrid perturbation by combining the
two basic schemes according to the moving characteristics. Since static hybrid
perturbation works only for static data, which are entirely available before
publishing, we further adapt the static hybrid perturbation by combining it
with linear regression, and yield another improved scheme named dynamic hybrid
perturbation. The dynamic hybrid perturbation works also for dynamic data,
which are generated on the fly during publication. Privacy analysis shows that
the proposed schemes achieve differential privacy. Extensive experiments on

tensor-pseudotensor (T-PT) electron-nucleus (e-N) interactions between the
relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory and other many-body methods, we
employ the relativistic normal coupled-cluster (RNCC) theory to explain the
discrepancies. The normalization of the wave function in the RNCC theory
becomes unity by construction. This feature removes the ambiguity associated
with the uncertainties in calculations that could arise due to mismatch in
cancellation of the normalization factor of the wave function in a truncated
RCC method. Moreover, all the terms in the expression for EDM using the RNCC
method naturally terminate, in contrast to the RCC approach. By taking an
average of the results from two variants each of both the RCC and RNCC methods,
we recommend enhancement factors to the EDM of 225Ra due to NSM as $-$6.29(1)
$\times 10^{-17} |e| $cm $( |e| fm^3)$ and due to T-PT e-N coupling constant as
$-$12.66(14) $\times {10^{-20} \langle \sigma_N \rangle | e | }$cm, for the
nuclear Pauli spinor, $\sigma_N$. This is corroborated by analyzing the dipole
polarizability ($\alpha_d$) value of $^{225}$Ra, which is obtained as 244(13)

as compression stiffening, or an increase in moduli with increasing uniaxial
compressive strain. Does such a phenomenon exist in single cells, which are the
building blocks of tissues? One expects an individual cell to compression
soften since the semiflexible biopolymer-based cytoskeletal network maintains
the mechanical integrity of the cell and in vitro semiflexible biopolymer
networks typically compression soften. To the contrary, we find that mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) compression stiffen under uniaxial compression via
atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies. To understand this finding, we uncover
several potential mechanisms for compression stiffening. First, we study a
single semiflexible polymer loop modeling the actomyosin cortex enclosing a
viscous medium modeled as an incompressible fluid. Second, we study a
two-dimensional semiflexible polymer/fiber network interspersed with
area-conserving loops, which are a proxy for vesicles and fluid-based
organelles. Third, we study two-dimensional fiber networks with
angular-constraining crosslinks, i.e. semiflexible loops on the mesh scale. In
the latter two cases, the loops act as geometric constraints on the fiber
network to help stiffen it via increased angular interactions. We find that the
single semiflexible polymer loop model agrees well with our AFM experiments
until approximately 35% compressive strain. We also find for the fiber network
with area-conserving loops model that the stress-strain curves are sensitive to
the packing fraction and size distribution of the area-conserving loops,
thereby creating a mechanical fingerprint across different cell types. Finally,
we make comparisons between this model and experiments on fibrin networks
interlaced with beads as well as discuss the tissue-scale implications of
cellular compression stiffening.

the real player and fictitious player looking for time-consistent policy and
precomitted optimal policy, respectively. Namely, the fictitious-game framework
is actually an auxiliary-variable-based mechanism where the fictitious player
is our particular design. Noting that the real player's cost functional is
revised in accordance with that of fictitious player, the equilibrium policy of
real player is called an open-loop self-coordination control of original
linear-quadratic problem. As a generalization, a time-inconsistent nonzero-sum
stochastic linear-quadratic dynamic game is investigated, where one player is
to look for precommitted optimal policy and the other player is to search
time-consistent policy. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented to
ensure the existence of open-loop equilibrium of the nonzero-sum game, which
resort to a set of Riccati-like equations and linear equations. By applying the
developed theory of nonzero-sum game, open-loop self-coordination control of
the linear-quadratic optimal control is fully characterized, and multi-period
mean-variance portfolio selection is also investigated. Finally, numerical

and quantitively evaluate the acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesions, many
deep-learning-based lesion segmentation methods have been proposed in the
literature, where a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on
hundreds of fully labeled subjects with accurate annotations of AIS lesions.
Despite that high segmentation accuracy can be achieved, the accurate labels
should be annotated by experienced clinicians, and it is therefore very
time-consuming to obtain a large number of fully labeled subjects. In this
paper, we propose a semi-supervised method to automatically segment AIS lesions
in diffusion weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps. By using
a large number of weakly labeled subjects and a small number of fully labeled
subjects, our proposed method is able to accurately detect and segment the AIS
lesions. In particular, our proposed method consists of three parts: 1) a
double-path classification net (DPC-Net) trained in a weakly-supervised way is
used to detect the suspicious regions of AIS lesions; 2) a pixel-level K-Means
clustering algorithm is used to identify the hyperintensive regions on the
DWIs; and 3) a region-growing algorithm combines the outputs of the DPC-Net and
the K-Means to obtain the final precise lesion segmentation. In our experiment,
we use 460 weakly labeled subjects and 15 fully labeled subjects to train and
fine-tune the proposed method. By evaluating on a clinical dataset with 150
fully labeled subjects, our proposed method achieves a mean dice coefficient of
0.642, and a lesion-wise F1 score of 0.822.

representations between different data modalities. Unfortunately, little
research focuses on cross-modal correlation learning where temporal structures
of different data modalities, such as audio and video, should be taken into
account. Music video retrieval by given musical audio is a natural way to
search and interact with music contents. In this work, we study cross-modal
music video retrieval in terms of emotion similarity. Particularly, audio of an
arbitrary length is used to retrieve a longer or full-length music video. To
this end, we propose a novel audio-visual embedding algorithm by Supervised
Deep CanonicalCorrelation Analysis (S-DCCA) that projects audio and video into
a shared space to bridge the semantic gap between audio and video. This also
preserves the similarity between audio and visual contents from different
videos with the same class label and the temporal structure. The contribution
of our approach is mainly manifested in the two aspects: i) We propose to
select top k audio chunks by attention-based Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM)model, which can represent good audio summarization with local
properties. ii) We propose an end-to-end deep model for cross-modal
audio-visual learning where S-DCCA is trained to learn the semantic correlation
between audio and visual modalities. Due to the lack of music video dataset, we
construct 10K music video dataset from YouTube 8M dataset. Some promising
results such as MAP and precision-recall show that our proposed model can be

to their strongly varying masses contrasting physical behaviors making them
important geochemical tracers. When partial melting occurs at depth, the
partitioning of NGs between phases is controlled by a distribution coefficient
that can be determined from the solubility of the NGs in each phase. Here we
report quantitative calculations of the solubility of He, Ne, Ar and Xe in
carbonate melts based on molecular dynamics simulations. The NG solubilities
are first calculated in K2CO3-CaCO3 mixtures at 1 bar and favorably compared to
the only experimental data available to date. Then we investigate the effect of
pressure (up to 6 GPa), focusing on two melt compositions: a dolomitic one and
a natrocarbonatitic one (modeling the lava of Ol Doinyo Lengai). The solubility
decreases with the amount of alkaline-earth cation in the melt and with the
size of the noble gas. In the natrocarbonatitic melt, Henry's law is fulfilled
at low pressures (up to ~ 0.1 GPa). At higher pressures the solubility levels
off or even starts to diminish smoothly. In contrast, in molten dolomite the
effect of pressure is negligible on the studied P range (3-6 GPa). At the
pressures of the Earth's mantle, the solubilities of noble gases in carbonate
melts are still of the same order of magnitude as the ones in molten silicates
(~ 1-10 mol%). This suggests that carbonatitic melts at depth are not
preferential carriers of noble gases, even if the dependence with the melt
composition is not negligible and has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
Finally we evaluate the surface tension at the interface between carbonate
melts and noble gases and its evolution with pressure. Whatever the composition
of the melt and of the NG phase, the surface tension increases when P increases
from 0 to 6 GPa.

challenges by proposing a settingless time-domain unit protection algorithm for

of a protected line, i.e. healthy or with an internal fault, is more consistent
with the input measurements. This is done by solving a number of small-scale
convex optimization problems, which at the same time determine the
characteristics of an internal fault that best fit the measurements. Thus, the
proposed algorithm merges protection, fault location and fault type
identification functionalities. The algorithm's performance is extensively
tested on a grid model in MATLAB Simulink for different types of generation and
grid operating conditions. The results demonstrate that the algorithm can
operate quickly and reliably, and accurately estimate fault characteristics

problem of large-scale traffic signal control (TSC). Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) is a promising method to solve this problem. However, there is
still room for improvement in extending to large-scale problems and modeling
the behaviors of other agents for each individual agent. In this paper, a new
MARL, called Cooperative double Q-learning (Co-DQL), is proposed, which has
several prominent features. It uses a highly scalable independent double
Q-learning method based on double estimators and the UCB policy, which can
eliminate the over-estimation problem existing in traditional independent
Q-learning while ensuring exploration. It uses mean field approximation to
model the interaction among agents, thereby making agents learn a better
cooperative strategy. In order to improve the stability and robustness of the
learning process, we introduce a new reward allocation mechanism and a local
state sharing method. In addition, we analyze the convergence properties of the
proposed algorithm. Co-DQL is applied on TSC and tested on a multi-traffic
signal simulator. According to the results obtained on several traffic
scenarios, Co- DQL outperforms several state-of-the-art decentralized MARL
algorithms. It can effectively shorten the average waiting time of the vehicles
in the whole road system.

literature of analysis, from elementary ones which use ordinary techniques from
measure theory, to more sophisticated ones, such as those employing techniques
from nonstandard analysis, in particular for Riesz representation theorem. In
this paper, as the first goal, we give new proofs for all these three theorems.
Our proofs have a mild logical flavor and are uniform in the sense that they
are all based on the same general idea and rely on the application of the same
technical tool from logic to measure theory, namely logical compactness
theorem. In fact, as the second goal of the paper, we try to reveal more the
power of logical methods in analysis in particular measure theory, and make
stronger connections between analysis and logic. We use the setting of
""integration logic"" which is a logical framework (and one of the forms of
probability logics) for studying measure and probability structures by logical
means. Indeed, we elaborate this setting and use its expressive power and a
version of compactness theorem holding in it to show its application in measure
theory by giving new proofs for the above-mentioned measure existence theorems.
As mentioned, an advantage of these proofs is that they are all given in a
uniform way since they are all based on the logical compactness theorem. The
paper is mostly written for general mathematicians, in particular the people
active in analysis or logic as the main audience. So it is self-contained and
the reader does not need to have any advanced prerequisite knowledge from logic

relationships between latent visual and language summarizations, which
summarize visual regions and question into a small number of latent
representations to avoid modeling uninformative individual region-word

propagated to fuse valuable information from both modalities and are used to
update the visual and word features. Such MLI modules can be stacked for

information theory and quantum mechanics. Szilard engines are in general
operated by a Maxwell's Demon where Landauer's principle resolves the apparent
paradoxes. Here we propose a Szilard engine setup without featuring an explicit
Maxwell's demon. In a demonless Szilard engine, the acquisition of which-side
information is not required, but erasure and the related heat dissipation still
take place implicitly by the very nature of the work extraction process. We see
that the insertion of the partition in a quantum Szilard engine does not
localize the particle to one side, instead it creates a superposition state of
the particle being in both sides. To be able to extract work from the system,
particle has to be localized at one side. The localization occurs as a result
of quantum measurement on the particle, which shows the importance of the
measurement process regardless of whether one uses the acquired information or
not. In accordance with the Landauer's principle, localization by quantum
measurement corresponds to a logically irreversible operation and for this
reason it has to be accompanied by the corresponding heat dissipation. This
shows the validity of the Landauer's principle even in quantum Szilard engines
without Maxwell's demon. Furthermore, we take quantum confinement effects fully
into account to analyze the Szilard cycle in the quantum regime thoroughly and
obtain highly accurate analytical expressions for work and heat exchanges. Our
results show that Landauer's principle holds the key role to understand the
thermodynamics of the localization of the particle by quantum measurement,
which explicitly saves the second law in demonless engines and shows that
quantum-mechanical considerations are essential to reconcile thermodynamics and
information theory.

network of both low-bitwidth weights and activations. Optimizing a
low-precision network is very challenging due to the non-differentiability of
the quantizer, which may result in substantial accuracy loss. To address this,
we propose three practical approaches, including (i) progressive quantization;
(ii) stochastic precision; and (iii) joint knowledge distillation to improve
the network training. First, for progressive quantization, we propose two
schemes to progressively find good local minima. Specifically, we propose to
first optimize a net with quantized weights and subsequently quantize
activations. This is in contrast to the traditional methods which optimize them
simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose a second progressive quantization
scheme which gradually decreases the bit-width from high-precision to
low-precision during training. Second, to alleviate the excessive training
burden due to the multi-round training stages, we further propose a one-stage
stochastic precision strategy to randomly sample and quantize sub-networks
while keeping other parts in full-precision. Finally, we adopt a novel learning
scheme to jointly train a full-precision model alongside the low-precision one.
By doing so, the full-precision model provides hints to guide the low-precision
model training and significantly improves the performance of the low-precision
network. Extensive experiments on various datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, ImageNet)
show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

model $f(R,T)=R+2\chi T$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T= -\rho+p_r+2p_t$

explore and analyze two cases separately. In the first part, wormhole solutions

obtained solution does not satisfy the required wormhole conditions. In the
second part, we introduce an EoS relating with pressure (radial and lateral)

the model via $p_t= n p_r $. Several physical properties and characteristics of

about wormholes. We mainly focus on energy conditions (NEC, WEC and SEC) and
consequently for supporting the respective wormhole geometries in details. In
both cases it is found that the energy density is positive as seen by any

(AR) model is a basic and widely used one, which assumes that each observation
in the time series is a noisy linear combination of some previous observations
along with a constant shift. To tackle the problem of prediction with missing
values, a number of methods were proposed based on various data models. For
real application scenarios, how do these methods perform over different types
of time series with different levels of data missing remains to be
investigated. In this paper, we focus on online methods for AR-model-based time

their different strategies to deal with missing values. We also present
algorithmic implementations for better understanding. In order to

accounted for by adjusting the grid state to the average power feed-in on a
time scale of one minute. The wind power is injected at a single node by
replacing one of the conventional generator nodes in the test grid by a wind
farm. We determine histograms of local frequencies for a large number of
one-minute wind speed sequences taken from the measured data and for different
injection nodes. These histograms exhibit a common type of shape, which can be
described by a Gaussian distribution for small frequencies and a nearly
exponentially decaying tail part. Non-Gaussian features become particularly
pronounced for wind power injection at locations, which are weakly connected to
the main grid structure. This effect is only present when taking into account
the heterogeneities in transmission line and node properties of the grid, while
it disappears upon homogenizing of these features. The standard deviation of
the frequency fluctuations increases linearly with the average injected wind
power.

  Differential Evolution in Numerical Optimization",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fast and efficient stochastic opposition-based learning (OBL) variant is
proposed in this paper. OBL is a machine learning concept to accelerate the
convergence of soft computing algorithms, which consists of simultaneously
calculating an original solution and its opposite. Recently, a stochastic OBL
variant called BetaCOBL was proposed, which is capable of controlling the
degree of opposite solutions, preserving useful information held by original
solutions, and preventing the waste of fitness evaluations. While it has shown
outstanding performance compared to several state-of-the-art OBL variants, the
high computational cost of BetaCOBL may hinder it from cost-sensitive
optimization problems. Also, as it assumes that the decision variables of a
given problem are independent, BetaCOBL may be ineffective for optimizing
inseparable problems. In this paper, we propose an improved BetaCOBL that
mitigates all the limitations. The proposed algorithm called iBetaCOBL reduces
the computational cost from $O(NP^{2} \cdot D)$ to $O(NP \cdot D)$ ($NP$ and
$D$ stand for population size and a dimension, respectively) using a linear
time diversity measure. Also, the proposed algorithm preserves strongly
dependent variables that are adjacent to each other using multiple exponential
crossover. We used differential evolution (DE) variants to evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithm. The results of the performance
evaluations on a set of 58 test functions show the excellent performance of
iBetaCOBL compared to ten state-of-the-art OBL variants, including BetaCOBL.

Kepler light curve of a polar. Although EU Cnc was extremely faint during
campaign 16 and 18 its light curve showed a large-amplitude pulse that lasted
for half of each orbit, which we interpret to be light from an accretion region
that rotates behind the limb of the white dwarf for half of the orbit.
Remarkably, the pulse profile showed no appreciable variability in either
campaign. Additionally, we note weak dips of unknown origin with a depth of
~10% at the beginning and end of the orbital hump. The K2 waveform is
consistent with all previously reported variations on the orbital timescale,
suggesting that EU Cnc has possibly been at the same low state for its entire
observational history. We then explore the possibility that EU Cnc's unusual
combination of a low mass-transfer rate and consistent light curve indicates
the possibility that EU Cnc might be a low-accretion-rate polar (LARP).

detec-tion and diagnosis. The structural characteristics of breast lesion play
an im-portant role in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD). In this paper, a novel
struc-ture-aware triplet path networks (SATPN) was designed to integrate
classifica-tion and two image reconstruction tasks to achieve accurate
diagnosis on US im-ages with small training dataset. Specifically, we enhance
clinically-approved breast lesion structure characteristics though converting
original breast US imag-es to BIRADS-oriented feature maps (BFMs) with a
distance-transformation coupled Gaussian filter. Then, the converted BFMs were
used as the inputs of SATPN, which performed lesion classification task and two
unsupervised stacked convolutional Auto-Encoder (SCAE) networks for benign and
malignant image reconstruction tasks, independently. We trained the SATPN with
an alter-native learning strategy by balancing image reconstruction error and
classification label prediction error. At the test stage, the lesion label was
determined by the weighted voting with reconstruction error and label
prediction error. We com-pared the performance of the SATPN with TPN using
original image as input and our previous developed semi-supervised deep
learning methods using BFMs as inputs. Experimental results on two breast US
datasets showed that SATPN ranked the best among the three networks, with
classification accuracy around 93.5%. These findings indicated that SATPN is
promising for effective breast US lesion CAD using small datasets.

  Representation Learning for Group Recommendation",,,,,"cs.SI cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Frequent group activities of human beings have become an indispensable part
in their daily life. Group recommendation can recommend satisfactory activities
to group members in the recommender systems, and the key issue is how to
aggregate preferences in different group members. Most existing group
recommendation employed the predefined static aggregation strategies to
aggregate the preferences of different group members, but these static
strategies cannot simulate the dynamic group decision-making. Meanwhile, most
of these methods depend on intuitions or assumptions to analyze the influence
of group members and lack of convincing theoretical support. We argue that the
influence of group members plays a particularly important role in group
decision-making and it can better assist group profile modeling and perform
more accurate group recommendation. To tackle the issue of preference
aggregation for group recommendation, we propose a novel attentive aggregation
representation learning method based on sociological theory for group
recommendation, namely SIAGR (short for ""Social Influence-based Attentive Group
Recommendation""), which takes attention mechanisms and the popular method
(BERT) as the aggregation representation for group profile modeling.
Specifically, we analyze the influence of group members based on social
identity theory and two-step flow theory and exploit an attentive mavens mining
method. In addition, we develop a BERT-based representation method to learn the
interaction of group members. Lastly, we complete the group recommendation
under the neural collaborative filtering framework and verify the effectiveness
of the proposed method by experimenting.

characteristic relations for the geometry of secondary structure motifs of
proteins, and we show how this is consistent with the experimental data. After
using the data to universally fix basic local geometric parameters, such as the
curvature and torsion of the helical motifs, we are left with a single free

the principal motifs (alpha helices, beta strands and loops connecting them).

  demultiplexing with regularized digital metamaterials","24 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adiabatic waveguide taper and on-chip wavelength demultiplexer are the key
components of photonic integrated circuits. However, these two kinds of devices
which designed by traditional semi-analytic methods or brute-force search
methods usually have large size. Here, based on regularized digital
metamaterials, we have designed, fabricated and characterized a two-channel
focused wavelength demultiplexer with a footprint of 2.4 x 10 um2. The designed
demultiplexer can directly connect to a grating coupler under the absence of an
adiabatic waveguide taper. The objective first method and modified steepest
descent method are used to design the demultiplexer which splits 1520 nm and
1580 nm light from a 10-um-wide input waveguide into two 0.48-um-wide output
waveguides. Experimental results show that the insertion loss of the upper
(lower) channel of the demultiplexer is -1.77 dB (-2.10 dB) and the crosstalk
is -25.17 dB (-12.14 dB). Besides, the simulation results indicate that the
fabrication tolerance of our devices can reach 20 nm in etching depth and 10 nm
in plane size changing. Benefit From the extensibility of our design method, we
can design other types of ultra-compact 'focused' devices, like mode splitters,
mode converters and power splitters, and we can also design devices with more
complicated functionalities, for example, we have designed a three-channel
focused wavelength demultiplexer.
