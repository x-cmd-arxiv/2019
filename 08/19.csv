spin polarization (spin filtering) across single molecules are currently of
great interest in the field of molecular spintronics. We explore one possible
strategy based on the modification of nanojunction symmetry which can be
realized, for example, by a mechanical strain. Such modification can activate
new molecular orbitals which were inactive before due to their orbital mismatch
with the electrode's conduction states. This can result in several important
consequences such as (i) quantum interference effects appearing as Fano-like
features in electron transmission and (ii) the change in molecular level
hybridization with the electrode's states. We argue that the symmetry change
can affect very differently two majority- and minority-spin conductances and
thus alter significantly the resulting spin-filtering ratio as the junction
symmetry is modified. We illustrate the idea for two basic molecular junctions:
Ni/benzene/Ni (perpendicular vs tilted orientations) and Ni/Si chain/Ni (zigzag
vs linear chains). In both cases, one highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and one lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (out of HOMO and LUMO
doublets) are important. In particular, their destructive interference with
other orbitals leads to dramatic suppression of majority-spin conductance in
low-symmetry configurations. For a minority-spin channel, on the contrary, the
conductance is strongly enhanced when the symmetry is lowered due to an
increase in hybridization strength. We believe that our results may offer a
potential route for creating molecular devices with a large on-off ratio of
spin polarization via quantum interference effects.

approximate particle-hole symmetry is gradually broken and the pseudo nodal
surface turns into a nodal ring belonging to the class AI with fewer
non-spatial symmetries. Also, the nodal ring is shrinking in the process. At
about $31$ GPa, which is higher than the reported structure phase transition
pressure $21$ GPa, the nodal ring shrinks to a nodal point. When above $31$
GPa, all band crossings are gapped out and $\mathrm{YH_3}$ becomes a trivial
insulator eventually.

from high-speed displays to adaptive optics, structured illumination
microscopy, and holography. After decades of advances, SLM arrays based on
liquid crystals can now reach large pixel counts exceeding 10^6 with phase-only
modulation with a pixel pitch of less than 10 {\mu}m and reflectance around
75%. However, the rather slow modulation speed in such SLMs (below hundreds of
Hz) presents limitations for many applications. Here we propose an SLM
architecture that can achieve high pixel count with high-resolution phase-only
modulation at high speed in excess of GHz. The architecture consists of a
tunable two-dimensional array of vertically oriented, one-sided microcavities
that are tuned through an electro-optic material such as barium titanate (BTO).
We calculate that the optimized microcavity design achieves a {\pi} phase shift
under an applied bias voltage below 10 V, while maintaining nearly constant
reflection amplitude. As two model applications, we consider high-speed 2D beam
steering as well as beam forming. The outlined design methodology could also
benefit future design of spatial light modulators with other specifications
(for example amplitude modulators). This high-speed SLM architecture promises a
wide range of new applications ranging from fully tunable metasurfaces to
optical computing accelerators, high-speed interconnects, true 2D phased array
beam steering, and quantum computing with cold atom arrays.

testing is used to ensure that the correct behavior of the software is retained
after updates to the source code. This regression testing becomes costly over
time as the number of test cases increases and it makes sense to prioritize
test cases in order to execute fault-detecting test cases as soon as possible.
There are many coverage-based test case prioritization (TCP) methods that only
use the code coverage data to prioritize test cases. By incorporating the
fault-proneness estimations of code units into the coverage-based TCP methods,
we can improve such techniques.
  Objective: In this paper, we aim to propose an approach which improves
coverage-based TCP methods by considering the fault-proneness distribution over
code units. Further, we present the results of an empirical study that shows
using our proposed approach significantly improves the additional strategy,
which is a widely used coverage-based TCP method.
  Method: The approach presented in this study uses the bug history of the
software in order to introduce a defect prediction method to learn a neural
network model. This model is then used to estimate fault-proneness of each area
of the source code and then the estimations are incorporated into
coverage-based TCP methods. Our proposed approach is a general idea that can be
applied to many coverage-based methods, such as the additional and total TCP
methods.
  Results: The proposed methods are evaluated on datasets collected from the
development history of five real-world projects including 357 versions in
total. The experiments show that using an appropriate bug history can improve
coverage-based TCP methods.

with DRAM is essential, and the combination can effectively bridge the
performance gap and provide reasonable performance with higher capacity. We
also identify NUMA-related performance characteristics for accesses to memory
on a remote socket. In the second part, we employ two fine-grained allocation
policies to control traffic distribution between DRAM and NVM. Our results show
that bandwidth spilling between DRAM and NVM could provide 2.0x bandwidth and
enable $20\%$ larger problems than using DRAM as a cache. Also, write isolation
between DRAM and NVM could save up to 3.9x energy and improves bandwidth by
3.1x compared to DRAM-cached NVM. We establish a roofline model to explore
power and energy efficiency at various distributions of read-only traffic. Our
results show that NVM requires 1.8x lower power than DRAM for data-intensive
workloads. Overall, applications can significantly optimize performance and
power efficiency by adapting traffic distribution to NVM and DRAM through
memory configurations and fine-grained policies to fully exploit the new memory

semiconductor devices. Unfortunately, its manufacturing leaves a high density
of defects in the layer, which can be reduced by a treatment with hydrogen
radicals. Here, we present an optimized hydrogen treatment, which is used for
best performing solar cells made of solution-processed amorphous silicon. We
examine the amount and the nature of hydrogen incorporation using infrared
absorption and hydrogen effusion. The hydrogen treatment not only increases
hydrogen content significantly, it also enlarges the fraction of hydrogen in a
bonding configuration which is known to be advantageous for electronic
properties, albeit only close to the surface. Using electron spin resonance and
and photothermal deflection spectroscopy spectra, we confirm a reduction of
defect density. Regarding the electrical properties, the ratio of photo and
dark conductivity is increased by almost two decades. This leads to a greatly
enhanced performance of solar cell devices which use the material as the
absorber layer. In particular, the efficiency jumps by a factor of three.

intractable constants due to its reliability and robustness. The celebrated
balance heuristic estimator belongs to this class of methods and has proved
very successful in computer graphics. The basic ingredients for computing the
estimator are: a set of proposal distributions, indexed by some discrete label,
and a predetermined number of draws from each of these proposals. However, if
the number of available proposals is much larger than the number of permitted
importance points, one needs to select, possibly at random, which of these
distributions will be used. The focus of this work lies within the previous
context, exploring some improvements and variations of the balance heuristic
via a novel extended-space representation of the estimator, leading to
straightforward annealing schemes for variance reduction purposes. In addition,
we also look at the intractable scenario where the proposal density is only
available as a joint function with the discrete label, as may be encountered in
problems where an ordering is imposed. For this case, we look at combinations
of correlated unbiased estimators which also fit into the extended-space
representation and, in turn, will provide other interesting solutions.

scalability demands has resulted in increasing popularity of cloud computing.
Optimizing the performance and power consumption of cloud resources is
therefore crucial to relieve the costs of data centers. In recent years,
multi-FPGA platforms have gained traction in data centers as low-cost yet
high-performance solutions particularly as acceleration engines, thanks to the
high degree of parallelism they provide. Nonetheless, the size of data centers
workloads varies during service time, leading to significant underutilization
of computing resources while consuming a large amount of power, which turns out
as a key factor of data center inefficiency, regardless of the underlying
hardware structure. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to
throttle the power consumption of multi-FPGA platforms by dynamically scaling
the voltage and hereby frequency during runtime according to prediction of, and
adjustment to the workload level, while maintaining the desired Quality of
Service (QoS). This is in contrast to, and more efficient than, conventional
approaches that merely scale (i.e., power-gate) the computing nodes or
frequency. The proposed framework carefully exploits a pre-characterized
library of delay-voltage, and power-voltage information of FPGA resources,
which we show is indispensable to obtain the efficient operating point due to
the different sensitivity of resources w.r.t. voltage scaling, particularly
considering multiple power rails residing in these devices. Our evaluations by
implementing state-of-the-art deep neural network accelerators revealed that,
providing an average power reduction of 4.0X, the proposed framework surpasses
the previous works by 33.6% (up to 83%).

dynamical equations of rotating stably stratified fluids where the action of
the Coriolis acceleration along the direction of the entropy (and chemicals)
stratification is neglected while assuming that the fluid motions are mostly
horizontal because of their inhibition in the vertical direction by the
buoyancy force. This leads to neglect the horizontal projection of the rotation
vector in the equations for the dynamics of gravito-inertial waves (GIWs) that
become separable as in the non-rotating case while they are not in the case
with the full Coriolis acceleration. This approximation has been broadly
applied in stellar (and planetary) astrophysics to study low-frequency GIWs.
TAR is built on the assumptions that the star is spherical (i.e. its
centrifugal deformation is neglected) and uniformly rotating while an adiabatic
treatment of the dynamics of the waves is adopted. However, it has been
recently generalised with including the effects of a differential rotation. We
aim to do a new generalisation that takes into account the centrifugal
acceleration in the case of moderately uniformly rotating deformed stars. As in
the case of a differentially rotating spherical star, the problem becomes 2D
but can be treated analytically if assuming the Cowling, anelastic and JWKB
approximations, which are relevant for low-frequency GIWs. It allows us to
derive a generalised Laplace tidal equation for the horizontal eigenfunctions
and asymptotic wave periods that can be used to probe the structure and
dynamics of rotating deformed stars thanks to asteroseismology. A first
numerical exploration of its eigenvalues and horizontal eigenfunctions shows
their variation as a function of the pseudo-radius for different rotation rates
and frequencies and the development of avoided crossings.

fundamental challenge to our traditional understanding of star clusters as
`single stellar populations.' The clear MS bifurcation of early-type stars with
masses greater than $\sim1.6 M_\odot$ is thought to result from a range in the
stellar rotation rates. However, direct evidence connecting double MSs to
stellar rotation properties has yet to emerge. Here, we show through analysis
of the projected stellar rotational velocities ($v\sin i$, where $i$ represents
the star's inclination angle) that the well-separated double MS in the young,

dichotomous distribution of stellar rotation rates. We discuss whether our
observations may reflect the effects of tidal locking affecting a fraction of
the cluster's member stars in stellar binary systems. We show that the slow
rotators could potentially be initially rapidly rotating stars that have been
slowed down by tidal locking by a low mass-ratio companion in a cluster
containing a large fraction of short-period, low-mass-ratio binaries. This
demonstrates that stellar rotation drives the split MSs in young, $\lessapprox

Milky Way open cluster NGC 2287 and suggest that stellar rotation may drive the
split MSs in NGC 2287. We find that the observed distribution of projected
stellar rotation velocities could result from a dichotomous distribution of
stellar rotation rates. We discuss whether our observations may reflect the
effects of tidal locking affecting a fraction of the cluster's member stars in
stellar binary systems. The slow rotators are likely stars that initially
rotated rapidly but subsequently slowed down through tidal locking induced by
low-mass-ratio binary systems. However, the cluster may have a much larger
population of short-period binaries than is usually seen in the literature,
with relatively low secondary masses.

  Systems (ASYNC 2018)",,,,"cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a power efficient clock-less fully asynchronous bit-serial Low
Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) link with event-driven instant wake-up
and self-sleep features, optimized for high speed inter-chip communication of
asynchronous address-events between neuromorphic chips. The proposed LVDS link
makes use of the Level-Encoded Dual-Rail (LEDR) representation and a token-ring
architecture to encode and transmit data, avoiding the use of conventional
large ClockData Recovery (CDR) modules with power-hungry DLL or PLL circuits.
We implemented the LVDS circuits in a device fabricated with a standard 0.18 um
CMOS process. The total silicon area used for such block is of 0.14 mm^2. We
present experimental measurement results to demonstrate that, with a bit rate
of 1.5 Gbps and an event width of 32-bit, the proposed LVDS link can achieve
transmission event rates of 35.7 M Events/second with current consumption of
19.3 mA and 3.57 mA for receiver and transmitter blocks, respectively. Given
the clock-less and instant on/off design choices made, the power consumption of
the whole link depends linearly on the data transmission rate. We show that the
current consumption can go down to sub-uA for low event rates (e.g., <1k
Events/second), with a floor of 80 nA for transmitter and 42 nA for receiver,
determined mainly by static off-leakage currents.

field and subjected to an ac drive. If the drive is polarized in the plane
perpendicular to the dc field, the drive photons are resonantly absorbed when
the spacing between the Zeeman levels is close to the photon energy. This is
the only resonance when the drive is circularly polarized. For linearly
polarized drive, additional resonances corresponding to absorption of three,
five, and multiple odd numbers of photons is possible. Interaction with the
environment causes the broadening of the absorption lines. We demonstrate that
the interaction with environment enables the forbidden two-photon absorption.
We adopt a model of the environment in the form of random telegraph noise
produced by a single fluctuator. As a result of the synchronous time
fluctuations of different components of the random field, the shape of the
two-photon absorption line is non-Lorentzian and depends dramatically on the
drive amplitude. This shape is a monotonic curve at strong drive, while, at
weak drive, it develops a two-peak structure reminiscent of an induced
transparency on resonance.

Core (IRC), close to the nuclear disk major axis. The spatial resolution was
0.35""($\sim$6 pc) and the slit length 14""($\sim$240 pc). The spectral
resolution was $\sim$74000, unprecedented high for galactic nuclei observations
at $\sim$2.1$\mu$m. The line profiles appear highly complex, with blue
asymmetry up to 3.5'' away of the IRC, and red asymmetries further away to NE.
Several Gaussian components are necessary to fit the profile, nevertheless a
narrow and a wide ones predominate. The IRC presents kinematic widths above 700
kms$^{-1}$ (FWZI), and broad component FWHM$\sim$400 kms$^{-1}$, the highest
detected in a nearby galaxy. At the IRC, the blue-shifted broad component
displays a 90 km s$^{-1}$ bump in radial velocity distribution, a feature we
previously detected in molecular gas kinematics. The narrow component velocity
dispersion ($\sim$32 kms$^{-1}$) is within the expected for normal galaxies and
LIRGs. Intermediate components (FWHM$\sim$150 kms$^{-1}$, red-shifted to NE,
blue-shifted to SW) appear at some positions, as well as weaker blue (-215
kms$^{-1}$) and red line wings (+300 kms$^{-1}$). The IRC depicts a large broad
vs. narrow line flux-ratio (F(B)/F(N)$\sim$1.35), and the broad component seems
only comparable with those observed at very high star-forming rate galaxies.

based on the closed-form solution of principal lines (PLs), with their
intersection being the principal point while each PL can concisely represent
relative orientation/position (up to one degree of freedom for both) between a
special pair of coordinate systems of image plane and calibration pattern. With

low-dimensional space and its applications for graph tasks have gained
significant traction in academia and industry. The primary difference among the
many recently proposed graph embedding methods is the way they preserve the
inherent properties of the graphs. However, in practice, comparing these
methods is very challenging. The majority of methods report performance boosts
on few selected real graphs. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize these
performance improvements to other types of graphs. Given a graph, it is
currently impossible to quantify the advantages of one approach over another.
In this work, we introduce a principled framework to compare graph embedding
methods. Our goal is threefold: (i) provide a unifying framework for comparing
the performance of various graph embedding methods, (ii) establish a benchmark
with real-world graphs that exhibit different structural properties, and (iii)
provide users with a tool to identify the best graph embedding method for their
data. This paper evaluates 4 of the most influential graph embedding methods
and 4 traditional link prediction methods against a corpus of 100 real-world
networks with varying properties. We organize the 100 networks in terms of
their properties to get a better understanding of the embedding performance of
these popular methods. We use the comparisons on our 100 benchmark graphs to
define GFS-score, that can be applied to any embedding method to quantify its
performance. We rank the state-of-the-art embedding approaches using the
GFS-score and show that it can be used to understand and evaluate novel
embedding approaches. We envision that the proposed framework
(https://www.github.com/palash1992/GEM-Benchmark) will serve the community as a
benchmarking platform to test and compare the performance of future graph

the neighborhood constraint imposed by mesh topology ensuring smooth surface

deformations induced by body shape variations and can therefore learn
high-resolution meshes going ahead. We show comparable performance with SoA (in

modeling cost and therefore real-time reconstructions on three publicly

system specifications for weak semantics on the basis of a decomposition method
for modal formulas. The idea is that a congruence format for a semantics must
ensure that the formulas in the modal characterisation of this semantics are
always decomposed into formulas that are again in this modal characterisation.
The stability and divergence requirements that are imposed on many of the known
weak semantics have so far been outside the realm of this method. Stability
refers to the absence of a $\tau$-transition. We show, using the decomposition
method, how congruence formats can be relaxed for weak semantics that are
stability-respecting. This relaxation for instance brings the priority operator
within the range of the stability-respecting branching bisimulation format.
Divergence, which refers to the presence of an infinite sequence of
$\tau$-transitions, escapes the inductive decomposition method. We circumvent
this problem by proving that a congruence format for a stability-respecting

use of two innovations to attention-modeling in weakly-supervised learning.
First, and most notably, our framework uses an attention model to extract both
foreground and background frames whose appearance is explicitly modeled. Most
prior works ignore the background, but we show that modeling it allows our
system to learn a richer notion of actions and their temporal extents. Second,
we combine bottom-up, class-agnostic attention modules with top-down,
class-specific activation maps, using the latter as form of self-supervision
for the former. Doing so allows our model to learn a more accurate model of
attention without explicit temporal supervision. These modifications lead to
10% AP@IoU=0.5 improvement over existing systems on THUMOS14. Our proposed
weaklysupervised system outperforms recent state-of-the-arts by at least 4.3%
AP@IoU=0.5. Finally, we demonstrate that weakly-supervised learning can be used

anisotropy in the basal plane. This property renders black phosphorus unique
applications not achievable with other two-dimensional materials. In this work,
however, we discover a remarkable isotropic behavior in the strongly

the HDP methods or between the unsupervised methods. This shows the HDP methods
and the unsupervised methods are complementary to each other in identifying
defective models to some extent. Finally, we investigate the feasibility of
five HDP methods by considering two satisfactory criteria recommended by
previous CPDP studies and find the satisfactory ratio of these HDP methods is
still pessimistic. The above empirical results implicate there is still a long

temperature estimated from an intensity ratio of Fe XXVI Ly alpha/Fe XXV He
alpha lines is lower than the electron temperature, which suggests that the ICM
is in the non-ionization equilibrium (NEI) state. The spectrum in the central
region can be also fitted with a two-component model: a two-temperature plasma
model in a collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) with temperatures of 7.9

photon index of 1.1. The two component models can represent the intensity ratio

the outer region (r>300'') can be explained by a single CIE plasma model with a
temperature of 5-8 keV. Based on the spectral feature and its circular

The function energizes the geometry similarly as divisors do in the continuum,

Define the n times n matrices L=L^--(x,y)=E[W^-(x) cap W^-(y)] and L^++(x,y) =

the complexity growth rate and found that they share similar behaviors with

XHand, recommends correction code for such an occurring exception. We have

modulus of continuity $\alpha$. Let $G$ be a finitely generated group admitting
a $C^{1,\alpha}$ action $\rho$ with a free orbit on the circle, and such that
the logarithms of derivatives of group elements are uniformly bounded at some
point of the circle. We prove that if $G$ has spherical growth bounded by $c

some mild technical assumptions on $\alpha$, there is a sequence of exceptional
$C^{1,\alpha}$ actions of $G$ which converge to $\rho$ in the $C^1$ topology.
As a consequence for a single diffeomorphism, we obtain that if the function

nearly incompressible material which exhibits substantial hysteresis even under
very slow (quasistatic) loading conditions. In this paper, a series of uniaxial
cyclic loading tests of porcine and rat skin at different strain rates and with
samples oriented in different directions (with respect to the spine) were
conducted to study the effect of strain rate and samples orientations with
respect to spine on mullins effect and skin inelastic response. A noteworthy
feature of skin is that, similar to certain filled rubbers, its mechanical
response shifts after the first extension and exhibits softening and hysteresis
when loaded under cyclic tension and mullins effect is observed. The results of
these strain-controlled cyclic loading tests also indicated that the extent of
softening is different for different strain rates and orientations. Also a
substantial hysteresis persists even at very low strain rates indicating
inelastic behavior beyond the rate sensitive viscoelastic response. Through
this series of experiments, by investigating the effect of strain rate on pig
skin and rat skin, we conclude that the skin response is rate dependent but
inelastic and shows irreversible changes in fiber orientation which are
observed in histology results. Also, skin shows persistent deformation that is
only partially recovered even after a long period of unloading.

velocity $\Omega_i$ and the outer cylinder is stationary. A simple empirical
model of the turbulent, TC flow is developed consisting of near-wall, log-like
turbulent wall layers separated by an annulus of constant angular momentum. The
model is closed by a proposed scaling relation concerning the thickness of the
wall layer on the inner cylinder. Model results include the Nusselt number $Nu$
(torque required to maintain the flow) and various measures of the wall-layer
thickness as a function of both the Taylor {number} $Ta$ and $\eta$. These
agree reasonably with experimental measurements, direct numerical simulation
(DNS) and the present LES over a range of both $Ta$ and $\eta$. In particular,
the model shows that, at fixed $\eta<1$, $Nu$ grows like $Ta^{1/2}$ divided by
the square of the Lambert, (or Product-Log) function of a variable proportional
to $Ta^{1/4}$. This cannot be represented by a power law dependence on $Ta$. At
the same time the wall-layer thicknesses reduce slowly in relation to the
cylinder gap. This suggests an asymptotic, very large $Ta$ state consisting of
constant angular momentum in the cylinder gap with $u_\theta =
0.5\,\Omega_i\,R_i^2/r$, where $r$ is the radius, with vanishingly thin
turbulent wall layers at the cylinder surfaces. An extension of the model to
rough-wall turbulent wall flow at the inner cylinder surface is described. This
shows an asymptotic, fully rough-wall state where the torque is independent of

connecting text to image. We present a conceptually simple, flexible and
general framework using sequence to sequence (seq-to-seq) learning for this
task. The framework, called Seq-SG2SL, derives sequence proxies for the two
modality and a Transformer-based seq-to-seq model learns to transduce one into
the other. A scene graph is decomposed into a sequence of semantic fragments
(SF), one for each relationship. A semantic layout is represented as the
consequence from a series of brick-action code segments (BACS), dictating the
position and scale of each object bounding box in the layout. Viewing the two
building blocks, SF and BACS, as corresponding terms in two different
vocabularies, a seq-to-seq model is fittingly used to translate. A new metric,
semantic layout evaluation understudy (SLEU), is devised to evaluate the task
of semantic layout prediction inspired by BLEU. SLEU defines relationships
within a layout as unigrams and looks at the spatial distribution for n-grams.
Unlike the binary precision of BLEU, SLEU allows for some tolerances spatially
through thresholding the Jaccard Index and is consequently more adapted to the
task. Experimental results on the challenging Visual Genome dataset show
improvement over a non-sequential approach based on graph convolution.

However, most of the previous studies are restricted to separating a few

can explicitly encode the source information from a query signal regardless of
the number and/or kind of target signals. The proposed method consists of a
Query-net and a Separator: given a query and a mixture, the Query-net encodes
the query into the latent space, and the Separator estimates masks conditioned
by the latent vector, which is then applied to the mixture for separation. The
Separator can also generate masks using the latent vector from the training
samples, allowing separation in the absence of a query. We evaluate our method
on the MUSDB18 dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed method
can separate multiple sources with a single network. In addition, through
further investigation of the latent space we demonstrate that our method can
generate continuous outputs via latent vector interpolation.

strong interference due to contentcentric base station association. This may
degenerate the advantage of collaborative content caching among multiple small
base stations (SBSs), including probabilistic caching and coded caching. In
this work, we tackle this issue by deploying multiple antennas at each SBS for
interference management. Two types of beamforming are considered. One is
matched-filter (MF) to strengthen the effective channel gain of the desired
signal, and the other is zero-forcing (ZF) to cancel interference within a
selected SBS cooperation group. We apply these two beamforming techniques in
both probabilistic caching and coded caching, and conduct performance analysis
using stochastic geometry. We obtain exact and approximate compact integral
expressions of system performances measured by average fractional offloaded
traffic (AFOT) and average ergodic spectral efficiency (AESE). Based on these
expressions, we then optimize the caching parameters for AFOT or AESE
maximization. For probabilistic caching, optimal caching solutions are
obtained. For coded caching, an efficient greedy-based algorithm is proposed.
Numerical results show that multiple antennas can boost the advantage of
probabilistic caching and coded caching over the traditional most popular

the same inference rules so that a unified and consistent process algebra model

called ""nil"" that any process can take. This nil event will do nothing
meaningful and leave nothing on a process's observable record. With the nil
event and its well-defined rules, we can successfully use the $\rightarrow$
operator to formally describe a process's complete behavior in its whole life

fully describe the STOP process's internal behavior and conclude that the

that it is difficult to understand the rationale of the model predictions and

deep learning in clinical practice. In this paper we ask if two existing local
interpretability methods, Grad-CAM and Kernel SHAP, can shed light on
convolutional neural networks trained in the context of melanoma detection. Our
contributions are (i) we first explore the domain space via a reproducible,
end-to-end learning framework that creates a suite of 30 models, all trained on
a publicly available data set (HAM10000), (ii) we next explore the reliability
of GradCAM and Kernel SHAP in this context via some basic sanity check
experiments (iii) finally, we investigate a random selection of models from our
suite using GradCAM and Kernel SHAP. We show that despite high accuracy, the
models will occasionally assign importance to features that are not relevant to
the diagnostic task. We also show that models of similar accuracy will produce
different explanations as measured by these methods. This work represents first
steps in bridging the gap between model accuracy and interpretability in the

The mixture components are based on AdaptSPEC, a nonparametric model which
adaptively divides the time series into an unknown number of segments and
estimates the local log spectra by smoothing splines. We extend AdaptSPEC to
handle missing values, a common feature of time series which can cause
difficulties for nonparametric spectral methods. A second extension is to allow
for a time varying mean. Covariates, assumed to be time-independent, are
incorporated via the mixture weights using the logistic stick breaking process.
The model can estimate time varying means and spectra at observed and
unobserved covariate values, allowing for predictive inference. Estimation is
performed by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, combining data
augmentation, reversible jump, and Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
techniques. We evaluate the methodology using simulated data, and describe
applications to Australian rainfall data and measles incidence in the US.
Software implementing the method proposed in this paper is available in the R

square lattice have been theoretically investigated, putting emphasis on how
the occurrence of a phase transition is reflected in spin and thermal
transports. As is well known, the anisotropy of the exchange interaction
$\Delta\equiv J_z/J_x$ plays a role to control the universality class of the
transition of the model, i.e., either a second-order transition at $T_N$ into a
magnetically ordered state or the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition at
$T_{KT}$, which respectively occur for the Ising-type ($\Delta >1$) and
$XY$-type ($\Delta <1$) anisotropies, while for the isotropic Heisenberg case
of $\Delta=1$, a phase transition does not occur at any finite temperature. It
is found by means of the hybrid Monte-Carlo and spin-dynamics simulations that
the spin current probes the difference in the ordering properties, while the
thermal current does not. For the $XY$-type anisotropy, the longitudinal
spin-current conductivity $\sigma^s_{xx}$ ($=\sigma^s_{yy}$) exhibits a
divergence at $T_{KT}$ of the exponential form, $\sigma^s_{xx} \propto
\exp\big[ B/\sqrt{T/T_{KT}-1 }\, \big]$ with $B={\cal O}(1)$, while for the
Ising-type anisotropy, the temperature dependence of $\sigma^s_{xx}$ is almost
monotonic without showing a clear anomaly at $T_{N}$ and such a monotonic
behavior is also the case in the Heisenberg-type spin system. The significant
enhancement of $\sigma^s_{xx}$ at $T_{KT}$ is found to be due to the
exponential rapid growth of the spin-current-relaxation time toward $T_{KT}$,
which can be understood as a manifestation of the topological nature of a
vortex whose lifetime is expected to get longer toward $T_{KT}$. Possible
experimental platforms for the spin-transport phenomena associated with the KT
topological transition are discussed.

light quarks is one of the main sources of errors in the extraction of the
strong coupling from hadronic $\tau$ decays. Several approximate estimates of
the next coefficients of the corresponding Adler function have been proposed,
using various arguments. In the present paper we exploit the analytic structure
of the Adler function in the Borel plane, which allows the definition of an
improved perturbative expansion in powers of a conformal variable which maps
the cut Borel plane onto the unit disk. The new expansions converge in a larger
domain of the Borel plane and, when reexpanded in powers of the strong
coupling, yield definite values for the higher perturbative coefficients. We
apply the method to the Adler function in the $\bar{\rm MS}$ scheme and to a
suitable weighted integral of this function in the complex $s$ plane, chosen
such as to avoid model-dependent assumptions on analyticity. Our results
$c_{5,1}=287 \pm 40$, $c_{6,1}=2948 \pm 208$ and $c_{7,1}=(1.89 \pm 0.75)\times
10^4$, for the six, seven and eigth-loop coefficients, respectively, agree with
a recent determination from Pad\'e approximants applied to the perturbative
expansion of the hadronic $\tau$ decay rate.

concurrency is challenging. This challenge becomes even harder when some timing
constants are missing or unknown. Parametric timed formalisms, such as
parametric timed automata (PTAs), tackle the synthesis of such timing constants
(seen as parameters) for which a property holds. Such formalisms are highly
expressive, but also undecidable, and few decidable subclasses were proposed.
We propose here a syntactic restriction on PTAs consisting in removing guards
(constraints on transitions) to keep only invariants (constraints on
locations). While this restriction preserves the expressiveness of PTAs (and
therefore their undecidability), an additional restriction on the type of
constraints allows to not only prove decidability, but also to perform the
exact synthesis of parameter valuations satisfying reachability. This
formalism, that seems trivial at first sight as it benefits from the
decidability of the reachability problem with a better complexity than Timed
Automata (TAs), suffers from the undecidability of the whole TCTL logic that
TAs, on the contrary enjoy. We believe our formalism allows for an interesting
trade-off between decidability and practical expressiveness and is therefore
promising. We show its applicability in a small case study.

problem over a network of clustered agents each consisted of a set of

can form a connected undirected graph topology. The total cost in this
optimization problem is the sum of the local convex costs of the subagents of
each cluster. We seek a minimizer of this cost subject to a set of affine
equality constraints, and a set of affine inequality constraints specifying the
bounds on the decision variables if such bounds exist. We design our
distributed algorithm in a cluster-based framework which results in a
significant reduction in communication and computation costs. Our proposed
distributed solution is a novel continuous-time algorithm that is linked to the
augmented Lagrangian approach. It converges asymptotically when the local cost
functions are convex and exponentially when they are strongly convex and have
Lipschitz gradients. Moreover, we use an $\epsilon$-exact penalty function to
address the inequality constraints and derive an explicit lower bound on the
penalty function weight to guarantee convergence to $\epsilon$-neighborhood of
the global minimum value of the cost. A numerical example demonstrates our
results.

their demands for CS professionals. Despite this, many jobs remain unfilled.
Furthermore, employees with computational thinking (CT) skills are required,

technology related fields is a serious problem. Even if companies want to hire
women in technology, the number of women who enter these fields is remarkably
low. In high schools, most teenagers acquire only low-level skills in CS. Thus,
they may never understand the fundamental concepts of CS, have unrealistic
expectations or preconceptions, and are influenced by stereotype-based
expectations. Consequently, many teenagers exclude computing as a career path.
In this research study, we present two promising concepts to overcome these
challenges. First, we consider alternative paths to enter the field of CS. In
2018, a voluntary lecture ""Design your own app"" at the University of Graz for
students of all degree programs was introduced. In total, 202 students
participated. We applied a Game Development-Based Learning (GDBL) approach with
the visual coding tool Pocket Code, a mobile app developed at Graz University
of Technology. The students were supposed to create simple games directly on
smartphones. The course received positive evaluations and led to our second
concept; In January 2019, we started to design a MOOC (Massive Open Online
Course) with the title ""Get FIT in Computer Science"". First, this course can be
used to encourage young women who have little to no previous knowledge in CS.
Second, it should help all teenagers to get a more realistic picture of CS to
its basic concepts. Third, teachers can use the course materials to lead high
school classes (Open Educational Resources). Finally, the MOOC can be accessed
by everyone interested in this topic.

entropy,$S_\mathrm{BH}$, is carried by the chaotic microscopic degrees of
freedom, which live in the near horizon region and have a Hilbert space of
states of finite dimension $d=\exp(S_\mathrm{BH})$. In previous work we have
proposed that the near horizon geometry, when the microscopic degrees of
freedom can be resolved, can be described by the AdS$_2[\mathbb{Z}_N]$
discrete, finite and random geometry, where $N\propto S_\mathrm{BH}$. It has
been constructed by purely arithmetic and group theoretical methods in order to
explain, in a direct way, the finiteness of the entropy, $S_\mathrm{BH}$. What
has been left as an open problem is how the smooth AdS$_2$ geometry can be
recovered, in the limit when $N\to\infty$. In the present article we solve this
problem, by showing that the discrete and finite AdS$_2[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ geometry
can be embedded in a family of finite geometries, AdS$_2^M[\mathbb{Z}_N]$,
where $M$ is another integer. This family can be constructed by an appropriate
toroidal compactification and discretization of the ambient $(2+1)$-dimensional
Minkowski space-time. In this construction $N$ and $M$ can be understood as
""infrared"" and ""ultraviolet"" cutoffs respectively. The above construction
enables us to obtain the continuum limit of the AdS$_2^M[\mathbb{Z}_N]$
discrete and finite geometry, by taking both $N$ and $M$ to infinity in a
specific correlated way, following a reverse process: Firstly, by recovering
the continuous, toroidally compactified, AdS$_2[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ geometry by
removing the ultraviolet cutoff; secondly, by removing the infrared cutoff in a
specific decompactification limit, while keeping the radius of AdS$_2$ finite.
It is in this way that we recover the standard non-compact AdS$_2$ continuum
space-time. This method can be applied directly to higher-dimensional AdS
spacetimes.

sequences of asynchronous discrete events (a.k.a., ``spikes'') in response to
changes in scene reflectance. Unlike conventional active pixel sensing (APS),
NVS allows for significantly higher event sampling rates at substantially
increased energy efficiency and robustness to illumination changes. However,
object classification with NVS streams cannot leverage on state-of-the-art
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), since NVS does not produce frame
representations. To circumvent this mismatch between sensing and processing
with CNNs, we propose a compact graph representation for NVS. We couple this
with novel residual graph CNN architectures and show that, when trained on
spatio-temporal NVS data for object classification, such residual graph CNNs
preserve the spatial and temporal coherence of spike events, while requiring
less computation and memory. Finally, to address the absence of large
real-world NVS datasets for complex recognition tasks, we present and make
available a 100k dataset of NVS recordings of the American sign language
letters, acquired with an iniLabs DAVIS240c device under real-world conditions.

electromagnetic wave characteristics to one another, including the respective
effective wave speeds and attenuation coefficients, which facilitate
multifunctional material design. This is achieved by deriving accurate formulas
for the effective electromagnetic and elastodynamic properties that depend on
the wavelengths of the incident waves and the microstructure via the spectral
density. Our formulas enable us to explore the wave characteristics of a broad
class of disordered microstructures because they apply, unlike conventional
formulas, for a wide range of incident wavelengths, i.e., well beyond the
long-wavelength regime. This capability enables us to study the dynamic
properties of exotic disordered ``hyperuniform'' composites that can have
advantages over crystalline ones, such as nearly optimal, direction-independent
properties and robustness against defects. We specifically show that disordered
``stealthy'' hyperuniform microstructures exhibit novel wave characteristics,
e.g., low-pass filters that transmit waves ``isotropically'' up to a finite
wavenumber. Our cross-property relations for the effective wave characteristics
can be applied to design multifunctional composites via inverse techniques.
Design examples include structural components that require high stiffness and

the study of various aspects of self-organization and morphogenesis, such as
the emergence of spatially localized patterns. However, findings of
self-organized patterns in such models have so far relied on manual tuning of

patterns. In this paper, we formulate the problem of automated discovery of
diverse self-organized patterns in such high-dimensional complex dynamical

continuous GOL as a testbed, we show that recent intrinsically-motivated
machine learning algorithms (POP-IMGEPs), initially developed for learning of
inverse models in robotics, can be transposed and used in this novel
application area. These algorithms combine intrinsically-motivated goal
exploration and unsupervised learning of goal space representations. Goal space
representations describe the interesting features of patterns for which diverse
variations should be discovered. In particular, we compare various approaches
to define and learn goal space representations from the perspective of
discovering diverse spatially localized patterns. Moreover, we introduce an
extension of a state-of-the-art POP-IMGEP algorithm which incrementally learns
a goal representation using a deep auto-encoder, and the use of CPPN primitives

cascade stages is designed to train cascade classifiers through
backpropagation. Our proposed method has been evaluated on Pascal VOC and
several challenging datasets like BSBDV 2017, CityPersons, etc. Our method

the heat-flux carried by the strahl or beaming electrons is expected to be
regulated by the self-generated instabilities. Recently, simultaneous field and
particle observations have indeed revealed enhanced whistler-like fluctuations
in the presence of counter-beaming populations of electrons, connecting these
fluctuations to the whistler heat-flux instability (WHFI). This instability is
predicted only for limited conditions of electron beam-plasmas, and was not
captured in numerical simulations yet. In this letter we report the first
simulations of WHFI in particle-in-cell (PIC) setups, realistic for the solar
wind conditions, and without temperature gradients or anisotropies to trigger
the instability in the initiation phase. The velocity distributions have a
complex reaction to the enhanced whistler fluctuations conditioning the
instability saturation by a decrease of the relative drifts combined with
induced (effective) temperature anisotropies (heating the core electrons and
pitch-angle and energy scattering the strahl). These results are in good
agreement with a recent quasilinear approach, and support therefore a largely
accepted belief that WHFI saturates at moderate amplitudes. In anti-sunward
direction the strahl becomes skewed with a pitch-angle distribution decreasing
in width as electron energy increases, that seems to be characteristic to
self-generated whistlers and not to small-scale turbulence.

airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) applications, such as topographic
mapping, forest monitoring, power line detection, and road detection. However,
due to the sensor noise, high redundancy, incompleteness, and complexity of
airborne LiDAR systems, point cloud classification is challenging. In this
paper, we proposed a directionally constrained fully convolutional neural
network (D-FCN) that can take the original 3D coordinates and LiDAR intensity
as input; thus, it can directly apply to unstructured 3D point clouds for
semantic labeling. Specifically, we first introduce a novel directionally
constrained point convolution (D-Conv) module to extract locally representative
features of 3D point sets from the projected 2D receptive fields. To make full
use of the orientation information of neighborhood points, the proposed D-Conv
module performs convolution in an orientation-aware manner by using a
directionally constrained nearest neighborhood search. Then, we designed a
multiscale fully convolutional neural network with downsampling and upsampling
blocks to enable multiscale point feature learning. The proposed D-FCN model
can therefore process input point cloud with arbitrary sizes and directly
predict the semantic labels for all the input points in an end-to-end manner.
Without involving additional geometry features as input, the proposed method
has demonstrated superior performance on the International Society for
Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 3D labeling benchmark dataset. The
results show that our model has achieved a new state-of-the-art level of
performance with an average F1 score of 70.7%, and it has improved the

Starting from current methodologies for SRs, we replaced the steps of
keywording and data extraction with an automatic methodology for generating a
domain ontology and classifying the primary studies. This methodology has been
applied in the Software Engineering sub-area of Software Architecture and
evaluated by human annotators. Results. The result is a novel Expert-Driven
Automatic Methodology, EDAM, for assisting researchers in performing SRs. EDAM
combines ontology-learning techniques and semantic technologies with the
human-in-the-loop. The first (thanks to automation) fosters scalability,
objectivity, reproducibility and granularity of the studies; the second allows
tailoring to the specific focus of the study at hand and knowledge reuse from
domain experts. We evaluated EDAM on the field of Software Architecture against
six senior researchers. As a result, we found that the performance of the
senior researchers in classifying papers was not statistically significantly
different from EDAM. Conclusions. Thanks to automation of the less-creative
steps in SRs, our methodology allows researchers to skip the tedious tasks of
keywording and manually classifying primary studies, thus freeing effort for
the analysis and the discussion.

systems. These include neural activity in which evidence for scale freeness has
been reported using a range of imaging modalities. Here, we derive the ways in
which connections within a network must transform - relative to system size -
in order to maintain scale freeness and test these theoretical transformations
via simulations. First, we explore the known invariance of planetary motion for
orbits varying in size. Using parametric empirical Bayesian modelling and a
generic dynamical systems model, we show that we recover Kepler's third law
from orbital timeseries, using our proposed transformations; thereby providing
construct validation. We then demonstrate that the dynamical critical exponent
is inversely proportional to the time rescaling exponent, in the context of
coarse graining operations. Using murine calcium imaging data, we then show
that the dynamical critical exponent can be estimated in an empirical
biological setting. Specifically, we compare dynamical critical exponents -
associated with spontaneous and task states in two regions of imaged cortex -
that are classified as task-relevant and task-irrelevant. We find, consistently
across animals, that the task-irrelevant region exhibits higher dynamical
critical exponents during spontaneous activity than during task performance.
Conversely, the task-relevant region is associated with higher dynamical
critical exponents in task vs. spontaneous states. These data support the idea
that higher dynamical critical exponents, within relevant cortical structures,
underwrite neuronal processing due to the implicit increase in cross-scale
information transmission.

constraints on the nature of the compact object at the centre of the Milky Way.
The presence of a black hole in that region is well established, but its
neighboring environment is still an open debate. In that respect, the existence
of dark matter in that central region may be detectable due to its strong
signatures on the orbits of stars: the main effect is a Newtonian precession
which will affect the overall pericentre shift of S2, the latter being a target
measurement of the GRAVITY instrument. The exact nature of this dark matter
(e.g., stellar dark remnants or diffuse dark matter) is unknown. This article
assumes it to be an scalar field of toroidal distribution, associated with
ultra-light dark matter particles, surrounding the Kerr black hole. Such a
field is a form of ""hair"" expected in the context of superradiance, a mechanism
that extracts rotational energy from the black hole. Orbital signatures for the
S2 star are computed and shown to be detectable by GRAVITY. The scalar field
can be constrained because the variation of orbital elements depends both on
the relative mass of the scalar field to the black hole and on the field mass
coupling parameter.

programs have non-positive curvature, a notion that we introduce and study here
for precubical sets, and can be thought of as an algebraic analogue of the
well-known one for metric spaces. Using this it, as well as categorical
rewriting techniques, we are then able to show that directed and non-directed
homotopy coincide for directed paths in these precubical sets. Finally, we
study the geometric realization of precubical sets in metric spaces, to show
that our conditions on precubical sets actually coincide with those for metric
spaces. Since the category of metric spaces is not cocomplete, we are lead to
work with generalized metric spaces and study some of their properties.

segmentation (OSVOS) has achieved a large margin compared to the conventional
optical-flow based methods regarding to the segmentation accuracy. Its
excellent performance mainly benefit from the three-step training mechanism,
that are: (1) acquiring object features on the base dataset (i.e. ImageNet),
(2) training the parent network on the training set of the target dataset (i.e.
DAVIS-2016) to be capable of differentiating the object of interest from the
background. (3) online fine-tuning the interested object on the first frame of
the target test set to overfit its appearance, then the model can be utilized
to segment the same object in the rest frames of that video. In this paper, we
argue that for the step (2), OSVOS has the limitation to 'overemphasize' the
generic semantic object information while 'dilute' the instance cues of the
object(s), which largely block the whole training process. Through adding a
common module, video loss, which we formulate with various forms of constraints
(including weighted BCE loss, high-dimensional triplet loss, as well as a novel
mixed instance-aware video loss), to train the parent network in the step (2),
the network is then better prepared for the step (3), i.e. online fine-tuning
on the target instance. Through extensive experiments using different network
structures as the backbone, we show that the proposed video loss module can
improve the segmentation performance significantly, compared to that of OSVOS.
Meanwhile, since video loss is a common module, it can be generalized to other
fine-tuning based methods and similar vision tasks such as depth estimation and
saliency detection.

define a likelihood for an exoplanet to retain its atmosphere. This function
can be incorporated into the new habitability index SEPHI. Using different
formulations in the literature in addition to stellar and exoplanet physical
characteristics, we estimated the stellar magnetic induction, the main
characteristics of the stellar wind, and the different star-planet interaction
regions (sub- and super-Alfv\'enic, sub- and supersonic). With this
information, we can estimate the radius of the exoplanet magnetopause and thus
the exoplanet unprotected surface. We have conducted a study of the auroral
aperture angles for Earth-like exoplanets orbiting the habitable zone of its
star, and found different behaviors depending on whether the star is in
rotational saturated or unsaturated regimes, with angles of aperture of the
auroral ring above or below 36^\circ, respectively, and with different slopes
for the linear relation between the auroral aperture angle at the inner edge of
the habitable zone versus the difference between auroral aperture angles at the
two boundaries of the habitable zone. When the planet is tidally locked, the
unprotected angle increases dramatically to values higher than 40^\circ with a
low likelihood of keeping its atmosphere. When the impact of stellar wind is
produced in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime, the likelihood of keeping the atmosphere
is almost zero for exoplanets orbiting very close to their star.

Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). In this contribution, the optimized
strategies developed specifically for the prompt follow-up of gravitational

during Observation Run O2 on the binary black hole (BH-BH) merger GW170814 and

for the gravitational waves follow-up program with H.E.S.S. will be provided.

the Shuffle phase, coded multicasting opportunities are exploited thanks to the
repetitive file allocation among different nodes. Based on this scheme, we
further propose the computation-aware and the shuffle-aware function

signal processing, resonances, and fluid stability. Similarly, spectral
decompositions (pure point, absolutely continuous and singular continuous)

general method able to compute spectral measures or spectral decompositions of
infinite-dimensional normal operators. Previous efforts focus on specific
examples where analytical formulae are available (or perturbations thereof) or
on classes of operators with a lot of structure. Hence the general
computational problem is predominantly open. We solve this problem by providing
the first set of general algorithms that compute spectral measures and
decompositions of a wide class of operators. Given a matrix representation of a
self-adjoint or unitary operator, such that each column decays at infinity at a
known asymptotic rate, we show how to compute spectral measures and
decompositions. We discuss how these methods allow the computation of objects
such as the functional calculus, and how they generalise to a large class of
partial differential operators, allowing, for example, solutions to evolution
PDEs such as Schr\""odinger equations on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Computational
spectral problems in infinite dimensions have led to the SCI hierarchy, which
classifies the difficulty of computational problems. We classify computation of
measures, measure decompositions, types of spectra, functional calculus, and
Radon--Nikodym derivatives in the SCI hierarchy. The new algorithms are
demonstrated to be efficient on examples taken from OPs on the real line and
the unit circle (e.g. giving computational realisations of Favard's theorem and
Verblunsky's theorem), and are applied to evolution equations on a 2D

called bin packing with clustering, and online bin packing with delays. A bin
packing input consists of items of sizes not larger than 1, and the goal is to
partition or pack them into bins, where the total size of items of every valid
bin cannot exceed 1.
  In bin packing with clustering, items also have colors associated with them.
A globally optimal solution can combine items of different colors in bins,
while a clustered solution can only pack monochromatic bins. The goal is to
compare a globally optimal solution to an optimal clustered solution, under
certain constraints on the coloring provided with the input. We show close
bounds on the worst-case ratio between these two costs, called ""the price of
clustering"", improving and simplifying previous results. Specifically, we show
that the price of clustering does not exceed 1.93667, improving over the
previous upper bound of 1.951, and that it is at least 1.93558, improving over
the previous lower bound of 1.93344.
  In online bin packing with delays, items are presented over time. Items may
wait to be packed, and an algorithm can create a new bin at any time, packing a
subset of already existing unpacked items into it, under the condition that the
bin is valid. A created bin cannot be used again in the future, and all items
have to be packed into bins eventually. The objective is to minimize the number
of used bins plus the sum of waiting costs of all items, called delays. We
build on previous work and modify a simple phase-based algorithm. We combine
the modification with a careful analysis to improve the previously known
competitive ratio from 3.951 to below 3.1551.

proximity field. Such moir\'e modulated magnetic proximity effect manifests as
a miniband spin splitting that strongly depends on the moir\'e periodicity

point of view: freezing cellular automata where the state of a cell can only
decrease according to some order on states, cellular automata where each cell
only makes a bounded number of state changes in any orbit, and finally cellular
automata where each orbit converges to some fixed point. Many examples studied
in the literature fit into these definitions, in particular the works on
cristal growth started by S. Ulam in the 60s. The central question addressed
here is how the computational power and computational hardness of basic
properties is affected by the constraints of convergence, bounded number of
change, or local decreasing of states in each cell. By studying various
benchmark problems (short-term prediction, long term reachability, limits) and
considering various complexity measures and scales (LOGSPACE vs. PTIME,
communication complexity, Turing computability and arithmetical hierarchy) we
give a rich and nuanced answer: the overall computational complexity of such
cellular automata depends on the class considered (among the three above), the
dimension, and the precise problem studied. In particular, we show that all
settings can achieve universality in the sense of Blondel-Delvenne-K\r{u}rka,
although short term predictability varies from NLOGSPACE to P-complete.
Besides, the computability of limit configurations starting from computable
initial configurations separates bounded-change from convergent cellular
automata in dimension~1, but also dimension~1 versus higher dimensions for
freezing cellular automata. Another surprising dimension-sensitive result
obtained is that nilpotency becomes decidable in dimension~ 1 for all the three
classes, while it stays undecidable even for freezing cellular automata in
higher dimension.

models the distribution of these channel images using Deep Convolutional
Generative Adversarial Networks. Moreover, for the measurements with different
user speeds, the user speed is considered as an auxiliary parameter for the

Furthermore, to capture 2D similarity in both time and frequency, a new metric

differences between the Lorenz curve of the hypothetical income distribution

combines the transformed parameters of the Lorenz curve through a time series

introduced into the originally nuisance Dirichlet precision parameter to take
into account the variability from the sampling. From the simulated data and
real data on the Japanese monthly income survey, it is confirmed that the

properties and constrain stellar evolution models. In particular, it is
possible to measure at the percent level masses and radii of both components of
a double-lined spectroscopic EB. Since the advent of high-precision photometric
space missions (MOST, CoRoT, Kepler, BRITE, TESS), the use of stellar pulsation
properties to infer stellar interiors and dynamics constitutes a revolution for
low-mass star studies. The Kepler mission has led to the discovery of thousands
of classical pulsators such as $\delta$ Scuti and solar-like oscillators (main
sequence and evolved), but also almost 3000 EBs with orbital periods shorter
than 1100 days. We report the first systematic search for stellar pulsators in
the entire Kepler eclipsing binary catalog. The focus is mainly aimed at
discovering $\delta$ Scuti, $\gamma$ Doradus, red giant, and tidally excited
pulsators. We developed a data inspection tool (DIT) that automatically
produces a series of plots from the Kepler light-curves that allows us to
visually identify whether stellar oscillations are present in a given time
series. We applied the DIT to the whole Kepler eclipsing binary database and
identified 303 systems whose light curves display oscillations, including 163
new discoveries. A total of 149 stars are flagged as $\delta$ Scuti (100 from
this paper), 115 stars as $\gamma$ Doradus (69 new), 85 stars as red giants (27
new), 59 as tidally excited oscillators (29 new). There is some overlap among
these groups, as some display several types of oscillations. Despite many of
these systems are likely to be false positives, i. e., when an EB light curve
is blended with a pulsator, this catalog gathers a vast sample of systems that
are valuable for a better understanding of stellar evolution.

characterised by the up-rise of their fluxes in bluer wavelengths, typically in
the 1,200-2,500A range. This work aims at estimating the rate of occurrence of
the UV upturn over the entire red-sequence population of galaxies that show
significant UV emission. This assessment is made considering it as function of
three parameters: redshift, stellar mass, and -- what may seem
counter-intuitive at first -- emission-line classification. We built a
multiwavelength spectro-photometric catalogue from the Galaxy Mass Assembly
survey, together with aperture-matched data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer
Medium-Depth Imaging Survey (MIS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, covering the
redshift range between 0.06 and 0.40. From this sample, we analyse the UV
emission among UV bright galaxies, by selecting those that occupy the
red-sequence locus in the (NUV-r) x (FUV-NUV) chart; then, we stratify the
sample by their emission-line classes. To that end, we make use of
emission-line diagnostic diagrams, focusing the analysis in retired/passive
lineless galaxies. Then, a Bayesian logistic model was built to simultaneously
deal with the effects of all galaxy properties (including emission-line
classification or lack thereof). The main results show that retired/passive
systems host an up-rise in the fraction of UV upturn or redshifts between 0.06
and 0.25, followed by an in-fall up to 0.35. Additionally, we show that the
fraction of UV upturn hosts rises with increasing stellar mass.

(Extended RSDFO), a novel population-based stochastic optimization algorithm on
Riemannian manifolds that addresses the locality and implicit assumptions of
manifold optimization in the literature.
  We begin by investigating the Information Geometrical structure of
statistical model over Riemannian manifolds. This establishes a geometrical
framework of Extended RSDFO using both the statistical geometry of the decision
space and the Riemannian geometry of the search space. We construct locally
inherited probability distribution via an orientation-preserving diffeomorphic
bundle morphism, and then extend the information geometrical structure to
mixture densities over totally bounded subsets of manifolds. The former relates
the information geometry of the decision space and the local point estimations
on the search space manifold. The latter overcomes the locality of parametric
probability distributions on Riemannian manifolds.
  We then construct Extended RSDFO and study its structure and properties from
a geometrical perspective. We show that Extended RSDFO's expected fitness
improves monotonically and it's global eventual convergence in finitely many
steps on connected compact Riemannian manifolds.
  Extended RSDFO is compared to state-of-the-art manifold optimization
algorithms on multi-modal optimization problems over a variety of manifolds.
  In particular, we perform a novel synthetic experiment on Jacob's ladder to
motivate and necessitate manifold optimization. Jacob's ladder is a non-compact
manifold of countably infinite genus, which cannot be expressed as polynomial
constraints and does not have a global representation in an ambient Euclidean
space. Optimization problems on Jacob's ladder thus cannot be addressed by
traditional (constraint) optimization methods on Euclidean spaces.

images to be consistent with the measured projection data, while the unmeasured
information is complemented by learning based methods. For this purpose, a data
consistent artifact reduction (DCAR) method is introduced: First, a prior image
is generated from an initial limited angle reconstruction via deep learning as
a substitute for missing information. Afterwards, a conventional iterative
reconstruction algorithm is applied, integrating the data consistency in the
measured angular range and the prior information in the missing angular range.
This ensures data integrity in the measured area, while inaccuracies
incorporated by the deep learning prior lie only in areas where no information
is acquired. The proposed DCAR method achieves significant image quality
improvement: for 120-degree cone-beam limited angle tomography more than 10%
RMSE reduction in noise-free case and more than 24% RMSE reduction in noisy
case compared with a state-of-the-art U-Net based method.

Vertex Cover Track. The minimum vertex cover problem is one of a handful of
problems for which kernelization---the repeated reducing of the input size via
data reduction rules---is known to be highly effective in practice. Our
algorithm uses a portfolio of techniques, including an aggressive kernelization
strategy, local search, branch-and-reduce, and a state-of-the-art
branch-and-bound solver. Of particular interest is that several of our
techniques were not from the literature on the vertex over problem: they were
originally published to solve the (complementary) maximum independent set and
maximum clique problems.
  Aside from illustrating our solver's performance in the PACE 2019
Implementation Challenge, our experiments provide several key insights not yet
seen before in the literature. First, kernelization can boost the performance
of branch-and-bound clique solvers enough to outperform branch-and-reduce
solvers. Second, local search can significantly boost the performance of
branch-and-reduce solvers. And finally, somewhat surprisingly, kernelization
can sometimes make branch-and-bound algorithms perform worse than running
branch-and-bound alone.

Shortest Path Search Algorithm Based on Pruning by Shortest Path Trees, to

fast all-pairs shortest path algorithm for weighted graph based on the same
idea. In Dijkstra algorithm which is said to be fast in weighted graphs, the
average number of accesses to adjacent vertices (expressed by {\alpha}) is
about equal to the average degree of the graph. On the other hand, our
algorithm utilizes the shortest path trees of adjacent vertices of each source
vertex in the same manner as the algorithm for unweighted graphs, and reduce
{\alpha} drastically in comparison with Dijkstra algorithm. Roughly speaking
{\alpha} is reduced to the value close to 1, because the average degree of a
tree is about 2, and one is used to come in and the other is used to go out,
although that does not hold true when the depth of the short path trees is
small. In case of weighted graphs, a problem which does not occur in unweighted
graphs occurs. It is waiting for the generation of the shortest path tree of an
adjacent vertex. Therefore, it is possible that a deadlock occurs. We prove our
algorithm is deadlock-free. We compared our algorithm with Dijkstra and Peng
algorithms. On Dijkstra algorithm ours outperforms it on speed and {\alpha}
except that Dijkstra algorithm slightly outperforms ours or they are almost the
same on CPU time in sparse scale-free graphs. The result on Peng algorithm is
as follows: In speed and {\alpha}, ours outperforms Peng algorithm in
hypercube-shaped and dense scale-free graphs, but conversely Peng algorithm
outperforms ours in sparse scale-free graphs.

developed a radiation hydrodynamics model describing an accretion column

radiative losses and absorption of radiation by matter in the non local

from the slab is absorbed by the pre-shock accreting material. As a result, the
pre-shock accretion column gradually heats up to temperatures of $10^5$ K,
forming a radiative precursor of the shock. The precursor has a thermal
structure with the hottest part at $T \approx 10^5$ K, with size comparable to
that of the hot slab, above the post-shock region. At larger distances the

one-dimensional potential well as working substance. The cycle comprises of two
isothermal processes and two potential well processes of equal width, which
forms the quantum counterpart of the known isochoric process in classical
nature. For a concrete interpretation about the relation between the quantum
observables with the physically measurable parameters (like the efficiency and
work done), we develop a link between the thermodynamic variables and the
uncertainty relation. We have used this model to explore the work extraction
and the efficiency of the heat engine for a relativistic case from the
standpoint of uncertainty relation, where the incompatible observables are the
position and the momentum operators. We are able to determine the bounds (the
upper and the lower bounds) of the efficiency of the heat engine through the
thermal uncertainty relation.

dialogue system which consists of two modules. One is the knowledge graph (KG)
constructor organizing the personal information for each loan applicant. The
other is structured dialogue management that can dynamically generate a series
of questions based on the personal KG to ask the applicants and determine their
identity states. We also present a heuristic user simulator based on problem
analysis to evaluate our method. Experiments have shown that the trainable
dialogue system can effectively detect fraudsters, and achieve higher
recognition accuracy compared with rule-based systems. Furthermore, our learned
dialogue strategies are interpretable and flexible, which can help promote
real-world applications.

potential game arenas to include the edge-periodic graphs. These are graphs
with an infinite lifetime comprised of discrete time steps such that each edge
$e$ is assigned a bit pattern of length $l_e$, with a 1 in the $i$-th position
of the pattern indicating the presence of edge $e$ in the $i$-th step of each
consecutive block of $l_e$ steps. Utilising the already-developed framework of
reachability games, we extend existing techniques to obtain, amongst other
results, an $O(\textsf{LCM}(L)\cdot n^3)$ upper bound on the time required to
decide if a given $n$-vertex edge-periodic graph $G^\tau$ is cop or robber win

intense and rapid star formation episode, which lasts until the onset of a
galactic wind, powered by the thermal energy injected by stellar winds and
supernova explosions. Our models follow the evolution of several chemical
elements (C, N, $\alpha$-elements and Fe) both in the gas and dust phases. %The
most recent stellar yield and dust prescriptions are adopted. We test different
values of $\beta$, the slope of the embedded cluster mass function for the
IGIMF, where lower $\beta$ values imply a more top-heavy initial mass function
(IMF). The computed abundances are compared to high-quality abundance
measurements obtained in lensed galaxies and from composite spectra in large
samples of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range $2 \lesssim z \lesssim
3$. The adoption of the IGIMF causes a sensible increase of the rate of star
formation with respect to a standard Salpeter IMF, with a strong impact on
chemical evolution. We find that in order to reproduce the observed abundance
patterns in these galaxies, either we need a very top-heavy IGIMF ($\beta < 2$)
or large amounts of dust. In particular, if dust is important, the IGIMF should
have $\beta \ge 2$, which means an IMF slightly more top-heavy than the
Salpeter one. The evolution of the dust mass with time for galaxies of
different mass and IMF is also computed, highlighting that the dust amount
increases with a top-heavier IGIMF.

To determine whether a thick atmosphere has survived on a small planet, one
approach is to search for signatures of atmospheric heat redistribution in its
thermal phase curve. Previous phase curve observations of the super-Earth 55
Cancri e (1.9 Earth radii) showed that its peak brightness is offset from the
substellar point $-$ possibly indicative of atmospheric circulation. Here we

observed phase variation is symmetric and has a large amplitude, implying a
dayside brightness temperature of $1040\pm40$ kelvin and a nightside
temperature consistent with zero kelvin (at one standard deviation). Thick
atmospheres with surface pressures above 10 bar are ruled out by the data (at
three standard deviations), and less-massive atmospheres are unstable to
erosion by stellar wind. The data are well fitted by a bare rock model with a
low Bond albedo (lower than 0.2 at two standard deviations). These results
support theoretical predictions that hot terrestrial planets orbiting small

are widely used for modelling features commonly found in observed financial

interest for market risk management. For the simplest GARCH(p,q) process, with
max(p,q) = 1, all extremal features have been fully characterised. Although the
marginal features of extreme values of the process have been theoretically
characterised when max(p, q) >= 2, much remains to be found about both marginal
and dependence structure during extreme excursions. Specifically, a reliable
method is required for evaluating the tail index, which regulates the marginal
tail behaviour and there is a need for methods and algorithms for determining
clustering. In particular, for the latter, the mean number of extreme values in
a short-term cluster, i.e., the reciprocal of the extremal index, has only been
characterised in special cases which exclude all GARCH(p,q) processes that are

regular variation property of stationary GARCH(p,q) processes, currently there
are no reliable methods for numerically evaluating key components of these

for fence removal and image reconstruction using conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (cGANs). These networks have been successfully applied in
several domains of Computer Vision focusing on image generation and rendering.
Our initial approach is based on a two-stage architecture involving two cGANs
that generate the fence mask and the inpainted image, respectively. Training of
these networks is carried out independently and, during evaluation, the input
image is passed through the two generators in succession to obtain the
de-fenced image. The results obtained from this approach are satisfactory, but
the response time is long since the image has to pass through two sets of
convolution layers. To reduce the response time, we propose a second approach
involving only a single cGAN architecture that is trained using the
ground-truth of fenced de-fenced image pairs along with the edge map of the
fenced image produced by the Canny Filter. Incorporation of the edge map helps
the network to precisely detect the edges present in the input image, and also
imparts it an ability to carry out high quality de-fencing in an efficient
manner, even in the presence of a fewer number of layers as compared to the
two-stage network. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results reported
in the manuscript reveal that the de-fenced images generated by the
single-stage de-fencing network have similar visual quality to those produced
by the two-stage network. Comparative performance analysis also emphasizes the
effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art image de-fencing

Derived from quantum waves immersed in an \emph{Abelian} gauge, the
quasiperiodic Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model is a simple yet powerful
Hamiltonian to study the Anderson localization of ultracold atoms. In this
work, we investigate the localization properties of ultracold atoms trapped in
quasiperiodic optical lattices subject to a non-Abelian gauge, which can be
depicted by a family of non-Abelian AAH models. We identify that the
non-Abelian AAH models can bear the self-duality under the Fourier
transformation. We thus analyze the localization transition of this self-dual
non-Abelian quasiperiodic optical lattices, revealing that the non-Abelian
gauge involved drives a transition from a pure delocalization phase, then to
coexistence phases, and then finally to a pure localization phase. This is in
stark contrast to the Abelian AAH model that does not support the coexistence
phases. Our results thus comprise a new insight on the fundamental aspects of
Anderson localization in quasiperiodic systems, from the perspective of
non-Abelian gauge.

on a dedicated hardware, the Camera Test Setup (CTS). For each camera pixel,
the CTS is equipped with two LEDs, one operated in pulsed mode to reproduce

introduces a leveled and iterative measurement approach that accurately
captures the latencies at all levels of the HW/SW stack in spite of the

in statistical thermodynamics to describe phase transitions may provide new
insights to emerging behavior of biological systems. Here we will
systematically evaluate the translation of computational techniques from
solid-state physics to network models that closely resemble biological networks
and develop specific translational rules to tackle problems unique to living

network node. Motivated by the apparent asymmetry between biological states
where an entity exhibits boolean states i.e. is active or inactive, we present
an adaptation of symmetric Ising model towards an asymmetric one fitting to

mean-field solution of modified Ising model of a network type that closely

Ising models with external field and undergoes a discontinuous phase transition
of the first-order and exhibits hysteresis. The simulation setup presented here

Analysis, Vol. 50, 2012]. Because of the global Lipschitz assumption utilized
in [Anderson, SIAM Numerical Analysis, Vol. 50, 2012], the main result there is
only applicable to a small percentage of the models found in the literature,
and it was conjectured that similar results should hold for a much wider class
of models. In this paper we demonstrate this conjecture to be true by proving
the variance of the coupled processes scales in the desired manner for a large
class of non-Lipschitz models. We further extend the analysis to allow for time
dependence in the parameters. In particular, binary systems with or without
time-dependent rate parameters, a class of models that accounts for the vast
majority of systems considered in the literature, satisfy the assumptions of
our theory.

domains, and its new applications are ubiquitous. The question of neural
network design thus increases in importance, as traditional empirical
approaches are reaching their limits. Manual design of network architectures
from scratch relies heavily on trial and error, while using existing pretrained
models can introduce redundancies or vulnerabilities. Automated neural
architecture design is able to overcome these problems, but the most successful
algorithms operate on significantly constrained design spaces, assuming the
target network to consist of identical repeating blocks. While such approach
allows for faster search, it does so at the cost of expressivity. We instead
propose an alternative probabilistic representation of a whole neural network
structure under the assumption of independence between layer types. Our matrix
of probabilities is equivalent to the population of models, but allows for
discovery of structural irregularities, while being simple to interpret and
analyze. We construct an architecture search algorithm, inspired by the
estimation of distribution algorithms, to take advantage of this
representation. The probability matrix is tuned towards generating
high-performance models by repeatedly sampling the architectures and evaluating
the corresponding networks, while gradually increasing the model depth. Our
algorithm is shown to discover non-regular models which cannot be expressed via
blocks, but are competitive both in accuracy and computational cost, while not
utilizing complex dataflows or advanced training techniques, as well as
remaining conceptually simple and highly extensible.

well as for detection of air-showers induced by high-energy cosmic rays and
neutrinos. Since the radio emission from air-showers forms short broadband
pulses with duration of tens nanoseconds, the data acquisition strategies of
cosmic-ray and astronomical arrays have significant differences. To perform
precise measurement of cosmic rays, the radio array should have absolute
amplitude calibration and record the entire electric field on the antenna in
the broad frequency range. These requirements are similar to ones defined for
the experiments aimed at the detection of weak signal from neutral hydrogen at
redshifts of $z$>10, what led us to the application of our experience with
Tunka-Rex to this problem. We are developing new experimental setup comprising
of four antenna stations, placed on the area of 100 sq.m. Each antenna station
consists of two perpendicular loop antennas measuring electric field in the
frequency band of 30-80 MHz. The setup records electric fields from all
antennas in portions of 50 $\mu$s reaching the spectral resolution of 20 kHz.
We expect a flow of redundant data of about 10 GB/day, and plan to exploit this
redundancy in order to decrease systematic uncertainty of the measurements by
application of digital beam-forming, matched filtering and RFI suppression with
neural networks. In the present contribution we describe the design and
calibration of the setup, expected performance and data analysis techniques.

the SED field prevented the electron orbit from collapsing into the proton but

used to obtain the quantum mechanical results, and the Abraham-Lorentz

for image classification. The classical method of training CNNs is by labeling
images in a supervised manner as in ""input image belongs to this label""
(Positive Learning; PL), which is a fast and accurate method if the labels are
assigned correctly to all images. However, if inaccurate labels, or noisy

complementary label are low, NL decreases the risk of providing incorrect

adopting PL selectively, termed as Selective Negative Learning and Positive

superior performance of filtering out noisy data. With simple semi-supervised

cost and fast query speed. Zero-shot hashing (ZSH) aims to learn a hashing
model that is trained using only samples from seen categories, but can
generalize well to samples of unseen categories. ZSH generally uses category
attributes to seek a semantic embedding space to transfer knowledge from seen
categories to unseen ones. As a result, it may perform poorly when labeled data
are insufficient. ZSH methods are mainly designed for single-modality data,
which prevents their application to the widely spread multi-modal data. On the
other hand, existing cross-modal hashing solutions assume that all the
modalities share the same category labels, while in practice the labels of
different data modalities may be different. To address these issues, we propose
a general Cross-modal Zero-shot Hashing (CZHash) solution to effectively
leverage unlabeled and labeled multi-modality data with different label spaces.
CZHash first quantifies the composite similarity between instances using label
and feature information. It then defines an objective function to achieve deep
feature learning compatible with the composite similarity preserving, category
attribute space learning, and hashing coding function learning. CZHash further
introduces an alternative optimization procedure to jointly optimize these
learning objectives. Experiments on benchmark multi-modal datasets show that
CZHash significantly outperforms related representative hashing approaches both
on effectiveness and adaptability.

AE transceiver block in two separate chips and linking them by a single AER

complex K into a new 2-complex K^ such that every vertex in the 1-skeleton G^

followed to print all edges in a continuous fashion. We start with a mesh K of
the union of polygons obtained by projecting all layers to the plane. We
compute its Euler transformation K^. In the slicing step, we clip K^ at each
layer using its polygon to obtain a complex that may not necessarily be Euler.
We then patch this complex by adding edges such that any odd-degree nodes
created by slicing are transformed to have even degrees again. We print extra
support edges in place of any segments left out to ensure there are no edges
without support in the next layer. These support edges maintain the Euler
nature of the complex. Finally we describe a tree-based search algorithm that

and length scales, the often-praised Dual-Phase-Lag (DPL) model was conceived,
introducing a causality relation between the onset of heat flux and the
temperature gradient. The most prominent aspect of the first-order DPL model is
the prediction of wave-like temperature propagation, the detection of which
still remains elusive. Among the challenges to make further progress is the
capability to disentangle the intertwining of the parameters affecting
wave-like behaviour. This work contributes to the quest, providing a
straightforward, easy-to-adopt, analytical mean to inspect the optimal
conditions to observe temperature wave oscillations. The complex-valued
dispersion relation for the temperature scalar field is investigated for the
case of a localised temperature pulse in space, and for the case of a forced
temperature oscillation in time. A modal quality factor is introduced showing
that, for the case of the temperature gradient preceding the heat flux, the
material acts as a bandpass filter for the temperature wave. The bandpass
filter characteristics are accessed in terms of the relevant delay times
entering the DPL model. The optimal region in parameters space is discussed in
a variety of systems, covering nine and twelve decades in space and time-scale
respectively. The here presented approach is of interest for the design of
nanoscale thermal devices operating on ultra-fast and ultra-short time scales,
a scenario here addressed for the case of quantum materials and graphite.
