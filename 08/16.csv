representing a single Fourier mode, into a round jet flow allows the
measurement of the downstream generation and development of higher harmonic
spectral components and to measure when these components are eventually
absorbed into fully developed turbulence. Furthermore, the dynamic evolution of
the measured power spectra observed corresponds well to the measured cascaded
delays reported by others. Closely matching spectral development and cascade
delays have also been derived directly from a one-dimensional solution of the
Navier-Stokes equation described in a companion paper. The results in the
current work provide vital information about how initial conditions influence
development of the shape of the spectrum and about the extent of the time
scales in the triad interaction process, which should be of significance to

In this paper, we aim to optimize multi-sequence MR image recovery from

the difference in acquisition time for various sequences. We first formulate it
as a constrained optimization problem and then show that finding the optimal
sampling strategy for all sequences and the best recovery model at the same

problem, we propose a blind recovery model that simultaneously recovers
multiple sequences, and an efficient approach to find proper combination of

decide the undersampling strategy for sequences within an overall time budget.

population of 166 stars with initial masses of ~25Msun to ~50Msun, with more
massive stars already lost to supernova. The stellar population follows a
smooth and continuous morphological sequence from late-O giant through to OB
supergiant. Subsequently, the progression bifurcates, with one branch yielding
mid- to late-B hypergiants and cool super-/hypergiants, and the other massive
blue stragglers, prior to a diverse population of H-depleted Wolf-Rayets. A
substantial population of O-type stars with anomalously broad Paschen series
lines are seen, a property which we attribute to binarity. Binary interaction
is clearly required to yield the uniquely rich cohort of hypergiants, which
includes both mass-stripped primaries and rejuvenated secondaries/stellar

large fraction of metal-poor halo stars, with abundances relative to iron (Fe)

a factor of 3 in younger Galactic disc stars. The large scatter of r-process
elements in the early Galaxy suggests that the r-process is made by rare
events, like compact binary mergers and rare sub-classes of supernovae.
Although being rare, neutron star mergers alone have difficulties to explain
the observed enhancement of r-process elements in the lowest metallicity stars
compared to Fe. The supernovae producing the two neutron stars already provide
a substantial Fe abundance where the r-process ejecta from the merger would be
injected. In this work we investigate another complementary scenario, where the
r-process occurs in neutron star-black hole mergers in addition to neutron star
mergers. Neutron star-black hole mergers would eject similar amounts of
r-process matter as neutron star mergers, but only the neutron star progenitor
would have produced Fe. Furthermore, a reduced efficiency of Fe production from
single stars significantly alters the age-metallicity relation, which shifts
the onset of r-process production to lower metallicities. We use the
high-resolution [(20 pc)3/cell] inhomogeneous chemical evolution tool `ICE' to
study the outcomes of these effects. In our simulations, an adequate
combination of neutron star mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers

model development, and 5,379 CFIs of 625 eyes from the Age-Related Eye Disease
Study (AREDS) for analysis of GA growth rate. Methods: A deep learning model
based on an ensemble of encoder-decoder architectures was implemented and
optimized for the segmentation of GA in CFIs. Four experienced graders
delineated GA in CFIs from RS and BMES. These manual delineations were used to
evaluate the segmentation model using 5-fold cross-validation. The model was
further applied to CFIs from the AREDS to study the growth rate of GA. Linear
regression analysis was used to study associations between structural
biomarkers at baseline and GA growth rate. A general estimate of the
progression of GA area over time was made by combining growth rates of all eyes
with GA from the AREDS set. Results: The model obtained an average Dice
coefficient of 0.72 $\pm$ 0.26 on the BMES and RS. An intraclass correlation
coefficient of 0.83 was reached between the automatically estimated GA area and
the graders' consensus measures. Eight automatically calculated structural
biomarkers (area, filled area, convex area, convex solidity, eccentricity,
roundness, foveal involvement and perimeter) were significantly associated with
growth rate. Combining all growth rates indicated that GA area grows
quadratically up to an area of around 12 mm$^{2}$, after which growth rate
stabilizes or decreases. Conclusion: The presented deep learning model allowed
for fully automatic and robust segmentation of GA in CFIs. These segmentations
can be used to extract structural characteristics of GA that predict its growth

substantial scientific interest to study how brain connectivity varies over

interconnections among brain regions. We propose a symmetric bilinear logistic
regression to learn a set of small subgraphs relevant to a binary outcome from
longitudinal brain networks as well as estimating the time effects of the
subgraphs. We enforce the extracted signal subgraphs to have clique structure
which has appealing interpretations as they can be related to neurological
circuits. The time effect of each signal subgraph reflects how its predictive
effect on the outcome varies over time, which may improve our understanding of
interactions between the aging of brain structure and neurological disorders.
Application of this method on longitudinal brain connectomics and cognitive

characterize quantum states by performing an efficient partial tomography to
estimate observables corresponding to $k$-body reduced density matrices

chemistry usually require that one measure the fermionic 2-RDM. While such
marginals provide a tractable description of quantum states from which many
important properties can be computed, their determination often requires a
prohibitively large number of circuit repetitions. Here we describe a method by
which all elements of $k$-body qubit RDMs acting on $N$ qubits can be directly
measured with a number of circuits scaling as ${\cal O}(3^{k} \log^{k-1}\! N)$,
an exponential improvement in $N$ over prior art. Next, we show that if one is
able to implement a linear depth circuit on a linear array prior to
measurement, then one can directly measure all elements of the fermionic 2-RDM
using only ${\cal O}(N^2)$ circuits. We prove that this result is
asymptotically optimal, thus establishing an exponential separation between the
number of circuits required to directly measure all elements of qubit versus
fermion RDMs. We further demonstrate a technique to estimate the expectation
value of any linear combination of fermionic 2-RDM elements using ${\cal O}(N^4

greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, several existing proposals state the idea to
control the by the transportation sector caused GHG emissions through an
Emission Trading Systems (ETS). However, most existing approaches integrate GHG
emissions through the fuel consumption and car registration, limiting the
tracing of emissions in more complex modes e.g. shared vehicles, shared rides
and even public transportation. This paper presents a new design of a
user-centric ETS and its implementation as a carbon Blockchain framework for
Smart Mobility Data-market (cBSMD). The cBSMD allows for the seamless
transactions of token-equivalent GHG emissions when realizing a trip, or an
emission trading action as well as the transaction of individual, service or
system-wide emission performance data. We demonstrate an instance of the cBSMD
implementation for the transactions of an ETS where all travellers receive a
certain amount of emission credits in the form of tokens, linked to the GHG
price and a total emission cap. Travellers use their tokens each time they emit
GHG when travelling in a multi-modal network, purchase tokens for a given trip
when they have an insufficient token amount or sell when having a surplus of
tokens due to a lower amount of emitted GHG. This instance of cBSMD is then
applied to a case-study of 24hours of mobility of 3,186 travellers from
Oakville, Ontario, Canada, where we showcase different cBSMD transactions and
analyze token usage and emission performance.

overwhelming transdisciplinary interest in recent years. Topological edge
states, for instance, have been realized in versatile systems including
electromagnetic-waves. Typically, topological properties are revealed in
momentum space, using concepts such as Chern number and Berry phase. Here, we
demonstrate a universal mapping of the topology of Dirac-like cones from
momentum space to real space. We evince the mapping by exciting the cones in
photonic honeycomb (pseudospin-1/2) and Lieb (pseudospin-1) lattices with
vortex beams of topological charge l, optimally aligned for a chosen pseudospin
state s, leading to direct observation of topological charge conversion that
follows the rule of l to l+2s. The mapping is theoretically accounted for all
initial excitation conditions with the pseudospin-orbit interaction and
nontrivial Berry phases. Surprisingly, such a mapping exists even in a deformed
lattice where the total angular momentum is not conserved, unveiling its
topological origin. The universality of the mapping extends beyond the photonic
platform and 2D lattices: equivalent topological conversion occurs for 3D
Dirac-Weyl synthetic magnetic monopoles, which could be realized in ultracold
atomic gases and responsible for mechanism behind the vortex creation in
electron beams traversing a magnetic monopole field.

However, many astrophysically important effects are dissipative. The
consequences of incorporating such forces into otherwise symplectic schemes is
not always clear. We show that moving to a general framework of non-commutative
operators (dissipative or not) clarifies many of these questions, and that
several important properties of symplectic schemes carry over to the general

exploit symmetries in the applied external forces which often strongly suppress
integration errors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that so-called `symplectic
correctors' (which reduce energy errors by orders of magnitude at fixed
computational cost) apply equally well to weakly dissipative systems and can
thus be more generally thought of as `weak splitting correctors.' Finally, we
show that previously advocated approaches of incorporating additional forces

qualitatively wrong answers for conservative but velocity-dependent forces like
post-Newtonian corrections. We release REBOUNDx, an open-source C library for

applications due to their high efficiency. However, we find that the loss
functions adopted by single-stage object detectors hurt the localization
accuracy seriously. Firstly, the standard cross-entropy loss for classification
is independent of the localization task and drives all the positive examples to
learn as high classification scores as possible regardless of localization
accuracy during training. As a result, there will be many detections that have
high classification scores but low IoU or detections that have low
classification scores but high IoU. Secondly, for the standard smooth L1 loss,
the gradient is dominated by the outliers that have poor localization accuracy
during training. The above two problems will decrease the localization accuracy
of single-stage detectors. In this work, IoU-balanced loss functions that
consist of IoU-balanced classification loss and IoU-balanced localization loss
are proposed to solve the above problems. The IoU-balanced classification loss
pays more attention to positive examples with high IoU and can enhance the
correlation between classification and localization tasks. The IoU-balanced
localization loss decreases the gradient of examples with low IoU and increases
the gradient of examples with high IoU, which can improve the localization
accuracy of models. Extensive experiments on challenging public datasets such
as MS COCO, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes demonstrate that both IoU-balanced losses
can bring substantial improvement for the popular single-stage detectors,
especially for the localization accuracy. On COCO test-dev, the proposed
methods can substantially improve AP by $1.0\%\sim1.7\%$ and AP75 by

physics still raises unsolved physical problems. In particular, the nature of
the two-peak structure in the valence band photoemission spectra is still
controversial. By using \textit{ab initio} LQSGW+DMFT, the two-peak structure
is shown to be driven by the concerted effect of antiferromagnetic ordering and
intersite electron hopping. Magnetic ordering in the Ni-$e_{g}$ orbitals splits
majority- and minority-spin Ni-$t_{2g}$ levels due to local Hund's coupling.
Strong hybridization between O-$p$ and Ni-$e_g$, a signature of the Zhang-Rice
bound state formation, boosts oxygen-mediated intersite Ni-$e_g$ orbital
hopping, resulting in the enhancement of majority-spin Ni $t_{2g}$-$e_{g}$
splitting. Interestingly, these two splittings of distinct physical origins
match and give rise to the observed two-peak structure in NiO. Our new

film on a SrTiO3 (STO) substrate has stimulated significant research interest
but remains elusive. Using low-temperature, voltage-gated Raman spectroscopy
and low-temperature valence electron energy loss spectroscopy (VEELS), we
characterize the phonon behavior and interfacial charge transfer in single- and
few-layer FeSe films on STO. Raman measurements reveal ambipolar softening of
the FeSe vibrational modes, mimicking that of the underlying STO substrate. We
attribute this behavior to an interfacial coupling effect of STO on FeSe
lattice dynamics. This interfacial coupling effect is further supported by
local electron effective mass enhancement, which is determined from the
red-shift in the FeSe VEELS spectrum near the FeSe/STO interface. Our work
sheds light on the possible interfacial mechanisms contributing to the enhanced
superconductivity across the FeSe/STO interface and further unveils the
potential of low-temperature gated Raman spectroscopy and VEELS in clarifying a
broad category of quantum materials.

transfer and chemical modelling. The three species display extended emission
with several enhanced emission shells. CS displays the most extended
distribution reaching distances up to approximately 20''. SiS and SiO emission
have similar sizes of approximately 11'', but SiS emission is slightly more
compact. We have estimated fractional abundances relative to H$_2$, which on
average are equal to f(SiO)$\sim$10$^{-7}$, f(SiS)$\sim$10$^{-6}$, and
f(CS)$\sim$10$^{-6}$ up to the photo-dissociation region. The observations and
analysis presented here show evidence that the circumstellar material displays
clear deviations from an homogeneous spherical wind, with clumps and low
density shells that may allow UV photons from the interstellar medium (ISM) to
penetrate deep into the envelope, shifting the photo-dissociation radius
inwards. Our chemical model predicts photo-dissociation radii compatible with
those derived from the observations, although it is unable to predict abundance
variations from the starting radius of the calculations ($\sim$10$R_{*}$),

Concurrent execution of database transactions may violate complex structural

one way to ameliorate the difficulty of understanding how concurrent accesses

at scale, where database state is often replicated to improve latency and

framework for detecting serializability violations in (SQL) database-backed
Java applications executing on weakly-consistent storage systems. We manifest
our approach in a tool named CLOTHO, that combines a static analyzer and a
model checker to generate abstract executions, discover serializability
violations in these executions, and translate them back into concrete test
inputs suitable for deployment in a test environment. To the best of our
knowledge, CLOTHO is the first automated test generation facility for
identifying serializability anomalies of Java applications intended to operate
in geo-replicated distributed environments. An experimental evaluation on a set

communication, which is highly appealing for systems where the trade-off
between signaling overhead and the actual data transmission is very critical.
Modeling the time-selective fading channel as a first-order autoregressive (AR)
process, we propose a new receiver architecture based on the direct averaging
of the received signal samples for detection, which departs significantly from
the energy averaging-based receivers considered in the literature. For the
proposed setup, we characterize the exact asymptotic bit error rate (BER) for
both single-antenna (SA) and multi-antenna (MA) receivers, and demonstrate the
robustness of the new architecture to timing errors. Our results demonstrate
that while the direct-link (DL) interference from the ambient power source
leads to a BER floor in the SA receiver, the MA receiver can remove this
interference by estimating the angle of arrival (AoA) of the DL. The analysis
further quantifies the effect of improved angular resolution on the BER as a
function of the number of receive antennas. A key intermediate result of our
analysis is the derivation of a new concentration result for a general sum
sequence that is central to the derivation of the conditional distributions of
the received signal.

that they are not separate from the overall cluster dwarf population. UDGs in
cluster environments form primarily from dwarf galaxies that experienced early
cluster in-fall and subsequent quenching due to ram pressure. The ensuing
dimming of these dwarf galaxies due to passive stellar evolution results in a
population of very low surface brightness galaxies that are otherwise typical
dwarfs. UDGs and non-UDGs alike are affected by tidal interactions with the
cluster potential. Tidal stripping of dark matter, as well as mass loss from
stellar evolution, results in the adiabatic expansion of stars, particularly in
the lowest mass dwarfs. High mass dwarf galaxies show signatures of tidal
heating while low mass dwarfs that survive until $z=0$ typically have not
experienced such impulsive interactions. There is little difference between

solutions to the binary motion through treating radiation reaction as
perturbations and resumming the secular growth of perturbative terms. We
consider the spin-orbit effects at leading order and the 2.5PN radiation
reaction without orbit averaging or precession averaging for arbitrary
individual masses and spin magnitudes and orientations. The solutions are
written in a moving reference frame, with the orbital angular momentum and
binary radial directions aligned along two of the axes. The resummed solutions
show improved accuracy compared to adiabatic solutions while also being an
order of magnitude faster computationally compared to numerical integration

of proteins, such as carbomonoxy hemoglobin and $\gamma$D-crystallin. In human
$\gamma$D-crystallin, the phenomenon is associated with the mutation of the
23$^\mathrm{rd}$ residue, a proline, to a threonine, serine or valine. One
proposed microscopic mechanism for this effect entails an increase in
hydrophobicity upon mutagenesis. Recent crystal structures of a double mutant
that includes the P23T mutation allows for a more careful investigation of this
proposal. Here, we first measure the surface hydrophobicity of various mutant
structures of this protein and determine that it does not discernibly increase
upon the mutating the 23$^\mathrm{rd}$ residue. We then investigate the
solubility inversion regime with a schematic patchy particle model that
includes one of three models for temperature-dependent patch energies: two of
the hydrophobic effect, and a more generic description. We conclude that while
solubility inversion due to the hydrophobic effect may be possible, microscopic
evidence to support it in $\gamma$D-crystallin is weak. More generally, we find
that solubility inversion requires a fine balance between patch strengths and
the temperature-dependent contribution, which may explain why inverted
solubility is not commonly observed in proteins. In any event, we also find
that the temperature-dependent interaction has only a negligible impact on the
critical properties of the $\gamma$D-crystallin, in line with previous
experimental observations.

  A recent method called gSlider-SMS enables whole-brain sub-millimeter
diffusion MRI with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. However,
despite the efficient acquisition, the resulting images can still suffer from
low SNR due to the small size of the imaging voxels. This work proposes to
mitigate the SNR problem by combining gSlider-SMS with a regularized
SNR-enhancing reconstruction approach.
  Illustrative results show that, from gSlider-SMS data acquired over a span of
only 25 minutes on a 3T scanner, the proposed method is able to produce 71 MRI
images (64 diffusion encoding orientations with $b=$1500 s/mm$^2$, and 7 images
without diffusion weighting) of the entire \emph{in vivo} human brain with
nominal 0.66 mm spatial resolution. Using data acquired from 75 minutes of
acquisition as a gold standard reference, we demonstrate that the proposed
SNR-ehancement procedure leads to substantial improvements in estimated
diffusion parameters compared to conventional gSlider reconstruction. Results
also demonstrate that the proposed method has advantages relative to denoising
methods based on low-rank matrix modeling. A theoretical analysis of the
trade-off between spatial resolution and SNR suggests that the proposed
approach has high efficiency.

  Maximum Matching Approximation and Self-Stabilization","8 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the distributed backup-placement problem each node of a network has to
select one neighbor, such that the maximum number of nodes that make the same
selection is minimized. This is a natural relaxation of the perfect matching
problem, in which each node is selected just by one neighbor. Previous
(approximate) solutions for backup placement are non-trivial, even for simple
graph topologies, such as dense graphs. In this paper we devise an algorithm
for dense graph topologies, including unit disk graphs, unit ball graphs, line
graphs, graphs with bounded diversity, and many more. Our algorithm requires
just one round, and is as simple as the following operation. Consider a
circular list of neighborhood IDs, sorted in an ascending order, and select the
ID that is next to the selecting vertex ID. Surprisingly, such a simple
one-round strategy turns out to be very efficient for backup placement
computation in dense networks. Not only that it improves the number of rounds
of the solution, but also the approximation ratio is improved by a
multiplicative factor of at least $2$.
  Our new algorithm has several interesting implications. In particular, it
gives rise to a $(2 + \epsilon)$-approximation to maximum matching within
$O(\log^* n)$ rounds in dense networks. The resulting algorithm is very simple
as well, in sharp contrast to previous algorithms that compute such a solution
within this running time. Moreover, these algorithms are applicable to a
narrower graph family than our algorithm. For the same graph family, the best
previously-known result has $O(\log {\Delta} + \log^* n)$ running time. Another
interesting implication is the possibility to execute our backup placement
algorithm as-is in the self-stabilizing setting. This makes it possible to
simplify and improve other algorithms for the self-stabilizing setting, by
employing helpful properties of backup placement.

the question of when modifying $K$ by adding $m>0$ half-twists to two
oppositely-oriented strands, while keeping the rest of $K$ fixed, produces a
knot isotopic to $K$. Such a two-strand twist of order $m$, as we define it, is
a generalized crossing change when $m$ is even and a non-coherent band surgery
when $m=1$. A cosmetic two-strand twist on $K$ is a non-nugatory one that
produces an isotopic knot. We prove that fibered knots in $M$ admit no cosmetic
generalized crossing changes. Further, we show that if $K$ is fibered, then a
two-strand twist of odd order $m$ that is determined by a separating arc in a
fiber surface for $K$ can only be cosmetic if $m=\pm 1$.
  After proving these theorems, we further investigate cosmetic two-strand
twists of odd orders. Through two examples, we find that the second theorem
above becomes false if `separating' is removed, and that a key technical
proposition fails when the order equals 1. A closer look at an order-one
example, an instance of cosmetic band surgery on the unknot, reveals it to be
nearly trivial in a sense that we name `weakly nugatory'. We correct the
technical proposition to obtain a means of using double branched covers to show
that certain band surgeries are weakly nugatory. As an application, we prove
that every cosmetic band surgery on the unknot is of this type.

remains unclear for two reasons: i) a lack of definition of resonance for the
fully-coupled fluid-structure interaction system in a viscous flow, and ii) the
presence of nonlinear effects, which makes it difficult to disentangle resonant
and non-resonant mechanisms in finite-amplitude swimming. We address point i)
and provide an unambiguous definition for system resonance by computing global
linear stability modes of the fully-coupled fluid-structure interaction system
that account for the viscous fluid, the plate, and the coupling between them.
We then resolve point ii) by considering high-fidelity nonlinear simulations of
systematically increased amplitude. By comparing the results for different
amplitudes with one another and with the linear stability modes, we separate
linear and/or resonant effects from nonlinear and/or non-resonant effects.
Resonant behavior is observed over a wide range of plate stiffnesses, with
peaks in trailing-edge motion and thrust occurring near the resonant frequency
defined by the global linear analysis. The peaks broaden and weaken with
increasing heave amplitude, consistent with an increased damping effect from
the fluid. At the same time, non-resonant mechanisms are present at large heave
amplitudes. The input power exhibits qualitatively different dynamics at large
heave amplitudes compared to smaller heave amplitudes, where resonance
dominates. Moreover, leading-edge separation is present for stiff plates at
large heave amplitudes, which can drastically alter the performance
characteristics from what one would expect through linear predictions.

with the binary's orbital angular momentum. The apparently complicated dynamics
can in most cases be described as simple precession of the orbital angular
momentum about an approximately fixed total angular momentum. However, the
imprint of the precession on the observed gravitational-wave signal is yet more
complicated, with a non-trivial time-varying dependence on black-hole dynamics,
the binary's orientation and the detector polarization. As a result, it is
difficult to predict under which conditions precession effects are measurable
in gravitational-wave observations, and their impact on both signal detection
and source characterization. We show that the observed waveform can be
simplified by decomposing it as a power series in a new precession parameter $b
= \tan(\beta/2)$, where $\beta$ is the opening angle between the orbital and
total angular momenta. The power series is made up of five harmonics, with
frequencies that differ by the binary's precession frequency, and individually
do not exhibit amplitude and phase modulations. In many cases, the waveform can
be well approximated by the two leading harmonics. In this approximation we are
able to obtain a simple picture of precession as caused by the beating of two
waveforms of similar frequency. This enables us to identify regions of the
parameter space where precession is likely to have an observable effect on the
waveform, and to propose a new approach to searching for signals from
precessing binaries, based upon the two-harmonic approximation.

coupled-channel model, based on the UQM formalism. The latter provides a
possible solution to the long-standing problem of convergence in UQM
calculations; it also makes it possible to distinguish between states which are
almost pure quarkonia and exotic states, characterized by non-negligible

$\chi_{\rm b}(3P)$'s as almost pure bottomonia. Other possible applications of
the UQM and the UQM-based coupled-channel model formalisms to the calculation

with increasing $g_{\gamma}$ and $\kappa$ in the weak coupling regime for both

the Purcell effect. The current enhancement is due to the contribution of the
photon replica states to the electron transport in which intraband transitions
play an important role. The properties of the electron transport are
drastically changed in the strong coupling regime with an $x$-polarized photon

insensitivity of the tumbling chaotic zone volume to eccentricity. After a
tumbling body enters the spin synchronous resonance, it can exhibit long lived
non-principal axis rotation and this too can prolong the period of time with
enhanced tidally generated energy dissipation. The low orbital eccentricities
of Phobos and Deimos could in part be due to spin excitation by nearly
catastrophic impacts rather than tidal evolution following orbital resonance

secondly, it implements entangled-source multiplexing, greatly enhancing the

elaborate on this picture, particularly emphasizing the importance of the
chaotic nature of the string (UV) dynamics across all low energy species in
generating large (IR) spacetime behind the horizon. Implications of this UV/IR
relation include O(1) breaking of global symmetries at the string scale and a
self-repair mechanism of black holes restoring the smoothness of their
horizons. We also generalize the framework to other systems, including Rindler,
de Sitter, and asymptotically flat spacetimes, and find a consistent picture in
each case. Finally, we discuss the origin of the particular construction
adopted in describing the black hole interior as well as the outside of a de
Sitter horizon. We argue that the construction is selected by the
quantum-to-classical transition, in particular the applicability of the Born

to say, we construct the `smearing functions' $K$ of HKLL but with different

interpolate between Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions and we give

This flow between boundary conditions is known to be captured in the boundary
by adding a double-trace deformation to the CFT. Indeed, we explicitly show
that using $K$ there is a consistent and explicit map from a Wightman function
of the boundary QFT to a Wightman function of the bulk theory. In order to
accomplish this we have to study first the microlocal properties of the
boundary two-point function of the perturbed CFT and prove its wavefront set
satisfies the microlocal spectrum condition. This permits to assert that $K$

not only robot control but also other applications ranging from industrial
process control to rehabilitation. A property that makes these predictive
approaches well suited for robotics is that they can be learned online and
incrementally through interaction with the environment. However, a remaining
challenge for many prediction-learning approaches is an appropriate choice of
prediction-learning parameters, especially parameters that control the
magnitude of a learning machine's updates to its predictions (the learning rate
or step size). To begin to address this challenge, we examine the use of online
step-size adaptation using a sensor-rich robotic arm. Our method of choice,
Temporal-Difference Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (TIDBD), learns and adapts step
sizes on a feature level; importantly, TIDBD allows step-size tuning and
representation learning to occur at the same time. We show that TIDBD is a
practical alternative for classic Temporal-Difference (TD) learning via an
extensive parameter search. Both approaches perform comparably in terms of
predicting future aspects of a robotic data stream. Furthermore, the use of a
step-size adaptation method like TIDBD appears to allow a system to
automatically detect and characterize common sensor failures in a robotic
application. Together, these results promise to improve the ability of robotic
devices to learn from interactions with their environments in a robust way,

not clear whether one can extract the phenomenological predictions obtained in

Thiemann classical identities for the regularized expressions, while the second
is obtained as a first approximation of the expectation value of a Hamiltonian

considerable attention in recent years. Compressed sensing emerged as a popular
framework for sparse signal reconstruction from a small set of compressed
measurements. However, typical compressed sensing designs measure a
(non)linearly weighted combination of all input signal elements, which poses
practical challenges. These designs are also not necessarily task-optimal. In
addition, real-time recovery is hampered by the iterative and time-consuming
nature of sparse recovery algorithms. Recently, deep learning methods have
shown promise for fast recovery from compressed measurements, but the design of
adequate and practical sensing strategies remains a challenge. Here, we propose
a deep learning solution termed Deep Probabilistic Sub-sampling (DPS), that

straightforwardly implementable, e.g. by non-uniform analog-to-digital

galaxy formation processes on the matter power spectrum using a halo model that
treats the stars and gas separately from the dark matter distribution. We use
empirical constraints from X-ray observations (hot gas) and halo occupation
distribution modelling (stars) for the baryons. Since X-ray observations cannot
generally measure the hot gas content outside $r_\mathrm{500c}$, we vary the
gas density profiles beyond this radius. Compared with dark matter only models,
we find a total power suppression of $1 \%$ ($5 \%$) on scales $0.2-1
h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ ($0.5-2h/\mathrm{Mpc}$), where lower baryon fractions result in
stronger suppression. We show that groups of galaxies ($10^{13} <
m_\mathrm{500c} / (\mathrm{M_\odot}/h) < 10^{14}$) dominate the total power at
all scales $k \lesssim 10 h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. We find that a halo mass bias of $30
\%$ (similar to what is expected from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption)
results in an underestimation of the power suppression of up to $4 \%$ at $k =
1 h/\mathrm{Mpc}$, illustrating the importance of measuring accurate halo
masses. Contrary to work based on hydrodynamical simulations, our conclusion
that baryonic effects can no longer be neglected is not subject to
uncertainties associated with our poor understanding of feedback processes.
Observationally, probing the outskirts of groups and clusters will provide the
tightest constraints on the power suppression for $k \lesssim 1

effective models of natural phenomena by choosing a minimal level of
description capable of capturing the essential features of the physical reality
of interest, the scientific community has identified a set of general rules
that the model must incorporate if it aspires to be consistent with the body of
known experimental evidence. Some of these rules are believed to be so general
that we think of them as laws of Nature, such as the great conservation
principles, whose ""greatness"" derives from their generality, as masterfully
explained by Feynman in one of his legendary lectures. The second law of
thermodynamics is universally contemplated among the great laws of Nature. In
this paper we show that, in the past four decades, an enormous body of
scientific research devoted to modeling the essential features of
nonequilibrium natural phenomena has converged from many different directions
and frameworks towards the general recognition (albeit still expressed in
different but equivalent forms and language) that another rule is also
indispensable and reveals another great law of Nature that we propose to call
the \caporali{fourth law of thermodynamics}. We state it as follows: every
nonequilibrium state of a system or local subsystem for which entropy is
well-defined must be equipped with a metric in state space with respect to
which the irreversible component of its time evolution is in the direction of
steepest entropy ascent compatible with the conservation constraints. To
illustrate the power of the fourth law, we derive (nonlinear) extensions of
Onsager reciprocity and fluctuation-dissipation relations to the
far-nonequilibrium realm within the framework of the rate-controlled
constrained-equilibrium (RCCE) approximation (also known as the
quasi-equilibrium approximation).

  OCO-2 O2 A-band measurements","35 pages, 17 figures",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantifying the vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols is crucial for
estimating their impact on the Earth energy budget and climate, improving
forecast of air pollution in cities, and reducing biases in the retrieval of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) from space. However, to date, passive remote sensing
measurements have provided limited information about aerosol extinction
profiles. In this study, we propose the use of a spectral sorting approach to
constrain the aerosol vertical structure using spectra of reflected sunlight
absorption within the molecular oxygen (O2) A-band collected by the Orbiting
Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated
using spectra acquired over the western Sahara coast by comparing the aerosol
profile retrievals with lidar measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and
Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with
Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Using a radiative transfer model to simulate
OCO-2 measurements, we found that high-resolution O2 A-band measurements have
high sensitivity to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol layer height (ALH).
Retrieved estimates of AOD and ALH based on a look up table technique show good
agreement with CALIPSO measurements, with correlation coefficients of 0.65 and
0.53, respectively. The strength of the proposed spectral sorting technique
lies in its ability to identify spectral channels with high sensitivity to AOD
and ALH and extract the associated information from the observed radiance in a
straightforward manner. The proposed approach has the potential to enable
future passive remote sensing missions to map the aerosol vertical distribution
on a global scale.

complex nature of the mathematical model, it is not possible to find analytical
solutions, and one has to resort to numerical solutions. It is therefore
desirable to have a procedure that can serve as a measure to assess the
veracity of numerical solutions. In this paper, we establish that unsteady
solutions under the transient DPP model are stable in the sense of Lyapunov. We
also show that the unsteady solutions grow at most linear with time. These
results not only have a theoretical value but also serve as valuable a

under anisotropic medium properties, as analytical solutions are scarce for
these scenarios under the DPP model.

cavities and azimuthal asymmetries such as dust traps and clumps. The presence
of a stellar binary system in the inner disc regions has been proposed to
explain the formation of these structures. Here, we study the dust and gas
dynamics in circumbinary discs around eccentric and inclined binaries. This is
done through two-fluid simulations of circumbinary discs, considering different
values of the binary eccentricity and inclination. We find that two kinds of
dust structures can form in the disc: a single horseshoe-shaped clump, on top
of a similar gaseous over-density; or numerous clumps, distributed along the
inner disc rim. The latter features form through the complex interplay between
the dust particles and the gaseous spirals caused by the binary. All these
clumps survive between one and several tens of orbital periods at the feature
location. We show that their evolution strongly depends on the gas-dust
coupling and the binary parameters. Interestingly, these asymmetric features
could in principle be used to infer or constrain the orbital parameters of a
stellar companion - potentially unseen - inside the inner disc cavity. Finally,
we apply our findings to the disc around AB Aurigae.

encoded features spatially while aggregating all the temporal information. As a
result, a single prediction map is produced from an input clip of multiple

been the key to achieving superior performance downstream. While fine-tuning
these pre-trained models is straightforward for lexical applications
(applications with only language modality), it is not trivial for multimodal
language (a growing area in NLP focused on modeling face-to-face

accept two extra modalities of vision and acoustic. In this paper, we proposed
an attachment to BERT and XLNet called Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG). MAG
allows BERT and XLNet to accept multimodal nonverbal data during fine-tuning.
It does so by generating a shift to internal representation of BERT and XLNet;
a shift that is conditioned on the visual and acoustic modalities. In our
experiments, we study the commonly used CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets for
multimodal sentiment analysis. Fine-tuning MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet significantly
boosts the sentiment analysis performance over previous baselines as well as
language-only fine-tuning of BERT and XLNet. On the CMU-MOSI dataset, MAG-XLNet
achieves human-level multimodal sentiment analysis performance for the first

Contact line pinning at rings of polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine)

when the hydrophobically modified mSi is moved or tilted and prevents dewetting

readily roll off. The PS-b-P2VP fiber rings were prepared by dropping PS-b-P2VP
solution onto hydrophobically modified mSi. Selective swelling of the P2VP in
the thus-formed circular PS-b-P2VP films with hot ethanol followed by
detachment of the latter yielded hydrophobically modified mSi exhibiting
annular areas, in which ruptured PS-b-P2VP fibers protruded from the mSi
macropores. For example, PS-b-P2VP fiber rings with diameters of 6.5 mm and
widths of about 0.2 mm immobilize water drops with a volume of 50 microliters.

reachability properties, that is, on the existence of chains of references
between objects in the heap. Reasoning about reachability is difficult for two
main reasons. First, any heap modification may affect an unbounded number of
reference chains, which complicates modular verification, in particular,
framing. Second, general graph reachability is not supported by SMT solvers,
which impedes automatic verification. In this paper, we present a modular
specification and verification technique for reachability properties in
separation logic. For each method, we specify reachability only locally within
the fragment of the heap on which the method operates. A novel form of
reachability framing for relatively convex subheaps allows one to extend
reachability properties from the heap fragment of a callee to the larger
fragment of its caller, enabling precise procedure-modular reasoning. Our
technique supports practically important heap structures, namely acyclic graphs
with a bounded outdegree as well as (potentially cyclic) graphs with at most
one path (modulo cycles) between each pair of nodes. The integration into
separation logic allows us to reason about reachability and other properties in
a uniform way, to verify concurrent programs, and to automate our technique via
existing separation logic verifiers. We demonstrate that our verification
technique is amenable to SMT-based verification by encoding a number of
benchmark examples into the Viper verification infrastructure.

usually exhibit a wide range of variations on poses and there is no available
animal pose dataset for training and testing. To address this problem, we build
an animal pose dataset to facilitate training and evaluation. Considering the
heavy labor needed to label dataset and it is impossible to label data for all
concerned animal species, we, therefore, proposed a novel cross-domain
adaptation method to transform the animal pose knowledge from labeled animal
classes to unlabeled animal classes. We use the modest animal pose dataset to
adapt learned knowledge to multiple animals species. Moreover, humans also
share skeleton similarities with some animals (especially four-footed mammals).
Therefore, the easily available human pose dataset, which is of a much larger
scale than our labeled animal dataset, provides important prior knowledge to
boost up the performance on animal pose estimation. Experiments show that our

it is important to respect the system constraints that rely on the bandit's

stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with safety constraints that depend
(linearly) on an unknown parameter vector. As such, the learner is unable to
identify all safe actions and must act conservatively in ensuring that her

the learner chooses her actions at random from a restricted set of safe actions
with the goal of learning a good approximation of the entire unknown safe set.
Once this goal is achieved, the algorithm begins a safe
exploration-exploitation phase where the learner gradually expands their
estimate of the set of safe actions while controlling the growth of regret. We
provide a general regret bound for the algorithm, as well as a problem
dependent bound that is connected to the location of the optimal action within
the safe set. We then propose a modified heuristic that exploits our problem

kernel-Gram matrix $\boldsymbol K$ yields an operator whose counterpart in an
RKHS $\mathcal H$, is a \emph{random projection} operator---in the spirit of
Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma. To be precise, given a random matrix $Z$
with i.i.d. Gaussian entries, we show that a sketch $Z\boldsymbol{K}$
corresponds to a particular random operator in (infinite-dimensional) Hilbert
space $\mathcal H$ that maps functions $f \in \mathcal H$ to a low-dimensional
space $\mathbb R^d$, while preserving a weighted RKHS inner-product of the form
$\langle f, g \rangle_{\Sigma} \doteq \langle f, \Sigma^3 g \rangle_{\mathcal
H}$, where $\Sigma$ is the \emph{covariance} operator induced by the data
distribution. In particular, under similar assumptions as in kernel PCA (KPCA),
or kernel $k$-means (K-$k$-means), well-separated subsets of feature-space
$\{K(\cdot, x): x \in \cal X\}$ remain well-separated after such operation,
which suggests similar benefits as in KPCA and/or K-$k$-means, albeit at the
much cheaper cost of a random projection. In particular, our convergence rates
suggest that, given a large dataset $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^N$ of size $N$, we can build
the Gram matrix $\boldsymbol K$ on a much smaller subsample of size $n\ll N$,
so that the sketch $Z\boldsymbol K$ is very cheap to obtain and subsequently
apply as a projection operator on the original data $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^N$. We
verify these insights empirically on synthetic data, and on real-world
clustering applications.

time-varying oil and water rates at production wells) for new geological

presented for an individual geological realization and for an ensemble of 500

data assimilation (history matching) in a channelized system. For this study,
posterior reservoir models are generated using the randomized maximum
likelihood method, with the permeability field represented using the recently
developed CNN-PCA parameterization. The flow responses required during the data
assimilation procedure are provided by the recurrent R-U-Net. The overall
approach is shown to lead to substantial reduction in prediction uncertainty.
High-fidelity numerical simulation results for the posterior geomodels

Population analysis of such transformations is expected to capture the

required to produce anatomically feasible correspondences. This is usually
enforced through some smoothness-based generic regularization on deformation
field. Alternatively, population-based regularization has been shown to produce
anatomically accurate correspondences in cases where anatomically unaware

unsupervised image registration, these methods are computationally faster and
maintains the accuracy of state of the art methods. However, these networks use
smoothness penalty on deformation fields and ignores population-level
statistics of the transformations. We propose a novel neural network
architecture that simultaneously learns and uses the population-level
statistics of the spatial transformations to regularize the neural networks for
unsupervised image registration. This regularization is in the form of a
bottleneck autoencoder, which encodes the population level information of the
deformation fields in a low-dimensional manifold. The proposed architecture
produces deformation fields that describe the population-level features and

time and cost consuming in terms of resources used. With advances in

to extract Hamiltonian parameters. However, the number of labeled images is
rather limited. Here, we provide a protocol for Hamiltonian parameter
estimation based on a machine learning architecture, which is trained on a
small amount of simulated images and applied to experimental spin configuration
images. Sliding windows on the input images enlarges the number of training
images; therefore we can train well a neural network on a small dataset of
simulated images which are generated adaptively using the same external
conditions such as temperature and magnetic field as the experiment. The neural
network is applied to the experimental image and estimates magnetic parameters
efficiently. We demonstrate the success of the estimation by reproducing the
same configuration from simulation and predict a hysteresis loop accurately.
Our approach paves a way to a stable and general parameter estimation.

of superlattices (SLs) as interfaces change from perfectly abrupt to totally
intermixed, by using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in
combination with the spectral heat current calculations. We highlight the role
of surface-interdiffusion-driven intermixing by calculating the $\kappa$ of SLs
with changing interface roughness, whose tuning allows for the $\kappa$ values
much lower than the ""alloy limit"" and the abrupt interface limit in same cases.
The interplay between alloy and interface scattering in different frequency
ranges provides a physical basis to predict a minimum of thermal conductivity.
More specifically, we also explore how the interface roughness affects the
thermal conductivities for SLs materials with a broad span of atomic mass and
bond strength. In particular, we find that (i) only when the ""spacer"" thickness
of SLs increases up to a critical value the $\kappa$ of rough SLs can break the
corresponding ""alloy limit"". (ii) Whether the $\kappa$ changes monotonically as
interface roughness strongly depends on the period length and intrinsic
behavior of phonon transport for SLs materials. Especially, for the SL with
large period length, there exists an optimal interface roughness which can
minimize the thermal conductivity. (iii) Surface-interdiffusion-driven
intermixing is more effective in achieving the low $\kappa$ below the alloy
limit for SL materials with large mass mismatch than with small one. (iv) It's
possible for SLs materials with large lattice mismatch (i.e., bond strength) to
design an ideally abrupt interface structure with $\kappa$ much below the
""alloy limit"". These results have a clear implications for optimization of
thermal transport for heat management and for the development of thermoelectric
materials.

demonstrate it is not applicable. Sampling transit SNR does not set up random,
independent planet radii, and so it is unsuitable for corroborating (or
falsifying) detection bias as the origin of apparent patterns in planet radius.
By sampling the planet radii directly and using a simple model for Kepler's

approximated by polytopes (polygons in 2D and polyhedra in 3D) and, due to
this, the implementation in 3D is nontrivial. The main novelty in this paper is
the approximation of the regions by balls, whose intersections are much cheaper
to compute than those of polytopes. Of course, balls cannot fully tessellate a
region, and hence some mass may be lost. We perform some adjustments, and also
solve an optimisation problem, in order to yield a scheme that is both locally

similar to those obtained from an implementation which uses polytopal

is that since it is not known a-priori what the accuracy of the collected data
from each sensor is, the performance can be negatively affected if the
collected information is not fused appropriately. For example, the data
collector may measure the phenomenon inappropriately, or alternatively, the
sensors could be out of calibration, thus introducing random gain and bias to
the measurement process. Such readings would be systematically distorted,
leading to incorrect estimation of the spatial field. To combat this
detrimental effect, we develop a robust version of the spatial field model
based on a mixture of Gaussian process experts. We then develop two different
approaches for Bayesian spatial field reconstruction: the first algorithm is
the Spatial Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (S-BLUE), in which one considers the
quadratic loss function and restricts the estimator to the linear family of
transformations; the second algorithm is based on empirical Bayes, which
utilises a two-stage estimation procedure to produce accurate predictive
inference in the presence of ""misbehaving"" sensors. In addition, we develop the

$\sigma_T$ and the rms velocity $\sigma_w$ in the bulk of Rayleigh-B\'enard

and numerical data from previous studies. We find that, once scaled by the
convective temperature $\theta_*$, the value of $\sigma_T$ at the cell centre
is a constant, i.e. $\sigma_{T,c}/\theta_* \approx 0.85$, over a wide range of
the Rayleigh number ($10^{8}\leq Ra\leq 10^{15}$) and the Prandtl number
($0.7\leq Pr \leq 23.34$), and is independent of the surface topographies of
the top and bottom plates of the convection cell. A constant close to unity
suggests that $\theta_*$ is a proper measure of the temperature fluctuation in
the core region. On the other hand, $\sigma_{w,c}/w_*$, the vertical rms
velocity at the cell centre scaled by the convective velocity $w_*$, shows a
weak $Ra$-dependence ($\sim Ra^{0.07\pm0.02}$) over $10^8\leq Ra\leq 10^{10}$
at $Pr\sim4.3$ and is independent of plate topography. Similar to a previous
finding by He \& Xia ({\it Phys. Rev. Lett.,} vol. 122, 2019, 014503), we find
that the rms temperature profile $\sigma_T(z)/\theta_*$ in the region of the
mixing zone with a mean horizontal shear exhibits a power-law dependence on the
distance $z$ from the plate, but now the universal profile applies to both
smooth and rough surface topographies and over a wider range of $Ra$. The
vertical rms velocity profile $\sigma_w(z)/w_*$ obey a logarithmic dependence
on $z$. The study thus demonstrates that the typical scales for the temperature
and the velocity are the convective temperature $\theta_*$ and the the
convective velocity $w_*$, respectively. Finally, we note that $\theta_*$ may
be utilised to study the flow regime transitions in the ultra-high-$Ra$-number
turbulent convection.

  Pedestrian Crowd-Sensing",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The popularity and proliferation of electric scooters (e-scooters) as a
micromobility solution in our cities and urban communities has been rapidly
rising. Rent-by-the-minute pricing and a healthy competition between
micromobility service providers is also benefiting riders with low trip costs.
However, an unprepared urban infrastructure, combined with uncertain operation
policies and poor regulation enforcement, has resulted in e-scooter riders
encroaching public spaces meant for pedestrians, thus causing significant
safety concerns both for themselves and the pedestrians. As a consequence, it
has become critical to understand the current state of pedestrian safety in our
urban communities vis-\`{a}-vis e-scooter services, identify factors that
impact pedestrian safety due to such services, and determine how to support
pedestrian safety going forward. Unfortunately, to date there have been no
realistic, data-driven efforts within the research community that address these
issues. In this work, we conduct a field study to empirically investigate
crowd-sensed encounter data between e-scooters and pedestrian participants on
two urban university campuses over a three-month period. We also analyze
encounter statistics and mobility trends that could identify potentially unsafe
spatio-temporal zones for pedestrians. This first-of-its-kind work provides a
preliminary blueprint on how crowd-sensed micromobility data can enable
safety-related studies in urban communities.

expressions (regexes) have achieved some success, but typically deal with
short, formulaic text and can only produce simple regexes. Realworld regexes
are complex, hard to describe with brief sentences, and sometimes require
examples to fully convey the user's intent. We present a framework for regex
synthesis in this setting where both natural language (NL) and examples are

natural language description into an intermediate sketch, which is an
incomplete regex containing holes to denote missing components. Then a program
synthesizer searches over the regex space defined by the sketch and finds a
regex that is consistent with the given string examples. Our semantic parser
can be trained purely from weak supervision based on correctness of the
synthesized regex, or it can leverage heuristically-derived sketches. We
evaluate on two prior datasets (Kushman and Barzilay, 2013; Locascio et al.,

does belong to the more general class of polynomial processes, which allows us
to compute all conditional moments of the stock price and the cumulative

single crystal and ZnO nanorods coated with a 2 nm Al layer has been
investigated using correlative photoluminescence and depth-resolved

Temperature-resolved cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence measurements
from 10 K to 250 K show enhancement factors up to 12 times of the free exciton
(FX) emission at 80 K. The FX couple more efficiently to the LSPs in Al
compared to the localized donor-bound excitons. Furthermore, a strong
polarization dependence of the LSPs with respect to the FX was observed with
higher enhanced FX transitions polarized in the same direction as the electric
field of the incident excitation. These results indicate that selective
enhancement of the ultra-violet excitonic PL in ZnO can be achieved by careful
alignment of the crystallographic axes of the ZnO relative to the electric

hybrid dual stage training policy of supervised reconstruction loss followed by
an unsupervised adversarial critic loss. However, there is a dearth of
literature for a fully unsupervised GAN based inpainting framework. The primary
aversion towards the latter genre is due to its prohibitively slow iterative
optimization requirement during inference to find a matching noise prior for a
masked image. In this paper, we show that priors matter in GAN: we learn a data
driven parametric network to predict a matching prior for a given image. This
converts an iterative paradigm to a single feed forward inference pipeline with
a massive 1500X speedup and simultaneous improvement in reconstruction quality.
We show that an additional structural prior imposed on GAN model results in
higher fidelity outputs. To extend our model for sequence inpainting, we
propose a recurrent net based grouped noise prior learning. To our knowledge,
this is the first demonstration of an unsupervised GAN based sequence
inpainting. A further improvement in sequence inpainting is achieved with an
additional subsequence consistency loss. These contributions improve the
spatio-temporal characteristics of reconstructed sequences. Extensive
experiments conducted on SVHN, Standford Cars, CelebA and CelebA-HQ image

transmission load $R$ and subpacketization $F$ as small as possible, in order
to improve efficiency of transmission in the peak traffic times and to decrease
implementation complexity. Yan et al. reformulated the centralized coded
caching scheme as designing a corresponding $F\times K$ array called placement
delivery array (PDA), where $F$ is the subpacketization and $K$ is the number
of users. Motivated by several constructions of PDAs, we introduce a framework
for constructing PDAs, where each row is indexed by a row vector of some matrix
called row index matrix and each column's index is labelled by an element of a
direct product set. Using this framework, a new scheme is obtained, which can
be regarded as a generalization of some previously known schemes. When $K$ is
equal to ${m\choose t}q^t$ for positive integers $m$, $t$ with $t<m$ and $q\geq
2$, we show that the row index matrix must be an orthogonal array if all the
users have the same memory size. Furthermore, the row index matrix must be a
covering array if the coded gain is ${m\choose t}$, which is the maximal coded
gain under our framework. Consequently the lower bounds on the transmission
load and subpacketization of the schemes are derived under our framework.
Finally, using orthogonal arrays as the row index matrix, we obtain two more
explicit classes of schemes which have significantly advantages on the
subpacketization while the transmission load is equal or close to that of the
schemes constructed by Shangguan et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 64,

electron-proton plasmas. We set up a diversity of density and field structures
(e.g., X-points and plasmoids) by varying the guide field strength and choosing
whether to trigger reconnection or let it spontaneously evolve. We show that
the number of X-points and plasmoids controls the efficiency of electron
acceleration, with more X-points leading to a higher efficiency. Using
on-the-fly acceleration diagnostics, we also show that the non-ideal electric
fields associated with X-points play a critical role in the first stages of
electron acceleration. As a further diagnostic, we include two populations of
test particles that selectively experience only certain components of electric
fields. We find that the out-of-plane component of the parallel electric field
determines the hardness of the high-energy tail of the electron energy
distribution. These results further our understanding of electron acceleration
in this regime of magnetic reconnection and have implications for realistic
models of black hole accretion flows.

achieved impressive improvement over the regular convolution operation.
However, existing models, eg. ResNeXt, still suffers from the sub-optimal

(GroupNet) built by using a novel dynamic grouping convolution (DGConv)
operation, which is able to learn the number of groups in an end-to-end manner.
The proposed approach has several appealing benefits. (1) DGConv provides a
unified convolution representation and covers many existing convolution
operations such as regular dense convolution, group convolution, and depthwise
convolution. (2) DGConv is a differentiable and flexible operation which learns
to perform various convolutions from training data. (3) GroupNet trained with
DGConv learns different number of groups for different convolution layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupNet outperforms its counterparts
such as ResNet and ResNeXt in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.
We also present introspection and reproducibility study, for the first time,
showing the learning dynamics of training group numbers.

in standard scenarios such as daytime scenes with favorable illumination
conditions. However, in face of adverse conditions such as the nighttime,
semantic segmentation loses its accuracy significantly. One of the main causes
of the problem is the lack of sufficient annotated segmentation datasets of
nighttime scenes. In this paper, we propose a framework to alleviate the
accuracy decline when semantic segmentation is taken to adverse conditions by
using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To bridge the daytime and
nighttime image domains, we made key observation that compared to datasets in
adverse conditions, there are considerable amount of segmentation datasets in
standard conditions such as BDD and our collected ZJU datasets. Our GAN-based
nighttime semantic segmentation framework includes two methods. In the first
method, GANs were used to translate nighttime images to the daytime, thus
semantic segmentation can be performed using robust models already trained on
daytime datasets. In another method, we use GANs to translate different ratio
of daytime images in the dataset to the nighttime but still with their labels.
In this sense, synthetic nighttime segmentation datasets can be generated to
yield models prepared to operate at nighttime conditions robustly. In our
experiment, the later method significantly boosts the performance at the
nighttime evidenced by quantitative results using Intersection over Union (IoU)
and Pixel Accuracy (Acc). We show that the performance varies with respect to
the proportion of synthetic nighttime images in the dataset, where the sweet
spot corresponds to most robust performance across the day and night.

this context, we highlight several aspects, in particular we discuss the
intrinsic degree of ill-posedness in terms of rearrangements of the multiplier

excitations are localized and can hardly propagate due to the energy barrier of
snakes. The emergence of such snake domains may shed light on the experimental
observation of dipolar spin ice under tilted fields, and provide a new strategy

challenges for model selection and evaluation. In particular, many
well-established statistical tools for selecting between models assume
conditional independence of observations and/or conventional asymptotics, and
their theoretical foundations are not always applicable in a network modeling
context. While simulation-based approaches to model adequacy assessment are now
widely used, there remains a need for procedures that quantify a model's
performance in a manner suitable for selecting among competing models. Here, we
propose to address this issue by developing a predictive evaluation strategy
for exponential family random graph models that is analogous to
cross-validation. Our approach builds on the held-out predictive evaluation
(HOPE) scheme introduced by Wang et al. (2016) to assess imputation
performance. We systematically hold out parts of the observed network to:
evaluate how well the model is able to predict the held-out data; identify
where the model performs poorly based on which data are held-out, indicating
e.g. potential weaknesses; and calculate general summaries of predictive
performance that can be used for model selection. As such, HOPE can assist
researchers in improving models by indicating where a model performs poorly,
and by quantitatively comparing predictive performance across competing models.
The proposed method is applied to model selection problem of two well-known
data sets, and the results are compared to those obtained via nominal AIC and
BIC scores.

There have been increasing attempts on modeling crowded scenes by introducing
ever larger property ontologies (attributes) and annotating ever larger
training datasets. However, in contrast to still images, manually annotating
video attributes needs to consider spatiotemporal evolution which is inherently
much harder and more costly. Critically, the most interesting crowd behaviors
captured in surveillance videos (e.g., street fighting, flash mobs) are either
rare, thus have few examples for model training, or unseen previously. Existing
crowd analysis techniques are not readily scalable to recognize novel (unseen)
crowd behaviors. To address this problem, we investigate and develop methods
for recognizing visual crowd behavioral attributes without any training
samples, i.e., zero-shot learning crowd behavior recognition. To that end, we
relax the common assumption that each individual crowd video instance is only
associated with a single crowd attribute. Instead, our model learns to jointly
recognize multiple crowd behavioral attributes in each video instance by
exploring multiattribute cooccurrence as contextual knowledge for optimizing
individual crowd attribute recognition. Joint multilabel attribute prediction
in zero-shot learning is inherently nontrivial because cooccurrence statistics
does not exist for unseen attributes. To solve this problem, we learn to
predict cross-attribute cooccurrence from both online text corpus and
multilabel annotation of videos with known attributes. Our experiments show
that this approach to modeling multiattribute context not only improves
zero-shot crowd behavior recognition on the WWW crowd video dataset, but also
generalizes to novel behavior (violence) detection cross-domain in the Violence
Flow video dataset.

positive and negative orthant respectively. Our proposed objective however
leads to a non-convex optimization problem, to which we resort to Riemannian
optimization schemes and derive an efficient conjugate gradient scheme on the
Stiefel manifold. To study the effectiveness of our scheme, we propose a new
dataset~\emph{Dash-Cam-Pose}, consisting of clips with skeleton poses of humans
seated in a car, the task being to classify the clips as normal or abnormal;
the latter is when any human pose is out-of-position with regard to say an
airbag deployment. Our experiments on the proposed Dash-Cam-Pose dataset, as
well as several other standard anomaly/novelty detection benchmarks demonstrate
the benefits of our scheme, achieving state-of-the-art one-class accuracy.

symmetric capacity of the binary-input discrete memoryless channels. But the
analysis and construction of polar codes involve the complex
iterative-calculation. In this paper, by revisiting the error event of the
polarized channel, a new concept, named polar spectrum, is introduced from the
weight distribution of polar codes. Thus we establish a systematic framework in
term of the polar spectrum to analyze and construct polar codes. By using polar
spectrum, we derive the union bound and the union-Bhattacharyya (UB) bound of
the error probability of polar codes and the upper/lower bound of the symmetric
capacity of the polarized channel. The analysis based on the polar spectrum can
intuitively interpret the performance of polar codes under successive
cancellation (SC) decoding. Furthermore, we analyze the coding structure of
polar codes and design an enumeration algorithm based on the MacWilliams
identities to efficiently calculate the polar spectrum. In the end, two
construction metrics named UB bound weight (UBW) and simplified UB bound weight
(SUBW) respectively, are designed based on the UB bound and the polar spectrum.
Not only are these two constructions simple and explicit for the practical
polar coding, but they can also generate polar codes with similar (in SC
decoding) or superior (in SC list decoding) performance over those based on the
traditional methods.

  The first (FedMMD) is adopting a two-stream model with the MMD (Maximum Mean

trained on devices. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms
baselines, especially in non-IID FL settings, with a reduction of more than 20%

  The second is FL with feature fusion (FedFusion). By aggregating the features
from both the local and global models, we achieve higher accuracy at fewer

initialization for newly incoming clients and thus speed up the process of
convergence. Experiments in popular FL scenarios show that our FedFusion
outperforms baselines in both accuracy and generalization ability while

represents the bilateral cue of the foreground and background areas. The
bilateral cue is then fused with the occlusion cue to precisely locate the

FPEM is a cascadable U-shaped module, which can introduce multi-level

by the FPEMs of different depths into a final feature for segmentation. The
learnable post-processing is implemented by Pixel Aggregation (PA), which can
precisely aggregate text pixels by predicted similarity vectors. Experiments on

and sufficient conditions of complete transmission and complete reflection are
derived analytically. In the single-mode region, the complete transmission
caused by electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and the complete
reflection due to Fano resonance can both be achieved by adjusting the
emitter's parameters. But in the multi-mode region, except that the input-state

failures due to the high mobility caused by the sudden changes of the direction
of vehicles. The routing paths between two different vehicles should be
established with this challenge in mind. Stability and connectedness are a
mandatory condition to ensure a robust and reliable data delivery. The idea
behind this work is to exploit a new reactive routing technique to provide
regulated and well-connected routing paths. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or
what are referred to as drones can be both involved in the discovery process
and be full members in these discovered paths in order to avoid possible
disconnections on the ground when the network is sparsely connected. The
different tests of this technique are performed based on NS-2 simulator and the
outcomes are compared with those of related on-demand routing protocols
dedicated for VANETs. Interesting results are distinguished showing a reduced
end-to-end delay and a high delivery ratio, which proving that this
heterogeneous communication between vehicles and UAVs is able to extend the
network connectivity.

runaway threshold, liquid surface water vaporizes completely, which forms the
inner edge of the habitable zone. Because land planets can emit a large amount
of radiation from the dry tropics, they have a higher runaway threshold than
aqua planets do. Here we systematically investigated the runaway threshold for
various surface water distributions using a three-dimensional dynamic
atmosphere model. The runaway threshold for the meridionally uniform surface
water distribution increases from the typical value for the aqua-planet regime
(~130% S0) to one for the land-planet regime (~155% S0) as the dry surface area
increases, where S0 is the present Earth's insolation. Although this result is
similar to the previous work considering zonally uniform surface water
distributions, the runaway threshold for the land-planet regime is quite low
compared to that of the previous work. This is because a part of the tropical
atmosphere is always wet for the meridionally uniform case. We also considered
the surface water distributions determined by the Earth's, Mars' and Venus'
topographies. We found that their runaway thresholds are close to that for the
meridionally uniform cases, and the amount of water at the boundary between an
aqua- and land-planet regime is around 10% of the Earth's ocean. This clearly
shows that the runaway threshold is not determined uniquely by the luminosity
of the central star, but it has a wide range caused by the surface water
distribution of the terrestrial water planet itself.

have a counterpart visible on optical or NIR images but are not recorded as

constructible universe a regular cardinal is stationary reflecting if and only
if it is $\Pi^1_1$-indescribable: we show that in $L$ a cardinal is
$\Pi^{1}_{\gamma} $-indescribable iff it reflects $\gamma$-stationary sets.
More particularly (stating only the special case of $n$ finite):
  Theorem $(V=L)$ Let $n<\omega$ and $\kappa$ be $\Pi^{1}_{n}$-indescribable
but not $\Pi^1_{n+1}$-indescribable, and let $A\subseteq\kappa$ be

avoids $E_{A}$. Thus $\kappa$ is not $n+1$-reflecting.
  Certain assumptions on the $\gamma$-club filter allow us to prove that
$\gamma$-stationarity is downwards absolute to $L$, and allows for splitting of
$\gamma$-stationary sets. We define $\gamma$-ineffability, and look into the

major scientific challenge. It is now well established that social network
structure plays a central role for the viability of cooperation. However, not
much is known about the importance of the positions of cooperators in the
networks for the evolution of cooperation. Here, we investigate how cooperation
is affected by correlations between cooperativeness and individual social
connectedness. Using simulation models, we find that the effect of correlation
between cooperativeness and connectedness (degree) depends on the social
network structure, with positive effect in standard scale-free networks and no
effect in standard Poisson networks. Furthermore, when degree assortativity is
increased such that individuals cluster with others of similar social
connectedness, we find that bridge areas between social clusters can act as
barriers to the spread of defection, leading to strong enhancement of
cooperation in particular in Poisson networks. But this effect is sensitive to
the presence of Trojan horses (defectors placed within cooperator clusters).
The study provides new knowledge about the conditions under which cooperation
may evolve and persist, and the results are also relevant to consider in regard
to human cooperation experiments.

paper presents an interpretable generative modelling approach to medical image
translation. By allowing a common model for group-wise normalisation and
segmentation of brain scans to handle missing data, the model allows for
predicting entirely missing modalities from one, or a few, MR contrasts.
Furthermore, the model can be trained on a fairly small number of subjects. The
proposed model is validated on three clinically relevant scenarios. Results
appear promising and show that a principled, probabilistic model of the
relationship between multi-channel signal intensities can be used to infer
missing modalities -- both MR contrasts and CT images.

evolved into a new stage that we not only care about what to recommend, but why
it is recommended. Explainability of recommendations thus emerges as a focal
point of research and becomes extremely desired in e-commerce. Existent studies
along this line often exploit item attributes and correlations from different
perspectives, but they yet lack an effective way to combine both types of
information for deep learning of personalized interests. In light of this, we
propose a novel graph structure, \emph{attribute network}, based on both items'
co-purchase network and important attributes. A novel neural model called
\emph{eRAN} is then proposed to generate recommendations from attribute
networks with explainability and cold-start capability. Specifically, eRAN
first maps items connected in attribute networks to low-dimensional embedding
vectors through a deep autoencoder, and then an attention mechanism is applied
to model the attractions of attributes to users, from which personalized item
representation can be derived. Moreover, a pairwise ranking loss is constructed
into eRAN to improve recommendations, with the assumption that item pairs
co-purchased by a user should be more similar than those non-paired with
negative sampling in personalized view. Experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with some state-of-the-art
competitors. In particular, eRAN shows its unique abilities in recommending
cold-start items with higher accuracy, as well as in understanding user
preferences underlying complicated co-purchasing behaviors.

ecological ad-hoc measures that do not transfer to new service regions with
different characteristics. Here we derive a generic measure of ride-sharing

universal scaling law across network topologies. We demonstrate that the same
scaling holds across street networks of distinct topologies, including cities,
islands and rural areas, and is insensitive to modifying request distributions

in computer science with applications in many other fields, like natural

string matching is an efficient approach recently introduced in order to
overcome the prohibitive space requirements of an index construction, on the
one hand, and drastically reduce searching time for the online solutions, on
the other hand. In this paper we present a new algorithm for the sampled string
matching problem, based on a characters distance sampling approach. The main
idea is to sample the distances between consecutive occurrences of a given
pivot character and then to search online the sampled data for any occurrence
of the sampled pattern, before verifying the original text. From a theoretical
point of view we prove that, under suitable conditions, our solution can
achieve both linear worst-case time complexity and optimal average-time
complexity. From a practical point of view it turns out that our solution shows
a sub-linear behaviour in practice and speeds up online searching by a factor
of up to 9, using limited additional space whose amount goes from 11% to 2.8%

included experiences during the September 2017 space weather events, cross
domain impacts, timeliness of notifications, and provision of effective user

popular way to structure highly available, high performance, large-scale

between objects such systems often use distributed transactions with Two-Phase
Locking (2PL) for concurrency control and Two-Phase commit (2PC) as atomic
commitment protocol. Inquiry In highly available, high-throughput systems, such
as large banking infrastructure, however, 2PL becomes a bottleneck when objects
are highly contended, when an object is queuing a lot of messages because of
locking.
  Approach: In this paper we introduce Path-Sensitive Atomic Commit (PSAC) to
address this situation. We start from message handlers (or methods), which are
decorated with pre- and post-conditions, describing their guards and effect.
  Knowledge: This allows the PSAC lock mechanism to check whether the effect of
two incoming messages at the same time are independent, and to avoid locking if
this is the case. As a result, more messages are directly accepted or rejected,
and higher overall throughput is obtained.
  Grounding: We have implemented PSAC for a state machine-based DSL called
Rebel, on top of a runtime based on the Akka actor framework. Our performance
evaluation shows that PSAC exhibits the same scalability and latency
characteristics as standard 2PL/2PC, and obtains up to 1.8 times median higher
throughput in congested scenarios.
  Importance: We believe PSAC is a step towards enabling organizations to build
scalable distributed applications, even if their consistency requirements are
not embarrassingly parallel.

performance dynamics of mobile mmWave relaying is not nearly well explored,

measurement of various sun-induced phenomenon including coronal mass ejections
(CME), Forbush decreases, geomagnetic storms (GMS) and atmosphere acceleration
during the overhead passage of thunderclouds. However, the understanding and
interpretation of observed data requires Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of PCRs
and subsequent development of showers in the atmosphere. CORSIKA is a standard
MC simulation code widely used for this purpose. However, these simulations are
time consuming as large number of interactions and decays need to be taken into
account at various stages of shower development from top of the atmosphere down
to ground level. Therefore, computing resources become an important
consideration particularly when billion of PCRs need to be simulated to match
the high statistical accuracy of the data. During the GRAPES-3 simulations, it
was observed that over 60% of simulated events don't really reach the Earth's
atmosphere. The geomagnetic field (GMF) creates a threshold to PCRs called
cutoff rigidity Rc, a direction dependent parameter below which PCRs can't
reach the Earth's atmosphere. However, in CORSIKA there is no provision to set
a direction dependent threshold. We have devised an efficient method that has
taken into account of this Rc dependence. A reduction by a factor ~3 in
simulation time and ~2 in output data size was achieved for GRAPES-3
simulations. This has been incorporated in CORSIKA version v75600 onwards.
Detailed implementation of this along the potential benefits are discussed in

minimal subword complexity. In two papers, the first written by Morse and
Hedlund in 1940 and the second by Coven and Hedlund in 1973, a surprising
correspondence was established between Sturmian sequences on one side and
rotations by an irrational number on the unit circle on the other. In 1991
Arnoux and Rauzy observed that an induction process (invented by Rauzy in the
late 1970s), related with the classical continued fraction algorithm, can be
used to give a very elegant proof of this correspondence. This process, known
as the Rauzy induction, extends naturally to interval exchange transformations
(this is the setting in which it was first formalized). It has been conjectured
since the early 1990s that these correspondences carry over to rotations on
higher dimensional tori, generalized continued fraction algorithms, and
so-called $S$-adic sequences generated by substitutions. The idea of working
towards such a generalization is known as Rauzy's program. Recently Berth\'e,
Steiner, and Thuswaldner made some progress on Rauzy's program and were indeed
able to set up the conjectured generalization of the above correspondences.
Using a generalization of Rauzy's induction process in which generalized
continued fraction algorithms show up, they proved that under certain natural
conditions an $S$-adic sequence gives rise to a dynamical system which is
measurably conjugate to a rotation on a higher dimensional torus. Moreover,
they established a metric theory which shows that counterexamples like the one
constructed in 2000 by Cassaigne, Ferenczi, and Zamboni are rare. It is the aim
of the present chapter to survey all these ideas and results.

the statistical properties of such decision rules are rarely assessed. Such

simultaneous evaluation of multiple endpoints, complex multi-level models,
small sample sizes, and uncertainty in nuisance parameters. In response to

minimising the expected value of a loss function, defined over the whole

studying neutrino signals coincident with the gravitational wave events now
becomes an important mission for the existing neutrino experiments.
Unfortunately, no candidate neutrinos have been found yet. This article
introduces a method to find the neutrino excess to search for the potential
neutrinos from gravitational wave sources at the future reactor neutrino
experiment (such as JUNO and RENO-50). According to our calculations and
simulations, the non-detection of $\bar\nu_e$ associated with gravitational
waves at the nominal JUNO experiment gives rise to the $\bar\nu_e$ signal
sensitivity at 90$\%$ confidence level (C.L.), $\mu_{90}$ = 2.44. This
corresponds to the range of neutrino fluence on the Earth around 6 $\times$
10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ to 4 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ with neutrino energy
range from 1.8 MeV to 120 MeV at monochromatic energy spectrum assumption.
Based on certain popular models which describe the gravitational wave sources,
we calculate the corresponding fluence ($F_{UL}^{90}$), which is around 1 - 3
$\times$ 10$^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ for both monochromatic energy spectrum assumption
and Fermi-Dirac energy spectrum assumption. Then we convert $F_{UL}^{90}$ into
the detectable distance ($D_\text{UL}^{90}$), about 1 - 3 Mpc for two
assumptions, with the predicted luminosities in these known models. To further
improve the sensitivity, we discuss the potential benefits from an extra
detector, with different target masses and baselines. Particularly, there will
be around 38\% sensitivity improvement and around 28$\%$ detectable distance
increasing if the extra detector is designed to be identical to the JUNO
detector. On the other hand, instead of building an extra detector, if we
combine the JUNO experiment with the RENO-50 experiment, the sensitivity will
also be significantly improved.

the EP, an adaptive embedding pattern is introduced to enhance the competence
of algorithm for selectively embedding different bits of secret data into
pixels according to context information. Moreover, a novel two-level predictor
is designed by uniting two normal predictors for reducing the ED for embedding
more bits. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the previous
method, our scheme could significantly enhance the image fidelity while keeping

conventional shallow clustering algorithms. Deep clustering algorithms usually
combine representation learning with deep neural networks to achieve this
performance, typically optimizing a clustering and non-clustering loss. In such
cases, an autoencoder is typically connected with a clustering network, and the
final clustering is jointly learned by both the autoencoder and clustering
network. Instead, we propose to learn an autoencoded embedding and then search
this further for the underlying manifold. For simplicity, we then cluster this
with a shallow clustering algorithm, rather than a deeper network. We study a
number of local and global manifold learning methods on both the raw data and
autoencoded embedding, concluding that UMAP in our framework is best able to
find the most clusterable manifold in the embedding, suggesting local manifold
learning on an autoencoded embedding is effective for discovering higher
quality discovering clusters. We quantitatively show across a range of image
and time-series datasets that our method has competitive performance against
the latest deep clustering algorithms, including out-performing current
state-of-the-art on several. We postulate that these results show a promising

topological invariants and have been long ago proposed as a tool for 4d quantum
gravity. The Yetter lattice model and its continuum counterpart, the BFCG
theory, generalize BF theory to 2-gauge groups and -- when specialized to 4d
and the Poincar\'e 2-group -- they provide an exactly solvable
topologically-flat version of 4d general relativity. The 2-Poincar\'e Yetter
model was conjectured to be equivalent to a state sum model of quantum flat
spacetime developed by Baratin and Freidel after work by Korepanov (KBF model).
This conjecture was motivated by the origin of the KBF model in the theory of
2-representations of the Poincar\'e 2-group. Its proof, however, has remained
elusive due to the lack of a generalized Peter-Weyl theorem for 2-groups.
  In this work we prove this conjecture. Our proof avoids the Peter-Weyl
theorem and rather leverages the geometrical content of the Yetter model. Key
for the proof is the introduction of a kinematical boundary Hilbert space on
which 1- and 2-Lorentz invariance is imposed. Geometrically this allows the
identification of (quantum) tetrad variables and of the associated (quantum)
Levi-Civita connection. States in this Hilbert space are labelled by quantum
numbers that match the 2-group representation labels.
  Our results open exciting opportunities for the construction of new
representations of quantum geometries. Compared to loop quantum gravity, the
higher gauge theory framework provides a quantum representation of the
ADM-Regge initial data, including an identification of the intrinsic and
extrinsic curvature. Furthermore, it leads to a version of the diffeomorphism
and Hamiltonian constraints that acts on the vertices of the discretization,
thus providing a prospect for a quantum realization of the hypersurface
deformation algebra in 4d.

formation. As a toy model for this, we study type II critical collapse with two
matter fields in spherical symmetry, namely a scalar field and a Yang-Mills

that, for sufficiently good fine-tuning, the scalar field always dominates on
sufficiently small scales. We explain our results by the conjectured existence
of a ""quasi-discretely self-similar"" (QSS) solution shared by the two fields,
equal to the known Yang-Mills critical solution at infinitely large scales and
the known scalar field critical solution (the Choptuik solution) at infinitely

insulating phase at $x$ = 0 to the elusive half-metallic antiferromagnetic
(HMAFM) state with Sr doping at $x$ = 1. However, our detailed magnetic and
electrical measurements refute any kind of HMAFM possibility in either of the
doped samples. In addition, we establish that within these
Pr$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$MgIrO$_6$ double perovskites, changes in Ir-oxidation states
(4+ for PMIO to 5+ for PSMIO via mixed 4+/5+ for PSMIO1505) lead to markedly
different magnetic behaviors. While SOC on Ir is at the root of the observed
insulating behaviors for all three samples, the correlated magnetic properties
of these three compounds develop entirely due to the contribution from local Ir
moments. Additionally, the magnetic Pr$^{3+}$ (4$f^2$) ions, instead of showing
any kind of ordering, only contribute to the total paramagnetic moment. It is
seen that the PrSrMgIrO$_6$ sample does not order down to 2 K despite
antiferromagnetic interactions. But, the $d^5$ iridate Pr$_2$MgIrO$_6$ shows a
sharp antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at around 14 K, and in the mixed
valent Pr$_{1.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$MgIrO$_6$ sample the AFM transition is shifted to a
much lower temperature ($\sim$ 6 K) due to weakening of the AFM exchange.

each other via a so-called causal path. This causal topology is crucial to
understand dynamical processes, assess the role of nodes, or detect clusters.
However, we lack graph drawing techniques that incorporate this information
into static visualisations. Addressing this gap, we present a novel dynamic
graph visualisation algorithm that utilises higher-order graphical models of
causal paths in time series data to compute time-aware static graph
visualisations. These visualisations combine the simplicity and
interpretability of static graphs with a time-aware layout algorithm that
highlights patterns in the causal topology that result from the temporal

contributes towards the logit. The nomogram is a graphical representation of
these weights. We show that functions of individual and pairs of variables can
be derived from a functional Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) representation,
enabling an efficient feature selection to be carried by application of the
logistic Lasso. This process infers the structure of GANNs which otherwise
needs to be predefined. As this method is particularly suited for tabular data,
it starts by fitting a generic flexible model, in this case a Multi-layer
Perceptron (MLP) to which the ANOVA decomposition is applied. This has the
further advantage that the resulting GANN can be replicated as a SENN, enabling
further refinement of the univariate and bivariate component functions to take
place. The component functions are partial responses hence the SENN is a
partial response network. The Partial Response Network (PRN) is equally as
transparent as a traditional logistic regression model, but capable of
non-linear classification with comparable or superior performance to the

of the MLP, at the level of univariate and bivariate effects. The performance
of the PRN is shown to be competitive for benchmark data, against
state-of-the-art machine learning methods including GBM, SVM and Random

fundamental characteristics of rumor contagions and has profound influence on
public opinion formation. There has been growing interest in exploring
dynamical mechanisms of the competing evolutions recently. Nevertheless, the
impacts of population homophily, which determines powerful collective human
behaviors, remains unclear. In this paper, we incorporate homophily effects
into a modified competitive ignorant-spreader-ignorant (SIS) rumor diffusion
model with generalized population preference. Using microscopic Markov chain
approach, we first derive the phase diagram of competing diffusion results and
examine how competitive information spreads and evolves on social networks. We
then explore the detailed effects of homophily, which is modeled by a rewiring
mechanism. Results show that homophily promotes the formation of divided ""echo
chambers"" and protects the disadvantaged information from extinction, which
further changes or even reverses the evolutionary advantage, i.e., the
difference of final proportions of the competitive information. We highlight
the conclusion that the reversals may happen only when the initially
disadvantaged information has stronger transmission ability, owning diffusion
advantage over the other one. Our framework provides profound insight into
competing dynamics with population homophily, which may pave ways for further
controlling misinformation and guiding public belief systems. Moreover, the
reversing condition sheds light on designing effective competing strategies in
many real scenarios.

task that has required specialized machine learning and combinatorial
algorithms. We present an alternative method, universal access control policy
mining (Unicorn). We show how this method streamlines the design of policy
miners for a wide variety of policy languages including ABAC, RBAC, RBAC with

expressive fragment of XACML. For the latter two, there were no known policy

  To design a policy miner using Unicorn, one needs a policy language and a
metric quantifying how well a policy fits an assignment of permissions to
users. From these, one builds the policy miner as a search algorithm that
computes a policy that best fits the given permission assignment. We
experimentally evaluate the policy miners built with Unicorn on logs from
Amazon and access control matrices from other companies. Despite the genericity
of our method, our policy miners are competitive with and sometimes even better
than specialized state-of-the-art policy miners. The true positive rates of

envision such structure to arise from spatial ""lattice"" models (e.g. surface

protocells. Here we study the effect of turbulent motions in spatial models,
and propose that coherent structures, i.e. flow patterns which trap fluid and
arise naturally in turbulent flows, may serve many of the properties associated

Pseudo-task Regularization (PtR) which dynamically regularizes a network by

additional resources of data or prior domain expertise. In sum, the proposed
PtR provides: a) an alternative for network regularization without dependence
on the design of concrete regularization objectives or extra annotations; b) a
dynamically adjusted and maintained strength of regularization effect by
balancing the gradient norms between objectives on-line. Through numerous

occur in the flowing skyrmion lattice similar to those observed in the
compression dynamics of crystals. These transitions correspond to reductions in
the number of flowing rows of skyrmions due to the collective motion of the

clock to the one of a uniformly accelerating clock. We discover that there
exists a deviation from what the discrepancy between those rates is predicted
to be by special relativity. In a further part of this thesis we focus on the
family of two-mode Gaussian states of two localized modes of a given quantum
field. A general framework is developed for investigating the properties of
such states, when observed by two uniformly accelerated observers, having
access to another pair of localized modes. In particular, we focus on the
vacuum state and examine the amount of quantum entanglement perceived by the
observers. The framework is developed for three cases: the quantum scalar field
in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions and the Dirac spinor field in 1+1 dimensions. We find
that in general more entanglement is seen when the accelerations of the
observers increase and when the size of the modes of the observers and their
central frequencies decrease. Furthermore, we extend our attention also to
tripartite entanglement and investigate its extraction from the quantum vacuum
by three particle detectors in a cavity, interacting with a quantum field for a
finite time. Detailed maps of amounts of tripartite and bipartite entanglement
extracted by the detectors, are produced and compared between two types of
boundary conditions. It is found vacuum entanglement is most easily extracted

confused with robust optimization) of expensive noisy black-box functions
satisfying the Lipschitz condition is considered. The notion ""safe"" means that
the objective function $f(x)$ during optimization should not violate a ""safety""
threshold, for instance, a certain a priori given value $h$ in a maximization
problem. Thus, any new function evaluation (possibly corrupted by noise) must
be performed at ""safe points"" only, namely, at points $y$ for which it is known
that the objective function $f(y) > h$. The main difficulty here consists in
the fact that the used optimization algorithm should ensure that the safety
constraint will be satisfied at a point $y$ before evaluation of $f(y)$ will be
executed. Thus, it is required both to determine the safe region $\Omega$
within the search domain~$D$ and to find the global maximum within $\Omega$. An
additional difficulty consists in the fact that these problems should be solved
in the presence of the noise. This paper starts with a theoretical study of the
problem and it is shown that even though the objective function $f(x)$
satisfies the Lipschitz condition, traditional Lipschitz minorants and
majorants cannot be used due to the presence of the noise. Then, a
$\delta$-Lipschitz framework and two algorithms using it are proposed to solve
the safe global maximization problem. The first method determines the safe area
within the search domain and the second one executes the global maximization
over the found safe region. For both methods a number of theoretical results
related to their functioning and convergence is established. Finally, numerical
experiments confirming the reliability of the proposed procedures are
performed.

results show that the stratification effect on the plume width is significantly
lower than the effect on the vertical profiles. Stable stratification did not
affect the plume central axis inside the canopy, but in the unstable case the
axis appeared to deviate from the neutral case direction. Above the canopy both
stratification types caused an increase in the plume deflection angle compared
to the neutral case. Measured concentrations in stable stratification were up

Draconis, which was observed by XMM-Newton. Methods. We use wavelet and
autocorrelation techniques to identify the QPPs in a detrended version of the
flare. We also fit a model to the flare based on an exponential decay combined
with a decaying sinusoid. The flare is examined in multiple energy bands.
Results. A statistically significant QPP is observed in the X-ray energy band
of 0.2-12.0 keV with a periodicity of 76+/-2 min. When this energy band is
split, a statistically significant QPP is observed in the low-energy band
(0.2-1.0 keV) with a periodicity of 73+/-2 min and in the high-energy band
(1.0-12.0 keV) with a periodicity of 82+/-2 min. When fitting a model to the
time series the phases of the signals are also found to be significantly
different in the two energy bands (with a difference of 1.8+/-0.2 rad) and the
high-energy band is found to lead the low-energy band. Furthermore, the first
peak in the cross-correlation between the detrended residuals of the low- and
high-energy bands is offset from zero by more than 3{\sigma} (4.1+/-1.3 min).
Both energy bands produce statistically significant regions in the wavelet
spectrum, whose periods are consistent with those listed above. However, the
peaks are broad in both the wavelet and global power spectra, with the wavelet
showing evidence for a drift in period with time, and the difference in period
obtained is not significant. etc...

This testbed allows controlled experiments to stress-test CNN architectures

that: (1) There exists a limit to signal-to-noise below which CNNs fail to
generalize and that this limit is affected by dataset size - more data leading
to better performances; however, the amount of training data required for the

Meta-learning has shown strong performance in computer vision, where low-level
patterns are transferable across learning tasks. However, directly applying
this approach to text is challenging--lexical features highly informative for
one task may be insignificant for another. Thus, rather than learning solely
from words, our model also leverages their distributional signatures, which
encode pertinent word occurrence patterns. Our model is trained within a
meta-learning framework to map these signatures into attention scores, which
are then used to weight the lexical representations of words. We demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms prototypical networks learned on
lexical knowledge (Snell et al., 2017) in both few-shot text classification and
relation classification by a significant margin across six benchmark datasets
(20.0% on average in 1-shot classification).

however, is on bounds and asymptotics for the eigenvalues as functions of
$\alpha$: we start by providing estimates on the numerical range of the
associated operator, which lead to new eigenvalue bounds even in the case
$\alpha \in \mathbb R$. For the asymptotics of the eigenvalues as $\alpha \to
\infty$ in $\mathbb C$, in place of the min-max characterisation of the
eigenvalues and Dirichlet-Neumann bracketing techniques commonly used in the
real case, we exploit the duality between the eigenvalues of the Robin
Laplacian and the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We use this to
show that every Robin eigenvalue either diverges to $\infty$ in $\mathbb C$ or
converges to a point in the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian, and also to
give a comprehensive treatment of the special cases where $\Omega$ is an
interval, a hyperrectangle or a ball. This leads to the conjecture that on a
general smooth domain in dimension $d\geq 2$ all eigenvalues converge to the
Dirichlet spectrum if ${\rm Re}\, \alpha$ remains bounded from below as $\alpha
\to \infty$, while if ${\rm Re}\, \alpha \to -\infty$, then there is a family
of divergent eigenvalue curves, each of which behaves asymptotically like
$-\alpha^2$.

Unlike the solar dynamo models, it generates a strong toroidal magnetic field
by means of the thermomagnetic Ettingshausen-Nernst (EN) effect in the
tachocline. Hence, it can be shown that with the help of the thermomagnetic EN

the data originate from one process or contain subsets related to different
states of the data producing process. Data visualization tools should deliver a
clear picture of the univariate probability density distribution (PDF) for each
feature. Visualization tools for PDFs typically use kernel density estimates
and include both the classical histogram, as well as the modern tools like
ridgeline plots, bean plots and violin plots. If density estimation parameters
remain in a default setting, conventional methods pose several problems when
visualizing the PDF of uniform, multimodal, skewed distributions and
distributions with clipped data, For that reason, a new visualization tool
called the mirrored density plot (MD plot), which is specifically designed to
discover interesting structures in continuous features, is proposed. The MD
plot does not require adjusting any parameters of density estimation, which is
what may make the use of this plot compelling particularly to non-experts. The
visualization tools in question are evaluated against statistical tests with
regard to typical challenges of explorative distribution analysis. The results
of the evaluation are presented using bimodal Gaussian, skewed distributions
and several features with already published PDFs. In an exploratory data
analysis of 12 features describing quarterly financial statements, when
statistical testing poses a great difficulty, only the MD plots can identify
the structure of their PDFs. In sum, the MD plot outperforms the above
mentioned methods.

scene-motion, the fundamental matrix approach as a model for motion
segmentation still suffers from several defects, which we discuss in this
paper. The full potential of the fundamental matrix approach could only be
realized if we judiciously harness information from the simpler homography

underlying mechanisms that influence the spread of diseases and predicting
future disease progression. Modeling has been increasingly used to evaluate the
potential impact of different control measures and to guide public health
policy decisions. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in developing
spatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases and an example of such recent
developments is the discrete time individual-level models (ILMs). These models
are well developed and provide a common framework for modeling many disease
systems, however, they assume the probability of disease transmission between
two individuals depends only on their spatial separation and not on their
spatial locations. In cases where spatial location itself is important for
understanding the spread of emerging infectious diseases and identifying their
causes, it would be beneficial to incorporate the effect of spatial location in
the model. In this study, we thus generalize the ILMs to a new class of
geographically-dependent ILMs (GD-ILMs), to allow for the evaluation of the
effect of spatially varying risk factors (e.g., education, environmental), as
well as unobserved spatial structure, upon the transmission of infectious
disease. Specifically, we consider a conditional autoregressive model to
capture the effects of unobserved spatially structured latent covariates or
measurement error. This results in flexible infectious disease models that can
be used for formulating etiological hypotheses and identifying geographical
regions of unusually high risk to formulate preventive action. The reliability
of these models are investigated on a combination of simulated epidemic data
and Alberta seasonal influenza outbreak data (2009). This new class of models
is fitted to data within a Bayesian statistical framework using MCMC methods.

from unseen sources compared to the performance on data from the same source as
the training data. Semi-supervised domain adaptation methods can alleviate this
problem by tuning networks to new target domains without the need for annotated
data from these domains. Adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) methods are a
popular choice that aim to train networks in such a way that the features
generated are domain agnostic. However, these methods require careful
dataset-specific selection of hyperparameters such as the complexity of the
discriminator in order to achieve a reasonable performance. We propose to use
knowledge distillation (KD) -- an efficient way of transferring knowledge
between different DNNs -- for semi-supervised domain adaption of DNNs. It does
not require dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning, making it generally
applicable. The proposed method is compared to ADA for segmentation of white
matter hyperintensities (WMH) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
generated by scanners that are not a part of the training set. Compared with
both the baseline DNN (trained on source domain only and without any adaption
to target domain) and with using ADA for semi-supervised domain adaptation, the
proposed method achieves significantly higher WMH dice scores.

interpolation property is slightly weaker than universal approximation, and
disentangles supervised learning on finite training sets from generalization
properties. We also show that universal interpolation holds for certain deep
neural networks even if large numbers of parameters are left untrained, and are
instead chosen randomly. This lends theoretical support to the observation that
training with random initialization can be successful even when most parameters
are largely unchanged through the training. Our results also explore what a
minimal amount of trainable parameters in neural ordinary differential
equations could be without giving up on expressiveness.

document image analysis task. The state-of-the-art methods addressing the use
of degraded document image enhancement and denoising are mainly based on
applying filters. The most common filtering techniques applied to color images
in the literature may be categorized into four approaches: scalar, marginal,
vector and hybrid. To provide a set of comprehensive guidelines on the
strengths and weaknesses of these filtering approaches, a thorough comparative
study is proposed in this article. Numerical experiments are carried out in
this study on color archival document images to show and quantify the
performance of each assessed filtering approach.

wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. The fusion of multi-spectral
bands in the visible spectrum has been exploited to improve face recognition
performance over all the conventional broad band face images. In this book
chapter, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework which
adopts a structural sparsity learning technique to select the optimal spectral
bands to obtain the best face recognition performance over all of the spectral
bands. Specifically, in this method, images from all bands are fed to a CNN,
and the convolutional filters in the first layer of the CNN are then
regularized by employing a group Lasso algorithm to zero out the redundant
bands during the training of the network. Contrary to other methods which
usually select the useful bands manually or in a greedy fashion, our method
selects the optimal spectral bands automatically to achieve the best face
recognition performance over all spectral bands. Moreover, experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state of the art band selection methods
for face recognition on several publicly-available hyperspectral face image
datasets.

while preserving both global and local features with a sufficient level of

solution to this problem with a new data visualization method, TMAP, capable of
representing data sets of up to millions of data points and arbitrary high
dimensionality as a two-dimensional tree (http://tmap.gdb.tools).
Visualizations based on TMAP are better suited than t-SNE or UMAP for the
exploration and interpretation of large data sets due to their tree-like
nature, increased local and global neighborhood and structure preservation, and
the transparency of the methods the algorithm is based on. We apply TMAP to the
most used chemistry data sets including databases of molecules such as ChEMBL,
FDB17, the Natural Products Atlas, DSSTox, as well as to the MoleculeNet
benchmark collection of data sets. We also show its broad applicability with
further examples from biology, particle physics, and literature.

scattering geometry of Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) experiments,
the shear distortion effects inherent to the resulting three-dimensional (3D)
image from current phase retrieval methods and strategies to mitigate this
distortion. In this Part I, we derive in general terms the real-space
coordinate transformation to correct this shear, which originates in the more
fundamental relationship between the representations of mutually conjugate 3D
spaces. Such a transformation, applied as a final post-processing step
following phase retrieval, is crucial for arriving at an un-distorted and
physically meaningful image of the 3D scatterer. As the relevance of BCDI grows
in the field of materials characterization, we take this opportunity to
generalize the available sparse literature that addresses the geometric theory
of BCDI and the subsequent analysis methods. This aspect, specific to coherent
Bragg diffraction and absent in two-dimensional transmission CDI experiments,
gains particular importance concerning spatially-resolved characterization of
3D crystalline materials in a realiable, non-destructive manner. These articles
describe this theory, from the diffraction in Bragg geometry, to the
corrections needed to obtain a properly rendered digital image of the 3D
scatterer. Part I provides the experimental BCDI communitcy with the
theoretical underpinnings of the 3D real-space distortions in the
phase-retrieved object, along with the necessary post-retrieval correction
method. Part II builds upon the geometric theory developed in Part I with the
formalism to correct the shear distortions directly on an orthogonal grid
within the phase retrieval algorithm itself, allowing more physically realistic
constraints to be applied.

  Bragg coherent diffraction imaging: Part 2","37 pages (double spaced), 4 figures, under review",,,,"physics.ins-det eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  X-ray Bragg coherent diffraction imaging has been demonstrated as a powerful
three-dimensional (3D) microscopy approach for the investigation of
sub-micrometer-scale crystalline particles. It is based on the measurement of a
series of coherent diffraction intensity patterns that are numerically inverted
to retrieve an image of the spatial distribution of relative phase and
amplitude of the Bragg structure factor of the scatterer. This 3D information,
which is collected through an angular rotation of the sample, is necessarily
obtained in a non-orthogonal frame in Fourier space that must be eventually
reconciled. To deal with this, the currently favored approach (detailed in Part
I) is to perform the entire inversion in conjugate non-orthogonal real and
Fourier space frames, and to transform the 3D sample image into an orthogonal
frame as a post-processing step for result analysis. In this article, a direct
follow-up of Part I, we demonstrate two different transformation strategies
that enable the entire inversion procedure of the measured data set to be
performed in an orthogonal frame. The new approaches described here build
mathematical and numerical frameworks that apply to the cases of evenly and
non-evenly sampled data along the direction of sample rotation (the rocking
curve). The value of these methods is that they rely on and incorporate
significantly more information about the experimental geometry into the design
of the phase retrieval Fourier transformation than the strategy presented in
Part I. Two important outcomes are 1) that the resulting sample image is
correctly interpreted in a shear-free frame, and 2) physically realistic
constraints of BCDI phase retrieval that are difficult to implement with
current methods are easily incorporated. Computing scripts are also given to
aid readers in the implementation of the proposed formalisms.
