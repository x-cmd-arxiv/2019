current or emerging applications, such as radiation shielding design and
radiation transport analyses, calculations of absorbed dose in the human body
during radiotherapy, physics and technology of fission reactors (influence of
photo-reactions on neutron balance) and fusion reactors (plasma diagnostics and
shielding), activation analyses, safeguards and inspection technologies,
nuclear waste transmutation, medical isotope production and astrophysical
applications.
  Since the release of the IAEA Photonuclear Data Library in 1999 however, new
experimental data as well as new methods to assess the reliability of
experimental cross sections have become available. Theoretical models and input
parameters used to evaluate photo-induced reactions have improved significantly
over the years. In addition, new measurements of partial photoneutron cross
sections using mono-energetic photon beams and advanced neutron detection
systems have been performed allowing for the validation of the evaluations and
assessments of the experimental data. Furthermore, technological advances have
led to the construction of new and more powerful gamma-beam facilities,
therefore new data needs are emerging.
  We report our coordinated efforts to address these data needs and present the
results of the new evaluations of more than 200 nuclides included in the new
updated IAEA Photonuclear Data Library, where the photon energy goes up to 200
MeV. We discuss the new assessment method and make recommendations to the user
community in cases where the experimental data are discrepant and the
assessments disagree. In addition, in the absence of experimental data, we
present model predictions for photo-induced reaction cross section on nuclides
of potential interest to medical radioisotope production.

been historically studied at several different points in the curriculum

multi-variable integration at two new points in the curriculum: middle-division
classical mechanics, and upper-division magnetostatics. To facilitate
comparisons across prior studies as well as the current work, we utilize an
analytical framework that focuses on how students activate, construct, execute,
and reflect on mathematical tools during physics problem solving (i.e., the
ACER framework). Using a mixed-methods approach involving coded exam solutions
and student problem-solving interviews, we identify and compare students'
difficulties in these two different context and relate them to what has been
found previously in other levels and contexts. We find that some of the
observed student difficulties were persistent accross all three contexts (e.g.,
identifying integration as the appropriate tool, and expressing the difference
vector), while other difficulties seemed to fade as students advanced through
the curriculum (e.g., expressing differential line, area, and volume elements).
We also identified new difficulties that appear in different contexts (e.g.,
interpreting and expressing the current density).

and extensions, accurate estimation of extreme states is often of great
importance. When the observations used are uncertain, however, KF suffers from
conditional bias (CB) which results in consistent under- and overestimation of
extremes in the right and left tails, respectively. Recently, CB-penalized KF,
or CBPKF, has been developed to address CB. In this paper, we present an
alternative formulation based on variance-inflated KF to reduce computation and
algorithmic complexity, and describe adaptive implementation to improve
unconditional performance. For theoretical basis and context, we also provide a
complete self-contained description of CB-penalized Fisher-like estimation and
CBPKF. The results from 1-dimensional synthetic experiments for a linear system
with varying degrees of nonstationarity show that adaptive CBPKF reduces root
mean square error at the extreme tail ends by 20 to 30% over KF while
performing comparably to KF in the unconditional sense. The alternative
formulation is found to approximate the original formulation very closely while
reducing computing time to 1.5 to 3.5 times of that for KF depending on the
dimensionality of the problem. Adaptive CBPKF hence offers a significant
addition to the dynamic filtering methods for general application in signal
processing when accurate estimation of extremes is of importance.

angle of just over one degree near the surface. This focuses light onto a focal
line starting at an inner (and chromatic) boundary out to infinity - offering
an opportunity for pronounced lensing. It is shown here that the focal line
commences at ~85% of the Earth-Moon separation, and thus placing an orbiting
detector between here and one Hill radius could exploit this refractive lens.
Analytic estimates are derived for a source directly behind the Earth (i.e.
on-axis) showing that starlight is lensed into a thin circular ring of
thickness $W H_{\Delta}/R$, yielding an amplification of $8 H_{\Delta}/W$,
where $H_{\Delta}$ is the Earth's refractive scale height, $R$ is its
geopotential radius and $W$ is the detector diameter. These estimates are
verified through numerical ray-tracing experiments from optical to 30 micron
light with standard atmospheric models. The numerical experiments are extended
to include extinction from both a clear atmosphere and one with clouds. It is
found that a detector at one Hill radius is least affected by extinction since
lensed rays travel no deeper than 13.7 km, within the stratosphere and above
most clouds. Including extinction, a 1 metre Hill radius 'terrascope' is
calculated to produce an amplification of ~45,000 for a lensing timescale of
~20 hours. In practice, the amplification is likely halved in order to avoid
daylight scattering i.e. 22,500 ($\Delta$mag=10.9) for $W=$1 metre, or
equivalent to a 150 metre optical/infrared telescope.

ongoing. Machine learning approaches are intensely being applied to this
problem due to their ability to classify seizure conditions from a large amount
of data, and provide pre-screened results for neurologists. Several features,
data transformations, and classifiers have been explored to analyze and
classify seizures via EEG signals. In the literature, some jointly-applied
features used in the classification may have shared similar contributions,
making them redundant in the learning process. Therefore, this paper aims to
comprehensively summarize feature descriptions and their interpretations in
characterizing epileptic seizures using EEG signals, as well as to review
classification performance metrics. To provide meaningful information of
feature selection, we conducted an experiment to examine the quality of each
feature independently. The Bayesian error and non-parametric probability
distribution estimation were employed to determine the significance of the
individual features. Moreover, a redundancy analysis using a correlation-based
feature selection was applied. The results showed that the following features

wavelet coefficients-- were able to significantly capture the seizures. An

sparsity-constrained optimization comes into play. In general, optimizing
objective functions with sparsity constraints is NP-hard because of their

within the Higgs induced right-handed (RH) neutrino mixing model, solving the
associated density matrix equation. For a benchmark value of the dark matter
mass $M_{\rm DM} = 220\,{\rm TeV}$, we show the evolution of the abundance and
how this depends on reheat temperature, dark matter lifetime and source RH
neutrino mass $M_{\rm S}$, with the assumption $M_{\rm S} < M_{\rm DM}$. We
compare the results with those obtained within the Landau-Zener approximation,
showing that the latter largely overestimates the final abundance giving some
analytical insight. However, we also notice that since in the density matrix
formalism the production is non-resonant, this allows source RH neutrino masses
below the W boson mass, making dark matter more stable at large mass values.
This opens an allowed region for initial vanishing source RH neutrino
abundance. For example, for $M_{\rm S} \gtrsim 1\,{\rm GeV}$, we find $M_{\rm
DM}\gtrsim 20\,{\rm PeV}$. Otherwise, for $M_{\rm S} > M_W\sim 100\,{\rm GeV}$,
one has to assume a thermalisation of the source RH neutrinos prior to the
freeze-in of the dark matter abundance. This results into a large allowed range
for $M_{\rm DM}$, depending on $M_{\rm S}$. For example, imposing $M_{\rm S}
\gtrsim 300\,{\rm GeV}$, allowing also successful leptogenesis, we find $0.5
\lesssim M_{\rm DM}/{\rm TeV} \lesssim 500$. We also discuss in detail
leptogenesis with two quasi-degenerate RH neutrinos, showing a case when
observed dark matter abundance and matter-antimatter asymmetry are
simultaneously reproduced. Finally, we comment on how an initial thermal source
RH neutrino abundance can be justified and on how our results suggest that also
the interesting case where $M_{\rm DM} < M_{\rm S}$, embeddable in usual high
scale two RH neutrino seesaw models, might be viable.

assurance that provides safety guarantees for neural controllers (obtained e.g.

unduly sacrificing performance. NSA is inspired by the Simplex control
architecture of Sha et al., but with some significant differences. In the
traditional approach, the advanced controller (AC) is treated as a black box;
when the decision module switches control to the baseline controller (BC), the
BC remains in control forever. There is relatively little work on switching
control back to the AC, and there are no techniques for correcting the AC's
behavior after it generates a potentially unsafe control input that causes a
failover to the BC. Our NSA addresses both of these limitations. NSA not only
provides safety assurances in the presence of a possibly unsafe neural
controller, but can also improve the safety of such a controller in an online
setting via retraining, without overly degrading its performance. To
demonstrate NSA's benefits, we have conducted several significant case studies
in the continuous control domain. These include a target-seeking ground rover
navigating an obstacle field, and a neural controller for an artificial

increase film lifetime at high molecular weights and high concentrations,

the ideal concentration of polymer additives for making giant bubbles requires
a robust viscoelastic rheology during extension, and is aided by long film

$\sim0.64$ keV and $\sim6.4$ keV that correspond to O and Fe, respectively. By
modeling these line components, we are able to track changes in the accretion
disk throughout this period. The innermost accretion flow appears to move
inwards from hundreds of gravitational radii ($R_{g}=GM/c^{2}$) at the
beginning of the outburst to $<8.7$ $R_{g}$ at peak intensity. We do not detect
the source in radio, but are able to place a $3\sigma$ upper limit on the flux
density at $27$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Comparing the radio and X-ray
luminosities, we find that the source lies significantly away from the range
typical of black holes in the ${L}_{{r}}$-${L}_{{x}}$ plane, suggesting a
neutron star (NS) primary. This adds to the evidence that NSs do not follow a
single track in the ${L}_{{r}}$-${L}_{{x}}$ plane, limiting its use in
distinguishing between different classes of NSs based on radio and X-ray
observations alone.

the isomers for a given molecule. Many classical search methods have been
developed in order to tackle this problem. However, the availability of quantum
computing architectures has given us the opportunity to address this problem
with new (quantum) techniques. This paper describes a quantum isomer search
procedure for determining all the structural isomers of alkanes. We first
formulate the structural isomer search problem as a quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The QUBO formulation is for general use on
either annealing or gate-based quantum computers. We use the D-Wave quantum
annealer to enumerate all structural isomers of all alkanes with fewer carbon
atoms (n < 10) than Decane (C10H22). The number of isomer solutions increases
with the number of carbon atoms. We find that the sampling time needed to
identify all solutions scales linearly with the number of carbon atoms in the
alkane. We probe the problem further by employing reverse annealing as well as
a perturbed QUBO Hamiltonian and find that the combination of these two methods
significantly reduces the number of samples required to find all isomers.

However, the physical processes that mold the extreme high and low density

a simple model for turbulence by treating it as a continuous Markov process,

The multiplicity of classical Cepheids (CCs) and RR Lyrae stars

aim is to detect the wide, spatially resolved companions of the targets of our
reference samples of Galactic CCs and RRLs. Methods. Angularly resolved common
proper motion pairs were detected using a simple progressive selection
algorithm to separate the most probable candidate companions from the unrelated
field stars. Results. We found 27 resolved, high probability gravitationally
bound systems with CCs out of 456 examined stars, and one unbound star embedded
in the circumstellar dusty nebula of the long-period Cepheid RS Pup. We found
seven spatially resolved, probably bound systems with RRL primaries out of 789
investigated stars, and 22 additional candidate pairs. We report in particular
new companions of three bright RRLs: OV And (companion of F4V spectral type),
RR Leo (M0V), and SS Oct (K2V). In addition, we discovered resolved companions
of 14 stars that were likely misclassified as RRLs. Conclusions. The detection
of resolved non-variable companions around CCs and RRLs facilitates the
validation of their Gaia DR2 parallaxes. The possibility to conduct a detailed

$M_{*}=10^{10.4-11}M_{\odot}$, of which 40 per cent are barred. Of the detected
bars, more than half are strong. We find that the fraction of barred galaxies
increases with stellar mass, in agreement with observational results. Strongly
barred galaxies exhibit, overall, lower gas-to-stellar mass ratios compared to
unbarred galaxies. The majority of barred galaxies are quenched (sSFR
$\sim10^{-11.7} $yr$^{-1}$), whereas unbarred galaxies continue to be active
(sSFR $\sim10^{-10.3}$yr$^{-1}$) on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies.
We explore the evolution of strongly barred and unbarred galaxies to
investigate their formation and quenching histories. We find that strong bars
form between $0.5< z< 1.5$, with more massive galaxies hosting older bars.
Strong bars form in galaxies with an early-established prominent disc
component, undergoing periods of enhanced star formation and black hole
accretion, possibly assisted by cosmological inflows. Unbarred galaxies, on the
other hand, assemble most of their mass and disc component at late times. The
nuclear region of strongly barred galaxies quenches shortly after bar
formation, while unbarred galaxies remain active across time. Our findings are
indicative of bar quenching, possibly assisted by nuclear feedback processes.
  We conclude that the cosmological environment, together with small scale
feedback processes, determine the chances of a galaxy to form a bar and to
rapidly quench its central region.

Previously, only smaller, PI-led missions have had core programs that used such

models in which the effective star formation efficiency within haloes is a
function of mass (or virial temperature) and independent of time. Despite its
simplicity, the model reproduces self-consistently the shape and evolution of

threshold for the value of impinging velocity, v*, below which penetration is
not observed which depends on size of the surface roughness. This indicates
grooves smaller than a certain size can stop water from penetration,
considering v~0.5M in practical situations, which is such a useful information
for design of nanostructured ice-phobic substrates. The resistance presumably
comes from interfacial tension between solid substrate and liquid water

higher than V*. Our result indicates the dominant role of droplet temperature
on time required droplet recede from surface groove structure rather than

reveal that for small $\left|S\right|$, $T_{r}$ is linear in $S$ with positive

$T_{r}$ is proportional to $\left|S\right|^{-1/2}$ for both positive and

follows the $|S|^{-1/2}$ scaling and can be interpreted in terms of solitons,
as in the case of the KdV equation for the $\alpha$ chain. The difference in
the multiplicative factors between positive and negative $\beta$ arises from
soliton-kink interactions which exist only in the negative $\beta$ case. We

its cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA). The family is parameterized by
partitions of the quiver into Dynkin subquivers. For each such partition, we
write the domain of our isomorphism as a tensor product of subalgebras in two
ways. In the first, each tensor factor is isomorphic to the CoHA of the quiver
with a single vertex and no arrows. In the second, the tensor factors are each
isomorphic to the CoHAs of the corresponding Dynkin subquivers. When the quiver
is already an orientation of a simply-laced Dynkin diagram, our results
interpolate between isomorphisms proved by Rimanyi. Such CoHA decompositions
appear in prior work of Davison--Meinhardt and Franzen--Reineke, but our proof
gives an explicit topological realization of these results. As a consequence of
our method, we deduce that certain structure constants in the CoHA naturally
arise as CoHA products of classes of Dynkin quiver polynomials.

the steady-state distribution and the particle's dynamics subject to disorder

its tumbling rate. We show that in the case of a disordered potential, the
behavior is like an equilibrium particle diffusing on a random force landscape,
implying a dynamics that is logarithmically slow in time. In the situations of
disorder in the speed or tumbling rate, we find that the particle generically
exhibits diffusive motion, although particular choices of the disorder may lead
to anomalous diffusion. Based on the single-particle results, we find that in a
system with many interacting particles, disorder in the potential leads to
strong clustering. We characterize the clustering in two different regimes

coatings the Casimir pressure and pressure gradient are determined by the mean
of the equilibrium contributions calculated at temperatures of the two plates
and by the term independent on separation. Numerical computations of the
nonequilibrium pressures are performed for two parallel Au plates of finite
thickness as a function of separation and temperature of one of the plates
using the plasma and Drude models for extrapolation of the optical data of Au
to low frequencies. The obtained results essentially depend on the
extrapolation used. Modifications of the CANNEX setup, originally developed to
measure the Casimir pressure and pressure gradient in thermal equilibrium, are
suggested, which allow different temperatures of one of the plates.
Computations of the nonequilibrium pressure and pressure gradient are performed

only a 10~K difference in temperature between the plates, the experiment could
discriminate between different theoretical predictions for the total pressure

for modeling macromolecular natural modes at a variety of scales. In this

are revealed by de Rham-Hodge spectral analysis. By using the Helmholtz-Hodge

divergence-free, curl-free, and harmonic components with a distinct physical
interpretation. We organize the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 0-form
Laplace-de Rham operator into one of the most accurate protein B-factor
predictors. By combining the 1-form Laplace-de Rham operator and the
Helfrich-type curvature energy, we predict the natural modes of both X-ray

developments, cryo-EM was selected by Nature Methods as Method of the Year
2015, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2017 was awarded to three pioneers in
the field.
  The main goal of this article is to introduce the challenging and exciting
computational tasks involved in reconstructing 3-D molecular structures by
cryo-EM. Determining molecular structures requires a wide range of
computational tools in a variety of fields, including signal processing,
estimation and detection theory, high-dimensional statistics, convex and
non-convex optimization, spectral algorithms, dimensionality reduction, and
machine learning. The tools from these fields must be adapted to work under
exceptionally challenging conditions, including extreme noise levels, the
presence of missing data, and massively large datasets as large as several
Terabytes.
  In addition, we present two statistical models: multi-reference alignment and
multi-target detection, that abstract away much of the intricacies of cryo-EM,
while retaining some of its essential features. Based on these abstractions, we
discuss some recent intriguing results in the mathematical theory of cryo-EM,
and delineate relations with group theory, invariant theory, and information
theory.

associated part semantics and structure is central to many applications
requiring high-quality 3D assets or large volumes of realistic training data. A
key challenge towards this goal is how to accommodate diverse shape variations,
including both continuous deformations of parts as well as structural or
discrete alterations which add to, remove from, or modify the shape
constituents and compositional structure. Such object structure can typically
be organized into a hierarchy of constituent object parts and relationships,
represented as a hierarchy of n-ary graphs. We introduce StructureNet, a
hierarchical graph network which (i) can directly encode shapes represented as
such n-ary graphs; (ii) can be robustly trained on large and complex shape
families; and (iii) can be used to generate a great diversity of realistic
structured shape geometries. Technically, we accomplish this by drawing
inspiration from recent advances in graph neural networks to propose an
order-invariant encoding of n-ary graphs, considering jointly both part
geometry and inter-part relations during network training. We extensively
evaluate the quality of the learned latent spaces for various shape families
and show significant advantages over baseline and competing methods. The
learned latent spaces enable several structure-aware geometry processing
applications, including shape generation and interpolation, shape editing, or
shape structure discovery directly from un-annotated images, point clouds, or
partial scans.

orthogonal categories of layout strategies are proposed in the literature:
order dimensions by similarity to get homogeneously shaped glyphs vs. order by
dissimilarity to emphasize spikes and salient shapes. While there is evidence
that salient shapes support clustering tasks, evaluation, and direct comparison

We experimentally demonstrate this method with orbital angular momentum states
of photons. In our experiment, the quantum state tomography measurements are as
simple as taking a photograph with a camera. We experimentally verify our
method with near-pure- and mixed-states of orbital angular momentum with
dimension up to $d=13$, and achieve greater than 95 % state fidelities for all
states tested. This method dramatically reduces the complexity of measurements
for full quantum state tomography, and shows potential application in various
high dimensional quantum information tasks.

framework of active rotational diffusion. Just like active colloids, their
trajectories can be modeled with a constant velocity $V$ and a slow angular
diffusion, but the random changes in direction are not thermally driven.
Instead, $V$ is determined by the interfacial tension gradient along the
droplet surface, while local micellar fluctuations lead to droplet
reorientation with a persistence time $\tau$. We show that the origin of
locomotion is the difference in the critical micellar concentration $\Delta$CMC
in the front and the back of the droplet. Tuning this parameter by salt
controls $V$ from $3-15$ diameters $d/s$. Surfactant concentration has little
effect on speed, but leads to a dramatic decrease in $\tau$ over four orders of
magnitude. The corresponding range of the effective diffusion constant $D_e$
extends beyond the realm of synthetic or living swimmers, in which $V$ is
limited by fuel consumption and $\tau$ is set by temperature or biological
activity, respectively. Our tunable swimmers are ideal candidates for the study
of the departure from equilibrium to high levels of activity, on both the

tomographic image reconstruction methods. In photoacoustic tomography, these
algorithms are based on theoretically exact analytic inversion formulas which
results in accurate reconstructions. However, photoacoustic measurement data
are often incomplete (limited detection view and sparse sampling), which
results in artefacts in the images reconstructed with FBP. In addition to that,
properties such as directivity of the acoustic detectors are not accounted for
in standard FBP, which affects the reconstruction quality, too. To account for
these issues, in this papers we propose to improve FBP algorithms based on
machine learning techniques. In the proposed method, we include additional
weight factors in the FBP, that are optimized on a set of incomplete data and
the corresponding ground truth photoacoustic source. Numerical tests show that
the learned FBP improves the reconstruction quality compared to the standard
FBP.

characterization of pyrochlore materials. The experiment consisted of
measurements of the dependence of the impedance of such systems with the
temperature during heating (25 to 110 {\deg}C) and cooling (110 to 25 {\deg}C).
The goal was to try to avoid the effect of humidity in the impedance spectrum.
However, for the sample with x = 0.20, we get an anomalous response of the
conductivity during the cooling process. To explain this result, we performed
micro-structure characterization in this sample and in the samples with x =
0.80 and 0.67. The result is that the sample with x = 0.20 is well
characterized by the model ""easy-path"" because it has high porosity while the
other two must have phase precipitate structure type Suzuki. These results
served to explain why the anomaly on the Arrhenius plot occurred only in the
0.20 concentration sample: microstructure difference. In this study we can also
note that the doped samples had a dependence of activation energies related to
the rates of concentration. Except for the sample with concentration rate of
0.20, the activation energies during cooling are among the values of 0.60 and
0.23 eV of their pure counterparts which are registered in the literature.

Previous publications demonstrated that ScEMT improved the prediction of DC

composite resonant frequency is presented and compared to MGT, CMA models and
measurement. Model and measurement comparisons of resonant frequency are

represent improvement over the CMA and MGT models. ScEMT modifications to
Schlomann show overall best agreement with relaxation frequency measurement.

SecureReqNet, for automatically identifying whether issues in software issue
tracking systems describe security-related content. Our approach consists of a
two-phase neural net architecture that operates purely on the natural language
descriptions of issues. The first phase of our approach learns high dimensional
word embeddings from hundreds of thousands of vulnerability descriptions listed
in the CVE database and issue descriptions extracted from open source projects.
The second phase then utilizes the semantic ontology represented by these
embeddings to train a convolutional neural network capable of predicting
whether a given issue is security-related. We evaluated SecureReqNet by
applying it to identify security-related issues from a dataset of thousands of
issues mined from popular projects on GitLab and GitHub. In addition, we also
applied our approach to identify security-related requirements from a
commercial software project developed by a major telecommunication company. Our
preliminary results are encouraging, with SecureReqNet achieving an accuracy of
96% on open source issues and 71.6% on industrial requirements.

quantum radiometry as metrology standard for photon fluxes at the low light

range, sub-Poissonian photon statistics and narrow-band emission spectrum. In
this work, a monochromatic single-photon source based on an organic dye
molecule is presented, whose photon flux is traceably measured to be adjustable
between 144 000 and 1320 000 photons per second at a wavelength of (785.6 +/-
0.1) nm, corresponding to an optical radiant flux between 36.5 fW and 334 fW.
The high purity of the single-photon stream is verified, with a second-order
autocorrelation function at zero time delay below 0.1 throughout the whole
range. Featuring an appropriate combination of emission properties, the
molecular SPS shows here application in the calibration of a silicon
Single-Photon Avalanche Detector (SPAD) against a low-noise analog silicon
photodiode traceable to the primary standard for optical radiant flux (i.e. the
cryogenic radiometer). Due to the narrow bandwidth of the source, corrections
to the SPAD detection efficiency arising from the spectral power distribution
are negligible. With this major advantage, the developed device may finally
realize a low-photon-flux standard source for quantum radiometry.

Basket trials are designed to enroll multiple clinical subpopulations to which
it is assumed that the therapy in question offers beneficial efficacy in the
presence of the targeted molecular profile. The treatment, however, may not
offer acceptable efficacy to all subpopulations enrolled. Moreover, for rare
disease settings, such as oncology wherein these trials have become popular,
marginal measures of statistical evidence are difficult to interpret for
sparsely enrolled subpopulations. Consequently, basket trials pose challenges
to the traditional paradigm for trial design, which assumes inter-patient
exchangeability. The R-package \pkg{basket} facilitates the analysis of basket
trials by implementing multi-source exchangeability models. By evaluating all
possible pairwise exchangeability relationships, this hierarchical modeling
framework facilitates Bayesian posterior shrinkage among a collection of
discrete and pre-specified subpopulations. Analysis functions are provided to
implement posterior inference of the response rates and all possible
exchangeability relationships between subpopulations. In addition, the package

makes progress on this sub-problem by showing that the preconditioner stability
$\|\boldsymbol{I}-\boldsymbol{M}^{-1}\boldsymbol{A}\|_\mathsf{F}$, known to
forecast preconditioner quality, can be computed in the time it takes to run a
constant number of iterations of conjugate gradients through use of sketching
methods. This is in spite of folklore which suggests the quantity is

use no preconditioner at all if none of the candidates appears useful. The

  Equations",,,,,"math.OC cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We generalize the Rayleigh quotient iteration to a class of functions called
vector Lagrangians. The convergence theorem we obtained generalizes classical
and nonlinear Rayleigh quotient iterations, as well as iterations for tensor
eigenpairs and constrained optimization. In the latter case, our generalized
Rayleigh quotient is an estimate of the Lagrange multiplier. We discuss two
methods of solving the updating equation associated with the iteration. One
method leads to a generalization of Riemannian Newton method for embedded
manifolds in a Euclidean space while the other leads to a generalization of the
classical Rayleigh quotient formula. Applying to tensor eigenpairs, we obtain
both an improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithm, and a new
quadratically convergent algorithm to compute all complex eigenpairs of sizes
typical in applications. We also obtain a Rayleigh-Chebyshev iteration with
cubic convergence rate, and give a clear criterion for RQI to have cubic
convergence rate, giving a common framework for existing algorithms.

on prior work that considers graph-based trajectories to find solutions in
multiple homotopy classes concurrently. Specifically, we extend this previous
work to an online setting where the unreachable (in time) part of the graph is
pruned and the remaining graph is reoptimized at every time step. As the robot
moves within the graph on the path that is most promising, the pruning and
reoptimization allows us to retain candidate paths that may become more viable
in the future as the environment changes, essentially enabling the robot to
dynamically switch between numerous homotopy classes. We compare our approach
against prior work without the homotopy switching capability and show improved
performance across several metrics in simulation with a 2D robot in multiple

generation costs, mini-grids are transforming into hybrid systems with a mix of
renewables, energy storage, and diesel-generation. Optimal design of hybrid
mini-grid requires an understanding of both the economic and power quality
impacts of different designs. Existing approaches to modeling distributed
energy resources address the economic viability and power quality impacts via
separate/loosely coupled models. Here, we extend REopt - a techno-economic
optimization model developed at National Renewable Energy Laboratory - to
consider both within a single model. REopt formulates the design problem as a
mixed-integer linear program that solves a deterministic optimization problem
for a site's optimal technology mix, sizing, and operation to minimize life
cycle cost. REopt has traditionally not constrained the power injection based
on power quality. In the work presented here, we expand the REopt platform to
consider multiple connected nodes. In order to do this, we model power flow
using a fixed-point linear approximation method. Resulting system sizes and
voltage magnitudes are validated against the base REopt model, and solutions of
established power flow models respectively. We then use the model to explore
design considerations of mini-grids in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, we
evaluate under what combinations of line length and line capacity it is
economically beneficial (or technically required based on voltage limits) to
build isolated mini-grids versus an interconnected system that benefits from
the economies of scale associated with a single, centralized generation system.

approximations. The analysis includes the angular momentum projection
degeneracies and linear or circular polarization of the exciting field.
Expressions are derived for the rate of two-photon power loss for light inside
a resonant cavity. Explicit calculations are made for excitation of the $\nu_3$

spectrum is dominated by a single $v_3 = 0 \rightarrow 2, Q(16)$ line at

of 32\,ppq ($10^{-15}$) Hz$^{-1/2}$ for $^{12}\textrm{C}^{16}\textrm{O}_2$,
higher sensitivity than has been realized using one-photon absorption. The
analysis predicts that most polyatomic molecules will have sparse, Doppler-Free
two-photon absorption spectra, which will dramatically increase the selectivity
of trace gas detection of samples with multiple components with overlapping
absorption bands. This is demonstrated by the predicted mid-IR two-photon

large-scale fields ($\propto r^{-2}$) at the inner disk regions, either if the

provides an opportunity to test the in-situ gas accretion scenario against disk

technique at the single-cell resolution. Appropriate analysis of scRNA-seq data
can characterize molecular heterogeneity and shed light into the underlying
cellular process to better understand development and disease mechanisms. The
unique analytic challenge is to appropriately model highly over-dispersed
scRNA-seq count data with prevalent dropouts (zero counts), making
zero-inflated dimensionality reduction techniques popular for scRNA-seq data
analyses. Employing zero-inflated distributions, however, may place extra
emphasis on zero counts, leading to potential bias when identifying the latent
structure of the data. Results: In this paper, we propose a fully generative
hierarchical gamma-negative binomial (hGNB) model of scRNA-seq data, obviating
the need for explicitly modeling zero inflation. At the same time, hGNB can
naturally account for covariate effects at both the gene and cell levels to
identify complex latent representations of scRNA-seq data, without the need for
commonly adopted pre-processing steps such as normalization. Efficient Bayesian
model inference is derived by exploiting conditional conjugacy via novel data
augmentation techniques. Conclusion: Experimental results on both simulated
data and several real-world scRNA-seq datasets suggest that hGNB is a powerful
tool for cell cluster discovery as well as cell lineage inference.

this retrospective study, the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation was studied
in subjects with low- and high-grade gliomas. A three-dimensional UNet model
was implemented to segment four different MR series (T1-weighted, post-contrast
T1-weighted, T2- weighted, and T2-weighted FLAIR) into four pixelwise labels
(Gd-enhancing tumor, peritumoral edema, necrotic and non-enhancing tumor, and
background). We developed attack strategies based on the Fast Gradient Sign
Method (FGSM), iterative FGSM (i-FGSM), and targeted iterative FGSM (ti-FGSM)
to produce effective attacks. Additionally, we explored the effectiveness of
distillation and adversarial training via data augmentation to counteract
adversarial attacks. Robustness was measured by comparing the Dice coefficient
for each attack method using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results: Attacks based
on FGSM, i-FGSM, and ti-FGSM were effective in significantly reducing the
quality of image segmentation with reductions in Dice coefficient by up to 65%.
For attack defenses, distillation performed significantly better than
adversarial training approaches. However, all defense approaches performed
worse compared to unperturbed test images. Conclusion: Segmentation networks
can be adversely affected by targeted attacks that introduce visually minor
(and potentially undetectable) modifications to existing images. With an
increasing interest in applying deep learning techniques to medical imaging
data, it is important to quantify the ramifications of adversarial inputs

spatially-resolved optical polarimetry technique, we show that a qualitatively
distinct nematic state arises in the triangular lattice antiferromagnet
Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. The crucial difference is that the nematic order on the
triangular lattice is a Z$_3$, or three-state Potts-nematic order parameter. As
a consequence, the anisotropy axes of response functions such as the
resistivity tensor can be continuously re-oriented by external perturbations.
This discovery provides insight into realizing devices that exploit analogies
with nematic liquid crystals.

assume that each individual in the network has the same peer effects on others.
Mechanically, they conclude the key player in the network to be the one with
the highest centrality. However, when some individuals are more influential
than others, centrality may fail to be a good measure. I develop a model that
allows for individual-specific endogenous effects and propose a two-stage LASSO
procedure to identify influential individuals in a network. Under an assumption
of sparsity: only a subset of individuals (which can increase with sample size
n) is influential, I show that my 2SLSS estimator for individual-specific
endogenous effects is consistent and achieves asymptotic normality. I also
develop robust inference including uniformly valid confidence intervals. These
results also carry through to scenarios where the influential individuals are
not sparse. I extend the analysis to allow for multiple types of connections
(multiple networks), and I show how to use the sparse group LASSO to detect
which of the multiple connection types is more influential. Simulation evidence
shows that my estimator has good finite sample performance. I further apply my
method to the data in Banerjee et al. (2013) and my proposed procedure is able

successfully used to study the single-particle nature of stable nuclei in
normal kinematics with the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA)
framework. Recently, these reactions have been applied to rare-isotope beams at
intermediate energies in inverse kinematics to study the quenching of
spectroscopic factors.
  Purpose: Our goal is to investigate the effects of various corrections and
uncertainties within the standard DWIA formalism on the $(p,pN)$ cross
sections. The consistency of the extracted reduction factors between DWIA and
other methods is also evaluated.
  Method: We analyze the $(p,2p)$ and $(p,pn)$ reactions data measured at the
R$^3$B/LAND setup at GSI for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes in the
incident energy range of 300--450 MeV/u. Cross sections and reduction factors
are calculated by using the DWIA method. The transverse momentum distribution
of the $^{12}$C($p$,$2p$)$^{11}$B reaction is also investigated.
  Results: We have found that including the nonlocality corrections and the M\o
ller factor affects the cross sections considerably. The proton-neutron
asymmetry dependence of reduction factors extracted by the DWIA calculation is
very weak and consistent with those given by other reaction methods and
\textit{ab initio} structure calculations.
  Conclusions: The results found in this work provide a detailed investigation
of the DWIA method for $(p,pN)$ reactions at intermediate energies. They also
suggest that some higher-order effects, which is essential for an accurate
cross-section description at large recoil momentum, is missing in the current
DWIA and other reaction models.

feasible to learn superpixel features using capsules and it is potentially
beneficial to perform image analysis in such a structured manner. This novel
deep learning architecture is examined in the context of an image

address this issue by conducting a qualitative study that examines how

only brightness recovery but also complex issues like color distortion and
noise, which usually hide in the dark. Simply adjusting the brightness of a
low-light image will inevitably amplify those artifacts. To address this
difficult problem, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end attention-guided
method based on multi-branch convolutional neural network. To this end, we
first construct a synthetic dataset with carefully designed low-light
simulation strategies. The dataset is much larger and more diverse than
existing ones. With the new dataset for training, our method learns two
attention maps to guide the brightness enhancement and denoising tasks
respectively. The first attention map distinguishes underexposed regions from
well lit regions, and the second attention map distinguishes noises from real
textures. With their guidance, the proposed multi-branch
decomposition-and-fusion enhancement network works in an input adaptive way.
Moreover, a reinforcement-net further enhances color and contrast of the output
image. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method
can produce high fidelity enhancement results for low-light images and
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin both
quantitatively and visually.

which an adversary poisons the training data of a target model to inject a
Trojan so that images carrying a specific trigger will always be classified
into a specific label. Prior research on this problem assumes the dominance of
the trigger in an image's representation, which causes any image with the
trigger to be recognized as a member in the target class. Such a trigger also
exhibits unique features in the representation space and can therefore be
easily separated from legitimate images. Our research, however, shows that
simple target contamination can cause the representation of an attack image to
be less distinguishable from that of legitimate ones, thereby evading existing
defenses against the backdoor infection.
  In our research, we show that such a contamination attack actually subtly
changes the representation distribution for the target class, which can be
captured by a statistic analysis. More specifically, we leverage an EM
algorithm to decompose an image into its identity part (e.g., person, traffic
sign) and variation part within a class (e.g., lighting, poses). Then we
analyze the distribution in each class, identifying those more likely to be
characterized by a mixture model resulted from adding attack samples to the
legitimate image pool. Our research shows that this new technique effectively
detects data contamination attacks, including the new one we propose, and is
also robust against the evasion attempts made by a knowledgeable adversary.

collimated jets are commonly observed, yet detection of a similar behavior in
wide-angle winds has been elusive. Here we show clear evidence that the

time when deployed, even as care practices, database systems, and population
demographics evolve. Due to de-identification requirements, however, current
experimental practices for public EHR benchmarks (such as the MIMIC-III
critical care dataset) are time agnostic, assigning care records to train or
test sets without regard for the actual dates of care. As a result, current
benchmarks cannot assess how well models trained on one year generalise to
another. In this work, we obtain a Limited Data Use Agreement to access year of
care for each record in MIMIC and show that all tested state-of-the-art models
decay in prediction quality when trained on historical data and tested on
future data, particularly in response to a system-wide record-keeping change in
2008 (0.29 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.10 drop in AUROC for
length-of-stay prediction with a random forest classifier). We further develop
a simple yet effective mitigation strategy: by aggregating raw features into
expert-defined clinical concepts, we see only a 0.06 drop in AUROC for
mortality prediction and a 0.03 drop in AUROC for length-of-stay prediction. We
demonstrate that this aggregation strategy outperforms other automatic feature
preprocessing techniques aimed at increasing robustness to data drift. We
release our aggregated representations and code to encourage more deployable

to issues in convergence and generalization. All existing modified AGMs
actually represent efforts in revising the A-LR. Theoretically, we provide a
new way to analyze the convergence of AGMs and prove that the convergence rate

such games in the context of resource allocation, where players move
simultaneously to decide portions of the resource they can consume under a

the worst case efficiency of both solution concepts in zero and the best case

  Localization in Untrimmed Videos",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Temporal action localization is a recently-emerging task, aiming to localize
video segments from untrimmed videos that contain specific actions. Despite the
remarkable recent progress, most two-stage action localization methods still
suffer from imprecise temporal boundaries of action proposals. This work
proposes a novel integrated temporal scale aggregation network (TSA-Net). Our
main insight is that ensembling convolution filters with different dilation
rates can effectively enlarge the receptive field with low computational cost,
which inspires us to devise multi-dilation temporal convolution (MDC) block.
Furthermore, to tackle video action instances with different durations, TSA-Net
consists of multiple branches of sub-networks. Each of them adopts stacked MDC
blocks with different dilation parameters, accomplishing a temporal receptive
field specially optimized for specific-duration actions. We follow the
formulation of boundary point detection, novelly detecting three kinds of
critical points (ie, starting / mid-point / ending) and pairing them for
proposal generation. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on two challenging
video benchmarks, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3. Our proposed TSA-Net
demonstrates clear and consistent better performances and re-calibrates new
state-of-the-art on both benchmarks. For example, our new record on THUMOS14 is
46.9% while the previous best is 42.8% under mAP@0.5.

calculate the upper bound on the average block error rate (BLER) of a code

However, it is a formidable task when iterative AC formulation is used.
Computational burden for solving the usual ACTNEP with these uncertainties is
such that, it is almost impossible to obtain a solution even for a medium-sized
system within a viable time frame. In this work, a two-stage solution
methodology is proposed to obtain quick, good-quality, sub-optimal solutions
with reasonable computational burden. Probabilistic formulation is used to
account for the different uncertainties. Probabilistic TNEP is solved by
2m+1-point estimate method along with a modified artificial bee colony (MABC)
algorithm, for Garver 6 bus and IEEE 24 bus systems. In both the systems, rated
wind generation is considered to be more than one-tenth of the total generation
capacity. When compared with the conventional single stage and existing
solution methods, the proposed methodology is able to obtain almost identical
solutions with extremely low computational burdens. Therefore, the proposed
method provides a tool for efficient solution of future probabilistic ACTNEP
problems with greater level of complexity.

bending rigidity, as the surface tension increases, protrusions are more easily
formed. This effect also gives rise to nontrivial dependence of membrane

of electrons is in general determined by different coupling constant
$\tilde\lambda$, which takes into account the finite width of conduction band,
and describes the smooth transition from the adiabatic regime to the region of
strong nonadiabaticity. In antiadiabatic limit, when $\Omega_0\gg E_F$, the new
small parameter of perturbation theory is
$\lambda\frac{E_F}{\Omega_0}\sim\lambda\frac{D}{\Omega_0}\ll 1$ ($D$ is
conduction band half -- width), and corrections to electronic spectrum (mass
renormalization) become irrelevant. However, the temperature of superconducting
transition $T_c$ in antiadiabatic limit is still determined by Eliashberg -
McMillan coupling constant $\lambda$. We consider in detail the model with
discrete set of (optical) phonon frequencies. A general expression for

mainly focuses on the learning of global structure by global shape
reconstruction, while ignoring the learning of local structures. To resolve
this issue, we propose Local-to-Global auto-encoder (L2G-AE) to simultaneously
learn the local and global structure of point clouds by local to global
reconstruction. Specifically, L2G-AE employs an encoder to encode the geometry
information of multiple scales in a local region at the same time. In addition,
we introduce a novel hierarchical self-attention mechanism to highlight the
important points, scales and regions at different levels in the information
aggregation of the encoder. Simultaneously, L2G-AE employs a recurrent neural
network (RNN) as decoder to reconstruct a sequence of scales in a local region,
based on which the global point cloud is incrementally reconstructed. Our
outperforming results in shape classification, retrieval and upsampling show
that L2G-AE can understand point clouds better than state-of-the-art methods.

context-aware IDS (RAIDS). When a computer-controlled car is driving through
continuous roads, road contexts and genuine frames transmitted on the car's
in-vehicle network should resemble a regular and intelligible pattern. RAIDS
hence employs a lightweight machine learning model to extract road contexts
from sensory information (e.g., camera images and distance sensor values) that
are used to generate control signals for maneuvering the car. With such ongoing
road context, RAIDS validates corresponding frames observed on the in-vehicle
network. Anomalous frames that substantially deviate from road context will be
discerned as intrusions. We have implemented a prototype of RAIDS with neural
networks, and conducted experiments on a Raspberry Pi with extensive datasets

using five test matrices on three types of computational nodes. The numerical
results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional block

optimization problem with a single sphere constraint, namely, finding a global

$\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{z}^{*}A\mathbf{z}+\frac{\beta}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lvert
z_{k}\rvert^{4}$ such that $\lVert\mathbf{z}\rVert_{2}=1$. This problem spans
multiple domains including quantum mechanics and chemistry sciences and we
investigate the geometric properties of this optimization problem. Fourth-order
optimality conditions are derived for characterizing local and global minima.
When the matrix in the quadratic term is diagonal, the problem has no spurious
local minima and global solutions can be represented explicitly and calculated
in $O(n\log{n})$ operations. When $A$ is a rank one matrix, the global minima
of the problem are unique under certain phase shift schemes. The strict-saddle
property, which can imply polynomial time convergence of second-order-type
algorithms, is established when the coefficient $\beta$ of the quartic term is
either at least $O(n^{3/2})$ or not larger than $O(1)$. Finally, the
Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz exponent of quartic-quadratic problem is estimated and it
is shown that the exponent is ${1}/{4}$ for a broad class of stationary points.

passive with a large enough index w.r.t. a special supply rate. This condition
fits for numerous existing models since it only constrains the input-output
property rather than the detailed dynamics. Furthermore, for three typical
examples of bus dynamics in power systems, we show that this condition can be
reached via proper control designs. Simulations on a 3-bus heterogeneous power
system verify our results in both lossless and lossy cases. The
conservativeness of our condition is also demonstrated, as well as the impact

nuclear chart. However, dealing fully with three-nucleon, possibly
four-nucleon, interactions makes the solving of the A-body Schr\""odinger
equation particularly cumbersome, if not impossible beyond a certain nuclear
mass. Consequently, ab initio calculations of mid-mass nuclei are typically
performed on the basis of the normal-ordered two-body (NO2B) approximation that
captures dominant effects of three-nucleon forces while effectively working
with two-nucleon operators. A powerful idea currently employed to extend ab
initio calculations to open-shell nuclei consists of expanding the exact
solution of the A-body Schr\""odinger equation while authorizing the approximate
solution to break symmetries of the Hamiltonian. In this context, operators are
normal ordered with respect to a symmetry-breaking reference state such that
proceeding to a naive truncation may lead to symmetry-breaking approximate
operators. The purpose of the present work is to design a normal-ordering
approximation of operators that is consistent with the symmetries of the
Hamiltonian while working in the context of symmetry broken (and potentially
restored) methods. Focusing on many-body formalisms in which U(1) global-gauge
symmetry associated with particle number conservation is broken (and
potentially restored), a particle-number-conserving normal-ordered k-body
(PNOkB) approximation of an arbitrary N-body operator is designed on the basis
of Bogoliubov reference states. A numerical test based on particle-number
projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations permits to check the
particle-number conserving/violating character of a given approximation to a
particle-number conserving operator. Using the presently proposed PNOkB

a mono-energetic 4 MeV proton injection over an extended region located at a

their intensity may drop below the detected pre-event intensity levels. We also
discuss how accelerated particle populations form on the reverse and forward

The self-consistent modeling over ultraviolet to radio wavelengths in
MAGPHYS+photo-z is unique compared to standard photometric redshift codes. The
broader wavelength consideration is particularly useful for breaking certain
degeneracies in color vs. redshift for dusty galaxies with limited
observer-frame ultraviolet and optical data (or upper limits). We demonstrate
the success of the code in estimating redshifts and physical properties for
over 4,000 infrared-detected galaxies at 0.4<z<6.0 in the COSMOS field with
robust spectroscopic redshifts. We achieve high photo-z precision
($\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z_{spec})}\lesssim0.04$), high accuracy (i.e., minimal
offset biases; median$(\Delta z/(1+z_{spec}))\lesssim0.02$), and low
catastrophic failure rates ($\eta\simeq4\%$) over all redshifts. Interestingly,
we find that a weak 2175A absorption feature in the attenuation curve models is
required to remove a subtle systematic photo-z offset
($z_{phot}-z_{spec}\simeq-0.03$) that occurs when this feature is not included.
As expected, the accuracy of derived physical properties in MAGPHYS+photo-z
decreases strongly as redshift uncertainty increases. The all-in-one treatment
of uncertainties afforded with this code is beneficial for accurately
interpreting physical properties of galaxies in large photometric datasets.
Finally, we emphasize that MAGPHYS+photo-z is not intended to replace existing

homotopy theory for Lie groups. The adjective `proper' alludes to the feature
that equivalences are tested on compact subgroups, and that the objects are
built from equivariant cells with compact isotropy groups; the adjective
`genuine' indicates that the theory comes with appropriate transfers and
Wirthm\""uller isomorphisms, and the resulting equivariant cohomology theories
support the analog of an $RO(G)$-grading.
  Our model for genuine proper $G$-equivariant stable homotopy theory is the
category of orthogonal $G$-spectra; the equivalences are those morphisms that
induce isomorphisms of equivariant stable homotopy groups for all compact
subgroups of $G$. This class of $\pi_*$-isomorphisms is part of a symmetric
monoidal stable model structure and the associated tensor triangulated homotopy
category is compactly generated. Every orthogonal $G$-spectrum represents an
equivariant cohomology theory on the category of $G$-spaces, depending only on
the `proper $G$-homotopy type', tested by fixed points under all compact
subgroups.
  An important special case are infinite discrete groups. For these, our
genuine equivariant theory is related to finiteness properties, in the sense of
geometric group theory; for example, the $G$-sphere spectrum is a compact
object in the equivariant homotopy category if the universal space for proper
$G$-actions has a finite $G$-CW-model. For discrete groups, the represented
equivariant cohomology theories on finite proper $G$-CW-complexes admit a more
explicit description in terms of parameterized equivariant homotopy theory,
suitably stabilized by $G$-vector bundles. Via this description, we can
identify the previously defined $G$-cohomology theories of equivariant stable

to achieve privacy protection. By the property of the post-processing holding
of differential privacy, the proposed approach satisfies the
$\epsilon-$differential privacy even when the original problem is unstable.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical privacy bound of the differential
privacy classification algorithm. Specifically, the privacy bound of our
algorithm is controlled by the algorithm iteration number, the privacy
parameter, the parameter of loss function, ADMM pre-selected parameter, and the
data size. Finally we apply our framework to logistic regression with $L_1$
regularizer and logistic regression with $L_{1/2}$ regularizer. Numerical

such that new missions can be easily implemented. The targets to be simulated
are stored in a flexible input format called SIMPUT. Based on this source
definition, a sample of photons is produced and then propagated through the
optics. In order to model the detection process, the software toolkit contains
modules for various detector types, ranging from proportional counter and
Si-based detectors, to more complex descriptions like transition edge sensor
(TES) devices. The implementation of characteristic detector effects and a
detailed modeling of the read-out process allow for representative simulations
and therefore enable the analysis of characteristic features, such as for
example pile-up, and their impact on observations. We present an overview of
the implementation of SIXTE from the input source, the imaging, and the

users always ask the most trustworthy user in proximity for D2D transmissions.
An analytical expression of the D2D success probability is first derived, which
represents the probability that the received signal to interference ratio is no

optimal caching strategy for the special unbiased case is derived in a closed

perturbative solutions for a small squeezing amplitude at parametric resonance

common model for a viscoelastic polymer solution. The configuration of these
multibead chains can be described by a distribution function that evolves
according to a Liouville or Fokker--Planck equation. For example, when we
consider a suspension of Hookean bead-spring pairs, this approach leads to the
well-known upper-convected Maxwell model. This is done by taking the second
moment of the Fokker--Planck equation that governs the distribution function,
which describes the stress of the bead-spring pairs on the fluid. The evolution
of these multibead-chain suspensions can be described using a double bracket
formulation with a Hamiltonian functional. The conservative part of the
dynamics is described by a Poisson bracket, and the dissipative part by an
additional symmetric bracket. We treat the configuration space of multibead
chains as a higher order tangent bundle. Lifting the fluid velocity field to
the bundle leads naturally to a semidirect product Lie--Poisson bracket for the
conservative dynamics. The elastic stress exerted by the chains then follows
directly from the Hamiltonian functional. For chains with three or more beads,
the possible bending of the chain introduces an angular momentum flux that is
absent for chains with two beads. This flux appear as an asymmetric elastic
stress whose antisymmetric part is the divergence of a rank-$3$ tensor, as in
the Cosserats' theory of couple stresses. We investigate the possibility of an
exact closure, passing from a distribution function description to a closed
internal state variable description of the fluid suspension, and obtain some
sufficient conditions for their existence. The resulting exactly closable
models are generalisations of the upper-convected Maxwell model to Hookean
bead-spring chains.

estimated through a direct correlation based on ultimate and proximate
analysis, whose parameters can easily be fitted with experimental data
available from sources such as the Phillys database for different biomass types
and implemented in process simulators such as Aspen Plus. For the biocrude
modeling, a multi-objective optimization model is proposed that refines the
selection of model compounds to match measured bulk thermochemical and physical
properties. Parameter fitting and multi-objective optimization were both
performed in Matlab and the codes are available in the supplementary material.
As a case study, the optimization model was applied to two different oils

applicable to other simulation tools. The results show that the methods for
estimating enthalpies of formation have a high impact on the energy balance and
consequently the models developed allow a more accurate estimation of the
energy requirement in the reactor. This is a key element in making accurate
heat integration and techno-economic analyses of thermochemical conversion

the Polyakov loop and in the Debye mass due to the Color-Magnetic Confinement.
Analytic expressions for quark pressure and magnetic susceptibility were
obtained. The expressions were represented as series and in integral form.
Magnetic susceptibility was found to increase rapidly with temperature and
slowly with density. The results at the zero density limit are in agreement
with lattice data.

  restoration",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a new regularization term for variational image
restoration which can be regarded as a space-variant anisotropic extension of
the classical isotropic Total Variation (TV) regularizer. The proposed
regularizer comes from the statistical assumption that the gradients of the
target image distribute locally according to space-variant bivariate Laplacian
distributions. The highly flexible variational structure of the corresponding
regularizer encodes several free parameters which hold the potential for
faithfully modelling the local geometry in the image and describing local
orientation preferences. For an automatic estimation of such parameters, we
design a robust maximum likelihood approach and report results on its
reliability on synthetic data and natural images. A minimization algorithm
based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is presented
for the efficient numerical solution of the proposed variational model. Some
experimental results are reported which demonstrate the high-quality of
restorations achievable by the proposed model, in particular with respect to
classical Total Variation regularization.

codecs, such as MPEG AVC, HEVC, VVC, Google VP9 and AOM AV1, as well as
existing container and transport formats, without imposing any changes at the
client side. Such compatibility is a crucial aspect when it comes to practical
deployment, especially due to the fact that the video content industry and
hardware manufacturers are expected to remain committed to these standards for
the foreseeable future. We propose to use deep neural networks as precoders for
current and future video codecs and adaptive video streaming systems. In our
current design, the core precoding component comprises a cascaded structure of
downscaling neural networks that operates during video encoding, prior to
transmission. This is coupled with a precoding mode selection algorithm for
each independently-decodable stream segment, which adjusts the downscaling
factor according to scene characteristics, the utilized encoder, and the
desired bitrate and encoding configuration. Our framework is compatible with
all current and future codec and transport standards, as our deep precoding
network structure is trained in conjunction with linear upscaling filters
(e.g., the bilinear filter), which are supported by all web video players.
Results with FHD and UHD content and widely-used AVC, HEVC and VP9 encoders
show that coupling such standards with the proposed deep video precoding allows
for 15% to 45% rate reduction under encoding configurations and bitrates
suitable for video-on-demand adaptive streaming systems. The use of precoding
can also lead to encoding complexity reduction, which is essential for
cost-effective cloud deployment of complex encoders like H.265/HEVC and VP9.

The algorithm facilitates large-scale processing by the efficient merging of

Analyzer (SWIA), Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA), Magnetometer (MAG), and
Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) instruments aboard MAVEN. The CIR event was
characterized by enhancements in solar wind density, velocity, and dynamic
pressure, and increased & fluctuating interplanetary magnetic field, and was
associated with enhanced fluxes of solar energetic particles. The Langmuir

observations such as electron density and electron temperature during this
period. The dayside ionosphere is significantly compressed only near the peak
of solar wind dynamic pressure enhancement (~14 nPa). In contrast, on the
nightside, the electron density remains depleted for a longer period of time.
The electron temperatures are also enhanced during the period of electron
depletion on the nightside. The STATIC (Suprathermal and Thermal Ion
Composition) measurements show enhanced fluxes of suprathermal heavy ions in
the Martian exosphere during CIR period, and evidences for enhanced tailward
flow of these pickup ions. The analysis suggests that the nightside ionosphere
is primarily controlled by the precipitating solar energetic particles and
pickup ions transported across the Martian terminator, and depletes
significantly when the heavy ion flux in the exosphere enhances.

probability and spin conductance decay exponentially with the system length. We
define two localization lengths based on the transmission probability and the

pole-matching in the scenario of parameter perturbation is discussed. It is
formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved by a branch and
bound algorithm. Then, an adaptive framework is proposed to build repository
ROMs at adaptively chosen parameter values, which well represent the parameter
domain of interest. To achieve this, we propose techniques including a
predictor-corrector strategy and an adaptive refinement strategy, which enable
us to use larger steps to explore the parameter domain of interest with good
accuracy. The framework also consists of regression as an optional
post-processing phase to further reduce the data storage. The advantages over
other parametric reduced-order modeling approaches are, e.g., compatibility
with any model order reduction method, constant size of the parametric
reduced-order model with respect to the number of parameters, and capability to
deal with complicated parameter dependency.

from much richer context, these models often fail in challenging scenarios,
e.g., severe occlusion, ambiguous lanes, and poor lighting conditions. In this
paper, we present a novel knowledge distillation approach, i.e., Self Attention
Distillation (SAD), which allows a model to learn from itself and gains
substantial improvement without any additional supervision or labels.
Specifically, we observe that attention maps extracted from a model trained to
a reasonable level would encode rich contextual information. The valuable
contextual information can be used as a form of 'free' supervision for further
representation learning through performing topdown and layer-wise attention
distillation within the network itself. SAD can be easily incorporated in any
feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNN) and does not increase the
inference time. We validate SAD on three popular lane detection benchmarks
(TuSimple, CULane and BDD100K) using lightweight models such as ENet, ResNet-18

surpasses existing algorithms. Notably, ENet-SAD has 20 x fewer parameters and

typically contains multiple hard scatterings in each event. Therefore the
partons from different jets have a significant chance to overlap in momentum
space. We find that 30% of the jets with $p_\perp > 50$ GeV, identified by the
standard anti-$k_\perp$ jet finding algorithm with jet cone size R=0.3, contain
`intruder' particles from overlapping generator-level jets. This fraction
increases with increasing beam energy and increasing R. The reconstructed
momentum of the jet differs from that of the modelled jet by the loss due to
jet partons which are outside of the jet cone and by the gain due to intruder
partons. The sum of both may be positive or negative. These intruder partons
particularly affect the radial jet momentum distribution because they
contribute mostly at large angles $\Delta r$ with respect to the jet centre.

  Combinatorial Designs",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that in any $r$-coloring of the edges of a complete $r$-uniform
hypergraph, there exists a spanning monochromatic component. Given a Steiner
triple system on $n$ vertices, what is the largest monochromatic component one
can guarantee in an arbitrary 3-coloring of the edges?
  Gy\'arf\'as proved that $(2n+3)/3$ is an absolute lower bound and that this
lower bound is best possible for infinitely many $n$. On the other hand, we
prove that for almost all Steiner triple systems the lower bound is actually
$(1-o(1))n$. We obtain this result as a consequence of a more general theorem
which shows that the lower bound depends on the size of a largest
\emph{3-partite hole} (that is, sets $X_1, X_2, X_3$ with $|X_1|=|X_2|=|X_3|$
such that no edge intersects all of $X_1, X_2, X_3$) in the Steiner triple
system (Gy\'arf\'as previously observed that the upper bound depends on this
parameter). Furthermore, we show that this lower bound is tight unless the
coloring has a particular structure.
  We also suggest a variety of other Ramsey problems in the setting of Steiner
triple systems.

a detailed understanding of the microscopic control parameters that induce

atomic substitutions are more involved. Nonetheless, replacing an elemental
constituent of a compound with an isovalent atom is---effects of disorder
aside---often viewed as merely affecting the lattice constant. Based on this
picture of chemical pressure, the unit-cell volume is identified as an
empirical proxy for the Kondo coupling. Here instead, we propose an ""orbital
scenario"" in which the coupling in complex systems can be tuned by
isoelectronic substitutions with little or no effect onto cohesive properties.
Starting with the Kondo insulator Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$, we consider---within
band-theory---isoelectronic substitutions of the pnictogen (Bi$\rightarrow$Sb)
and/or the precious metal (Pt$\rightarrow$Pd). We show for the isovolume series
Ce$_3$Bi$_4$(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$)$_3$ that the Kondo coupling is in fact
substantially modified by the different radial extent of the $5d$ (Pt) and $4d$
(Pd) orbitals, while spin-orbit coupling mediated changes are minute. Combining
experimental Kondo temperatures with simulated hybridization functions, we also
predict effective masses $m^*$, finding excellent agreement with many-body

fields for fourteen possible handgrip profiles based on experiments we
conducted. The loss from hand blockage on the antenna gains can be up to 20-25
dB, which implies that the possible hand grip profiles need to be taken into
account while designing beam codebooks. Specifically, we consider three
different codebook adaption schemes: a grip-aware scheme, where perfect
knowledge of the hand grip is available; a semi-aware scheme, where just the
application (voice call, messaging, etc.) and the orientation of the mobile
handset is known; and a grip-agnostic scheme, where the codebook ignores hand
blockage. Our results show that the ideal grip-aware scheme can provide more
than 50% gain in terms of the spherical coverage over the agnostic scheme,
depending on the grip and orientation. Encouragingly, the more practical
semi-aware scheme we propose provides performance approaching the fully
grip-aware scheme. Overall, we demonstrate that 5G mmWave handsets are
different from pre-5G handsets: the user grip needs to be explicitly factored

existence of octahedral webs of surfaces of Blaschke type generated by
asymptotic and characteristic lines which are diagonally related to lines of

Attentive Hint Training (AHT) approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work which successfully distill the knowledge from a deep pose

solving by exploiting the underlying symmetry over variables and clauses in a
formula. The key idea is to first identify sets of assignments which fall in
the same symmetry class, and then impose ordering constraints, called Symmetry
Breaking Predicates (SBPs), such that only one (or a small subset) of these
assignments is allowed to be a solution of the original SAT formula. While this
technique has been exploited extensively in the SAT literature, there is little
work on using symmetry breaking for SAT Modulo Theories (SMT). In SMT, logical
constraints in SAT theories are combined with another set of theory operations
defined over non-Boolean variables such as integers, reals, etc. SMT solvers
typically use a combination of SAT solving techniques augmented with calls to
the theory solver. In this work, we take up the advances in SAT symmetry
breaking and apply them to the domain of SMT. Our key technical contribution is
the formulation of symmetry breaking over the Boolean skeleton variables, which
are placeholders for actual theory operations in SMT solving. These SBPs are
then applied over the SAT solving part of the SMT solver. We implement our SBP
ideas on top of CVC4, which is a state-of-the-art SMT solver. Our approach can
result in significantly faster solutions on several benchmark problems compared
to the state-of-the-art. Our final solver is a hybrid of the original CVC4
solver, and an SBP based solver, and can solve up to 3.8% and 3.1% more
problems in the QF_NIA category of 2018 and 2019 SMT benchmarks, respectively,

a novel person Re-ID task called unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID, which
only needs the within-camera (intra-camera) label information but not
cross-camera (inter-camera) labels which are more expensive to obtain. In
real-world applications, the intra-camera label information can be easily
captured by tracking algorithms or few manual annotations. In this situation,
the main challenge becomes the distribution discrepancy across different camera
views, caused by the various body pose, occlusion, image resolution,
illumination conditions, and background noises in different cameras. To address
this situation, we propose a novel Adversarial Camera Alignment Network (ACAN)
for unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID. It consists of the camera-alignment
task and the supervised within-camera learning task. To achieve the camera
alignment, we develop a Multi-Camera Adversarial Learning (MCAL) to map images
of different cameras into a shared subspace. Particularly, we investigate two
different schemes, including the existing GRL (i.e., gradient reversal layer)
scheme and the proposed scheme called ""other camera equiprobability"" (OCE), to
conduct the multi-camera adversarial task. Based on this shared subspace, we
then leverage the within-camera labels to train the network. Extensive
experiments on five large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of ACAN
over multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised methods that take advantage of
labeled source domains and generated images by GAN-based models. In particular,

scientific disciplines. It also has a long history in physics, ranging from the
minimal action principle to finding ground states of disordered systems such as
spin glasses. Proximal algorithms form a class of methods that are broadly
applicable and are particularly well-suited to nonsmooth, constrained,
large-scale, and distributed optimization problems. There are essentially five
proximal algorithms currently known: Forward-backward splitting, Tseng
splitting, Douglas-Rachford, alternating direction method of multipliers, and
the more recent Davis-Yin. These methods sit on a higher level of abstraction
compared to gradient-based ones, with deep roots in nonlinear functional
analysis. We show that all of these methods are actually different
discretizations of a single differential equation, namely, the simple gradient
flow which dates back to Cauchy (1847). An important aspect behind many of the
success stories in machine learning relies on ""accelerating"" the convergence of
first-order methods. We show that similar discretization schemes applied to
Newton's equation with an additional dissipative force, which we refer to as
accelerated gradient flow, allow us to obtain accelerated variants of all these
proximal algorithms -- the majority of which are new although some recover
known cases in the literature. Furthermore, we extend these methods to
stochastic settings, allowing us to make connections with Langevin and
Fokker-Planck equations. Similar ideas apply to gradient descent, heavy ball,
and Nesterov's method which are simpler. Our results therefore provide a
unified framework from which several important optimization methods are nothing
but simulations of classical dissipative systems.

parabolic solar collector plant at high temperatures. Reduction of these losses
is traditionally achieved through the use of an optically selective coating on
the absorber pipe, which absorbs visible light well but emits poorly in the IR
region. Another possibility is the use of a hot mirror coating on the glass
cover of the receiver, which reflects thermal radiation back onto the absorber
pipe for reabsorption. In this paper, novel experimental results of a receiver
unit operating with a hot mirror coating is presented, and the results between
a developed model and a simulation are compared. It is seen that the
correspondence is encouragingly close (Chi-squared test p-values between 0.995
and 0.80), where the simulation underestimates the experimental performance.
Further, simulations to investigate the performance of various candidates for
hot mirror coating (ITO, Gold and Silver) in solar through the receiver are
presented, where it is seen that the hot mirror coating has access to higher
temperature regions (above 700K). Lastly, simulation of the effects of
variation of some optical parameters on overall plant efficiency, and

fluctuations in content at each interface. These generated surfaces were
subsequently utilized to map the interfacial roughness and its spatial
correlation length. The analysis revealed that the root mean squared roughness
of the buried interfaces in the investigated superlattices is sensitive to the
growth temperature with a value varying from about 0.2 nm (+/- 13%) to about
0.3 nm (+/- 11.5%) in the temperature range of 500-650 Celsius. The estimated
horizontal correlation lengths were found to be 8.1 nm (+/- 5.8%) at 650

growth temperature was found to improve the interfacial abruptness, with 30 %
smaller interfacial width is obtained at 500 Celsius. This behavior is
attributed to the thermally activated atomic exchange at the surface during the
heteroepitaxy. Finally, by testing different optical models with increasing

understanding how the brain processes information. In the Brain/MINDS project,
a connectivity study on marmoset brains uses two-photon microscopy fluorescence
images of axonal projections to collect the neuron connectivity from defined
brain regions at the mesoscopic scale. The processing of the images requires
the detection and segmentation of the axonal tracer signal. The objective is to
detect as much tracer signal as possible while not misclassifying other
background structures as the signal. This can be challenging because of imaging
noise, a cluttered image background, distortions or varying image contrast
cause problems.
  We are developing MarmoNet, a pipeline that processes and analyzes tracer
image data of the common marmoset brain. The pipeline incorporates
state-of-the-art machine learning techniques based on artificial convolutional
neural networks (CNN) and image registration techniques to extract and map all
relevant information in a robust manner. The pipeline processes new images in a
fully automated way.

single sender and multiple receivers with actions of a priori unknown types,
independently drawn from action-specific marginal distributions. As in the
standard Bayesian persuasion model, the sender has access to additional
information regarding the action types, which she can exploit when committing
to a (noisy) signaling scheme through which she sends a private signal to each
receiver. The novelty of our model is in considering the case where the
receivers interact in a sequential game with imperfect information, with
utilities depending on the game outcome and the realized action types. After
formalizing the notions of ex ante and ex interim persuasiveness (which differ
in the time at which the receivers commit to following the sender's signaling
scheme), we investigate the continuous optimization problem of computing a
signaling scheme which maximizes the sender's expected revenue. We show that
computing an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme is NP-hard when there
are three or more receivers. In contrast with previous hardness results for ex
interim persuasion, we show that, for games with two receivers, an optimal ex
ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time thanks to a
novel algorithm based on the ellipsoid method which we propose.

reflection-driven MHD turbulence in the solar wind. Our simulations describe
transverse, non-compressive MHD fluctuations within a narrow magnetic flux tube
that extends from the photosphere out to a heliocentric distance $r$ of 21
solar radii $(R_s)$. We launch outward-propagating ""$z^+$ fluctuations"" into
the simulation domain by imposing a randomly evolving photospheric velocity
field. As these fluctuations propagate away from the Sun, they undergo partial
reflection, producing inward-propagating ""$z^-$ fluctuations.""
Counter-propagating fluctuations subsequently interact, causing fluctuation
energy to cascade to small scales and dissipate. Our analytic model
incorporates alignment, allows for strongly or weakly turbulent nonlinear
interactions, and divides the $z^+$ fluctuations into two populations with
different characteristic radial correlation lengths. The inertial-range power
spectra in our simulations evolve toward a $k_\perp^{-3/2}$ scaling at $r>10
R_s$, where $k_\perp$ is the wave-vector component perpendicular to the
background magnetic field. In two of our simulations, the $z^+$ power spectra
are much flatter between the coronal base and $r \simeq 4 R_s$. We argue that
these spectral scalings are caused by: (1) high-pass filtering in the upper
chromosphere; (2) the anomalous coherence of inertial-range $z^-$ fluctuations
in a reference frame propagating outwards with the $z^+$ fluctuations; and (3)
the change in the sign of the radial derivative of the Alfv\'en speed at $r=r_m
\simeq 1.7 R_s$, which disrupts this anomalous coherence between $r=r_m$ and
$r\simeq 2r_m$. At $r>1.3 R_s$, the turbulent heating rate in our simulations
is comparable to the heating rate in a previously developed solar-wind model

good methods for approximate posterior inference, researchers can now easily
build, use, and revise complicated Bayesian models for large and rich data.
These capabilities, however, bring into focus the problem of model criticism.
Researchers need tools to diagnose the fitness of their models, to understand
where they fall short, and to guide their revision. In this paper we develop a
new method for Bayesian model criticism, the population predictive check
(Pop-PC). Pop-PCs are built on posterior predictive checks (PPCs), a seminal
method that checks a model by assessing the posterior predictive distribution
on the observed data. However, PPCs use the data twice -- both to calculate the
posterior predictive and to evaluate it -- which can lead to overconfident
assessments of the quality of a model. Pop-PCs, in contrast, compare the
posterior predictive distribution to a draw from the population distribution, a
heldout dataset. This method blends Bayesian modeling with frequenting
assessment. Unlike the PPC, we prove that the Pop-PC is properly calibrated.
Empirically, we study Pop-PC on classical regression and a hierarchical model
of text data.

Computer vision approaches are generally based on either 2D road image analysis
or 3D road surface modeling. However, these two categories are always used
independently. Furthermore, the pothole detection accuracy is still far from
satisfactory. Therefore, in this paper, we present a robust pothole detection
algorithm that is both accurate and computationally efficient. A dense
disparity map is first transformed to better distinguish between damaged and
undamaged road areas. To achieve greater disparity transformation efficiency,
golden section search and dynamic programming are utilized to estimate the
transformation parameters. Otsu's thresholding method is then used to extract
potential undamaged road areas from the transformed disparity map. The
disparities in the extracted areas are modeled by a quadratic surface using
least squares fitting. To improve disparity map modeling robustness, the
surface normal is also integrated into the surface modeling process.
Furthermore, random sample consensus is utilized to reduce the effects caused
by outliers. By comparing the difference between the actual and modeled
disparity maps, the potholes can be detected accurately. Finally, the point
clouds of the detected potholes are extracted from the reconstructed 3D road
surface. The experimental results show that the successful detection accuracy
of the proposed system is around 98.7% and the overall pixel-level accuracy is
approximately 99.6%.

interpolates among earlier proposals. It describes departures from conformal
symmetry, by the insertion of a single operator at leading order in the EFT. To
fit the lattice results, the global internal symmetry is explicitly broken,
producing a common mass for the pNGBs, as well as a further, additive
deformation of the scalar potential. We discuss sub-leading corrections arising
in the EFT from quantum loops. From lattice measurements of the scalar and pNGB
masses and of the pNGB decay constant, we extract model parameter values,
including those that characterise the scalar potential. The result includes the
possibility that the conformal deformation is clearly non-marginal. The
extrapolated values for the decay constants and the scalar mass would then be
not far below the current lattice-determined values.

the growth continuously from planetesimals to planets in the inner Solar
System. Previous studies show that the growth will be inside-out, but it is
still common practice to assume that the entire inner disk will eventually
reach a bi-modal distribution of embryos and planetesimals. For the
combinations of disk mass, initial planetesimal radius and gas disk lifetime
explored in this work the entire disk never reaches a simple bi-modal mass
distribution. We find that the inside-out growth is amplified by the combined
effects of collisional evolution of solid bodies and interactions with a
dissipating gas disk. This leads to oligarchic growth never being achieved in
different places of the disk at the same time, where in some cases the disk can
simultaneoulsy support chaotic growth and giant impacts inside 1 au and runaway
growth beyond 2 au. The planetesimal population is efficiently depleted in the
inner disk where embryo growth primarily advances in the presence of a
significant gas disk. Further out in the disk growth is slower relative to the
gas disk dissipation, resulting in more excited planetesimals at the same stage
of growth and less efficient accretion. This same effect drives mass loss due
to collisional grinding strongly altering the surface density of the accreted
planets relative to the initial mass distribution. This effect decreases the
Mars-to-Earth mass ratios compared to previous works with no collisional
grinding. Similar to some previous findings utilizing vastly different growth
scenarios these simulations produce a first generation of planetary embryos
that are stable for 10-20 Myr, or 5-10 e-folding times of the gas dissipation
timescale, before having an instability and entering the chaotic growth stage.

using numerical modelling. In such spherical droplets, we show the
three-dimensional structure of the topological defects, which due to closed
confinement emerge in the form of closed loops or surface-to-surface spanning
line segments. In the turbulent regime, the defects are shown to be strongly
spatially and time varying, with ongoing transformations between positive
winding, negative winding and twisted profiles, and with defect loops of zero
and non-zero topological charge. The timeline of the active turbulence is
characterised by four types of bulk topology-linked events --- breakup,
annihilation, coalescence and cross-over of the defects --- which we discuss
could be used for the analysis of the active turbulence in different
three-dimensional geometries. The turbulent regime is separated by a first
order structural transition from a low activity regime of a steady-state vortex
structure and an offset single point defect. We also demonstrate coupling of
surface and bulk topological defect dynamics by changing from strong
perpendicular to inplane surface alignment. More generally, this work is aimed
to provide insight into three-dimensional active turbulence, distinctly from

the effect of intra-atomic Coulomb correlation $U_{fc}$ between conduction and
local electrons, we find a first-order valence transition from Kondo region to
mixed valence upon ascending of local level above a critical $U_{fc}$, and this
valence transition usually occurs very close to or simultaneously with a
topological transition. Near the parameter region of zero-temperature valence
transition, rise of temperature can generate a thermal valence transition from
mixed valence to Kondo region, accompanied by a first-order topological
transition. Remarkably, above a critical $U_{fc}$ which is considerable smaller
than that generating paramagnetic valence transition, the original continuous
antiferromagnetic transition is shifted to first order one, at which a
discontinuous valence shift takes place. Upon increased $U_{fc}$, the
paramagnetic valence transition approaches then converges with the first-order

magnetic boundary. The continuous antiferromagnetic transition, first-order
antiferromagnetic transition, paramagnetic valence transition and topological

diabetes, obesity or cardiovascular diseases in one patient, is a frequent
phenomenon. To make care more efficient, it is of relevance to understand how
different diseases condition each other over the life time of a patient.
However, most of our current knowledge on such patient careers is either
confined to narrow time spans or specific (sets of) diseases. Here, we present
a population-wide analysis of long-term patient trajectories by clustering them
according to their disease history observed over 17 years. When patients
acquire new diseases, their cluster assignment might change. A health
trajectory can then be described by a temporal sequence of disease clusters.
From the transitions between clusters we construct an age-dependent multilayer
network of disease clusters. Random walks on this multilayer network provide a
more precise model for the time evolution of multimorbid health states when
compared to models that cluster patients based on single diseases. Our results
can be used to identify decisive events that potentially determine the future
disease trajectory of a patient. We find that for elderly patients the cluster
network consists of regions of low, medium and high in-hospital mortality.
Diagnoses of diabetes and hypertension are found to strongly increase the
likelihood for patients to subsequently move into the high-mortality region
later in life.

The underlying mechanisms for this pattern have been debated for some time. For
influenza, contenders include temperature, humidity, and vitamin D levels.
While such seasonal drivers may be sufficient to explain midwinter peaking it
is unclear if other respiratory viruses peaking in spring, summer, or fall have
individual environmental drivers. Here we present a dynamic model of
interacting diseases, in an effort to explain observed seasonal patterns
without requiring multiple seasonal drivers. Our model extends the classical
SIRS-model to include multiple diseases that interact via a short-lasting,
non-specific immunity component. This temporal protection is triggered by
exposure to any epidemic disease and lasts only a couple of weeks. We show that
the inhibiting disease-interaction allows recurrent epidemic behaviour without
any seasonal driving. In the presence of a single seasonal driver our model
parsimoniously predicts epidemic patterns such as sequentially occurring
epidemic diseases. We also present a two-disease simulation reproducing
multiple features observed in time series of parainfluenza strains PIV-3 and
biennial PIV-1 epidemic patterns. Complex epidemic patterns of seasonal
diseases may be explained by non-specific innate or cloub cell (T-cell)
mediated immune responses that result in interaction between unrelated

practical efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT), the most widely used
quantum chemical method, is a physical approach predicting energies and
electron densities of molecules. Recently, numerous papers on machine learning
(ML) of molecular properties have also been published. ML models greatly
outperform DFT in terms of computational costs, and may even reach comparable
accuracy, but they are missing physicality - a direct link to Quantum Physics -
which limits their applicability. Here, we propose an approach that combines
the strong sides of DFT and ML, namely, physicality and low computational cost.
By generalizing the famous Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, we derive general equations
for exact electron densities and energies that can naturally guide applications
of ML in Quantum Chemistry. Based on these equations, we build a deep neural
network that can compute electron densities and energies of a wide range of
organic molecules not only much faster, but also closer to exact physical
values than current versions of DFT. In particular, we reached a mean absolute
error in energies of molecules with up to eight non-hydrogen atoms as low as
0.9 kcal/mol relative to CCSD(T) values, noticeably lower than those of DFT
(down to ~3 kcal/mol on the same set of molecules) and ML (down to ~1.5
kcal/mol) methods. A simultaneous improvement in the accuracy of predictions of
electron densities and energies suggests that the proposed approach describes
the physics of molecules better than DFT functionals developed by ""human
learning"" earlier. Thus, physics-based ML offers exciting opportunities for
modeling, with high-theory-level quantum chemical accuracy, of much larger
molecular systems than currently possible.

predictor inputs in a MISO identification setup. In this paper an extension is
made to arrive at an identification setup for the situation that process noises
on the different node signals can be correlated with each other. In this
situation the local module may need to be embedded in a MIMO identification
setup for arriving at a consistent estimate with maximum likelihood properties.
This requires the proper treatment of confounding variables. The result is a
set of algorithms that, based on the given network topology and disturbance
correlation structure, selects an appropriate set of node signals as predictor
inputs and outputs in a MISO or MIMO identification setup. Three algorithms are
presented that differ in their approach of selecting measured node signals.

would lead to many applications inaccessible to conventional imaging methods.
However, it is challenging for high contrast and high resolution imaging, due
to its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the demand of high sampling rate in
detection. To circumvent these challenges, we here propose a ghost imaging
scheme that exploits Haar wavelets as illuminating patterns with a bi-frequency
light projecting system and frequency-selecting single-pixel detectors. This
method provides a theoretically 100% image contrast and high detection SNR,
which reduces the requirement of high dynamic range of detectors, enabling high
resolution ghost imaging. Moreover, it can highly reduce the sampling rate (far
below Nyquist limit) for a sparse object by adaptively abandoning unnecessary
patterns during the measurement. These characteristics are experimentally

every logic L is associated with a matrix semantics Mod*(L). This paper is a
contribution to the systematic study of the so-called ""truth sets"" of the
matrices in Mod*(L). In particular, we show that the fact that the truth sets

parameters is captured by an order-theoretic property of the Leibniz operator
restricted to deductive filters of L. This result was previously known for
equational definability without parameters. Similarly, it was known that the
truth sets of Mod*(L) are implicitly definable if and only if the Leibniz
operator is injective on deductive filters of L over every algebra. However, it
was an open problem whether the injectivity of the Leibniz operator transfers
from the theories of L to its deductive filters over arbitrary algebras. We
show that this is the case for logics expressed in a countable language, and
that it need not be true in general. Finally we consider an intermediate
condition on the truth sets in Mod*(L) that corresponds to the order-reflection

many deep learning models have been showing remarkable performances in a

Such high performance can be explained by efficient knowledge representation of

efficient representation, knowledge distillation from pretrained deep networks
suggest that we can use more information from the soft target probability to
train other neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new knowledge

distilled from the word embedding space right below the softmax layer. Due to
the time complexity, our method approximates the soft target probabilities. In

high-capacity main memory of computers. The characteristics of NVM devices,
however, tend to be fundamentally different from those of DRAM (i.e., the
memory device currently used for main memory), because of differences in
principles of memory cells. Typically, the write latency of an NVM device such
as PCM and ReRAM is much higher than its read latency. The asymmetry in
read/write latencies likely affects the performance of applications
significantly. For analyzing behavior of applications running on NVM-based main
memory, most researchers use software-based emulation tools due to the limited
number of commercial NVM products. However, these existing emulation tools are
too slow to emulate a large-scale, realistic workload or too simplistic to
investigate the details of application behavior on NVM with asymmetric
read/write latencies. This paper therefore proposes a new NVM emulation
mechanism that is not only light-weight but also aware of a read/write latency
gap in NVM-based main memory. We implemented the prototype of the proposed
mechanism for the Intel CPU processors of the Haswell architecture. We also
evaluated its accuracy and performed case studies for practical benchmarks. The
results showed that our prototype accurately emulated write-latencies of
NVM-based main memory: it emulated the NVM write latencies in a range from 200
ns to 1000 ns with negligible errors from 0.2% to 1.1%. We confirmed that the
use of our emulator enabled us to successfully estimate performance of
practical workloads for NVM-based main memory, while an existing light-weight
emulation model misestimated.

with just a few unexplained phenomena; which however led to a revolution and
the development of the 'modern physics'. Today the computing is in a similar
position: computing is a sound success story, with exponentially growing
utilization, but with a growing number of difficulties and unexpected issues as
moving towards extreme utilization conditions. In physics studying the nature
under extreme conditions has lead to the understanding of the relativistic and
quantal behavior. Quite similarly in computing some phenomena, acquired in
connection with extreme (computing) conditions, cannot be understood based on
of the 'classic computing paradigm'. The paper draws the attention that under
extreme conditions qualitatively different behaviors may be encountered in both
physics and computing, and pinpointing that certain, formerly unnoticed or
neglected aspects enable to explain new phenomena as well as to enhance
computing features. Moreover, an idea of modern computing paradigm
implementation is proposed.

Furthermore, we discuss Kaneko-Yamamoto multiple zeta values, and establish

  Oscillator and without Auxiliary Signals",,,,,"quant-ph cs.CR cs.LG eess.SP physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is realized with
coherent detection and is therefore very suitable for a cost-efficient
implementation. The major challenge in CV-QKD is mitigation of laser phase
noise at a signal to noise ratio of much less than 0 dB. So far, this has been
achieved with a remote local oscillator or with auxiliary signals. For the
first time, we experimentally demonstrate that CV-QKD can be performed with a
real local oscillator and without auxiliary signals which is achieved by
applying Machine Learning methods. It is shown that, with the most established
discrete modulation protocol, the experimental system works down to a quantum
channel signal to noise ratio of -19.1 dB. The performance of the experimental
system allows CV-QKD at a key rate of 9.2 Mbit/s over a fiber distance of 26
km. After remote local oscillator and auxiliary signal aided CV-QKD, this could
mark a starting point for a third generation of CV-QKD systems that are even
more attractive for a wide implementation because they are almost identical to
standard coherent systems.

pde2path, including localized patterns and homoclinic snaking, again in 1D, 2D

It is important that we ask not only ""what patterns exist in the data?"", but
also ""how do we want our system to impact people?"" In particular, because
minority and marginalized members of society are often statistically
underrepresented in data sets, models may have undesirable disparate impact on
such groups. As such, objectives of social equity and distributive justice
require that we develop tools for both identifying and interpreting harms

Specifically, spectroscopy in the mid-infrared wavelength range is of
particular interest, since most of the molecules have their strongest
rotational-vibrational transitions in this ""fingerprint"" region. Here we report
time-resolved mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy for the first time, covering
~300 nm bandwidth around 3.3 {\mu}m with 6 GHz spectral resolution and 20
{\mu}s temporal resolution. As a demonstration, we study a CH4/He gas mixture
in an electric discharge, while the discharge is modulated between dark and
glow regimes. We simultaneously monitor the production of C2H6 and the
vibrational excitation of CH4 molecules, observing the dynamics of both
processes. This approach to broadband, high-resolution, and time-resolved
mid-infrared spectroscopy provides a new tool for monitoring the kinetics of
fast chemical reactions, with potential applications in various fields such as
physical chemistry and plasma/combustion analysis.

has attracted special consideration as it presents both intriguing fundamental
physics problems and technological importance for potential multi-functional
devices and information handling. The dynamic strain can be generated by
acoustic waves including bulk, surface or guided waves. In this work, we
propose the theoretical and experimental investigation of the interaction of
pure shear horizontal (SH) wave with a uniaxial multilayered TbCo2/FeCo thin
film in a delay line configuration fabricated on Quartz ST-90X cut. We evaluate
theoretically the evolution of phase velocity as a function of magnetic field
and experimentally the variation of the transmission coefficient. A
piezomagnetic model was developed allowing us to calculate the elastic
stiffness constants of the multilayer as a function of the applied magnetic
field. The model was also implemented for acoustic waves dispersion curves
calculation. We show that the evolution of phase velocity is dominated by the
C66 elastic stiffness constant variation as expected for the case of shear
horizontal surface wave. The fabricated device let us exciting both fundamental
and third harmonic shear mode at 410 MHz and 1.2 GHz, respectively. For both
modes, the theoretical results corroborate very well the experimental ones. At
1.2 GHz the mode exhibits a maximum phase velocity shift close to 2.5% and an
attenuation reaching 500 dB/cm, for a sensitivity as high as 250 ppm/Oe. The
reported theoretical model and experimental results are of tremendous interest
for the development of advanced devices for magnetic field sensing applications
as well as investigating magnon-phonon interaction at a fundamental level.
