from killing $X$ at rate $q\in (0,\infty)$, followed by stopping it on

optimized for modern hardware, in-memory online transaction processing (OLTP)

Online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads, on the other hand, exhibit a
completely different computing pattern. OLAP workloads are read-only,
bandwidth-intensive and include various data access patterns including both
sequential and random data accesses. In addition, with the rise of
column-stores, they run on high performance engines that are tightly optimized
for the efficient use of modern hardware. Hence, the micro-architectural
behavior of modern OLAP systems remains unclear.
  This work presents the micro-architectural analysis of a breadth of OLAP
systems. We examine CPU cycles and memory bandwidth utilization. The results
show that, unlike the traditional, commercial OLTP systems, traditional,
commercial OLAP systems do not suffer from instruction cache misses.
Nevertheless, they suffer from their large instruction footprint resulting in
slow response times. High performance OLAP engines execute tight instruction
streams; however, they spend 25 to 82% of the CPU cycles on stalls regardless
of the workload being sequential- or random-access-heavy. In addition, high
performance OLAP engines underutilize the multi-core CPU or memory bandwidth
resources due to their disproportional compute and memory demands. Hence,
analytical processing engines should carefully assign their compute and memory
resources for efficient multi-core micro-architectural utilization.

this work, we explore several novel techniques for supercontinuum generation
covering near-UV to near-IR spectrum using AlN micro-photonic waveguides, which
is essential for frequency metrology applications: First, to create anomalous
dispersion, high order mode (TE10) was adopted, together with its carefully
designed high efficiency excitation strategies. Second, the spectrum was
broadened by soliton fission through third order dispersion and second harmonic
generation, by which directional energy transfer from near-IR to near-UV can be
obtained. Finally, high quality single crystalline AlN material was used to
provide broadband transparency from UV to IR. Under decently low pulse energy

  Much knowledge has already been acquired over the past decades, but the
infant stage of space weather forecasting demonstrates that we still have a
vast amount of learning to do. We can tackle this issue in two ways: 1) By
using multiple spacecraft measuring conditions in situ in the magnetosphere in
order to make sense of the fundamental small scale processes that enable
transport and coupling, or 2) By taking a global approach to observations of
the conditions that prevail throughout geospace in order to quantify the global
effects of external drivers.

a complete understanding of how the Sun gives rise to and controls the Earth's

short GRBs are originated in the merger of a black-hole (BH) with a neutron

expected flavor ratio and the opacity created by the baryon-loaded winds
ejected in each scenario. Moreover, We find that it is more feasible to detect
neutrinos from BH-NS than NS-NS systems. Finally, we also estimate the number
of neutrino events expected on ground-based detectors, finding that it is

reconstruction from discretized data. In this paper we study how accurately and
with what resolution the singularities of $f$ are reconstructed. The GRT
integrates over a fairly general family of surfaces $\mathcal S_y$ in $\mathbb

$\mathcal V\subset\mathbb R^3$. Assume that the data $g(y)=(\mathcal R f)(y)$
are known on a regular grid $y_j$ with step-sizes $O(\epsilon)$ along each

surface. Let $f_\epsilon$ denote the result of reconstruction from the descrete
data. We obtain explicitly the leading singular behavior of $f_\epsilon$ in an
$O(\epsilon)$-neighborhood of a generic point $x_0\in\mathcal S$, where $f$ has
a jump discontinuity. We also prove that under some generic conditions on
$\mathcal S$ (which include, e.g. a restriction on the order of tangency of
$\mathcal S_y$ and $\mathcal S$), the singularities of $f$ do not lead to
non-local artifacts. For both computations, a connection with the uniform
distribution theory turns out to be important. Finally, we present a numerical
experiment, which demonstrates a good match between the theoretically predicted
behavior and actual reconstruction.

phase boundary undergoes strong modification when strain is involved, yielding
complex phase transitions. Here, we report the emergence of the nanoscale M2

was previously targeted using quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray observations

probe the interplay between accretion inflow (X-ray) and jet outflow (radio).
Thus far, these combined observations have only covered one order of magnitude
in radio and X-ray luminosity range; this means that any potential radio -
X-ray luminosity correlation, $L_R \propto L_X^{\beta}$, is not well
constrained ($\beta \approx$ 0.4-0.9, based on various studies) or understood.
Here we present quasi-simultaneous Very Large Array and Swift-XRT observations
of Aql X-1's 2016 outburst, with which we probe one order of magnitude fainter
in radio and X-ray luminosity compared to previous studies ($6 \times 10^{34} <
L_X < 3 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, i.e., the intermediate to low-luminosity
regime between outburst peak and quiescence). The resulting radio
non-detections indicate that Aql X-1's radio emission decays more rapidly at
low X-ray luminosities than previously assumed - at least during the 2016
outburst. Assuming similar behaviour between outbursts, and combining all
available data, this can be modelled as a steep $\beta=1.17^{+0.30}_{-0.21}$
power-law index or as a sharp radio cut-off at $L_X \lesssim 5 \times 10^{35}$

take measurement with different levels of accuracy by expending different
levels of effort. They may also misreport their information in order to obtain
greater compensation, if possible. With both the measurements from the agents

use this to calculate semi-classical holographic correlators in fairly general
spacetimes, including flat space with timelike screens. We find that our
approach reduces to the standard Dirichlet-like approach, when restricted to
the boundary of AdS. But in more general settings, the analytic continuation of
the Dirichlet Green function does not lead to a Feynman propagator in the bulk.
Our prescription avoids this problem. Furthermore, in Lorentzian signature we
find an additional homogeneous mode. This is a natural proxy for the AdS
normalizable mode and allows us to do bulk reconstruction. We also find that
the extrapolate and differential dictionaries match. Perturbatively adding bulk
interactions to these discussions is straightforward. We conclude by elevating
some of these ideas into a general philosophy about mechanics and field theory.
We argue that localizing sources on suitable submanifolds can be an instructive
alternative formalism to treating these submanifolds as boundaries.

fitting of planetary systems observed through the radial velocity (RV)
technique. MMR can allow planets to remain stable in regions of phase space
where strong planet-planet interactions would otherwise destabilize the system.
These stable orbits can occupy small phase space volumes, allowing MMRs to
strongly constrain system parameters, but making searches for stable orbital
parameters challenging. Furthermore, libration of the resonant angle and
dynamical interaction between the planets introduces another, long period
variation into the observed RV signal, complicating analysis of the periods of
the planets in the system. We discuss this phenomenon using the example of HD
200964. By searching through parameter space and numerically integrating each
proposed set of planetary parameters to test for long term stability, we find
stable solutions in the 7:5 and 3:2 MMRs in addition to the originally
identified 4:3 MMR. The 7:5 configuration provides the best match to the data,
while the 3:2 configuration provides the most easily understood formation
scenario. In reanalysis of the originally published shorter-baseline data, we
find fits in both the 4:3 and 3:2 resonances, but not the 7:5. Because the time
baseline of the data is less than the resonant libration period, the current
best fit to the data may not reflect the actual resonant configuration. In the
absence of a full sample of the longer libration period, we find that it is of
paramount importance to incorporate long term stability when fitting for the

galaxies and characterize the evolution of the intergalactic medium. However,
many galaxies do not display Ly$\alpha$ emission in typical spectroscopic
observations, and intrinsic Ly$\alpha$-emitters represent a potentially biased
set of high-redshift galaxies. In this work, we analyze a set of 703 galaxies
at $2\lesssim z\lesssim3$ with both Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy and measurements of
other rest-frame ultraviolet and optical properties in order to develop an
empirical model for Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies and understand how the
probability of Ly$\alpha$ emission depends on other observables. We consider
several empirical proxies for the efficiency of Ly$\alpha$ photon production as
well as the subsequent escape of these photons through their local interstellar
medium. We find that the equivalent width of metal-line absorption and the O3
ratio of rest-frame optical nebular lines are advantageous empirical proxies
for Ly$\alpha$ escape and production, respectively. We develop a new quantity,
$X_\mathrm{LIS}^\mathrm{O3}$, that combines these two properties into a single
predictor of net Ly$\alpha$ emission, which we find describes $\sim$90% of the
observed variance in Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width when accounting for our
observational uncertainties. We also construct conditional probability
distributions demonstrating that galaxy selection based on measurements of
galaxy properties yield samples of galaxies with widely varying probabilities
of net Ly$\alpha$ emission. The application of the empirical models and
probability distributions described here may be used to infer the selection
biases of current galaxy surveys and evaluate the significance of high-redshift
Ly$\alpha$ (non-)detections in studies of reionization and the intergalactic
medium.

detected sources with multi-wavelength counterparts, and 30% of these are
unobscured quasars, with $L_X > 10^{44}\,$erg/s and $M_B < -23$. We define a
new population of quasars which are unobscured, have X-ray luminosities in

in the far-infrared, with a 250$\mu$m flux density of $S_{\rm 250}>30$mJy. We
refer to these Herschel-detected, unobscured quasars as ""Cold Quasars"". A mere
4% (21) of the X-ray- and optically-selected unobscured quasars in Stripe 82X

$\sim200-1400\,M_\odot$/yr. Cold Quasars are bluer in the mid-IR than the full
quasar population, and 72% of our Cold Quasars have WISE W3 $<$ 11.5 [Vega],
while only 19% of the full quasar sample meets this criteria. Crucially, Cold
Quasars have on average $\sim9\times$ as much star formation as the main
sequence of star forming galaxies at similar redshifts. Although dust-rich,
unobscured quasars have occasionally been noted in the literature before, we
argue that they should be considered as a separate class of quasars due to
their high star formation rates. This phase is likely short-lived, as the
central engine and immense star formation consume the gas reservoir. Cold
Quasars are type-1 blue quasars that reside in starburst galaxies.

cooling in many galaxy clusters. However, it is still unclear which physical
processes are acting to couple the energy from the bi-directional jets to the

AGN jets using MHD simulations. In the wake of the rising bubbles, a
significant amount of low-entropy gas is brought into contact with the hot
cluster gas. We assess the energy budget of the uplifted gas and find it
comparable to the total energy injected by the jets. Although our simulation
does not include explicit thermal conduction, we find that, for reasonable
assumptions about the conduction coefficient, the rate is fast enough that much
of the uplifted gas may be thermalized before it sinks back to the core. Thus,
we propose that the AGN can act like a heat pump to move low-entropy gas from
the cluster core to the heat reservoir and will be able to heat the inner
cluster more efficiently than would be possible by direct energy transfer from
jets alone. We show that the maximum efficiency of this mechanism, i.e. the
ratio between the conductive thermal energy and the work needed to lift the
gas, $\xi_{\mathrm{max}}$ can exceed 100 per cent. While $\xi$ <
$\xi_{\mathrm{max}}$ in realistic scenarios, AGN-induced thermal conduction has
the potential to significantly increase the efficiency with which AGN can heat
cool-core clusters and transform the bursty AGN activities into a smoother and
enduring heating process.

collective modes in the charge (c) and spin (s) channels with the Landau
parameter $F_l^{c(s)}$, starting from positive $F_l^{c(s)}$ and all the way to
the Pomeranchuk transition at $F_l^{c(s)} = -1$. In each case, we identify a
critical zero-sound mode, whose velocity vanishes at the Pomeranchuk
instability. For $F_l^{c(s)} < -1$, this mode is located in the upper frequency
half-plane, which signals an instability of the ground state. In a clean Fermi
liquid the critical mode may be either purely relaxational or almost
propagating, depending on the parity of $l$ and on whether the response
function is longitudinal or transverse. These differences lead to qualitatively
different types of time evolution of the order parameter following an initial
perturbation. A special situation occurs for the $l = 1$ order parameter that
coincides with the spin or charge current. In this case the residue of the
critical mode vanishes at the Pomeranchuk transition. However, the critical
mode can be identified at any distance from the transition, and is still
located in the upper frequency half-plane for $F_1^{c(s)} < -1$. The only
peculiarity of the charge/spin current order parameter is that its time
evolution occurs on longer scales than for other order parameters. We also
analyze collective modes away from the critical point, and find that the modes
evolve with $F_l^{c(s)}$ on a multi-sheet Riemann surface. For certain
intervals of $F_l^{c(s)}$, the modes either move to an unphysical Riemann sheet
or stay on the physical sheet but away from the real frequency axis. In that

encompassing economic, psychological and infrastructure aspects. In this paper,
we pose the following question: what is the optimal rate at which users should
access a social network? To answer this question, we propose an analytical
model to determine the value of an access (VoA) to the social network. In the
simple setting considered in this paper, VoA is defined as the chance of a user
accessing the network and obtaining new content. Clearly, VoA depends on the
rate at which sources generate content and on the filtering imposed by the
social network. Then, we pose an optimization problem wherein the utility of
users grows with respect to VoA but is penalized by costs incurred to access
the network. Using the proposed framework, we provide insights on the optimal
access rate. Our results are parameterized using Facebook data, indicating the
predictive power of the approach.

the prediction of two semi-analytic models (L-GALAXIES and SAGE) featuring

This enables us to study the correlation between the model passive fractions,
which is predicted to be suppressed by feedback from an AGN, and the observed
passive fractions in an observationally motivated parameter space. While the
passive fractions for observed central galaxies show a good correlation with
stellar mass and bulge mass, passive fractions in L-GALAXIES correlate with the
halo and black hole mass. For SAGE, the passive fraction correlate with the
bulge mass as well. Among the two models, SAGE has a smaller scatter in the
black hole - bulge mass (M_BH - M_Bulge) relation and a slope that agrees
better with the most recent observations at z \sim 0. Despite the more
realistic prescription of radio mode feedback in SAGE, there are still tensions
left with the observed passive fractions and the distribution of quenched
galaxies. These tensions may be due to the treatment of galaxies living in
non-resolved substructures and the resulting higher merger rates that could
bring cold gas which is available for star formation.

effective theory, containing the Standard Model, the $Z^\prime$, the fermionic

essential in enabling a strong first order phase transition. Dark CP violation
is diffused in front of the bubble walls and creates a chiral asymmetry for
$\chi$, which in turn creates a chemical potential for the Standard Model
leptons. Weak sphalerons are then in charge of transforming the net lepton
charge asymmetry into net baryon number. We explore the model phenomenology
related to the leptophilic $Z^\prime$, the dark matter candidate, the Higgs
boson and the additional scalar, as well as implications for electric dipole

to stellar radiation from nearby star forming regions. The necessary conditions
required to form these heavy seeds must be complemented with information on the
complex features of local environments and the fine balance between chemistry

vacuum energy and radiation, the associated emergent theory exhibits a
nonpropagating vector-tensor multiplet which has no analogue in standard
Einstein gravity. It is naturally inert, obeys a bounded equation of state and

found it hard to infer what topics SB could understand, with these

a complete, immersed surface of finite area and of constant extrinsic curvature
equal to $k$. In [32], we showed that such surfaces have finite genus and
finitely many cusp-like ends. Each of these cusps is asymptotic to an immersed
cylinder of exponentially decaying radius about a complete geodesic and
terminates at an ideal point which we call the extremity of the cusp. We show
that every cusp of any finite-type $k$-surface has a well-defined axis, which
we will call the Steiner geodesic of the cusp. One of its end-points is the
extremity, and we will call the other, which constitutes new geometric data,
the Steiner point of the cusp. We prove a new identity involving extremities
and Steiner points in terms of M\""obius invariant vector fields over the
Riemann sphere.
  We define two new functionals over the space of finite-type $k$-surfaces. The
first, which will be called the generalized volume, is defined by the integral
of a certain well-chosen form, and extends to the non-embedded case the concept
of volume of the set bounded by the surface. The second, which will be called
the renormalized energy, is related to the integral of the mean curvature of
the surface, and is well-defined up to a choice of Busemann function. Upon
describing natural parametrisations of the strata of the space of finite-type
$k$-surfaces by open complex manifolds, we prove a new Schl\""afli-type formula
relating the extremities and Steiner points to the first order variations of
the generalized volume and the renormalized energy. In particular, M\""obius
invariance of this formula yields the aforementioned identity. We conclude by
studying some applications of this identity and Schl\""afli-type formula.

liquid droplet in a supersaturated vapor phase. We consider this at different
extents of the driving force, which here is the extent of supersaturation, and
calculate a reaction coordinate (RC) for nucleation as the driving force is
varied. The RC is constructed as a linear combination of three order
parameters, where one accounts for the number of liquid-like atoms, and the
other two for local density fluctuations. The RC is calculated from all-atom
biased and unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the spectral gap
optimization approach ""SGOOP"" [P. Tiwary and B. J. Berne, Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. U. S. A. 113, 2839 (2016)]. Our key finding is that as the supersaturation
decreases, the RC ceases to simply be the number of liquid-like atoms, and
instead it becomes important to explicitly consider local density fluctuations
that correlate with shape and density variations in the nucleus. All three
order parameters are found to have similar barriers in their respective
potentials of mean force, however, as the supersaturation decreases the density
fluctuations decorrelate slower and thus carry longer memory. Thus at lower
supersaturations density fluctuations are non-Markovian and can not be simply
ignored from the RC by virtue of being noise. Finally, we use this optimized RC
to calculate nucleation rates in the infrequent metadynamics framework, and
show it leads to more accurate estimate of the nucleation rate with four orders
of magnitude acceleration relative to unbiased MD.

effects and energy-dependent transport properties. However, the full benefit of
many-body interactions in thermoelectric is yet to be investigated; identifying
the optimal interaction is a hard problem due to combinatorial explosion of the

allows for simple and flexible design of realizing the asymptotic Carnot

between a cyber insurance policyholder whose premium depends on her
self-reported security level and an insurer with the power to audit the
security level upon receiving an indemnity claim. Audits can reveal fraudulent
(or simply careless) policyholders not following reported security procedures,
in which case the insurer can refuse to indemnify the policyholder. However,
the insurer has to bear an audit cost even when the policyholders have followed
the prescribed security procedures. As audits can be expensive, a key problem
insurers face is to devise an auditing strategy to deter policyholders from
misrepresenting their security levels to gain a premium discount. This
decision-making problem was motivated by conducting interviews with
underwriters and reviewing regulatory filings in the U.S.; we discovered that
premiums are determined by security posture, yet this is often self-reported
and insurers are concerned by whether security procedures are practised as
reported by the policyholders.
  To address this problem, we model this interaction as a Bayesian game of
incomplete information and devise optimal auditing strategies for the insurers
considering the possibility that the policyholder may misrepresent her security
level. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first theoretical
consideration of post-incident claims management in cyber security. Our model
captures the trade-off between the incentive to exaggerate security posture
during the application process and the possibility of punishment for
non-compliance with reported security policies. Simulations demonstrate that
common sense techniques are not as efficient at providing effective cyber
insurance audit decisions as the ones computed using game theory.

models whose wave function is in the ground state with zero angular momentum.
The model generated by the two-commuting canonical momenta becomes the
quasi-classical model, in which the symmetric logarithmic derivative quantum
Cram\'er-Rao bound is achievable. The model generated by the two non-commuting
mechanical momenta, on the other hand, turns out to be a Gaussian model, where
the generalized right logarithmic derivative quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound is
achievable. We next consider mixed-state models by taking into account the
effects of thermal noise. The model with the canonical momenta now becomes
genuine quantum mechanical, although its generators commute with each other.
The derived uncertainty relationship is in general determined by two different
quantum Cram\'er-Rao bounds in a non-trivial manner. The model with the
mechanical momenta is identified with the well-known Gaussian shift model, and

achieved by leveraging three cardiovascular model fidelities, each with varying

built from combinations of these low-fidelity and high-fidelity models. We
demonstrate this framework on healthy and diseased models of aortic and
coronary anatomy, including uncertainties in material property and boundary

possible to accelerate the convergence of the estimators by utilizing a MLMF
paradigm. Therefore, we compare our approach to Monte Carlo and multilevel
Monte Carlo estimators based only on three-dimensional simulations. We
demonstrate significant reduction in total computational cost with the MLMF
estimators. We also examine the differing properties of the MLMF estimators in
healthy versus diseased models, as well as global versus local quantities of
interest. As expected, global quantities and healthy models show larger
reductions than local quantities and diseased model, as the latter rely more
heavily on the highest fidelity model evaluations. In all cases, our workflow
coupling Dakota's MLMF estimators with the SimVascular cardiovascular modeling

This allows our reasoning module to have diverse starting points when learning

the excitations at the $M$ point. These have been identified as having $xz$ and
$yz$ orbital character well below $T_{{\rm nem}}$, but remain split at
$T>T_{{\rm nem}}$, in apparent contradiction to the fact that in the tetragonal
phase the $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals are degenerate. Here we present two scenarios
which can describe the data. In both scenarios, hybridization terms present in
the tetragonal phase leads to an orbital transmutation, a change in the
dominant orbital character of some of the bands, between $T > T_{\rm nem}$ and
$T \ll T_{\rm nem}$. The first scenario relies on the spin-orbit coupling at
the $M$ point. We show that a finite spin-orbit coupling gives rise to orbital
transmutation, in which one of the modes, identified as $xz$ ($yz)$ at $T \ll
T_{{\rm nem}}$, becomes predominantly $xy$ at $T > T_{{\rm nem}}$ and hence
does not merge with the predominantly $yz$ ($xz$) mode. The second scenario,
complementary to the first, takes into consideration the fact that both ARPES
and STM are surface probes. In the bulk, a direct hybridization between the
$xz$ and $yz$ orbitals is not allowed at the $M$ point, however, it is
permitted on the surface. In the presence of a direct $xz/yz$ hybridization,
the orbital character of the $xz/yz$ modes changes from pure $xz$ and pure $yz$
at $T \ll T_{{\rm nem}}$ to $xz \pm yz$ at $T > T_{{\rm nem}}$, i.e., the two
modes again have mono-orbital character at low $T$, but do not merge at
$T_{{\rm nem}}$. We discuss how these scenarios can be distinguished in
polarized ARPES experiments.

superfluidity. Since each field $\Psi_j$ carries a phase $\theta_j$ and the
Lagrangian is invariant under rotations $\theta_j \to \theta_j + \alpha_j$ for
independent $\alpha_j$, one can investigate the corresponding wave function
overlap between a pair of ground states $\langle G|G'\rangle$ differing by
these phases. We operate in the infinite volume limit and use a particular
prescription to define these states by utilizing the position space kernel and
regulating the UV modes. We show that this overlap vanishes for most pairs of
rotations, including $\theta_j \to \theta_j + m_j \epsilon$, where $m_j$ is the
mass of each species, while it is unchanged under the transformation $\theta_j
\to \theta_j + q_j \epsilon$, where $q_j$ is the charge of each species. We
explain that this is consistent with the distinction between a superfluid, in
which there is a non-trivial conserved number, and the superconductor, in which
the electric field and conserved charge is screened, while it is compatible
with a non-zero order parameter in both cases. Moreover, we find that this bulk
ground state wave function overlap directly reflects the Goldstone boson
structure of the effective theory and provides a useful diagnostic of its

strain evolution measured by future space-based GW detectors and impact the
potential outcome of the mergers. Surveys now and in the near future will
generate an unprecedented population of detached WD binaries to constrain tidal
interactions. Motivated by this, I summarize the deviations between a binary
evolving under the influence of only GW emission and a binary that is also
experiencing some degree of tidal locking. I present analytic relations for the
first and second derivative of the orbital period and braking index.
Measurements of these quantities will allow the inference of tidal
interactions, even when the masses of the component WDs are not well
constrained. Finally, I discuss tidal heating and how it can provide
complimentary information.

  quantum mechanics -- Dirac case","18 pages",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A weakness which has previously seemed unavoidable in particle
interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as in the de Broglie-Bohm model) is
addressed here and a resolution proposed. The weakness in question is the lack
of action and reaction occurring between the model's field (or ""pilot wave"")
and the particle. Although the field acts on the particle, the particle does
not act back on the field. It is shown here that this rather artificial feature
is, in fact, not necessary and can be fully eliminated while remaining
consistent with the usual quantum predictions. Mathematically this amounts to
demonstrating that there exists a suitable Lagrangian density function which
generates equations coinciding with quantum mechanics yet incorporates the
desired action and reaction. As a by-product, an appealing explanation emerges
to another long-standing question, namely why the mathematical formalism of
quantum mechanics seems only to be describing fields when measurements
generally detect localised particles. A further bonus is that the hitherto
unrelated concept of a gauge transformation is found to arise naturally as an
essential part of the formalism. In particular, the phase S of the gauge
transformation is seen to be the action function describing the hidden motion
of the particle.

existing nodes and links can disappear and/or new nodes and links may be

interesting and non-trivial problem that has gained considerable interest over

to select and immunize a small proportion of individuals from the whole network

years suggesting different ways to immunize nodes in networks with overlapping

form, we are able to obtain a combined estimator by taking a weighted average
of local estimators. The resulting estimator is proved to be statistically as
efficient as the global estimator. Moreover, it requires only one round of

through three regimes: for very short times the particle diffuses freely until
it collides with an obstacle for the first time, while for very long times
diffusion the motion is Fickian with a diffusion coefficient $D$ that depends
on the concentration and type of obstacles present in the system. For
intermediate times, the mean-square displacement of the particle often
increases approximately as $~t^\alpha$, with $\alpha<1$, typical of what is
generally called anomalous diffusion. However, it is not clear how one can
identify or choose a time or displacement interval that would give a reliable
estimate of $\alpha$. In this paper, we use two exact numerical approaches to
obtain diffusion data for a simple Lattice Monte Carlo model in both time
limits. This allows us to propose an objective definition of the transient
regime and a unique value for $\alpha$. Furthermore, our methodology directly
gives us the length scale over which the transient regime switches to the
steady-state regime. We test our proposed approach using several types of
obstacle systems, and we introduce the novel concept of excess diffusion
lengths. Finally, we show that the values of the parameters describing the
anomalous transient regime depend on the Monte Carlo moves used to describe the
dynamics of the particle, and we propose a new algorithm that correctly models
the short time diffusion of a particle on a lattice.

distributions in the solar atmospheric layers. The spatial distributions are
crucial to reveal the physical origin of sunspot oscillations and to
investigate their propagation. In this study, six sunspots observed by Solar
Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly were used to obtain the
spatial distributions of three- and five-minute oscillations. The fast Fourier
transform method is applied to represent the power spectra of oscillation
modes. We find that, from the temperature minimum to the lower corona, the
powers of the five-minute oscillation exhibit a circle-shape distribution
around its umbra, and the shapes gradually expand with temperature increase.
However, the circle-shape is disappeared and the powers of the oscillations
appear to be very disordered in the higher corona. This indicates that the
five-minute oscillation can be suppressed in the high-temperature region. For
the three-minute oscillations, from the temperature minimum to the high corona,
their powers mostly distribute within an umbra, and part of them locate at the
coronal fan loop structures. Moreover, those relative higher powers are mostly
concentrated in the position of coronal loop footpoints.

profiles are energy dependent, the pulse fraction increases with the photon

Nevertheless, because the pulse shape generally has a double-peaked profile at

semantically richer and more consistent than visual attributes, which could
significantly alleviate the variance. We use the similarity preserving

learn the visual and language representation from both the images and captions
jointly, and thus enhance the performance of person re-ID. Extensive
experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets with or without image

recent years, lip reading methods have made great progress for English, at both

tone-based language and relies on pitches to distinguish lexical or grammatical

In this paper, we propose a Cascade Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Chinese
Mandarin (CSSMCM) lip reading, which explicitly models tones when predicting
sentence. Tones are modeled based on visual information and syntactic
structure, and are used to predict sentence along with visual information and
syntactic structure. In order to evaluate CSSMCM, a dataset called CMLR
(Chinese Mandarin Lip Reading) is collected and released, consisting of over
100,000 natural sentences from China Network Television website. When trained
on CMLR dataset, the proposed CSSMCM surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art lip reading frameworks, which confirms the effectiveness of
explicit modeling of tones for Chinese Mandarin lip reading.

making, meanwhile data privacy has been a common ethical/legal issue in
eliciting preferences from individuals. This work studies the problem of
aggregating individual's voting data under the local differential privacy
setting, where usefulness and soundness of the aggregated scores are of major
concern. One naive approach to the problem is adding Laplace random noises,
however, it makes aggregated scores extremely fragile to new types of strategic
behaviors tailored to the local privacy setting: data amplification attack and
view disguise attack. The data amplification attack means an attacker's
manipulation power is amplified by the privacy-preserving procedure when
contributing a fraud vote. The view disguise attack happens when an attacker
could disguise malicious data as valid private views to manipulate the voting
result.
  In this work, after theoretically quantifying the estimation error bound and
the manipulating risk bound of the Laplace mechanism, we propose two mechanisms
improving the usefulness and soundness simultaneously: the weighted sampling
mechanism and the additive mechanism. The former one interprets the score
vector as probabilistic data. Compared to the Laplace mechanism for Borda
voting rule with $d$ candidates, it reduces the mean squared error bound by
half and lowers the maximum magnitude risk bound from $+\infty$ to
$O(\frac{d^3}{n\epsilon})$. The latter one randomly outputs a subset of
candidates according to their total scores. Its mean squared error bound is
optimized from $O(\frac{d^5}{n\epsilon^2})$ to $O(\frac{d^4}{n\epsilon^2})$,
and its maximum magnitude risk bound is reduced to $O(\frac{d^2}{n\epsilon})$.
Experimental results validate that our proposed approaches averagely reduce
estimation error by $50\%$ and are more robust to adversarial attacks.

organized into three main parts:
  In the first part, we explore multiple formalisms to improve existing machine
comprehension systems. We propose a formulation for abductive reasoning in
natural language and show its effectiveness, especially in domains with limited
training data. Additionally, to help reasoning systems cope with irrelevant or
redundant information, we create a supervised approach to learn and detect the
essential terms in questions.
  In the second part, we propose two new challenge datasets. In particular, we
create two datasets of natural language questions where (i) the first one
requires reasoning over multiple sentences; (ii) the second one requires
temporal common sense reasoning. We hope that the two proposed datasets will
motivate the field to address more complex problems.
  In the final part, we present the first formal framework for multi-step
reasoning algorithms, in the presence of a few important properties of language
use, such as incompleteness, ambiguity, etc. We apply this framework to prove
fundamental limitations for reasoning algorithms. These theoretical results
provide extra intuition into the existing empirical evidence in the field.

However, there is insufficient discussion in the literature on the likelihood
of forming planet analogs simultaneously in the same system (analog system). To
address this issue, we performed 540 N-body simulations of protoplanetary disks
representative of typical models in the literature. We identified a total of
194 analog systems containing at least three analogs, but only 17 systems
simultaneously contained analogs of the four terrestrial planets. From an
analysis of our analog systems, we found that, compared to the real planets,
truncated disks based on typical outcomes of the Grand Tack model produced
analogs of Mercury and Mars that were too dynamically cold and located too
close to the Venus and Earth analogs. Additionally, all the Mercury analogs
were too massive, while most of the Mars analogs were more massive than Mars.
Furthermore, the timing of the Moon-forming impact was too early in these
systems, and the amount of additional mass accreted after the event was too
great. Therefore, such truncated disks cannot explain the formation of the
terrestrial planets. Our results suggest that forming the four terrestrial
planets requires disks with the following properties: 1) Mass concentrated in
narrow core regions between ~0.7-0.9 and ~1.0-1.2 au; 2) an inner region
component starting at ~0.3-0.4 au; 3) a less massive component beginning at

goal successfully within a stipulated time. As a consequence, Cloud Robotics
cannot be in a position to handle the traffic imposed by robots. On the
contrary, impending Fog Robotics can act as a solution by solving major
problems of Cloud Robotics. Therefore to check its feasibility, we discuss the
need and architectures of Fog Robotics in this paper. To evaluate the
architectures, we used a realistic scenario of Fog Robotics by comparing them
with Cloud Robotics. Next, latency is chosen as the primary factor for
validating the effectiveness of the system. Besides, we utilised real-time
latency using Pepper robot, Fog robot server and the Cloud server. Experimental
results show that Fog Robotics reduces latency significantly compared to Cloud
Robotics. Moreover, advantages, challenges and future scope of the Fog Robotics
system is further discussed.

measured. Among several such properties is the surface helium abundance of F
and G stars. We used the oscillatory signature introduced by the ionization of
helium in the observed oscillation frequencies to constrain the amount of
helium settling in F stars. For this purpose, we identified three promising F
stars for which the standard models of atomic diffusion predict large settling
(or complete depletion) of surface helium. Assuming turbulence at the base of
envelope convection zone slows down settling of the helium and heavy elements,
we found an envelope mixed mass of approximately $5 \times 10^{-4}$M$_\odot$
necessary to reproduce the observed amplitude of helium signature for all the
three stars. This is much larger than the mixed mass of the order of
$10^{-6}$M$_\odot$ found in the previous studies performed using the
measurements of the heavy element abundances. This demonstrates the potential
of using the helium signature together with measurements of the heavy element
abundances to identify the most important physical processes competing against
atomic diffusion, allowing eventually to correctly interpret the observed
surface abundances of hot stars, consistent use of atomic diffusion in
modelling both hot and cool stars, and shed some light on the long-standing
cosmological lithium problem.

curvature from a flat substrate are studied by using meshless membrane
simulations. The membrane is detached from an open edge leading to vesicle
formation. With strong adhesion, the competition between the bending and
adhesion energies determines the minimum value of the spontaneous curvature for
the detachment. In contrast, with weak adhesion, a detachment occurs at smaller
spontaneous curvatures due to the membrane thermal undulation. When parts of
the membrane are pinned on the substrate, the detachment becomes slower and a
remained membrane patch forms straight or concave membrane edges. The edge
undulation induces vesiculation of long strips and disk-shaped patches.
Therefore, membrane rolling is obtained only for membrane strips shorter than
the wavelength for deformation into unduloid. This suggests that the rolling
observed for Ca$^{2+}$-dependent membrane-binding proteins, annexins A3, A4,

model describing the behavior of magnetic Fe $3d$ electrons and further map it
onto the isotropic spin model. Our analysis suggests two possible scenaria for
Fe$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. The first one is based on the homogeneous charge
distribution of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions amongst tetrahedral ($t$) and octahedral
($o$) sites, which tends to low the crystallographic P6$_3$mc symmetry through
the formation of an orbitally ordered state. Nevertheless, the effect of the
orbital ordering on interatomic exchange interactions does not seem to be
strong, so that the magnetic properties can be described reasonably well by
averaged interactions obeying the P6$_3$mc symmetry. The second scenario, which
is supported by obtained parameters of on-site Coulomb repulsion and respects
the P6$_3$mc symmetry, implies the charge disproportionation involving somewhat
exotic $1+$ ionization state of the $t$-Fe sites (and $3+$ state of the $o$-Fe
sites). Somewhat surprisingly, these scenarios are practically
indistinguishable from the viewpoint of exchange interactions, which are
practically identical in these two cases. However, the spin-dependent
properties of the electric polarization are expected to be different due to the
strong difference in the polarity of the Fe$^{2+}$-Fe$^{2+}$ and
Fe$^{1+}$-Fe$^{3+}$ bonds. Our analysis uncovers the basic aspects of the ME
effect in Fe$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. Nevertheless, the quantitative description should
involve other ingredients, apparently related to the lattice and orbitals
degrees of freedom.

in order to reduce the dimensionality and extract underlying features using a
few latent common factors. Conventional methods for estimating the factor model
typically requires finite fourth moment of the data, which ignores the effect
of heavy-tailedness and thus may result in unrobust or even inconsistent
estimation of the factor space and common components. In this paper, we propose
to recover the factor space by performing principal component analysis to the
spatial Kendall's tau matrix instead of the sample covariance matrix. In a
second step, we estimate the factor scores by the ordinary least square (OLS)
regression. Theoretically, we show that under the elliptical distribution
framework the factor loadings and scores as well as the common components can
be estimated consistently without any moment constraint. The convergence rates
of the estimated factor loadings, scores and common components are provided.
The finite sample performance of the proposed procedure is assessed through
thorough simulations. An analysis of a financial data set of asset returns
shows the superiority of the proposed method over the classical PCA method.

87 yr. All three components of the system are probably of B8-9 spectral type,
and the parallax of the system was slightly shifted to the value of 2.92 mas.
On the other hand, the system V572 Per shows apsidal motion of its inner orbit,
the orbital period being of about 1.2 days, while the apsidal motion of about
48 yr. The components are of A and F spectral types, while the motion with the

been studied in the past. Recently, clustering with same-cluster queries has
become popular. An algorithm in this setting has access to an oracle with full
knowledge of an optimal clustering, and the algorithm can ask the oracle
queries of the form, ""Does the optimal clustering put vertices $ u $ and $ v $
in the same cluster?"" Due to its simplicity, this querying model can easily be
implemented in real crowd-sourcing platforms and has attracted a lot of recent
work. In this paper, we study the popular correlation clustering problem
(Bansal et al., 2002) under this framework. Given a complete graph $G=(V,E)$
with positive and negative edge labels, correlation clustering objective aims
to compute a graph clustering that minimizes the total number of disagreements,
that is the negative intra-cluster edges and positive inter-cluster edges. Let
$ C_{OPT} $ be the number of disagreements made by the optimal clustering. We
present algorithms for correlation clustering whose error and query bounds are
parameterized by $C_{OPT}$ rather than by the number of clusters. Indeed, a
good clustering must have small $C_{OPT}$. Specifically, we present an
efficient algorithm that recovers an exact optimal clustering using at most
$2C_{OPT} $ queries and an efficient algorithm that outputs a $2$-approximation
using at most $C_{OPT} $ queries. In addition, we show under a plausible
complexity assumption, there does not exist any polynomial time algorithm that
has an approximation ratio better than $1+\alpha$ for an absolute constant
$\alpha >0$ with $o(C_{OPT})$ queries. We extensively evaluate our methods on
several synthetic and real-world datasets using real crowd-sourced oracles.
Moreover, we compare our approach against several known correlation clustering
algorithms.

modalities. It has become an important research topic due to extensive
multimodal applications such as cross-modal retrieval. This paper attempts to
address the modality heterogeneity problem based on Gaussian process latent
variable models (GPLVMs) to represent multimodal data in a common space.
Previous multimodal GPLVM extensions generally adopt individual learning
schemes on latent representations and kernel hyperparameters, which ignore
their intrinsic relationship. To exploit strong complementarity among different
modalities and GPLVM components, we develop a novel learning scheme called
Harmonization, where latent model parameters are jointly learned from each
other. Beyond the correlation fitting or intra-modal structure preservation
paradigms widely used in existing studies, the harmonization is derived in a
model-driven manner to encourage the agreement between modality-specific GP
kernels and the similarity of latent representations. We present a range of
multimodal learning models by incorporating the harmonization mechanism into
several representative GPLVM-based approaches. Experimental results on four
benchmark datasets show that the proposed models outperform the strong
baselines for cross-modal retrieval tasks, and that the harmonized multimodal

dusty plasma is created in a DC glow discharge Ar plasma using kaolin
particles. A floating copper wire installed radially on the cathode, acts as a
charged object in the plasma environment. The flow on the dust fluid is
initiated by suddenly lowering the potential of the charged object from
grounded potential to close to floating potential. The size (height and width)
of the potential hill is then varied by drawing current from the wire through a
variable resistance. With a decrease in the height of the potential hill, the
amplitude, velocity and the number of exciting precursor solitons are found to
decrease whereas the widths of the solitons are seen to increase. It is found
that below a threshold value these solitary waves are not excited and the dust
fluid simply flows over the hill. To examine the effect due to the shape of the
potential profiles, the wire is replaced by a triangular object. Only trailing
wakes are seen to be excited when the dust fluid faces the linearly increasing
slope of the potential profile whereas both solitons and wakes get excited when
the object is placed with the sharp edge facing the flow. All the experimental

However, there is yet no unambiguous evidence of black holes in the

however, their masses are poorly constrained. The likely formation mechanisms
of IMBHs are also not understood. Here we make the case that multiband
gravitational wave astronomy --specifically, joint observations by space- and
ground-based gravitational wave detectors-- will be able to survey a broad
population of IMBHs at cosmological distances. By utilizing general
relativistic simulations of merging black holes and state-of-the-art
gravitational waveform models, we classify three distinct population of
binaries with IMBHs in the multiband era and discuss what can be observed about
each. Our studies show that multiband observations involving the upgraded LIGO
detector and the proposed space-mission LISA would detect the inspiral, merger
and ringdown of IMBH binaries out to redshift ~2. Assuming that next-generation
detectors, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer, are operational during
LISA's mission lifetime, we should have multiband detections of IMBH binaries
out to redshift ~5. To facilitate studies on multiband IMBH sources, here we
investigate the multiband detectability of IMBH binaries. We provide analytic
relations for the maximum redshift of multiband detectability, as a function of

new parameters which represent a more accurate projection of the variances than
the Eigenvectors recovered from PCA. We selected quasars from the XSHOOTER

were tested with PCA. We find that the new high-quality samples do indeed have
two dominant Eigenvectors as originally discovered. Subsequently we find that
the fitting of a non-linear decay curve to the main sequence allows a new plane
spanned by linearly independent axes to be defined, based on the distance along
the decay curve as the main axis and the distance of each quasar datapoint from
the curve as the secondary axis respectively. The results show that it is
possible to define a new plane based on the quasar main sequence which accounts
for the majority of the variance. The most likely candidate for the new main

simulated. A four-parameter Moore model is used for a generic thixotropic fluid
and discontinuous Galerkin method is employed to solve the structure-kinetics
equation coupled with the conservation equations of mass and momentum.
Depending on the normalized falling velocity $U^{*}$, which compares the time
scale of structure formation and destruction, flow solutions are divided into
three different regimes, which are attributed to an interplay of three
competing factors: Brownian structure recovery, shear-induced structure
breakdown, and the convection of microstructures. At small $U^{*}( \ll 1)$,
where the Brownian structure recovery is predominant, the thixotropic effect is
negligible and flow solutions are not too dissimilar to that of a Newtonian
fluid. As $U^{*}$ increases, a remarkable structural gradient is observed and
the structure profile around the settling sphere is determined by the balance
of all three competing factors. For large enough $U^{*}(\gg 1)$, where the
Brownian structure recovery becomes negligible, the balance between
shear-induced structure breakdown and the convection plays a decisive role in
determining flow profile. To quantify the interplay of three factors, the drag

The lack of consistent dynamics is a serious limitation for CG models, which
not only prevents quantitatively accurate predictions of dynamical observables

conversion without consideration of those difference can cause serious

our new method allows controlling the acceleration of the multi-rotor more
precisely by considering the dynamics of the multi-rotor during the kinematic

  Inspired by our computations, we separate the invariant $s^\sharp$ into two
new invariants for a knot $K$, $s^\sharp_+(K)$ and $s^\sharp_-(K)$, whose sum
is $s^\sharp(K)$. We show that their difference satisfies $0 \leq s^\sharp_+(K)

several analytic criteria that help guide the selection of gravitational
softening for hydrodynamical simulations, and present results from runs that
both adhere to and deviate from them. Unlike dark matter-only simulations,
hydrodynamical simulations exhibit a strong sensitivity to gravitational
softening, and care must be taken when selecting numerical parameters. Our
results--which focus mainly on star formation histories, galaxy stellar mass
functions and sizes--illuminate three main considerations. First, softening
imposes a minimum resolved escape speed, $v_\epsilon$, due to the binding
energy between gas particles. Runs that adopt such small softening lengths that
$v_\epsilon \gt 10\,{\rm km s^{-1}}$ (the sound speed in ionised $\sim
10^4\,{\rm K}$ gas) suffer from reduced effects of photo-heating. Second,
feedback from stars or active galactic nuclei may suffer from numerical
over-cooling if the gravitational softening length is chosen below a critical
value, $\epsilon_{\rm eFB}$. Third, we note that small softening lengths
exacerbate the segregation of stars and dark matter particles in halo centres,
often leading to the counter-intuitive result that galaxy sizes {\em increase}
as softening is reduced. The structure of dark matter haloes in hydrodynamical
runs respond to softening in a way that reflects the sensitivity of their
galaxy populations to numerical parameters.

technique, computation over multi-access channels (CoMAC), has emerged to
compute functions by exploiting the signal-superposition property of wireless
channels. However, the implementation of CoMAC in disorganized networks with
multiple relays (hops) is still an open problem. In this paper, we combine
CoMAC and orthogonal communication in the disorganized network to attain the
computation of functions at the fusion center. First, to make the disorganized
network more tractable, we reorganize the disorganized network into a
hierarchical network with multiple layers that consists of subgroups and
groups. In the hierarchical network, we propose multi-layer function
computation where CoMAC is applied to each subgroup and orthogonal
communication is adopted within each group. By computing and communicating
subgroup and group functions over layers, the desired functions are
reconstructed at the fusion center. The general computation rate is derived and
the performance is further improved through time allocation and power control.
The closed-form solutions to optimization are obtained, which suggest that
existing CoMAC and orthogonal communication schemes can be generalized.

accurate gradients in backward propagation, and reduce the quantization loss in

we consider a natural source of asymmetry, namely the magnetic field, and
calculate the density and pressure perturbations that are expected in the crust

allocation is addressed using the evolutionary game theoretic framework. The
issue of building temperature control is analyzed in which the controller is to
devise a scheme to distribute available scarce power to every room to regulate
their temperature as per the comfort of user in the best possible manner. The
paper correlates the global constraint of fixed resource amount with the
constant population size. The respective population game is evaluated by means
of a dynamical model of the evolutionary game theory to find the necessary
control action. The robustness of optimal solution with respect to minor
fluctuations in the temperature distribution is characterized using
evolutionary stable strategy ( ESS ). Along with the global constraint, the
problem formulation constitutes local constraint over an individual control
unit located in every room. The classical dynamical models of evolutionary game
theory such as replicator dynamics, logit dynamics, etc. fail to incorporate
respective constraints. With the escort evolutionary dynamical (ED) model it is
possible to address these local constraints through the concept of the
intersection of simplices. However, evaluation of these classical dynamics
along with ED is driven by expected payoff obtained by the overall population,
which renders a centralized implementation approach. To mitigate this central
dependency a distributed version of the ED model referred to as distributed
escort dynamics (DED) is proposed. The control action devised adopting DED
approach is shown to provide smooth trajectory tracking along with the low

long-lived horizons are difficult to achieve. Here, we theoretically
demonstrate a new type of optical BH analog based on light cone evolution
associated with topological phase transition of Dirac cones. The transition
from a type-II to type-I Dirac/Weyl cone creates an analogous curved spacetime
that crosses a type-III Dirac/Weyl cone, which affords a stationary
configuration of long-lived event horizon. Photons tunneling through the
horizon emit a spectrum of Hawking radiation. As an example, we design a
laboratory version in an inhomogeneous two-dimensional graphyne-like
topological photonic lattice with a Hawking temperature of 0.14 mK.
Understanding Hawking-like radiation in this unique topological BH is not only
of fundamental interest in its own right but may also provide new hints to

run-and-tumble motility patterns. In addition to this well-known chemotactic
behaviour, several soil and marine bacterial species perform chemokinesis: they
adjust their swimming speed according to the local concentration of
chemoeffector, with higher speed at higher concentration. A field of attractant
then induces a spatially varying swimming speed, which results in a drift
towards lower attractant concentrations -- contrary to the drift created by
chemotaxis. Here, to explore the biological benefits of chemokinesis and
investigate its impact on the chemotactic response, we extend a
Keller-Segel-type model to include chemokinesis. We apply the model to predict
the dynamics of bacterial populations capable of chemokinesis and chemotaxis in
chemoeffector fields inspired by microfluidic and agar plate migration assays.
We find that chemokinesis combined with chemotaxis not only may enhance the
population response with respect to pure chemotaxis, but also modifies it
qualitatively. We conclude presenting predictions for bacteria around dynamic
finite-size nutrient sources, simulating, e.g., a marine particle or a root. We
show that chemokinesis can reduce the measuring bias that is created by a

showed that the network lifetime can be increased using network reconfiguration
by up to 75% over a single, minimal-energy configuration. Further, our
solutions are feasible to implement in practical scenarios: only few
configurations are needed, thus requiring little storage for a standalone

these intermediates and moderate resolution limit the interpretation of the
data from current experiments. The S3 XFEL structures show extra density near
the OEC that may correspond to a water/hydroxide molecule. However, in the
latest structure, this additional oxygen is 2.08 {\AA} from the Oe2 of D1-E189,
which is closer than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two oxygens.
Here, we use Boltzmann statistics and Monte Carlo sampling to provide a model
for the S2-to-S3 state transition, allowing structural changes and the
insertion of an additional water/hydroxide. Based on our model, water/hydroxide
addition to the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is not thermodynamically
favorable in the S2 g = 2 state, but it is in the S2 g = 4.1 redox isomer.
Thus, formation of the S3 state starts by a transition from the S2 g = 2 to the
S2 g = 4.1 structure. Then, electrostatic interactions support protonation of
D1-H190 and deprotonation of the Ca2+-ligated water (W3) with proton loss to
the lumen. The W3 hydroxide moves toward Mn4, completing the coordination shell
of Mn4 and moving with its oxidation to Mn(IV) in the S3 state. In addition,
binding additional hydroxide to Mn1 leads to a conformational change of D1-E189
in the S2 g = 4.1 and S3 structures. In the S3 state in the population of
protonated D1-E189 increases.

$A_{n,1}:V\times\ldots\times V\Leftarrow V$ is an $n+1$-multilinear map

of (analytic) linear Lie rack structures on $(\mathfrak{h},[\;,\;])$ which can
be built from the canonical one and invariant multilinear symmetric maps on

deterministically introducing defects, only little is known about their impact
on the optical fingerprint of 2D materials. Here, based on a microscopic
approach we reveal direct signatures of localized bright excitonic states as
well as indirect phonon-assisted side bands of localized momentum-dark
excitons. The visibility of localized excitons strongly depends on temperature
and disorder potential width. This results in different regimes, where either
the bright or dark localized states are dominant in optical spectra. We trace
back this behavior to an interplay between disorder-induced exciton capture and

stellar age. The emission line ratios of the stacks are well fit with simple
uniform-density photoionization models with metallicities between solar and
twice solar. In the stacks, a number of emission lines are found to have
distinct broad components requiring a double Gaussian rather than a single
Gaussian fit, indicative of outflowing ionized gas. These are: [OIII]4959,
[OIII]5007, [OII]3727,3729 and Halpha$. Higher ionization lines such as

line flux and have widths of 600 km/s for the oxygen lines and 900 km/s for
Halpha. The fraction of the flux in the broad component and its width are
independent of [OIII] luminosity, stellar age, radio and mid-IR luminosity. The

flows. The objective of the study is to characterize, in detail, the local

promising results. In this paper, we propose a novel components loss (CL) for
the training of neural networks for mask-based speech enhancement. During the
training process, the proposed CL offers separate control over preservation of
the speech component quality, suppression of the residual noise component, and
preservation of a naturally sounding residual noise component. We illustrate
the potential of the proposed CL by evaluating a standard convolutional neural
network (CNN) for mask-based speech enhancement. The new CL obtains a better
and more balanced performance in almost all employed instrumental quality
metrics over the baseline losses, the latter comprising the conventional mean
squared error (MSE) loss and also auditory-related loss functions, such as the
perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) loss and the recently proposed
perceptual weighting filter loss. Particularly, applying the CL offers better
speech component quality, better overall enhanced speech perceptual quality, as
well as a more naturally sounding residual noise. On average, an at least 0.1
points higher PESQ score on the enhanced speech is obtained while also
obtaining a higher SNR improvement by more than 0.5 dB, for seen noise types.
This improvement is stronger for unseen noise types, where an about 0.2 points
higher PESQ score on the enhanced speech is obtained, while also the output SNR
is ahead by more than 0.5 dB. The new proposed CL is easy to implement and code

to evaluate a new treatment in several patient subgroups simultaneously. In
this paper, we extend the key ideas to disease areas outside of oncology,
developing a robust Bayesian methodology for randomised, placebo-controlled
basket trials with a continuous endpoint to enable borrowing of information
across subtrials with similar treatment effects. After adjusting for
covariates, information from a complementary subtrial can be represented into a
commensurate prior for the parameter that underpins the subtrial under
consideration. We propose using distributional discrepancy to characterise the
commensurability between subtrials for appropriate borrowing of information
through a spike-and-slab prior, which is placed on the prior precision factor.
When the basket trial has at least three subtrials, commensurate priors for
point-to-point borrowing are combined into a marginal predictive prior,
according to the weights transformed from the pairwise discrepancy measures. In
this way, only information from subtrial(s) with the most commensurate
treatment effect is leveraged. The marginal predictive prior is updated to a
robust posterior by the contemporary subtrial data to inform decision making.
Operating characteristics of the proposed methodology are evaluated through
simulations motivated by a real basket trial in chronic diseases. The proposed
methodology has advantages compared to other selected Bayesian analysis models,
for (i) identifying the most commensurate source of information, and (ii)
gauging the degree of borrowing from specific subtrials. Numerical results also
suggest that our methodology can improve the precision of estimates and,
potentially, the statistical power for hypothesis testing.

images is important for evaluation of infarction regions in clinical practice.
The pathological myocardium in LGE images presents distinctive brightness and
textures compared with the healthy tissues, making it much more challenging to
be segment. Instead, the balanced-Steady State Free Precession (bSSFP) cine
images show clearly boundaries and can be easily segmented. Given this fact, we
propose a novel shape-transfer GAN for LGE images, which can 1) learn to
generate realistic LGE images from bSSFP with the anatomical shape preserved,
and 2) learn to segment the myocardium of LGE images from these generated
images. It's worth to note that no segmentation label of the LGE images is used
during this procedure. We test our model on dataset from the Multi-sequence
Cardiac MR Segmentation Challenge. The results show that the proposed
Shape-Transfer GAN can achieve accurate myocardium masks of LGE images.

spatial-resolution data are required. Here, we use H-alpha imaging data sampled

investigate whether bi-directional flows can be detected within inverted-Y
shaped jets near the solar limb. These jets are apparent in the H-alpha line
wings, while no signature of either jet is observed in the H-alpha line core,
implying reconnection took place below the chromospheric canopy. Asymmetries in
the H-alpha line profiles along the legs of the jets indicate the presence of
bi-directional flows, consistent with cartoon models of reconnection in
chromospheric anemone jets. These asymmetries are present for over two minutes,
longer than the lifetimes of Rapid Blue Excursions, and beyond \pm 1 \AA\ into
the wings of the line indicating that flows within the inverted-Y shaped jets
are responsible for the imbalance in the profiles, rather than motions in the
foreground. Additionally, surges form following the occurrence of the
inverted-Y shaped jets. This surge formation is consistent with models which
suggest such events could be caused by the propagation of shock waves from
reconnection sites in the photosphere to the upper atmosphere. Overall, our
results provide evidence that magnetic reconnection in the photosphere can
cause bi-directional flows within inverted-Y shaped jets and could be the

accidents. Construction accidents are the result of the interaction between
unsafe work conditions and workers unsafe behaviors. Given this relation,
perceived risk is determined by an individual response to a potential work
hazard during the work. As such, risk perception is critical to understand
workers unsafe behaviors. Established methods of assessing workers perceived
risk have mainly relied on surveys and interviews. However, these post-hoc
methods, which are limited to monitoring dynamic changes in risk perception and
conducting surveys at a construction site, may prove cumbersome to workers.
Additionally, these methods frequently suffer from self-reported bias. To
overcome the limitations of previous subjective measures, this study aims to
develop a framework for the objective and continuous prediction of construction
workers perceived risk using physiological signals [e.g., electrodermal
activity (EDA)] acquired from workers wristband-type biosensors. To achieve
this objective, physiological signals were collected from eight construction
workers while they performed regular tasks in the field. Various filtering
methods were applied to exclude noises recorded in the signal and to extract
various features of the signals as workers experienced different risk levels.
Then, a supervised machine-learning model was trained to explore the
applicability of the collected physiological signals for the prediction of risk
perception. The results showed that features based on EDA data collected from
wristbands are feasible and useful to the process of continuously monitoring
workers perceived risk during ongoing work. This study contributes to an
in-depth understanding of construction workers perceived risk by developing a

wavelength of the Fourier modes is linearly increasing in the streamwise
direction with an amplitude which decays with the -3/2 power of distance from
the virtual origin. The streamwise evolution of the SADFM re-sembles reversed
wave shoaling known from surface waves. The energy- and cross-spectra obtained
from these SADFM exhibit a -5/3- and a -7/3-slope region, respectively, as
would be expected for regular Fourier modes in homogeneous and constant shear
flows. The approach introduced in this work can be extended to other flows
which admit to equilibrium similarity, such that a Fourier-based decomposition
along inhomogeneous flow directions can be performed.

understand and execute language instructions. A typical setup to achieve this
is with a scripted teacher which guides a virtual agent using language

more importantly, it is not interactive. Here, we introduce an autonomous agent
that uses discrete communication to interactively guide other agents to
navigate and act on a simulated environment. The developed communication
protocol is trainable, emergent and requires no additional supervision. The
emergent language speeds up learning of new agents, it generalizes across
incrementally more difficult tasks and, contrary to most other emergent
languages, it is highly interpretable. We demonstrate how the emitted messages
correlate with particular actions and observations, and how new agents become
less dependent on this guidance as training progresses. By exploiting the

identities with query images) in the top ranking list usually have the similar
color information with the query image in person re-identification (Re-ID).
Meanwhile, when we use the greyscale images generated from RGB images to
conduct the person Re-ID task, some hard query images can obtain better
performance compared with using RGB images. Therefore, RGB and greyscale images
seem to be complementary to each other for person Re-ID. In this paper, we aim
to utilize both RGB and greyscale images to improve the person Re-ID
performance. To this end, we propose a novel two-stream deep neural network
with RGB-grey information, which can effectively fuse RGB and greyscale feature
representations to enhance the generalization ability of Re-ID. Firstly, we
convert RGB images to greyscale images in each training batch. Based on these
RGB and greyscale images, we train the RGB and greyscale branches,
respectively. Secondly, to build up connections between RGB and greyscale
branches, we merge the RGB and greyscale branches into a new joint branch.
Finally, we concatenate the features of all three branches as the final feature
representation for Re-ID. Moreover, in the training process, we adopt the joint
learning scheme to simultaneously train each branch by the independent loss
function, which can enhance the generalization ability of each branch. Besides,
a global loss function is utilized to further fine-tune the final concatenated
feature. The extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets fully show
that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art person Re-ID
methods. Furthermore, using greyscale images can indeed improve the person
Re-ID performance.

a challenging task. In fast rotators, the oscillation spectrum of p-modes is a
superposition of sub-spectra which correspond to different types of modes,
among which island modes and chaotic modes are expected to be the most visible.
In the case of island modes, a semi-analytic formula describing the asymptotic
behavior of island modes has been obtained previously. We study the properties
of high frequency chaotic p-modes in a polytropic model. Unexpected peaks
appear in the frequency autocorrelations of the spectra. Our goal is to find a
physical interpretation for these peaks and also to provide an overview of the
mode properties. We use the 2D oscillation code TOP to produce the modes and
acoustic ray simulations to explore the wave properties in the asymptotic
regime. Using the tools developed in the field of quantum chaos (or wave
chaos), we derive an expression for the frequency autocorrelation involving the
travel time of acoustic rays. Chaotic mode spectra were previously thought to
be irregular, i. e. described only through their statistical properties. Our
analysis shows the existence, in chaotic mode spectra, of a pseudo large
separation. This means that chaotic modes are organized in series, such that
the modes in each series follow a nearly regular frequency spacing. The pseudo
large separation of chaotic modes is very close to the large separation of
island modes. Its value is related to the sound speed averaged over the
meridional plane of the star. In addition to the pseudo large separation, other
correlations appear in the numerically calculated spectra. We explain their
origin by the trapping of acoustic rays near the stable islands.

the variation of their amplitudes $h_+$ show a degeneracy on

pulse with a nanometre-thick target it is necessary to consider a target
preplasma formation due to the nanosecond long amplified-spontaneous-emission
pedestal and/or prepulse. The relatively long interaction time dictated that
hydrodynamic simulations should be employed to predict the target particles'
number density distributions prior the arrival of the main laser pulse. By
using the output of the hydrodynamic simulations as input into particle-in-cell
simulations, a detailed understanding of the complete laser-foil interaction is
achieved. Once the laser pulse interacts with the preplasma it deposits a
fraction of its energy on the target, before it is either reflected from the
critical density surface or transmitted through an underdense plasma channel. A
fraction of hot electrons is ejected from the target leaving the foil in a net
positive potential, which in turn results in proton and heavy ion ejection. In
this work protons reaching ~25 MeV are predicted for a laser of ~40 TW peak
power and ~600 MeV are expected from a ~4 PW laser system.

representation and semi-supervised learning tasks. However, existing GCNs
usually use a fixed neighborhood graph which is not guaranteed to be optimal
for semi-supervised learning tasks. In this paper, we first re-interpret graph
convolution operation in GCNs as a composition of feature propagation and
(non-linear) transformation. Based on this observation, we then propose a
unified adaptive neighborhood feature propagation model and derive a novel
Adaptive Neighborhood Graph Propagation Network (ANGPN) for data representation
and semi-supervised learning. The aim of ANGPN is to conduct both graph
construction and graph convolution simultaneously and cooperatively in a
unified formulation and thus can learn an optimal neighborhood graph that best
serves graph convolution for data representation and semi-supervised learning.
One main benefit of ANGPN is that the learned (convolutional) representation
can provide useful weakly supervised information for constructing a better
neighborhood graph which meanwhile facilitates data representation and
learning. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and benefit of the proposed ANGPN.

sentence B and vice versa. As a result, computing the similarity between a
query sentence and a set of candidate sentences, requires the propagation of
all query-candidate sentence-pairs throughout a stack of cross-attention

number of candidate sentences is large. In contrast, sentence embedding
techniques learn a sentence-to-vector mapping and compute the similarity
between the sentence vectors via simple elementary operations. In this paper,
we introduce Distilled Sentence Embedding (DSE) - a model that is based on
knowledge distillation from cross-attentive models, focusing on sentence-pair
tasks. The outline of DSE is as follows: Given a cross-attentive teacher model
(e.g. a fine-tuned BERT), we train a sentence embedding based student model to
reconstruct the sentence-pair scores obtained by the teacher model. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of DSE on five GLUE sentence-pair
tasks. DSE significantly outperforms several ELMO variants and other sentence
embedding methods, while accelerating computation of the query-candidate
sentence-pairs similarities by several orders of magnitude, with an average
relative degradation of 4.6% compared to BERT. Furthermore, we show that DSE
produces sentence embeddings that reach state-of-the-art performance on
universal sentence representation benchmarks. Our code is made publicly

perturbations and galactic tides. The former decrease with the distance, while
the latter increase. In the intermediate regime where they have the same order
of magnitude (the 'inert Oort cloud'), both are weak, resulting in very long
evolution timescales. To date, three observed objects can be considered to
belong to this category.
  Aims: We aim to provide a clear understanding of where this transition
occurs, and to characterise the long-term dynamics of small bodies in the
intermediate regime: relevant resonances, chaotic zones (if any), and
timescales at play.
  Results: There exists a tilted equilibrium plane (Laplace plane) about which
orbits precess. The dynamics is integrable in the low and high semi-major axis
regimes, but mostly chaotic in between. From 800 to 1100 au, the chaos covers
almost all the eccentricity range. The diffusion timescales are large, but not
to the point of being indiscernible in a 4.5 Gyrs duration: the perihelion
distance can actually vary from tens to hundreds of au. Orbital variations are
favoured in specific ranges of inclination corresponding to well-defined
resonances. Starting from uniform distributions, the orbital angles cluster
after 4.5 Gyrs for semi-major axes larger than 500 au, because of a very slow
differential precession.
  Conclusions: Even if it is characterised by very long timescales, the inert
Oort cloud is much less inert than it appears. Orbits can be considered inert
over 4.5 Gyrs only in small portions of the space of orbital elements, which
include (90377) Sedna and 2012VP113. Effects of the galactic tides are
discernible down to semi-major axes of about 500 au. We advocate including the
galactic tides in simulations of distant trans-Neptunian objects, especially
when studying the formation of detached bodies or the clustering of orbital
elements.

jointly optimizing for all targets simultaneously usually requires the

that decomposes the learnable parameters into a shared parametric model

propose an interleaved training procedure that optimizes the sub-task decoders
independently and thus does not require each sample to possess a ground truth

proposed method show comparable performance to independently trained models,
with less trainable parameters, more efficient inference, and an encoder
transferable to future target objectives. The results also show that using the

homogeneity and isotropy may now co-exist with violations of parity invariance.
The parity violating solutions have non-vanishing Weyl curvature even within
FRW models. The presence of parity violating torsion opens up the space of
possible such theories with relevant FRW modifications: in particular the
Pontryagin term can play an important role even in the absence of spinorial
matter. We present a number of parity violating solutions with and without
matter. The former are the non-self dual vacuum solutions long suspected to
exist. The latter lead to tracking and non-tracking solutions with a number of
observational problems, unless we invoke the Pontryagin term. An examination of
the Hamiltonian structure of the theory reveals that the parity even and the
parity violating solutions belong to two distinct branches of the theory, with
different gauge symmetries (constraints) and different numbers of degrees of
freedom. The parity even branch is nothing but standard relativity with a
cosmological constant which has become pure gauge under conformal invariance if
matter is absent, or a slave of matter (and so not an independent degree of
freedom) if non-conformally invariant matter is present. In contrast, the
parity violating branch contains a genuinely new degree of freedom.

Based on the first optimization-based attacking method, many following methods

generation-based methods have received much attention since they directly use
feed-forward networks to generate the adversarial samples, which avoid the
time-consuming iterative attacking procedure in optimization-based and
gradient-based methods. However, current generation-based methods are only able
to attack one specific target (category) within one model, thus making them not
applicable to real classification systems that often have hundreds/thousands of
categories. In this paper, we propose the first Multi-target Adversarial
Network (MAN), which can generate multi-target adversarial samples with a
single model. By incorporating the specified category information into the
intermediate features, it can attack any category of the target classification
model during runtime. Experiments show that the proposed MAN can produce
stronger attack results and also have better transferability than previous
state-of-the-art methods in both multi-target attack task and single-target
attack task. We further use the adversarial samples generated by our MAN to
improve the robustness of the classification model. It can also achieve better

automate. A unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning has
been presented in the literature. It proposed building a trustable machine
learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a
permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts on blockchain are
used to automate the machine learning process. In the proposed framework, a
core machine learning algorithm can have three implementations: server layer
implementation, streaming layer implementation, and smart contract
implementation. However, there are still open questions. First, the streaming
layer usually deploys on edge devices and therefore has limited memory and
computing power. How can we run machine learning on the streaming layer?
Second, most data that are stored on blockchain are financial transactions, for
which fraud detection is often needed. However, in some applications, training
data are hard to obtain. Can we build good machine learning models to do fraud
detection with limited training data? These questions motivated this paper;
which makes two contributions. First, it proposes training a machine learning
model on the server layer and saving the model with a special binary data
format. Then, the streaming layer can take this blob of binary data as input
and score incoming data online. The blob of binary data is very compact and can
be deployed on edge devices. Second, the paper presents a new method of
synthetic data generation that can enrich the training data set. Experiments
show that this synthetic data generation is very effective in applications such

Complementary to the established fluorescence microscopy, label-free

for bio-specimens and is free of variability introduced by contrast agents.
Here we report a simple and low-cost microscope add-on, termed Ptychographic
Modulation Engine (PME), for super-resolution quantitative phase imaging. In
this microscope add-on module, we attach a diffuser to a 3D-printed holder that
can be mechanically moved to different x-y positions. We then use two
vibrational motors to introduce random positional shifts to the diffuser. The
add-on module can be placed between the objective lens and the specimen in most
existing microscope platforms. Thanks to the diffuser modulation process, the
otherwise inaccessible high-resolution object information can now be encoded
into the captured images. In the ptychographic phase retrieval process, we
jointly recover the complex object wavefront, the complex diffuser profile, and
the unknown positional shifts of the diffuser. We demonstrate a 4-fold
resolution gain over the diffraction limit of the employed 2X objective lens.
We also test our approach for in-vivo cell imaging, where we are able to adjust

sample data set is generally required to obtain higher prediction accuracy, and
the prediction performance become worse when only a little data is available.
However, in practical, mostly we experience the problem of insufficient sample
data and how to accurately forecast the monthly electricity consumption with
limited sample data is a challenge task. The Holt-Winters exponential smoothing
method often used to forecast periodic series due to low demand for training
data and high accuracy for forecasting. In this paper, based on Holt-Winters
exponential smoothing method, we propose a hybrid forecasting model named
FOA-MHW. The main idea is that, we use fruit fly optimization algorithm to
select smoothing parameters for Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method.
Besides, electricity consumption data of a city in China is used to
comprehensively evaluate the forecasting performance of the proposed model. The
results indicate that our model can significantly improve the accuracy of
monthly electricity consumption forecasting even in the case that only a small

recognition, function approximation and image classification tasks. With the
growing size and complexity of these networks, hardware implementation becomes
challenging because scaling up the size of a single array (crossbar) of fully
connected neurons is no longer feasible due to strict energy budget. Modern
neromorphic hardware integrates small-sized crossbars with time-multiplexed
interconnects. Partitioning SNNs becomes essential in order to map them on
neuromorphic hardware with the major aim to reduce the global communication
latency and energy overhead. To achieve this goal, we propose our instantiation
of particle swarm optimization, which partitions SNNs into local synapses
(mapped on crossbars) and global synapses (mapped on time-multiplexed

performance by reducing inter-spike interval distortion and spike disorders.
Our framework is implemented in Python, interfacing CARLsim, a GPU-accelerated
application-level spiking neural network simulator with an extended version of
Noxim, for simulating time-multiplexed interconnects. Experiments are conducted
with realistic and synthetic SNN-based applications with different computation

number of neurons and synapses can shrink or expand in response to stimuli
throughout the span of life. We model this dynamic learning process as an
$L_0$-norm regularized binary optimization problem, in which each unit of a
neural network (e.g., weight, neuron or channel, etc.) is attached with a
stochastic binary gate, whose parameters determine the level of activity of a
unit in the network. At the beginning, only a small portion of binary gates
(therefore the corresponding neurons) are activated, while the remaining
neurons are in a hibernation mode. As the learning proceeds, some neurons might
be activated or deactivated if doing so can be justified by the cost-benefit
tradeoff measured by the $L_0$-norm regularized objective. As the training gets
mature, the probability of transition between activation and deactivation will
diminish until a final hardening stage. We demonstrate that all of these
learning dynamics can be modulated by a single parameter $k$ seamlessly. Our
neural plasticity network (NPN) can prune or expand a network depending on the
initial capacity of network provided by the user; it also unifies dropout (when
$k=0$), traditional training of DNNs (when $k=\infty$) and interpolates between
these two. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning framework
that unifies network sparsification and network expansion in an end-to-end

show that both network sparsification and network expansion can yield compact

vibrational modes by introducing time-dependent disorder. Our model describes
the experimentally observed high efficiency of light harvesting, despite the
absence of long-range quantum coherence. The one-exciton part of the quantum

all times. This lack of long-range coherence suggests a relatively minor role
for structure in determining the efficiency of bacterial light harvesting. To
investigate this we built hypothetical models with randomly arranged
chromophores, but still observed high efficiency when typical nearest-neighbour
distances are comparable with those found in nature. This helps to explain the
efficiency of energy transport in organisms whose chromophore networks differ
widely in structure, while also suggesting new design criteria for efficient
