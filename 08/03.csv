identities while managing authentication, authorization, and data sharing
within organizations and on the web. Traditional identity systems typically
suffer from single points of failure, lack of interoperability, and privacy
issues, such as enabling mass data collection and user tracking. Blockchain
technology has the potential to alleviate these concerns: it can support the
ability for users to control the custody of their own identifiers and
credentials, enabling novel data ownership and governance models with built-in
control and consent mechanisms. Hence, blockchain-based IDMSs, which could
benefit both users and businesses, are beginning to proliferate. This work
categorizes these systems into a taxonomy based on differences in blockchain
architectures, governance models, and other salient features. Context is
provided for the taxonomy through the description of related terms, emerging
standards, and use cases while highlighting relevant security and privacy
considerations.

inclusive cross sections are all of similar size and shape, the semi-inclusive
cross sections are subtantially different depending upon whether the spectral
functions contain some features associated with the nuclear shell model or are
based on the RFG and LDA models. Calculations of average values and standard
deviations of the initial neutrino energy using the semi-inclusive cross
section for the various models are presented and indicate that there may be
simple kinematical descriptions of the average neutrino energy which is common

$s,n,t\to\infty$ with $y=s/n^{1/2}={\mathrm O}(1)$ the random variable $t-s$
follows a Poisson distribution with mean $ky^2/2$. In the intermediate coverage
scaling limit, when both $s$ and $n-s$ are ${\mathrm O}(n)$, the mean value and
the variance of the covering time are growing as $n$ and the fluctuations are
Gaussian. When full coverage is approached the scaling functions diverge, which
is the signal of a new scaling behaviour. Indeed, when $u=n-s={\mathrm O}(1)$,
the mean value of the covering time grows as $n^k$ and the variance as
$n^{2k}$, thus $t$ is strongly fluctuating and no longer self-averaging. In
this scaling regime the fluctuations are governed, for each value of $k$, by a
different extreme value distribution, indexed by $u$. Explicit results are
obtained for monomers (generalized Gumbel distribution) and dimers.

these steady states, the statistical weight of a configuration is determined
from a matrix product, which can be written explicitly in terms of generalised
ladder operators. This lends a natural association to the enumeration of random
walks with certain properties.
  Specifically, there is a one-to-many mapping of steady-state configurations
to a larger state space of discrete paths, which themselves map to an even
larger state space of number permutations. It is often the case that the
configuration weights in the extended space are of a relatively simple form
(e.g., a Boltzmann-like distribution). Meanwhile, various physical properties
of the nonequilibrium steady state - such as the entropy - can be interpreted
in terms of how this larger state space has been partitioned.
  These mappings sometimes allow physical results to be derived very simply,
and conversely the physical approach allows some new combinatorial problems to
be solved. This work brings together results and observations scattered in the
combinatorics and statistical physics literature, and also presents new
results. The review is pitched at statistical physicists who, though not

captures the last observed activity features. The predicted labels and the
observed scene context are then mapped to meaningful captions using a

use this statistical equivalence to regularize the form of permissible Bayesian
quadrature integration priors such that they are guaranteed to be objectively
comparable with MC. This leads to the proof that simple quadrature methods have
expected variances that are less than or equal to their corresponding
theoretical MC integration variances. Separately, using Bayesian probability

give up using AQMs or use conservative offline configurations for them.
However, these choices will significantly impact the performance of the
emerging interactive and highly delay sensitive applications such as virtual

  Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the problems of existing AQM schemes
and show that they are not suitable options to support ultra-low latency

networks. Moreover, we believe that achieving good performance does not
necessarily come from complex drop rate calculation algorithms or complicated

spontaneous collapse and triggered collapse. Triggered star formation
mechanisms further diverge into cloud-cloud collision (CCC), ""collect and
collapse"" (C\&C) and shock induced collapse of pre-existing, gravitationally
stable cores, or 'radiation driven implosion' (RDI). To evaluate the
contributions of these mechanisms and establish whether these processes can
occur together within the same star forming region we performed mapping
observations of radio frequency ammonia, and water maser emission lines in the
S235 massive star forming region. Via spectral analyses of main, hyperfine and
multi-transitional ammonia lines we explored the distribution of temperature
and column density in the dense gas in the S235 and S235AB star forming region.
The most remarkable result of the mapping observations is the discovery of high
density gas in inter-core bridges which physically link dense molecular cores
that house young proto-stellar clusters. The presence of dense gas implies the
potential for future star formation within the system of cores and gas bridges.
Cluster formation implies collapse and the continuous physical links, also seen
in re-imaged archival CS and $^{13}$CO maps, suggests a common origin to the
molecular cores housing these clusters, i.e the structure condensed from a
single, larger parent cloud, brought about by the influence of a local
expanding H${\rm II}$ region. An ammonia absorption feature co-locating with
the center of the extended H${\rm II}$ region may be attributed to an older gas
component left over from the period prior to formation of the H${\rm II}$
region. Our observations also detail known and new sites of water maser
emission, highlighting regions of active ongoing star formation.

definition is highlighted by a demonstration of its r\^ole in connecting weak
solutions to McKean-Vlasov SDEs with common noise and solutions to
corresponding stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). By keeping
track of the dependence structure between all components in a sequence of
approximating processes, a compactness argument is employed to prove the
existence of a weak solution assuming boundedness and joint continuity of the
coefficients (allowing for degenerate diffusions). Weak uniqueness is
established when the private (idiosyncratic) noise's diffusion coefficient is
non-degenerate and the drift is regular in the total variation distance. This
seems sharp when one considers using finite-dimensional noise to regularise an
infinite dimensional problem. The proof relies on a suitably tailored cost
function in the Monge-Kantorovich problem and representation of weak solutions
via Girsanov transformations.

transparent, or cloaked, object). Even more, the radiationless anapole field
distribution cannot be sustained without the actual presence of external
incident fields. Conversely, we prove that the Lorentz reciprocity theorem
prevents the external excitation of radiationless optical eigenmodes, as in the

By measuring a small number $m \ll n_r n_c$ of elements of $X$, is it possible
to recover $X$ exactly with noise-free measurements, or to construct a good
approximation of $X$ with noisy measurements? Existing solutions to these
problems involve sampling the elements uniformly and at random, and can
guarantee exact recovery of the unknown matrix only with high probability. In
this paper, we present a \textit{deterministic} sampling method for matrix
completion. We achieve this by choosing the sampling set as the edge set of an
asymmetric Ramanujan bigraph, and constrained nuclear norm minimization is the
recovery method. Specifically, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
unknown matrix is completed exactly with noise-free measurements, and is
approximately completed with noisy measurements, which we call ""stable""
completion.
  The conditions derived here are only sufficient and more restrictive than
random sampling. To study how close they are to being necessary, we conducted
numerical simulations on randomly generated low rank matrices, using the LPS
families of Ramanujan graphs. These simulations demonstrate two facts: (i) In
order to achieve exact completion, it appears sufficient to choose the degree
$d$ of the Ramanujan graph to be $\geq 3r$. (ii) There is a ""phase transition,""
whereby the likelihood of success suddenly drops from 100\% to 0\% if the rank
is increased by just one or two beyond a critical value. The phase transition
phenomenon is well-known and well-studied in vector recovery using
$\ell_1$-norm minimization. However, it is less studied in matrix completion
and nuclear norm minimization, and not much understood.

luminosity, we were able to trigger four different observations sampling the
evolution of the source in the hard state. We show that even for the lowest
luminosity observations the NuSTAR spectra show clear signatures of X-ray
reprocessing (reflection) in an accretion disk. Detailed analysis of the
highest signal-to-noise spectra with our family of relativistic reflection
models RELXILL indicates the presence of both broad and narrow reflection
components. We find that a dual-lamppost model provides a superior fit when
compared to the standard single lamppost plus distant neutral reflection. In
the dual lamppost model two sources at different heights are placed on the
rotational axis of the black hole, suggesting that the narrow component of the
Fe K emission is likely to originate in regions far away in the disk, but still
significantly affected by its rotational motions. Regardless of the geometry
assumed, we find that the inner edge of the accretion disk reaches a few
gravitational radii in all our fits, consistent with previous determinations at
similar luminosity levels. This confirms a very low degree of disk truncation
for this source at luminosities above ~1% Eddington. Our estimates of Rin
reinforces the suggested behavior for an inner disk that approaches the
inner-most regions as the luminosity increases in the hard state.

driving behavior, and CAVs expect other non-autonomous entities on the road
will follow the traffic rules or common driving behavior. However, the presence
of aggressive human drivers in the surrounding environment, who may not follow
traffic rules and behave abruptly, can lead to serious safety consequences. In
this paper, we have addressed the CAV and non-CAV interaction by evaluating a
situation-awareness module for left-turning CAV operations in an urban area.
Existing literature does not consider the intent of the following vehicle for a
CAVs left-turning movement, and existing CAV controllers do not assess the

high in-plane resolution with high sampling efficiency and low T2* blurring.
However, due to the geometric distortion, shot-to-shot phase variations and
potential subject motion, msEPI continues to be a challenge in MRI. In this
work, we introduce acquisition and reconstruction strategies for robust,
high-quality msEPI without phase navigators. We propose Blip Up-Down
Acquisition (BUDA) using interleaved blip-up and -down phase encoding, and
incorporate B0 forward-modeling into Hankel structured low-rank model to enable
distortion- and navigator-free msEPI. We improve the acquisition efficiency and
reconstruction quality by incorporating simultaneous multi-slice acquisition
and virtual-coil reconstruction into the BUDA technique. We further combine
BUDA with the novel RF-encoded gSlider acquisition, dubbed BUDA-gSlider, to
achieve rapid high isotropic-resolution MRI. Deploying BUDA-gSlider with
model-based reconstruction allows for distortion-free whole-brain 1mm isotropic
T2 mapping in about 1 minute. It also provides whole-brain 1mm isotropic
diffusion imaging with high geometric fidelity and SNR efficiency. We finally
incorporate sinusoidal wave gradients during the EPI readout to better use coil
sensitivity encoding with controlled aliasing.

events. We follow the dynamical evolution of clusters in the galactic tidal
field. Due to tidal disruption, the cluster mass function evolves from initial
power law to a peaked shape. The surviving clusters at $z=0$ show a broad range
of metallicity [Fe/H] from -3 to -0.5. A robust prediction of the model is the
age--metallicity relation, in which metal-rich clusters are systematically

this explicitly for the Z and Higgs rapidity spectrum to NNLO, and we use it to
predict a nontrivial set of its N3LO contributions. Our factorization theorem
provides the relevant resummation of large-$x$ logarithms in the rapidity

linearly with time, this leads to systematic errors in the derived radial
velocities. The typical magnitude of this second-order effect is of order 10 cm
s$^{-1}$, but it depends on several parameters, e.g. the latitude of the
observatory, the position of the target on the sky, and the exposure time. We
show that there are realistic observing scenarios, where the errors can amount
to more than 1 ms$^{-1}$. We therefore recommend that instruments operating in
this regime always record and store the exposure meter flux curve (or a similar
measure) to be used as photon-weights for the barycentric correction. In
existing data, if the flux curve is no longer available, we argue that
second-order errors in the barycentric correction can be mitigated by adding a

multiple-eavesdropper (MIMOME) channels with arbitrary numbers of antennas at
each node is studied in this paper. First, the optimization problem
corresponding to the secrecy capacity of the MIMOME channel is converted to an
equivalent optimization based on Givens rotations and eigenvalue decomposition
of the covariance matrix. In this new formulation, precoder is a rotation
matrix which results in a positive semi-definite (PSD) covariance matrix by
construction. This removes the PSD matrix constraint and makes the problem
easier to tackle. Next, a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)-based
algorithm is developed to find the rotation and power allocation parameters.
Further, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based precoding is
used to initialize this algorithm. The proposed rotation-BFGS method provides
an efficient approach to find a near-optimal transmit strategy for the MIMOME
channel and outperforms various state-of-the-art analytical and numerical
methods. In particular, the rotation BFGS precoding achieves higher secrecy
rates than the celebrated GSVD precoding, with a reasonably higher
computational complexity. Extensive numerical results elaborate on the
effectiveness of the rotation-BFGS precoding. The new framework developed in
this paper can be applied to a variety of similar problems in the context of

a numerical method for this problem is that boundary layers occurring in the
convection-dominated case can lead to non-physical oscillations in the
numerical approximation, often referred to as Gibbs phenomena. The idea of this
article is to consider the approximation problem as a residual minimization in
dual norms in Lq-type Sobolev spaces, with 1 < q < $\infty$. We then apply a
non-standard, non-linear PetrovGalerkin discretization, that is applicable to
reflexive Banach spaces such that the space itself and its dual are strictly
convex. Similar to discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin methods, this method is based
on minimizing the residual in a dual norm. Replacing the intractable dual norm
by a suitable discrete dual norm gives rise to a non-linear inexact mixed
method. This generalizes the Petrov-Galerkin framework developed in the context
of discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin methods to more general Banach spaces. For the
convection-diffusion-reaction equation, this yields a generalization of a
similar approach from the L2-setting to the Lq-setting. A key advantage of
considering a more general Banach space setting is that, in certain cases, the
oscillations in the numerical approximation vanish as q tends to 1, as we will
demonstrate using a few simple numerical examples.

in the quantum regime by modeling a quantum version of a driven van der Pol
oscillator. We find the classical response survives down to one excitation
quantum. At very weak drives, genuine quantum features arise, including
diverging and negative susceptibilities. Further, the linear response is
greatly enhanced by using a strong incoherent pump. These results are largely
generic and can be probed in current experimental platforms suited for quantum
sensing.

materials with electronic band gaps that are highly sensitive to material
thickness and chemical composition. Here, we explore the tunability of the
electronic excitation spectrum in GaSe using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. The electronic structure of the material is modified by
$\textit{in-situ}$ potassium deposition as well as by forming
GaS$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ alloy compounds. We find that potassium decouples the
top-most tetra-layer of the GaSe unit cell, leading to a substantial change of
the dispersion around the valence band maximum (VBM). The observed band
dispersion of a single tetralayer is consistent with a transition from the
direct gap character of the bulk to the indirect gap character expected for
monolayer GaSe. Upon alloying with sulfur, we observe a phase transition from
AB to $\text{AA}^{\prime}$ stacking. Alloying also results in a rigid energy
shift of the VBM towards higher binding energies which correlates with a blue
shift in the luminescence. The increase of the band gap upon sulfur alloying
does not appear to change the dispersion or character of the VBM appreciably,
implying that it is possible to engineer the gap of these materials while
maintaining their salient electronic properties.

consists of multiple high-peak-gain beams to compensate the high pathloss at
the mmWave bands. These beams also have to point to different angular
directions, such that by performing beam searching over the codebook, a good
mmWave signal coverage over the full sphere around the terminal (spherical
coverage) can be achieved. A model-based beam codebook design that assumes
ideal omni-directional antenna pattern, and neglects the impact of terminal
housing around the antenna, does not work well because the radiation pattern of
a practical mmWave antenna combined with the impact of terminal housing is
highly irregular. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient data-driven
method to generate a beam codebook to boost the spherical coverage of mmWave
terminals. The method takes as inputs the measured or simulated electric field
response data of each antenna and provides the codebook according to the
requirements on the codebook size, spherical coverage, etc. The method can be
applied in a straightforward manner to different antenna type, antenna array
configuration, placement and terminal housing design. Our simulation results
show that the proposed method generates a codebook better than the benchmark
and 802.15.3c codebooks in terms of the spherical coverage.

environments requires significant computational resources. This is especially
true in environments with high degrees of aliasing, where many states share
nearly identical visual features. Minecraft is an exemplar of such an
environment. We hypothesize that interactive machine learning IML, wherein
human teachers play a direct role in training through demonstrations, critique,
or action advice, may alleviate agent susceptibility to aliasing. However,
interactive machine learning is only practical when the number of human
interactions is limited, requiring a balance between human teacher effort and
agent performance. We conduct experiments with two reinforcement learning
algorithms which enable human teachers to give action advice, Feedback
Arbitration and Newtonian Action Advice, under visual aliasing conditions. To
assess potential cognitive load per advice type, we vary the accuracy and
frequency of various human action advice techniques. Training efficiency,
robustness against infrequent and inaccurate advisor input, and sensitivity to
aliasing are examined.

a merger of gas-rich galaxies with infrared and radio activity. It has a
perturbed interstellar medium (ISM) and a dense configuration of gas and dust
around the nucleus. The radio emission at small ($\sim$100 pc) and large
($\sim$100 kpc) scales, as well as the large X-ray cavity in which the system
is embedded, are indicative of a jet that could have affected the ISM. We
carried out observations of the CO(1-0), (3-2), and (4-3) lines with the
Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to determine basic properties (i.e.,
extent, mass, and excitation) of the cold molecular gas in this system,
including its already-known wind. The CO emission reveals the presence of
gaseous streams related to the merger, which result in a small
($\sim$4kpc-wide) disk around the western nucleus. The disk reaches a
rotational velocity of 200 $kms^{-1}$ , and has a mass of
3.8($\pm$0.4)$\times$10${^9}M_{\odot}$. It is truncated at a gaseous ridge
north of the nucleus that is bright in [O III]. Regions with high-velocity CO
emission are seen at signal-to-noise ratios of between 3 and 5 along filaments
that radially extend from the nucleus to the ridge and that are bright in [O
III] and stellar emission. A tentative wind detection is also reported in the
nucleus and in the disk. The molecular gas speed could be as high as 2200
$kms^{-1}$ and the total wind mass could be as high as
1.5($\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^9M_{\odot}$. Energetically, it is possible that the
jet, assisted by the radiation pressure of the active nucleus or the stars,
accelerated clouds inside an expanding bubble.

from the coalescence of two compact objects in the mass range of neutron stars,
accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts, and offers an opportunity to
directly probe the internal structure of neutron stars. We perform Bayesian
model selection on a wide range of theoretical predictions for the neutron star
equation of state. For the binary neutron star hypothesis, we find that we
cannot rule out the majority of theoretical models considered. In addition, the
gravitational-wave data alone does not rule out the possibility that one or
both objects were low-mass black holes. We discuss the possible outcomes in the
case of a binary neutron star merger, finding that all scenarios from prompt
collapse to long-lived or even stable remnants are possible. For long-lived
remnants, we place an upper limit of 1.9 kHz on the rotation rate. If a black
hole was formed any time after merger and the coalescing stars were slowly
rotating, then the maximum baryonic mass of non-rotating neutron stars is at
most 3.05 $M_\odot$, and three equations of state considered here can be ruled
out. We obtain a tighter limit of 2.67 $M_\odot$ for the case that the merger
results in a hypermassive neutron star.

and very well connected to the parsec-scale field geometry seen in our earlier
optical polarization observations and the large-scale structure seen in Planck

Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi relation is $\rm 330\pm100~\mu$G which is more than
ten times of the value we obtained in the envelope (envelope in this paper is

satisfies $\overline{\mathrm{R}}_\epsilon(f^k) = \Theta(k \cdot

parallel and perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. Pairs of nearly degenerate
phonons were discovered and show either a 4-fold or 2-fold polarization angle
dependence in their Raman intensity, thereby providing evidence to definitively
assign the bulk crystal point group as C2h. The low frequency continuum that is
often attributed to scattering from pairs of Majorana fermions was also
examined and found to disappear when the laser excitation and scattered photon
polarizations were perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. This disappearance,
along with the behavior of the phonon spectrum in the same polarization
configuration, strongly suggests that the scattering continuum is

Kitaev magnetic interactions that survives up to room temperature, a scale
larger than the bare Kitaev exchange energy of approximately 50 K.

combining the idea of using the RK schemes at the boundary and an inverse
Lax-Wendroff procedure. The former preserves the accuracy of the RK schemes and
the latter guarantees the stability. Our method is different from the widely
used approach for the explicit RK schemes by imposing boundary conditions at
intermediate stages, which could not be derived for the IMEX schemes. In
addition, the intermediate boundary conditions are only available for explicit
RK schemes up to third order while our method applies to arbitrary order IMEX

theory in curved spacetime and in particular phenomena such as cosmological

account the backreaction of such effects on the metric requires an extension to
semiclassical gravity and leads to an apparent inconsistency in the theory: the
black hole evaporation induces a breakdown of the unitary quantum evolution
leading to the so called information loss problem. Here we show that analogue
gravity can provide an interesting perspective on the resolution of this
problem, albeit the backreaction in analogue systems is not described by
semiclassical Einstein equations. In particular, by looking at the simpler
problem of cosmological particle creation, we show, in the context of
Bose--Einstein condensates analogue gravity, that the emerging analogue
geometry and quasi-particles have correlations due to the quantum nature of the
atomic degrees of freedom underlying the emergent spacetime. The quantum
evolution is, of course, always unitary, but on the whole Hilbert space, which
cannot be exactly factorised a posteriori in geometry and quasi-particle
components. In analogy, in a black hole evaporation one should expect a
continuous process creating correlations between the Hawking quanta and the
microscopic quantum degrees of freedom of spacetime, implying so that only a
full quantum gravity treatment would be able to resolve the information loss

novel nuclear phenomena, such as ""hidden color"", ""color transparency"",

a mass scale can appear in the equations of motion without affecting the
conformal invariance of the Action. When one applies the dAFF procedure to the

patient population would have had if every patient had completed the trial. If
we only analyze the patients who complete the trial, then this missing data
problem biases the estimator of a medication's efficacy because study outcomes
are missing not at random (MNAR). One way to overcome this problem - the
trimmed means approach for missing data - sets missing values as slightly worse
than the worst observed outcome and then trims away a fraction of the
distribution from each treatment arm before calculating differences in
treatment efficacy (Permutt 2017, Pharmaceutical statistics 16.1:20-28). In
this paper we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for when this approach
can identify the average population treatment effect in the presence of MNAR
data. Numerical studies show the trimmed means approach's ability to
effectively estimate treatment efficacy when data are MNAR and missingness is
strongly associated with an unfavorable outcome, but trimmed means fail when
data are missing at random (MAR) when the better approach would be to multiply
impute the missing values. If the reasons for discontinuation in a clinical
trial are known analysts can improve estimates with a combination of multiple
imputation (MI) and the trimmed means approach when the assumptions of each
missing data mechanism hold. When the assumptions are justifiable, using
trimmed means can help identify treatment effects notwithstanding MNAR data.

which high dimensional data are governed by low dimensional time-varying
dynamics. We consider two classes of algorithms that rely on (i) a discount
factor on previous observations, and (ii) a sliding window of observations. Our
algorithms leverage existing techniques for incremental singular value
decomposition and allow us to determine an appropriately reduced model at each
time and are applicable even if data matrix is singular. We apply the developed
algorithms for autonomous systems to Electroencephalographic (EEG) data and
demonstrate their effectiveness in terms of reconstruction and prediction. Our
algorithms for non-autonomous systems are illustrated using randomly generated
linear time-varying systems.

messages requiring payments in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, also known as

cryptocurrencies by members of the spamming industry. Using a dataset of
4,340,736 sextortion spams, this research aims at understanding such new
amalgamation by uncovering spammers' operations. To do so, a simple, yet
effective method for projecting Bitcoin addresses mentioned in sextortion spams
onto transaction graph abstractions is computed over the entire Bitcoin
blockchain. This allows us to track and investigate monetary flows between
involved actors and gain insights into the financial structure of sextortion
campaigns. We find that sextortion spammers are somewhat sophisticated,
following pricing strategies and benefiting from cost reductions as their
operations cut the upper-tail of the spamming supply chain. We discover that
one single entity is likely controlling the financial backbone of the majority
of the sextortion campaigns and that the 11-month operation studied yielded a
lower-bound revenue between \$1,300,620 and \$1,352,266. We conclude that
sextortion spamming is a lucrative business and spammers will likely continue

density maps at near-atomic resolution. However, map validation is still an
open issue in the field. Despite several efforts from the community, it is
possible to overfit the reconstructions to noisy data. Here, inspired by modern
statistics, we develop a novel methodology that uses a small independent
particle set to validate the 3D maps. The main idea is to monitor how the map
probability evolves over the control set during the refinement. The method is
complementary to the gold-standard procedure, which generates two
reconstructions at each iteration. We low-pass filter the two reconstructions
for different frequency cutoffs, and we calculate the probability of each
filtered map given the control set. For high-quality maps, the probability
should increase as a function of the frequency cutoff and of the refinement
iteration. We also compute the similarity between the probability distributions
of the two reconstructions. As higher frequencies are added to the maps, more
dissimilar are the distributions. We optimized the BioEM software package to
perform these calculations, and tested the method on several systems, some
which were overfitted. Our results show that our method is able to discriminate
the overfitted sets from the non-overfitted ones. We conclude that having a
control particle set, not used for the refinement, is essential for
cross-validating cryo-EM maps.

where the Wiedemann-Franz law is recovered. Together with a quadratic
temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth up to T/T_c=0.3, these

superconducting order parameter with point nodes. Millikelvin specific heat
measurements performed on the same crystals used for thermal transport reveal
an upturn below 300 mK that is well described by a divergent quantum-critical

improved results by regressing likelihood maps instead of regressing the

targets during the training is a cumbersome process since it creates a
trade-off between trainability vs localization accuracy. Using precise targets
introduces a significant sampling bias and hence makes the training more
difficult, whereas using imprecise targets results in inaccurate landmark
detectors. In this paper, we introduce ""Adaloss"", an objective function that
adapts itself during the training by updating the target precision based on the
training statistics. This approach does not require setting problem-specific
parameters and shows improved stability in training and better localization
accuracy during inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed

related work accomplished by different authors in this domain. Main objective
of this paper is to propose an algorithm which can be used to generate musical
notes using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), principally Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks. A model is designed to execute this algorithm where data is
represented with the help of musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) file
format for easier access and better understanding. Preprocessing of data before
feeding it into the model, revealing methods to read, process and prepare MIDI
files for input are also discussed. The model used in this paper is used to
learn the sequences of polyphonic musical notes over a single-layered LSTM
network. The model must have the potential to recall past details of a musical
sequence and its structure for better learning. Description of layered
architecture used in LSTM model and its intertwining connections to develop a
neural network is presented in this work. This paper imparts a peek view of
distributions of weights and biases in every layer of the model along with a
precise representation of losses and accuracy at each step and batches. When
the model was thoroughly analyzed, it produced stellar results in composing new
melodies.

coefficient is not only determined by the bulk Seebeck values of the materials
but, in addition, is dependent on the energy relaxation process of charge
carriers as they propagate from the less-conductive barrier region into the
more-conductive well region. We calculate S as a function of the well size d,
where carrier energy becomes increasingly relaxed within the well for d greater
than l, where l is the energy relaxation length. We validate the model against
more advanced quantum transport simulations based on the nonequilibrium Green
function (NEGF) method and also with an experiment, and we find very good
agreement. In the case in which no energy relaxation is taken into account, the
results deviate substantially from the NEGF results. The model also yields
accurate results with only a small deviation (up to ~3%) when varying the
optical phonon energy hw or the e-ph coupling strength D0, physical parameters

the controller design by identifying controller behaviors that do not satisfy
requirements. The test cases can also enhance the testing phase of development
by identifying critical corner cases that correspond to the limits of the
system's allowed behaviors. We present STL requirements for an autonomous

systems, but deriving them from first principles involves a series of
compromises. On the one hand, the Redfield equation is valid for fast
environments (whose correlation function decays much faster than the system
relaxation time) regardless of the relative strength of the coupling to the
system Hamiltonian, but is notoriously non-completely-positive. On the other
hand, the Davies equation preserves complete positivity but is valid only in
the ultra-weak coupling limit and for systems with a finite level spacing,
which makes it incompatible with arbitrarily fast time-dependent driving. Here
we show that a recently derived Markovian coarse-grained master equation
(CGME), already known to be completely positive, has a much expanded range of
applicability compared to the Davies equation, and moreover, is locally
generated and can be generalized to accommodate arbitrarily fast driving. This
generalization, which we refer to as the time-dependent CGME, is thus suitable
for the analysis of fast operations in gate-model quantum computing, such as
quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling. Our derivation proceeds
directly from the Redfield equation and allows us to place rigorous error
bounds on all three equations: Redfield, Davies, and coarse-grained. Our main
result is thus a completely positive Markovian master equation that is a
controlled approximation to the true evolution for any time-dependence of the
system Hamiltonian, and works for systems with arbitrarily small level spacing.
We illustrate this with an analysis showing that dynamical decoupling can
extend coherence times even in a strictly Markovian setting.

this model suffers from the lack of interpretability and the item cold-start

propose an interpretable recommendation model called Multi-Matrix Factorization
(MMF), which addresses these two limitations and achieves the state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy by exploiting common attributes that are present in
different items. In the model, predicted item ratings are regarded as weighted
aggregations of attribute ratings generated by the inner product of the user
latent vectors and the attribute latent vectors. MMF provides more fine grained
analyses than matrix factorization in the following ways: attribute ratings
with weights allow the understanding of how much each attribute contributes to
the recommendation and hence provide interpretability; the common attributes
can act as a link between existing and new items, which solves the item
cold-start problem when no rating exists on an item. We evaluate the
interpretability of MMF comprehensively, and conduct extensive experiments on
real datasets to show that MMF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms
of accuracy.

misalignment and a slight decrease of ellipticity for fast rotators with

of different mass. It is also found that the number of very slow rotators with
large ellipticities is much larger than found in observations. The intrinsic

archival data, namely CDF-S XT1 and XT2. Whereas the nature of the former is
not identified, the latter was suggested as an excellent candidate for a
rapidly spinning magnetar born from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. Here we
propose a unified model to interpret both transients within the framework of
the BNS merger magnetar model. According to our picture, CDF-S XT2 is observed
from the ""free zone"" where the magnetar spindown powered X-ray emission escapes
freely, whereas CDF-S XT1 originates from the ""trapped zone"" where the X-ray
emission is initially blocked by the dynamical ejecta and becomes transparent
after the ejecta is pushed to a distance where Thomson optical depth drops
below unity. We fit the magnetar model to the light curves of both transients
and derived consistent parameters for the two events, with magnetic field,
initial spin period and X-ray emission efficiency being ($B_p=10^{16}\,G$,
$P=1.2\,\rm ms$, $\eta = 0.001$) and ($B_p=10^{15.8}\,G$, $P=4.4\, \rm ms$,
$\eta = 0.001$) for XT1 and XT2, respectively. The ""isotropic equivalent""
ejecta mass of XT1 is $M_{\rm ej} \sim 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$, while it is not
constrained for XT2. Our results suggest that more extreme magnetar parameters
are required to have XT1 detected from the trapped zone. The model parameters
for both events are generally consistent with those derived from SGRB X-ray
plateau observations. The host galaxy properties of both transients are also
consistent with those of SGRBs. The event rate densities of both XT1 and XT2

  for a set of words","17 pages, 4 tables",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A universal cycle, or u-cycle, for a given set of words is a circular word
that contains each word from the set exactly once as a contiguous subword. The
celebrated de Bruijn sequences are a particular case of such a u-cycle, where a
set in question is the set $A^n$ of all words of length $n$ over a $k$-letter
alphabet $A$. A universal word, or u-word, is a linear, i.e. non-circular,
version of the notion of a u-cycle, and it is defined similarly.
  Removing some words in $A^n$ may, or may not, result in a set of words for
which u-cycle, or u-word, exists. The goal of this paper is to study the
probability of existence of the universal objects in such a situation. We give
lower bounds for the probability in general cases, and also derive explicit
answers for the case of removing up to two words in $A^n$, or the case when
$k=2$ and $n\leq 4$.

planetary systems consisting of five planets, each equal in mass to the Earth,
orbiting a one solar mass star. All planets orbit in the same plane and in the
same direction, and the planets are uniformly spaced in units of mutual Hill
Sphere radii. Most of the systems that we integrate begin with one or more
planets on eccentric orbits, with eccentricities $e$ as large as $e= 0.05$
being considered. For a given initial orbital separation, larger initial
eccentricity of a single planet generally leads to shorter system lifetime,
with little systematic dependence of which planet is initially on an eccentric
orbit. The approximate trend of instability times increasing exponentially with
initial orbital separation of the planets found previously for planets with
initially circular orbits is also present for systems with initially eccentric
orbits. Mean motion resonances also tend to destabilize these systems, although
the reductions in system lifetimes are not as large as for initially circular
orbits. Systems with all planets having initial $e= 0.05$ and aligned periapse
angles typically survive far longer than systems with the same spacing in
initial semi-major axis and one planet with $e= 0.05$, but they have slightly
shorter lifetimes than those with planets initially on circular orbits.

photo-voltaic (PV) power generators can increase the risk of tripping events
due to voltage fluctuations. To quantify this risk utilities need to solve the
interactive equations of tripping events for networked PVs in real-time.
However, these equations are non-differentiable, nonlinear, and exponentially
complex, and thus, cannot be used as a tractable basis for solar curtailment
prediction and mitigation. Furthermore, load/PV power values might not be
available in real-time due to limited grid observability, which further
complicates tripping event prediction. To address these challenges, we have
employed Chebyshev's inequality to obtain an alternative probabilistic model
for quantifying the risk of tripping for networked PVs. The proposed model
enables operators to estimate the probability of interdependent inverter
tripping events using only PV/load statistics and in a scalable manner.
Furthermore, by integrating this probabilistic model into an optimization
framework, countermeasures are designed to mitigate massive interdependent
tripping events. Since the proposed model is parameterized using only the
statistical characteristics of nodal active/reactive powers, it is especially
beneficial in practical systems, which have limited real-time observability.
Numerical experiments have been performed employing real data and feeder models
to verify the performance of the proposed technique.

in the context of heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, and
estimate the sensitivity of large acceptance detectors, such as the ALICE
detector, towards the identification of such anomalous decays. Our study is
based on the robust statistical observable, $\nu_{\rm dyn}$, known for its
sensitivity to dynamical fluctuations. We first present simulations without
DCCs, based on the HIJING and AMPT models, in order to establish an approximate
reference for the magnitude of $\nu_{\rm dyn}({\rm K}^{\pm},{\rm K}^{0}_{s})$
and its centrality evolution in Pb--Pb collisions at the TeV energy scale. We
next introduce simple phenomenological models of K$^0_s$ vs. K$^\pm$
event-by-event yield fluctuations, which we use to study the feasibility and
sensitivity of detection of the production of DCCs in heavy-ion collisions.
Although the precision of models such as HIJING and AMPT limit their use as
absolute references and thus render anomalous fluctuations difficult to define
precisely, our studies demonstrate that the magnitude of $\nu_{\rm dyn}({\rm
K}^{\pm},{\rm K}^{0}_{s})$ is in fact very sensitive to the presence of small
admixture of DCCs in normal non-DCC events. Consequently, while large values of
$\nu_{\rm dyn}({\rm K}^{\pm},{\rm K}^{0}_{s})$ may not be sufficient to
identify the existence of DCCs, nonetheless they constitute a first and
necessary condition to signal their possible production in heavy-ion
collisions.

exploration and exploitation. We study the effects of competition and
cooperation on this tradeoff. Suppose there are $k$ arms and two players, Alice
and Bob. In every round, each player pulls an arm, receives the resulting
reward, and observes the choice of the other player but not their reward.
Alice's utility is $\Gamma_A + \lambda \Gamma_B$ (and similarly for Bob), where
$\Gamma_A$ is Alice's total reward and $\lambda \in [-1, 1]$ is a cooperation
parameter. At $\lambda = -1$ the players are competing in a zero-sum game, at
$\lambda = 1$, they are fully cooperating, and at $\lambda = 0$, they are
neutral: each player's utility is their own reward. The model is related to the
economics literature on strategic experimentation, where usually players
observe each other's rewards.
  With discount factor $\beta$, the Gittins index reduces the one-player
problem to the comparison between a risky arm, with a prior $\mu$, and a
predictable arm, with success probability $p$. The value of $p$ where the
player is indifferent between the arms is the Gittins index $g = g(\mu,\beta) >
m$, where $m$ is the mean of the risky arm.
  We show that competing players explore less than a single player: there is
$p^* \in (m, g)$ so that for all $p > p^*$, the players stay at the predictable
arm. However, the players are not myopic: they still explore for some $p > m$.
On the other hand, cooperating players explore more than a single player. We
also show that neutral players learn from each other, receiving strictly higher
total rewards than they would playing alone, for all $ p\in (p^*, g)$, where
$p^*$ is the threshold from the competing case.
  Finally, we show that competing and neutral players eventually settle on the
same arm in every Nash equilibrium, while this can fail for cooperating
players.

approximation of the Riemann-Liouville fractional operator $I^{\alpha}$ at node
$x_{n}$. In this paper, we develop the shifted convolution quadrature ($SCQ$)
theory which generalizes the theory of convolution quadrature by introducing a
shifted parameter $\theta$ to cover as many numerical schemes that approximate
the operator $I^{\alpha}$ with an integer convergence rate as possible. The
constraint on the parameter $\theta$ is discussed in detail and the phenomenon
of superconvergence for some schemes is examined from a new perspective. For
some technique purposes when analysing the stability or convergence estimates
of a method applied to PDEs, we design some novel formulas with desired
properties under the framework of the $SCQ$. Finally, we conduct some numerical
tests with nonsmooth solutions to further confirm our theory.

the VVV (VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea) aperture photometry of the
stars in the region $|l|\lesssim2^\circ.0$ and
$0^\circ.5\lesssim|b|\lesssim1^\circ.0$; this region consists of 12 VVV tiles.
We have found significant systematic discrepancy up to $\sim0.1$ mag between
the stellar magnitudes of the same stars in overlapping VVV tiles. However, by
carefully using the positions of red clump stars in color-magnitude diagrams as
a tracer of the extinction and reddening, we are able to determine the average
of the ratios of total to selective extinction to be $A(K_{\mathrm
S})/E(H-K_{\mathrm S})=1.44\pm0.04$, $A(K_{\mathrm S})/E(J-K_{\mathrm
S})=0.423\pm0.024$, $A(H)/E(J-H)=1.25\pm0.04$; from these ratios, a steep power
law $A(\lambda)\propto\lambda^{-\alpha}$ whose index $\alpha$ is $\sim2.0-2.3$
in the $J,H,K_{\mathrm S}$ wavelength range is estimated. The obtained
wavelength dependence is consistent with those obtained with the MKO
photometric system employed in SIRIUS camera attached to the IRSF telescope in
previous studies. Such a steep decline of extinction toward the longer
wavelengths is also in line with recent results based on deep imaging surveys.
The determined extinction law seems to be variable in the VVV tile to tile, and
it is not clear how much of this is due to real sight line variations and due
to observational systematic effects. Thus, there might be room for improvement
of the extinction law determination from the existing VVV data, but this steep
extinction law tends to locate heavily reddened objects in the Galactic plane
more distant from us when their distance moduli are calculated from the
observed reddening values.

findings indicate that the intrinsic micromotion of the ion is not detrimental

different parts of the surface Brillouin zone. Despite the dramatic surface
evolution, the existence of SFAs is robust and each SFA remains tied to a pair
of Weyl points of opposite chirality, as dictated by the bulk topology.

to the brain tissue thus forming a lesion. A lesion is zoned into a core
associated with irreversible necrosis typically located at the center of the
lesion, while reversible hypoxic changes in the outer regions of the lesion are
termed as the penumbra. Early estimation of core and penumbra in ischaemic
stroke is crucial for timely intervention with thrombolytic therapy to reverse
the damage and restore normalcy. Multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is commonly employed for clinical diagnosis. However, a sequence singly has not
been found to be sufficiently able to differentiate between core and penumbra,
while a combination of sequences is required to determine the extent of the
damage. The challenge, however, is that with an increase in the number of
sequences, it cognitively taxes the clinician to discover symptomatic
biomarkers in these images. In this paper, we present a data-driven fully
automated method for estimation of core and penumbra in ischaemic lesions using
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) sequence
maps of MRI. The method employs recent developments in convolutional neural
networks (CNN) for semantic segmentation in medical images. In the absence of
availability of a large amount of labeled data, the CNN is trained using an
adversarial approach employing cross-entropy as a segmentation loss along with
losses aggregated from three discriminators of which two employ relativistic
visual Turing test. This method is experimentally validated on the ISLES-2015

has a characterisation as the maximal logic above $\bigcup_{\lambda<\kappa}
L_{\lambda, \omega}$ satisfying Strong Undefinability of Well Order (SUDWO).
SUDWO is a strengthening of the Undefinability of Well Order (UDWO). We prove
that if $\kappa$ is singular of countable cofinality, Karp's chain logic
\cite{Karpintroduceschain} is above $L^1_\kappa$, while it is already known
that it satisfies UDWO and Interpolation. Moreover, we show that in these
circumstances, the chain logic is -- in a sense -- maximal among logics with
chain models to satisfy UDWO. We then show that the chain logic gives a partial
solution to Problem 1.4. from Shelah's \cite{Sh797}, which asked whether for
$\kappa$ singular of countable cofinality there was a logic strictly between $
L_{\kappa^+, \omega}$ and $L_{\kappa^+, \kappa^+}$ having Interpolation. We
show that modulo accepting as the upper bound a model class of $L_{\kappa,
\kappa}$, Karp's chain logic satisfies the required properties. In addition, we
show that this chain logic is not $\kappa$-compact, a question that we have
asked on various occasions. We contribue to the further development of chain
logic by proving the Union Lemma and identifying the chain-independent fragment
of the logic, showing that it still has considerable expressive power. In
conclusion, we have shown that the simply defined chain logic emulates the
logic $L^1_\kappa$ in satisfying Interpolation, undefinability of well-order
and maximality with respect to it, and the Union Lemma. In addition it has a
Completeness Theorem.

mechanical system in direct interaction with a beam of light. In this

wavelength of the trapping beam are important. Different beams are associated
with different momentum transfer, trap stiffness and stabilisation properties,
for example. One method to determine the best beam profile is through the use
of the optical eigenmode approach. To use this method, we employ Mie scattering
theory which enables the exact determination of the scattered field as a
function of the incident field. More precisely, this approach allows us to
calculate the Hermitian relationship between the incident field and the optical
forces acting on the scattering objects. This Hermitian relationship defines
also a set of orthogonal optical eigenmodes which deliver a natural basis to
describe momentum transfer in light-matter interactions. This relationship
defines also a set of orthogonal optical eigenmodes. Using these modes it is
possible to define, for each numerical aperture, particle size or geometry, the

applications, and most proposed algorithms rely on local features extracted
from recorded images. For better performance, the features used for open-loop
localization are required to be short-term globally static, and the ones used
for re-localization or loop closure detection need to be long-term static.
Therefore, the motion attribute of a local feature point could be exploited to
improve localization performance, e.g., the feature points extracted from
moving persons or vehicles can be excluded from these systems due to their
unsteadiness. In this paper, we design a fully convolutional network (FCN),
named MD-Net, to perform motion attribute estimation and feature description
simultaneously. MD-Net has a shared backbone network to extract features from
the input image and two network branches to complete each sub-task. With
MD-Net, we can obtain the motion attribute while avoiding increasing much more
computation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can
learn distinct local feature descriptor along with motion attribute only using
an FCN, by outperforming competing methods by a wide margin. We also show that
the proposed algorithm can be integrated into a vision-based localization
algorithm to improve estimation accuracy significantly.

particularly in terms of delay and reliability. In this paper, a dependence
control mechanism is proposed to improve the overall reliability of vehicular
networks. In particular, the dependence between the communication delays of
different vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links is first modeled. Then, the concept of
a concordance order, stemming from stochastic ordering theory, is introduced to
show that a higher dependence can lead to a better reliability. Using this
insight, a power allocation problem is formulated to maximize the concordance,
thereby optimizing the overall communication reliability of the V2V system. To
obtain an efficient solution to the power allocation problem, a dual update
method is introduced. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of performing
dependence control for reliability optimization in a vehicular network, and
show that the proposed mechanism can achieve up to 25% reliability gain

fully determines the properties of each macromolecule, such as its elasticity
and its folding behaviour. Typically, experimental bottle brushes are systems
made of tens of thousands of monomeric units, rendering a computational
approach extremely expensive, especially in the case of bottle brush solutions.
A proper coarse graining description of these macromolecules thus appears
essential. We present here a theoretical approach able to develop a general,
transferable and analytical multi-scale coarse graining of homopolymeric bottle
brush polymers under good solvent conditions. Starting from scaling theories,
each macromolecule is mapped onto a chain of tethered star polymers, whose
effective potential is known from scaling predictions, computational and
experimental validations and can be expressed as a function of the number of
arms f, and the length na of each arm. Stars are then tethered to one another
and the effective potential between them is shown to only depend on the key
parameters of the original bottle brush polymer ({\sigma}g, ns). The
generalised form of the effective potential is then used to reproduce
properties of the macromolecules obtained both with scaling theories and with
simulations. The general form of the effective potentials derived in the
current study allows a theoretical and computational description of the
properties of homopolymeric bottle brush polymers for all grafting densities

abnormally only when an input data sample with a particular trigger present is
fed to that model. As such, given a deep neural network model and clean input
samples, it is very challenging to inspect and determine the existence of a
trojan backdoor. Recently, researchers design and develop several pioneering
solutions to address this acute problem. They demonstrate the proposed
techniques have a great potential in trojan detection. However, we show that
none of these existing techniques completely address the problem. On the one
hand, they mostly work under an unrealistic assumption (e.g. assuming
availability of the contaminated training database). On the other hand, the
proposed techniques cannot accurately detect the existence of trojan backdoors,
nor restore high-fidelity trojan backdoor images, especially when the triggers
pertaining to the trojan vary in size, shape and position. In this work, we
propose TABOR, a new trojan detection technique. Conceptually, it formalizes a
trojan detection task as a non-convex optimization problem, and the detection
of a trojan backdoor as the task of resolving the optimization through an
objective function. Different from the existing technique also modeling trojan
detection as an optimization problem, TABOR designs a new objective
function--under the guidance of explainable AI techniques as well as
heuristics--that could guide optimization to identify a trojan backdoor in a
more effective fashion. In addition, TABOR defines a new metric to measure the
quality of a trojan backdoor identified. Using an anomaly detection method, we

with the potential to simultaneously achieve a broad spectral coverage and
ultrahigh spectral resolution in terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. However, the
need for two independently stabilized ultrafast lasers significantly hampers
the potential application of DCS techniques. In this article, we demonstrate
mode-resolved DCS in the THz region based on a free-running single-cavity
dual-comb fiber laser with adaptive sampling. Low-pressure spectroscopy of
acetonitrile gas with absorption features approaching the Doppler limit is
demonstrated by comb-mode-resolved measurements with a spectral sampling
spacing of 48.8 MHz, a spectral resolution of less than 5 MHz and a
signal-to-noise ratio of ~50 dB. The successful demonstration of the proposed
method clearly indicates the great potential for the realization of
low-complexity, MHz-resolution THz spectroscopy instrumentation.

hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory

directed-acyclic-graph LSTM (DAG-LSTM) for DA classification. A DAG-LSTM
exploits the turn-taking structure naturally present in a multi-party

with spatially-varying birefringence is placed in the pupil plane to encode
polarization information into the point-spread function (PSF) of an imaging
system. In this work, a variational calculation is performed to find the
optimal birefringence distribution that effectively encodes polarization
information while producing the smallest possible PSF, thus maximizing the
resolution for imaging polarimetry. This optimal solution is found to be nearly
equivalent to the birefringence distribution that results from a glass window
being subjected to three uniformly spaced stress points at its edges, which has
been used in previous star test polarimetry setups.

sequence of problems represented by their related skills. This involves
abstract concepts of students' states of knowledge and the interactions between
those states and skills. Therefore, a KT model is designed to predict whether
students will give correct answers and to describe such abstract concepts.
However, existing methods either give relatively low prediction accuracy or
fail to explain those concepts intuitively. In this paper, we propose a new
model called Knowledge Query Network (KQN) to solve these problems. KQN uses
neural networks to encode student learning activities into knowledge state and
skill vectors, and models the interactions between the two types of vectors
with the dot product. Through this, we introduce a novel concept called
\textit{probabilistic skill similarity} that relates the pairwise cosine and
Euclidean distances between skill vectors to the odds ratios of the
corresponding skills, which makes KQN interpretable and intuitive.
  On four public datasets, we have carried out experiments to show the
following: 1. KQN outperforms all the existing KT models based on prediction
accuracy. 2. The interaction between the knowledge state and skills can be
visualized for interpretation. 3. Based on probabilistic skill similarity, a
skill domain can be analyzed with clustering using the distances between the
skill vectors of KQN. 4. For different values of the vector space
dimensionality, KQN consistently exhibits high prediction accuracy and a strong
positive correlation between the distance matrices of the skill vectors.

simulating of fourth order dynamical object with various eigenvalues. This
example shows that developed parallel model is stable, well-convergent, and
high-accuracy model. There is no defined any calculation errors between
well-known serial model and proposed parallel one. Nevertheless, the proposed

blue-links and heterogeneous modules (such as news, images, and videos).
Existing studies have largely ignored the correlations between blue-links and
heterogeneous modules when selecting the heterogeneous modules to be presented.
We observe that the top ranked blue-links, which we refer to as the
\emph{context}, can provide important information about query intent and helps
identify the relevant heterogeneous modules. For example, informative terms
like ""streamed"" and ""recorded"" in the context imply that a video module may
better satisfy the query. To model and utilize the context information for
aggregated search, we propose a model with context attention and representation
learning (CARL). Our model applies a recurrent neural network with an attention
mechanism to encode the context, and incorporates the encoded context
information into module embeddings. The context-aware module embeddings
together with the ranking policy are jointly optimized under the Markov
decision process (MDP) formulation. To achieve a more effective joint learning,
we further propose an optimization function with self-supervision loss to
provide auxiliary supervision signals. Experimental results based on two public
datasets demonstrate the superiority of CARL over multiple baseline approaches,
and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimization function in boosting
the joint learning process.

This minimal criterion is uniquely challenging for the study of consciousness,
as we do not know if it is possible to confirm via observation from the outside
whether or not a physical system knows what it feels like to have an inside - a
challenge referred to as the ""hard problem"" of consciousness. To arrive at a
theory of consciousness, the hard problem has motivated the development of
phenomenological approaches that adopt assumptions of what properties
consciousness has based on first-hand experience and, from these, derive the
physical processes that give rise to these properties. A leading theory
adopting this approach is Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which assumes
our subjective experience is a ""unified whole"", subsequently yielding a
requirement for physical feedback as a necessary condition for consciousness.
Here, we develop a mathematical framework to assess the validity of this
assumption by testing it in the context of isomorphic physical systems with and
without feedback. The isomorphism allows us to isolate changes in $\Phi$
without affecting the size or functionality of the original system. Indeed, we
show that the only mathematical difference between a ""conscious"" system with
$\Phi>0$ and an isomorphic ""philosophical zombies"" with $\Phi=0$ is a
permutation of the binary labels used to internally represent functional
states. This implies $\Phi$ is sensitive to functionally arbitrary aspects of a
particular labeling scheme, with no clear justification in terms of
phenomenological differences. In light of this, we argue any quantitative
theory of consciousness, including IIT, should be invariant under isomorphisms
if it is to avoid the existence of isomorphic philosophical zombies and the
epistemological problems they pose.
