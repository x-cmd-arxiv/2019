We explore the ensuing possibilities for a Floquet topological insulator with

counterpropagating boundary states can be tailored in ways that overcome the

specifically enables the enhancement of boundary transport relative to bulk

parameters of the standard LCDM model, we also simultaneously vary the dark
energy equation of state, the neutrino mass, the neutrino effective number, the
running of the spectral index and the lensing amplitude $A_L$. We confirm that
a resolution of the Hubble tension is given by a dark energy equation of state
with w<-1, ruling out quintessence models at high statistical significance.
This solution is, however, not supported by BAO and Pantheon data. We find no
evidence for evolving dark energy, i.e. $w_a \neq 0$. The neutrino effective
number is always in agreement with the expectations of the standard model based
on three active neutrinos. The running of the spectral index also is always
consistent with zero. Despite the increase in the number of parameters, the
$A_L$ lensing anomaly is still present at more than two standard deviations.
The $A_L$ anomaly significantly affects the bounds on the neutrino mass that
can be larger by a factor four with respect to those derived under standard

as Ta, Pt, and W, where spins are polarized in the surface plane and
perpendicular to the charge current direction. Spins generated in these
materials have successfully switched magnets with in-plane magnetic anisotropy
(IMA) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) through spin orbit torque
(SOT) mechanism. It is generally accepted that PMA magnets are preferred over
IMA magnets in data storage applications owing to their large thermal stability
even at ultra scaled dimensions. However, SOT switching of PMA magnets by
conventional GSHE materials requires either a small external magnetic field, a
local dipolar field, or introducing tilted anisotropy to break the symmetry
with respect to the magnetization. To deterministically switch a PMA without
any additional assistance, nonconventional GSHE materials that can generate
spins with polarization perpendicular to the surfaces are needed. Several
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been predicted to
generate such out of plane spins due to their 2D nature and unique band
structures. Interestingly, opposite spins are locked to their respective
sub-band in each K valley of the TMD valence band with substantially large
energy splitting, which enables polarized spins to be accessible through
electrical gating and spatially separated by electric field through the valley
Hall effect (VHE). Therefore, spatial separation and accumulation of spins in
these 2D TMDs are uniquely referred to as coupled valley and spin Hall effect.
Here, we report an experiment of electrical generation of spin current with out
of plane polarization in monolayer WSe2 and detection of spin signals through a
nonlocal spin valve structure built on a lateral graphene spin diffusion
channel that partially overlaps with WSe2.

variable to fit. The discreteness implies that a power law in one of the
representations is not a power law in the other, and vice versa. We generate
synthetic power laws in both representations and apply a state-of-the-art
fitting method (based on maximum-likelihood plus a goodness-of-fit test) for
each of the two random variables. It is important to stress that the method
does not fit the whole distribution, but the tail, understood as the part of a

the representation in terms of the distribution of sizes leads to the recovery

light-matter interactions, especially for realistic molecular systems. However,
there is no unique semiclassical scheme. On the one hand, intermolecular
interactions can be described instantaneously by static two-body interactions
connecting different molecules plus a classical transverse E-field; we will
call this Hamiltonian #I. On the other hand, intermolecular interactions can
also be described as effects that are mediated exclusively through a classical
one-body E-field without any quantum effects at all (assuming we ignore
electronic exchange); we will call this Hamiltonian #II. Moreover, one can also
mix these two Hamiltonians into a third, hybrid Hamiltonian, which preserves
quantum electron-electron correlations for lower excitations but describes
higher excitations in a mean-field way. To investigate which semiclassical
scheme is most reliable for practical use, here we study the real-time dynamics
of a pair of identical two-level systems (TLSs) undergoing either resonance
energy transfer (RET) or collectively driven dynamics. While all approaches
perform reasonably well when there is no strong external excitation, we find
that no single approach is perfect for all conditions. Each method has its own
distinct problems: Hamiltonian #I performs best for RET but behaves in a
complicated manner for driven dynamics. Hamiltonian #II is always stable, but
obviously fails for RET at short distances. One key finding is that, under
externally driving, a full configuration interaction description of Hamiltonian
#I strongly overestimates the long-time electronic energy, highlighting the not
obvious fact that, if one plans to merge quantum molecules with classical
light, a full, exact treatment of electron-electron correlations can actually
lead to worse results than a simple mean-field treatment.

(OP) is an algorithm that generates near-optimal control inputs for generic

therefore relevant for the near-optimal control of nonlinear switched systems,
for which the switching signal is the control. However, OP exhibits several
limitations, which prevent its application in a standard control context.
First, it requires the stage cost to take values in [0,1], an unnatural
prerequisite as it excludes, for instance, quadratic stage costs. Second, it
requires the cost function to be discounted. Third, it applies for reward
maximization, and not cost minimization. In this paper, we modify OP to
overcome these limitations, and we call the new algorithm OPmin. We then make
stabilizability and detectability assumptions, under which we derive
near-optimality guarantees for OPmin and we show that the obtained bound has
major advantages compared to the bound originally given by OP. In addition, we
prove that a system whose inputs are generated by OPmin in a receding-horizon
fashion exhibits stability properties. As a result, OPmin provides a new tool

the null hypothesis of randomness (i.e., that trials are i.i.d.) based on test
statistics that compare the proportion of successes that directly follow k
consecutive successes with either the overall proportion of successes or the
proportion of successes that directly follow k consecutive failures. We
characterize the asymptotic distributions of these test statistics and their
permutation distributions under randomness, under a set of general stationary
processes, and under a class of Markov chain alternatives, which allow us to
derive their local asymptotic power. The results are applied to evaluate the
empirical support for the hot hand fallacy provided by four controlled
basketball shooting experiments. We establish that substantially larger data
sets are required to derive an informative measurement of the deviation from
randomness in basketball shooting. In one experiment, for which we were able to
obtain data, multiple testing procedures reveal that one shooter exhibits a
shooting pattern significantly inconsistent with randomness - supplying strong
evidence that basketball shooting is not random for all shooters all of the
time. However, we find that the evidence against randomness in this experiment
is limited to this shooter. Our results provide a mathematical and statistical
foundation for the design and validation of experiments that directly compare

implement on new parallel hardware such as GPUs because of three challenges:
(1) the difficulty of coming up with graph building blocks, (2) load imbalance
on parallel hardware, and (3) graph problems having low arithmetic intensity.
To address some of these challenges, GraphBLAS is an innovative, on-going
effort by the graph analytics community to propose building blocks based on
sparse linear algebra, which will allow graph algorithms to be expressed in a
performant, succinct, composable and portable manner. In this paper, we examine
the performance challenges of a linear-algebra-based approach to building graph
frameworks and describe new design principles for overcoming these bottlenecks.
Among the new design principles is exploiting input sparsity, which allows
users to write graph algorithms without specifying push and pull direction.
Exploiting output sparsity allows users to tell the backend which values of the
output in a single vectorized computation they do not want computed.
Load-balancing is an important feature for balancing work amongst parallel
workers. We describe the important load-balancing features for handling graphs
with different characteristics. The design principles described in this paper
have been implemented in ""GraphBLAST"", the first high-performance linear
algebra-based graph framework on NVIDIA GPUs that is open-source. The results
show that on a single GPU, GraphBLAST has on average at least an order of
magnitude speedup over previous GraphBLAS implementations SuiteSparse and GBTL,
comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives and
shared-memory graph frameworks Ligra and Gunrock, and better performance than
any other GPU graph framework, while offering a simpler and more concise

maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs), information measures and information loss
associated with conditioning in group sequential designs (GSDs). The
possibility of early stopping brings truncation to the distributional form of
MLEs; sequentially, GSD decisions eliminate some events from the sample space.
Multiple testing induces mixtures on the adapted sample space. Distributions of
MLEs are mixtures of truncated distributions. Test statistics that are
asymptotically normal without GSD, have asymptotic distributions, under GSD,
that are non-normal mixtures of truncated normal distributions under local
alternatives; under fixed alternatives, asymptotic distributions of test
statistics are degenerate. Estimation of various statistical quantities such as
information, information fractions, and confidence intervals should account for
the effect of planned adaptations. Calculation of adapted information fractions
requires substantial computational effort. Therefore, a new GSD is proposed in
which stage-specific sample sizes are fully determined by desired operational
characteristics, and calculation of information fractions is not needed.

scenarios where the magnetic Reynolds is very large. Numerically, these cases
can be studied efficiently by means of Large Eddy Simulations, in which the
computational resources are used to evolve the system only up to a finite grid
size. The resolution is not fine enough to capture all the relevant small-scale
physics at play, which is instead effectively modeled by a set of additional
terms in the evolution equations, dubbed as sub-grid-scale model. Here we
extend such approach, commonly used in
non-relativistic/non-magnetic/incompressible fluid dynamics, applying the
so-called gradient model to a general set of balance-law equations, that
includes the relevant case in which a non-trivial inversion of conserved to
primitive fields is needed. In particular, we focus on the relativistic
compressible ideal MHD scenario, providing for the first time (and for any
equation of state) all the additional sub-grid-scale terms. As an application,
we consider box simulations of the relativistic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,
which is also the first mechanism responsible for the magnetic field
amplification in binary neutron star mergers and cannot yet be fully captured
by the finest-grid and longest simulations available. The performance of our
model is numerically assessed by comparing it to the residuals arising from the
filtering of high-resolution simulations. We find that the model can fit very
well those residuals from resolutions a few times higher. Although the
application shown here explicitly considers the Minkowski metric, it can be
directly extended to general relativity, thus settling the basis to implement
the gradient sub-grid model in a GRMHD binary merger. Our results suggest that
this approach will be potentially able to unveil much better the small-scale
dynamics achievable in full GRMHD simulations.

  Model",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Euler's elastica model has been extensively studied and applied to image
processing tasks. However, due to the high nonlinearity and nonconvexity of the
involved curvature term, conventional algorithms suffer from slow convergence
and high computational cost. Various fast algorithms have been proposed, among
which, the augmented Lagrangian based ones are very popular in the community.
However, parameter tuning might be very challenging for these methods. In this
paper, a simple cutting-off strategy is introduced into the augmented
Lagrangian based algorithms for minimizing the Euler's elastica energy, which
leads to easy parameter tuning and fast convergence. The cutting-off strategy
is based on an observation of inconsistency inside the augmented Lagrangian
based algorithms. When the weighting parameter of the curvature term goes to
zero, the energy functional boils down to the ROF model. So, a natural
requirement is that its augmented Lagrangian based algorithms should also
approach the augmented Lagrangian based algorithms formulated directly for
solving the ROF model from the very beginning. Unfortunately, this is not the
case for certain existing augmented Lagrangian based algorithms. The proposed
cutting-off strategy helps to decouple the tricky dependence between the
auxiliary splitting variables, so as to remove the observed inconsistency.
Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm enjoys easier
parameter-tuning, faster convergence and even higher quality of image
restorations.

galaxies at the epoch of reionization. However, the origin of their radiative
properties has not been fully understood yet. Combining cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer calculations, we present
theoretical predictions of multi-wavelength radiative properties of the first
galaxies at z=6-15. We find that most of the gas and dust are ejected from
star-forming regions due to supernova (SN) feedback, which allows UV photons to
escape. We show that the peak of SED rapidly shifts between UV and infrared
wavelengths on a timescale of 100 Myr due to intermittent star formation and
feedback. When dusty gas covers the star-forming regions, the galaxies become
bright in the observed-frame sub-millimeter wavelengths. In addition, we find
that the escape fraction of ionizing photons also changes between 1-40% at
z>10. The mass fraction of HII region changes with the star formation history,
resulting in the fluctuations of metal lines and Lyman-alpha line luminosities.
In the starbursting phase of galaxies with the halo mass $\sim 10^{11}\,{\rm
M_{\odot}}$ ($10^{12}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$), the simulated galaxy has $L_{\rm
[O\,III]} \sim 10^{42}\, (10^{43})\, {\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, which is consistent
with the observed star-forming galaxies at z>7. Our simulations suggest that
deep [C II] observation with ALMA can trace the distribution of neutral gas
extending over $\sim 20$ physical kpc. We also find that the luminosity ratio
$L_{\rm [O\,III]}/L_{\rm [C\,II]}$ decreases with bolometric luminosity due to
metal enrichment. Our simulations show that the combination of multi-wavelength
observations by ALMA and JWST will be able to reveal the multi-phase ISM
structure and the transition from starbursting to outflowing phases of high-z
galaxies.

a discriminative correlation filter framework. The feature representations and
the correlation filter are jointly learnt to enhance to each other via a fast

are likely rotating rapidly, we continue our earlier study on the
generalization of the Kozai-Lidov formalism to include the spin of the SMBH and
study the evolution of a nearby BBH. We find that the eccentricity and orbital
inclination of the BBH is significantly affected, because the spin (i) forces
the orbital plane of the center-of-mass of the BBH around the SMBH to precess
(the Lense-Thirring effect) and (ii) imposes an additional gravitomagnetic
force on the BBH. As a result, the merger time of the BBH could be
significantly different. We calculate the waveform from the BBH in one
representative example and study its detectability by a milli-Hertz GW
detector, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We find that
the signal is distinguishable from that in the case without spin. Our results
imply that the BBHs in the LISA band could potentially be used to probe the

risks data. Due to the complexity of models for such data, we adapt the
simulated potential confounders approach of Carnegie et al. (2016), which
provides a general tool for sensitivity analysis due to unmeasured confounding.
More specifically, we specify one sensitivity parameter to quantify the
association between an unmeasured confounder and the treatment assignment, and
another set of parameters to quantify the association between the confounder
and the time-to-event outcomes. By varying the magnitudes of the sensitivity
parameters, we estimate the treatment effect of interest using the stochastic
EM and the EM algorithms. We demonstrate the performance of our methods on
simulated data, and apply them to a comparative effectiveness study in

Topological information is extensively used for 2D marker detection, and
further corresponding geometrical information for ID decoding. Robust 3D pose
estimation is achieved by taking advantage of all TopoTag vertices. Without
sacrificing bits for higher recall and precision like previous systems, TopoTag
can use full bits for ID encoding. TopoTag supports tens of thousands unique
IDs and easily extends to millions of unique tags resulting in massive
scalability. We collected a large test dataset including in total 169,713
images for evaluation, involving in-plane and out-of-plane rotation, image
blur, different distances and various backgrounds, etc. Experiments on the
dataset and real indoor and outdoor scene tests with a rolling shutter camera
both show that TopoTag significantly outperforms previous fiducial marker
systems in terms of various metrics, including detection accuracy, vertex
jitter, pose jitter and accuracy, etc. In addition, TopoTag supports occlusion
as long as the main tag topological structure is maintained and allows for
flexible shape design where users can customize internal and external marker
shapes. Code for our marker design/generation, marker detection, and dataset

In recent years, two complementary modalities have been added; phase contrast

structures respectively. These three modalities can be accessed using a crystal
analyser, a grating interferometer or by looking at a directly-resolved grid,
grating or speckle pattern. Grating and grid-based methods extract a
differential phase signal by measuring how far a feature in the illumination
has been shifted transversely due to the presence of a sample. The dark-field
signal is extracted by measuring how the visibility of the structured
illumination is decreased, typically due to the presence of sub-pixel
structures in a sample. The strength of the dark-field signal may depend on the
grating period, the pixel size and the set-up distances, and additional
dark-field signal contributions may be seen as a result of strong phase effects
or other factors. In this paper we show that the finite-difference form of the

  Workshop (SSW10)",,,,"cs.SD cs.CR cs.LG eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a new voice impersonation attack using voice conversion
(VC). Enrolling personal voices for automatic speaker verification (ASV) offers
natural and flexible biometric authentication systems. Basically, the ASV
systems do not include the users' voice data. However, if the ASV system is
unexpectedly exposed and hacked by a malicious attacker, there is a risk that
the attacker will use VC techniques to reproduce the enrolled user's voices. We
name this the ``verification-to-synthesis (V2S) attack'' and propose VC
training with the ASV and pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models
and without the targeted speaker's voice data. The VC model reproduces the
targeted speaker's individuality by deceiving the ASV model and restores
phonetic property of an input voice by matching phonetic posteriorgrams
predicted by the ASR model. The experimental evaluation compares converted
voices between the proposed method that does not use the targeted speaker's
voice data and the standard VC that uses the data. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method performs comparably to the existing VC
methods that trained using a very small amount of parallel voice data.

a reliable manner. We not only formalize this fundamental problem, but also
establish lower bounds on the complexity of this problem under crash failures

regions of a disaster-affected area in a timely fashion. The extensive spread
and reach of social media and networks allow people to share information in
real-time. However, the processing of social media data and gathering of
valuable information require a series of operations such as (1) processing each
specific tweet for a text classification, (2) possible location determination
of people needing help based on tweets, and (3) priority calculations of rescue
tasks based on the classification of tweets. These are three primary challenges
in developing an effective rescue scheduling operation using social media data.
In this paper, first, we propose a deep learning model combining attention
based Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) and Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to classify the tweets under different categories. We use
pre-trained crisis word vectors and global vectors for word representation
(GLoVe) for capturing semantic meaning from tweets. Next, we perform feature
engineering to create an auxiliary feature map which dramatically increases the
model accuracy. In our experiments using real data sets from Hurricanes Harvey
and Irma, it is observed that our proposed approach performs better compared to
other classification methods based on Precision, Recall, F1-score, and
Accuracy, and is highly effective to determine the correct priority of a tweet.
Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
classification model a merged dataset comprises of 4 different datasets from
CrisisNLP and another 15 different disasters data from CrisisLex are used.
Finally, we develop an adaptive multitask hybrid scheduling algorithm
considering resource constraints to perform an effective rescue scheduling
operation considering different rescue priorities.

generalizes well over combinatorial number of different classification tasks
sampled from a task distribution, have been shown to be effective for few-shot
classification tasks of unseen classes. They are often trained with episodic
training where they iteratively train a common metric space that reduces
distance between the class representatives and instances belonging to each
class, over large number of episodes with random classes. However, this
training is limited in that while the main target is the generalization to the
classification of unseen classes during training, there is no explicit
consideration of generalization during meta-training phase. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective meta-learning framework for
metricbased approaches, which we refer to as learning to generalize (L2G), that
explicitly constrains the learning on a sampled classification task to reduce
the classification error on a randomly sampled unseen classification task with
a bilevel optimization scheme. This explicit learning aimed toward
generalization allows the model to obtain a metric that separates well between
unseen classes. We validate our L2G framework on mini-ImageNet and
tiered-ImageNet datasets with two base meta-learning few-shot classification
models, Prototypical Networks and Relation Networks. The results show that L2G
significantly improves the performance of the two methods over episodic

coordination-free techniques to order operations across parallel instances,

analysis is focused on the performance of a user cluster in the typical cell,
which is significantly different from the standard stochastic geometry-based
approach of analyzing the performance of the typical user. For this setting, we
first derive the moments of the meta distributions for the CC and CE users
under NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Using this, we then derive the
distributions of the transmission rates and mean packet delays under non-real

objective of maximizing the cell sum rate (CSR) under NRT service, and the sum
effective capacity (SEC) under RT service. In addition to providing several
useful design insights, our results demonstrate that NOMA provides improved
rate region and higher CSR as compared to OMA. In addition, we also show that
NOMA provides better SEC as compared to OMA for the higher user density.

more accuracy, higher dynamic range, and fewer unused states along with simpler
hardware designs as compared to IEEE 754-2008. RISC-V, on the other hand,
provides a commercial-grade open-source ISA. It is not only elegant and simple
but also highly extensible and customizable, thereby facilitating novel
micro-architectural research and exploration. In this paper, we bring these two
technologies together and propose the first Posit Enabled RISC-V core. The
paper provides insights on how the current 'F' extension and the custom op-code
space of RISC-V can be leveraged/modified to support Posit arithmetic. We also
present implementation details of a parameterized and feature-complete Posit
FPU which is integrated with the RISC-V compliant SHAKTI C-class core either as
an execution unit or as an accelerator. To fully leverage the potential of
Posit, we further enhance our Posit FPU, with minimal overheads, to support two
different exponent sizes (with posit-size being 32-bits). This allows
applications to switch from high-accuracy computation mode to a mode with
higher dynamic-range at run-time. In the absence of viable software tool-chain

RISC-V tool-chain. We also provide examples of applications which can perform

prediction is reduced by the numerous fitting coefficients. Furthermore, the
predicted results of the established models are dependent on the size of the
photobioreactor (PBR), light intensity, flow and concentration field. The
growth mechanism of microalgae has not clearly understood in PBR cultivation.
It is difficult to predict the microalgae growth by theoretical methods, owing
to the aforementioned factors. We developed an exploratory bridging microalgae
growth model to predict the microalgae growth rate in PBRs by using the
nondimensional method which is effectively in fluid dynamics and heat transfer.
The analytical solution of the growth rate was obtained for the parallel flow.
The nondimensional growth rate expressed as function of Reynolds number and
Schmidt number, which can be used for arbitrary parallel flow due to the
solution was expressed as nondimensional quantities. The theoretically
predicted growth rate is compared with the experimentally measured microalgae
growth rate on the order of magnitude. The nondimensional method successfully
applied to the microalgae growth problem for the first time. The general
nondimensional solution can unify the numerous experimental data for different
laboratory conditions, and give a direction for the disorder of the microalgae
growth problem. The nondimensional solution may be useful to explain the growth
mechanism of microalgae and design large-scale PBRs for microalgae biofuel

context to model the evolution of the intensity of a paraxial x-ray wave field

transport-of-intensity equation. The x-ray Fokker--Planck equation can
simultaneously account for both propagation-based phase contrast, and the
diffusive effects of sample-induced small-angle x-ray scattering, when forming
an x-ray image of a thin sample. Two derivations are given for the
Fokker--Planck equation associated with x-ray imaging, together with a
Kramers--Moyal generalisation thereof. Both equations are underpinned by the
concept of unresolved speckle due to unresolved sample micro-structure. These
equations may be applied to the forward problem of modelling image formation in
the presence of both coherent and diffusive energy transport. They may also be
used to formulate associated inverse problems of retrieving the phase shifts
due to a sample placed in an x-ray beam, together with the diffusive properties
of the sample. The domain of applicability for the Fokker--Planck and
Kramers--Moyal equations for paraxial imaging is at least as broad as that of
the transport-of-intensity equation which they generalise, hence the technique
is also expected to be useful for paraxial imaging using visible light,

collaborate to collect meaningful environmental information and send them to

the energy depletion, hardware or software failure, etc. Therefore, fault
tolerance and energy efficiency are two important objectives for reliable
packet delivery. To address these objectives a novel method called fuzzy
informer homed routing protocol is introduced. The proposed method tries to
distribute the workload between every sensor node. A fuzzy logic approach is
used to handle uncertainties in cluster head communication range estimation.
The simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce
energy consumption as compared with IHR and DHR protocols. Furthermore, results
revealed that it performs better than IHR and DHR protocols in terms of first

navigating in a simulated environment and gathering visual information to

cognition, and has a close relation to many high-level meta-skills such as
generalization and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel Mental
Imagery eNhanceD (MIND) module for the embodied agent, as well as a relevant
deep reinforcement framework for training. The MIND module can not only model
the dynamics of the environment (e.g. 'what might happen if the agent passes
through a door') but also help the agent to create a better understanding of
the environment (e.g. 'The refrigerator is usually in the kitchen'). Such
knowledge makes the agent a faster and better learner in locating a feasible
policy with only a few trails. Furthermore, the MIND module can generate mental
images that are treated as short-term subgoals by our proposed deep
reinforcement framework. These mental images facilitate policy learning since
short-term subgoals are easy to achieve and reusable. This yields better
planning efficiency than other algorithms that learn a policy directly from
primitive actions. Finally, the mental images visualize the agent's intentions
in a way that human can understand, and this endows our agent's actions with
more interpretability. The experimental results and further analysis prove that
the agent with the MIND module is superior to its counterparts not only in EQA
performance but in many other aspects such as route planning, behavioral
interpretation, and the ability to generalize from a few examples.

of minimization of KL-divergence in terms of a series of low-dimensional clique

image into two disjoint subimages, and an alternating iterative optimization

an unknown multiplicative factor, or on measurements of the monomer density
fluctuation correlation length $\xi_c$. We determine $\xi_c$ from the monomer
structure factor and from the radial distribution function, and find that the
identification $\xi=\xi_c$ is not justified outside of the semidilute regime.
In order to better characterize $\xi$, we compute the pore size distribution
(PSD) following two different definitions, one by Torquato et al. (Ref.1) and
one by Gubbins et al. (Ref.2). We show that the mean values of the two
distributions, $\langle r \rangle_T$ and $\langle r \rangle_G$, both display
the behavior predicted for $\xi$ by scaling theory, and argue that $\xi$ can be

interpret the PSD as the distribution of mesh sizes, a quantity which
conventional methods cannot access. Finally, we show that it is possible to map
a polymer solution on a system of hard or overlapping spheres, for which
Torquato's PSD can be computed analytically and reproduces accurately the PSD

field of medical technology by opening new dimensions in the field of disease
detection and cure. These devices need to harness a biocompatible and
physiologically sustainable safe power source instead of relying on external
stimuli, overcoming the constraints on their applicability in-vivo. Here, by
appealing to the interplay of electromechanics and hydrodynamics in
physiologically relevant microvessels, we bring out the role of charged
Endothelial Glycocalyx layer (EGL) towards establishing a streaming potential
across physiological fluidic conduits. We account for the complex rheology of
blood-mimicking fluid by appealing to Newtonian fluid model representing the
blood plasma and a viscoelastic fluid model representing the whole blood. We
model the EGL as a poroelastic layer with volumetric charge distribution. Our
results reveal that for physiologically relevant microflows, the streaming
potential induced is typically of the order of 0.1 V/mm, which may turn out to
be substantial towards energizing biosensors and implantable medical devices
whose power requirements are typically in the range of micro to milli Watt. We
also bring out the specific implications of the relevant physiological
parameters towards establishment of the streaming potential, with a vision of
augmenting the same within plausible functional limits. We further unveil that
the dependence of streaming potential on EGL thickness might be one of the key
aspects in unlocking the mystery behind the angiogenesis pattern. Our results
may open up novel bio-sensing and actuating possibilities in medical
diagnostics as well as may provide a possible alternative regarding the
development of physiologically safe and biocompatible power sources within the

part of a developer's toolkit. However, many fundamental research questions
still remain largely unexplored. [Aim] The goal of this paper is to investigate
the highest and lowest quartile of refactoring-based data using two coupling
metrics - the Coupling between Objects metric and the more recent Conceptual
Coupling between Classes metric to answer this question. Can refactoring trends
and patterns be identified based on the level of class coupling? [Method] In
this paper, we analyze over six thousand refactoring operations drawn from
releases of three open-source systems to address one such question. [Results]
Results showed no meaningful difference in the types of refactoring applied
across either lower or upper quartile of coupling for both metrics;
refactorings usually associated with coupling removal were actually more
numerous in the lower quartile in some cases. A lack of inheritance-related
refactorings across all systems was also noted. [Conclusions] The emerging
message (and a perplexing one) is that developers seem to be largely
indifferent to classes with high coupling when it comes to refactoring types -
they treat classes with relatively low coupling in almost the same way.

to Anderson lo-calization are ubiquitous, such that all wave-functions are
exponentially localized. Moreover, no phase transition toward delocalization is
expected in 1D. This behavior is strongly modified in the presence of a bias
force. We experimentally study this case, launching a non-interacting 39 K
Bose-Einstein condensate in a 1D disordered potential induced by a
far-off-resonance laser speckle, while controlling a bias force. In agreement
with theoretical predictions, we observe a transition between algebraic
localization and delocalization as a function of our control parameter that is
the relative strength of the disorder against the bias force. We also
demonstrate that the initial velocity of the wave-packet only plays a role
through an effective disorder strength due to the correlation of the disorder.
Adding a bias force is a quite natural way to probe the transport properties of
quantum systems, a subject of broad interest that can be in particular
addressed with atomic quantum gases thanks to their high degree of control and
versatility [1]. For example, Bloch oscillations has been measured through the
addition of a constant force to atoms in periodic potential induced by an
optical lattice [2]. A force applied to a harmonic trap is equivalent to a trap
displacement. The response to such a displacement permits to reveal the fluid
or insulating behavior of atomic systems. In 1D interacting Bose gases, the
pinning transition by an optical lattice [3] or the insulating transition in
quasi-disordered optical lattice [4, 5] have been studied in this manner. More
recently, transport in quantum gases is also studied in junction-type setup
more analogous to condensed-matter systems: two reservoirs with different
chemical potentials are connected through a constriction. For example, in a gas
of fermions, the quantization of conductance through a quantum point contact
[6] and the superfluid to normal transition in a disordered thin film have been
observed [7]. In our work, we focus on the transport of non-interacting
particles in disordered media. Without a bias force, quantum interferences
between multiple paths lead to Anderson localization [8] whose signature is an
exponential decay in space of single particle wave-function [9]. This
phenomenon is ubiquitous in wave/quantum physics and it has been observed in
many physical contexts [10] including condensed-matter [11] and ultra-cold
atoms [12-14]. One-dimensional truly disordered systems are always localized
[15], contrary to the 3D case where a phase transition between localized and
extended single particle wave-functions takes place as a function of the
disorder strength [16-18]. The localization properties of 1D disordered systems
are modified in the presence of a bias force. Theoretical studies predict a
transition from algebraic localization to delocalization as a function of a
single control non-dimensional parameter $\alpha$ which is the ratio of the
force to the disorder strength [19, 20]. Physically, $\alpha$ is the relative
energy gain $\Delta$E/E of a particle of energy E when moving over a
localization length. Interestingly, in a 1D white noise disorder, this quantity
is independent of E as the localization length is proportional to E. If
$\alpha$ is small, the force does not considerably change the localization
behavior of the particle while for large $\alpha$ its dynamics is severely
affected leading to delocalization. This localization-delocalization transition
is predicted in the infinite time limit for white noise disorder [20]. In a
correlated disorder, as the one produced from a far-off-resonance laser speckle
[21], the situation is more complicated. Speckles have no Fourier component
beyond a spatial frequency 2k c. As a consequence, back-scattering and
localization are not expected in the framework of Born approximation for atoms
with wavevectors k > k c [12, 22]. Since localized wave-functions always have a
small fraction at long distance corresponding to large energies and momenta in
the presence of a bias force, we thus expect correlation-induced delocalization
at infinite time. However, signatures of the algebraic
localization-delocalization transition are predicted to be observable at
transient times [20]. In this paper, we report on the observation of the
algebraic localization-delocalization transition with cold-atoms propagating in
a one dimensional disordered potential in the presence of a controlled bias
force. We experimentally show that the non-dimensional parameter $\alpha$ is
the only relevant parameter to describe the transition. We notice that the
initial velocity of the quantum wave packet only plays a role through the
correlation of the disordered potential, showing that the transition is
in-trinsically energy independent. In the localized regime, we demonstrate an
algebraic decay of the density and measure the corresponding decay exponent as
a function of $\alpha$. At large disorder strength, a saturation of the expo

including ideal Carnot groups and in particular ideal generalized H-type Carnot
groups and the Heisenberg groups, corank $1$ Carnot groups, the Grushin plane,
and various H-type foliations, Sasakian and $3$-Sasakian manifolds. Moreover,
this constitutes the first time that a quantitative estimate independent of the
dimension is established on these spaces. For instance, the Li-Yau / Zhong-Yang
spectral-gap estimate holds on all Heisenberg groups of arbitrary dimension up
to a factor of $4$.
  We achieve this by introducing a quasi-convex relaxation of the
Lott-Sturm-Villani $\mathsf{CD}(K,N)$ condition we call the Quasi
Curvature-Dimension condition $\mathsf{QCD}(Q,K,N)$. Our motivation stems from
a recent interpolation inequality along Wasserstein geodesics in the ideal
sub-Riemannian setting due to Barilari and Rizzi. We show that on an ideal
sub-Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$, the Measure Contraction Property
$\mathsf{MCP}(K,N)$ implies $\mathsf{QCD}(Q,K,N)$ with $Q = 2^{N-n} \geq 1$,
thereby verifying the latter property on the aforementioned ideal spaces; a
result of Balogh-Krist\'aly-Sipos is used instead to handle non-ideal corank
$1$ Carnot groups. By extending the localization paradigm to completely general
interpolation inequalities, we reduce the study of various analytic and
geometric inequalities on $\mathsf{QCD}$ spaces to the one-dimensional case.
Consequently, we deduce that while (strictly) sub-Riemannian manifolds do not
satisfy any type of $\mathsf{CD}$ condition, many of them satisfy numerous
functional inequalities with \emph{exactly the same} quantitative dependence
(up to a factor of $Q$) as their $\mathsf{CD}$ counterparts.

computational resources at the network edge and let third-party Service
Providers (SPs) run on top of them, as tenants. Besides the clear advantages
for SPs and final users thanks to the vicinity of computation nodes, a NO aims
to allocate edge resources in order to increase its own utility, including
bandwidth saving, operational cost reduction, QoE for its users, etc. However,
while the number of third-party services competing for edge resources is
expected to dramatically grow, the resources deployed cannot increase
accordingly, due to physical limitations. Therefore, smart strategies are
needed to fully exploit the potential of EC, despite its constrains.
  To this aim, we propose to leverage service adaptability, a dimension that
has mainly been neglected so far: each service can adapt to the amount of
resources that the NO has allocated to it, balancing the fraction of service
computation performed at the edge and relying on remote servers, e.g., in the
Cloud, for the rest. We propose EdgeMORE, a resource allocation strategy in
which SPs express their capabilities to adapt to different resource
constraints, by declaring the different configurations under which they are
able to run, specifying the resources needed and the utility provided to the
NO. The NO then chooses the most convenient option per each SP, in order to
maximize the total utility.
  We formalize EdgeMORE as a Integer Linear Program. We show via simulation

synopsis of the key structural information of a graph. As summaries may be used
for many different purposes, there is no single concept or model of graph
summaries. We have studied existing structural graph summaries for large-scale
(semantic) graphs. Despite their different concepts and purposes, we found
commonalities in the graph structures they capture. We use these commonalities
to provide for the first time a formally defined common model, FLUID (FLexible
graph sUmmarIes for Data graphs), that allows us to flexibly define structural
graph summaries. FLUID allows graph summaries to be quickly defined, adapted,
and compared for different purposes and datasets. To this end, FLUID provides
features of structural summarization based on equivalence relations such as
distinction of types and properties, direction of edges, bisimulation, and
inference. We conduct a detailed complexity analysis of the features provided
by FLUID. We show that graph summaries defined with FLUID can be computed in
the worst case in time $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ w.r.t. $n$, the number of edges in
the data graph. An empirical analysis of large-scale web graphs with billions

increased complexity of explicit system physics-based models, the application
of data-driven approaches for fault detection and isolation has recently grown.
While detection accuracy of such approaches is generally good, their
performance on fault isolation often suffers from the fact that fault
conditions affect a large portion of the measured signals thereby masking the
fault source. To overcome this limitation and enable a more accurate fault
detection, we propose a hybrid approach combining physical performance models
with deep learning algorithms. Unobserved process variables are inferred with a
physics-based performance model to enhance the input space of a data-driven
diagnostics model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we
generate a condition monitoring dataset of an advanced gas turbine during
flight conditions under healthy and four faulty operative conditions based on
the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dynamical
model. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in combination with
two different deep learning algorithms: feed forward neural networks and
Variational Autoencoders, both of which demonstrate a significant improvement
when applied within the hybrid fault detection and diagnostics framework. The
proposed method is able to outperform pure data-driven solutions, particularly
for systems with a high variability of operating conditions. It provides
superior results both for fault detection as well as for fault isolation. For
fault isolation, it overcomes the smearing effect that is observed in pure
data-driven approaches and enables a precise isolation of the affected signal.
We also demonstrate that deep learning algorithms provide a better performance
on fault detection compared to the traditional machine learning algorithms.

robotic teams when no distance or relative displacement measurements are
available and each robot can only measure some of those angles formed by rays
towards its neighbors, we develop the notion of ``angle rigidity"" for a
multi-point framework, named ``angularity"", consisting of a set of nodes
embedded in a Euclidean space and a set of angle constraints among them.
Different from bearings or angles defined with respect to a global axis, the
angles we use do not rely on the knowledge of a global coordinate system and
are signed according to the counter-clockwise direction. Here \emph{angle
rigidity} refers to the property specifying that under proper angle
constraints, the angularity can only translate, rotate or scale as a whole when
one or more of its nodes are perturbed locally. We first demonstrate that this
angle rigidity property, in sharp comparison to bearing rigidity or other
reported rigidity related to angles of frameworks in the literature, is
\emph{not} a global property since an angle rigid angularity may allow flex
ambiguity. We then construct necessary and sufficient conditions for
\emph{infinitesimal} angle rigidity by checking the rank of an angularity's
rigidity matrix. We develop a combinatorial necessary condition for
infinitesimal minimal angle rigidity. Using the developed theories, a formation
stabilization algorithm is designed for a robotic team to achieve a globally

Science Programme of the European Space Agency (ESA) and argues that education,
communication and public engagement (hereafter EPE) should have priority in the
Voyage 2050 planning cycle. The ESA Science's Voyage 2050 missions promise
insights into the big existential questions of our era: the prevalence of life
in the Universe; the nature of space and time; and the intertwined nature of
matter, energy and gravity. It is likely that innovations in the acquisition,
handling and processing of vast data sets will drive these themes to scientific
maturity in the next decades. They offer us a timely opportunity to underline
the relevance of space sciences to everyday life and thinking. More generally,
space science is maturing to the point where it contributes to every major
aspect of our cultural discourse. Citizens need information, resources and
opportunities to actively participate in that discourse, and ESA Science can
provide these. This white paper is a modest attempt to support ESA Science
improve its engagement with society. It focuses on issues and topics to improve
ESA Science's Education and Public Engagement activities. It does not dwell on
the topics that ESA already excels at; hence this White Paper provides a
critical review of what should and could be improved. We believe ESA's Voyage
2050 programme teams have a responsibility to represent Europe's social and
cultural diversity, and our suggestions are conceived in that spirit: to
support ESA Science's complex task of engaging a hugely diverse audience in the
complex issues of planning, building and operating fascinating space missions.

structure of $\Delta v\Delta_\infty v$: for every $v\in C^\infty$, $$\ | {
|D^2vDv|^2} - {\Delta v \Delta_\infty v } -\frac12[|D^2v|^2-(\Delta
v)^2]|Dv|^2\ | \le \frac{n-2}2 [|D^2v|^2{|Dv|^2}- |D^2vDv|^2 ]. $$ Based on
this, we prove the following results:
  1. For any $p$-harmonic functions $u$, $p\in(1,2)\cup(2,\infty)$, we have
$$|Du|^{\frac{p-\gamma}2}Du\in W^{1,2}_{\rm loc},$$ with
$\gamma<\min\{p+\frac{n-1}{n},3+\frac{p-1}{n-1}\}$. As a by-product, when
$p\in(1,2)\cup(2,3+\frac2{n-2})$, we reprove the known $W^{2,q}_{\rm
loc}$-regularity of $p$-harmonic functions for some $q>2$.
  2. When $n\ge 2$ and $p\in(1,2)\cup(2,3+\frac2{n-2})$, the viscosity
solutions to parabolic normalized $p $-Laplace equation have the $W_{\rm
loc}^{2,q}$-regularity in the spatial variable and the $W_{\rm
loc}^{1,q}$-regularity in the time variable for some $q>2$. Especially, when
$n=2$ an open question in [17] is completely answered.
  3. When $n\ge 1 $ and $p\in(1,2)\cup(2,3)$, the weak/viscosity solutions to
parabolic $p $-Laplace equation have the $W_{\rm loc}^{2,2}$-regularity in the
spatial variable and the $W_{\rm loc}^{1,2}$-regularity in the time variable.
The range of $p$ (including $p=2$ from the classical result) here is sharp for
the $W_{\rm loc}^{2,2}$-regularity.

  neurons via ordinal time-series analysis",,,"10.1063/1.5121257",,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neurons encode and transmit information in spike sequences. However, despite
the effort devoted to quantify their information content, little progress has
been made in this regard. Here we use a nonlinear method of time-series
analysis (known as ordinal analysis) to compare the statistics of spike
sequences generated by applying an input signal to the neuronal model of
Morris-Lecar. In particular we consider two different regimes for the neurons
which lead to two classes of excitability: class I, where the frequency-current
curve is continuous and class II, where the frequency-current curve is
discontinuous.
  By applying ordinal analysis to sequences of inter-spike-intervals (ISIs) our
goals are (1) to investigate if different neuron types can generate spike
sequences which have similar symbolic properties;
  (2) to get deeper understanding on the effects that electrical (diffusive)
and excitatory chemical (i.e., excitatory synapse) couplings have; and (3) to
compare, when a small--amplitude periodic signal is applied to one of the
neurons, how the signal features (amplitude and frequency) are encoded and
transmitted in the generated ISI sequences for both class I and class II type
neurons and electrical or chemical couplings. We find that depending on the
frequency, specific combinations of neuron/class and coupling-type allow a more
effective encoding, or a more effective transmission of the signal.

  Recognition Systems",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can be fooled via targeted
adversarial examples, which induce the ASR to produce arbitrary transcriptions
in response to altered audio signals. However, state-of-the-art adversarial
examples typically have to be fed into the ASR system directly, and are not
successful when played in a room. The few published over-the-air adversarial
examples fall into one of three categories: they are either handcrafted
examples, they are so conspicuous that human listeners can easily recognize the
target transcription once they are alerted to its content, or they require
precise information about the room where the attack takes place, and are hence
not transferable to other rooms. In this paper, we demonstrate the first
algorithm that produces generic adversarial examples, which remain robust in an
over-the-air attack that is not adapted to the specific environment. Hence, no
prior knowledge of the room characteristics is required. Instead, we use room
impulse responses (RIRs) to compute robust adversarial examples for arbitrary
room characteristics and employ the ASR system Kaldi to demonstrate the attack.
Further, our algorithm can utilize psychoacoustic methods to hide changes of
the original audio signal below the human thresholds of hearing. In practical
experiments, we show that the adversarial examples work for varying room
setups, and that no direct line-of-sight between speaker and microphone is
necessary. As a result, an attacker can create inconspicuous adversarial
examples for any target transcription and apply these to arbitrary room setups
without any prior knowledge.

accords with normal or lognormal distribution; 2) $\Gamma_{X,1}$ and
$\Gamma_{\gamma}$ still show no correlation, but the tentative correlations of
durations, energy fluences, and isotropic energies between the gamma-ray and
X-ray phases still exist; 3) for most GRBs, there is no significant spectral
evolution between the shallow decay segment and its follow-up segment, and the
latter is usually consistent with the external-shock models; 4) assuming that
the central engine has a power-law luminosity release history as
$L(t)=L_{0}(\frac{t}{t_{0}})^{-q}$, we find that the value $q$ is mainly

the tentative correlation between $E_{\rm{iso},X}$ and $t'_{b}$ disappears, so
that the global 3-parameter correlation ($E_{\rm{iso},X}-E'_{p}-t'_{b}$)
becomes less significant; 6) the anti-correlation between $L_{X}$ and $t'_{b}$

exist with a high confidence level. Overall, our results are generally
consistent with \cite{liang07}, confirming their suggestion that the shallow

origin, probably due to a continuous energy injection from a long-lived central
engine.

$f:\Sigma_p\rightarrow\Sigma_t$ we are faced with problems found in the
well-established field of combinatorial pattern matching. If the single
character constraint is lifted and $f:\Sigma_p\rightarrow\Sigma_t^{*}$, we
obtain generalized function matching as introduced by Amir and Nor (JDA 2007).
If we further constrain $f$ to be injective, then we arrive at generalized
parametrized matching as defined by Clifford et al. (SPIRE 2009).
  There are a number of important applications for pattern matching in
computational biology, text editors and data compression, to name a few.
Therefore, many efficient algorithms have been developed for a wide variety of
specific problems including finding tandem repeats in DNA sequences, optimizing
embedded systems by reusing code etc.
  In this work we present a heuristic algorithm illustrating a practical
approach to tackling a variant of generalized function matching where
$f:\Sigma_p\rightarrow\Sigma_t^{+}$ and demonstrate its performance on
human-produced text as well as random strings.

chain length reaching a point where demixing is not possible. Most importantly,
the increase in the number of grafted chains, $N_g$, can initially favour the
phase separation of PGNPs, but further increase can lead to more difficult
demixing. The reason is the increasing impact of an effective core that forms
as the grafting density of the tethered polymer chains around the NPs
increases. The range and exact values of $N_g$ where this change in behaviour
takes place depends on the NP size and the chain length of the grafted polymer
chains. Our study elucidates the phase behaviour of PGNPs and in particular the
influence of the grafting density on the phase behaviour of the systems

the orbital relaxation time $T_{1}$ of the orbitally split ground states and
show that all optical properties are conserved during translational

we show that in a small strain regime (0-4%) dragline silk of social spiders
shows strain-softening response followed by strain-stiffening response at
higher strains (> 4%). The stress relaxation time, on the other hand, increases
monotonically with increasing strain for the entire range. We also show that
silk stiffens while ageing within the typical lifetime of a web. Our results
demand the inclusion of the kinetics of domain unfolding and refolding in the
existing models to account for the relaxation time behaviour.

Submillimeter Array (SMA) 870 micron polarization observations of
the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31 revealed one of the clearest examples up to
date of an hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology in a high-mass
star-forming region. Aims. To better establish the role that the magnetic field
plays in the collapse of G31.41+0.31, we carried out Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the polarized dust
continuum emission at 1.3 mm with an angular resolution four times higher than
that of the previous (sub)millimeter observations to achieve an unprecedented
image of the magnetic field morphology. Methods. We used ALMA to perform full
polarization observations at 233 GHz (Band 6). The resulting synthesized beam
is 0.28""x0""20 which, at the distance of the source, corresponds to a spatial
resolution of ~875 au. Results. The observations resolve the structure of the
magnetic field in G31.41+0.31 and allow us to study the field in detail. The
polarized emission in the Main core of G31.41+0.41is successfully fit with a
semi-analytical magnetostatic model of a toroid supported by magnetic fields.
The best fit model suggests that the magnetic field is well represented by a
poloidal field with a possible contribution of a toroidal component of ~10% of
the poloidal component, oriented southeast to northwest at ~ -44 deg and with
an inclination of ~-45 degr. The magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to
the northeast to southwest velocity gradient detected in this core on scales
from 1E3-1E4 au. This supports the hypothesis that the velocity gradient is due
to rotation and suggests that such a rotation has little effect on the magnetic
field. The strength of the magnetic field estimated in the central region of
the core with the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method is ~8-13 mG and implies that
the mass-to-flux ratio in this region is slightly supercritical ...

usually involving two photons, for efficient and selective transfer of
population between quantum states. A particularly interesting feature is the
fact that the coupling between the initial and the final quantum states is via
an intermediate state even though the lifetime of the latter can be much
shorter than the interaction time with the laser radiation. Nevertheless,
spontaneous emission from the intermediate state is prevented by quantum
interference. Maintaining the coherence between the initial and final state
throughout the transfer process is crucial. STIRAP was initially developed with
applications in chemical dynamics in mind. That is why the original paper of
1990 was published in The Journal of Chemical Physics. However, as of about the
year 2000, the unique capabilities of STIRAP and its robustness with respect to
small variations of some experimental parameters stimulated many researchers to
apply the scheme in a variety of other fields of physics. The successes of
these efforts are documented in this collection of articles.

types of astrophysical transients. The detection of such phenomena, whose

perform blind searches. We present a new algorithm for this purpose, based on
deep learning. We incorporate two approaches, utilising anomaly detection and
classification techniques. The first is model-independent, avoiding the use of
background modelling and instrument simulations. The second method enables
targeted searches, relying on generic spectral and temporal patterns as input.
We compare our methodology with the existing approach to serendipitous
detection of gamma-ray transients. We use our framework to derive the detection
prospects of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts with the upcoming Cherenkov
Telescope Array. Our method is an unbiased, data-driven approach for
multiwavelength and multi-messenger transient detection.

locomotion approach that allows for navigating a wide variety of terrains,

the CENTAURO system which has been designed for these requirements and consists
of the Centauro robot and a set of advanced operator interfaces with
complementary strength enabling the system to solve a wide range of realistic
mobile manipulation tasks. The robot possesses a centaur-like body plan and is
driven by torque-controlled compliant actuators. Four articulated legs ending
in steerable wheels allow for omnidirectional driving as well as for making
steps. An anthropomorphic upper body with two arms ending in five-finger hands
enables human-like manipulation. The robot perceives its environment through a
suite of multimodal sensors. The resulting platform complexity goes beyond the
complexity of most known systems which puts the focus on a suitable operator
interface. An operator can control the robot through a telepresence suit, which
allows for flexibly solving a large variety of mobile manipulation tasks.
Locomotion and manipulation functionalities on different levels of autonomy
support the operation. The proposed user interfaces enable solving a wide
variety of tasks without previous task-specific training. The integrated system
is evaluated in numerous teleoperated experiments that are described along with

in the context of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), as the detection of
primordial non-Gaussianities would form a valuable clue on the physics of the
early Universe. The virtue of both the Euler characteristic and the Minkowski
functionals in general, lies in the fact that there exist closed form
expressions for their expectation values for Gaussian random fields. However,
the Euler characteristic and Minkowski functionals are summarizing
characteristics of topology and geometry. Considerably more topological
information is contained in the homology of the random field, as it completely
describes the creation, merging and disappearance of topological features in
superlevel set filtrations.
  In the present study we extend the topological analysis of the superlevel set
filtrations of two-dimensional Gaussian random fields by analysing the
statistical properties of the Betti numbers - counting the number of connected
components and loops - and the persistence diagrams - describing the creation
and mergers of homological features. Using the link between homology and the
critical points of a function - as illustrated by the Morse-Smale complex - we
derive a one-parameter fitting formula for the expectation value of the Betti

numerically demonstrate the sensitivity of the Betti numbers and persistence

they may suggest systematic errors or the type of modifications to $\Lambda$CDM
necessary to resolve current tensions. In this work, we derive an analytic
method for calculating the level of correlations between model parameters from
two correlated cosmological data sets, which complements more computationally
expensive simulations. This method is an extension of the Fisher analysis that
assumes a Gaussian likelihood and a known data covariance matrix. We apply this
method to the SPTpol temperature and polarization CMB spectra (TE and EE). We
find weak correlations between $\Lambda$CDM parameters with a 9$\%$ correlation
between the TE-only and EE-only constraints on $H_0$ and a 25$\%$ and 32$\%$
correlation for log($A_s$) and $n_s$ respectively. Despite the negative
correlations between the TE and EE power spectra, the correlations in the
parameters are positive. The TE-EE parameter differences are consistent with
zero, with a PTE of 0.53, in contrast to the PTE of 0.017 reported by SPTpol
for the consistency of the TE and EE power spectra with $\Lambda$CDM. Using
simulations we find that the results of these two tests are independent and
that this difference can arise simply from statistical fluctuations. Ignoring
correlations in the TT-TE and TE-EE comparisons biases the $\chi^2$ low,
artificially making parameters look more consistent. Therefore, we conclude
that these correlations need to be accounted for when performing internal
consistency checks of the TT vs TE vs EE power spectra for future CMB analyses.

programme on active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the near-infrared. Spectroscopy
enables measurement of dust properties, such as flux, temperature and covering
factor, with higher precision than photometry. In particular, it enables
measurement of both luminosity-based dust radii and dust response times. Here
we report results from a one-year campaign on NGC 5548. The hot dust responds
to changes in the irradiating flux with a lag time of ~70 light-days, similar
to what was previously found in photometric reverberation campaigns. The mean
and rms spectra are similar, implying that the same dust component dominates
both the emission and the variations. The dust lag time is consistent with the
luminosity-based dust radius only if we assume a wavelength-independent dust
emissivity-law, i.e. a blackbody, which is appropriate for grains of large
sizes (of a few microns). For such grains the dust temperature is ~1450 K.
Therefore, silicate grains have most likely evaporated and carbon is the main
chemical component. But the hot dust is not close to its sublimation
temperature, contrary to popular belief. This is further supported by our
observation of temperature variations largely consistent with a heating/cooling
process. Therefore, the inner dust-free region is enlarged and the dusty torus
rather a ""dusty wall"", whose inner radius is expected to be
luminosity-invariant. The dust-destruction mechanism that enlarges the
dust-free region seems to partly affect also the dusty region. We observe a
cyclical decrease in dust mass with implied dust reformation times of ~5-6
months.

Lutwak's inequalities as the strongest among these families of inequalities,

$\Sigma_1$-subsitutions in Heyting Arithmetic, are intuitionistic propositional
formulas that does not allow nesting of implication to the left. The first
results about these formulas were obtained in a paper of 1995 by Visser et al.
In particular, it was shown that NNIL-formulas are exactly the formulas
preserved under taking submodels of Kripke models. Recently Bezhanishvili and
de Jongh observed that NNIL-formulas are also reflected by color-preserving
monotonic maps of Kripke models. In the present paper, we first show how this
observation leads to the conclusion that NNIL-formulas are preserved by
arbitrary substructures not necessarily satisfying the topo-subframe condition.
Then we apply it to construct universal models for NNIL. It follows from the
properties of these universal models that NNIL-formulas are also exactly the
formulas that are reflected by color-preserving monotonic maps. By using the
method developed in constructing the universal models, we give a new direct
proof that the logics axiomatized by NNIL-axioms have the finite model
property.

that measurements of planet-to-star radii ratio with CHEOPS can be determined

5% for an Earth-size planet orbiting a Sun-like star. It corresponds to

by the chaotic motion of electrical wavefronts in the atria. In clinical
practice, AF is classified under two primary categories: paroxysmal AF, short
intermittent episodes separated by periods of normal electrical activity, and
persistent AF, longer uninterrupted episodes of chaotic electrical activity.
However, the precise reasons why AF in a given patient is paroxysmal or
persistent is poorly understood. Recently, we have introduced the percolation
based Christensen-Manani-Peters (CMP) model of AF which naturally exhibits both
paroxysmal and persistent AF, but precisely how these differences emerge in the
model is unclear. In this paper, we dissect the CMP model to identify the cause
of these different AF classifications. Starting from a mean-field model where
we describe AF as a simple birth-death process, we add layers of complexity to
the model and show that persistent AF arises from re-entrant circuits which
exhibit an asymmetry in their probability of activation relative to
deactivation. As a result, different simulations generated at identical model
parameters can exhibit fibrillatory episodes spanning several orders of
magnitude from a few seconds to months. These findings demonstrate that
diverse, complex fibrillatory dynamics can emerge from very simple dynamics in
models of AF.

flow without the need for optical or electric fields. Active flow control
generates complex flow topologies around suspended particles during the
trapping process, yet the relationship between the control algorithm and flow
structure is not well understood. In this work, we characterize the flow
topology during active control of particle trajectories using a Stokes trap.
Our results show that optimal control of two particles unexpectedly relies on
flow patterns with zero or one stagnation points, as opposed to positioning two
particles using two distinct stagnation points. We characterize the sensitivity
of the system with respect to the parameters in the control objective function,
thereby providing a systematic understanding of the trapping process. Overall,
these results will be useful in guiding applications involving the controlled
manipulation of multiple colloidal particles and the precise deformation of
soft particles in defined flow fields.

negatively two questions by Schoutens; the first being whether there is an
axiomatization of the common theory of o-minimal structures in a given language
by conditions on one-variable definable sets alone. The second being whether
definable completeness and type completeness imply the pigeonhole principle. It
also partially answers a question by Fornasiero asking whether definable
completeness of an expansion of a real closed field implies the pigeonhole

our DTW-based approach attains the highest average classification rate reaching

extraction, is capable of reusing a classifier across different cutting
configurations, and it uses reasonably sized training sets. Although the
resulting high accuracy in our approach is associated with high computational
cost, this is specific to the DTW implementation that we used. Specifically, we
highlight available, very fast DTW implementations that can even be implemented
on small consumer electronics. Therefore, further code optimization and the
significantly reduced computational effort during the implementation phase make
our approach a viable option for in-process chatter detection.

cavities. We employ temporal coupled-mode theory to derive the optimal
conditions to achieve a high absorption efficiency in the nanowire with fine
spectral resolution. It is shown that the use of a mirror at the end of the
cascaded system that terminates the photonic crystal bus waveguide increases
the absorption efficiency up to unity, in principle, in the absence of loss.
The expected response is demonstrated by full-wave simulations for both
two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures. Absorption efficiencies of
about 80% are achieved both in two-dimensional structures for four cascaded
cavities and in three-dimensional structures for two cascaded cavities. The
achieved spectral resolution is about 1 nm. We expect that the proposed setup,
both analytically studied and numerically demonstrated in this work, offers a
great impetus for future quantum nanophotonic on-chip technologies.

time $t_{\rm stop}$ is much smaller than dynamical time of the problem. In
explicit schemes the time step $\tau$ must be less than $t_{\rm stop}$, that

tractable exact log-likelihood estimation with efficient training and synthesis
process. However, flow models suffer from the challenge of having high
dimensional latent space, the same in dimension as the input space. An
effective solution to the above challenge as proposed by Dinh et al. (2016) is
a multi-scale architecture, which is based on iterative early factorization of
a part of the total dimensions at regular intervals. Prior works on generative
flow models involving a multi-scale architecture perform the dimension
factorization based on static masking. We propose a novel multi-scale
architecture that performs data-dependent factorization to decide which
dimensions should pass through more flow layers. To facilitate the same, we
introduce a heuristic based on the contribution of each dimension to the total
log-likelihood which encodes the importance of the dimensions. Our proposed
heuristic is readily obtained as part of the flow training process, enabling
the versatile implementation of our likelihood contribution based multi-scale
architecture for generic flow models. We present such implementations for
several state-of-the-art flow models and demonstrate improvements in
log-likelihood score and sampling quality on standard image benchmarks. We also
conduct ablation studies to compare the proposed method with other options for

the provision of high quality, cost effective healthcare. Nevertheless, metrics
of performance have to date focused on the performance of individual elements
rather than the system as a whole. Manipulation of individual elements of a
complex system without an integrative understanding of its function is
undesirable and may lead to counter-intuitive outcomes and a holistic metric of
hospital function might help design more efficient services. We aimed to
characterise the system of peri-operative care for emergency surgical
admissions in our tertiary care hospital using network analysis. We used
retrospective electronic health record data to construct a weighted directional
network of the system. For this we selected all unplanned admissions during a
3.5 year period involving a surgical intervention during the inpatient stay and
obtained a set of 16,500 individual inpatient episodes. We then constructed and
analysed the structure of this network using established methods from network
science such as degree distribution, betweenness centrality and small-world
characteristics. The analysis showed the service to be a complex system with
scale-free, small-world network properties. This finding has implications for
the structure and resilience of the service as such networks, whilst being
robust in general, may be vulnerable to outages at specific key nodes. We also
identified such potential hubs and bottlenecks in the system based on a variety
of network measures. It is hoped that such a holistic, system-wide description
of a hospital service may provide better metrics for hospital strain and serve
to help planners engineer systems that are as robust as possible to external
shocks.

the difficulties involved in experimental measurements or due to the
insufficiently large simulation size. Here, we simulate energy and momentum
diffusion in the 2D nonlinear lattices using the method of fluctuation
correlation functions. Our simulations confirm that energy diffusion in the 2D
momentum-conserving lattices is anomalous and can be well described by the
L\'{e}vy-stable distribution. We also find that the disappear of side peaks of
heat mode may suggest a weak coupling between heat mode and sound mode in the
2D nonlinear system. It is also observed that the harmonic interactions in the
2D nonlinear lattices can accelerate the energy diffusion. Contrary to the
hypothesis of 1D system, we clarify that anomalous heat transport in the 2D

superdiffusion any more. Moreover, as is expected, lattices with a nonlinear

relativity (GR) have not been verified at accelerations below MOND's $a_0$. In
particular, we do not know that all the principles underlying ND or GR apply
below $a_0$. I discuss possible breakdown of general covariance (GC) in this
limit. This resonates well with MOND, which hinges on accelerations. Relaxing
GC affords more freedom in constructing MOND theories. I exemplify this with a
simplified theory whose gravitational Lagrangian is $\mathcal{L}_M\propto
\ell_M^{-2}\mathcal{F}(\ell_M^{2}\mathcal{R})$, where $\mathcal{R}= g^{\mu\nu}
(\Gamma^\gamma_{\mu\nu}\Gamma^\lambda_{\lambda\gamma}-\Gamma^\gamma_{\mu\lambda}
\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\gamma})/2$. $\Gamma^\gamma_{\mu\nu}$ is the Levi-Civita
connection of a metric, $g_{\mu\nu}$, and $\ell_M=c^2/a_0$ is the MOND length.
Requiring $\mathcal{F}(z)\rightarrow z+\zeta$, for $z\gg 1$ gives GR with a
cosmological constant $\zeta c^{-4}a_0^2$ for high accelerations. In the MOND
limit $\mathcal{F}'(z\ll 1)\propto z^{1/2}$. In the nonrelativistic limit the
metric is of the form $g_{\mu\nu}\approx \eta_{\mu\nu}-2\phi\delta_{\mu\nu}$,
as in GR, but the potential $\phi$ solves a MOND, nonlinear Poisson analog.
This form of $g_{\mu\nu}$ also produces gravitational lensing as in GR only
with the MOND potential. I show that this theory is a fixed-gauge expression of
BIMOND, with the auxiliary metric constrained to be flat. The latter theory is
thus a covariantized version of the former a-la St\""{u}ckelberg. This theory is
also a special case of so-called $f(\mathcal{Q})$ theories -- aquadratic
generalizations of `symmetric, teleparallel GR', which are, in turn, also
equivalent to constrained BIMOND-type theories. (Abridged.)

losses, of internal shocks in the outflows from classical novae, to explore the
role of shocks in powering multi-wavelength emission from radio to gamma-ray
wavelengths. Observations support a picture in which the initial phases of some
novae generate a slow, equatorially-focused outflow (directly from the outer
Lagrange point, or from a circumbinary disk), which then transitions to, or is
overtaken by, a faster more isotropic outflow from the white dwarf which
collides and shocks the slower flow, powering gamma-ray and optical emission
through reprocessing by the ejecta. However, the common occurence of multiple
peaks in nova light curves suggests that the outflow's acceleration need not be
monotonic, but instead can involve successive transitions between ""fast"" and
""slow"" modes. Such a time-fluctuating outflow velocity naturally can reproduce
several observed properties of nova, such as correlated gamma-ray and optical
flares, expansion of the photosphere coincident with (though lagging slightly)
the peak flare luminosity, and complex time-evolution of spectral lines
(including accelerating, decelerating, and merging velocity components). While
the shocks are still deeply embedded during the gamma-ray emission, the onset
of $\sim$ keV X-ray and $\sim 10$ GHz radio synchrotron emission is typically
delayed until the forward shock of the outermost monolithic shell (created by
merger of multiple internal shock-generated shells) reaches a sufficiently low
column through the dense external medium generated by the earliest phase of the
outburst.

different functionalities, at least until the current computing technology

performed through two steps: (i) separating the specific speech sources, and
(ii) determining the best output-label assignment to find the separation error.
The second step is the main obstacle in training neural networks for speech
separation. Recently proposed Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) addresses
this problem by determining the output-label assignment which minimizes the
separation error. In this study, we show that a major drawback of this
technique is the overconfident choice of the output-label assignment,
especially in the initial steps of training when the network generates
unreliable outputs. To solve this problem, we propose Probabilistic PIT
(Prob-PIT) which considers the output-label permutation as a discrete latent
random variable with a uniform prior distribution. Prob-PIT defines a
log-likelihood function based on the prior distributions and the separation
errors of all permutations; it trains the speech separation networks by
maximizing the log-likelihood function. Prob-PIT can be easily implemented by
replacing the minimum function of PIT with a soft-minimum function. We evaluate
our approach for speech separation on both TIMIT and CHiME datasets. The
results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms PIT in terms of

approaches have used this statistical viewpoint also in pore-scale transport
processes (fully resolved porous media models). When a concentration field is
transported, by advection and diffusion, in a heterogeneous media, in fact,
spatial PDFs can be defined to characterise local fluctuations and improve or
better understand the closures performed by classical upscaling methods. In the
study of hydrodynamical dispersion, for example, PDE-based PDF approach can
replace expensive and noisy Lagrangian simulations (e.g. trajectories of
drift-diffusion stochastic processes). In this work we derive a joint
position-velocity Fokker-Planck equation to model the motion of particles
undergoing advection and diffusion in in deterministic or stochastic
heterogeneous velocity fields. After appropriate closure assumptions, this
description can help deriving rigorously stochastic models for the statistics
of Lagrangian velocities. This is very important to be able to characterise the
dispersion properties and can, for example, inform velocity evolution processes
in Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) dispersion models. The closure problem
that arises when averaging the Fokker Planck equation shows also interesting

Yet, little is known about the criteria peers use in assessing grant
applications. In this systematic review we therefore identify and synthesize
studies that examine grant peer review criteria in an empirical and inductive
manner. To facilitate the synthesis, we introduce a framework that classifies
what is generally referred to as 'criterion' into an evaluated entity (i.e. the
object of evaluation) and an evaluation criterion (i.e. the dimension along
which an entity is evaluated). In total, this synthesis includes 12 studies.
Two-thirds of these studies examine criteria in the medical and health
sciences, while studies in other fields are scarce. Few studies compare
criteria across different fields, and none focus on criteria for
interdisciplinary research. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of the
12 studies and thereby identified 15 evaluation criteria and 30 evaluated
entities as well as the relations between them. Based on a network analysis, we
propose a conceptualization that groups the identified evaluation criteria and
evaluated entities into aims, means, and outcomes. We compare our results to
criteria found in studies on research quality and guidelines of funding
agencies. Since peer review is often approached from a normative perspective,
we discuss our findings in relation to two normative positions, the fairness
doctrine and the ideal of impartiality. Our findings suggest that future
studies on criteria in grant peer review should focus on the applicant, include
data from non-Western countries, and examine fields other than the medical and
health sciences.

this gap by proposing a novel one-shot face reenactment learning framework. Our
key insight is that the one-shot learner should be able to disentangle and
compose appearance and shape information for effective modeling. Specifically,
the target face appearance and the source face shape are first projected into
latent spaces with their corresponding encoders. Then these two latent spaces
are associated by learning a shared decoder that aggregates multi-level
features to produce the final reenactment results. To further improve the
synthesizing quality on mustache and hair regions, we additionally propose
FusionNet which combines the strengths of our learned decoder and the
traditional warping method. Extensive experiments show that our one-shot face
reenactment system achieves superior transfer fidelity as well as identity
preserving capability than alternatives. More remarkably, our approach trained
with only one target image per subject achieves competitive results to those
using a set of target images, demonstrating the practical merit of this work.

but the standard approach presumes ground truth for every measurement. In real
world applications, limitations due to expense or general in-feasibility due to
the specific application are common. In the context of agriculture
applications, yield monitoring is one such example where simple-physics based
measurements such as volume or force-impact have been used to quantify mass
flow, which incur error due to sensor calibration. By utilizing semi-supervised
deep learning with gradient aggregation and a sequence of images, in this work
we can accurately estimate a physical quantity (mass) with complex data
structures and sparse ground truth. Using a vision system capturing images of a
sugarcane elevator and running bamboo under controlled testing as a surrogate
material to harvesting sugarcane, mass is accurately predicted from images by
training a DNN using only final load weights. The DNN succeeds in capturing the
complex density physics of random stacking of slender rods internally as part
of the mass prediction model, and surpasses older volumetric-based methods for
mass prediction. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge about the system
physics through the DNN architecture and penalty terms, improvements in
prediction accuracy and stability, as well as faster learning are obtained. It
is shown that the classic nonlinear regression optimization can be reformulated
with an aggregation term with some independence assumptions to achieve this
feat. Since the number of images for any given run are too large to fit on
typical GPU vRAM, an implementation is shown that compensates for the limited
memory but still achieve fast training times. The same approach presented

image recognition and understanding applications. However, despite their
outstanding performance, these models are black-boxes and it is hard to
understand how they make their decisions. Over the past few years, researchers
have studied the problem of providing explanations of why DNNs predicted their
results. However, existing techniques are either obtrusive, requiring changes
in model training, or suffer from low output quality. In this paper, we present
a novel method, NeuroMask, for generating an interpretable explanation of
classification model results. When applied to image classification models,
NeuroMask identifies the image parts that are most important to classifier
results by applying a mask that hides/reveals different parts of the image,
before feeding it back into the model. The mask values are tuned by minimizing
a properly designed cost function that preserves the classification result and
encourages producing an interpretable mask. Experiments using state-of-the-art
Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition on different datasets
(CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) show that NeuroMask successfully localizes the parts of
the input image which are most relevant to the DNN decision. By showing a
visual quality comparison between NeuroMask explanations and those of other
methods, we find NeuroMask to be both accurate and interpretable.

  Neural Networks","11 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The difficulty of mountainbike downhill trails is a subjective perception.
However, sports-associations and mountainbike park operators attempt to group
trails into different levels of difficulty with scales like the
Singletrail-Skala (S0-S5) or colored scales (blue, red, black, ...) as proposed
by The International Mountain Bicycling Association. Inconsistencies in
difficulty grading occur due to the various scales, different people grading
the trails, differences in topography, and more. We propose an end-to-end deep
learning approach to classify trails into three difficulties easy, medium, and
hard by using sensor data. With mbientlab Meta Motion r0.2 sensor units, we
record accelerometer- and gyroscope data of one rider on multiple trail
segments. A 2D convolutional neural network is trained with a stacked and
concatenated representation of the aforementioned data as its input. We run
experiments with five different sample- and five different kernel sizes and
achieve a maximum Sparse Categorical Accuracy of 0.9097. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work targeting computational difficulty
classification of mountainbike downhill trails.

generally recognized: hole carriers. This includes $PbTe$ doped with $Tl$, for
which Ted has proposed that superconductivity is driven by negative-U pairing.
I will discuss why hole carriers are necessary for a material to be a
superconductor, and the implications of this for the understanding of the

the problem of diffraction by a Dirichlet half-line; 3) the problem of

obtained in terms of recursive relations (for the Green's function), algebraic
functions (for the half-line problem), or elliptic functions (for the right

premature convergence due to the loss of population diversity over generations.
To overcome this problem, several algorithms have been proposed, such as the
Graph-based Evolutionary Algorithm (GEA) \cite{1} which uses graphs to model
the structure of the population, but also memetic or differential evolution
algorithms \cite{2,3}, or diversity-based ones \cite{4,5} have been designed.
These algorithms are based on multi-populations, or often rather focus on the
self-tuning parameters, however, they become complex to tune because of their
high number of parameters. In this paper, our approach consists of an
evolutionary algorithm that allows a dynamic adaptation of the search operators
based on a graph in order to limit the loss of diversity and reduce the design
complexity.

While the
abundance of data could improve the efficiency of the system, it poses major
reliability challenges. In particular, state estimation aims to learn the
behavior of the network from data but an undetected attack on this problem
could lead to a large-scale blackout. Nevertheless, understanding vulnerability
of state estimation against cyber attacks has been hindered by the lack of
tools studying the topological and data-analytic aspects of the network.
Algorithmic robustness is of critical need to extract reliable information from
abundant but untrusted grid data. We propose a robust state estimation
framework that leverages network sparsity and data abundance. For a large-scale
power grid, we quantify, analyze, and visualize the regions of the network
prone to cyber attacks. We also propose an optimization-based graphical
boundary defense mechanism to identify the border of the geographical area
whose data has been manipulated. The proposed method does not allow a local
attack to have a global effect on the data analysis of the entire network,
which enhances the situational awareness of the grid especially in the face of
adversity. The developed mathematical framework reveals key geometric and
algebraic factors that can affect algorithmic robustness and is used to study
the vulnerability of the U.S. power grid in this paper.
