in, and interacting with, the world. Most existing methods perform 3D human
pose estimation without explicitly considering the scene. We observe however
that the world constrains the body and vice-versa. To motivate this, we show
that current 3D human pose estimation methods produce results that are not
consistent with the 3D scene. Our key contribution is to exploit static 3D
scene structure to better estimate human pose from monocular images. The method
enforces Proximal Relationships with Object eXclusion and is called PROX. To
test this, we collect a new dataset composed of 12 different 3D scenes and RGB
sequences of 20 subjects moving in and interacting with the scenes. We
represent human pose using the 3D human body model SMPL-X and extend SMPLify-X
to estimate body pose using scene constraints. We make use of the 3D scene
information by formulating two main constraints. The inter-penetration
constraint penalizes intersection between the body model and the surrounding 3D
scene. The contact constraint encourages specific parts of the body to be in
contact with scene surfaces if they are close enough in distance and
orientation. For quantitative evaluation we capture a separate dataset with 180
RGB frames in which the ground-truth body pose is estimated using a motion
capture system. We show quantitatively that introducing scene constraints
significantly reduces 3D joint error and vertex error. Our code and data are
available for research at https://prox.is.tue.mpg.de.

results on primality testing and reveal new primality testing algorithms
enabled by those results. The results have been classified (and referred to) as
lemmas/corollaries/claims whenever we have complete analytic proof(s);
otherwise the results are introduced as conjectures.
  In Part/Article 1, we start with the Baseline Primality Conjecture~(PBPC)
which enables deterministic primality detection with a low complexity = O((log
N)^2) ; when an explicit value of a Quadratic Non Residue (QNR) modulo-N is
available (which happens to be the case for an overwhelming majority = 11/12 =
91.67% of all odd integers). We then demonstrate Primality Lemma PL-1, which
reveals close connections between the state-of-the-art Miller-Rabin method and
the renowned Euler-Criterion. This Lemma, together with the Baseline Primality
Conjecture enables a synergistic fusion of Miller-Rabin iterations and our
method(s), resulting in hybrid algorithms that are substantially better than
their components. Next, we illustrate how the requirement of an explicit value
of a QNR can be circumvented by using relations of the form: Polynomial(x) mod
N = 0 ; whose solutions implicitly specify Non Residues modulo-N. We then
develop a method to derive low-degree canonical polynomials that together
guarantee implicit Non Residues modulo-N ; which along with the Generalized
Primality Conjectures enable algorithms that achieve a worst case deterministic
polynomial complexity = O( (log N)^3 polylog(log N)) ; unconditionally ; for
any/all values of N.
  In Part/Article 2 , we present substantial experimental data that corroborate
all the conjectures. No counter example has been found.
  Finally in Part/Article 3, we present analytic proof(s) of the Baseline
Primality Conjecture that we have been able to complete for some special cases.

  correlation functions",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum imaging has a potential of enhancing precision of the object
reconstruction by using quantum correlations of the imaging field. This is
especially important for imaging requiring low-intensity fields up to the level
of few-photons. However, quantum imaging generally leads to nonlinear
estimation problems. The complexity of these problems rapidly increases with
the number of parameters describing the object. We suggest a way to drastically
reduce the complexity for a wide class of problems. The key point of our
approach is connecting the features of the Fisher information with the
parametric locality of the problem, and building the efficient iterative
inference scheme reconstructing only a subset of the whole set of parameters in
each step. This iterative scheme is linear on the total number of parameters.
This scheme is applied to quantum near-field imaging, the inference procedure
is developed resulting in super-resolving reconstruction of grey compound
transmission objects. The functionality of the method is demonstrated with
experimental data obtained by measurements of higher-order correlation
functions for imaging with entangled twin-photons and pseudo-thermal light
sources. By analyzing the informational content of the measurement, it becomes
possible to predict the existence of optimal photon correlations providing for
the best image resolution in the super-resolution regime. This prediction is
experimentally confirmed. It is also shown how an estimation bias stemming from
image features may drastically improve the resolution.

investigated. Upon Li+ intercalation, LTO changes from a wide band-gap
semiconductor to a metal, causing LTO nanoparticles on metal to transition from
a super-broadband optical reflector to a solar absorber and thermal emitter.
Large tunabilities of 0.74, 0.68 and 0.30 are observed for the solar
reflectance, mid-wave infrared (MWIR) emittance and long-wave infrared (LWIR)
emittance respectively. The values exceed, or are comparable to notable
performances in the literature. A promising cycling stability is also observed.
MWIR and LWIR thermography reveal that the emittance of LTO-based electrodes
can be electrochemically tuned to conceal them amidst their environment.
Moreover, under different sky conditions, LTO shows promising solar heating and
sub-ambient radiative cooling capabilities depending on the degree of
lithiation and device design. The demonstrated capabilities of LTO make
LTO-based electrochromic devices highly promising for infrared-camouflage

is based on received data from a large number of distributed nodes which
transmit over a noisy fading MAC. The objective function is a sum of the nodes'
local loss functions. This problem has attracted a growing interest in
distributed sensing systems, and more recently in federated learning. We
develop a novel Gradient-Based Multiple Access (GBMA) algorithm to solve the
distributed learning problem over MAC. Specifically, the nodes transmit an
analog function of the local gradient using common shaping waveforms and the
network edge receives a superposition of the analog transmitted signals used
for updating the estimate. GBMA does not require power control or beamforming
to cancel the fading effect as in other algorithms, and operates directly with
noisy distorted gradients. We analyze the performance of GBMA theoretically,
and prove that it can approach the convergence rate of the centralized gradient
descent (GD) algorithm in large networks. Specifically, we establish a
finite-sample bound of the error for both convex and strongly convex loss
functions with Lipschitz gradient. Furthermore, we provide energy scaling laws

Photospheric magnetic field concentrations in network and plage areas are on
average 1.5 kG strong with inclinations of 10-20 degrees, and have <400 m/s
internal and 2-3 km/s external downflows. At the disc centre, the continuum
intensity of magnetic field concentrations in the network are on average 10%
brighter than the mean quiet Sun, whilst their plage counterparts are 3%

patches in the network have 150 G higher field strengths on average, 5% higher
continuum contrasts, and 800 m/s faster surrounding downflows than similarly
sized patches in the plage. The speed of the surrounding downflows also
correlates with the patch area, and patches containing pores can produce
supersonic flows exceeding 11 km/s in individual pixels. Furthermore, the
magnetic canopies of kG patches are on average 9 degrees more horizontal in the

novel hybrid approach for graph layout wherein crowdworkers and a simulated

High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray observatory is a great detector
of secondary particles because of its high altitude, high uptime, and large
area (including total photo-cathode area), which makes the HAWC scaler system
an ideal instrument for solar modulation studies. Although, in order to perform
these studies it is necessary to isolate and remove the atmospheric
modulations. The observed rate in each PMT has signatures of both the solar and
atmospheric modulations, which makes it difficult to measure the pressure
coefficient ($\beta_P$ ). The pressure at the HAWC site shows a periodic
behavior ($\sim$ 12 hours), which also reflects in the scalar rates. This
periodic property was used to isolate the pressure modulation and $\beta_P$
were estimated with accuracy. Since the pressure dependence is a physical
phenomenon, the estimated coefficients for PMTs should be identical, any
deviation from this can be due to malfunction of the PMT. This make this method
a useful tool to identify the malfunctioning PMTs and help us to isolate them
from the analysis. In this analysis we are presenting the method of estimation
of the pressure coefficients and its usage to correct the HAWC scalar data to

after a suitable gauge fixing. To this end we use the hidden gauge symmetries
of the 11D ambitwistor superstring, including $SO(16)$, and the description of
ambitwistor superstring as a dynamical system in an 11D superspace enlarged by
bosonic directions parametrized by 517 tensorial central charge coordinates
$Z^{\underline{\mu} \underline{\nu}}$ and
$Z^{\underline{\mu}\underline{\nu}\underline{\rho}\underline{\sigma}\underline{\kappa}}$.
  We have also found the fermionic superpartner of the polarized scattering
equation. This happens to be a differential equation in fermionic variables
imposed on the superamplitude, rather then just a condition on the scattering
data as the bosonic polarized scattering equation is.
  D=10 case is also discussed stressing the similarities and differences with
11D systems. The useful formulation of 10D ambitwistor superstring considers it
as a dynamical system in superspace enlarged with 126 tensorial central charge
coordinates $Z^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma\kappa}$.

including sleep, performance, and mood. The dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) is
the gold standard for measuring human circadian phase (i.e., timing). The
collection of DLMO is expensive and time-consuming since multiple saliva or
blood samples are required overnight in special conditions, and the samples
must then be assayed for melatonin. Recently, several computational approaches
have been designed for estimating DLMO. These methods collect daily sampled
data (e.g., sleep onset/offset times) or frequently sampled data (e.g., light
exposure/skin temperature/physical activity collected every minute) to train
learning models for estimating DLMO. One limitation of these studies is that
they only leverage one time-scale data. We propose a two-step framework for
estimating DLMO using data from both time scales. The first step summarizes
data from before the current day, while the second step combines this summary
with frequently sampled data of the current day. We evaluate three moving
average models that input sleep timing data as the first step and use recurrent
neural network models as the second step. The results using data from 207
undergraduates show that our two-step model with two time-scale features has
statistically significantly lower root-mean-square errors than models that use
either daily sampled data or frequently sampled data.

(HAWC) observatory, which is an air shower array deployed 4100 m a.s.l. in
central Mexico. The experimental site is frequently affected by strong
thunderstorms, and the detector's high altitude, large area, and high
sensitivity to cosmic-ray air showers make it ideal for investigating particle
acceleration due to the electric fields present inside the thunder storm
clouds. In particular, the scaler system of HAWC records the output of each one
of the 1200 PMTs as well as the 2, 3, and 4-fold multiplicities (logic AND in a
time window of 30 ns) of each water Cherenkov detectors (WCD) with a sampling

100 increases in the scaler rate which is in time coincidence with
thunderstorms. These events show high cross correlation between the scaler rate
and the electric field, hence can be produced by the acceleration of secondary
particle by the thunderstorm electric fields. In this work we present the
method of identification of these events and their general characteristics.

spike-layer steady state is asymptotically nonlinearly stable under appropriate

from very large to small angular scales. The observer peculiar motion with
respect to a reference frame in rest with respect to the CMB produces boosting
effects in various observable quantities, remarkable at low multipoles, and
particularly in the dipole, with frequency spectral behaviours depending on the

cardiovascular simulations in the clinical workflow. In this study, we present
uncertainty quantification in computational models of the coronary circulation
to investigate the effect of uncertain parameters, including coronary pressure
waveform, intramyocardial pressure, morphometry exponent, and the vascular wall
Young's modulus. We employ a left coronary artery model with deformable vessel
walls, simulated via an ALE framework for FSI, with a prescribed inlet pressure
and open-loop lumped parameter network outlet boundary conditions. Stochastic
modeling of the uncertain inputs is determined from intra-coronary
catheterization data or gathered from the literature. Uncertainty propagation
is performed using several approaches including Monte Carlo, Quasi MC,
stochastic collocation, and multiwavelet stochastic expansion. Variabilities in
QoI, including branch pressure, flow, wall shear stress, and wall deformation
are assessed. We find that uncertainty in inlet pressures and intramyocardial
pressures significantly affect all resulting QoIs, while uncertainty in elastic
modulus only affects the mechanical response of the vascular wall. Variability
in the morphometry exponent has little effect on coronary hemodynamics or wall
mechanics. Finally, we compare convergence behaviors of statistics of QoIs
using several uncertainty propagation methods. From the simulation results, we
conclude that the multi-wavelet stochastic expansion shows superior accuracy
and performance against Quasi Monte Carlo and stochastic collocation methods.

We consider an iDM model with small mass splitting that yields the observed

that can also explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly. We set strong limits based on the
CHARM and NuCal experiments, which come close to excluding iDM as
full-abundance thermal DM candidates in the MeV to GeV mass range, for the mass

polarization of the Si II $\lambda$6355 $\AA$ line (p$_{\rm Si II}$) as a
function of time which is seen to peak at a range of various polarization
degrees and epochs relative to maximum brightness. We reproduced the
$\Delta$m$_{15}$-p$_{\rm Si II}$ relationship identified in a previous study,
and show that subluminous and transitional objects display polarization values

found a statistically significant linear relationship between the polarization
of the Si II $\lambda$6355 $\AA$ line before maximum brightness and the Si II
line velocity and suggest that this, along with the $\Delta$m$_{15}$-p$_{\rm Si

model. In contrast, we compared our observations to numerical predictions in
the $\Delta$m$_{15}$-v$_{\rm Si II}$ plane and found a dichotomy in the
polarization properties between Chandrasekhar and sub-Chandrasekhar mass
explosions, which supports the possibility of two distinct explosion
mechanisms. A subsample of SNe display evolution of loops in the $q$-$u$ plane
that suggests a more complex Si structure with depth. This insight, which could
not be gleaned from total flux spectra, presents a new constraint on explosion
models. Finally, we compared our statistical sample of the Si II polarization
to quantitative predictions of the polarization levels for the

to the formation of giant synchrotron sources in the ICM. Studying merging
galaxy clusters in different evolutionary phases is fundamental to
understanding the origin of radio emission in the ICM. We observed the nearby

with a primary on-going merger in the E-W direction and a secondary later stage
merger with a group of galaxies in the SW, while CIZA J1824.1+3029 is
dynamically relaxed. These two clusters are in a pre-merger phase. We report
the discovery of a Mpc-scale radio halo with a low surface brightness extension
in RXC J1825.3+3026 that follows the X-ray emission from the cluster center to
the remnant of a galaxy group in the SW. This is among the least massive
systems and the faintest giant radio halo known to date. Contrary to this, no
diffuse radio emission is observed in CIZA J1824.1+3029 nor in the region

isochrone fitting to infer ages for FGKM main-sequence and subgiant field
stars. Gyrochronology and isochrone fitting are each capable of providing
relatively precise ages for field stars in certain areas of the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram: gyrochronology works optimally for cool
main-sequence stars, and isochrone fitting can provide precise ages for stars
near the main-sequence turnoff. Combined, these two age-dating techniques can
provide precise and accurate ages for a broader range of stellar masses and
evolutionary stages than either method used in isolation. We demonstrate that
the position of a star on the Hertzsprung- Russell or color-magnitude diagram
can be combined with its rotation period to infer a precise age via both
isochrone fitting and gyrochronology simultaneously. We show that incorporating
rotation periods with 5% uncertainties into stellar evolution models improves
age precision for FGK stars on the main sequence, and can, on average, provide
age estimates up to three times more precise than isochrone fitting alone. In
addition, we provide a new gyrochronology relation, calibrated to the Praesepe
cluster and the Sun, that includes a variance model to capture the rotational
behavior of stars whose rotation periods do not lengthen with the square-root
of time, and parts of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where gyrochronology has
not been calibrated. This publication is accompanied by an open source Python

stars from rotation periods, spectroscopic parameters and/or apparent

singularities of QCD are traditionally treated using parton showers or analytic
resummation. Parton showers provide a fully-differential description of an
event but are challenging to extend beyond leading logarithmic accuracy. On the
other hand, resummation calculations can achieve higher logarithmic accuracy
but often for only a single observable. Recently, there have been many
resummation calculations that jointly resum multiple logarithms. Here we
investigate the benefits and limitations of joint resummation in a case study,
focussing on the family of $e^+e^-$ event shapes called angularities. We
calculate the cross section differential in n angularities at next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy. We investigate whether reweighing a flat phase-space
generator to this resummed prediction, or the corresponding distributions from
Herwig and Pythia, leads to improved predictions for other angularities. We
find an order of magnitude improvement for n = 2 over n = 1, highlighting the
benefit of joint resummation, but diminishing returns for larger values of n.

our Universe and form a better understanding of various mechanisms that drive
galaxy formation and evolution. We argue that the proposed frequency range
would make it possible to probe important metal cooling lines such as [CII] up
to very high redshift as well as a large number of rotational lines of the CO
molecule. These can be used to trace molecular gas and dust evolution and
constrain the buildup in both the cosmic star formation rate density and the
cosmic infrared background (CIB). Moreover, surveys at the highest frequencies
will detect FIR lines which are used as diagnostics of galaxies and AGN.
Tomography of these lines over a wide redshift range will enable invaluable
measurements of the cosmic expansion history at epochs inaccessible to other
methods, competitive constraints on the parameters of the standard model of
cosmology, and numerous tests of dark matter, dark energy, modified gravity and
inflation. To reach these goals, large-scale structure must be mapped over a
wide range in frequency to trace its time evolution over a reasonable fraction
of the volume of the observable Universe. In addition, the surveyed area needs
to be very large to beat cosmic variance and to probe the largest scales where
its easier to separate the astrophysical and cosmological contributions to the
observed signal. Only, a space-borne mission can properly meet these

other known spectral distortions like $y$-type and $\mu$-type and hence are
separable from the multi-frequency CMB observation. The spectrum is close to

This can affect the gravitational wave merger rate of compact binaries in

few-body simulations, performed with a novel Monte Carlo approach. We find
that, around a SgrA*-like SMBH, three-body encounters increase the number of
mergers by a factor of 3. This occurs because close encounters can reorient
binaries with respect to their orbital plane around the SMBH, increasing the
number of Kozai-Lidov induced mergers. We obtain a binary black hole merger

a much larger scatter is observed, with a considerable (15-20\%) fraction of
the outliers being [CII]-deficient. Moreover, the [CII] surface brightness
($\Sigma_{\rm CII}$) of these sources is systematically lower than expected
from the local relation. To clarify the origin of such [CII]-deficiency we have
developed an analytical model that fits local [CII] data, and has been
validated against radiative transfer simulations performed with CLOUDY. The
model predicts an overall increase of $\Sigma_{\rm CII}$ with the surface star
formation rate ($\Sigma_*$). However, for $\Sigma_* > 1 M_\odot~{\rm

underluminous [CII] systems can result from a combination of three factors: (a)
large upward deviations from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation ($\kappa_s \gg 1$),
parameterized by the ""burstiness"" parameter $\kappa_s$; (b) low metallicity;
(c) low gas density, at least for the most extreme sources (e.g. CR7).
Observations of [CII] emission alone cannot break the degeneracy among the
above three parameters; this requires additional information coming from other
emission lines (e.g. [OIII]88$\mu$m, CIII]1909A, CO lines). Simple formulae are

two principal differences: 1) galaxies can have close flybys without ending in
mergers in MOND because of weaker dynamical friction, and 2) tidal dwarf
galaxies form very easily in MOND. When this is combined with the fact that
many interacting galaxies are observed at high redshift, we obtain a new
perspective on tidal features: they are often formed by non-merging encounters
and tidal disruptions of tidal dwarf galaxies. Here we present the results from
our self-consistent MOND $N$-body simulation of a close flyby of two galaxies
similar to the Milky Way. It turns out that most types of the structures that
are traditionally assigned to galaxy mergers can be formed by non-merging
encounters, including tidal arms, bridges, streams, shells, disk warps, thick
disks, and most probably also disks of satellites. The success of MOND in
explaining the dynamics of galaxies hints us that this way of formation of

$ugrizYJK_{\mathrm{s}}$ broadband imaging. We adopt the LePhare
$\chi^{2}$-minimisation SED-fitting routine and various samples of galaxies
and/or quasi-stellar objects to investigate the intrinsic reddening. We find
that only when we construct reddening maps using objects classified as galaxies
with low levels of intrinsic reddening (i.e. ellipticals/lenticulars and
early-type spirals), the resultant maps are consistent with previous literature
determinations i.e. the intrinsic reddening of the SMC bar is higher than that
in the outer environs. We employ two sets of galaxy templates - one theoretical
and one empirical - to test for template dependencies in the resulting
reddening maps and find that the theoretical templates imply systematically
higher reddening values by up to 0.20 mag in $E(B-V)$. A comparison with
previous reddening maps, based on the stellar components of the SMC, typically
shows reasonable agreement. There is, however, significant variation amongst
the literature reddening maps as to the level of intrinsic reddening associated
with the bar. Thus, it is difficult to unambiguously state that instances of
significant discrepancies are the result of appreciable levels of dust not
accounted for in some literature reddening maps or whether they reflect issues

the KISS galaxies: one which probes the properties of the entire sample as a
function of local density, and a second which details the properties of 33 KISS
star-forming galaxies located within the Bootes Void. In both cases we find no
evidence that either the metallicity of the KISS galaxies or their SFRs depend

does show weak trends for decreasing stellar mass, decreasing metallicity, and
decreasing SFRs with decreasing local densities. However, we argue that the
metallicity and SFR trends are artifacts of the stellar mass - local density
trend. In particular, the change in metallicity with density is precisely what
one would predict from the mass-metallicity relation given the observed drop in
stellar mass with decreasing metallicity. Likewise, the SFR trend with density
disappears when one instead considers the mass-normalized specific SFR. The

us to maintain domain knowledge and systematics control while using all the
advantages of ML. Using simulated light curves that match the noise properties

regularizations of the Hamiltonian constraint in loop quantum cosmology: the
standard and the Thiemann regularization. We show that novel features of
singularity resolution and bounce, occurring due to gauge-covariant fluxes,

unviable as in standard loop quantum cosmology when a positive cosmological

nature of emergent matter in the pre-bounce regime is determined by the choice
of regulator in the Thiemann regularization of the scalar constraint whether or
not one uses gauge-covaraint fluxes. Unlike $\bar \mu$-scheme where the

dependency contains dependencies between all packages required to build and run
the target software. Package management system developers, package maintainers,
and users may consult the dependency graph when a simple listing is
insufficient for their analyses. However, users working in a remote command
line environment must disrupt their workflow to visualize dependency graphs in
graphical programs, possibly needing to move files between devices or incur
forwarding lag. Such is the case for users of Spack, an open source package
management system originally developed to ease the complex builds required by
supercomputing environments. To preserve the command line workflow of Spack, we
develop an interactive ASCII visualization for its dependency graphs. Through
interviews with Spack maintainers, we identify user goals and corresponding
visual tasks for dependency graphs. We evaluate the use of our visualization
through a command line-centered study, comparing it to the system's two
existing approaches. We observe that despite the limitations of the ASCII
representation, our visualization is preferred by participants when approached
from a command line interface workflow.

determine whether these objects have any distinctive properties, potentially
setting them aside from lower-luminosity obscured AGN in the local Universe.
Our analysis relies on the first data release of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic
Survey (BASS/DR1) and on dedicated observations with the VLT, Palomar, and Keck
observatories. We find that the vast majority of our sources agree with
commonly used AGN selection criteria which are based on emission line ratios
and on mid-infrared colours. Our AGN are predominantly hosted in massive
galaxies (9.8 < log(M_*/M_sun) < 11.7); based on visual inspection of archival
optical images, they appear to be mostly ellipticals. Otherwise, they do not
have distinctive properties. Their radio luminosities, determined from publicly
available survey data, show a large spread of almost 4 orders of magnitude -
much broader than what is found for lower X-ray luminosity obscured AGN in
BASS. Moreover, our sample shows no preferred combination of black hole masses
(M_BH) and/or Eddington ratio (lambda_Edd), covering 7.5 < log(M_BH/M_sun) <
10.3 and 0.01 < lambda_Edd < 1. Based on the distribution of our sources in the
lambda_Edd-N_H plane, we conclude that our sample is consistent with a scenario
where the amount of obscuring material along the line of sight is determined by
radiation pressure exerted by the AGN on the dusty circumnuclear gas.

constrain the galaxy-halo connection using satellite kinematics. Unlike
traditional methods, Basilisk does not resort to stacking the kinematics of
satellite galaxies in bins of central luminosity, and does not make use of
summary statistics, such as satellite velocity dispersion. Rather, Basilisk
leaves the data in its raw form and computes the corresponding likelihood. In
addition, Basilisk can be applied to flux-limited, rather than volume-limited
samples, greatly enhancing the quantity and dynamic range of the data. And
finally, Basilisk is the only available method that simultaneously solves for
halo mass and orbital anisotropy of the satellite galaxies, while properly
accounting for scatter in the galaxy-halo connection. Basilisk uses the
conditional luminosity function to model halo occupation statistics, and
assumes that satellite galaxies are a relaxed tracer population of the host
halo's potential with kinematics that obey the spherical Jeans equation. We
test and validate Basilisk using mocks of varying complexity, and demonstrate
that it yields unbiased constraints on the galaxy-halo connection and at a
precision that rivals galaxy-galaxy lensing. In particular, Basilisk accurately
recovers the full PDF of the relation between halo mass and central galaxy
luminosity, and simultaneously constrains the orbital anisotropy of the
satellite galaxies. Basilisk's inference is not affected by potential velocity
bias of the central galaxies, or by slight errors in the inferred, radial
profile of satellite galaxies that arise as a consequence of interlopers and
sample impurity.

The escape fraction increases as H II regions evolve and reaches unity within a
few dynamical times. The cumulative escape fraction before the onset of the
first supernova explosion is in the range 0.05-0.58; this is lower for higher
initial cloud surface density, and higher for less massive and more compact
clouds due to rapid destruction. Once H II regions break out of their local
environment, both ionizing and non-ionizing photons escape from clouds through
fully ionized, low-density sightlines. Consequently, dust becomes the dominant
absorber of ionizing radiation at late times and the escape fraction of
non-ionizing radiation is only slightly larger than that of ionizing radiation.
The escape fraction is determined primarily by the mean $\langle \tau\rangle$
and width $\sigma$ of the optical-depth distribution in the large-scale cloud,
increasing for smaller $\langle \tau\rangle$ and/or larger $\sigma$. The escape
fraction exceeds (sometimes by three orders of magnitude) the naive estimate
$e^{-\langle \tau\rangle}$ due to non-zero $\sigma$ induced by turbulence. We
present two simple methods to estimate, within $\sim20\%$, the escape fraction

added to the detector, which will improve the ability of the detector to
identify neutrons. A core-collapse supernova will be preceded by an increasing
flux of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, from thermal and weak nuclear processes
in the star, over a timescale of hours; some of which may be detected at SK-Gd.
This could provide an early warning of an imminent core-collapse supernova,
hours earlier than the detection of the neutrinos from core collapse. Electron
anti-neutrino detection will rely on inverse beta decay events below the usual
analysis energy threshold of SK, so Gd loading is vital to reduce backgrounds
while maximising detection efficiency. Assuming normal neutrino mass ordering,
more than 200 events could be detected in the final 12 hours before core
collapse for a 15-25 solar mass star at around 200 pc, which is representative
of the nearest red supergiant to Earth, $\mathrm{\alpha}$Ori (Betelgeuse). At a

scalar coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant is constrained to satisfy a
differential equation, the gravitational wave speed becomes equal to one.
Accordingly, we investigate the inflationary phenomenology of the resulting
restricted Einstein Gauss-Bonnet model, by assuming that the slow-roll
conditions hold true. As we demonstrate, the compatibility with the
observational data coming from the Planck 2018 collaboration, can be achieved,
even for a power-law potential. We restricted ourselves to the study of the
power-law potential, due to the lack of analyticity, however more realistic
potentials can be used, in this case though the calculations are not easy to be
performed analytically. We also pointed out that a string-corrected extension
of the Einstein Gauss-Bonnet model we studied, containing terms of the form
$\sim \xi(\phi) G^{ab}\partial_a\phi \partial_b \phi $ can also provide a
theory with gravity waves speed $c_T^2=1$ in natural units, if the function
$\xi(\phi)$ is appropriately constrained, however in the absence of the
Gauss-Bonnet term $\sim \xi(\phi) \mathcal{G}$ the gravity waves speed can
never be $c_T^2=1$. Finally, we discuss which extensions of the above models
can provide interesting cosmologies, since any combination of $f(R,X,\phi)$
gravities with the above string-corrected Einstein Gauss-Bonnet models can
yield $c_T^2=1$, with $X=\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi $.

the reduction of cycle-to-cycle variations in spark ignition engines, there is
still a need for a better fundamental understanding of the governing
in-cylinder phenomena in order to enable resilient early flame growth. To
isolate the effects of small- and large-scale turbulent flow motion on the
young flame kernel, a three-dimensional DNS database has been designed to be
representative for engine part load conditions. The analysis is focussed on
flame displacement speed and flame area in order to investigate effects of
flame structure and flame geometry on the global burning rate evolution. It is
shown that despite a Karlovitz number of up to 13, which is at the upper range
of conventional engine operation, thickening of the averaged flame structure by
small-scale turbulent mixing is not observed. After ignition effects have
decayed, the flame normal displacement speed recovers the behavior of a laminar
unstretched premixed flame under the considered unity-Lewis-number conditions.
Run-to-run variations in the global heat release rate are shown to be primarily
caused by flame kernel area dynamics. The analysis of the flame area balance
equation shows that turbulence causes stochastic flame kernel area growth by
affecting the curvature evolution, rather than by inducing variations in total
flame area production by strain. Further, it is shown that in local segments of
a fully-developed planar flame with similar surface area as the investigated
flame kernels, temporal variations in flame area rate-of-change occur.
Contrasting to early flame kernels, these effects can be exclusively attributed
to curvature variations in negatively curved flame regions.

planets accreting around a star, or satellites around a planet. We find that
when the loop-back orbit remains inside roughly 1/3 of the Hill radius from the

orbit increases in radius, the return velocity and angle of the second

graphs from similar domains as the target poisoned graph are usually available
in the real world. By perturbing these clean graphs, we create supervised
knowledge to train the ability to detect adversarial edges so that the
robustness of GNNs is elevated. However, such potential for clean graphs is
neglected by existing work. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of
improving the robustness of GNNs against poisoning attacks by exploring clean
graphs. Specifically, we propose PA-GNN, which relies on a penalized
aggregation mechanism that directly restrict the negative impact of adversarial
edges by assigning them lower attention coefficients. To optimize PA-GNN for a
poisoned graph, we design a meta-optimization algorithm that trains PA-GNN to
penalize perturbations using clean graphs and their adversarial counterparts,
and transfers such ability to improve the robustness of PA-GNN on the poisoned
graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of PA-GNN against poisoning attacks on graphs. Code and data are
available here: https://github.com/tangxianfeng/PA-GNN.

scalability of blockchain. By composing multiple parallel chain instances, the
whole systems' throughput can approach the network capacity. How to coordinate
different chains' blocks and to construct them into a global ordering is
critical to the performance of parallel chain protocol. However, the existed
solutions use either the global synchronization clock with the single-chain
bottleneck or pre-defined ordering sequences with distortion of blocks'
causality to order blocks. In addition, the prior ordering methods rely on that
honest participants faithfully follow the ordering protocol, but remain silent
for any denial of ordering (DoR) attack.
  On the other hand, the conflicting transactions included into the global
block sequence will make Simple Payment Verification (SPV) difficult. Clients
usually need to store a full record of transactions to distinguish the
conflictions and tell whether transactions are confirmed. However, the
requirement for a full record will greatly hinder blockchains' application,
especially for mobile scenarios.
  In this technical report, we propose Eunomia, which leverages logical clock
and fine-grained UTXO sharding to realize a simple, efficient, secure and
permissionless parallel chain protocol. By observing the characteristics of the
parallel chain, we find the blocks ordering issue in parallel chain has many
similarities with the event ordering in the distributed system. Eunomia thus
adopts ""virtual"" logical clock, which is optimized to have the minimum protocol
overhead and runs in a distributed way. In addition, Eunomia combines the
mining incentive with block ordering, providing incentive compatibility against
DoR attack. What's more, the fine-grained UTXO sharding does well solve the
conflicting transactions in parallel chain and is shown to be SPV-friendly.

optimizes the design performance with a yield guarantee, and it consists of two

objectives and chance constraints with a few simulation samples, and a novel
yield optimization module that handles probabilistic objectives and chance
constraints in an efficient deterministic way. This deterministic treatment
avoids repeatedly evaluating probability measures at each iteration, thus it
only requires a few simulations in the whole optimization flow. We validate the
accuracy and efficiency of the whole framework by a synthetic example and two
photonic ICs. Our optimization method can achieve more than $30\times$

the research object, and the data, 950,302 papers published between 1998 and

citations than those without, and the citation advantage of these
internationalized work holds when we control for characteristics of the citing

largely as an artifact of the increased number of papers citing foreign

the reconstruction of the secret in secret sharing as a game. It was shown that
participants (parties) may refuse to reveal their shares and so the
reconstruction may fail. Moreover, a refusal to reveal the share may be a
dominant strategy of a party.
  In this paper we consider secret sharing as a sub-action or subgame of a
larger action/game where the secret opens a possibility of consumption of a
certain common good. We claim that utilities of participants will be dependent
on the nature of this common good. In particular, Halpern and Teague scenario
corresponds to a rivalrous and excludable common good. We consider the case
when this common good is non-rivalrous and non-excludable and find many natural
Nash equilibria. We list several applications of secret sharing to demonstrate
our claim and give corresponding scenarios. In such circumstances the secret
sharing scheme facilitates a power sharing agreement in the society. We also
state that non-reconstruction may be beneficial for this society and give
several examples.

(mmWave) frequencies. In particular, a dual-beam mmWave transmitter, comprised
of two independent antenna arrays, attempts to reliably communicate to a
receiver Bob when hiding the existence of transmission from a warden Willie. In
this regard, operating over mmWave bands not only increases the covertness
thanks to directional beams, but also increases the transmission data rates
given much more available bandwidths and enables ultra-low form factor
transceivers due to the lower wavelengths used compared to the conventional
radio frequency (RF) counterpart. We assume that the transmitter Alice employs
one of its antenna arrays to form a directive beam for transmission to Bob. The
other antenna array is used by Alice to generate another beam toward Willie as
a jamming signal with its transmit power changing independently from a
transmission block to another block. We characterize Willie's detection
performance with the optimal detector and the closed-form of its expected value
from Alice's perspective. We further derive the closed-form expression for the
outage probability of the Alice-Bob link, which enables characterizing the
optimal covert rate that can be achieved using the proposed setup. Our results

information underlying previous queries and sessions. Intuitively, the order of
issued queries is important in inferring the real user interests. And more
recent sessions should provide more reliable personal signals than older
sessions. In addition, the previous search history and user behaviors should
influence the personalization of the current query depending on their
relatedness. To implement these intuitions, in this paper we employ a
hierarchical recurrent neural network to exploit such sequential information
and automatically generate user profile from historical data. We propose a
query-aware attention model to generate a dynamic user profile based on the

from a commercial search engine when compared with several traditional

to attribute higher weights to more related past sessions after fine training.

are challenging, especially for high speed flows (Smits et al., 2011). Many

detectable consequences, and is believed to drive anomalous transport effects

effects of a dynamical magnetic field on the hydrodynamic medium created in the
collisions of two ultrarelativistic heavy-ions, using the framework of
numerical ideal MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) with the ECHO-QGP code. In this
study, we consider a magnetic field captured in a conducting medium, where the
conductivity can receive contributions from the electromagnetic conductivity
$\sigma$ and the chiral magnetic conductivity $\sigma_{\chi}$. We first study
the elliptic flow of pions, which we show is relatively unchanged by the
introduction of a magnetic field. However, by increasing the magnitude of the
magnetic field, we find evidence for an enhancement of the elliptic flow in
peripheral collisions. Next, we explore the impact of the chiral magnetic
conductivity on electric charges produced at the edges of the fireball. This
initial $\sigma_\chi$ can be understood as a long-wavelength effective
description of chiral fermion production. We then demonstrate that this chiral
charge, when transported by the MHD medium, produces a charge dipole
perpendicular to the reaction plane which extends a few units in rapidity.
Assuming charge conservation at the freeze-out surface, we show that the
produced charge imbalance can have measurable effects on some experimental
observables, like $v_1$ or $\langle \sin \phi \rangle$. This demonstrates the
ability of a MHD fluid to transport the signature of the initial chiral
magnetic fields to late times.

velocity decreases in a series of steps that correspond to the immobilization

macroscopic world, such as when tuning a musical instrument, as well as at the

isolated nanoelectromechanical resonators (NEMS) has enabled innovations such
as tunable mechanical filtering and mixing as well as commercial technologies
such as robust timing oscillators. Much like their electronic device
counterparts, the potential of NEMS grows when they are built up into
large-scale arrays. Such arrays have enabled neutral-particle mass spectroscopy
and have been proposed for ultralow-power alternatives to traditional analog
electronics as well as nanomechanical information technologies like memory,
logic, and computing. A fundamental challenge to these applications is to
precisely tune the vibrational frequency and coupling of all resonators in the
array, since traditional tuning methods, like patterned electrostatic gating or
dielectric tuning, become intractable when devices are densely packed. Here, we
demonstrate a persistent, rewritable, scalable, and high-speed frequency tuning
method for graphene-based NEMS. Our method uses a focused laser and two shared
electrical contacts to photodope individual resonators by simultaneously
applying optical and electrostatic fields. After the fields are removed, the
trapped charge created by this process persists and applies a local
electrostatic tension to the resonators, tuning their frequencies. By providing
a facile means to locally address the strain of a NEMS resonator, this approach
lays the groundwork for fully programmable large-scale NEMS lattices and
networks.

always be necessary as long as the images enable the means of extracting the
clinically relevant measures. In this paper, we work on jointly predicting
cardiac motion estimation and segmentation directly from undersampled data,
which are two important steps in quantitatively assessing cardiac function and
diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. In particular, a unified model consisting
of both motion estimation branch and segmentation branch is learned by
optimising the two tasks simultaneously. Additional corresponding fully-sampled
images are incorporated into the network as a parallel sub-network to enhance
and guide the learning during the training process. Experimental results using
cardiac MR images from 220 subjects show that the proposed model is robust to
undersampled data and is capable of predicting results that are close to that
from fully-sampled ones, while bypassing the usual image reconstruction stage.

Similar stabilization and enhanced intensity also occurs for shorter-lived

that the increase of the spin polarization is due to the scattering of the

marginal probability of identification risk for a record, which is composed as
the probability that the identity of the record may be disclosed. Our

provides an overall improved privacy protection; however, the identification
risks actually increase for some moderate-risk records after risk-adjusted

weighting; a phenomenon we label ""whack-a-mole"". We proceed to construct a
weight for each record from a collection of pairwise identification risk
probabilities with other records, where each pairwise probability measures the
joint probability of re-identification of the pair of records, which mitigates
the whack-a-mole issue and produces a more efficient set of synthetic data with

Thanks to the advent of monolithically fabricated transition edge sensor (TES)
arrays, the number of on-sky detectors has been increasing exponentially for
over a decade. The next-generation experiment CMB-S4 will increase this
detector count by more than an order of magnitude from the current
state-of-the-art to ~500,000. The readout of such a huge number of exquisitely
precise sub-Kelvin sensors is feasible using an existing technology:
frequency-domain multiplexing (fMux). To further optimize this system and
reduce complexity and cost, we have recently made significant advances
including the elimination of 4 K electronics, a massive decrease of parasitic
in-series impedances, and a significant increase in multiplexing factor.

probability distribution is a major challenge in modern image analytics yet
trivial task for the human visual system (HVS). Discrepancies in probability
distributions, also known as \emph{drifts}, can occur due to various reasons
including, but not limited to differences in sequences and modalities (e.g.,
MRI T1-T2 and MRI-CT registration), or acquisition settings (e.g., multisite,
inter-subject, or intra-subject registrations). The popular assumption about
the working of HVS is that it exploits a communal feature subspace exists
between the registering images or fields-of-view that encompasses key
drift-invariant features. Mimicking the approach that is potentially adopted by
the HVS, herein, we present a representation learning technique of this
invariant communal subspace that is shared by registering domains. The proposed
communal domain learning (CDL) framework uses a set of hierarchical nonlinear
transforms to learn the communal subspace that minimizes the probability
differences and maximizes the amount of shared information between the
registering domains. Similarity metric and parameter optimization calculations
for registration are subsequently performed in the drift-minimized learned
communal subspace. This generic registration framework is applied to register
multisequence (MR: T1, T2) and multimodal (MR, CT) images. Results demonstrated
generic applicability, consistent performance, and statistically significant
improvement for both multi-sequence and multi-modal data using the proposed

We also show $P_\Gamma$ is of homological finiteness type $F_{m-1}$, but not
$F_m$, where $m$ is the number of copies of $K_3$ in $\Gamma$, except in
trivial cases. The embedding result is extended to graphs whose 4-cliques share
at most one edge, giving an injection of $P_\Gamma$ into the product of pure
braid groups corresponding to maximal cliques of $\Gamma$. We give examples
showing that this map may inject in more general circumstances. We define the
graphic braid group $B_\Gamma$ as a natural extension of $P_\Gamma$ by the
automorphism group of $\Gamma$, and extend our homological finiteness result to
these groups.

modeled through the universal entangling cloner scheme, which is based on the
premise that the whole environment is under control of the adversary, i.e., the
eavesdropper purifies the system. This assumption implies that the eavesdropper
has either access to an identity (noiseless) channel or infinite amount of
entanglement in order to simulate such an identity channel. In this work, we
challenge the necessity of this assumption, and we propose a
teleportation-based eavesdropping attack, where the eavesdropper is not assumed
to have access to the shared channel, that represents the unavoidable noise due
to the environment. Under collective measurements, this attack reaches
optimality in the limit of infinite amount of entanglement, while for finite
entanglement resources it outperforms the corresponding optimal individual
attack. We also calculate the minimum amount of distributed entanglement that
is necessary for this eavesdropping scheme, since we consider it as the
operationally critical quantity capturing the limitations of a realistic
attack. We conclude that the fact that infinite amount of entanglement is
required for an optimal collective eavesdropping attack signifies the
robustness of Gaussian quantum key distribution.

specifically, a pseudo label generator is proposed to leverage seed information

dynamically searched feature centroids for same class among different datasets
are aligned by accumulating previously-learned features. Meanwhile, adversarial

giant stars by applying the spectrum-fitting technique to the 12CN and 13CN
lines in the ~8002-8005A region, with an aim to investigate how these

already reported in our previous work. It was confirmed that [N/Fe] values are
generally supersolar (typically by several tenths dex though widely differ from
star to star), anti-correlated with [C/Fe], and correlated with [Na/Fe], as
expected from theory. As seen from their dependence upon stellar parameters, it
appears that mixing tends to be enhanced with an increase of stellar luminosity
(or mass) and rotational velocity, which is also reasonable from the
theoretical viewpoint. In contrast, the resulting 12C/13C ratios turned out to
be considerably diversified in the range of ~5-50 (with a peak around ~20),
without showing any systematic dependence upon C or N abundance anomalies
caused by the mixing of CN-cycled material. It thus appears that our

depends on the direction of alpha-proton differential flow Vd. As Vd rotates
from anti-Sunward direction to Sunward direction, the occurrence rate of ECWs
as well as the percentage of left-handed (LH) polarized ECWs decreases
considerably. In particular, it is shown that the dominant polarization changes
from LH polarization to right-handed polarization during the rotation. The

thermography, that can remotely measure the temperature distribution beneath

thermal-emission spectrum in the semitransparent spectral region of the target
object to extract its temperature as a function of depth, in contrast with
conventional thermography, which uses the spectrally integrated thermally
emitted power to measure the surface temperature. Coupled with two-dimensional
imaging, e.g., using an infrared hyperspectral camera or scanning a
single-pixel spectrometer, this technique can yield volumetric temperature
distributions. We carried out a proof-of-concept experiment on an
asymmetrically heated fused-silica window, extracting the temperature
distribution throughout the sample. Depth thermography may enable noncontact
volumetric temperature measurements of microscopic objects such as multilayer
electronic devices or macroscopic volumes of liquids and gasses as well as
simultaneous all-optical measurements of optical and thermal properties.

infinite-horizon optimal control is to derive the stabilization condition with
the optimal LQ controller. This paper focuses on the stabilization of an Ito
stochastic system with indefinite control and state weighting matrices in the
cost functional. A generalized algebraic Riccati equation (GARE) is obtained
via the convergence of the generalized differential Riccati equation (GDRE) in
the finite-horizon case. More importantly, the necessary and sufficient
stabilization conditions for indefinite stochastic control are obtained. One of
the key techniques is that the solution of the GARE is decomposed into a
positive semi-definite matrix that satisfies the singular algebraic Riccati
equation (SARE) and a constant matrix that is an element of the set satisfying
certain linear matrix inequality conditions. Using the equivalence between the
GARE and SARE, we reduce the stabilization of the general indefinite case to
that of the definite case, in which the stabilization is studied using a
Lyapunov functional defined by the optimal cost functional subject to the SARE.

5548 discovered an anomalous period, the broad-line region (BLR) holiday, in
which the emission lines decorrelated from the continuum variations. This is
important since the correlation between the continuum-flux variations and the
emission-line response is the basic assumption for black hole (BH) mass
determinations through reverberation mapping. During the BLR holiday, the
high-ionization intrinsic absorption lines also decorrelated from the continuum
as a result of variable covering factor of the line of sight (LOS) obscurer.
The emission lines are not confined to the LOS, so this does not explain the
BLR holiday. If the LOS obscurer is a disk wind, its streamlines must extend
down to the plane of the disk and the base of the wind would lie between the BH
and the BLR, forming an equatorial obscurer. This obscurer can be transparent
to ionizing radiation, or can be translucent, blocking only parts of the SED,
depending on its density. An emission-line holiday is produced if the wind
density increases only slightly above its transparent state. Both obscurers are
parts of the same wind, so they can have associated behavior in a way that
explains both holidays. A very dense wind would block nearly all ionizing
radiation, producing a Seyfert 2 and possibly providing a contributor to the
changing-look AGN phenomenon. Disk winds are very common and we propose that
the equatorial obscurers are too, but mostly in a transparent state.

deep learning for lung segmentation using chest x-ray (CXR) images with small-
or medium-sized abnormal findings. Here, we built a database including both CXR
images with severe abnormalities and experts' lung segmentation results, and
aimed to evaluate our network's efficacy in lung segmentation from these
images. Materials and Methods: For lung segmentation, CXR images from the
Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT, N = 247) and Montgomery
databases (N = 138), were included, and 65 additional images depicting severe
abnormalities from a public database were evaluated and annotated by a
radiologist, thereby adding lung segmentation results to these images. Baseline
U-net was used to segment the lungs in images from the three databases.
Subsequently, the U-net network architecture was automatically optimized for
lung segmentation from CXR images using Bayesian optimization. Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) was calculated to confirm segmentation. Results: Our results
demonstrated that using baseline U-net yielded poorer lung segmentation results
in our database than those in the JSRT and Montgomery databases, implying that
robust segmentation of lungs may be difficult because of severe abnormalities.

were 0.979, 0.941, and 0.889, respectively, and with optimized U-net, 0.976,
0.973, and 0.932, respectively. Conclusion: For robust lung segmentation, the

demonstrate that the optimized U-net was more robust than baseline U-net in
lung segmentation from CXR images with large-sized abnormalities.

  Tracking","12 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dialogue state tracking (DST) is an essential component in task-oriented
dialogue systems, which estimates user goals at every dialogue turn. However,
most previous approaches usually suffer from the following problems. Many
discriminative models, especially end-to-end (E2E) models, are difficult to
extract unknown values that are not in the candidate ontology; previous
generative models, which can extract unknown values from utterances, degrade
the performance due to ignoring the semantic information of pre-defined
ontology. Besides, previous generative models usually need a hand-crafted list
to normalize the generated values. How to integrate the semantic information of
pre-defined ontology and dialogue text (heterogeneous texts) to generate
unknown values and improve performance becomes a severe challenge. In this
paper, we propose a Copy-Enhanced Heterogeneous Information Learning model with
multiple encoder-decoder for DST (CEDST), which can effectively generate all
possible values including unknown values by copying values from heterogeneous
texts. Meanwhile, CEDST can effectively decompose the large state space into
several small state spaces through multi-encoder, and employ multi-decoder to
make full use of the reduced spaces to generate values. Multi-encoder-decoder
architecture can significantly improve performance. Experiments show that CEDST
can achieve state-of-the-art results on two datasets and our constructed
datasets with many unknown values.

rigid registration, partly because it is harder to predict, validate and
understand non-rigid registration error. For instance, when surgeons see a
discrepancy in aligned image features, they may not be able to distinguish
between registration error and actual tissue deformation caused by tumor
resection. In this case, the spatial distribution of registration error could
help them make more informed decisions, e.g., ignoring the registration where
the estimated error is high. However, error estimates are difficult to acquire.
Probabilistic image registration (PIR) methods provide measures of registration
uncertainty, which could be a surrogate for assessing the registration error.
It is intuitive and believed by many clinicians that high uncertainty indicates
a large error. However, the monotonic association between uncertainty and error
has not been examined in image registration literature. In this pilot study, we
attempt to address this fundamental problem by looking at one PIR method, the
Gaussian process (GP) registration. We systematically investigate the relation
between GP uncertainty and error based on clinical data and show empirically
that there is a weak-to-moderate positive monotonic correlation between
point-wise GP registration uncertainty and non-rigid registration error.

in many problems of analysis (e.g., local linearization of functional

Banach spaces uses smooth bump functions. However, such functions are absent in
the majority of infinite-dimensional spaces. We suggest a new approach to
localization of Banach spaces with the help of locally identical maps, which we
call blid maps. In addition to smooth spaces, blid maps also allow to extend
local maps on non-smooth spaces (e.g., $C^q [0, 1]$, $q=0, 1, 2,...$).
  For the spaces possessing blid maps, we show how to reconstruct a map from
its derivatives at a point (see the Borel Lemma). We also demonstrate how blid
maps assist in finding global solutions of cohomological equations having
linear transformation of the argument. We present application of blid maps to
local differentiable linearization of maps on Banach spaces.
  We discuss differentiable localization for metric spaces (e.g.,
$C^{\infty}(\R)$), prove an extension result for locally defined maps and
present examples of such extensions for the specific metric spaces. In

hard component (2 - 10 keV), well matched by optically-thin plasma emission
with high temperature (kT ~ 8 keV). The XMM-Newton observations reveal
evolution of the X-ray emission from T CrB in its active phase. Namely, the
soft component in its spectrum is decreasing with time while the opposite is
true for the hard component. Comparison with data obtained in the quiescent
phase shows that the soft component is typical only for the active phase, while
the hard component is present in both phases but it is considerably stronger in
the quiescent phase. Presence of stochastic variability (flickering) on
time-scales of minutes and hours is confirmed both in X-rays and UV (UVM2

variability of 6000-6500 s is found for the first time in the soft X-ray

relevant dynamical variables, decreasing computational cost, and potentially
highlighting key dynamical mechanisms. In the absence of special dynamical
features such as scale separation or symmetries, the time evolution of these
variables typically exhibits memory effects. Recent work has found a variety of
data-driven model reduction methods to be effective for representing such
non-Markovian dynamics, but their scope and dynamical underpinning remain
incompletely understood. Here, we study data-driven model reduction from a
dynamical systems perspective. For both chaotic and randomly-forced systems, we
show the problem can be naturally formulated within the framework of Koopman
operators and the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism. We give a
heuristic derivation of a NARMAX (Nonlinear Auto-Regressive Moving Average with
eXogenous input) model from an underlying dynamical model. The derivation is
based on a simple construction we call Wiener projection, which links
Mori-Zwanzig theory to both NARMAX and to classical Wiener filtering. We apply
these ideas to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model of spatiotemporal chaos and a
viscous Burgers equation with stochastic forcing.

improving diagnosis and our understanding of cardiomyopathy, which in turn is
imperative for reducing risk of myocardial infarctions in patients.
Convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods for cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) image segmentation rely on supervision with pixel-level annotations, and
may not generalize well to images from a different domain. These methods are
typically sensitive to variations in imaging protocols and data acquisition.
Since annotating multi-sequence CMR images is tedious and subject to inter- and
intra-observer variations, developing methods that can automatically adapt from
one domain to the target domain is of great interest. In this paper, we propose
an approach for domain adaptation in multi-sequence CMR segmentation task using
transfer learning that combines multi-source image information. We first train
an encoder-decoder CNN on T2-weighted and balanced-Steady State Free Precession
(bSSFP) MR images with pixel-level annotation and fine-tune the same network
with a limited number of Late Gadolinium Enhanced-MR (LGE-MR) subjects, to
adapt the domain features. The domain-adapted network was trained with just
four LGE-MR training samples and obtained an average Dice score of $\sim$85.0\%
on the test set comprises of 40 LGE-MR subjects. The proposed method
significantly outperformed a network without adaptation trained from scratch on
the same set of LGE-MR training data.

magnetic field effect is approximately proportional to the solid angle
subtended by the spin moments on three neighbouring spin sites, termed the
scalar spin chirality. The entire spin chirality of the crystal, unless
macroscopically canceled, causes the geometrical Hall effect of real-space
Berry-phase origin, whereas the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a
conventional metallic ferromagnet is of the momentum-space Berry-phase origin
induced by relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we report the ordering
phenomena of the spin-trimer scalar spin chirality and the consequent large
geometrical Hall effect in the breathing kagom\'e lattice compound
Dy$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$, where the Dy$^{3+}$ moments form non-coplanar spin
trimers with local spin chirality. Using neutron diffraction, we show that the
local spin chirality of the spin trimers as well as its ferroic/antiferroic

generally an obstacle for OFDM systems as valuable information will be
completely lost. To overcome this concern, an objective function based on a
penalized atomic norm minimization (PANM) is provided in order to promote the
sparsity of time dispersive channels and impulsive noise. The corresponding
dual problem of the PANM is then converted to tractable semidefinite
programming. It has shown that one can simultaneously estimate the time
dispersive channels in a continuous dictionary and the location of impulsive
noise using the dual problem. Several numerical experiments are carried out to
evaluate the performance of the proposed estimator.

Ceres is the most accessible ocean world candidate and the largest reservoir of
water in the inner solar system. It shows active cryovolcanism and hydrothermal
activities in recent history that resulted in minerals not found in any other
planets to date except for Earth's upper crust. The possible occurrence of
recent subsurface ocean on Ceres and the complex geochemistry suggest possible
past habitability and even the potential for ongoing habitability. Aiming to
answer a broad spectrum of questions about the origin and evolution of Ceres
and its potential habitability, GAUSS will return samples from this possible
ocean world for the first time. The project will address the following
top-level scientific questions: 1) What is the origin of Ceres and the origin
and transfer of water and other volatiles in the inner solar system? 2) What
are the physical properties and internal structure of Ceres? What do they tell
us about the evolutionary and aqueous alteration history of icy dwarf planets?
3) What are the astrobiological implications of Ceres? Was it habitable in the
past and is it still today? 4) What are the mineralogical connections between
Ceres and our current collections of primitive meteorites? GAUSS will first
perform a high-resolution global remote sensing investigation, characterizing
the geophysical and geochemical properties of Ceres. Candidate sampling sites
will then be identified, and observation campaigns will be run for an in-depth
assessment of the candidate sites. Once the sampling site is selected, a lander
will be deployed on the surface to collect samples and return them to Earth in
cryogenic conditions that preserves the volatile and organic composition as
well as the original physical status as much as possible.

between the knees with and without radiographic osteoarthritis (OA). Bilateral
posterior-anterior knee radiographs were analyzed from the baseline of OAI and
MOST datasets. A fully automatic method to locate the most informative region
from subchondral bone using adaptive segmentation was developed. We used an
oversegmentation strategy for partitioning knee images into the compact regions
that follow natural texture boundaries. LBP, Fractal Dimension (FD), Haralick
features, Shannon entropy, and HOG methods were computed within the standard
ROI and within the proposed adaptive ROIs. Subsequently, we built logistic
regression models to identify and compare the performances of each texture
descriptor and each ROI placement method using 5-fold cross validation setting.
Importantly, we also investigated the generalizability of our approach by
training the models on OAI and testing them on MOST dataset.We used area under
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and average precision
(AP) obtained from the precision-recall (PR) curve to compare the results. We
found that the adaptive ROI improves the classification performance (OA vs.
non-OA) over the commonly used standard ROI (up to 9% percent increase in AUC).
We also observed that, from all texture parameters, LBP yielded the best
performance in all settings with the best AUC of 0.840 [0.825, 0.852] and
associated AP of 0.804 [0.786, 0.820]. Compared to the current state-of-the-art

capture a user's varying preferences on all items, especially when considering
the diverse characteristics of various items. To tackle this problem, in this
paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Attentive Metric Learning (MAML) method to
model user diverse preferences for various items. In particular, for each
user-item pair, we propose an attention neural network, which exploits the
item's multimodal features to estimate the user's special attention to
different aspects of this item. The obtained attention is then integrated into
a metric-based learning method to predict the user preference on this item. The
advantage of metric learning is that it can naturally overcome the problem of
dot product similarity, which is adopted by matrix factorization (MF) based
recommendation models but does not satisfy the triangle inequality property. In
addition, it is worth mentioning that the attention mechanism cannot only help
model user's diverse preferences towards different items, but also overcome the
geometrically restrictive problem caused by collaborative metric learning.
Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets show that our model
can substantially outperform the state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the
potential of modeling user diverse preference for recommendation.

Besides
winds powered by rotation they generate frequent magnetic flares, which launch
powerful blast waves into the wind. These internal shocks act as masers
producing fast (millisecond) radio bursts (FRBs) with the following properties.
(1) GHz radio emission occurs at radii $r\sim 10^{14}$ cm and lasts $\lesssim
1$ ms in observer's time. (2) Induced scattering in the surrounding wind does
not suppress the radio burst. (3) The emission has linear polarization set by
the magnetar rotation axis. (4) The emission drifts to lower frequencies during
the burst, and its duration broadens at lower frequencies. (5) Blast waves in
inhomogeneous winds may emit variable bursts; periodicity might appear on
sub-ms timescales if the magnetar rotates with $\sim 1$ s period. However, the
observed FRB structure is likely changed by lensing effects during propagation
through the host galaxy. (6) The FRBs from magnetars are expected to repeat,
with rare strong bursts (up to $\sim 10^{43}$ erg) or more frequent weak
bursts. (7) When a repeating flare strikes the wind bubble in the tail of a
previous flare, the FRB turns into a bright optical flash. Its luminosity may
approach that of a supernova Ia and last seconds. The rate of these optical
flashes in the universe is much lower than the FRB rate, however it may exceed
the supernova rate. Locations of hyper-active magnetars in their host galaxies
depend on how they form: magnetars created in supernovae explosions will trace
star formation regions, and magnetars formed in mergers of compact objects will
be offset. The merger magnetars are expected to be most energetic and
particularly hyper-active.

studied by approximate methods, which have their limits of validity and should
be checked against analytically solvable models. In this paper, we propose an
analytically solvable model to investigate the energy transfer between a
bosonic bath and a fermionic chain which are nonlinearly-coupled to each other.
The bosonic bath consists of an infinite collection of non-interacting bosonic
modes, while the fermionic chain is represented by a chain of interacting
fermions with nearest-neighbor interactions. We compare behaviors of the
temperature-dependent energy current $J_{T}$ and temperature-independent energy
current $J_{TI}$ for different bath configurations. With respect to the bath
spectrum, $J_{T}$ decays exponentially for Lorentz-Drude type bath, which is
the same as the conventional approximations. On the other hand, the decay rate
is $1/t^{3}$ for Ohmic type and $1/t$ for white noise, which doesn't have
conventional counterparts. For the temperature-independent current $J_{TI}$,
the decay rate is divergent for the Lorentz-Drude type bath, $1/t^{4}$ for the
Ohmic bath, and $1/t$ for the white noise. When further considering the
dynamics of the fermionic chain, the current will be modulated based on the
envelope from the bath. As an example, for a bosonic bath with Ohmic spectrum,
when the fermionic chain is uniformly-coupled, we have $J_{T}\propto1/t^{6}$
and $J_{TI}\propto1/t^{3}$. Remarkably, for perfect state transfer (PST)
couplings, there always exists an oscillating quantum energy current $J_{TI}$.
Moreover, it is interesting that $J_{T}$ is proportional to $(N-1)^{1/2}$ at
certain times for PST couplings under Lorentz-Drude or Ohmic bath.

Uranus and Neptune have the highest escape rates. Unless directly affected by a
stellar encounter itself, Jupiter frequently serves as a barrier that protects
the terrestrial planets from perturbations in the outer planetary system. In
low-density environments, Jupiter provides protection from perturbations in the
outer planetary system, while in high-density environments, direct
perturbations of Jupiter by neighbouring stars is disruptive to habitable-zone
planets. The diversity amongst planetary systems that is present in the star

relative to a pre-specified success criterion, usually a statistically
significant p-value. Such standard designs may not always suffice from a
clinical perspective because clinical relevance may call for more. For example,
proof-of-concept in phase II often requires not only statistical significance
but also a sufficiently large effect estimate.
  Purpose: We propose dual-criterion designs to complement statistical
significance with clinical relevance, discuss their methodology, and illustrate
their implementation in phase II.
  Methods: Clinical relevance requires the effect estimate to pass a clinically
motivated threshold (the decision value). In contrast to standard designs, the
required effect estimate is an explicit design input whereas study power is
implicit. The sample size for a dual-criterion design needs careful
considerations of the study's operating characteristics (type-I error, power).
  Results: Dual-criterion designs are discussed for a randomized controlled and
a single-arm phase II trial, including decision criteria, sample size
calculations, decisions under various data scenarios, and operating
characteristics. The designs facilitate GO/NO-GO decisions due to their
complementary statistical-clinical criterion.
  Conclusion: To improve evidence-based decision-making, a formal yet
transparent quantitative framework is important. Dual-criterion designs offer
an appealing statistical-clinical compromise, which may be preferable to
standard designs if evidence against the null hypothesis alone does not suffice
for an efficacy claim.

authorities need to analyze urban geospatial data to improve transportation and

that extract summarized information from point data (e.g., Uber rides)
contained in a given polygonal region (e.g., a city neighborhood). To support
such queries, current analysis tools either allow only predefined aggregates on
predefined regions and are thus unsuitable for exploratory analyses, or access
the raw data to compute aggregate results on-the-fly, which severely limits the
interactivity. At the same time, existing pre-aggregation techniques are
inadequate since they maintain aggregates over rectangular regions. As a
result, when applied over arbitrary polygonal regions, they induce an
approximation error that cannot be bounded. In this paper, we introduce
GeoBlocks, a novel pre-aggregating data structure that supports spatial
aggregation over arbitrary polygons. GeoBlocks closely approximate polygons
using a set of fine-grained grid cells and, in contrast to prior work, allow to
bound the approximation error by adjusting the cell size. Furthermore,
GeoBlocks employ a trie-like cache that caches aggregate results of frequently
queried regions, thereby dynamically adapting to the skew inherently present in
query workloads and improving performance over time. In summary, GeoBlocks
outperform on-the-fly aggregation by up to three orders of magnitude, achieving
the sub-second query latencies required for interactive exploratory analytics.

leads to a weak proton heating that is not sufficient to overcome the

activity has a low amplitude with wave vectors quasi-parallel/oblique with

turbulent cascade and is discernible in one-dimensional power spectra taken
only in the direction quasi-parallel/oblique with respect to the ambient
magnetic field; at quasi-perpendicular angles the wave activity is hidden by
the turbulent background. These waves are partly reabsorbed by protons and
partly couple to and participate in the turbulent cascade. Their presence
reduces kurtosis, a measure of intermittency, and the Shannon entropy but

size, the research community implicitly sets ad-hoc standards by means of the
peer review process. We hypothesize that peer review requires researchers to
report the use of ever-increasing datasets as one condition for acceptance of
their work to reputable publication venues. To test this hypothesis, we scanned
the proceedings of the eminent MICCAI (Medical Image Computing and
Computer-Assisted Intervention) conferences from 2011 to 2018. From a total of
2136 articles, we focused on 907 papers involving human datasets of MRI
(Magnetic Resonance Imaging), CT (Computed Tomography) and fMRI (functional
MRI) images. For each modality, for each of the years 2011-2018 we calculated
the average, geometric mean and median number of human subjects used in that
year's MICCAI articles. The results corroborate the dataset growth hypothesis.
Specifically, the annual median dataset size in MICCAI articles has grown
roughly 3-10 times from 2011 to 2018, depending on the imaging modality.
Statistical analysis further supports the dataset growth hypothesis and reveals
exponential growth of the geometric mean dataset size, with annual growth of
about 21% for MRI, 24% for CT and 31% for fMRI. In slight analogy to Moore's
law, the results can provide guidance about trends in the expectations of the

multiple spectral channels give information on the emission as a function of
temperature through differential emission measure (DEM) inversions. The aim of
this paper is to describe, test, and apply a new DEM method named the Solar
Iterative Temperature Emission Solver (SITES). The method creates an initial
DEM estimate through a direct redistribution of observed intensities across
temperatures according to the temperature response function of the measurement,
and iteratively improves on this estimate through calculation of intensity
residuals. It is simple in concept and implementation, is non-subjective in the
sense that no prior constraints are placed on the solutions other than
positivity and smoothness, and can process a thousand DEMs per second on a
standard desktop computer. The resulting DEMs replicate model DEMs well in
tests on Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) synthetic data. The same tests show
that SITES performs less well on very narrow DEM peaks, and should not be used
for temperature diagnostics below ~0.5MK in the case of AIA observations. The
SITES accuracy of inversion compares well with two other established methods. A
simple yet powerful new method to visualise DEM maps is introduced, based on a
fractional emission measure (FEM). Applied to a set of AIA full-disk images,
the SITES method and FEM visualisation show very effectively the dominance of
certain temperature regimes in different large-scale coronal structures. The
method can easily be adapted for any multi-channel observations of
optically-thin plasma and, given its simplicity and efficiency, will facilitate
the processing of large existing and future datasets.

ratio transmission, a novel framework is developed and leveraged to derive
upper and lower bounds on the UAV-UE coverage probability for both scenarios.
Using the derived results, the effects of various system parameters such as
collaboration distance, UAVUE altitude, and UAV-UE velocity on the achievable
performance are studied. Results reveal that, for both static and mobile UAV
user equipments, when the BS antennas are tilted downwards, the coverage
probability of a high-altitude UAV-UE is upper bounded by that of ground users
regardless of the transmission scheme. Moreover, for low

improve the coverage probability of UAV user equipments, e.g., from 28% under

features are extremely original. This is especially true for its atmosphere,
where high pressures and temperatures are found at the ground level. In these
conditions, carbon dioxide, the main component of Venus' atmosphere, is a
supercritical fluid. The analysis of VeGa-2 probe data has revealed the high
instability of the region located in the last few kilometers above the ground
level. Recent works have suggested an explanation based on the existence of a
vertical gradient of molecular nitrogen abundances, around 5 ppm per meter. Our
goal was then to identify which physical processes could lead to the
establishment of this intriguing nitrogen gradient, in the deep atmosphere of
Venus. Using an appropriate equation of state for the binary mixture CO2-N2
under supercritical conditions, and also molecular dynamics simulations, we
have investigated the separation processes of N2 and CO2 in the Venusian
context. Our results show that molecular diffusion is strongly inefficient, and
potential phase separation is an unlikely mechanism. We have compared the
quantity of CO2 required to form the proposed gradient with what could be
released by a diffuse degassing from a low volcanic activity. The needed fluxes
of CO2 are not so different from what can be measured over some terrestrial
volcanic systems, suggesting a similar effect at work on Venus.

learning architecture, inherited from the parameter server design, relies on
highly centralized topologies and the assumption of large nodes-to-server
bandwidths. However, in real-world federated learning scenarios the network
capacities between nodes are highly uniformly distributed and smaller than that
in a datacenter. It is of great challenges for conventional federated learning
approaches to efficiently utilize network capacities between nodes. In this
paper, we propose a model segment level decentralized federated learning to
tackle this problem. In particular, we propose a segmented gossip approach,
which not only makes full utilization of node-to-node bandwidth, but also has
good training convergence. The experimental results show that even the training

on problem solving and discovery. This hampers the development of innovative
solutions. Additionally, little has been said about how to capture and
represent the real user needs. To fill this gap, some authors argue in favor of
the application of Creative thinking for requirements elicitation within agile
software development. This synergy between creativeness and agility has arisen
as a new means of bringing innovation and flexibility to increasingly demanding
software. The aim of the present study is therefore to employ a systematic
review to investigate the state-of-the-art of those approaches that leverage
creativity in requirements elicitation within Agile Software Development, as
well as the benefits, limitations and strength of evidence of these approaches.
The search strategy identified 1451 studies. The selected studies contained 13
different and unique proposals. These approaches provide evidence that enhanced
creativity in requirements elicitation can be successfully implemented in real
software projects. We specifically observed that projects related to user
interface development, such as those for mobile or web applications, are good
candidates for the use of these approaches. We have also found that agile
methodologies are preferred when introducing creativity into requirements
elicitation. Despite this being a new research field, there is a mixture of
techniques, tools and processes that have already been and are currently being
successfully tested in industry. Finally, we have found that, although
creativity is an important ingredient with which to bring about innovation, it
is not always sufficient to generate new requirements because this needs to be
followed by user engagement and a specific context in which proper conditions,
such as flexibility, time or resources, have to be met.

at these level anti-crossings is that individual transition amplitudes are

half-metallic ferromagnetism in equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy CoRuMnSi.
Room temperature XRD analysis reveals that the alloy crystallizes in L21
disorder instead of pristine Y-type structure due to 50% swap disorder between
the tetrahedral sites, i.e., Co and Ru atoms. Magnetization measurements reveal
a net magnetization of 4 $\mu_B$ with Curie temperature of ~780 K. Resistivity
measurement reveals the presence of localization effect below 35 K while above
100 K, a linear dependence is observed. Resistivity behavior indicates the
absence of single magnon scattering, which indirectly supports the
half-metallic nature. The majority spin band near the Fermi level clearly
indicates the overlap of flat eg bands with sharply varying conduction bands
that are responsible for the localization. In-depth analysis of the projected
atomic d-orbital character of band structure reveals unusual bonding, giving
rise to the flat eg bands purely arising out of Ru ions. Co-Ru swap disorder
calculations indicate the robustness of half-metallic nature, even when the
structure changes from Y-type to L21-type, with no major change in the net
magnetization of the system. Thus, robust half-metallic nature, stable
structure, and high Curie temperature make this alloy quite a promising
candidate to be used as a source of highly spin-polarized currents in
spintronic applications.

of biotic and abiotic environmental variables. However, the characteristics of

hypothesize that this is problematic and results in models that can reproduce
training data but are unable to make spatial predictions beyond the locations
of the training samples. We assume that not only spatial validation strategies
but also spatial variable selection is essential for reliable spatial
predictions. We introduce two case studies that use remote sensing to predict
land cover and the leaf area index for the ""Marburg Open Forest"", an open
research and education site of Marburg University, Germany. We use the machine
learning algorithm Random Forests to train models using non-spatial and spatial
cross-validation strategies to understand how spatial variable selection
affects the predictions. Our findings confirm that spatial cross-validation is
essential in preventing overoptimistic model performance. We further show that
highly autocorrelated predictors (such as geolocation variables, e.g. latitude,
longitude) can lead to considerable overfitting and result in models that can
reproduce the training data but fail in making spatial predictions. The problem
becomes apparent in the visual assessment of the spatial predictions that show
clear artefacts that can be traced back to a misinterpretation of the spatially
autocorrelated predictors by the algorithm. Spatial variable selection could
automatically detect and remove such variables that lead to overfitting,
resulting in reliable spatial prediction patterns and improved statistical
spatial model performance. We conclude that in addition to spatial validation,
a spatial variable selection must be considered in spatial predictions of
ecological data to produce reliable predictions.

establish the existence of a regular density $a$ and to determine the

It can be performed with very sparse antenna arrays and yields a pure
measurement of the electromagnetic air-shower component, thus delivering
information that is highly complementary to the measurement of the muonic
component using particle detectors. However, radio-based reconstruction of
inclined air showers is challenging in light of asymmetries induced in the
radio-signal distribution by early-late effects as well as the superposition of
geomagnetic and charge-excess radiation. We present a model for the signal
distribution of radio emission from inclined air showers which allows explicit
compensation of these asymmetries. In a first step, geometrical early-late
asymmetries are removed. Secondly, a universal parameterization of the
charge-excess fraction as a function of the air-shower geometry, the
atmospheric density profile and the lateral distance from the shower axis is
used to compensate for the charge-excess contribution to the signal. The
resulting signal distribution of the pure geomagnetic emission is then fit with
a rotationally symmetric lateral distribution function, the area integration of
which yields the radiation energy as an estimator for the cosmic-ray energy. We
present the details and performance of our model, which lays the foundation for

Adaptive Structure-constrained Low-Rank Coding (AS-LRC) for the latent
representation of data. To recover the underlying subspaces more accurately,
AS-LRC seamlessly integrates an adaptive weighting based block-diagonal
structure-constrained low-rank representation and the group sparse salient
feature extraction into a unified framework. Specifically, AS-LRC performs the
latent decomposition of given data into a low-rank reconstruction by a
block-diagonal codes matrix, a group sparse locality-adaptive salient feature
part and a sparse error part. To enforce the block-diagonal structures adaptive
to different real datasets for the low-rank recovery, AS-LRC clearly computes
an auto-weighting matrix based on the locality-adaptive features and multiplies
by the low-rank coefficients for direct minimization at the same time. This
encourages the codes to be block-diagonal and can avoid the tricky issue of
choosing optimal neighborhood size or kernel width for the weight assignment,
suffered in most local geometrical structures-preserving low-rank coding
methods. In addition, our AS-LRC selects the L2,1-norm on the projection for
extracting group sparse features rather than learning low-rank features by
Nuclear-norm regularization, which can make learnt features robust to noise and
outliers in samples, and can also make the feature coding process efficient.
Extensive visualizations and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our AS-LRC for image representation and recovery.

samples may not hold. Furthermore, in scientific applications, the covariance
structure of the features may contain important signals and its learning is
also affected by latent group structure. We propose a class of mixture models
for paired data (X, Y) that couples together the distribution of X (using
sparse graphical models) and the conditional Y | X (using sparse regression
models). The regression and graphical models are specific to the latent groups
and model parameters are estimated jointly (hence the name ""regularized joint

automatic control of confounding by such structure. Estimation is handled via
an expectation-maximization algorithm, whose convergence is established

scenario of twin-projective latent flexible DPL under a structured
twin-incoherence. Technically, a novel framework called Twin-Projective Latent
Flexible DPL (TP-DPL) is proposed, which minimizes the twin-incoherence
constrained flexibly-relaxed reconstruction error to avoid the possible
over-fitting issue and produce accurate reconstruction. In this setting, our
TP-DPL integrates the twin-incoherence based latent flexible DPL and the joint
embedding of codes as well as salient features by twin-projection into a
unified model in an adaptive neighborhood-preserving manner. As a result,
TP-DPL unifies the salient feature extraction, representation and
classification. The twin-incoherence constraint on codes and features can
explicitly ensure high intra-class compactness and inter-class separation over
them. TP-DPL also integrates the adaptive weighting to preserve the local
neighborhood of the coefficients and salient features within each class
explicitly. For efficiency, TP-DPL uses Frobenius-norm and abandons the costly
l0/l1-norm for group sparse representation. Another byproduct is that TP-DPL
can directly apply the class-specific twin-projective reconstruction residual
to compute the label of data. Extensive results on public databases show that
TP-DPL can deliver the state-of-the-art performance.

analysis is the indiscriminate mixing of image properties, e.g. artifacts and

feature encoding for the relevant task and thus lead to poor generalization of
deep learning algorithms. In this paper we propose a novel representation
disentanglement method to extract semantically meaningful and generalizable
features for different tasks within a multi-task learning framework. Deep
neural networks are utilized to ensure that the encoded features are maximally
informative with respect to relevant tasks, while an adversarial regularization
encourages these features to be disentangled and minimally informative about
irrelevant tasks. We aim to use the disentangled representations to generalize
the applicability of deep neural networks. We demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed method on synthetic data as well as fetal ultrasound images. Our
experiments illustrate that our method is capable of learning disentangled
internal representations. It outperforms baseline methods in multiple tasks,
especially on images with new properties, e.g. previously unseen artifacts in
fetal ultrasound.

recognition (ASR) errors using a finite state transducer (FST) intent
recognition framework. Intent recognition is a powerful technique for dialog
flow management in turn-oriented, human-machine dialogs. This technique can
also be very useful in the context of human-human dialogs, though it serves a
different purpose of key insight extraction from conversations. We argue that
currently available intent recognition techniques are not applicable to
human-human dialogs due to the complex structure of turn-taking and various
disfluencies encountered in spontaneous conversations, exacerbated by speech
recognition errors and scarcity of domain-specific labeled data. Without
efficient key insight extraction techniques, raw human-human dialog transcripts
remain significantly unexploited.
  Our contribution consists of a novel FST for intent indexing and an algorithm
for fuzzy intent search over the lattice - a compact graph encoding of ASR's
hypotheses. We also develop a pruning strategy to constrain the fuzziness of
the FST index search. Extracted intents represent linguistic domain knowledge
and help us improve (rescore) the original transcript. We compare our method
with a baseline, which uses only the most likely transcript hypothesis (best
path), and find an increase in the total number of recognized intents by 25%.

of spiking activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons. To interpret these
large-scale data, several methods have been proposed to infer latent dynamic
structure from high-dimensional datasets. One recent line of work uses
recurrent neural networks in a sequential autoencoder (SAE) framework to
uncover dynamics. SAEs are an appealing option for modeling nonlinear dynamical
systems, and enable a precise link between neural activity and behavior on a
single-trial basis. However, the very large parameter count and complexity of
SAEs relative to other models has caused concern that SAEs may only perform
well on very large training sets. We hypothesized that with a method to
systematically optimize hyperparameters (HPs), SAEs might perform well even in
cases of limited training data. Such a breakthrough would greatly extend their
applicability. However, we find that SAEs applied to spiking neural data are
prone to a particular form of overfitting that cannot be detected using
standard validation metrics, which prevents standard HP searches. We develop
and test two potential solutions: an alternate validation method (""sample
validation"") and a novel regularization method (""coordinated dropout""). These
innovations prevent overfitting quite effectively, and allow us to test whether
SAEs can achieve good performance on limited data through large-scale HP
optimization. When applied to data from motor cortex recorded while monkeys
made reaches in various directions, large-scale HP optimization allowed SAEs to
better maintain performance for small dataset sizes. Our results should greatly

defensive distillation to networks for image classification, we examine, for
the first time, its performance on text classification tasks and also evaluate

heavy-duty, high-usage-frequency nature and a high carbon intensity per vehicle

emissions and potentially save energy costs in the context of rising fuel
prices, if a proper energy management of airport service electric vehicles
(ASEVs) is performed. To perform such an energy management, this paper proposes
a new customized rollout approach, as a near-optimal control method for a new
ASEV dynamics model, which models the ASEV states, their transitions over time,
and how control decisions affect them. The rollout approach yields a
near-optimal control strategy for the ASEVs to transport luggage and to charge
batteries, with the objective to minimize the operation cost, which
incentivizes the charging of the ASEVs to match renewable generation. Case
studies demonstrate that the rollout approach effectively overcomes the ""curse
of dimensionality"". On both typical summer and winter days, the rollout
algorithm results in a total cost approximately 10% less than that of the
underlying ""greedy charging"" heuristic, which charges a battery whenever its
state of charge is not the maximum. The rollout algorithm is proven to be
adaptive towards flight schedule changes at short notice.

However, we lack quantitative evaluation of tracker robustness to different

address these two problems by constructing a Blurred Video Tracking benchmark,

  Circuits",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finding a maximum or minimum is a fundamental building block in many
mathematical models. Compared with classical algorithms, Durr, Hoyer's quantum
algorithm (DHA) achieves quadratic speed. However, its key step, the quantum
exponential searching algorithm (QESA), which is based on Grover algorithm, is
not a sure-success algorithm. Meanwhile, quantum circuits encounter the gate
decomposition problem due to variation of the scale of data. In this paper, we
propose an optimized quantum algorithm for searching maximum and minimum, based
on DHA and the optimal quantum exact search algorithm. Furthermore, we provide
the corresponding quantum circuits, together with three equivalent
simplifications. In circumstances when we can exactly estimate the ratio of the
number of solutions M and the searched space N, our method can improve the
successful probability close to 100%. Furthermore, compared with DHA, our
algorithm shows an advantage in complexity with large databases and in the gate
complexity of constructing oracles. Experiments have been executed on an IBM
superconducting processor with two qubits, and a practical problem of finding
the minimum from Titanic passengers' age was numerically simulated. Both showed
that our optimized maximum or minimum performs more efficiently compared with
DHA. Our algorithm can serve as an important subroutine in various quantum
algorithms which involves searching maximum or minimum.

superfluids in the inner cores of neutron stars. $^3P_2$ superfluids offer a
rich phase diagram including uniaxial/biaxial nematic phases, the ferromagnetic
phase, and the cyclic phase. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation as
superfluid Fermi liquid theory, we show that a strong (weak) magnetic field
drives the first (second) order transition from the dihedral-two biaxial
nematic phase to dihedral-four biaxial nematic phase in low (high)
temperatures, and their phase boundaries are divided by the critical endpoint
(CEP). We demonstrate that the set of critical exponents at the CEP satisfies
the Rushbrooke, Griffiths, and Widom equalities, indicating a new universality
class. At the CEP, the $^3P_2$ superfluid exhibits critical behavior with
nontrivial critical exponents, indicating a new universality class.
Furthermore, we find that the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation up to the 8th-order
expansion satisfies three equalities and properly captures the physics of the
CEP. This implies that the GL theory can provide a tractable way for
understanding critical phenomena which may be realized in the dense core of
realistic magnetars.

properties of totally disconnected locally compact groups, TDLC-groups, by
analogy with the theory for discrete groups. We provide a characterization of
hyperbolic TDLC-groups, in terms of homological isoperimetric inequalities.
This characterization is used to prove the main result of the article: for
hyperbolic TDLC-groups with rational discrete cohomological dimension $\leq 2$,
hyperbolicity is inherited by compactly presented closed subgroups. As a
consequence, every compactly presented closed subgroup of the automorphism
group $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ of a negatively curved locally finite $2$-dimensional
building $X$ is a hyperbolic TDLC-group, whenever $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ acts with
finitely many orbits on $X$. Examples where this result applies include
hyperbolic Bourdon's buildings.
  We revisit the construction of small cancellation quotients of amalgamated
free products, and verify that it provides examples of hyperbolic TDLC-groups
of rational discrete cohomological dimension $2$ when applied to amalgamated
products of profinite groups over open subgroups.
  We raise the question of whether our main result can be extended to locally
compact hyperbolic groups if rational discrete cohomological dimension is
replaced by asymptotic dimension. We prove that this is the case for discrete
groups and sketch an argument for TDLC-groups.

unlensed sample by directly performing multi-wavelength spectral energy

with the more numerous $z \sim 2$ DSFG population. The ultrared sample has a
median redshift of 3.3, stellar mass of 3.7 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$,

proposed channel access policy and the framework's tolerance against
uncertainty, we explore different channel switching patterns and different

exploits hierarchical recurrence at different depths within the graph to enable
exploration of changes in temporal neighbourhoods, whilst requiring no
additional features or labels to be present. The final vertex representations
are created using variational sampling and are optimised to directly predict
the next graph in the sequence. Our claims are reinforced by extensive
experimental evaluation on both real and synthetic benchmark datasets, where
our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to competing methods,
out-performing them at predicting new temporal edges by as much as 23% on
real-world datasets, whilst also requiring fewer overall model parameters.

dividing an image into multiple patches and modifying the role of the
generative network from producing an entire image, at once, to creating a
sparse representation vector for each image patch. We synthesize an entire

output of the generator to a particular structure, obtained by imposing a Union

realistic images, while maintaining a desired diversity. To further regularize
GANs in generating high-quality images and to avoid the notorious mode-collapse

utilizes an auto-encoding scheme to ensure that first, the input-output

turbulence, are characterized by persistent and intermittent energy transfer
between various spatial and temporal scales. These systems are difficult to
model and analyze due to combination of high dimensionality and uncertainty,
and there has been much interest in obtaining reduced models, in the form of
stochastic closures, that can replicate their non-Gaussian statistics in many
dimensions. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to model stationary
chaotic dynamical systems through nonlinear transformations and a set of
decoupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Specifically, we use
optimal transport to find a transformation from the distribution of time-series
data to a multiplicative reference probability measure such as the standard
normal distribution. Then we find the set of decoupled SDEs that admit the
reference measure as the invariant measure, and also closely match the spectrum
of the transformed data. As such, this framework represents the chaotic time
series as the evolution of a stochastic system observed through the lens of a
nonlinear map. We demonstrate the application of this framework in Lorenz-96
system, a 10-dimensional model of high-Reynolds cavity flow, and reanalysis
climate data. These examples show that SDE models generated by this framework
can reproduce the non-Gaussian statistics of systems with moderate dimensions
(e.g. 10 and more), and predict super-Gaussian tails that are not readily
available from little training data. These findings suggest that this class of

the Dirac Lagrangian on a spacetime where time does not advance along the
worldlines of fundamental dust particles, called an 'internal spacetime'. The
aim of internal spacetime geometry is to model certain quantum phenomena using
(classical) degenerate spacetime metrics. For example, on an internal
spacetime, tangent spaces have variable dimension, and spin wavefunction
collapse is modeled by the projection from one tangent space to another. In
this article we show that the combinatorial structure of the internal Dirac
Lagrangian yields precisely the standard model trivalent vertices, together
with two additional new (longitudinal) Z vertices that generate the four-valent
boson vertices. In particular, we are able to derive electroweak parity
violation for both leptons and quarks. We also obtain new restrictions on the
possible spin states that can occur in certain interactions. Finally, we
determine the trivalent vertices of the new massive spin-2 boson predicted by
the model.

graph nodes, such as average hitting times of random walks, cosine distances
from DeepWalk, personalized PageRank, etc. Successful although these algorithms
are, still they are either underperforming or too time-consuming to be
applicable to huge graphs that we encounter daily in this big data era. To
address these issues, here we propose a faster algorithm based on an improved
version of random walks that can beat DeepWalk results with more than ten times
acceleration. The reason for this significant acceleration is that we can
derive an analytical formula to calculate the expected hitting times of this
random walk quickly. There is only one parameter (the power expansion order) in
our algorithm, and the results are robust with respect to its changes.
Therefore, we can directly find the optimal solution without fine-tuning of
model parameters. Our method can be widely used for fraud detection, targeted
ads, recommendation systems, topic-sensitive search, etc.

networks utilizing the heterogeneous random key predistribution scheme, where
each sensor node is classified as class-$i$ with probability $\mu_i$ for
$i=1,\ldots,r$ with $\mu_i>0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^r \mu_i=1$. A class-$i$ sensor is
given $K_i$ cryptographic keys selected uniformly at random from a key pool of
size $P$. After deployment, two nodes can communicate securely if they share at
least one cryptographic key. We consider the wireless connectivity of the
network using a heterogeneous on-off channel model, where the channel between a
class-$i$ node and a class-$j$ node is on (respectively, off) with probability
$\alpha_{ij}$ (respectively, $1-\alpha_{ij}$) for $i,j=1,\ldots,r$.
Collectively, two sensor nodes are adjacent if they i) share a cryptographic
key and ii) have a wireless channel in between that is on. We model the overall
network using a composite random graph obtained by the intersection of
inhomogeneous random key graphs (IRKG) $\mathbb{K}(n;\pmb{\mu},\pmb{K},P)$ with
inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs (IERG) $\mathbb{G}(n;\pmb{\mu},
\pmb{\alpha})$. The former graph is naturally induced by the heterogeneous
random key predistribution scheme, while the latter is induced by the
heterogeneous on-off channel model. More specifically, two nodes are adjacent
in the composite graph if they are i) adjacent in the IRKG i.e., share a
cryptographic key and ii) adjacent in the IERG, i.e., have an available
wireless channel. We investigate the connectivity of the composite random graph
and present conditions (in the form of zero-one laws) on how to scale its
parameters so that it i) has no secure node which is isolated and ii) is
securely connected, both with high probability when the number of nodes gets
large. We also present numerical results to support these zero-one laws in the
finite-node regime.

In this study, we investigate lower limits on the reheating temperature imposed

massive particles. For the first time, effects of neutrino self-interactions
and oscillations are taken into account in the neutrino thermalization
calculations. By requiring consistency between theoretical and observational
values of light element abundances, we find that the reheating temperature
should conservatively be $T_{\rm RH} \gtrsim 1.8$ MeV in the case of the 100%
radiative decay, and $T_{\rm RH} \gtrsim$ 4-5 MeV in the case of the 100%

Swift","MOD: Minimally Ordered Durable Datastructures for Persistent Memory","13 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Persistent Memory (PM) makes possible recoverable applications that can
preserve application progress across system reboots and power failures. Actual
recoverability requires careful ordering of cacheline flushes, currently done
in two extreme ways. On one hand, expert programmers have reasoned deeply about
consistency and durability to create applications centered on a single
custom-crafted durable datastructure. On the other hand, less-expert
programmers have used software transaction memory (STM) to make atomic one or
more updates, albeit at a significant performance cost due largely to ordered
log updates.
  In this work, we propose the middle ground of composable persistent
datastructures called Minimally Ordered Durable (MOD) datastructures. MOD is a
C++ library of several datastructures---currently, map, set, stack, queue and
vector--- that often perform better than STM and yet are relatively easy to
use. They allow multiple updates to one or more datastructures to be atomic
with respect to failure. Moreover, we provide a recipe to create more
recoverable datastructures.
  MOD is motivated by our analysis of real Intel Optane PM hardware showing
that allowing unordered, overlapping flushes significantly improves
performance. MOD reduces ordering by adapting existing techniques for
out-of-place updates (like shadow paging) with space-reducing structural
sharing (from functional programming). MOD exposes a Basic interface for single
updates and a Composition interface for atomically performing multiple updates.
Relative to the state-of-the-art Intel PMDK v1.5 STM, MOD improves map, set,
stack, queue microbenchmark performance by 40%, and speeds up application
benchmark performance by 38%.

a harmonic model, and then on methane and methanium, where we evaluate all

emerged recently and will continue to raise interest at least for the next few
years. The rate of research development in this area is growing very rapidly.
Novelty of this research direction resides mainly in the peculiarity of the
application field, rather than in the methodological approaches, which are (at
least up to now) state-of-the-art ML algorithms. Reviewing the literature shows
that many of the ML algorithms have not yet been used in this area, and many of
the OC applications are not considered yet, which reflects the fact that the
research topic is pristine. Accordingly, tutorial investigations are quiet
necessary in this filed to help researchers be aware about the last
progressions and cavities of this field. Although several tutorials have been
released recently, they considered this topic from OC view, and neglected ML
view. However, it is required to have an investigations about the ML algorithms
used in this subject. Accordingly, for the first time, this paper reviews ML
for OC literature from ML viewpoint. This view could be really helpful because
only OC experts work on ML for OC, and they are not ML experts, so it could
really help them to have a comprehensive view on the ML subjects implantable in
OC. It has worth to mention that compared with other works, this survey reviews
much more investigations; therefore, it has more generality, and gives the
reader to have a comprehensive overview on this topic.
