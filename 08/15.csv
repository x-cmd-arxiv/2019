the exfoliated films of layered single crystals of antiferromagnetic FePS3 and
MnPS3 semiconductors. The Raman spectroscopy was conducted using three
different excitation lasers with the wavelengths of 325 nm (UV), 488 nm (blue),
and 633 nm (red). The resonant UV-Raman spectroscopy reveals new spectral
features, which are not detectable via visible Raman light scattering. The
thermal conductivity of FePS3 and MnPS3 thin films was measured by two
different techniques: the steady-state Raman optothermal and transient
time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. The Raman optothermal measurements
provided the orientation-average thermal conductivity of FePS3 to be 1.35 W/mK
at room temperature. The transient measurements revealed that the through-plane
and in-plane thermal conductivity of FePS3 is 0.85 W/mK and 2.7 W/mK,
respectively. The films of MnPS3 have higher thermal conductivity of 1.1 W/mK
through-plane and 6.3 W/mK in-plane. The data obtained by both techniques
reveal strong thermal anisotropy of the films and the dominant contribution of
phonons to heat conduction. Our results are important for the proposed
applications of the antiferromagnetic semiconductor thin films in spintronic
devices.

phenomena relies primarily on the accuracy of analytical methods used. In
quantum mechanics, many of such interactions such as those found in quantum
optomechanics and quantum computing have a highly nonlinear nature, which makes
their analysis extraordinarily difficult using classical schemes. Typically,
modern quantum systems of interest nowadays come with four basic properties:
(i) quantumness, (ii) openness, (iii) randomness, and (iv) nonlinearity. The
newly introduced method of higher-order operators targets analytical solutions
to such systems, and while providing at least mathematically approximate
expressions with improved accuracy over the fully linearized schemes, some
cases admit exact solutions. Many different applications of this method in
quantum and classically nonlinear systems are demonstrated throughout. This
review is purposed to provide the reader with ease of access to this recent and
well-established operator algebra, while going over a moderate amount of
literature review. The reader with basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and
quantum noise theory should be able to start using this scheme to his or her

important statistical measure and the task of estimating them arises in many
applications within data analysis and machine learning. Two of the most popular
algorithms for this problem, Count-Min and Count-Sketch, are widely used in
practice.
  In a recent work [Hsu et al., ICLR'19], it was shown empirically that
augmenting Count-Min and Count-Sketch with a machine learning algorithm leads
to a significant reduction of the estimation error. The experiments were
complemented with an analysis of the expected error incurred by Count-Min (both
the standard and the augmented version) when the input frequencies follow a
Zipfian distribution. Although the authors established that the learned version
of Count-Min has lower estimation error than its standard counterpart, their
analysis of the standard Count-Min algorithm was not tight. Moreover, they
provided no similar analysis for Count-Sketch.
  In this paper we resolve these problems. First, we provide a simple tight
analysis of the expected error incurred by Count-Min. Second, we provide the
first error bounds for both the standard and the augmented version of
Count-Sketch. These bounds are nearly tight and again demonstrate an improved
performance of the learned version of Count-Sketch.
  In addition to demonstrating tight gaps between the aforementioned
algorithms, we believe that our bounds for the standard versions of Count-Min
and Count-Sketch are of independent interest. In particular, it is a typical
practice to set the number of hash functions in those algorithms to $\Theta
(\log n)$. In contrast, our results show that to minimize the \emph{expected}
error, the number of hash functions should be a constant, strictly greater than
$1$.

opportunities of the proposed approach. The point and interval estimates of net

obtained. The resulting estimate of claims reserves falls in the range of
reasonable estimates calculated on the basis of traditional reserving methods
(the chain-ladder method, the frequency-severity method and the
Bornhuetter-Ferguson method).
  The proposed methodology is based on additive estimates of a company's
financial indicators, in the sense that they are calculated as a sum of
estimates built separately for each element of the sample (claim). This allows
using the proposed methodology to model insurance companies' financial flows
and, in particular, to solve the problems of reserve redistribution between
particular segments of insurance portfolio and/or time intervals; to adjust
risk as part of financial reporting under IAS 17 Insurance Contracts; and to
deal with many other tasks.
  The accuracy of insurance companies' financial parameters estimate based on

structurally stable then the trained ESN will exhibit dynamics that are
topologically conjugate to the future behaviour of the observed dynamical
system. Our theoretical results connect the theory of ESNs to the
delay-embedding literature for dynamical systems, and are supported by
numerical evidence from simulations of the traditional Lorenz equations. The

Using this technique, we rapidly predict the substantial modification of charge

many cellular processes such as cell adhesion, endocytosis, fibrillar

clusters on the surface of the PM plays an important role in governing their
heterogeneous surface distribution. However, the stability behavior of the
surface distribution of protein aggregates remains poorly understood.
Therefore, understanding the spatial patterns that can emerge on the PM solely
through protein-protein interaction, lateral diffusion, and feedback is an
important step towards a complete description of the mechanisms behind protein
clustering on the cell surface. In this work, we investigate the pattern
formation of a reaction-diffusion model that describes the dynamics of a system
of ligand-receptor complexes. The purely diffusive ligand in the cytosol can
bind receptors in the PM, and the resultant ligand-receptor complexes not only
diffuse laterally but can also form clusters resulting in different oligomers.
Finally, the largest oligomers recruit ligands from the cytosol in a positive
feedback. From a methodological viewpoint, we provide theoretical estimates for
diffusion-driven instabilities of the protein aggregates based on the Turing
mechanism. Our main result is a threshold phenomenon, in which a sufficiently
high recruitment of ligands promotes the input of new monomeric components and
consequently drives the formation of a single-patch spatially heterogeneous
steady-state.

constant-rank matrices, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm
is also minimized for variable-rank ${\cal H}^2$-matrices. The proposed work

models in a drone cellular network in which drone base stations (DBSs) serve
user equipments (UEs) on the ground. In particular, we consider the following
four mobility models: (i) straight line (SL), (ii) random stop (RS), (iii)
random walk (RW), and (iv) random waypoint (RWP), among which the SL mobility
model is inspired by the simulation models used by the third generation
partnership project (3GPP) for the placement and trajectory of drones, while
the other three are well-known canonical models (or their variants) that offer
a useful balance between realism and tractability. Assuming the
nearest-neighbor association policy, we consider two service models for the
UEs: (i) UE independent model (UIM), and (ii) UE dependent model (UDM). While
the serving DBS follows the same mobility model as the other DBSs in the UIM,
it is assumed to fly towards the UE of interest in the UDM and hover above its
location after reaching there. The main contribution of this paper is a unified
approach to characterize the point process of DBSs for all the mobility and
service models. Using this, we provide exact mathematical expressions for the
average received rate and the session rate as seen by the typical UE. Further,

simple SL mobility model provides a lower bound on the performance of other

independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). To the best of our knowledge,

combining the recent technique of quantum singular value transformations with
the method of estimating normalised traces in the one clean qubit model. We
consider an oracular input model where the input state is prepared via a
quantum oracle that outputs a purified version of the state, assumed to be
non-singular. Our method outputs an estimate of the $\alpha$-Renyi entropy to
additive precision $\epsilon$, using an expected total number
$O\left(\frac{1}{(x\epsilon)^2}\right)$ of independent applications of a
quantum circuit which coherently queries the input unitary
$O\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\log \frac{d}{\epsilon}\right)$ times, in each case
measuring a single output qubit. Here $\delta$ is a lower cutoff on the

The expected number of measurements made in this method can be compared to
results in the sample complexity model that generally require
$\Theta(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ samples. Furthermore, we also show that multiplicative

deep models so that they are well-approximated by processes that humans can
step-through in little time. Specifically, we train several families of deep
neural networks to resemble compact, axis-aligned decision trees without
significant compromises in accuracy. The resulting axis-aligned decision
functions uniquely make tree regularized models easy for humans to interpret.
Moreover, for situations in which a single, global tree is a poor estimator, we
introduce a regional tree regularizer that encourages the deep model to
resemble a compact, axis-aligned decision tree in predefined,
human-interpretable contexts. Using intuitive toy examples as well as medical
tasks for patients in critical care and with HIV, we demonstrate that this new
family of tree regularizers yield models that are easier for humans to simulate
than simpler L1 or L2 penalties without sacrificing predictive power.

allowed to increase with the sample size, $n$. First, we find that often in

environments, and reward functions may be hard to specify/model and/or to
compute. Moreover, the transfer of policies learned in a simulator to the
real-world has limitations (reality gap). On the other hand, machine learning
methods that rely on the transfer of human knowledge to an agent have shown to
be time efficient for obtaining well performing policies and do not require a
reward function. In this context, we analyze the use of human corrective
feedback during task execution to learn policies with high-dimensional state
spaces, by using the D-COACH framework, and we propose new variants of this
framework. D-COACH is a Deep Learning based extension of COACH (COrrective
Advice Communicated by Humans), where humans are able to shape policies through
corrective advice. The enhanced version of D-COACH, which is proposed in this
paper, largely reduces the time and effort of a human for training a policy.
Experimental results validate the efficiency of the D-COACH framework in three
different problems (simulated and with real robots), and show that its enhanced

to learn policies within periods of time in which a DRL agent do not reach any

overfitting. Importantly, by joint base-novel class training, our approach can

closures and, in extreme cases, area quarantines or cordons sanitaires - are
among the most widely used measures to control infectious diseases.
Restrictions of this kind were important in the response to epidemics of SARS
(2003), H1N1 influenza (2009), and Ebola (2014). However, they do not always
work as expected. The imposition of a cordon sanitaire to control the 2014 West
African Ebola outbreak, for example, is argued to have led to a
higher-than-expected number of cases in the quarantined area. To determine when
mobility restrictions reduce the size of an epidemic, we use a model of disease
transmission within and between economically heterogeneous locally connected
communities. One community comprises a low-risk, resource-rich, low-density
population with access to effective medical resources. The other comprises a
high-risk, resource-poor, high-density population without access to effective
medical resources. We find that the overall size of an epidemic centered in the
high-risk community is sensitive to the stringency of mobility restrictions
between the two communities. Unrestricted mobility between the two risk
communities increases the number of secondary cases in the low-risk community
but reduces the overall epidemic size. By contrast, the imposition of a cordon
sanitaire around the high-risk community reduces the number of secondary
infections in the low-risk community but increases the overall epidemic size.
The degree to which mobility restrictions increase or decrease the overall
epidemic size depends on the level of risk in each community and the
characteristics of the disease.

In this study, we consider fast magneto-acoustic shock wave formation and
propagation in a stratified medium, that is permeated by a horizontal magnetic
field, with properties similar to that of the solar chromosphere. The evolution
of plasma and neutrals is modeled using a two-fluid code that evolves a set of
coupled equations for two separate fluids. We observed that waves in neutrals
and plasma, initially coupled at the upper photosphere, become uncoupled at
higher heights in the chromosphere. This decoupling can be a consequence of
either the characteristic spatial scale at the shock front, that becomes
similar to the collisional scale, or the change in the relation between the
wave frequency, ion cyclotron frequency, and the collisional frequency with
height. The decoupling height is a sensitive function of the wave frequency,
wave amplitude, and the magnetic field strength. We observed that decoupling
causes damping of waves and an increase in the background temperature due to
the frictional heating. The comparison between analytical and numerical results

collisions can provide information about the mechanism of jet-quenching by the
hot and dense QCD matter created in such collisions, the quark-gluon plasma.
This paper presents a measurement of the angular distribution of charged
particles around the jet axis in $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and
$pp$ collisions, using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The Pb+Pb and $pp$ data
sets have integrated luminosities of 0.49 nb$^{-1}$ and 25 pb$^{-1}$,
respectively. The measurement is performed for jets reconstructed with the
anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm with radius parameter $R = 0.4$ and is extended to an
angular distance of $r= 0.8$ from the jet axis. Results are presented as a
function of Pb+Pb collision centrality and distance from the jet axis for
charged particles with transverse momenta in the 1$-$63 GeV range, matched to
jets with transverse momenta in the 126$-$316 GeV range and an absolute value
of jet rapidity of less than 1.7. Modifications to the measured distributions
are quantified by taking a ratio to the measurements in $pp$ collisions. Yields
of charged particles with transverse momenta below 4 GeV are observed to be
increasingly enhanced as a function of angular distance from the jet axis,
reaching a maximum at $r=0.6$. Charged particles with transverse momenta above
4 GeV have an enhanced yield in Pb+Pb collisions in the jet core for angular
distances up to $r = 0.05$ from the jet axis, with a suppression at larger
distances.

  Heterogeneity",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transfer learning methods for reinforcement learning (RL) domains facilitate
the acquisition of new skills using previously acquired knowledge. The vast
majority of existing approaches assume that the agents have the same design,
e.g. same shape and action spaces. In this paper we address the problem of
transferring previously acquired skills amongst morphologically different
agents (MDAs). For instance, assuming that a bipedal agent has been trained to
move forward, could this skill be transferred on to a one-leg hopper so as to
make its training process for the same task more sample efficient? We frame
this problem as one of subspace learning whereby we aim to infer latent factors
representing the control mechanism that is common between MDAs. We propose a
novel paired variational encoder-decoder model, PVED, that disentangles the
control of MDAs into shared and agent-specific factors. The shared factors are
then leveraged for skill transfer using RL. Theoretically, we derive a theorem
indicating how the performance of PVED depends on the shared factors and agent
morphologies. Experimentally, PVED has been extensively validated on four
MuJoCo environments. We demonstrate its performance compared to a
state-of-the-art approach and several ablation cases, visualize and interpret
the hidden factors, and identify avenues for future improvements.

consequence is that there is a universal bound on the sum of basic Betti

isomorphism testing that works by iteratively computing an

  We prove that the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm implicitly

obtain insights about the connectivity of constituent graphs of association

gas kinematics to large samples of high-redshift galaxies. Relative to most
nearby, thin disk galaxies, in which gas rotation accurately traces the
gravitational potential, the interstellar medium (ISM) of z>1 galaxies is
typically more dynamic and exhibits elevated turbulence. If not properly
modeled, these effects can strongly bias dynamical mass measurements. We use
high-resolution FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations to analyze the physical
effects that must be considered to correctly infer dynamical masses from gas
kinematics. Our analysis covers a range of galaxy properties from low-redshift
Milky-Way-mass galaxies to massive high-redshift galaxies (M_* > 10^11 M_sun at
z=1). Selecting only snapshots where a disk is present, we calculate the
rotational profile v_phi(r) of the cool (10^3.5 K < T < 10^4.5 K) gas and
compare it to the circular velocity v_c=sqrt(GM/r). In the simulated galaxies,
the gas rotation traces the circular velocity at intermediate radii, but the
two quantities diverge significantly in the center and in the outer disk. Our
simulations appear to over-predict observed rotational velocities in the
centers of massive galaxies (likely from a lack of black hole feedback), so we
focus on larger radii. Gradients in the turbulent pressure at these radii can
provide additional radial support and bias dynamical mass measurements low by
up to 40%. In both the interior and exterior, the gas' motion can be
significantly non-circular due to e.g. bars, satellites, and inflows/outflows.
We discuss the accuracy of commonly-used analytic models for pressure gradients

paired with early-type neighbors do not undergo the SF enhancement. Here we
revisit the influence of neighbors using a large sample of paired galaxies from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and a carefully constructed control sample of
isolated counterparts. We find that star-forming neighbors enhance SF, and even
more so for more star-forming (and closer) neighbors, which can be attributed
to collisions of interstellar medium (ISM) leading to SF. We further find that,
contrary to the anticipated tidal effect, quiescent neighbors quench SF, and
even more so for more quiescent (and closer) neighbors. This seems to be due to
removal of gas reservoirs via ram pressure stripping and gas accretion cutoff
by hot gas halos of quiescent neighbors, on top of their paucity of ISM to
collide to form stars. Our findings, especially the intimate connection of SF
to the status and strength of neighbors' SF, imply that the hydrodynamic
mechanisms, along with the tidal effect, play a crucial role during the early

Filoche and S. Mayboroda [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109, 14761 (2012)] for the
single-particle Schrodinger operator, to a wide class of interacting many-body
Hamiltonians. The many-body localization landscape (MBLL) is defined on a graph
in the Fock space, whose nodes represent the basis vectors in the Fock space
and edges correspond to transitions between the nodes connected by the hopping
term in the Hamiltonian. It is shown that in analogy to the single-particle
case, the inverse MBLL plays the role of an effective potential in the Fock
space. We construct a generalized discrete Agmon metric and prove Agmon
inequalities and locality theorems on the Fock-state graph to obtain bounds on
the exponential decay of the many-body wave-functions in the Fock space. Using
the MBLL and the locator expansion, we provide considerable analytical evidence
for the existence of many-body localization for a wide-class of lattice models
in any physical dimension for at least a part of their Hilbert space. The key
to this argument is the observation that in sharp contrast to the conventional
locator expansion for the Green's function, the locator expansion for the
landscape function contains no resonances. For short-range hopping, which
limits the connectivity of the Fock-state graph, the locator series is proven
to be convergent and bounded by a simple geometric series. This, in combination
with the Agmon inequalities and locality theorems, indicates that localization
should survive weak interactions and weak hopping for a subset of states in the
Hilbert space, but cannot prove or rule out localization of the other states.
We also qualitatively discuss potential breakdown of the locator expansion in
the MBLL for long-range hopping and the appearance of a mobility edge in
higher-dimensional theories.

monopole-anti-monopole pair of magnetic charge $\pm Q$ separated by a distance
$s$ in a periodic $L^3$ lattice, and study the low-lying eigenvalues of
different lattice Dirac operators under a continuum limit defined by taking
$L\to\infty$ at fixed $s/L$. As the background gauge field is parity even, we
look for a two-fold degeneracy of the Dirac spectrum that is expected of a
continuum-like Dirac operator. The naive-Dirac operator exhibits such a
parity-doubling, but breaks the degeneracy of the fermion-doubler modes for the
$Q$ lowest eigenvalues in the continuum limit. The Wilson-Dirac operator lifts
the fermion-doublers but breaks the parity-doubling in the $Q$ lowest modes
even in the continuum limit. The overlap-Dirac operator shows parity-doubling
of all the modes even at finite $L$ that is devoid of fermion-doubling, and
singles out as a properly regulated continuum Dirac operator in the presence of

a classification tool in particle physics searches. In the presence of
invisible final state particles, the traditional MEM typically assigns
probabilities to an event -- based on whether it is more signal or
background-like -- through a phase space integration over all degrees of
freedom of the invisible particles in the process(es). One inherent shortcoming
of the traditional MEM is that the phase space integration can be slow, and
therefore impractical for high multiplicity final states and/or large data
sets. The recent alternative of matrix-element maximisation has recently been
introduced to circumvent this problem, since maximising a highly-dimensional
function can be a far more CPU-efficient task than that of integration. In this
work, matrix-element maximisation is applied to the process of fully-leptonic
top associated Higgs production, where the Higgs boson decays to two
$b$-quarks. A variety of optimisation algorithms are tested in terms of their
performance and speed, and it is explicitly found that the maximisation
technique is far more CPU-efficient than the traditional MEM at the cost of a
slight reduction in performance. An interesting consequence of using
matrix-element maximisation is that the result of the procedure gives an
estimate of the four-momenta for the invisible particles in the event. As a
result, the idea of using these estimates as input information for more
complicated tools is discussed with potential prospects for future developments
of the method.

combine base learners. In stacking with the weighted average, ensembles are
created from weighted averages of multiple base learners. It is known that
tuning hyperparameters of each base learner inside the ensemble weight
optimization process can produce better performing ensembles. To this end, an
optimization-based nested algorithm that considers tuning hyperparameters as
well as finding the optimal weights to combine ensembles (Generalized Weighted

that of a de Sitter space, and therefore motivates us to look for
time-dependent backgrounds. Finding such backgrounds in string theory has
always been a challenging problem. An even harder problem is to find
time-dependent backgrounds that allow positive dark energies. As a first step
to handle such scenarios, we study a time-dependent background in type IIB
theory, with four-dimensional de Sitter isometries, by uplifting it to M-theory
and then realizing it as a coherent, or squeezed-coherent, state over an
appropriate solitonic configuration. While classically such a background does
not solve the equations of motion, the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equations
reveal that there are deeper issues that may even prohibit a solution to exist
at the quantum level, as long as the internal space remains time-independent. A
more generic analysis is then called for, where both the effective
four-dimensional space-time, the internal space, and the background fluxes are
all time-dependent. We study in details such a background by including
perturbative and non-perturbative as well as local and non-local quantum terms.
Our analysis reveals a distinct possibility of the emergence of a
four-dimensional positive curvature space-time with de Sitter isometries and
time-independent Newton's constant in the landscape of type IIB string theory.
We argue how the no-go and the swampland criteria are avoided in generating
such a background, and compare it with other possibilities involving
backgrounds with time-dependent Newton constants. These time-varying Newton
constant backgrounds typically lead to unavoidable late time singularities,
amongst other issues.

theories (CFTs) under a Floquet drive with the sine-square deformed (SSD)

a heating phase. Here we analytically establish several robust and
`super-universal' features of the heating phase which rely on conformal
invariance but not on the details of the CFT involved. First, we show the
energy density is concentrated in two peaks in real space, a chiral and
anti-chiral peak, which leads to an exponential growth in the total energy. The
peak locations are set by fixed points of the M\""obius transformation. Second,
all of the quantum entanglement is shared between these two peaks. In each
driving period, a number of Bell pairs are generated, with one member pumped to
the chiral peak, and the other member pumped to the anti-chiral peak. These
Bell pairs are localized and accumulate at these two peaks, and can serve as a
source of quantum entanglement. Third, in both the heating and non-heating
phases we find that the total energy is related to the half system entanglement
entropy by a simple relation $E(t)\propto c \exp \left( \frac{6}{c}S(t)
\right)$ with $c$ being the central charge. In addition, we show that the
non-heating phase, in which the energy and entanglement oscillate in time, is
unstable to small fluctuations of the driving frequency in contrast to the
heating phase. Finally, we point out an analogy to the periodically driven
harmonic oscillator which allows us to understand global features of the
phases, and introduce a quasiparticle picture to explain the spatial structure,
which can be generalized to setups beyond the SSD construction.

some critical angle ($\beta_{max}=63.4$ degress for $\gamma=5/3$ and

evolution of the universe from the Cosmic Dawn to the Epoch of Reionization.
These measurements are challenged by the presence of bright foreground emission
that can be separated from the cosmological signal if its spectrum is smooth.
This assumption fails in the case of single polarization antennas as they
measure linearly polarized foreground emission - which is inevitably Faraday
rotated through the interstellar medium. We investigate the impact of Galactic
polarized foregrounds on the extraction of the global 21~cm signal through
realistic sky and dipole simulations both in a low frequency band from $50$ to
$100$~MHz, where a 21~cm absorption profile is expected, and in a higher
frequency band ($100-200$~MHz). We find that the presence of a polarized
contaminant with complex frequency structure can bias the amplitude and the
shape of the reconstructed signal parameters in both bands. We investigate if
polarized foregrounds can explain the unexpected $21$~cm Cosmic Dawn signal
recently reported by the EDGES collaboration. We find that unaccounted
polarized foreground contamination can produce an enhanced and distorted
$21$~cm absorption trough similar to the anomalous profile reported by Bowman
et al. (2018), and whose amplitude is in mild tension with the assumed input
Gaussian profile (at $\sim 1.5 \sigma$ level). Moreover, we note that, under
the hypothesis of contamination from polarized foreground, the amplitude of the
reconstructed EDGES signal can be overestimated by around $30\%$, mitigating
the requirement for an explanation based on exotic physics.

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over seven redshift bins up to $z=2.15$

where radio-quiet quasars emerge coincides with the luminosity where
star-forming galaxies are expected to start to dominate the radio source

formation in the host galaxies, but additional data is required to investigate

the DFU as well as tissue classification. According to DFU medical
classification systems, the presence of infection (bacteria in the wound) and
ischaemia (inadequate blood supply) has important clinical implications for DFU
assessment, which are used to predict the risk of amputation. In this work, we
propose a new dataset and computer vision techniques to identify the presence
of infection and ischaemia in DFU. This is the first time a DFU dataset with
ground truth labels of ischaemia and infection cases is introduced for research
purposes. For the handcrafted machine learning approach, we propose a new
feature descriptor, namely the Superpixel Color Descriptor. Then we use the
Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for more effective
recognition of ischaemia and infection. We propose to use a natural
data-augmentation method, which identifies the region of interest on foot
images and focuses on finding the salient features existing in this area.
Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed techniques on binary
classification, i.e. ischaemia versus non-ischaemia and infection versus
non-infection. Overall, our method performed better in the classification of
ischaemia than infection. We found that our proposed Ensemble CNN deep learning
algorithms performed better for both classification tasks as compared to
handcrafted machine learning algorithms, with 90% accuracy in ischaemia
classification and 73% in infection classification.

\bar b$ pair observables are discussed to determine which are most likely to
provide insights about the system and why. Methods: The calculations, employing
the exclusive HVQMNR code, assume the same intrinsic $k_T$-broadening and
fragmentation as in [R. Vogt, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 98} (2018) 034907]. The pair
distributions presented by LHCb are calculated in this approach, both for the
parent $b \bar b$ and the $J/\psi J/\psi$ pairs produced in their decay. The
sensitivity of the results to the intrinsic $k_T$ broadening is shown. The
theoretical uncertainties due to the $b$ quark mass and scale variations on
both the initial $b \bar b$ pairs and the resulting $J/\psi$ pairs are also
shown. Possible effects due to the presence of the nucleus are studied by
increasing the size of the $k_T$ broadening and modification of the
fragmentation parameter. Results: Good agreement with the LHCb data is found
for all observables. The parent $b \bar b$ distributions are more sensitive to
the $k_T$ broadening than are the final-state $J/\psi$ pairs. Conclusions:
Next-to-leading order calculations with $k_T$ broadening, as in [R. Vogt, Phys.
Rev. C {\bf 98} (2018) 034907], can describe all correlated observables.
Multiple measurements of correlated observables are sensitive to different
nuclear effects which can help distinguish between them.

toward the study of population systems. The driving force behind this shift was
geared by numerous emerging and ever-changing technologies in life and physical
sciences and engineering, from neuroscience, biology, and quantum physics to
robotics, where many control-enabled applications involve manipulating a large
ensemble of structurally identical dynamic units, or agents. Analyzing
fundamental properties of ensemble control systems in turn plays a foundational
and critical role in enabling and, further, advancing these applications, and
the analysis is largely beyond the capability of classical control techniques.
In this paper, we consider an ensemble of time-invariant linear systems
evolving on an infinite-dimensional space of continuous functions. We exploit
the notion of separating points and techniques of polynomial approximation to
develop necessary and sufficient ensemble controllability conditions. In
particular, we introduce an extended notion of controllability matrix, called
Ensemble Controllability Gramian. This means enables the characterization of
ensemble controllability through evaluating controllability of each individual
system in the ensemble. As a result, the work provides a unified framework with
a systematic procedure for analyzing control systems defined on an
infinite-dimensional space by a finite-dimensional approach.

analyses of the velocity gradient tensor (VGT) show that the density variations
significantly change the turbulence structure and flow topology. Specifically,
a stronger symmetrization of the joint probability density function (PDF) of

perturbers. It is the most straightforward technique to observe planetary
systems as a whole. Aims. We present the first resolved images of the debris
disc around the young F-type star HD 160305, detected in scattered light using
the VLT/SPHERE instrument in the near infrared. Methods. We used a
post-processing method based on angular differential imaging and synthetic
images of debris discs produced with a disc modelling code (GRaTer) to
constrain the main characteristics of the disc around HD 160305. All of the
point sources in the field of the IRDIS camera were analysed with an
astrometric tool to determine whether they are bound objects or background
stars. Results. We detect a very inclined (~ 82{\deg}) ring-like debris disc
located at a stellocentric distance of about 86au (deprojected width ~27 au).
The disc displays a brightness asymmetry between the two sides of the major
axis, as can be expected from scattering properties of dust grains. We derive
an anisotropic scattering factor g>0.5. A second right-left asymmetry is also
observed with respect to the minor axis. We measure a surface brightness ratio
of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.18 between the bright and the faint sides. Because of the low
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the images we cannot easily discriminate between
several possible explanations for this left-right asymmetry, such as
perturbations by an unseen planet, the aftermath of the breakup of a massive
planetesimal, or the pericenter glow effect due to an eccentric ring. Two
epochs of observations allow us to reject the companionship hypothesis for the
15 point sources present in the field.

logistic functions to the longitudinal dynamics of biomarkers as functions of
the DPS using M-estimation. Robustness of the estimates is quantified using
bootstrapping via Monte Carlo resampling, and the estimated inflection points

relative importance of each seasonality and addresses the interactions between
them. The model is implemented with Stan, a probabilistic language, and was
compared with three existing models on a real-world dataset of pallet transport
from a logistic network. Our new model achieved considerable improvements in

exposure concentrations. The model we present can incorporate additional

local image features as well as on features of neighboring vertices in the mesh
graph. The method was trained and evaluated using the publicly available
Coronary Artery Stenoses Detection and Quantification Evaluation Framework.
Surface meshes enclosing the full coronary artery tree were automatically
extracted. A quantitative evaluation on 78 coronary artery segments showed that
these meshes corresponded closely to reference annotations, with a Dice
similarity coefficient of 0.75/0.73, a mean surface distance of 0.25/0.28 mm,
and a Hausdorff distance of 1.53/1.86 mm in healthy/diseased vessel segments.
The results showed that inclusion of mesh information in a GCN improves
segmentation overlap and accuracy over a baseline model without interaction on
the mesh. The results indicate that GCNs allow efficient extraction of coronary
artery surface meshes and that the use of GCNs leads to regular and more
accurate meshes.

Remarkably, a proposed all-photonic quantum repeater avoids the need for
quantum memory by harnessing the graph states in the repeater nodes. Here we
perform an experimental demonstration of an all-photonic quantum repeater using
linear optics. By manipulating a 12-photon interferometer, we implement a
2-by-2 parallel all-photonic quantum repeater, and observe an 89% enhancement
of entanglement-generation rate over the standard parallel entanglement
swapping. These results open a new way towards designing repeaters with

matter-memory-based schemes -- towards realizing practical quantum repeaters.

  asymptotics and double descent curve","We reorganized the proofs of the main theorem",,,,"math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning methods operate in regimes that defy the traditional
statistical mindset. Neural network architectures often contain more parameters
than training samples, and are so rich that they can interpolate the observed
labels, even if the latter are replaced by pure noise. Despite their huge
complexity, the same architectures achieve small generalization error on real
data.
  This phenomenon has been rationalized in terms of a so-called `double
descent' curve. As the model complexity increases, the test error follows the
usual U-shaped curve at the beginning, first decreasing and then peaking around
the interpolation threshold (when the model achieves vanishing training error).
However, it descends again as model complexity exceeds this threshold. The
global minimum of the test error is found above the interpolation threshold,
often in the extreme overparametrization regime in which the number of
parameters is much larger than the number of samples. Far from being a peculiar
property of deep neural networks, elements of this behavior have been
demonstrated in much simpler settings, including linear regression with random
covariates.
  In this paper we consider the problem of learning an unknown function over
the $d$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb S^{d-1}$, from $n$ i.i.d. samples
$(\boldsymbol x_i, y_i)\in \mathbb S^{d-1} \times \mathbb R$, $i\le n$. We
perform ridge regression on $N$ random features of the form $\sigma(\boldsymbol
w_a^{\mathsf T} \boldsymbol x)$, $a\le N$. This can be equivalently described
as a two-layers neural network with random first-layer weights. We compute the
precise asymptotics of the test error, in the limit $N,n,d\to \infty$ with
$N/d$ and $n/d$ fixed. This provides the first analytically tractable model
that captures all the features of the double descent phenomenon without
assuming ad hoc misspecification structures.

velocity dispersion, must follow a steep log scale slope of -0.015 dex/kpc as a
function of impact parameter out to at least 20-30 kpc. We then compile an
archival data and literature based sample of galaxies seen in both emission and
absorption suitable for the test, and find that current data confirm the
hypothesis out to 40-60 kpc. In addition we show that the distribution of the
velocity offsets between z em and z abs favours a model where DLA systems are
composed of individual sub-clouds distributed along the entire path through the
halo, and disfavours a model where they are one single cloud with a bulk motion
and internal sub-structure.

line velocity widths ($\Delta v_{90}$) are known to scale with host galaxy

with the emission-line widths of the host galaxies, $\sigma_{em}$, so that
absorbers with a range of $\Delta v_{90}$ values can be compared directly.
Using a sample of DLA systems at 0.2 < z < 3.2 with spectroscopically confirmed

decreases with projected distances from the hosts. We compare the data with
expectations of line-of-sight velocity dispersions derived for different dark

to sign and verify depends on the chosen pairing curve. There are many
applications in which the signature size is of more importance than the
performance and similarly other applications where the performance is of more
importance than signature size. In this work, we describe the popular signature

prove that under proper conditions on the network weights, our proposed
empirical risk, despite non-convexity, has no stationary point outside of small
neighborhoods around the true representation $x_0$ and its negative multiple;
furthermore, we show that the global minimizer of the empirical risk stays

efficient, high-energy leptonic acceleration. Fermi-LAT observations show that
the density of GeV leptons in the TeV nebula is lower than predicted by single

However, the energy gap between Fermi-LAT and HAWC (~500 GeV to ~1 TeV) remains
under-examined. The VERITAS gamma-ray observatory is sensitive in the energy
range from 100 GeV to greater than 30 TeV, filling the gap between Fermi-LAT

dissipative. In this paper we propose an energy-efficient learning framework
that exploits structural and functional similarities between a machine learning
network and a general electrical network satisfying the Tellegen's theorem. In
contrast to the standard energy-based models, the proposed formulation
associates two energy components, namely, active and reactive energy to the
network. This ensures that the network's active-power is dissipated only during
the process of learning, whereas the reactive-power is maintained to be zero at
all times. As a result, in steady-state, the learned parameters are stored and
self-sustained by electrical resonance determined by the network's nodal
inductances and capacitances. Based on this approach, this paper introduces
three novel concepts: (a) A learning framework where the network's active-power
dissipation is used as a regularization for a learning objective function that
is subjected to zero total reactive-power constraint; (b) A dynamical system
based on complex-domain, continuous-time growth transforms which optimizes the
learning objective function and drives the network towards electrical resonance
under steady-state operation; and (c) An annealing procedure that controls the
trade-off between active-power dissipation and the speed of convergence. As a
representative example, we show how the proposed framework can be used for
designing resonant support vector machines (SVMs), where we show that the
support-vectors correspond to an LC network with self-sustained oscillations.

forbidden moves. In this paper we discuss Gordian complex of knots by region
crossing change and Gordian complex of virtual knots by arc shift move. Arc
shift move is a local move in the virtual knot diagram which results in
reversing orientation locally between two consecutive crossings. We show the
existence of an arbitrarily high dimensional simplex in both the Gordian
complexes, i.e., by region crossing change and by the arc shift move. For any
given knot (respectively, virtual knot) diagram we construct an infinite family
of knots (respectively, virtual knots) such that any two distinct members of
the family have distance one by region crossing change (respectively, arc shift
move). We show that that the constructed virtual knots have the same affine

weights might improve quality of the final solution. A set of uniformly
distributed weights usually leads to well-distributed solutions on a Pareto
front. However, there are two main difficulties with this approach. Firstly, it
may fail depending on the problem geometry. Secondly, the population size
becomes not flexible as the number of objectives increases. In this paper, we
propose the MOEA/D with Uniformly Randomly Adaptive Weights (MOEA/DURAW) which
uses the Uniformly Randomly method as an approach to subproblems generation,
allowing a flexible population size even when working with many objective
problems. During the evolutionary process, MOEA/D-URAW adds and removes
subproblems as a function of the sparsity level of the population. Moreover,
instead of requiring assumptions about the Pareto front shape, our method
adapts its weights to the shape of the problem during the evolutionary process.
Experimental results using WFG41-48 problem classes, with different Pareto
front shapes, shows that the present method presents better or equal results in
77.5% of the problems evaluated from 2 to 6 objectives when compared with
state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

approach to the two-fermion response function truncated on the two-body level
by the cluster expansion of the dynamical interaction kernel to the approach
known as time blocking approximation. Such a comparison leads to an extended
many-body theory with non-perturbative treatment of high-order configurations.
The present implementation of the advanced theory introduces a new class of
solutions for the response functions, which include explicitly
beyond-mean-field correlations between up to six fermions. The novel approach,
which includes configurations with two quasiparticles coupled to two phonons
(2q$\otimes$2phonon), is discussed in detail for the particle-hole nuclear
response and applied to medium-mass nuclei. The proposed developments are
implemented numerically on the basis of the relativistic effective
meson-nucleon Lagrangian and compared to the models confined by two-fermion and
four-fermion configurations, which are considered as state-of-the-art for the
response theory in nuclear structure calculations. The results obtained for the

edge of the network, where data is typically generated and collected, by
exploiting multiple devices at the edge collectively. However, offloading tasks
to other devices leaves the edge computing applications at the complete mercy
of an attacker. One of the attacks, which is also the focus of this work, is
Byzantine attacks, where one or more devices can corrupt the offloaded tasks.
Furthermore, exploiting the potential of edge computing is challenging mainly
due to the heterogeneous and time-varying nature of the devices at the edge. In
this paper, we develop a secure coded cooperative computation mechanism (SC3)
that provides both security and computation efficiency guarantees by gracefully
combining homomorphic hash functions and coded cooperative computation.
Homomorphic hash functions are used against Byzantine attacks and coded
cooperative computation is used to improve computation efficiency when edge
resources are heterogeneous and time-varying. Simulations results show that SC3
improves task completion delay significantly.

simulating a random variable $X$ which has mean $\mu$ equal to the target
answer, and a relative standard deviation bounded above by a known constant
$c$. Examples of this type of algorithm includes methods for approximating the
number of satisfying assignments to 2-SAT or DNF, the volume of a convex body,
and the partition function of a Gibbs distribution. Because the answer is
usually exponentially large in the problem input size, it is typical to require
an estimate $\hat \mu$ satisfy $\mathbb{P}(|\hat \mu/\mu - 1| > \epsilon) \leq
\delta$, where $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ are user specified nonnegative
parameters. The current best algorithm uses $\lceil
2c^2\epsilon^{-2}(1+\epsilon)^2 \ln(2/\delta) \rceil$ samples to achieve such
an estimate. By modifying the algorithm in order to balance the tails, it is
possible to improve this result to $\lceil 2(c^2\epsilon^{-2} +
1)/(1-\epsilon^2)\ln(2/\delta) \rceil$ samples. Aside from the theoretical
improvement, we also consider how to best implement this algorithm in practice.
Numerical experiments show the behavior of the estimator on distributions where

two decades. Objective: This study aims to perform a comprehensive systematic
mapping study of existing empirical studies on evaluation of the effect of
object-oriented code refactoring activities on software quality attributes.
Method: We followed a multi-stage scrutinizing process to select 142 primary
studies published till December 2017. The selected primary studies were further
classified based on several aspects to answer the research questions defined
for this work. In addition, we applied vote-counting approach to combine the
empirical results and their analysis reported in primary studies. Results: The
findings indicate that studies conducted in academic settings found more
positive impact of refactoring on software quality than studies performed in
industries. In general, refactoring activities caused all quality attributes to
improve or degrade except for cohesion, complexity, inheritance,
fault-proneness and power consumption attributes. Furthermore, individual
refactoring activities have variable effects on most quality attributes
explored in primary studies, indicating that refactoring does not always
improve all quality attributes. Conclusions: This study points out several open
issues which require further investigation, e.g., lack of industrial
validation, lesser coverage of refactoring activities, limited tool support,

focused on materials where thermal conductivity $\kappa$ is dominated by
acoustic phonons, and the impact of four phonon scattering, although
significant, is still generally smaller than three-phonon scattering. In this
work, taking AlSb as example, we demonstrated that four-phonon scattering is
even more critical to three-phonon scattering as it diminishes optical phonon
thermal transport, and therefore significantly reduces the thermal
conductivities of materials in which optical branches have long three-phonon
lifetimes. Also, our calculations show that four-phonon scattering can play an
extremely important role in weakening the isotope effect on $\kappa$.
Specifically, four-phonon scattering reduces the room-temperature $\kappa$ of

properties may lead to catastrophes. We propose a method to enforce the safety
of systems with real-valued signals by synthesizing a runtime enforcer called
the shield. Whenever the system violates a property, the shield, composed with
the system, makes correction instantaneously to ensure that no erroneous output
is generated by the combined system. While techniques for synthesizing Boolean
shields are well understood, they do not handle real-valued signals ubiquitous
in cyber-physical systems, meaning corrections may be either unrealizable or
inefficient to compute in the real domain. We solve the realizability and
efficiency problems by statically analyzing the compatibility of predicates
defined over real-valued signals, and using the analysis result to constrain a
two-player safety game used to synthesize the shield. We have implemented the
method and demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency on a variety of
applications, including an automotive powertrain control system.

cross-lingual image captioning problem through a pivot language, which is with
the help of paired image-caption data in the pivot language and pivot-to-target
machine translation models. However, such language-pivoted approach suffers
from inaccuracy brought by the pivot-to-target translation, including
disfluency and visual irrelevancy errors. In this paper, we propose to generate
cross-lingual image captions with self-supervised rewards in the reinforcement
learning framework to alleviate these two types of errors. We employ
self-supervision from mono-lingual corpus in the target language to provide
fluency reward, and propose a multi-level visual semantic matching model to
provide both sentence-level and concept-level visual relevancy rewards. We
conduct extensive experiments for unpaired cross-lingual image captioning in
both English and Chinese respectively on two widely used image caption corpora.
The proposed approach achieves significant performance improvement over

challenge in extending these methods to three dimensions, however, is
representation of field values. Whereas cross fields can be represented by
tangent vector fields that form a linear space, the 3D analog---an octahedral
frame field---takes values in a nonlinear manifold. In this work, we describe
the space of octahedral frames in the language of differential and algebraic

optimization of octahedral fields, namely geodesic stepping and exact
projection via semidefinite relaxation. Our algebraic approach not only
provides an elegant and mathematically-sound description of the space of
octahedral frames but also suggests a generalization to frames whose three axes
scale independently, better capturing the singular behavior we expect to see in
volumetric frame fields. These new odeco frames, so-called as they are
represented by orthogonally decomposable tensors, also admit a semidefinite
program--based projection operator. Our description of the spaces of octahedral

optimization algorithms; we show that these algorithms efficiently produce
high-quality fields while maintaining stability and smoothness.

the typical attributes of a medium of exchange. Consequently, cryptocurrencies
are more appropriately described as crypto assets. A common investment
attribute shared by the more than 2,500 crypto assets is that they are highly
volatile. An investor interested in reducing price volatility of a portfolio of
crypto assets can do so by constructing an optimal portfolio through standard
optimization techniques that minimize tail risk. Because crypto assets are not
backed by any real assets, forming a hedge to reduce the risk contribution of a
single crypto asset can only be done with another set of similar assets (i.e.,
a set of other crypto assets). A major finding of this paper is that crypto
portfolios constructed via optimizations that minimize variance and Conditional
Value at Risk outperform a major stock market index (the S$\&$P 500). As of
this writing, options in which the underlying is a crypto asset index are not
traded, one of the reasons being that the academic literature has not
formulated an acceptable fair pricing model. We offer a fair valuation model
for crypto asset options based on a dynamic pricing model for the underlying
crypto assets. The model was carefully backtested and therefore offers a
reliable model for the underlying crypto assets in the natural world. We then
obtain the valuation of crypto options by passing the natural world to the
equivalent martingale measure via the Esscher transform. Because of the absence
of traded crypto options we could not compare the prices obtained from our
valuation model to market prices. Yet, we can claim that if such options on
crypto assets are introduced, they should follow closely our theoretical prices
after adjusting for market frictions and design feature nuances.

surveyed. Two-point correlations, involving space-time correlations, two-point

\alpha\neq0,$ is impossible even though the real-valued function $\varphi$
enjoys the full spark property (so does $e^{\textbf{i}\alpha \cdot}\varphi$).
Stated another way, the PLS in the complex-generated SISs is essentially
different from that in the real-generated ones. Motivated by this, we first
establish the condition on the complex-valued generator $\phi$ such that the
PLS of nonseparable causal (NC) signals in $V(\phi)$ can be achieved by random
sampling. The condition is established from the generalized Haar condition
(GHC) perspective. Based on the proposed reconstruction approach, it is proved
that if the GHC holds then with probability $1$, the random sampling density
(SD) $=3$ is sufficient for the PLS of NC signals in the complex-generated
SISs. For the real-valued case we also prove that, if the GHC holds then with
probability $1$, the random SD $=2$ is sufficient for the PLS of real-valued NC
signals in the real-generated SISs. For the local reconstruction of highly
oscillatory signals such as chirps, a great number of deterministic samples are
required. Compared with deterministic sampling, the proposed random approach
enjoys not only the greater sampling flexibility but the much smaller number of
samples. To verify our results, numerical simulations were conducted to
reconstruct highly oscillatory NC signals in the chirp-modulated SISs.

question as most recommendation problems can be naturally formulated as ranking
problems. While much of collaborative ranking methodology assumes static
ranking data, the importance of temporal information to improving ranking
performance is increasingly apparent. Recent advances in deep learning,
especially the discovery of various attention mechanisms and newer
architectures in addition to widely used RNN and CNN in natural language
processing, have allowed us to make better use of the temporal ordering of
items that each user has engaged with. In particular, the SASRec model,
inspired by the popular Transformer model in natural languages processing, has
achieved state-of-art results in the temporal collaborative ranking problem and
enjoyed more than 10x speed-up when compared to earlier CNN/RNN-based methods.
However, SASRec is inherently an un-personalized model and does not include
personalized user embeddings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Personalized Transformer (SSE-PT) model, outperforming SASRec by almost 5% in
terms of NDCG@10 on 5 real-world datasets. Furthermore, after examining some
random users' engagement history and corresponding attention heat maps used
during the inference stage, we find our model is not only more interpretable
but also able to focus on recent engagement patterns for each user. Moreover,
our SSE-PT model with a slight modification, which we call SSE-PT++, can handle
extremely long sequences and outperform SASRec in ranking results with
comparable training speed, striking a balance between performance and speed
requirements. Code and data are open sourced at

pose sequence, has typically been tackled with recurrent neural networks
(RNNs). However, as evidenced by prior work, the resulted RNN models suffer
from prediction errors accumulation, leading to undesired discontinuities in
motion prediction. In this paper, we propose a simple feed-forward deep network
for motion prediction, which takes into account both temporal smoothness and
spatial dependencies among human body joints. In this context, we then propose
to encode temporal information by working in trajectory space, instead of the
traditionally-used pose space. This alleviates us from manually defining the
range of temporal dependencies (or temporal convolutional filter size, as done
in previous work). Moreover, spatial dependency of human pose is encoded by
treating a human pose as a generic graph (rather than a human skeletal
kinematic tree) formed by links between every pair of body joints. Instead of
using a pre-defined graph structure, we design a new graph convolutional
network to learn graph connectivity automatically. This allows the network to
capture long range dependencies beyond that of human kinematic tree. We
evaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets for motion
prediction, including Human3.6M, the CMU motion capture dataset and 3DPW. Our
experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state of
the art performance, and is applicable to both angle-based and position-based
pose representations. The code is available at

exchange of information. This renders CMPs as promising candidates for future
applications such as in information processing. Recent advances on the study of
the CMP now allow not only for creation of CMPs on demand, but also for tuning
of the coupling strength - this can be thought of as enhancing or suppressing

relative phase $\phi$ and amplitude field ratio $\delta_0$ between both ports.
Specifically, we derive a new expression from Input-Output theory for the study

The source monitors a physical process and generates status update packets
according to a Poisson process. The packets are transmitted to the destination
by using finite blocklength coding to update the status (e.g., temperature,
speed, position) of the monitored process. In some applications, such as
real-time monitoring and tracking, the timeliness of the status updates is
critical since the users are interested in the latest condition of the process.
The timeliness of the status updates can be reflected by a recently proposed
metric, termed the age of information (AoI). We focus on the packet management
policies for the considered system. Specifically, the preemption and discard of
status updates are important to decrease the AoI. For example, it is
meaningless to transmit stale status updates when a new status update is
generated. We propose three packet management schemes in the transmission
between the source and the destination, namely non-preemption (NP), preemption
(PR) and retransmission (RT) schemes. We derive closed-form expressions of the
average AoI for the proposed three schemes. Based on the derived analytical
expressions of the average AoI, we further minimize the average AoI by
optimizing the packet blocklength for each status update. Simulation results
are provided to validate our theoretical analysis, which further show that the
proposed schemes can outperform each other for different system setups, and the
proposed schemes considerably outperform the existing ones without packet
management at medium to high generation rate.

skills for any given goals, leading to the fundamental problem of learning the
Universal Value Function Approximator (UVFA). A UVFA learns to predict the
cumulative rewards between all state-goal pairs. However, empirically, the
value function for long-range goals is always hard to estimate and may
consequently result in failed policy. This has presented challenges to the
learning process and the capability of neural networks. We propose a method to
address this issue in large MDPs with sparse rewards, in which exploration and
routing across remote states are both extremely challenging. Our method
explicitly models the environment in a hierarchical manner, with a high-level
dynamic landmark-based map abstracting the visited state space, and a low-level
value network to derive precise local decisions. We use farthest point sampling
to select landmark states from past experience, which has improved exploration
compared with simple uniform sampling. Experimentally we showed that our method
enables the agent to reach long-range goals at the early training stage, and

numerous calibration systems. The charge calibration is carried out with a
Single Photo-Electron peak. The various data acquired during the last three

precisely identify the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the object code

reverse engineering tools must support is ever increasing due to massive
proliferation of IoT devices and the diversity of firmware and malware
targeting those devices. Recent studies concluded that falsely identifying the
binary code's ISA caused alone about 10\% of failures of IoT firmware analysis.
The state of the art approaches to detect ISA for arbitrary object code look
promising - their results demonstrate effectiveness and high-performance.
However, they lack the support of publicly available datasets and toolsets,
which makes the evaluation, comparison, and improvement of those techniques,
datasets, and machine learning models quite challenging (if not impossible).
This paper bridges multiple gaps in the field of automated and precise
identification of architecture and endianness of binary files and object code.
We develop from scratch the toolset and datasets that are lacking in this
research space. As such, we contribute a comprehensive collection of open data,
open source, and open API web-services. We also attempt experiment
reconstruction and cross-validation of effectiveness, efficiency, and results
of the state of the art methods. When training and testing classifiers using
solely code-sections from executable binary files, all our classifiers
performed equally well achieving over 98\% accuracy. The results are consistent

4151 - the only AGN bright enough to be monitored at higher energies with
\textit{Swift} BAT. We develop a spectral-timing model with a hot corona, warm
Comptonisation, and outer standard disc. This fits the time-averaged spectrum
well, but completely fails to match the UV variability predicted from the X-ray
lightcurve. However, it reveals that NGC 4151 had a bolometric luminosity
around $1.4\%$ of the Eddington luminosity during this campaign, close to the
luminosity at which AGN show a `changing-state' transition, where the broad
optical lines disappear. Stellar mass black holes show a state transition at a
similarly low Eddington fraction, which is broadly interpreted as the inner
disc being replaced by an optically thin flow. We find that the UV lightcurve
can instead be matched by reprocessing of the X-ray flux on size scales of the
broad line region (BLR; $1.5-20$ light-days) and rule out there being optically
thick material inwards of this, as expected if the thin disc is replaced by the

mechanisms of turbulence are superseded by the propagation of inertial waves,
as the effects of rotation become dominant. While this mechanism has been
identified experimentally, the conditions of the transition between the two
mechanisms are less clear. We tackle this question experimentally by tracking
the turbulent front away from a solid wall where jets enter an otherwise
quiescent fluid. Without background rotation, this apparatus generates a
turbulent front whose displacement recovers the $z(t)\sim t^{1/2}$ law
classically obtained with an oscillating grid and we further establish the
scale-independence of the associated transport mechanism. When the apparatus is
rotating at a constant velocity perpendicular to the wall where fluid is
injected, not only does the turbulent front become mainly transported by
inertial waves, but advection itself is suppressed because of the local deficit
of momentum incurred by the propagation of these waves. Scale-by-scale analysis
of the displacement of the turbulent front reveals that the transition between
advection and propagation is local both in space and spectrally, and takes
place when the Rossby number based on the considered scale is of unity, or
equivalently, when the scale-dependent group velocity of inertial waves matched
the local advection velocity.

method that combines a knowledge-based approach and a reinforcement learning
(RL) technique into one method for intelligent problem solving. The proposed
approach focuses on multi-expert knowledge acquisition, with the reinforcement
learning being applied as a conflict resolution strategy aimed at integrating
the knowledge of multiple exerts into one knowledge base.
  The article describes the KB-RL approach in detail and applies the reported
method to one of the most challenging problems of current Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research, namely playing a strategy game. The results show
that the KB-RL system is able to play and complete the full FreeCiv game, and
to win against the computer players in various game settings. Moreover, with
more games played, the system improves the gameplay by shortening the number of
rounds that it takes to win the game.
  Overall, the reported experiment supports the idea that, based on human
knowledge and empowered by reinforcement learning, the KB-RL system can deliver
a strong solution to the complex, multi-strategic problems, and, mainly, to
improve the solution with increased experience.

parameters to prevent overfitting effectively. In addition, label
regularization techniques such as label smoothing and label disturbance have
also been proposed with the motivation of adding a stochastic perturbation to

which enables the neural network to learn from the erroneous experience and
update the optimal label representation online. On the other hand, compared
with knowledge distillation, which learns the correlation of categories using

Our benchmark model assumes an exogenous number of bidders N. We show that, if
the bidders observe N, the resulting discontinuities in the winning bid density
can be used to identify the distribution of N. The private value distribution
can be nonparametrically identified in a second step. This extends, under
testable identification conditions, to the case where N is a number of
potential buyers, who bid with some unknown probability. Identification also
holds in presence of additive unobserved heterogeneity drawn from some
parametric distributions. A last class of extensions deals with cartels which
can change size across auctions due to varying bidder cartel membership.
Identification still holds if the econometrician observes winner identities and
winning bids, provided a (unknown) bidder is always a cartel member. The cartel
participation probabilities of other bidders can also be identified. An
application to USFS timber auction data illustrates the usefulness of
discontinuities to analyze bidder participation.

Thereby, the class of model is retained and all possible coarse-graining

class of algebraic models generated by the subsequent and simultaneous
catalytic functions of chemicals within a reaction network. Our ansatz yields
coarse-graining operations that cover the network with local functional patches
and delete the information about the environment, and complementary operations
that resolve only the large-scale functional structure of the network. Finally,
we present a geometric interpretation of the algebraic models through an
analogy with classical models on vector fields. We then use the geometric
framework to show how a coarse-graining of the algebraic model naturally leads
to a coarse-graining of the state-space. The framework developed here is aimed

scales up to 8 marcsec (0.65 pc) from the core (2.5 marcsec in projection).
General analysis of integrals of motion being unaltered along the jet and
reflecting fundamental conservation laws shows that the above dependence
implies a polytropic equation of state with index 4/3. The inferred value of
the polytropic index appears independent of the exact nature of forces
sustaining the transverse balance of the jet and indicates exact conservation
of the longitudinal electric current and hence the existence of a stable
internal electromagnetic structure at the scales under consideration. At this
index the flow is hot and corresponds to relativistic thermodynamic motion of
particles. Considerable weakening of the acceleration efficiency after 8
marcsec with the jet form being unchanged can be related to the plasma cooling,
when the polytropic index becomes 5/3. Such a sharp change in the index without
intermediate delay at 1.44 during cooling favours the existence of an
electron-positron plasma and requires at least partial participation of the

information about the evolution of solar-plage regions for more than a century
and are therefore a unique dataset for solar-activity studies. For a long time
Ca II K observations were barely explored, but recent digitisations of multiple
archives have allowed their extensive analysis. However, various studies have
reported diverse results partly due to the insufficient quality of the
digitised data. Furthermore, inhomogeneities have been identified within the
individual archives, which, at least partly, could be due to the digitisation.
As a result, some of the archives, e.g. that from the Kodaikanal observatory,
were re-digitised. The results obtained by different authors who analysed the
data from the new digitisation of the Kodaikanal archive differ from each other
as well as from those derived from the old digitisation. Since the data were
processed and analysed using different techniques, it is not clear, however,
whether the differences are due to the digitisation or the processing of the
data. To understand the reasons for such discrepancies, we analyse here the
data from the two most recent digitisations of this archive. We use the same
techniques to consistently process the images from both archives and to derive
the plage areas from them. Some issues have been identified in both
digitisations, implying that they are intrinsic characteristics of the data.
Moreover, errors in timing of the observations plague both digitisations.
Overall, the most recent 16-bit digitisation offers an improvement over the
earlier 8-bit one. It also includes considerably more data and should be
preferred.

observations with high temporal resolution as they have the scientific
potential to track the whole dynamics of the system (from small to large
scales), and they constitute the next generation of Mars' exploration as it
happened at Earth few decades ago. This White Paper discusses the key science
questions that are still open at Mars and how they could be addressed with
coordinated multipoint missions. The main science questions are: (i) How does
solar wind driving impact on magnetospheric and ionospheric dynamics? (ii) What
is the structure and nature of the tail of Mars' magnetosphere at all scales?
(iii) How does the lower atmosphere couple to the upper atmosphere? (iv) Why
should we have a permanent in-situ Space Weather monitor at Mars? Each science
question is devoted to a specific plasma region, and includes several specific
scientific objectives to study in the coming decades. In addition, two mission
concepts are also proposed based on coordinated multi-point science from a
constellation of orbiting and ground-based platforms, which focus on

better or comparable performance in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, the

the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) of the multiplet, that is, of
the mixed quantum state that allows all possible spin projections. The mixed
states of maximum spin multiplicity are considered. This approach differs from
the methods routinely used in electronic structure calculations that focus on

intrapair dynamic electron correlation. The missing dynamic correlation is
recovered by the NOF-MP2 method. Calculation of ionization potentials of the
first-row transition-metal atoms is presented as test case. The values obtained

to measure the electron density of the gas unless the electron temperature is
known to be constant. We review the temperature and density distributions
observed within H II regions and discuss the implications of these

contain radial variations in density. We suggest that the ISM pressure is a
more meaningful quantity to measure in H II regions or galaxies. Specific

the state of an ecosystem, that are usually associated with dangerous levels of
environmental change. However, recent studies show that critical transitions
can also be triggered by dangerous rates of environmental change. In contrast
to classical regime shifts, such rate-induced critical transitions do not
involve any obvious loss of stability, or a bifurcation, and thus cannot be
explained by the linear stability analysis. In this work, we demonstrate that
the well-known Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model can undergo a
rate-induced critical transition in response to a continuous decline in the
habitat quality, resulting in a collapse of the predator and prey populations.
Rather surprisingly, the collapse occurs even if the environmental change is
slower than the slowest process in the model. To explain this counterintuitive
phenomenon, we combine methods from geometric singular perturbation theory with
the concept of a moving equilibrium, and study critical rates of environmental
change with dependence on the initial state and the system parameters.
Moreover, for a fixed rate of environmental change, we determine the set of
initial states that undergo a rate-induced population collapse. Our results
suggest that ecosystems may be more sensitive to how fast environmental
conditions change than previously assumed. In particular, unexpected critical
transitions with dramatic ecological consequences can be triggered by
environmental changes that (i) do not exceed any dangerous levels, and (ii) are
slower than the natural timescales of the ecosystem. This poses an interesting
research question whether regime shifts observed in the natural world are
predominantly rate-induced or bifurcation-induced.

Here, we present an open-circuit conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM)
methodology for quantitative extraction of the axial piezoelectric coefficients
of nanowires. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the standard
short-circuit cAFM mode is inadequate for piezoelectric characterization of
nanowires, and that such measurements are governed by competing mechanisms. We
introduce an alternative open-circuit configuration, and employ time-resolved
electromechanical measurements, to extract the piezoelectric coefficients. This
method was applied to GaAs, an important semiconductor, with relatively low
piezoelectric coefficients. The results obtained for GaAs,~0.4-1 pm/V, are in
good agreement with existing knowledge and theory. Our method represents a
significant advance in understanding the coexistence of different
electromechanical effects, and in quantitative piezoelectric nanoscale
characterization. The easy implementation will enable better understanding of
electromechanics at the nanoscale.

we propose a NOMA rate control strategy that makes use only of topological

necessary conditions so that NOMA overcomes the OMA alternative, while we
discuss the optimum allocation strategies for the 2-user NOMA setup when
operating with equal rate or maximum sum-rate goals. In such scenario we show
that the user with the largest target error probability times the ratio between
the average receive signal power and the average interference power, should be
scheduled to be decoded first for optimum performance. We compare numerically
the performance of our allocation scheme with its ideal counterpart requiring
full CSI at the BSs and infinitely long blocklength, and show how the gap
increases as the reliability constraint becomes more stringent. Results also
evidence the benefits of NOMA when the co-interference can be efficiently
canceled, specially when the goal is to maximize the sum-rate.

city might not be as lucky as a worker in a large U.S. city, depending on the
type of large city in which one resides. Empirical studies found that large
U.S. cities exhibit resilience to automation impacts because of the increased
occupational and skill specialization. However, in this study, we observe
polarized responses in large Chinese cities to automation impacts. The
polarization might be attributed to the elaborate master planning of the
central government, through which cities are assigned with different industrial
goals to achieve globally optimal economic success and, thus, a fast-growing
economy. By dividing Chinese cities into two groups based on their
administrative levels and premium resources allocated by the central
government, we find that Chinese cities follow two distinct industrial
development trajectories, one trajectory owning government support leads to a
diversified industrial structure and, thus, a diversified job market, and the
other leads to specialty cities and, thus, a specialized job market. By
revisiting the automation impacts on a polarized job market, we observe a
Simpson's paradox through which a larger city of a diversified job market
results in greater resilience, whereas larger cities of specialized job markets
are more susceptible. These findings inform policy makers to deploy appropriate
policies to mitigate the polarized automation impacts.

fields of science therefore poses a significant challenge for generative
models. In cosmology, the large-scale, three-dimensional matter distribution,
modeled with N-body simulations, plays a crucial role in understanding the
evolution of the universe. As these simulations are computationally very
expensive, GANs have recently generated interest as a possible method to
emulate these datasets, but they have been, so far, mostly limited to two
dimensional data. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for the generation
of three dimensional N-body simulations, in order to stimulate new ideas in the
machine learning community and move closer to the practical use of generative
models in cosmology. As a first benchmark result, we propose a scalable GAN
approach for training a generator of N-body three-dimensional cubes. Our
technique relies on two key building blocks, (i) splitting the generation of
the high-dimensional data into smaller parts, and (ii) using a multi-scale
approach that efficiently captures global image features that might otherwise
be lost in the splitting process. We evaluate the performance of our model for
the generation of N-body samples using various statistical measures commonly
used in cosmology. Our results show that the proposed model produces samples of
high visual quality, although the statistical analysis reveals that capturing
rare features in the data poses significant problems for the generative models.

these two states, perturbations to the resonance frequency of the cavity can be
detected. Here, such an analysis is presented as a function of the strength of
the perturbation and of the noise. By increasing the standard deviation of the
noise, we find that the detection speed increases monotonically while the
sensitivity peaks at a finite value of the noise strength. Furthermore, we
discuss how noise-assisted sensing can be optimized in state-of-the-art
experimental platforms, relying solely on the minimum amount of noise present

radiation from products of astrophysical neutrino interactions with Baikal
water by a lattice of photodetectors submerged between the depths of 1275 and
730 m. The detector components are mounted on flexible strings and can drift
from their initial positions upwards to tens of meters. This introduces
positioning uncertainty which translates into a timing error for Cerenkov
signal registration. A spatial positioning system has been developed to resolve
this issue. In this contribution, we present the status of this system, results
of acoustic measurements and an estimate of positioning error for an individual
component.

on morphology than on structure. The present study focuses on urban structural
elements, i.e., urban hotspots consisting of high-density and high-intensity
socioeconomic zones, and explores the economic performance associated with
their spatial structure. We use nighttime luminosity (NTL) data and the Loubar
method to identify and extract the hotspot and ultimately draw two conclusions.
First, with population increasing, the hotspot number scales sublinearly with
an exponent of approximately 0.50~0.55, regardless of the location in China,
the EU or the US, while the intersect values are totally different, which is
mainly due to different economic developmental level. Secondly, we demonstrate
that the compactness of hotspots imposes an inverted U-shaped influence on
economic growth, which implies that an optimal compactness coefficient does
exist. These findings are helpful for urban planning.

the efficient numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). A
two-level domain decomposition method requires two main components: a one-level
preconditioner (or its corresponding smoothing iterative method), which is
based on domain decomposition techniques, and a coarse correction step, which
relies on a coarse space. The coarse space must properly represent the error
components that the chosen one-level method is not capable to deal with. In the
literature most of the works introduced efficient coarse spaces obtained as the
span of functions defined on the entire space domain of the considered PDE.
Therefore, the corresponding two-level preconditioners and iterative methods
are defined in volume.
  In this paper, a new class of substructured two-level methods is
introduced,for which both domain decomposition smoothers and coarse correction
steps are defined on the interfaces (or skeletons). This approach has several
advantages. On the one hand, the required computational effort is cheaper than
the one required by classical volumetric two-level methods. On the other hand,
it allows one to use some of the well-known efficient coarse spaces proposed in
the literature. While analyzing in detail the new substructured methods, we
present a new convergence analysis for two-level iterative methods, which
covers the proposed substructured framework. Further, we study the asymptotic
optimality of coarse spaces both theoretically and numerically using deep
neural networks. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed new numerical framework.

learning-based model capable of performing two tasks:- sparse depth completion
(i.e. generating complete dense scene depth given a sparse depth image as the
input) and monocular depth estimation (i.e. predicting scene depth from a
single RGB image) via two sub-networks jointly trained end to end using data
randomly sampled from a publicly available corpus of synthetic and real-world
images. The first sub-network generates a sparse depth image by learning lower
level features from the scene and the second predicts a full dense depth image
of the entire scene, leading to a better geometric and contextual understanding
of the scene and, as a result, superior performance of the approach. The entire
model can be used to infer complete scene depth from a single RGB image or the
second network can be used alone to perform depth completion given a sparse
depth input. Using adversarial training, a robust objective function, a deep
architecture relying on skip connections and a blend of synthetic and
real-world training data, our approach is capable of producing superior high
quality scene depth. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the
efficacy of our approach compared to contemporary state-of-the-art techniques

tested against a claimed speaker by his or her voice. Speaker verification is
done by the use of some parameters (features) from the speakers voice which can
be used to differentiate among many speakers. The efficiency of speaker
verification system mainly depends on the feature set providing high
inter-speaker variability and low intra-speaker variability. There are many
methods used for speaker verification. Some systems use Mel Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients as features (MFCCs), while others use Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
based speaker recognition, Support Vector Machines (SVM), GMMs . In this paper
simple intra-pitch temporal information in conjunction with pitch synchronous
cepstral coefficients forms the feature set. The distinct feature of a speaker
is determined from the steady state part of five cardinal spoken English
vowels. The performance was found to be average when these features were used
independently. But very encouraging results were observed when both features
were combined to form a decision for speaker verification. For a database of
twenty speakers of 100 utterances per speaker, an accuracy of 91.04% has been
observed. The analysis of speakers whose recognition was incorrect is conducted
and discussed .

Secondly, the sharp quantum resonance peaks are useful in the context of

measurement of fine structure constant. Most of the earlier works rely on

and socio-cultural World of human societies and their interactions. Identifying
pathways towards a sustainable future in these models for informing policy
makers and the wider public, e.g. pathways leading to a robust mitigation of
dangerous anthropogenic climate change, is a challenging and widely
investigated task in the field of climate research and broader Earth system
science. This problem is particularly difficult when constraints on avoiding
transgressions of planetary boundaries and social foundations need to be taken
into account. In this work, we propose to combine recently developed machine
learning techniques, namely deep reinforcement learning (DRL), with classical
analysis of trajectories in the World-Earth system. Based on the concept of the
agent-environment interface, we develop an agent that is generally able to act
and learn in variable manageable environment models of the Earth system. We
demonstrate the potential of our framework by applying DRL algorithms to two
stylized World-Earth system models. Conceptually, we explore thereby the
feasibility of finding novel global governance policies leading into a safe and
just operating space constrained by certain planetary and socio-economic
boundaries. The artificially intelligent agent learns that the timing of a
specific mix of taxing carbon emissions and subsidies on renewables is of
crucial relevance for finding World-Earth system trajectories that are
sustainable on the long term.

landscape, there are few tools to describe general features of their

are easily accessible but their full geometry is only explored in
non-equilibrium, e.g. after a quench. In the particular case of a
non-stationary system, however, the concepts of an order parameter and free
energy become ill-defined, and a comprehensive understanding of non-stationary
(transient) phase transitions is still lacking. Here, we probe transient
non-equilibrium dynamics of an optically pumped, dye-filled microcavity which
exhibits near-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation under steady-state
conditions. By rapidly exciting a large number of dye molecules, we quench the
system to a far-from-equilibrium state and, close to a critical excitation
energy, find delayed condensation, interpreted as a transient equivalent of
critical slowing down. We introduce the two-time, non-stationary, second-order
correlation function as a powerful experimental tool for probing the
statistical properties of the transient relaxation dynamics. In addition to
number fluctuations near the critical excitation energy, we show that transient
phase transitions exhibit a different form of diverging fluctuations, namely
timing jitter in the growth of the order parameter. This jitter is seeded by
the randomness associated with spontaneous emission, with its effect being
amplified near the critical point. The general character of our results are
then discussed based on the geometry of effective free-energy landscapes. We
thus identify universal features, such as the formation timing jitter, for a
larger set of systems undergoing transient phase transitions. Our results carry
immediate implications to diverse systems, including micro- and nano-lasers and
growth of colloidal nanoparticles.

Bayesian inverse problems. It samples particles from a prior distribution, and
introduces a motion to move the particles around in pseudo-time. As the
pseudo-time goes to infinity, the method finds the minimizer of the objective
function, and when the pseudo-time stops at $1$, the ensemble distribution of
the particles resembles, in some sense, the posterior distribution in the
linear setting. The ideas trace back further to Ensemble Kalman Filter and the
associated analysis, but to today, when viewed as a sampling method, why EKI
works, and in what sense with what rate the method converges is still largely
unknown.
  In this paper, we analyze the continuous version of EKI, a coupled SDE
system, and prove the mean field limit of this SDE system. In particular, we
will show that 1. as the number of particles goes to infinity, the empirical
measure of particles following SDE converges to the solution to a Fokker-Planck
equation in Wasserstein 2-distance with an optimal rate, for both linear and
weakly nonlinear case; 2. the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation
reconstructs the target distribution in finite time in the linear case.

collinear 4-body problem. It is known that any attempt to remove the
singularity via block regularisation will result in a regularised flow that is
no more than $ C^{8/3} $ differentiable with respect to initial conditions.
Through a blow-up of the singularity, this loss of differentiability is
investigated and a new proof of the $ C^{8/3} $ regularity is provided. In the
process, it is revealed that the collision manifold consists of two manifolds
of normally hyperbolic saddle singularities which are connected by a manifold
of heteroclinics. By utilising recent work on transitions near such objects and
their normal forms, an asymptotic series of the transition past the singularity
is explicitly computed. It becomes remarkably apparent that the finite
differentiability at $ 8/3 $ is due to the inability to construct a set of
integrals local to the simultaneous binary collision. The finite
differentiability is shown to be independent from a choice of initial condition
or value of the masses.

for many challenging porous media applications without scale separation and
high contrast. Our main focus is on nonlinear differential equations with
multiscale coefficients. The framework is built on nonlinear nonlocal
multi-continuum upscaling concept and significantly extends the results in the
proceeding paper.
  Our approach starts with a coarse space-time partition and identifies test
functions for each partition, which plays a role of multi-continua. The test
functions are defined via optimization and play a crucial role in nonlinear
upscaling. In the second stage, we solve nonlinear local problems in
oversampled regions with some constraints defined via test functions. These
local solutions define a nonlinear map from macroscopic variables determined
with the help of test functions to the fine-grid fields. This map can be
thought as a downscaled map from macroscopic variables to the fine-grid
solution. In the final stage, we seek macroscopic variables in the entire
domain such that the downscaled field solves the global problem in a weak sense
defined using the test functions. We present an analysis of our approach for an
example nonlinear problem.
  Our unified framework plays an important role in designing various upscaled
methods. Because local problems are directly related to the fine-grid problems,
it simplifies the process of finding local solutions with appropriate
constraints. Using machine learning (ML), we identify the complex map from
macroscopic variables to fine-grid solution. We present numerical results for
several porous media applications, including two-phase flow and transport.

general formula MAPbI_{3-y}Br_{y} or MAPbBr_{3-y}Cl_{y} (where y is between 0
and 3), and use first principles based density functional theory computations
to study their relative formation energies and charge transition levels. We
identify vacancy defects and Pb on MA anti-site defect as the lowest energy
native defects in each perovskite. We observe that while the low energy defects
in all MAPbI_{3-y}Br_{y} systems only create shallow transition levels, the Br
or Cl vacancy defects in the Cl-containing pervoskites have low energy and form
deep levels which become deeper for higher Cl content. Further, we study
extrinsic substitution by different elements at the Pb site in MAPbBr_{3},
MAPbCl_{3} and the 50-50 mixed halide perovskite, MAPbBr_{1.5}Cl_{1.5}, and
identify some transition metals that create lower energy defects than the
dominant intrinsic defects and also create mid-gap charge transition levels.

NLO corrections are included. In the absence of the latter, the LO EFT
overestimates kinematic distributions, such that over-optimistic constraints on
BSM contributions are obtained. We next examine the constraints on the EFT and
full models that are expected to be obtained from both top pair and four top

similar exclusion power. However, for larger masses, estimated LHC

with $k$ disjoint cycles. Let $p$ be a prime. In recent years, Lengyel, Komatsu
and Young, Leonetti and Sanna, Adelberg, Hong and Qiu made some progress in the
study of the $p$-adic valuations of $s(n,k)$. In this paper, by using
Washington's congruence on the generalized harmonic number and the $n$-th
Bernoulli number $B_n$ and the properties of $m$-th Stirling numbers of the
first kind obtained recently by the authors, we arrive at an exact expression
or a lower bound of $v_p(s(ap, k))$ with $a$ and $k$ being integers such that
$1\le a\le p-1$ and $1\le k\le ap$. This infers that for any regular prime
$p\ge 7$ and for arbitrary integers $a$ and $k$ with $5\le a\le p-1$ and
$a-2\le k\le ap-1$, one has $v_p(H(ap-1,k))<-\frac{\log{(ap-1)}}{2\log p}$ with
$H(ap-1, k)$ being the $k$-th elementary symmetric function of $1, \frac{1}{2},

The interpolated slices are then fused and refined in the axial direction for
improved consistency. Since MSR consists of only 2D operations, it is more
feasible in terms of GPU memory consumption and requires fewer training samples
compared to 3D CNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms traditional linear interpolation and baseline 2D/3D CNN-based
approaches. We conclude by showcasing the method's practical utility in

Loss Estimator (Spline HAL-MLE) of a functional parameter that is defined by
minimizing the empirical risk function over an $m$-th order smoothness class of
functions. We show that this $m$-th order smoothness class consists of all
functions that can be represented as an infinitesimal linear combination of
tensor products of $\leq m$-th order spline-basis functions, and involves
assuming $m$-derivatives in each coordinate. By selecting $m$ with
cross-validation we obtain a Spline-HAL-MLE that is able to adapt to the
underlying unknown smoothness of the true function, while guaranteeing a rate
of convergence faster than $n^{-1/4}$, as long as the true function is cadlag
(right-continuous with left-hand limits) and has finite sectional variation
norm. The $m=0$-smoothness class consists of all cadlag functions with finite
sectional variation norm and corresponds with the original HAL-MLE defined in
van der Laan (2015).
  In this article we establish that this Spline-HAL-MLE yields an
asymptotically efficient estimator of any smooth feature of the functional
parameter under an easily verifiable global undersmoothing condition. A
sufficient condition for the latter condition is that the minimum of the
empirical mean of the selected basis functions is smaller than a constant times
$n^{-1/2}$, which is not parameter specific and enforces the selection of the
$L_1$-norm in the lasso to be large enough to include sparsely supported basis.
We demonstrate our general result for the $m=0$-HAL-MLE of the average
treatment effect and of the integral of the square of the data density. We also

feature refinement module is to re-encode the position information of the

pixel-wise feature interpolation to realize feature reconstruction and
alignment. For more accurate rotation estimation, an approximate SkewIoU loss

execution time for several classes of jobs. Prior work has demonstrated a
natural tradeoff between computation and communication whereby running
redundant copies of jobs can reduce the Shuffle traffic load, thereby leading
to reduced overall execution times. For a single job, the main drawback of this
approach is that it requires the original job to be split into a number of
files that grows exponentially in the system parameters. When extended to
multiple jobs (with specific function types), these techniques suffer from a
limitation of a similar flavor, i.e., they require an exponentially large
number of jobs to be executed. In practical scenarios, these requirements can
significantly reduce the promised gains of the method. In this work, we show
that a class of combinatorial structures called resolvable designs can be used
to develop efficient coded distributed computing schemes for both the single
and multiple job scenarios considered in prior work. We present both
theoretical analysis and exhaustive experimental results (on Amazon EC2
clusters) that demonstrate the performance advantages of our method. For the
single and multiple job cases, we obtain speed-ups of 4.69x (and 2.6x over
prior work) and 4.31x over the baseline approach, respectively.

to quantitative imaging for lung cancer detection and monitoring. This study of
CT-detected lung nodules investigated the reproducibility of volume-, density-,
and texture-based features (outcome variables) over routine ranges of
radiation-dose, reconstruction kernel, and slice thickness. CT raw data of 23
nodules were reconstructed using 320 acquisition/reconstruction conditions
(combinations of 4 doses, 10 kernels, and 8 thicknesses). Scans at 12.5%, 25%,
and 50% of protocol dose were simulated; reduced-dose and full-dose data were
reconstructed using conventional filtered back-projection and
iterative-reconstruction kernels at a range of thicknesses (0.6-5.0 mm).
Full-dose/B50f kernel reconstructions underwent expert segmentation for
reference Region-Of-Interest (ROI) and nodule volume per thickness; each ROI
was applied to 40 corresponding images (combinations of 4 doses and 10
kernels). Typical texture analysis metrics (including 5 histogram features, 13
Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix, 5 Run Length Matrix, 2 Neighboring Gray-Level
Dependence Matrix, and 2 Neighborhood Gray-Tone Difference Matrix) were
computed per ROI. Reconstruction conditions resulting in no significant change
in volume, density, or texture metrics were identified as ""compatible pairs""
for a given outcome variable. Our results indicate that as thickness increases,
volumetric reproducibility decreases, while reproducibility of histogram- and
texture-based features across different acquisition and reconstruction
parameters improves. In order to achieve concomitant reproducibility of
volumetric and radiomic results across studies, balanced standardization of the
imaging acquisition parameters is required.

(Re-ID) case, which only has the intra-camera (within-camera) labels but not
inter-camera (cross-camera) labels. In real-world applications, these
intra-camera labels can be readily captured by tracking algorithms or few
manual annotations, when compared with cross-camera labels. In this case, it is
very difficult to explore the relationships between cross-camera persons in the
training stage due to the lack of cross-camera label information. To deal with
this issue, we propose a novel Progressive Cross-camera Soft-label Learning
(PCSL) framework for the semi-supervised person Re-ID task, which can generate
cross-camera soft-labels and utilize them to optimize the network. Concretely,
we calculate an affinity matrix based on person-level features and adapt them
to produce the similarities between cross-camera persons (i.e., cross-camera
soft-labels). To exploit these soft-labels to train the network, we investigate
the weighted cross-entropy loss and the weighted triplet loss from the
classification and discrimination perspectives, respectively. Particularly, the
proposed framework alternately generates progressive cross-camera soft-labels
and gradually improves feature representations in the whole learning course.
Extensive experiments on five large-scale benchmark datasets show that PCSL
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods that employ
labeled source domains or the images generated by the GAN-based models.
Furthermore, the proposed method even has a competitive performance with
respect to deep supervised Re-ID methods.

$40$ times of the practical bound and $13$ times of the absolute bound with

research presented in this thesis has focused on the identification of

attention is given to the analysis of objective differences between disorders,
as well as identification of clinical episodes of mania and depression in
bipolar patients, and deterioration in borderline personality disorder

psychiatric patients, based on measurable changes in behaviour, represented in
physical activity time series, collected via mobile and wearable devices. The
framework defines methods for direct computational analysis of symptoms in
disorganisation and psychomotor dimensions, as well as measures for indirect
assessment of mood, using patterns of physical activity, sleep and circadian

count values are limited in reality, which means only a small closed set is
observed. Existing methods typically model this task in a regression manner,
while they are likely to suffer from an unseen scene with counts out of the
scope of the closed set. In fact, counting is decomposable. A dense region can
always be divided until sub-region counts are within the previously observed
closed set. Inspired by this idea, we propose a simple but effective approach,
Spatial Divide-and- Conquer Network (S-DCNet). S-DCNet only learns from a
closed set but can generalize well to open-set scenarios via S-DC. S-DCNet is
also efficient. To avoid repeatedly computing sub-region convolutional
features, S-DC is executed on the feature map instead of on the input image.

important role in fluid mechanics in vortical structure identification and in
the modeling of various complex fluids. For the simulation of flows accompanied
by the advection-diffusion transport of a scalar field, double distribution
functions (DDF) based lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs) are commonly used. We
present a new local vorticity computation approach by introducing an
intensional anisotropy of the scalar flux in the third order, off-diagonal
moment equilibria of the LB scheme for the scalar field, and then combining the
second order non-equilibrium components of both the LBMs. As such, any pair of
lattice sets in the DDF formulation that can independently support the third
order off-diagonal moments would enable local determination of the complete
flow kinematics, with the LBMs for the fluid motion and the transport of the
passive scalar respectively providing the necessary moment relationships to
determine the symmetric and skew-symmetric components of the velocity gradient
tensor. Since the resulting formulation is completely local and do not rely on
finite difference approximations for velocity derivatives, it is by design
naturally suitable for parallel computation. As an illustration of our
approach, we formulate a DDF-LB scheme for local vorticity computation using a
pair of multiple relaxation times (MRT) based collision approaches on
two-dimensional, nine velocity (D2Q9) lattices, where the necessary moment
relationships to determine the velocity gradient tensor and the vorticity are
established via a Chapman-Enskog analysis. Simulations of various benchmark
flows demonstrate good accuracy of the predicted vorticity fields, with a
second order convergence. Furthermore, extensions of our formulation for a
variety of collision models to enable local vorticity computation are
presented.

  Capillary Pressure",,,"10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103631",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Wettability is a pore-scale property that has an important impact on
capillarity, residual trapping, and hysteresis in porous media systems. In many
applications, the wettability of the rock surface is assumed to be constant in
time and uniform in space. However, many fluids are capable of altering the
wettability of rock surfaces permanently and dynamically in time. Experiments
have shown wettability alteration can significantly decrease capillarity in
CO$_2$ storage applications. For these systems, the standard capillary-pressure
model that assumes static wettability is insufficient to describe the physics.
In this paper, we develop a new dynamic capillary-pressure model that takes
into account changes in wettability at the pore-level by adding a dynamic term
to the standard capillary pressure function. We simulate the dynamic system
using a bundle-of-tubes (BoT) approach, where a mechanistic model for
time-dependent contact angle change is introduced at the pore scale. The
resulting capillary pressure curves are then used to quantify the dynamic
component of the capillary pressure function. This study shows the importance
of time-dependent wettability for determining capillary pressure over
timescales of months to years. The impact of wettability has implications for
experimental methodology as well as macroscale simulation of
wettability-altering fluids.

rarely used in medicine. This work shows their application to generate heatmaps
that allow to resolve common challenges encountered in deep learning-based
digital histopathology analyses. These challenges comprise biases typically
inherent to histopathology data. We study binary classification tasks of tumor
tissue discrimination in publicly available haematoxylin and eosin slides of
various tumor entities and investigate three types of biases: (1) biases which
affect the entire dataset, (2) biases which are by chance correlated with class
labels and (3) sampling biases. While standard analyses focus on patch-level
evaluation, we advocate pixel-wise heatmaps, which offer a more precise and
versatile diagnostic instrument and furthermore help to reveal biases in the
data. This insight is shown to not only detect but also to be helpful to remove
the effects of common hidden biases, which improves generalization within and
across datasets. For example, we could see a trend of improved area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve by 5% when reducing a labeling bias.
Explanation techniques are thus demonstrated to be a helpful and highly
relevant tool for the development and the deployment phases within the life

In this paper, we investigate simultaneously the security and computation

improve the offloading security, we propose a trustworthy access control using
blockchain, which can protect cloud resources against illegal offloading
behaviours. Then, to tackle the computation management of authorized MDs, we
formulate a computation offloading problem by jointly optimizing the offloading

costs of latency, energy consumption and smart contract fee among all MDs. To
solve the proposed offloading problem, we develop an advanced deep

formulate task offloading and user privacy preservation as a joint optimization

to minimize the long-term system offloading costs and maximize the privacy

larger-scale blockchain scenarios, we then develop a deep RL algorithm by using
deep Q-network which can efficiently solve large state space without any prior

preliminary guide to probe latent emotions in text through GloVe word vectors.
First, we trained a neural network model to predict continuous emotion valence
ratings by taking linguistic inputs from Stanford Emotional Narratives Dataset
(SEND). After interpreting the weights in the model, we found that only a few
dimensions of the word vectors contributed to expressing emotions in text, and
words were clustered on the basis of their emotional polarities. Furthermore,
we performed a linear transformation that projected high dimensional embedded
vectors into an emotion space. Based on NRC Emotion Lexicon (EmoLex), we
visualized the entanglement of emotions in the lexicon by using both projected
and raw GloVe word vectors. We showed that, in the proposed emotion space, we
were able to better disentangle emotions than using raw GloVe vectors alone. In
addition, we found that the sum vectors of different pairs of emotion words
successfully captured expressed human feelings in the EmoLex. For example, the
sum of two embedded word vectors expressing Joy and Trust which express Love
shared high similarity (similarity score .62) with the embedded vector
expressing Optimism. On the contrary, this sum vector was dissimilar
(similarity score -.19) with the the embedded vector expressing Remorse. In
this paper, we argue that through the proposed emotion space, arithmetic of
emotions is preserved in the word vectors. The affective representation
uncovered in emotion vector space could shed some light on how to help machines
to disentangle emotion expressed in word embeddings.

We question some common
assumptions about the thermodynamics of life and illustrate how, contrary to
widespread belief, even in a closed system entropy growth can accompany an
increase in macroscopic order. We consider viewing metabolism in living things
as microscopic variables directly driven by the second law of thermodynamics,
while viewing the macroscopic variables of structure, complexity and
homeostasis as mechanisms that are entropically favored because they open
channels for entropy to grow via metabolism. This perspective reverses the
conventional relation between structure and metabolism, by emphasizing the role
of structure for metabolism rather than the other way around. Structure extends
in time, preserving information along generations, particularly in the genetic
code, but also in human culture. We also consider why the increase in
order/complexity over time is often stepwise and sometimes collapses
catastrophically. We point out the relevance of the notions of metastable
states and channels between these, which are discovered by random motion of the
system and lead it into ever-larger regions of the phase space, driven by
thermodynamics. We note that such changes in state can lead to either increase
or decrease in order; and sometimes to complete collapse, as in biological
extinction. Finally, we comment on the implications of these dynamics for the
future of humanity.

context of Intelligent Transportation Systems by using Machine Learning
techniques to analyze acceleration time series acquired with smartphone-based
opportunistic sensing to automatically detect, classify, and characterize
events of interest.
  Two aspects of road quality assessment are addressed: the detection and the
characterization of road anomalies. For the first, the most widely cited works
in the literature are compared and proposals capable of equal or better
performance are presented, removing the reliance on threshold values and
reducing the computational cost and dimensionality of previous proposals. For
the second, new approaches for the estimation of pothole depth and the
functional condition of speed reducers are showed. The new problem of pothole
depth ranking is introduced, using a learning-to-rank approach to sort
acceleration signals by the depth of the potholes that they reflect.
  The classification of aggressive driving maneuvers is done with automatic
feature extraction, finding characteristically shaped subsequences in the
signals as more effective discriminants than conventional descriptors
calculated over time windows.
  Finally, all the previously mentioned tasks are combined to produce a robust
road transport evaluation platform.

compare with manual system of integration and analysis and also could be used
by the management to make faster and more efficient decision in order to map or
plan efficient teaching approach for students in the future.

Kane","Single femtosecond laser pulse interaction with mica",,,"10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.145702",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ultrafast, femtosecond laser pulse interaction with dielectric materials has
shown them to have significantly higher laser fluence threshold requirements,
as compared to metals and semiconductors, for laser material modification, such
as laser ablation. Examples of dielectrics are crystalline materials such as
quartz and sapphire, and amorphous glasses. The interaction between femtosecond
laser pulses, at a wavelength with negligible linear absorption, and a
dielectric has been found to be weak, and multiple pulse irradiation is
therefore typically used in order to see significant and quantifiable effects.
In this study the dielectric is the crystalline, layered, natural mineral
muscovite, a mica with formula KAl_2 (Si_3 Al) O_10 (OH)_2. Muscovite, newly
cleaved, is used in a wide range of technological and scientific applications
including as an insulating material in electronics and as an ultra-flat and
ultra-clean substrate. A single, ~800 nm wavelength, ~6 micron spotsize, ~150
fs laser pulse is found to lead to a systematic range of laser modification
topologies, as a function of the fluence of the single laser pulse, including
bulk removal of material. The fs laser pulse/material interaction is greater
than expected for a standard dielectric at a given fluence. Optical surface
profiling and FESEM are used to characterise the topologies. Contrasting the
results of the two techniques supports the use of optical surface profiling to
characterise the material modification despite its limitations in lateral
resolution as compared to FESEM. The interlayer mineral water content of
natural muscovite is proposed as the primary reason that mica behaves
differently to a standard dielectric when irradiated with a single 800 nm fs
laser pulse.

  Machine Vision, Cardiff, UK",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning system have drawback that their output is not accompanied with
ex-planation. In a domain such as forensic handwriting verification it is
essential to provideexplanation to jurors. The goal of handwriting verification
is to find a measure of confi-dence whether the given handwritten samples are
written by the same or different writer.We propose a method to generate
explanations for the confidence provided by convolu-tional neural network (CNN)
which maps the input image to 15 annotations (features)provided by experts. Our
system comprises of: (1) Feature learning network (FLN),a differentiable
system, (2) Inference module for providing explanations. Furthermore,inference
module provides two types of explanations: (a) Based on cosine
similaritybetween categorical probabilities of each feature, (b) Based on
Log-Likelihood Ratio(LLR) using directed probabilistic graphical model. We
perform experiments using acombination of feature learning network (FLN) and
each inference module. We evaluateour system using XAI-AND dataset, containing
13700 handwritten samples and 15 cor-responding expert examined features for
each sample. The dataset is released for publicuse and the methods can be
extended to provide explanations on other verification taskslike face
verification and bio-medical comparison. This dataset can serve as the basis
and benchmark for future research in explanation based handwriting
verification. The code is available on github.

winding arrangements, at presence of eddy currents and skin effect, is studied.
By using different winding structures, and conductor types, such as circular,
square shaped, and foil wires, the skin effect in the windings is studied and
current density within the conductors at a high frequency of 20 MHz and a lower
frequency of 20 kHz are investigated using finite element method (FEM)
simulation. Moreover, magnetic field distribution in the transformers at 20 MHz
is obtained and displayed. Also, magnetizing inductance, leakage inductance and
AC winding resistance for all of the transformer types are found and compared,
and frequency response for the transformers are obtained and shown. Lastly,
based on the results, the skin effect increases the AC winding resistance and
decreases the leakage inductance as the frequency increases. Furthermore,
different winding arrangements, conductors, and transformer types show a wide
range of parasitic and loss behavior, which enable the designers to compromise
between various parameters in different applications, especially new fast
switches such as SiC and GaN.
