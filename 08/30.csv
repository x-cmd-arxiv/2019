absence of the necessary informative clue from explicit connectives. The
prediction of relations requires a deep understanding of the semantic meanings
of sentence pairs. As implicit discourse relation recognizer has to carefully
tackle the semantic similarity of the given sentence pairs and the severe data
sparsity issue exists in the meantime, it is supposed to be beneficial from
mastering the entire training data. Thus in this paper, we propose a novel
memory mechanism to tackle the challenges for further performance improvement.
The memory mechanism is adequately memorizing information by pairing
representations and discourse relations of all training instances, which right
fills the slot of the data-hungry issue in the current implicit discourse
relation recognizer. Our experiments show that our full model with memorizing
the entire training set reaches new state-of-the-art against strong baselines,
which especially for the first time exceeds the milestone of 60% accuracy in
the 4-way task.

Our objective is to penalize peaks of power demand, smooth the load profile and
enable Demand Side Management (DSM). The proposed architecture and methods
exploit only local measurements of power consumption via Smart Power Sockets
(SPSs) with no access to their internal temperature. No centralized aggregator
of information is exploited and agents preserve their privacy by cooperating
anonymously only through consensus-based distributed estimation, robust to
node/link failure. The interactions among devices are designed to occur through
an unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) network over the internet. The architecture
includes novel methods for parameter identification, state estimation and mixed
logical modelling of TCLs and SPSs. It is designed from a multi-agent and
plug-and-play perspective in which existing household appliances can interact
with each other in an urban environment. Finally, a novel low cost testbed is
proposed along with numerical tests and an experimental validation.

have an important influence on the purchase decision of each customer, it is
intuitive that personalization should be beneficial for product search engines.
While synthetic experiments from previous studies show that purchase histories
are useful for identifying the individual intent of each product search
session, the effect of personalization on product search in practice, however,
remains mostly unknown. In this paper, we formulate the problem of personalized
product search and conduct large-scale experiments with search logs sampled

analysis show that the potential of personalization depends on query
characteristics, interactions between queries, and user purchase histories.
Based on these observations, we propose a Zero Attention Model for product

energy and convert it into mechanical work. Biological machines have evolved to
transport cargo, facilitate folding of proteins and RNA, remodel chromatin and
replicate DNA. A common aspect of these machines is that their functions are
driven out of equilibrium. It is a challenge to provide a general framework for
understanding the functions of biological machines, such as molecular motors,
molecular chaperones, and helicases. Using these machines as prototypical
examples, we describe a few general theoretical methods providing insights into
their functions. Although the theories rely on coarse-graining of these complex
systems they have proven useful in not only accounting for many in vitro
experiments but also addressing questions such as how the trade-off between
precision, energetic costs and optimal performances are balanced. However, many
complexities associated with biological machines will require one to go beyond
current theoretical methods. Simple point mutations in the enzyme could
drastically alter functions, making the motors bi-directional or result in
unexpected diseases or dramatically restrict the capacity of molecular
chaperones to help proteins fold. These examples are reminders that while the
search for principles of generality in biology is intellectually stimulating,
one also ought to keep in mind that molecular details must be accounted for to
develop a deeper understanding of processes driven by biological machines.
Going beyond generic descriptions of in vitro behavior to making genuine
understanding of in vivo functions will likely remain a major challenge for
some time to come. The combination of careful experiments and the use of
physical principles will be useful in elucidating the rules governing the

$\zeta$ has an arbitrary $B-L$ charge $Q$ chosen to guarantee its stability. We
focus on the small $Z_{BL}$ mass and small $g_{BL}$ regions of the model, and
find new constraints for the cases where the DM relic abundance arises from

liquid in favor of a magnetically ordered state.[3,4] Here we report the
discovery of a version of such a `Kondo lattice' material, YbIr$_3$Si$_7$, in
which the number of free charge carriers is much less than the number of local

to zero at low temperatures as all the free carriers are consumed in the
formation of Kondo singlets. This effect coexists with antiferromagnetic
long-range order, with a N\'eel temperature $T\rm_N = 4.1\,{\rm K}$.
Furthermore, the material shows conductive surface states with potential
topological nature, and thus presents an exciting topic for future

achieve performance, and they employ a variety of technologies to improve
performance, including compiler technology. But compilers in machine-learning
frameworks lack a deep understanding of parallelism, causing them to lose
performance by missing optimizations on parallel computation. This work studies
how Tapir, a compiler intermediate representation (IR) that embeds parallelism
into a mainstream compiler IR, can be incorporated into a compiler for machine
learning to remedy this problem. TapirXLA modifies the XLA compiler in
TensorFlow to employ the Tapir/LLVM compiler to optimize low-level parallel

operations using Tapir's representation of fork-join parallelism. TapirXLA also
exposes to the compiler implementations of linear-algebra library routines
whose parallel operations are encoded using Tapir's representation. We compared
the performance of TensorFlow using TapirXLA against TensorFlow using an
unmodified XLA compiler. On four neural-network benchmarks, TapirXLA speeds up
the parallel running time of the network by a geometric-mean multiplicative

that particles with spins $s\leq 2$ are fundamental to argue that the

lighter supersymmetric particle provides a feasible way to accommodate the

spectrum of the neutralino DM and its coannihilating partner, which results in
the soft final states and makes the searches for sparticles challenging at
colliders. On the other hand, the abundance of the freeze-out neutralino DM
usually increases as the DM mass becomes heavier. This implies an upper bound
on the mass of the neutralino DM. Given these observations, we explore the
HE-LHC coverage of the neutralino DM for the coannihilations. By analyzing the
events of the multijet with the missing transverse energy ($E^{miss}_T$), the
monojet, the soft lepton pair plus $E^{miss}_T$, and the monojet plus a
hadronic tau, we find that the neutralino DM mass can be excluded up to 2.6,
1.7 and 0.8 TeV in the gluino, stop and wino coannihilations at the $2\sigma$

cosmological perturbations. In single field inflationary models, such
perturbations can be seeded as the inflaton overshoots a small barrier on its
way down the potential. PBHs are then produced through two distinct mechanisms,
during the radiation era. The first one is the familiar collapse of large
adiabatic overdensities. The second one is the collapse induced by relic
bubbles where the inflaton field is trapped in a false vacuum, due to large
backward fluctuations which prevented horizon sized regions from overshooting
the barrier. We consider (numerically and analytically) the effect of
non-Gaussianities on the threshold for overdensities to collapse into a PBH.
Since typical high peaks have some dispersion in their shape or profile, we
also consider the effect of such dispersion on the corresponding threshold for
collapse. With these results we estimate the most likely channel for PBH
production as a function of the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\rm NL}$. We also
compare the threshold for collapse coming from the perturbative versus the non
perturbative template for the non-Gaussianity arising in this model. We show
that i) for $f_{\rm NL}\gtrsim 3.5$, the population of PBH coming from false
vacuum regions dominates over that which comes from the collapse of large
adiabatic overdensities, ii) the non-perturbative template of the
non-Gaussianities is important to get accurate results. iii) the effect of the
dispersion is small in determining the threshold for the compaction function,
although it can be appreciable in determining the threshold amplitude for the
curvature perturbation at low $f_{\rm NL}$. We also confirm that the volume
averaged compaction function provides a very accurate universal estimator for
the threshold.

meridian of the knot to a fixed conjugacy class. It has the interesting feature
that it determines the Tristram-Levine signature of the knot associated to the
conjugacy class chosen.
  Turning things around, given a 4-manifold $X$ with the integral homology of
$S^{1}\times S^{3}$, and an embedded torus $T$ inside $X$ such that
$H_{1}(T;\mathbb{Z})$ surjects onto $H_{1}(X;\mathbb{Z})$, we define a signed
count of conjugacy classes of irreducible representations of the torus
complement into $SU(2)$ which satisfy an analogous fixed conjugacy class
condition to the one mentioned above for the knot case. Our count recovers the
Casson-Lin-Herald invariant of the knot in the product case, thus it can be
regarded as implicitly defining a Tristram-Levine signature for tori.
  This count can also be considered as a singular Furuta-Ohta invariant, and it
is a special case of a larger family of Donaldson invariants which we also
define. In particular, when $(X,T)$ is obtained from a self-concordance of a
knot $(Y,K)$ satisfying an admissibility condition, these Donaldson invariants
are related to the Lefschetz number of an Instanton Floer homology for knots
which we construct. Moreover, from these Floer groups we obtain Fr{\o}yshov
invariants for knots which allows us to assign a Fr{\o}yshov invariant to an
embedded torus whenever it arises from such a self-concordance.

is usually associated with the gap opening and at a first glance is
inconsistent with the fact that FeSe remains a metal below $T_n$, with sizable
hole and electron pockets. We argue that the drop of $R_{B_{1g}}$ in a nematic

content of the pockets and makes them nearly mono-orbital. In this situation
$B_{1g}$ Raman response gets reduced by the same vertex corrections that

rise to gap-like behavior of $R_{B_{1g}}$, in full agreement with the

convergence is poor due to gradient vanishing caused by the interaction between
residual connections and layer normalization. We propose depth-scaled
initialization (DS-Init), which decreases parameter variance at the
initialization stage, and reduces output variance of residual connections so as
to ease gradient back-propagation through normalization layers. To address
computational cost, we propose a merged attention sublayer (MAtt) which
combines a simplified averagebased self-attention sublayer and the
encoderdecoder attention sublayer on the decoder side. Results on WMT and IWSLT
translation tasks with five translation directions show that deep Transformers
with DS-Init and MAtt can substantially outperform their base counterpart in

ago and is virtually gas-free, while analogs in the field are predominantly
star-forming and gas-rich. We use deep imaging obtained with the Large
Binocular Telescope to show that DDO 113 exhibits no evidence of tidal
disruption to a surface brightness of $\mu_V\sim29$ mag $\text{arcsec}^{-2}$,
based on both unresolved emission and resolved stars. Mass-analogs of DDO 113
in Illustris-1 with similar hosts, small projected separations, and no
significant tidal stripping first fell into their host halo 2--6 Gyr ago,
showing that tidal features (or lack thereof) can be used to constrain infall
times in systems where there are few other constraints on the orbit of the
satellite. With the infall time setting the clock for environmental quenching
mechanisms, we investigate the plausibility of several such mechanisms. We find
that strangulation, the cessation of cold gas inflows, is likely the dominant
quenching mechanism for DDO 113, requiring a time-averaged mass-loading factor
of $\eta=6-11$ for star-formation-driven outflows that is consistent with
theoretical and observational constraints. Motivated by recent numerical work,
we connect DDO 113's strangulation to the presence of a cool circumgalactic
medium (CGM) around NGC 4214. This discovery shows that the CGM of low-mass

events. To this end, various methods have already been developed like the
method developed by Aschwanden et al. 2015 \cite{AschwandenB2015} which is
based on Gaussian fit for Differential Emission Measure (DEM). Here, we use the
intensity ratios of the images in three different wavelengths and the
temperature response functions of AIA to extract the temperature of the loop.
In this paper, we use EUV images of the solar active region 11092 taken by AIA
instrument of the SDO satellite at 171, 193, and 211 $A^{0}$ wavelengths, at
1th of August, 2010. We select a loop in a subregion of 11092 and extract its
temperature by the help of intensity profiles in different wavelengths and
thermal response functions of different filters. In this subregion cooling of
the loop happens and in the selected loop, highest relative intensity of the
wavelengths of 171 $A^{0}$ to 193 $A^{0}$ was obtained to be $0.76$ and this
number was estimated to correspond to the temperature of 1.3 million degree of
Kelvin, which is the maximum temperature point of this loop's internal area.
The highest values of the intensity ratios at the wavelengths of 211$A^{0}$ to
193$A^{0}$, and 211$A^{0}$ to 171$A^{0}$ are $0.22$ and $0.25$, which
correspond to temperature values around 10M and 1.4M Kelvin in sequence,
related to the temperature of hotter and more superficial points of the loop
respectively. These values are very sensitive to time and differ in time series
of this event of the loop intensity variation.

loop. However, frequency tunablity introduces an additional dephasing mechanism
from magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we experimentally study the
contribution of instrumentation noise to flux instability and the resulting
error rate of parametrically activated two-qubit gates. Specifically, we
measure the qubit coherence time under flux modulation while injecting
broadband noise through the flux control channel. We model the noise's effect
using a dephasing rate model that matches well to the measured rates, and use
it to prescribe a noise floor required to achieve a desired two-qubit gate
infidelity. Finally, we demonstrate that low-pass filtering the AC signal used
to drive two-qubit gates between the first and second harmonic frequencies can
reduce qubit sensitivity to flux noise at the AC sweet spot (ACSS), confirming
an earlier theoretical prediction. The framework we present to determine
instrumentation noise floors required for high entangling two-qubit gate
fidelity should be extensible to other quantum information processing systems.

a cell is swimming, crawling, or combining these motions. Our simple model of a
cell, based on the three-sphere swimmer, is capable of both swimming and
crawling. As cell-matrix adhesion strength increases, the influence of
hydrodynamics on migration diminish. Cells with significant adhesion can crawl
with speeds much larger than their nonadherent, swimming counterparts. We
predict that, while most eukaryotic cells are in the strong-adhesion limit,
increasing environment viscosity or decreasing cell-matrix adhesion could lead
to significant hydrodynamic effects even in crawling cells. Signatures of
hydrodynamic effects include dependence of cell speed on the medium viscosity
or the presence of a nearby substrate and the presence of interactions between
noncontacting cells. These signatures will be suppressed at large adhesion
strengths, but even strongly adherent cells will generate relevant fluid flows

This theoretical bias severely limits the exploration of BSM phenomenology, and
is especially constraining for extended Higgs sectors. Such limitations can be
avoided in the context of Spontaneous Flavor Violation (SFV), a robust and UV
complete framework that allows for significant couplings to any up or down-type
quark, while suppressing flavor-changing neutral currents via flavor alignment.
In this work we study the theory and phenomenology of extended SFV Higgs
sectors with large couplings to any quark generation. We perform a
comprehensive analysis of flavor and collider constraints of extended SFV Higgs
sectors, and demonstrate that new Higgs bosons with large couplings to the
light quarks may be found at the electroweak scale. In particular, we find that
new Higgses as light as 100 GeV with order $\sim$ 0.1 couplings to first or
second generation quarks, which are copiously produced at LHC via quark fusion,
are allowed by current constraints. Furthermore, the additional SFV Higgses can
mix with the SM Higgs, providing strong theory motivation for an experimental

planet formation theories, both in cases where planets must have formed in very
compact discs around the individual stars and where they are located near the
edge of the stable circumbinary region, where in situ formation is challenging.
Dust dynamics is expected to play an important role in such systems, since dust
trapping at the inner edge of circumbinary discs could aid in situ formation,
but would simultaneously starve the circumstellar discs of the solid material
needed to form planets. Here we investigate the dynamics of dust in binary
systems using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics. We find that all our simulations
tend towards dust trapping in the circumbinary disc, but the timescale on which
trapping begins depends on binary mass ratio ($q$) and eccentricity as well as
the angular momentum of the infalling material. For $q \gtrsim 0.1$, we find
that dust can initially accrete onto the circumstellar discs, but as the
circumbinary cavity grows in radius, dust eventually becomes trapped in the
circumbinary disc. For $q = 0.01$, we find that increasing the binary
eccentricity increases the time required for dust trapping to begin. However,
even this longer timescale is likely to be shorter than the planet formation
timescale in the inner disc and is insufficient to explain the observed
pre-transitional discs. This indicates that increase in companion eccentricity
alone is not enough to allow significant transfer of solids from the outer to
the inner disc.

(CGM) and the quenching and morphological evolution of central galaxies in the
EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations. The simulations yield very different median
CGM mass fractions, $f_{\rm CGM}$, as a function of halo mass, $M_{200}$, with
low-mass haloes being significantly more gas-rich in IllustrisTNG than in
EAGLE. Nonetheless, in both cases scatter in $f_{\rm CGM}$ at fixed $M_{200}$
is strongly correlated with the specific star formation rate and the kinematic
morphology of central galaxies. The correlations are strongest for $\sim
L^\star$ galaxies, corresponding to the mass scale at which AGN feedback
becomes efficient. This feedback elevates the CGM cooling time, preventing gas
from accreting onto the galaxy to fuel star formation, and thus establishing a
preference for quenched, spheroidal galaxies to be hosted by haloes with low
$f_{\rm CGM}$ for their mass. In both simulations, $f_{\rm CGM}$ correlates
negatively with the host halo's intrinsic concentration, and hence with its
binding energy and formation redshift, primarily because early halo formation
fosters the rapid early growth of the central black hole (BH). This leads to a
lower $f_{\rm CGM}$ at fixed $M_{200}$ in EAGLE because the BH reaches high
accretion rates sooner, whilst in IllustrisTNG it occurs because the central BH
reaches the mass threshold at which AGN feedback is assumed to switch from
thermal to kinetic injection earlier. Despite these differences, there is
consensus from these state-of-the-art simulations that the expulsion of
efficiently-cooling gas from the CGM is a crucial step in the quenching and
morphological evolution of central galaxies.

temperature falls below ~1500-1800 K, dust is able to survive. It is thus
possible to have a large dusty structure present which surrounds the AGN. This
is the first of two papers aiming at comparing six dusty torus models with
available SEDs, namely Fritz et al. (2006), Nenkova et al. (2008B), Hoenig &
Kishimoto (2010), Siebenmorgen et al. (2015), Stalevski et al. (2016), and
Hoenig & Kishimoto (2017). In this first paper we use synthetic spectra to
explore the discrimination between these models and under which circumstances
they allow to restrict the torus parameters, while our second paper analyzes
the best model to describe the mid-infrared spectroscopic data. We have
produced synthetic spectra from current instruments: GTC/CanariCam and Spitzer
/IRS and future JWST/MIRI and JWST/NIRSpec instruments. We find that for a
reasonable brightness (F12um > 100mJy) we can actually distinguish among models
except for the two pair of parent models. We show that these models can be
distinguished based on the continuum slopes and the strength of the silicate
features. Moreover, their parameters can be constrained within 15% of error,
irrespective of the instrument used, for all the models but Hoenig & Kishimoto
(2017). However, the parameter estimates are ruined when more than 50% of
circumnuclear contributors are included. Therefore, future high spatial
resolution spectra as those expected from JWST will provide enough coverage and
spatial resolution to tackle this topic.

We describe observations of UGC 1378 including deep spectroscopy with the

UGC 1378 has both high surface brightness and an extended low surface
brightness discs. Our stellar velocity dispersion data for the high-surface

merger, a widely discussed formation scenario for the very extended low surface
brightness disc. We estimate the star formation rates (SFR) from archival

We argue that the unusually large size of UGC 1378's disc may be the product of
a rich gas reservoir (e.g. a cosmic filament) and an isolated environment that

Here we perform spectral fitting of a sample of 110 AGN drawn from the
Swift/BAT survey with Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic data. The aim is to explore
which is the model that describes better the data and the resulting parameters.
The clumpy wind-disk model by Hoenig & Kishimoto (2017) provides good fits for
~50% of the sample, and the clumpy torus model by Nenkova et al. (2008B) is
good at describing ~30% of the objects. The wind-disk model by Hoenig &
Kishimoto (2017) is better for reproducing the mid-infrared spectra of Type-1
Seyferts while Type-2 Seyferts are equally fitted by both models. Large
residuals are found irrespective of the model used, indicating that the AGN
dust continuum emission is more complex than predicted by the models or that
the parameter space is not well sampled. We found that all the resulting
parameters for our AGN sample are roughly constrained to 10-20% of the
parameter space. The derived outer radius of the torus is smaller for the
smooth torus by Fritz et al. (2006) and the two phase torus by Stalevski et al.
(2016) than the one derived from the clumpy torus by (Nenkova et al. 2008B).
Covering factors and line-of-sight viewing angles strongly depend on the model
used. The total dust mass is the most robust derived quantity.

the source central position of the stacked cubes, the stacked line shows an
excess emission due to a broad component of 1.1-1.5 sigma, but the significance
drops to 0.4-0.7 sigma when stacking the extracted spectra from a smaller
region. The broad component can be characterised by a line width of full width
half max FWHM > 700 km/s. Furthermore, we find a sub-sample of 12 sources the

stellar mass. While this trend is the opposite to that predicted if the cluster
were developing energy equipartition, it is in agreement with recent N-body
simulations that find such a trend develops because of the Spitzer instability.
In these simulations the massive stars sink to the centre of the cluster and
form a self-gravitating system with a higher velocity dispersion. If the
cluster has formed by the cool collapse of an initially substructured
distribution then this occurs within 1-2 Myr, in agreement with our
observations of NGC 6530. We therefore conclude that NGC 6530 formed from much
more extended initial conditions and has since collapsed to form the cluster we

possibly at different times, have to meet at the same node and declare that
they have all met. Agents have different labels and move in synchronous rounds
along links of the network. The above task is known as gathering and was
traditionally considered under the assumption that when some agents are at the
same node then they can talk. In this paper we ask the question of whether this
ability of talking is needed for gathering. The answer turns out to be no.
  Our main contribution are two deterministic algorithms that always accomplish
gathering in a much weaker model. We only assume that at any time an agent
knows how many agents are at the node that it currently occupies but agents do
not see the labels of other co-located agents and cannot exchange any
information with them. They also do not see other nodes than the current one.
Our first algorithm works under the assumption that agents know a priori some
upper bound N on the network size, and it works in time polynomial in N and in
the length l of the smallest label. Our second algorithm does not assume any a
priori knowledge about the network but its complexity is exponential in the
network size and in the labels of agents. Its purpose is to show feasibility of
gathering under this harsher scenario.
  As a by-product of our techniques we obtain, in the same weak model, the
solution of the fundamental problem of leader election among agents. As an
application of our result we also solve, in the same model, the well-known
gossiping problem: if each agent has a message at the beginning, we show how to
make all messages known to all agents, even without any a priori knowledge
about the network. If agents know an upper bound N on the network size then our
gossiping algorithm works in time polynomial in N, in l and in the length of
the largest message.

generate correlation and lead to resonance. Despite their near-centuries-long
run of successes in signal analysis, here we show that flat power spectra can
be generated by highly complex processes, effectively hiding all inherent
structure in complex signals. Historically, this circumstance has been widely
misinterpreted, being taken as the renowned signature of ""structureless"" white
noise---the benchmark of randomness. We argue, in contrast, to the extent that
most real-world complex systems exhibit correlations beyond pairwise statistics
their structures evade power spectra and other pairwise statistical measures.

understanding complex mechanisms. First, we give the closed-form solution for

While precise two dimensional positional information is easy to obtain for

current and near future gravitational wave detectors is limited to between tens
and hundreds of square degrees, which makes it extremely challenging to
identify the host galaxies of gravitational wave events or to confidently
detect any electromagnetic counterparts. Gravitational wave observations
provide information on source properties and distances that is complementary to
the information in any associated electromagnetic emission and that is very
hard to obtain in any other way. Observing systems with multiple messengers
thus has scientific potential much greater than the sum of its parts. A
gravitational wave detector with higher angular resolution would significantly
increase the prospects for finding the hosts of gravitational wave sources and

transformative scientific potential. Precise positional information of standard
sirens would enable precision measurements of cosmological parameters and offer
new insights on structure formation; a high angular resolution gravitational
wave observatory would allow the detection of a stochastic background and
resolution of the anisotropies within it; it would also allow the study of

  This paper investigates the effects of longitudinal density stratification
along the loop axis, on the collective kinklike modes of system of coronal
loops. The coronal loops system is modeled as cylinders of parallel flux tubes,
with two ends of each loop at the dense photosphere. The flux tubes are
considered as uniform magnetic fields, with stratified density along the loop
axis which changes discontinuously at the lateral surface of each cylinder. The
MHD equations are reduced to solve a set of two coupled dispersion relations
for frequencies and wave numbers, in the presence of stratification parameter.
The fundamental and first overtone frequencies and longitudinal wave numbers
are computed. The previous results are verified for unstratified coronal loops
system.
  Finally we would conclude that increased longitudinal density stratification
parameter will result in increase of the frequencies. The frequencies ratios,
first overtones to fundamentals, are very sensitive functions of density scale
height parameter. Therefore, stratification should be included in dynamics of
coronal loops systems. For the unstratified coronal loops system, these ratios
are the same as monoloop ones.

better visibility among alternative technologies. Approach: We leverage social
contagion theory and statistical modeling to identify, define, and test
empirically measures that are likely to affect software adoption. More
specifically, we leverage a large collection of open source version control
repositories to construct a software dependency chain for a specific set of R
language source-code files. We formulate logistic regression models, to

them in the technical dependency network and in author collaborations networks

ballistic modes due to the existence of stable quasi-particles. We here
consider as an archetypical example for such a system the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
XXX Heisenberg chain that features magnons and their bound states. An
interesting question, which we here investigate numerically, arises with
respect to the fate of ballistic modes at finite temperatures in the limit of
zero magnetization $m{=}0$. At a finite magnetization density $m$, the spin
autocorrelation function $\Pi(x,t)$ (at high temperatures) typically exhibits a
trimodal behavior with left- and right-moving quasi-particle modes and a broad
center peak with slower dynamics. The broadening of the fastest propagating
modes exhibits a sub-diffusive $t^{1/3}$ scaling at large magnetization
densities, $m {\rightarrow} \frac{1}{2}$, familiar from non-interacting models;
it crosses over into a diffusive scaling $t^{1/2}$ upon decreasing the
magnetization to smaller values. The behavior of the center peak appears to
exhibit a crossover from transient super-diffusion to ballistic relaxation at
long times. In the limit $m{\to}0$, the weight carried by the propagating peaks
tends to zero; the residual dynamics is carried only by the central peak; it is
sub-ballistic and characterized by a dynamical exponent $z$ close to the value
$\frac{3}{2}$ familiar from Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling. We confirm,
employing elaborate finite-time extrapolations, that the spatial scaling of the
correlator $\Pi$ is in excellent agreement with KPZ-type behavior and analyze
the corresponding corrections.

preferential attachment in the BA model does not consider any stop against the
infinite growth of networks, we introduce a modified version of preferential
attachment of the BA model. This idea makes sense because the growth of real
networks may be finite. In the present study, by combining preferential
attachment in the science of temporal networks (interval graphs), and, the
first-order differential equations of value and cost of making links, the
future equilibrium of an evolving network is illustrated. During the process of
achieving a winning position, the variables against growth such as the
competition cost, besides the internally structural cost may emerge. In the
end, by applying this modified model, we found the circumstances in which a
trade-off between value and cost emerges.

used as the training set for the gazeNet algorithm, 2 were actually collected

even among the 500Hz data, the inter-timestamp intervals varied widely.
\underline{\textit{\textbf{Problem 2}}} is that there are many unusual
discontinuities in the saccade trajectories from the Lund University dataset
that make it a very poor choice for the construction of an automatic
classification method. \underline{\textit{\textbf{Error 2}}} The gazeNet
algorithm was trained on the Lund dataset, and then compared to other methods,
not trained on this dataset, in terms of performance on this dataset. This is
an inherently unfair comparison, and yet no where in the gazeNet paper is this
unfairness mentioned. \underline{\textit{\textbf{Error 3}}} arises out of the
novel event-related agreement analysis employed by the gazeNet authors.
Although the authors intended to classify unmatched events as either false
positives or false negatives, many are actually being classified as true
negatives. True negatives are not errors, and any unmatched event misclassified
as a true negative is actually driving kappa higher, whereas unmatched events
should be driving kappa lower.

objects in color images. Its main contribution is that it does not require any
training phases nor data for new objects, while state-of-the-art methods
typically require hours of training time and hundreds of training registered
images. Instead, our method relies only on the objects' geometries. Our method
focuses on objects with prominent corners, which covers a large number of
industrial objects. We first learn to detect object corners of various shapes
in images and also to predict their 3D poses, by using training images of a
small set of objects. To detect a new object in a given image, we first
identify its corners from its CAD model; we also detect the corners visible in
the image and predict their 3D poses. We then introduce a RANSAC-like algorithm
that robustly and efficiently detects and estimates the object's 3D pose by
matching its corners on the CAD model with their detected counterparts in the
image. Because we also estimate the 3D poses of the corners in the image,
detecting only 1 or 2 corners is sufficient to estimate the pose of the object,
which makes the approach robust to occlusions. We finally rely on a final check
that exploits the full 3D geometry of the objects, in case multiple objects
have the same corner spatial arrangement. The advantages of our approach make
it particularly attractive for industrial contexts, and we demonstrate our

but its numerical solution poses several challenges not encountered in the
corresponding Euclidean setting. These include the fact that the velocity
vector should be tangent to the given surface and the possible presence of
degenerate modes (Killing fields) in the solution. We analyze a surface finite
element method which provides solutions to these challenges. We consider an
interior penalty method based on the well-known Brezzi-Douglas-Marini $H({\rm
div})$-conforming finite element space. The resulting spaces are tangential to
the surface, but require penalization of jumps across element interfaces in
order to weakly maintain $H^1$ conformity of the velocity field. In addition
our method exactly satisfies the incompressibility constraint in the surface
Stokes problem. Secondly, we give a method which robustly filters Killing
fields out of the solution. This problem is complicated by the fact that the
dimension of the space of Killing fields may change with small perturbations of
the surface. We first approximate the Killing fields via a Stokes eigenvalue
problem and then give a method which is asymptotically guaranteed to correctly
exclude them from the solution. The properties of our method are rigorously
established via an error analysis and illustrated via numerical experiments.

we develop deep neural networks to stage sleep from ECG and respiratory
signals. Five deep neural networks consisting of convolutional networks and
long short-term memory networks are trained to stage sleep using heart and

combination with the abdominal respiratory effort achieve the best performance
for staging all five sleep stages with a Cohen's kappa of 0.600 (95% confidence

  Autoregressive Models via Union of Intersections","21 pages, 6 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are widely used for causal discovery and
forecasting in multivariate time series analyses in fields as diverse as
neuroscience, environmental science, and econometrics. In the high-dimensional
setting, model parameters are typically estimated by L1-regularized maximum
likelihood; yet, when applied to VAR models, this technique produces a sizable
trade-off between sparsity and bias with the choice of the regularization
hyperparameter, and thus between causal discovery and prediction. That is,
low-bias estimation entails dense parameter selection, and sparse selection
entails increased bias; the former is useful in forecasting but less likely to
yield scientific insight leading to discovery of causal influences, and
conversely for the latter. This paper presents a scalable algorithm for
simultaneous low-bias and low-variance estimation (hence good prediction) with
sparse selection for high-dimensional VAR models. The method leverages the
recently developed Union of Intersections (UoI) algorithmic framework for
flexible, modular, and scalable feature selection and estimation that allows
control of false discovery and false omission in feature selection while
maintaining low bias and low variance. This paper demonstrates the superior
performance of the UoI-VAR algorithm compared with other methods in simulation
studies, exhibits its application in data analysis, and illustrates its good
algorithmic scalability in multi-node distributed memory implementations.

for performing uncertainty propagation in systems composed of interconnected
components. The method assumes the existence of a collection of components,
each of which is characterized by exogenous-input random variables,
endogenous-input random variables, output random variables, and a local
uncertainty-propagation operator that computes output random variables from
input random variables. The method assembles the full-system network by
connecting components, which is achieved simply by associating endogenous-input
random variables for each component with output random variables from other
components; no other inter-component compatibility conditions are required. The
network uncertainty-propagation problem is: Compute output random variables for
all components given all exogenous-input random variables. To solve this
problem, the method applies classical relaxation methods (i.e., Jacobi and
Gauss--Seidel iteration with Anderson acceleration), which require only
black-box evaluations of component uncertainty-propagation operators. Compared
with other available methods, this approach is applicable to any network
topology, promotes component independence by enabling components to employ
tailored uncertainty-propagation operators, supports general functional
representations of random variables, and requires no offline preprocessing
stage. Also, because the method propagates functional representations of random
variables throughout the network (and not, e.g., probability density
functions), the joint distribution of any set of random variables throughout
the network can be estimated a posteriori in a straightforward manner. We
perform supporting convergence and error analysis and execute numerical
experiments that demonstrate the weak- and strong-scaling performance of the
method.

on a graph $G$. Initially, all cops occupy some vertices in $G$ and the robber
occupies another vertex. In each round, a cop can move to one of its neighbors
or stay idle, after which the robber does the same. The robber is caught by a
cop if the cop lands on the same vertex which is currently occupied by the
robber. The minimum number of cops needed to guarantee capture of a robber on
$G$ is called the {\em cop number} of $G$, denoted by $c(G)$. We say a family
$\cal F$ of graphs is {\em cop-bounded} if there is a constant $M$ so that
$c(G)\leq M$ for every graph $G\in \cal F$. Joret, Kamin\'nski, and Theis
[Contrib. Discrete Math. 2010] proved that the class of all graphs not
containing a graph $H$ as an induced subgraph is cop-bounded if and only if $H$
is a linear forest; morerover, $C(G)\leq k-2$ if if $G$ is induced-$P_k$-free
for $k\geq 3$. In this paper, we consider the cop number of a family of graphs
forbidding certain two graphs and generalized some previous results.

method to provide real-time probabilistic forecasts of future parking
occupancy. The queuing model has a non-homogeneous arrival rate and
time-varying service time distribution. All statistical assumptions of the
model are verified using data from 29 truck parking locations, each with
between 55 and 299 parking spots. For each location and each spot the data
specifies the arrival and departure times of a truck, for 16 months of
operation. The modeling framework presented in this paper provides empirical
support for queuing models adopted in many theoretical studies and policy
designs. We discuss how our framework can be used to study parking problems in
different environments. Based on the queuing model, we propose two prediction
methods, a microscopic method and a macroscopic method, that provide a
real-time probabilistic forecast of parking occupancy for an arbitrary forecast
horizon. These model-based methods convert a probabilistic forecast problem
into a parameter estimation problem that can be tackled using classical
estimation methods such as regressions or pure machine learning algorithms. We
characterize a lower bound for an arbitrary real-time prediction algorithm. We
evaluate the performance of these methods using the truck data comparing the
outcomes of their implementations with other model-based and model-free methods

Kelvin's circulation theorem for ideal fluids. In these models, the velocity
field is randomly transported by white-noise vector fields, as well as by its
own average over realizations of this noise. We call these systems the
Lagrangian averaged stochastic advection by Lie transport (LA SALT) equations.
These equations are nonlinear and non-local, in both physical and probability
space. Before taking this average, the equations recover the Stochastic
Advection by Lie Transport (SALT) fluid equations introduced by Holm (2015).
Remarkably, the introduction of the non-locality in probability space in the
form of momentum transported by its own mean velocity gives rise to a closed
equation for the expectation field which comprises Navier--Stokes equations
with Lie--Laplacian ""dissipation"". As such, this form of non-locality provides
a regularization mechanism. The formalism we develop is closely connected to
the stochastic Weber velocity framework of Constantin and Iyer (2008) in the
case when the noise correlates are taken to be the constant basis vectors in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ and, thus, the Lie--Laplacian reduces to the usual Laplacian. We
extend this class of equations to allow for advected quantities to be present
and affect the flow through exchange of kinetic and potential energies. The
statistics of the solutions for the LA SALT fluid equations are found to be
changing dynamically due to an array of intricate correlations among the
physical variables. The statistical properties of the LA SALT physical
variables propagate as local evolutionary equations which when spatially
integrated become dynamical equations for the variances of the fluctuations.
Essentially, the LA SALT theory is a non-equilibrium stochastic linear response
theory for fluctuations in SALT fluids with advected quantities.

Due to the random behavior of load and renewable energy, stochastic programming
becomes a useful technique to optimize power systems. Thus, scenario reduction
gets more attentions in recent years. Many scenario reduction methods have been
proposed to reduce the scenario set in a fast speed. However, the speed of
scenario reduction is still very slow, in which it takes at least several
seconds to several minutes to finish the reduction. This limitation of speed
prevents stochastic programming to be implemented in real-time optimal control
problems. In this paper, a fast scenario reduction method based on deep
learning is proposed to solve this problem. Inspired by the deep learning based
image process, recognition and generation methods, the scenario data are
transformed into a 2D image-like data and then to be fed into a deep
convolutional neural network (DCNN). The output of the DCNN will be an ""image""
of the reduced scenario set. Since images can be processed in a very high speed
by neural networks, the scenario reduction by neural network can also be very
fast. The results of the simulation show that the scenario reduction with the
proposed DCNN method can be completed in very high speed.

Our result also exhibits an interesting phenomenon: while in the classical

large surveys with high number densities of galaxies enable tomographic peak

tomographic redshift binning can enhance the cosmological gains. We also
perform detailed studies about the degradation of cosmological information due
to photometric redshift (photo-z) errors. We show that for surveys with the
number density of galaxies $\sim40\,{\rm arcmin^{-2}}$, the median redshift
$\sim1$, and the survey area of $\sim15000\,{\rm deg^{2}}$, the 4-bin
tomographic peak analyses can reduce the error contours of $(\Omega_{{\rm

case of photo-z error being absent. More redshift bins can hardly lead to
significantly better constraints. The photo-z error model here is parametrized
by $z_{{\rm bias}}$ and $\sigma_{{\rm ph}}$ and the fiducial values of $z_{{\rm
bias}}=0.003$ and $\sigma_{{\rm ph}}=0.02$ is taken. We find that using
tomographic peak analyses can constrain the photo-z errors simultaneously with
cosmological parameters. For 4-bin analyses, we can obtain $\sigma(z_{{\rm

constraints on $\Omega_{{\rm m}}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ degrade by a factor of
$\sim2.2$ and $\sim1.8$, respectively, with respect to zero uncertainties on

data in unseen domain, relation modeling between seen and unseen domains is
vital for knowledge transfer in these tasks. Most existing methods capture
seen-unseen relation implicitly via semantic embedding or feature generation,
resulting in inadequate use of relation and some issues remain (e.g. domain
shift). To tackle these challenges, we propose a Transferable Graph Generation
(TGG) approach, in which the relation is modeled and utilized explicitly via
graph generation. Specifically, our proposed TGG contains two main components:
(1) Graph generation for relation modeling. An attention-based aggregate
network and a relation kernel are proposed, which generate instance-level graph
based on a class-level prototype graph and visual features. Proximity
information aggregating is guided by a multi-head graph attention mechanism,
where seen and unseen features synthesized by GAN are revised as node
embeddings. The relation kernel further generates edges with GCN and graph
kernel method, to capture instance-level topological structure while tackling
data imbalance and noise. (2) Relation propagation for relation utilization. A
dual relation propagation approach is proposed, where relations captured by the
generated graph are separately propagated from the seen and unseen subgraphs.
The two propagations learn from each other in a dual learning fashion, which
performs as an adaptation way for mitigating domain shift. All components are
jointly optimized with a meta-learning strategy, and our TGG acts as an
end-to-end framework unifying conventional zero-shot, generalized zero-shot and
few-shot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it consistently
surpasses existing methods of the above three fields by a significant margin.

our ignorance about the true cosmology is parameterised in terms of two
constant AP scaling parameters. We propose a new, and as it turns out, improved
version of the constant AP scaling, also consisting of two scaling parameters.
  The two constant AP scaling methods are almost indistinguishable when the
fiducial model used in data reduction and the ""true"" underlying cosmology are
not differing substantially in terms of metric gradients, but are otherwise
expected to differ. Our new methods can be applied to existing analyses through
a reinterpretation of the results of the conventional AP scaling. This
reinterpretation might be important in model universes where curvature
gradients above the scale of galaxies are significant.
  We test our theoretical findings on $\Lambda$CDM mock catalogues. The
conventional constant AP scaling methods are surprisingly successful for pairs
of large-scale metrics, but eventually break down when toy models allowing for
large metric gradients are tested. The new constant AP scaling methods proposed
in this paper are efficient for all test models examined. We find systematic
errors of ~1% in the recovery of the BAO scale when the true model is distant
from the fiducial, which cannot be attributed to any constant AP approximation.
The level of systematic uncertainty is robust to the exact fitting method
employed. This indicates that caution must be taken with the error budget when
extrapolating the BAO acoustic scale measurements obtained in the standard
literature.

  FastRP is proposed as a scalable algorithm for network embeddings. Two key
features of FastRP are: 1) it explicitly constructs a node similarity matrix
that captures transitive relationships in a graph and normalizes matrix entries
based on node degrees; 2) it utilizes very sparse random projection, which is a
scalable optimization-free method for dimension reduction. An extra benefit
from combining these two design choices is that it allows the iterative
computation of node embeddings so that the similarity matrix need not be

advantageous for its ease of implementation, parallelization and hyperparameter
tuning. The source code is available at https://github.com/GTmac/FastRP.

different network structures and properties in low-dimensional embedding
vectors, while neglecting the existence of noisy information in many real-world
networks and the overfitting issue in the embedding learning process. Most
recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) based regularization methods
are exploited to regularize embedding learning process, which can encourage a
global smoothness of embedding vectors. These methods have very complicated
architecture and suffer from the well-recognized non-convergence problem of
GANs. In this paper, we aim to introduce a more succinct and effective local
regularization method, namely adversarial training, to network embedding so as
to achieve model robustness and better generalization performance. Firstly, the
adversarial training method is applied by defining adversarial perturbations in
the embedding space with an adaptive $L_2$ norm constraint that depends on the
connectivity pattern of node pairs. Though effective as a regularizer, it
suffers from the interpretability issue which may hinder its application in
certain real-world scenarios. To improve this strategy, we further propose an
interpretable adversarial training method by enforcing the reconstruction of
the adversarial examples in the discrete graph domain. These two regularization
methods can be applied to many existing embedding models, and we take DeepWalk
as the base model for illustration in the paper. Empirical evaluations in both
link prediction and node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the

steps needed to find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point. When the constraint
functions are convex, we show a complexity result of $\tilde
O(\varepsilon^{-5/2})$ to produce an $\varepsilon$-stationary point under the
Slater's condition. When the constraint functions are non-convex, the
complexity becomes $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-3})$ if a non-singularity condition
holds on constraints and otherwise $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ if a feasible
initial solution is available.

input text to output acoustic features using a single network. A recent advance
of end-to-end TTS is due to a key technique called attention mechanisms, and
all successful methods proposed so far have been based on soft attention
mechanisms. However, although network structures are becoming increasingly
complex, end-to-end TTS systems with soft attention mechanisms may still fail
to learn and to predict accurate alignment between the input and output. This
may be because the soft attention mechanisms are too flexible. Therefore, we
propose an approach that has more explicit but natural constraints suitable for
speech signals to make alignment learning and prediction of end-to-end TTS
systems more robust. The proposed system, with the constrained alignment scheme
borrowed from segment-to-segment neural transduction (SSNT), directly
calculates the joint probability of acoustic features and alignment given an
input text. The alignment is designed to be hard and monotonically increase by
considering the speech nature, and it is treated as a latent variable and
marginalized during training. During prediction, both the alignment and
acoustic features can be generated from the probabilistic distributions. The
advantages of our approach are that we can simplify many modules for the soft
attention and that we can train the end-to-end TTS model using a single
likelihood function. As far as we know, our approach is the first end-to-end
TTS without a soft attention mechanism.

  We extend the SAT model to jointly infer not only entities and their

restrict inferring relations between tokens within a few neighboring sentences,
mainly to avoid high computational complexity. In contrast, our proposed
Relation-SAT (R-SAT) model is computationally efficient and can infer relations

processor consumption which makes all these security protocols unsuitable for
resource constrained platforms such as Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain
(BC) finds its efficient application in IoT platform to preserve the five basic
cryptographic primitives, such as confidentiality, authenticity, integrity,
availability and non-repudiation. Conventional adoption of BC in IoT platform
causes high energy consumption, delay and computational overhead which are not
appropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. This work proposes a
machine learning (ML) based smart access control framework in a public and a
private BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient as
compared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city
architecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security
and privacy issues. Moreover, BC has very minimal overhead on IoT platform as
well. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access
control issues which handle multiple permissions of various nodes and detects
relevant inconsistencies to notify the corresponding nodes. Comparison in terms
of all security issues with existing literature shows that the proposed
architecture is competitively efficient in terms of security access control.

with its size $P$. For most complex systems it is of the form $Y\sim P^\beta$
with a nontrivial value of the exponent $\beta$, usually determined by
regression methods. The presence of noise can make it difficult to conclude
about the existence of a non-linear behavior with $\beta\neq 1$ and we propose
here to circumvent fitting problems by investigating how two different systems
of sizes $P_1$ and $P_2$ are related to each other. This leads us to define a
local scaling exponent $\beta_{\mathrm{loc}}$ that we study versus the ratio
$P_2/P_1$ and provides some sort of `tomography scan' of scaling across
different values of the size ratio, allowing us to assess the relevance of
nonlinearity in the system and to identify an effective exponent that minimizes
the error for predicting the value of $Y$. We illustrate this method on various
real-world datasets for cities and show that our method reinforces in some
cases the standard analysis, but is also able to provide new insights in
inconclusive cases and to detect problems in the scaling form such as the
absence of a single scaling exponent or the presence of threshold effects.

that the upward motion of the jet occurs under the influence of pressure

gravitational free fall, but also due to the complex plasma motions near its
base under the effect of counter propagating pulses. Maximum height and
life-time of the jets w.r.t. the strength of the pressure pulse show a linear
increasing trend. This suggests that if the extent of the heating and thus
pressure perturbations will be longer then more longer chromospheric jets can
be triggered from the same location in the chromosphere. For the certain
amplitude of pressure pulse, the strong magnetic field configuration (B=112
Gauss) leads more longer jet compared to the weaker field (B=56 Gauss). This
suggests that the strong magnetic field guides the pressure pulse driven jets
more efficiency towards the higher corona. In conclusion, our model mimics the
properties and evolution of variety of the cool impulsive jets in the
chromosphere (e.g., macrospicules, network jets, isolated repeated cool jets,
confined \& small surges etc).

range of metallicities, halo concentration parameters and galaxy masses studied
here. Furthermore, we find including gradual feedback in the smallest galaxies
delays the unbinding of the majority of the gas and facilitates the production
of `chimneys' in the dense shell surrounding the feedback generated hot,
pressurised `superbubble'. These `chimneys' vent hot gas from the galaxy
interior, lowering the temperature of the central 10 kpc of the gaseous halo.
Additionally, we find radiative cooling has little effect on the energetics of
simulations that include a short, violent starburst compared with those that
have a longer, less concentrated starburst. Finally, we investigate the
relative impact of HMXB feedback and stellar winds on our results, finding the
ubiquity of stellar winds throughout each starburst makes them a defining

The sample includes Crab and Crab twin, for which the spectra extends even to

just three physical parameters and a global scaling-- can fit the observations
well across eight orders of magnitude for 18 of the 36 pulsars studied.
Additionally, we find a set of 8 pulsars for which the model still provides

interpretations for a simple model extension (related to the geometry of the
accelerating system with regards to the observer) that allows dealing with all

model is still austere, adding only two additional parameters to the former
set, of the same kind of the ones previously used. We use these fits to discuss
issues going from the observed spectral origin, to the extent of the dominance
of synchrotron or curvature regimes, the use of a model as predictor for

formulated in the language of symmetric functions. The main objects in this
theory are two generating functions, which are related to each other by the
involution that exchanges an irreducible representation with its conjugate.
Both of them contain all information about the Wilson loops in arbitrary
representations as well as the correlators of multiply-wound Wilson loops. This
general framework is combined with the results of the Gaussian matrix model,
which calculates the expectation values of $1/2$-BPS circular Wilson loops in
$\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory. General, explicit, formulas for the
connected correlators of multiply-wound Wilson loops in terms of the traces of
symmetrized matrix products are obtained, as well as their inverses. It is
shown that the generating functions for Wilson loops in mutually conjugate
representations are related by a duality relation whenever they can be
calculated by a Hermitian matrix model.

information, debate, and form their opinions. Recent studies, indeed, showed
that users online tend to promote their favored narratives and thus to form
polarized groups around a common system of beliefs. Confirmation bias helps to
account for users decisions about whether to spread content, thus creating
informational cascades within identifiable communities. At the same time,
aggregation of favored information within those communities reinforces
selective exposure and group polarization. Along this path, through a thorough
quantitative analysis we approach connectivity patterns over 1.2M of Facebook
users engaged with two very conflicting narratives: scientific and conspiracy
news. Analyzing such data, we quantitatively investigate the effect of two
mechanisms (namely challenge avoidance and reinforcement seeking) behind
confirmation bias, one of the major drivers of human behavior in social media.
We find that challenge avoidance mechanism triggers the emergence of two
distinct and polarized groups of users (i.e., echo chambers) who also tend to
be surrounded by friends having similar systems of beliefs. Through a network
based approach, we show how the reinforcement seeking mechanism limits the
influence of neighbors and primarily drives the selection and diffusion of
contents even among like-minded users, thus fostering the formation of highly
polarized sub-clusters within the same echo chamber. Finally, we show that
polarized users reinforce their preexisting beliefs by leveraging the activity
of their like-minded neighbors, and this trend grows with the user engagement
suggesting how peer influence acts as a support for reinforcement seeking.

experiment, in which the control force needed to compensate the quasistatic
differential force acting on two test masses is applied intermittently as a
series of ""impulse"" forces lasting a few seconds and separated by roughly 350 s
periods of true free fall. This represents an alternative to the normal LPF
mode of operation in which this balancing force is applied continuously, with
the advantage that the acceleration noise during free fall is measured in the
absence of the actuation force, thus eliminating associated noise and force
calibration errors. The differential acceleration noise measurement presented
here with the free-fall mode agrees with noise measured with the continuous
actuation scheme, representing an important and independent confirmation of the
LPF result. An additional measurement with larger actuation forces also shows
that the technique can be used to eliminate actuation noise when this is a
dominant factor.

disconnected sub-maps, that includes a robust map merging algorithm able to
detect sub-maps with common regions and seamlessly fuse them. The outstanding
robustness and accuracy of ORBSLAM are due to its ability to detect
wide-baseline matches between keyframes, and to exploit them by means of
non-linear optimization, however it only can handle a single map. ORBSLAM-Atlas
brings the wide-baseline matching detection and exploitation to the multiple
map arena. The result is a SLAM system significantly more general and robust,
able to perform multi-session mapping. If tracking is lost during exploration,
instead of freezing the map, a new sub-map is launched, and it can be fused
with the previous map when common parts are visited. Our criteria to declare
the camera lost contrast with previous approaches that simply count the number
of tracked points, we propose to discard also inaccurately estimated camera
poses due to bad geometrical conditioning. As a result, the map is split into
more accurate sub-maps, that are eventually merged in a more accurate global
map, thanks to the multi-mapping capabilities.
  We provide extensive experimental validation in the EuRoC datasets, where
ORBSLAM-Atlas obtains accurate monocular and stereo results in the difficult
sequences where ORBSLAM failed. We also build global maps after multiple
sessions in the same room, obtaining the best results to date, between 2 and 3
times more accurate than competing multi-map approaches. We also show the
robustness and capability of our system to deal with dynamic scenes,
quantitatively in the EuRoC datasets and qualitatively in a densely populated
corridor where camera occlusions and tracking losses are frequent.

It is hitherto performed by human experts and thus, hard to scale. To address
this problem, we propose WundtBackpack, an algorithmic approach to generate
storylines based on available visual materials, which can be video clips or

the perceived persuasiveness based on the stimulus intensity of a sequence of
visual materials, which only requires a small volume of data to train; and 2) a
clustering-based backpacking algorithm to generate persuasive sequences of
visual materials while considering video length constraints. In this way, the
proposed approach provides a dynamic structure to empower artificial
intelligence (AI) to organize video footage in order to construct a sequence of
visual stimuli with persuasive power. Extensive real-world experiments show
that our approach achieves close to 10% higher perceived persuasiveness scores

nanodroplet isolation spectroscopy operate at very low temperatures in order to
investigate hydrogen bonding. To elucidate the differences between such
ultra-cold and usual ambient conditions, different hydrogen bonded systems are
studied systematically from 300 K down to about 1 K using path integral
simulations that explicitly consider both, the quantum nature of the nuclei and
thermal fluctuations. For that purpose, finite sized water clusters,
specifically the water dimer and hexamer, protonated water clusters including
the Zundel and Eigen complexes, as well as hexagonal ice as a condensed phase
representative are compared directly as a function of temperature. While weaker
hydrogen bonds, as present in the neutral systems, show distinct structural
differences between ambient conditions and the ultra-cold regime, the stronger
hydrogen bonds of the protonated water clusters are less perturbed by
temperature compared to their quantum ground state. In all studied systems, the
quantum delocalization of the nuclei is found to vary drastically with
temperature. Interestingly, upon reaching temperatures of about 1 K, the
spatial quantum delocalization of the heavy oxygens approaches that of the
protons for relatively weak spatial constraints, and even significantly exceeds
the latter in case of the centered hydrogen bond in the Zundel complex. These
findings are relevant for comparisons between experiments on hydrogen bonding
carried out at ultra-cold versus ambient conditions as well as to understand
quantum delocalization phenomena of nuclei by seamlessly extending our insights
into noncovalent interactions down to ultra-low temperatures.

fault-proneness, considering also the type of TD items and their severity.
Method. We conducted a case study among 33 Java projects from the Apache
Software Foundation (ASF) repository. We analyzed 726 commits containing 27K
faults and 12M changes. The projects violated 173 SonarQube rules generating
more than 95K TD items in more than 200K classes. Results. Clean classes
(classes not affected by TD items) are less change-prone than dirty ones, but
the difference between the groups is small. Clean classes are slightly more
change-prone than classes affected by TD items of type Code Smell or Security
Vulnerability. As for fault-proneness, there is no difference between clean and
dirty classes. Moreover, we found a lot of incongruities in the type and
severity level assigned by SonarQube. Conclusions. Our result can be useful for
practitioners to understand which TD items they should refactor and for
researchers to bridge the missing gaps. They can also support companies and
tool vendors in identifying TD items as accurately as possible.

responses with respect to functional inputs. However, classical functional
linear regression models can be severely affected by outliers. We therefore
introduce a Fisher-consistent robust functional linear regression model that is
able to effectively fit data in the presence of outliers. The model is built
using robust functional principal component and least squares regression
estimators. The performance of the functional linear regression model depends
on the number of principal components used. We therefore introduce a consistent
robust model selection procedure to choose the number of principal components.
Our robust functional linear regression model can be used alongside an outlier
detection procedure to effectively identify abnormal functional responses. A
simulation study shows our method is able to effectively capture the regression
behaviour in the presence of outliers, and is able to find the outliers with
high accuracy. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on jet engine sensor
data. We identify outliers that would not be found if the functional responses
were modelled independently of the functional input, or using non-robust
methods.

However, in practice, sounds from multiple sources are often mixed together. In
this paper we propose a novel framework, referred to as MinusPlus Network

recursively in the order of average energy, removing the separated sound from
the mixture at the end of each prediction, until the mixture becomes empty or
contains only noise. In this way, MP-Net could be applied to sound mixtures
with arbitrary numbers and types of sounds. Moreover, while MP-Net keeps
removing sounds with large energy from the mixture, sounds with small energy
could emerge and become clearer, so that the separation is more accurate.
Compared to previous methods, MP-Net obtains state-of-the-art results on two
large scale datasets, across mixtures with different types and numbers of
sounds.

address these challenges, we propose a novel lip-reading model which captures

obtain discriminative representations for words with similar phonemes. Next, a
bidirectional ConvLSTM augmented with temporal attention aggregates
spatio-temporal information in the entire input sequence, which is expected to

various conditions in speaker identity, lighting conditions, and so on. By
making full use of the information from different levels in a unified

s-wave superconductor into a topological regime which supports Majorana end
states. However, a magnetic field generally suppresses the proximity
superconducting gap induced on the nanowire. In recent experiments using InSb
nanowires coupled to Al, the induced proximity gap vanishes at magnetic fields
B~1T. This results in a small superconducting gap on the wire and a narrow
topological regime which is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.
In this work, we show that by placing nanowires in proximity to recently
discovered Ising superconductors such as the atomically thin transition-metal
dichalcogenide(TMD) NbSe2, the topological superconducting gap on the wire can
maintain at a large magnetic field as strong as B~10T. This robust topological
superconducting gap is induced by the unique equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs of
the parent Ising superconductor. The strong magnetic field allows a topological
regime ten times larger than those in InSb wires coupled to Al. Our work
establishes a realistic platform for building robust Majorana-based qubits.

dielectric anomaly at TN1 whose magnitude increases with field, which results
in significant (1.7%) magnetocapacitance effect. On the other hand, the
dielectric anomaly observed in zero-applied magnetic field at TN2 shows a small
(0.4%) magnetocapacitance effect. Interestingly, applied magnetic field induces
an electric polarization below TN1 and the polarization varies linearly up to

fractional Brownian motion. To increase the resolution, an initial coarse
lattice is successively refined close to the target, by adding exactly sampled
midpoints, where the probability that they reach the target is non-negligible.
Compared to a path of $N$ equally spaced points, the algorithm achieves the
same numerical accuracy $N_{\rm eff}$, while sampling only a small fraction of
all points. Though this induces a statistical error, the latter is bounded for
each bridge, allowing us to bound the total error rate by a number of our
choice, say $P_{\rm error}^{\rm tot}=10^{-6}$. This leads to significant
improvements in both memory and speed. For $H=0.33$ and $N_{\rm eff}=2^{32}$,
we need $5\,000$ times less CPU time and $10\, 000$ times less memory than the
classical Davies Harte algorithm. The gain grows for $H=0.25$ and $N_{\rm eff}
= 2^{42}$ to $3\cdot 10^{5}$ for CPU and $10^6$ for memory. We estimate our
algorithmic complexity as ${\cal C}^{\rm ABSec}(N_{\rm eff}) = {\cal
O}\left(\left( \ln N_{\rm eff}\right)^{3}\right)$, to be compared to Davies
Harte which has complexity ${\cal C}^{\rm DH}(N) = {\cal O}\left(N \ln N
\right)$. Decreasing $P_{\rm error}^{\rm tot}$ results in a small increase in
complexity, proportional to $\ln (1/P_{\rm error}^{\rm tot})$. Our current
implementation is limited to the values of $N_{\rm eff}$ given above, due to a
loss of floating-point precision. The algorithm can be adapted to other extreme
events and arbitrary Gaussian processes. It enables one to numerically validate
theoretical predictions that were hitherto inaccessible.

extraction from text as a function that maps every document (a string) into a
relation over the document's spans (intervals identified by their start and end

Relational Algebra (RA) of the regular expressions with capture variables, and
the expressive power of the regular spanners is precisely captured by the class
of VSet-automata -- a restricted class of transducers that mark the endpoints
of selected spans.
  In this work, we embark on the investigation of document spanners that can
annotate extractions with auxiliary information such as confidence, support,
and confidentiality measures. To this end, we adopt the abstraction of
provenance semirings by Green et al., where tuples of a relation are annotated
with the elements of a commutative semiring, and where the annotation
propagates through the positive RA operators via the semiring operators. Hence,
the proposed spanner extension, referred to as an annotator, maps every string
into an annotated relation over the spans. As a specific instantiation, we
explore weighted VSet-automata that, similarly to weighted automata and
transducers, attach semiring elements to transitions. We investigate key
aspects of expressiveness, such as the closure under the positive RA, and key
aspects of computational complexity, such as the enumeration of annotated
answers and their ranked enumeration in the case of ordered semirings. For a
number of these problems, fundamental properties of the underlying semiring,
such as positivity, are crucial for establishing tractability.

very same FN concept to construct a quantitative microscopic theory of empty
perovskites, a family of crystals with ReO$_3$ structure, which exhibit a
number of unusual properties. One remarkable example is ScF$_3$, which shows a
near-zero-temperature structural instability and large negative thermal
expansion (NTE). We trace these effects to an FN-like crystalline architecture
formed by strong nearest-neighbor bonds, which is stabilized by net
electrostatic repulsion that plays a role similar to osmotic pressure in
polymeric gels. NTE in these crystalline solids, which we conceptualize as
Coulomb Floppy Networks, emerges from the tension effect of Coulomb repulsion
combined with the FN's entropic elasticity, and has the same physical origin as
in gels and rubber. Our theory provides an accurate, quantitative description
of phonons, thermal expansion, compressibility, and structural phase diagram,
all in excellent agreement with experiments. The entropic stabilization of
critical soft modes, which play only a secondary role in NTE, explains the
observed phase diagram. Significant entropic elasticity resolves the puzzle of
a marked, $\approx$50\% discrepancy between the experimentally observed bulk
modulus and ab initio calculations. The Coulomb FN approach is potentially
applicable to other important materials with markedly covalent bonds, from
perovskite oxides to iron chalcogenides, whose anomalous vibrational and

each generator to improve frequency synchronization within the power grid. We
propose different realizations of the communication layer topology and
different ways to calculate the control signal. Then we conduct a systematic
survey of the two-layer system against a multitude of different realistic
perturbation scenarios, such as disconnecting generators, increasing demand of
consumers, or generators with stochastic power output. When using a control

parameters to the observed data. With transdimensional inversion algorithms
such as the reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC), it is possible
to vary this number during the inversion and to interpret the observations in a
more flexible way. Geoscience imaging applications use this behaviour to
automatically adjust model resolution to the inhomogeneities of the
investigated system, while keeping the model parameters on an optimal level.
The rjMCMC algorithm produces an ensemble as result, a set of model
realizations which together represent the posterior probability distribution of
the investigated problem. The realizations are evolved via sequential updates
from a randomly chosen initial solution, and converge toward the target
posterior distribution of the inverse problem. Up to a point in the chain, the
realizations may be strongly biased by the initial model, and have to be
discarded from the final ensemble. With convergence assessment techniques, this
point in the chain can be identified. Transdimensional MCMC methods produce
ensembles which are not suitable for classic convergence assessment techniques
because of the changes in parameter numbers. To overcome this hurdle, three
solutions are introduced to convert model realizations to a common
dimensionality while maintaining the statistical characteristics of the
ensemble. A scalar, a vector and a matrix representation for models is
presented, inferred from tomographic subsurface investigations, and three
classic convergence assessment techniques are applied on them. It is shown that
appropriately chosen scalar conversions of the models could retain similar
statistical ensemble properties as geologic projections created by
rasterization.

first time, we carried out laboratory collision experiments with hot levitated
basalt dust aggregates of $1\, \rm mm$ in size. The aggregates are compact with
a filling factor of $0.37 \pm 0.06$. The constituent grains have a wide size

the projected alignment signal of all galaxies with resolved shapes with

giving similar predictions for contamination to weak lensing. The relative

superconductivity emerges at ~15 GPa, with the onset critical temperature (Tc)

  (ICDM'19)",,,,"cs.LG cs.DB cs.IT math.IT stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In many scientific tasks we are interested in discovering whether there exist
any correlations in our data. This raises many questions, such as how to
reliably and interpretably measure correlation between a multivariate set of
attributes, how to do so without having to make assumptions on distribution of
the data or the type of correlation, and, how to efficiently discover the
top-most reliably correlated attribute sets from data. In this paper we answer
these questions for discovery tasks in categorical data.
  In particular, we propose a corrected-for-chance, consistent, and efficient
estimator for normalized total correlation, by which we obtain a reliable,
naturally interpretable, non-parametric measure for correlation over
multivariate sets. For the discovery of the top-k correlated sets, we derive an
effective algorithmic framework based on a tight bounding function. This
framework offers exact, approximate, and heuristic search. Empirical evaluation
shows that already for small sample sizes the estimator leads to low-regret
optimization outcomes, while the algorithms are shown to be highly effective
for both large and high-dimensional data. Through two case studies we confirm
that our discovery framework identifies interesting and meaningful
correlations.

whose prime spectrum of ideals (or filters), endowed with the Stone topology,
is homeomorphic to the prime spectrum of congruences of $A$, with its own Stone

transferred between the algebra $A$ and bounded distributive lattices, a
transfer which is facilitated if we can define a {\em reticulation functor}
from a variety containing $A$ to the variety of (bounded) distributive

universal algebra initiated in \cite{retic}, where we have used the notion of a
prime congruence introduced through the term condition commutator. We
characterize morphisms which admit an image through the reticulation and
investigate the kinds of varieties that admit reticulation functors; we prove
that these include semi--degenerate congruence--distributive varieties with the
Compact Intersection Property and semi--degenerate congruence--distributive
varieties with congruence intersection terms, as well as generalizations of
these, and additional varietal properties ensure that the reticulation functors
preserve the injectivity of morphisms. We also study the property of morphisms
of having an image through the reticulation in relation to another property,
involving the complemented elements of congruence lattices, exemplify the
transfer of properties through the reticulation with conditions Going Up, Going
Down, Lying Over and the Congruence Boolean Lifting Property, and illustrate
the applicability of such a transfer by using it to derive results for certain
types of varieties from properties of bounded distributive lattices.

We produce a multifrequency catalog of radio source positions with full
variance-covariance information across all radio source positions of all input
catalogs. Methods. We combined three catalogs, one observed at 8 GHz (X band),
one at 24 GHz (K band) and one at 32 GHz (Ka band). Rather than only using the
radio source positions, we developed a new, rigorous combination approach by
carrying over the full covariance information through the process of adding
normal equation systems. Special validation routines were used to characterize
the random and systematic errors between the input reference frames and the
combined catalog. Results. The resulting CRF contains precise positions of 4617
compact radio astronomical objects, 4536 measured at 8 Ghz, 824 sources also
observed at 24 GHz, and 674 at 32 GHz. The frame is aligned with ICRF3 within 3

Next, for each of these priority possibilities, we establish a nonconvex

to have the same optimal profits, allowing for efficient computation of

current can switch the direction of the magnetization. This offers the prospect
of realizing low energy dissipation magnetic memories. However, the mechanism
of the current-driven magnetization switching is poorly understood as the
charge currents in graphene layers are generally believed to be non-magnetic.
In this work, we demonstrate that, in TBGs, the twist-induced reduction of
lattice symmetry allows a charge current to generate net orbital magnetization
at a general filling factor through magnetoelectric effects. Substrate-induced
strain and sublattice symmetry breaking further reduce the symmetry such that
an out-of-plane orbital magnetization can be generated. Due to the large
non-trivial Berry phase of the flat bands, the orbital magnetization of a Bloch
state can be as large as tens of Bohr magnetons and therefore a small current
would be sufficient to generate a large orbital magnetization. We further
demonstrate how the charge current with orbital magnetization can switch the
magnetization of the quantum anomalous Hall state near 3/4 filling as observed
in the experiments [1, 2].

theoretically predict that such a quantum point contact, in the presence of a
time periodic applied electric field, is characterized by a topological quantum

Following in the spirit of the claim that summarization is a combination of

importance, and diversity and conduct an extensive analysis of the biases of
each sub-aspect with respect to the domain of nine different summarization
corpora (e.g., news, academic papers, meeting minutes, movie script, books,
posts). We find that while position exhibits substantial bias in news articles,
this is not the case, for example, with academic papers and meeting minutes.
Furthermore, our empirical study shows that different types of summarization
systems (e.g., neural-based) are composed of different degrees of the
sub-aspects. Our study provides useful lessons regarding consideration of
underlying sub-aspects when collecting a new summarization dataset or

their input power. In the literature, different models have been proposed
mainly for relatively small and large input power regimes of an EH. Due to the
complexity of the proposed nonlinear models, obtaining analytical optimal or
well performing signal designs have been extremely challenging. Relying on the
proposed models in the literature, the learning problem of modulation design
for simultaneous wireless information-power transfer (SWIPT) over a
point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the
receiver is implemented using neural network (NN)-based autoencoders. The
results reveal that for relatively small channel input powers, as the power
demand increases at the receiver, one of the symbols is shot away from the
origin while the remaining symbols approach zero amplitude. In the very extreme
case of merely receiver power demand, the modulations are in the form of On-Off
keying signalling with a low probability of the On signal. On the other side,
for relatively large channel input powers, it is observed that as the receiver
power demand increases, a number of symbols approach zero amplitude, whereas
the others (more than one symbol) get equally high amplitudes but with
different phases. In the extreme scenario of merely receiver power demand, the
modulation resembles multiple On-Off keying signalling with different phases.

this representation associates a unique vector to an equivalence class of nodal

this paper is to develop the machinery needed to use the NRIC for solving

derive an implicit description of the space of discrete surfaces as a
submanifold of an Euclidean space and a corresponding description of its

exhibit a moderate multiplicity dependence whereas $T_{\rm kin}$ drops, from

However, recently in the study of the Yang-Baxter equation, many algebraic
structures with alternative ""distributive"" laws were defined. In an effort to
study these ""left distributive"" laws and the interaction they entail on the
algebraic structures, Brzezi\'nski introduced skew left trusses and left
semi-trusses. In particular the class of left semi-trusses is very wide, since
it contains all rings, associative algebras and distributive lattices. In this
paper, we investigate the subclass of left semi-trusses that behave like the
algebraic structures that came up in the study of the Yang-Baxter equation. We
study the interaction of the operations and what this interaction entails on
their respective semigroups. In particular, we prove that in the finite case
the additive structure is a completely regular semigroup. Secondly, we apply
our results on a particular instance of a left semi-truss called an almost left
semi-brace, introduced by Miccoli to study its algebraic structure. In
particular, we show that one can associate a left semi-brace to any almost left
semi-brace. Furthermore, we show that the set-theoretic solutions of the
Yang-Baxter equation originating from almost left semi-braces arise from this
correspondence.

light curve with the duration of almost 1500 days with 60 second cadence. Such
high quality data of this nova-like system with obvious fast optical
variability show multicomponent power density spectra. Our goal is to study the
light curve from different point of view, and perform a shot profile analysis.
We search for characteristics not discovered with standard power density
spectrum based methods. The shot profile method identifies individual shots in
the light curve, and averages them in order to get all substructures with
typical time scales. We also tested the robustness of our analysis using simple
shot noise model. We obtained mean profiles with multicomponent features. The
shot profile method distinguishes substructures with similar time scales which
appear as a single degenerate feature in power density spectra. Furthermore,
this method yields the identification of another high frequency component in
the power density spectra of Kepler and XMM-Newton data not detected so far.
Moreover, we found side-lobes accompanied with the central spike, making the
profile very similar to another Kepler data of blazar W2R 1926+42, and Ginga
data of Cyg X-1. All three objects show similar time scale ratios of the rising
vs. declining part of the central spikes, while the two binaries have also
similar rising profiles of the shots described by a power-law function. The
similarity of both binary shot profiles suggests that the shots originate from
the same origin, e.g. aperiodic mass accretion in the accretion disc. Moreover,
the similarity with the blazar may imply that the ejection fluctuations in the
blazar jet are connected to accretion fluctuations driving the variability in
binaries. This points out to connection between jet and the accretion disc.

the $S$-matrix poles in the complex energy plane as a function of the
interaction strength. Already without introducing a genuine quark resonant
state, two physically interesting resonances emerge with pole masses around
1200 MeV and 1400 MeV, with the dominant $\pi N$ and $\pi\Delta$ component,
respectively. The added genuine resonant state in the $(1s)^3$ quark
configuration mixes with the lower dynamically generated resonance forming the
physical $\Delta(1232)$ resonance, and pushes the second dynamical resonance to
around 1500 MeV, which allows it to be identified with the $\Delta(1600)$
resonance. Adding a second resonant state with one quark promoted to the $2s$
orbit generates another pole whose evolution remains well separated from the
lower two poles. We calculate the helicity amplitudes at the pole and suggest
that their $Q^2$ dependence could be a decisive test to discriminate between

tens of $\mu$as. From lens modelling, we exclude a shift in the lensing galaxy
as the cause of the positional change of the lensed images, and we assign it to
the background source. The source consists of four sub-components separated by
$\sim 175$ pc, with proper motion of the order of tens $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ for
the two components at highest magnification ($\mu\sim350$) and of the order of
a few mas yr$^{-1}$ for the two components at lower magnification ($\mu\sim2$).
We propose single AGN and dual AGN scenarios to explain the source plane.
Although, the latter interpretation is supported by the archival

represent the highest redshift dual radio-loud AGN system discovered thus far,

the transition matrix of this Markov chain are $\pm 1$ integer combinations of
the transition probabilities if the posets that prescribe the restrictions on

ordinal sums of a rooted forest and so called ladders. For some of the results

ladder compounds BaFe$_2X_3$ ($X$=S, Se) started the novel field of
quasi-one-dimensional iron-based superconductors. In this publication, we use
Density Functional Theory (DFT) to predict that the previously barely explored
ladder compound RbFe$_2$Te$_3$ should be magnetic with a CX-type arrangement
involving ferromagnetic rungs and antiferromagnetic legs, at the realistic
density of $n=5.5$ electrons per iron. The magnetic state similarity with
BaFe$_2$S$_3$ suggests that RbFe$_2$Te$_3$ could also become superconducting
under pressure. Moreover, at $n=6.0$ our DFT phase diagrams (with and without
lattice tetramerization) reveal that the stable magnetic states could be either
a 2$\times$2 magnetic Block-type, as for $X$=Se, or a previously never observed
before CY-type state, with ferromagnetic legs and antiferromagnetic rungs. In
the Te-based studies, electrons are more localized than in S, implying that the
degree of electronic correlation is enhanced for the Te case.

this by analysing long-time fluctuations, two-point correlation functions, and
the out-of-time-ordered correlator; analytically detailing deviation from ETH
predictions. We derive instead an ETH-like relation, with non-random
off-diagonals, for matrix elements of observables, with correlations that alter
long-time behaviour and constrain dynamics. Further, we analytically compute
the time-dependence of the decay to equilibrium, showing that it is
proportional to the survival probability of the initial state. We finally note
that the conditions studied are common in many physical scenarios, such as
under the rotating-wave approximation. We show numerically that predictions are

this paper, we present a new formulation of attention via the lens of the

applying kernel smoother over the inputs with the kernel scores being the
similarities between inputs. This new formulation gives us a better way to
understand individual components of the Transformer's attention, such as the
better way to integrate the positional embedding. Another important advantage
of our kernel-based formulation is that it paves the way to a larger space of
composing Transformer's attention. As an example, we propose a new variant of
Transformer's attention which models the input as a product of symmetric
kernels. This approach achieves competitive performance to the current state of

different kernel construction strategies on two widely used tasks: neural
machine translation and sequence prediction.

resort to greedy search which only allows them to explore a limited portion of
the latent space. In this work, we introduce a new latent variable model,
LaSyn, that captures the co-dependence between syntax and semantics, while
allowing for effective and efficient inference over the latent space. LaSyn
decouples direct dependence between successive latent variables, which allows
its decoder to exhaustively search through the latent syntactic choices, while
keeping decoding speed proportional to the size of the latent variable
vocabulary. We implement LaSyn by modifying a transformer-based NMT system and
design a neural expectation maximization algorithm that we regularize with
part-of-speech information as the latent sequences. Evaluations on four
different MT tasks show that incorporating target side syntax with LaSyn
improves both translation quality, and also provides an opportunity to improve

this concept is adapted here to the case of a spatially developing Blasius
boundary layer. Longer time horizons fundamentally change the nature of the
problem due to the loss of stability of the base flow due to
Tollmien--Schlichting (TS) waves. We demonstrate, using a moving box technique,
that efficient long-time tracking of edge trajectories is possible for the
parameter range relevant to bypass transition, even if the asymptotic state
itself remains out of reach. The flow along the edge trajectory features streak
switching observed for the first time in the Blasius boundary layer. At long

edge trajectories. In this situation we suggest a reinterpretation of the edge

  Interaction. A shorter version was presented at IMVIP 2019",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Moving Object Detection (MOD) is an important task for achieving robust
autonomous driving. An autonomous vehicle has to estimate collision risk with
other interacting objects in the environment and calculate an optional
trajectory. Collision risk is typically higher for moving objects than static
ones due to the need to estimate the future states and poses of the objects for
decision making. This is particularly important for near-range objects around
the vehicle which are typically detected by a fisheye surround-view system that
captures a 360{\deg} view of the scene. In this work, we propose a CNN
architecture for moving object detection using fisheye images that were
captured in autonomous driving environment. As motion geometry is highly
non-linear and unique for fisheye cameras, we will make an improved version of
the current dataset public to encourage further research. To target embedded
deployment, we design a lightweight encoder sharing weights across sequential
images. The proposed network runs at 15 fps on a 1 teraflops automotive
embedded system at accuracy of 40% IoU and 69.5% mIoU.

forms of intersentential relations in a paragraph: one is a human-created
linguistical relation that forms a structure (e.g., discourse tree) and the
other is a relation from latent representation learned from the sentences
themselves. Our two proposed models incorporate each form of relations into
document-level language models: the former is a supervised model that jointly
learns a language model as well as discourse relation prediction, and the
latter is an unsupervised model that is hierarchically conditioned by a
recurrent neural network (RNN) over the latent information. Our proposed models
with both forms of relations outperform the baselines in partially conditioned
paragraph generation task. Our codes and data are publicly available.

we discuss how to constrain the possible deviations of the classical general
relativity with the image of M87* observed by the Event Horizon Telescope. More
precisely, we want to know where is the event horizon for a non-rotating black
hole. General relativity predicts the horizon is located at the Schwarzschild
radius $r_\textrm{s}$, while other gravity theories may give different
predictions. We propose a parameterized Schwarzschild metric (PSM) in which the
horizon is located at $r=nr_\textrm{s}$, where $n$ is a real free parameter,
and prove general relativity with nonlinear electrodynamics allows $n\neq1$. In
the weak field region, the PSM is equivalent to the Schwarzschild metric
regardless of the value of $n$. In the strong field region, the difference
between the PSM and Schwarzschild metric would leave an imprint on the shadow
image. We present detailed calculations and discussions on the black hole
shadows with large background light source and accretion disk in the PSM
framework. More importantly, we point out that $n\approx2$ can be used to
explain why the black hole mass measured by the shadow is a factor of about two
larger than the previous gas dynamics measurements. If this explanation is
confirmed to be right, then this phenomenon, together with the late-time
cosmological acceleration, will be very important to test gravity theories.

rotating cylinders at a radius ratio of $\eta=0.714$ is measured using planar
{particle image velocimetry} in horizontal planes at different cylinder

We show that the local angular momentum transport (expressed in terms of a
Nusselt number) mainly takes place in the regions of the vortex in- and
outflow, where the radial and azimuthal velocity components are highly
correlated. The efficient momentum transfer is reflected in intermittent
bursts, which becomes visible in the exponential tails of the probability
density functions of the local Nusselt number. In addition, by calculating
azimuthal energy co-spectra, small-scale plumes are revealed to be the
underlying structure of these bursts. These flow features are very similar to
the one observed in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, which emphasizes the
analogies of these both systems. By performing a {complex proper orthogonal

comb (microcomb). A unitravelling-carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) converts
low-noise optical soliton pulses from the microcomb to a terahertz wave at the
soliton's repetition rate (331 GHz). With a free-running microcomb, the Allan
deviation of the Terahertz signal is 4.5*10^-9 at 1 s measurement time with a
phase noise of -72 dBc/Hz (-118 dBc/Hz) at 10 kHz (10 MHz) offset frequency. By
locking the repetition rate to an in-house hydrogen maser, in-loop fractional
frequency stabilities of 9.6*10^-15 and 1.9*10^-17 are obtained at averaging
times of 1 s and 2000 s respectively, limited by the maser reference signal.
Moreover, the terahertz signal is successfully used to perform a
proof-of-principle demonstration of terahertz imaging of peanuts. Combining the
monolithically integrated UTC-PD with an on-chip microcomb, the demonstrated
technique could provide a route towards highly stable continuous terahertz wave
generation in chip-scale packages for out-of-the-lab applications. In

OMC-1, OMC-2/3, OMC-4, OMC-5, NGC 1977, L1641-N, and the dark lane south

These clouds can also be classified into three groups: the integral-shaped
filament, the southern regions of Orion A, and the other filamentary structures
in the outer parts of Orion A and the DLSF. These groups show differences in
scaling relations between the physical properties of the clouds. We derived the

$X_{^{13}\mathrm{CO}}/X_{\mathrm{C}^{18}\mathrm{O}}$, which ranges from 5.6 to
17.4 on median over the individual clouds. The significant variation of
$X_{^{13}\mathrm{CO}}/X_{\mathrm{C}^{18}\mathrm{O}}$ is also seen within a
cloud in both of the spatial and velocity directions and the ratio tends to be
high at the edge of the cloud. The values of

of $A_V \gtrsim 3$ mag under the strong far-ultraviolet (FUV) environment of

weak FUV radiation field. These results are explained if the selective
photodissociation of C$^{18}$O is enhanced under a strong FUV environment and

therefore be mathematically described as periodic changes. Accordingly, we here
study how periodic shifts between different manifestations of social dilemmas
affect cooperation. We observe a non-trivial interplay between the inherent
spatiotemporal dynamics that characterizes the spreading of cooperation in a
particular social dilemma type and the frequency of payoff changes. In
particular, we show that periodic changes between two available games with
global ordering best be fast, while periodic changes between global and local
ordering games best be slow for cooperation to thrive. We also show that the
frequency of periodic changes between two local ordering social dilemmas is
irrelevant, because then the process is fast and simply the average cooperation
level of the two is returned. The structure of the interaction network plays an
important role too in that lattices promote local ordering, whilst random
graphs hinder the formation of compact cooperative clusters. Conversely, for
local ordering the regular structure of the interaction network is only
marginally relevant as role-separating checkerboard patterns do not rely on
long-range order.

form in magnetized molecular cloud cores remains debated. This work focuses on
how the disk formation is affected by turbulence and ambipolar diffusion (AD),
both separately and in combination, with an emphasis on the protostellar mass
accretion phase of star formation. We find that a relatively strong, sonic
turbulence on the core scale strongly warps but does not completely disrupt the
well-known magnetically-induced flattened pseudodisk that dominates the inner
protostellar accretion flow in the laminar case, in agreement with previous
work. The turbulence enables the formation of a relatively large disk at early
times with or without ambipolar diffusion, but such a disk remains strongly
magnetized and does not persist to the end of our simulation unless a
relatively strong ambipolar diffusion is also present. The AD-enabled disks in
laminar simulations tend to fragment gravitationally. The disk fragmentation is
suppressed by initial turbulence. The ambipolar diffusion facilitates the disk
formation and survival by reducing the field strength in the circumstellar
region through magnetic flux redistribution and by making the field lines there
less pinched azimuthally, especially at late times. We conclude that turbulence
and ambipolar diffusion complement each other in promoting disk formation. The
disks formed in our simulations inherit a rather strong magnetic field from its
parental core, with a typical plasma-$\beta$ of order a few tens or smaller,
which is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the values commonly adopted in MHD
simulations of protoplanetary disks. To resolve this potential tension,
longer-term simulations of disk formation and evolution with increasingly more
realistic physics are needed.

science and technology. In modern mathematics, however, probability theory
means nothing other than measure theory, and the operational characterization
of the notion of probability is not established yet. In this paper, based on
the toolkit of algorithmic randomness we present an operational
characterization of the notion of probability, called an ensemble, for general
discrete probability spaces whose sample space is countably infinite.
Algorithmic randomness, also known as algorithmic information theory, is a
field of mathematics which enables us to consider the randomness of an
individual infinite sequence. We use an extension of Martin-Loef randomness
with respect to a generalized Bernoulli measure over the Baire space, in order
to present the operational characterization. In our former work [K. Tadaki,
arXiv:1611.06201], we developed an operational characterization of the notion
of probability for an arbitrary finite probability space, i.e., a probability
space whose sample space is a finite set. We then gave a natural operational
characterization of the notion of conditional probability in terms of ensemble
for a finite probability space, and gave equivalent characterizations of the
notion of independence between two events based on it. Furthermore, we gave
equivalent characterizations of the notion of independence of an arbitrary
number of events/random variables in terms of ensembles for finite probability
spaces. In particular, we showed that the independence between events/random
variables is equivalent to the independence in the sense of van Lambalgen's
Theorem, in the case where the underlying finite probability space is
computable. In this paper, we show that we can certainly extend these results
over general discrete probability spaces whose sample space is countably
infinite.

While state-of-the-art deep learning approaches have shown potential in

genetic profile and properties of the target disease. Here, we introduce the
first generative model capable of tailoring anticancer compounds for a specific
biomolecular profile. Using a RL framework, the transcriptomic profiles of
cancer cells are used as a context for the generation of candidate molecules.
Our molecule generator combines two separately pretrained variational
autoencoders (VAEs) - the first VAE encodes transcriptomic profiles into a
smooth, latent space which in turn is used to condition a second VAE to
generate novel molecular structures on the given transcriptomic profile. The
generative process is optimized through PaccMann, a previously developed drug
sensitivity prediction model to obtain effective anticancer compounds for the
given context (i.e., transcriptomic profile). We demonstrate how the molecule
generation can be biased towards compounds with high predicted inhibitory
effect against individual cell lines or specific cancer sites. We verify our
approach by investigating candidate drugs generated against specific cancer
types and find the highest structural similarity to existing compounds with
known efficacy against these cancer types. We envision our approach to
transform in silico anticancer drug design by leveraging the biomolecular
characteristics of the disease in order to increase success rates in lead
compound discovery.

and driver assistance systems. Some road-users, however, are more important for
decision-making than others because of their respective intentions, ego
vehicle's intention and their effects on each other. In this paper, we propose
a novel architecture for road-user importance estimation which takes advantage
of the local and global context of the scene. For local context, the model
exploits the appearance of the road users (which captures orientation,
intention, etc.) and their location relative to ego-vehicle. The global context
in our model is defined based on the feature map of the convolutional layer of
the module which predicts the future path of the ego-vehicle and contains rich
global information of the scene (e.g., infrastructure, road lanes, etc.), as
well as the ego vehicle's intention information. Moreover, this paper
introduces a new data set of real-world driving, concentrated around
inter-sections and includes annotations of important road users. Systematic
evaluations of our proposed method against several baselines show promising
results.

  Driving Datasets","accepted by ITSC 2019",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous driving requires various computer vision algorithms, such as
object detection and tracking.Precisely-labeled datasets (i.e., objects are
fully contained in bounding boxes with only a few extra pixels) are preferred
for training such algorithms, so that the algorithms can detect exact locations
of the objects. However, it is very time-consuming and hence expensive to
generate precise labels for image sequences at scale. In this paper, we propose
DeepBbox, an algorithm that corrects loose object labels into right bounding
boxes to reduce human annotation efforts. We use Cityscapes dataset to show
annotation efficiency and accuracy improvement using DeepBbox. Experimental
results show that, with DeepBbox,we can increase the number of object edges
that are labeled automatically (within 1\% error) by 50% to reduce manual
annotation time.

binaries are prime sources of gravitational waves (GW) for Advanced LIGO/Virgo
and future ground-based detectors. Neutron-rich matter released from such
events undergo rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis as it
decompresses into space, enriching our universe with rare heavy elements like
gold and platinum. Radioactive decay of these unstable nuclei powers a rapidly
evolving, approximately isotropic thermal transient known as a ``kilonova',
which probes the physical conditions during the merger and its aftermath. Here
I review the history and physics of kilonovae, leading to the current paradigm
of day-timescale emission at optical wavelengths from lanthanide-free
components of the ejecta, followed by week-long emission with a spectral peak
in the near-infrared (NIR). These theoretical predictions, as compiled in the
original version of this review, were largely confirmed by the transient
optical/NIR counterpart discovered to the first NS-NS merger, GW170817,
discovered by LIGO/Virgo. Using a simple light curve model to illustrate the
essential physical processes and their application to GW170817, I then
introduce important variations about the standard picture which may be
observable in future mergers. These include ~hours-long UV precursor emission,
powered by the decay of free neutrons in the outermost ejecta layers or
shock-heating of the ejecta by a delayed ultra-relativistic outflow; and
enhancement of the luminosity from a long-lived central engine, such as an
accreting BH or millisecond magnetar. Joint GW and kilonova observations of
GW170817 and future events provide a new avenue to constrain the astrophysical
origin of the r-process elements and the equation of state of dense nuclear
matter.
