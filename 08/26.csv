change in the input can have a number of globally effective changes on the
output. In this work, we propose a method for learning disentangled
representations to allow for localized image manipulations. We use face images
as our example of choice. Depending on the image region, identity and other
facial attributes can be modified. The proposed network can transfer parts of a
face such as shape and color of eyes, hair, mouth, etc.~directly between
persons while all other parts of the face remain unchanged. The network allows
to generate modified images which appear like realistic images. Our model
learns disentangled representations by weak supervision. We propose a localized
resnet autoencoder optimized using several loss functions including a loss
based on the semantic segmentation, which we interpret as masks, and a loss
which enforces disentanglement by decomposition of the latent space into
statistically independent subspaces. We evaluate the proposed solution w.r.t.
disentanglement and generated image quality. Convincing results are
demonstrated using the CelebA dataset.

efficiently by Auger cascades, leading to charge states up to 16+. The dynamics
of the Coulomb explosion process are investigated by calculating the ions'
flight times numerically based on a geometric model of the experimental

explosion, previously introduced for multi-photon induced Coulomb explosion, is
applied in numerical simulations, giving good agreement with the experimental
results for medium charge states. Deviations for higher charges suggest the
need to include nuclear motion in a putatively more complete model. Detection
efficiency corrections from the simulations are used to determine the true

for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the high demand for
computing resources in training such models hinders their application in
practice. In order to alleviate this resource hunger in large-scale model
training, we propose a Patient Knowledge Distillation approach to compress an
original large model (teacher) into an equally-effective lightweight shallow
network (student). Different from previous knowledge distillation methods,
which only use the output from the last layer of the teacher network for
distillation, our student model patiently learns from multiple intermediate
layers of the teacher model for incremental knowledge extraction, following two
strategies: ($i$) PKD-Last: learning from the last $k$ layers; and ($ii$)
PKD-Skip: learning from every $k$ layers. These two patient distillation
schemes enable the exploitation of rich information in the teacher's hidden
layers, and encourage the student model to patiently learn from and imitate the
teacher through a multi-layer distillation process. Empirically, this
translates into improved results on multiple NLP tasks with significant gain in
training efficiency, without sacrificing model accuracy.

series of independent binary learners and recomposes them by combining their
outputs to reconstruct the multiclass classification results. Three widely-used
realizations of such decomposition methods are One-Versus-All (OVA),
One-Versus-One (OVO), and Error-Correcting-Output-Code (ECOC). While OVA and
OVO are quite simple, both of them assume all classes are orthogonal which
neglect the latent correlation between classes in real-world.
Error-Correcting-Output-Code (ECOC) based decomposition methods, on the other
hand, are more preferable due to its integration of the correlation among
classes. However, the performance of existing ECOC-based methods highly depends
on the design of coding matrix and decoding strategy. Unfortunately, it is
quite uncertain and time-consuming to discover an effective coding matrix with
appropriate decoding strategy. To address this problem, we propose LightMC, an
efficient dynamic multiclass decomposition algorithm. Instead of using fixed
coding matrix and decoding strategy, LightMC uses a differentiable decoding
strategy, which enables it to dynamically optimize the coding matrix and
decoding strategy, toward increasing the overall accuracy of multiclass
classification, via back propagation jointly with the training of base learners
in an iterative way. Empirical experimental results on several public
large-scale multiclass classification datasets have demonstrated the
effectiveness of LightMC in terms of both good accuracy and high efficiency.

In this study, we analyze a nonlinear, nonautonomous, nonhomogeneous open-loop

well understood theoretically. A satisfactory theoretical characterization of
deep learning however, is beginning to emerge. It covers the following
questions: 1) representation power of deep networks 2) optimization of the
empirical risk 3) generalization properties of gradient descent techniques ---
why the expected error does not suffer, despite the absence of explicit
regularization, when the networks are overparametrized? In this review we
discuss recent advances in the three areas. In approximation theory both
shallow and deep networks have been shown to approximate any continuous
functions on a bounded domain at the expense of an exponential number of
parameters (exponential in the dimensionality of the function). However, for a
subset of compositional functions, deep networks of the convolutional type can
have a linear dependence on dimensionality, unlike shallow networks. In
optimization we discuss the loss landscape for the exponential loss function
and show that stochastic gradient descent will find with high probability the
global minima. To address the question of generalization for classification
tasks, we use classical uniform convergence results to justify minimizing a
surrogate exponential-type loss function under a unit norm constraint on the
weight matrix at each layer -- since the interesting variables for
classification are the weight directions rather than the weights. Our approach,
which is supported by several independent new results, offers a solution to the
puzzle about generalization performance of deep overparametrized ReLU networks,
uncovering the origin of the underlying hidden complexity control.

in numerical analysis is adequate to accurately describe the geometry of
interfaces and defects in microstructures and, therefore, to capture the
physical processes in these regions of interest. For the defect-free interior
of phases and grains however, the high resolution is in view of only weakly
varying field properties not necessary such that mesh-coarsening in these
regions can improve efficiency without severe losses of accuracy in
simulations. The present work proposes two different variants of adaptive,
quadtree-based mesh-coarsening algorithms applied to pixelized images that
serves the purpose of a preprocessor for consecutive finite element analyses,
here, in the context of numerical homogenization. Error analysis is carried out
on the microscale by error estimation which itself is assessed by true error
computation. A modified stress recovery scheme for a superconvergent error
estimator is proposed which overcomes the deficits of the standard recovery
scheme for nodal stress computation in cases of interfaces with stiffness jump.
By virtue of error analysis the improved efficiency by the reduction of
unknowns is put into relation to the increase of the discretization error. This
quantitative analysis sets a rational basis for decisions on favorable meshes
having the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency as will be
underpinned by various examples.

adjacent floppy or rigid phases on sides has been revealed in the vicinity of
the rigidity onset of the network. Glass formers in the IP appear to be
reversible at glass transition and strong in dynamical fragility. Meanwhile,
the calorimetry experiments indicate the existence of a first-order
liquid-liquid transition (LLT) at a temperature above the glass transition in

that the intermediate phase is thermodynamically distinct that the transitions
to IP as varying the chemical composition in fact reflect the LLT: out of IP,
the glass is frozen in vibrational entropy-dominated heterogeneous structures
with voids; while inside IP, energy dominates and the microscopic structures of
liquids become homogeneous. Here we demonstrate such first-order thermodynamic
liquid-liquid transition numerically and analytically in an elastic network

inclusive scattering matrix related to inclusive cross-sections. The inclusive
scattering matrix can be expressed in terms of generalized Green functions by a
formula similar to the LSZ formula for the conventional scattering matrix.
  The consideration of inclusive scattering matrix is necessary in quantum
field theory if a unitary scattering matrix does not exist (if the theory does
not have particle interpretation). It is always necessary if we want to
consider collisions of quasiparticles.

$\omega^{2}.$ It has been demonstrated that (within the domain of
applicability) the diagonal Pad\'e transforms $\mathcal{P}_{6}^{6}$ and
$\mathcal{P}_{7}^{6}$ are always in a very good agreement with the numerical
results. In this paper we present a further extension of the method. We show
that it is possible to reproduce many known numerical results with a great
accuracy (or even exactly) if the Pad\'e transforms are constructed from the
perturbative series of a really high order. In our calculations the order
depends on the problem but it never exceeds 700. For example, the frequencies
of the gravitational mode $l=2,$ $n=0$ calculated with the aid of the Pad\'e
approximants and within the framework of the continued fractions method agree
to 24 decimal places. The use of such a large number of terms is necessary as
the stabilization of the quasinormal frequencies can be slow. Our results
reveal some unexpected features of the WKB-based approximations and may shed
some fresh light on the problem of overtones.

the volume and mass of hot gas are strongly and linearly correlated with the
star formation rate (SFR). This supports the idea that stellar/supernovae
feedback dominates the production of hot gas in these galaxies. We compared the
mass of X-ray-emitting hot gas Mx(gas) with the molecular and atomic hydrogen
interstellar gas masses in these galaxies (M(H2) and M(HI), respectively),
using published carbon monoxide and 21 cm HI measurements. Systems with higher
SFRs have larger Mx(gas)/(M(H2) + M(HI)) ratios on average, in agreement with
recent numerical simulations of star formation and feedback in merging
galaxies. The Mx(gas)/(M(H2) + M(HI)) ratio also increases with dust
temperature on average. The ratio Mx(gas)/SFR is anti-correlated with the IRAS
60 micron to 100 micron flux ratio and with the Spitzer 3.6 micron to 24
micron. These trends may be due to variations in the spatial density of young
stars, the stellar age, the ratio of young to old stars, the initial mass
function, and/or the efficiency of stellar feedback. Galaxies with low SFR (<1

recently, it has been shown for products of real matrices with anti-symmetric

groups developed by Harish-Chandra et al. needs to be modified when considering
the group action on general symmetric spaces of matrices. In the present work,
we consider the product of complex random matrices with Hermitian matrices, in
particular the former can be also rectangular while the latter has not to be
positive definite and is considered as a fixed matrix as well as a random
matrix. This generalises an approach for products involving the Gaussian

\cite{zhitnitsky} and exploited in the works
\cite{zhitnitsky2}-\cite{zhitnitsky13}. The new feature considered here is the
possibility that these nuggets become ferromagnetic. This possibility was
pointed out in \cite{tatsumi}, although ferromagnetism may also take place due
some anomaly terms found in \cite{son}-\cite{son2}. The purpose of the present
letter however, is not to give evidence in favor or against these statements.
Instead, it is focused in some direct consequences of this ferromagnetic
behavior, if it exists. The first is that the nugget magnetic field induces an
electric field due to the axion wall, which may induce pair production by
Schwinger effect. Depending on the value of the magnetic field, the pair
production can be quite large. A critical value for such magnetic field at the
surface of the nugget is obtained, and it is argued that the value of the
magnetic field of \cite{tatsumi} is at the verge of stability and may induce
large pair production. The consequences of this enhanced pair production may be
unclear. It may indicate that the the nugget evaporates, but on the other hand
it may be just an indication that the intrinsic magnetic field disappears and
the nuggets evolves to a non magnetized state such as
\cite{zhitnitsky}-\cite{zhitnitsky13}. The interaction of such magnetic and
electric nugget with the troposphere of the earth is also analyzed. However, if
the magnetic field does not decay before the actual universe, then this would
lead to high energy electron flux due to its interaction with the electron
gases of the Milky Way. This suggests that these magnetized quarks may be a
considerably part of dark matter, but only if their hypothetical magnetic and
electric fields are evaporated.

days, acknowledging the fact that individual level modeling fails to take into
account expected dependence/interaction between species. These models attempt
to capture species dependence through an associated correlation matrix arising
from a set of latent multivariate normal variables. However, these associations
offer little insight into dependence behavior between species at sites.
  We focus on presence/absence data using joint species modeling which
incorporates spatial dependence between sites. For pairs of species, we
emphasize the induced odds ratios (along with the joint probabilities of
occurrence); they provide much clearer understanding of joint presence/absence
behavior. In fact, we propose a spatial odds ratio surface over the region of
interest to capture how dependence varies over the region.
  We illustrate with a dataset from the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa
consisting of more than 600 species at more than 600 sites. We present the
spatial distribution of odds ratios for pairs of species that are positively
correlated and pairs that are negatively correlated under the joint species
distribution model.
  The multivariate normal covariance matrix associated with a collection of
species is only a device for creating dependence among species but it lacks
interpretation. By considering odds ratios, the quantitative ecologist will be
able to better appreciate the practical dependence between species that is
implicit in these joint species distribution modeling specifications.

conduction channels for the transport of electrical current. Beside the
topologically protected surface states (TSS), parallel channels may exist,
namely the interior of the not-ideally insulating TI film, the interface layer
to the substrate, and the substrate itself. To be able to take advantage of the
auspicious transport properties of the TSS, the influence of the parasitic
parallel channels on the total current transport has to be minimized. Because
the conductivity of the interior (bulk) of the thin TI film is difficult to
access by measurements, we propose here an approach for calculating the mobile
charge carrier concentration in the TI film. To this end, we calculate the
near-surface band bending using parameters obtained experimentally from
surface-sensitive measurements, namely (gate-dependent) four-point resistance
measurements and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). While in
most cases another parameter in the calculations, i.e. the concentration of
unintentional dopants inside the thin TI film, is unknown, it turns out that in
the thin-film limit the band bending is largely independent of the dopant
concentration in the film. Thus, a well-founded estimate of the total mobile
charge carrier concentration and the conductivity of the interior of the thin
TI film proves possible. Since the interface and substrate conductivities can
be measured by a four-probe conductance measurement prior to the deposition of
the TI film, the total contribution of all parasitic channels, and therefore
also the contribution of the vitally important TSS, can be determined reliably.

consider a droplet placed on a substrate with either a stiffness or surface
energy gradient, and consider its potential for motion via coupling to elastic
deformations of the substrate. In order to clarify the role of contact angles
and to obtain a tractable model, we consider a two-dimensional droplet. The
gradients in substrate material properties give rise to asymmetric solid
deformation and to unequal contact angles, thereby producing a force on the
droplet. We then use a dynamic viscoelastic model to predict the resulting
dynamics of droplets. Numerical results quantifying the effect of the gradients
establish that it is more feasible to induce droplet motion with a gradient in
surface energy. The results show that the magnitude of elastic modulus gradient
needed to induce droplet motion exceeds experimentally feasible limits in the
production of soft solids and is therefore unlikely as a passive mechanism for
cell motion. In both cases, of surface energy or elastic modulus, the threshold
to initiate motion is achieved at lower mean values of the material properties.

generative adversarial network (cycleGAN) with a linear blur kernel, which can
be used for both blind- and non-blind image deconvolution. In contrast to the
conventional cycleGAN approaches that require two deep generators, the proposed
cycleGAN approach needs only a single deep generator and a linear blur kernel,
which significantly improves the robustness and efficiency of network training.

of a malaria case. However, the symptoms of clinical malaria are unspecific,
overlapping with other childhood illnesses. Additionally, children in endemic
areas tolerate varying levels of parasitemia without symptoms. Together, this
makes finding a gold-standard case definition challenging. We present a method
to identify and estimate malaria vaccine efficacy that does not require an
observable gold-standard case definition. Instead, we leverage genetic traits
that are protective against malaria but not against other illnesses, e.g., the
sickle cell trait, to identify vaccine efficacy in a randomized trial. Inspired
by Mendelian randomization, we introduce Mendelian factorial design, a method
that augments a randomized trial with genetic variation to produce a natural
factorial experiment, which identifies vaccine efficacy under realistic
assumptions. A robust, covariance adjusted estimation procedure is developed
for estimating vaccine efficacy on the risk ratio and incidence ratio scales.
Simulations suggest that our estimator has good performance whereas standard
methods are systematically biased. We demonstrate that a combined estimator
using both our proposed estimator and the standard approach yields significant
improvements when the Mendelian factor is only weakly protective.

expect that MALA-within-Gibbs is useful for solving high-dimensional Bayesian
inference problems where the posterior exhibits sparse conditional structure at
least approximately. In this context, a partitioning of the state that
correctly reflects the sparse conditional structure must be found, and we
illustrate this process in two numerical examples. We also discuss trade-offs

$\Gamma_{5}$-like at larger diameter to $\Gamma_{1}$-like at smaller diameter.
After the crossover, the absorption intensity of the band-edge exciton states

ubiquitous in science and engineering. This work develops a new partitioned
exponential approach for the time integration of multiphysics problems. After a
possible semi-discretization in space, the class of problems under
consideration is modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations where
the right-hand side is a summation of two component functions, each
corresponding to a given set of physical processes.
  The partitioned-exponential methods proposed herein evolve each component of
the system via an exponential integrator, and information between partitions is
exchanged via coupling terms. The traditional approach to constructing
exponential methods, based on the variation-of-constants formula, is not
directly applicable to partitioned systems. Rather, our approach to developing
new partitioned-exponential families is based on a general-structure additive
formulation of the schemes. Two method formulations are considered, one based
on a linear-nonlinear splitting of the right hand component functions, and
another based on approximate Jacobians. The paper develops classical
(non-stiff) order conditions theory for partitioned exponential schemes based
on particular families of T-trees and B-series theory. Several practical
methods of third order are constructed that extend the Rosenbrock-type and
EPIRK families of exponential integrators. Several implementation optimizations
specific to the application of these methods to reaction-diffusion systems are
also discussed. Numerical experiments reveal that the new
partitioned-exponential methods can perform better than traditional
unpartitioned exponential methods on some problems.

to athermal, quasistatic simple shear near jamming onset is highly nonlinear.
Previous studies have shown that, at small pressure $p$, the ensemble-averaged
static shear modulus $\langle G-G_0 \rangle$ scales with $p^\alpha$, where
$\alpha \approx 1$, but above a characteristic pressure $p^{**}$, $\langle
G-G_0 \rangle \sim p^\beta$, where $\beta \approx 0.5$. However, we find that
the shear modulus $G^i$ for an individual packing typically decreases linearly
with $p$ along a geometrical family where the contact network does not change.
We resolve this discrepancy by showing that, while the shear modulus does
decrease linearly within geometrical families, $\langle G \rangle$ also depends
on a contribution from discontinuous jumps in $\langle G \rangle$ that occur at
the transitions between geometrical families. For $p > p^{**}$,
geometrical-family and rearrangement contributions to $\langle G \rangle$ are
of opposite signs and remain comparable for all system sizes. $\langle G
\rangle$ can be described by a scaling function that smoothly transitions
between the two power-law exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We also demonstrate
the phenomenon of {\it compression unjamming}, where a jammed packing can unjam
via isotropic compression.

complex optimization details. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework
to learn the convolutional features and perform the tracking process
simultaneously, namely, a unified convolutional tracker (UCT). Specifically,
the UCT treats feature extractor and tracking process both as convolution
operation and trains them jointly, which enables learned CNN features are
tightly coupled with tracking process. During online tracking, an efficient
model updating method is proposed by introducing peak-versus-noise ratio (PNR)
criterion, and scale changes are handled efficiently by incorporating a scale
branch into network. Experiments are performed on four challenging tracking
datasets: OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2015 and VOT2016. Our method achieves leading
performance on these benchmarks while maintaining beyond real-time speed.

for stability works well for the nonlinear master equation, where the

trade-off relation among the fluctuation of the observable, the mean change of
the observable, and the intrinsic speed. We also derive a novel thermodynamic
trade-off relation between the excess entropy production rate and the intrinsic

centralized power system to reduce the total electricity demand of its

formulated, in which the centralized power system acts as the leader that needs
to decide on a price at the peak demand period to incentivize prosumers to not
seeking any energy from it. The prosumers, on the other hand, act as followers
and respond to the leader's decision by forming suitable coalitions with
neighboring prosumers in order to participate in P2P energy trading to meet
their energy demand. The properties of the proposed Stackelberg game are
studied. It is shown that the game has a unique and stable Stackelberg
equilibrium, as a result of the stability of prosumers' coalitions. At the
equilibrium, the leader chooses its strategy using a derived closed-form
expression, while the prosumers choose their equilibrium coalition structure.
An algorithm is proposed that enables the centralized power system and the
prosumers to reach the equilibrium solution. Numerical case studies demonstrate
the beneficial properties of the proposed scheme.

as the Majorana Fermions has been observed, which makes
Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ the first high temperature topological
superconductor. Since large size single crystal of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$
can be easily grown, many researches have been performed. However, a large part
of the reported results are under controversy, including the resistivity,
susceptibility, Hall effect, gap structure, phase diagram, etc. These
controversies are believed to come from the sample-dependent Fe
nonstoichiometries, which originate from the partial occupation of the second
Fe site (excess Fe) in the Te/Se layer. The excess Fe with valence near Fe$^+$
will provide electron doping into the system. Meanwhile, the excess Fe is also
strongly magnetic, which will act as a paring breaker and also localize the
charge carriers. Removing the excess Fe is essential to probe the intrinsic
properties and mechanism of superconductivity of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$
compounds. In this topical review, we propose the effective approaches to
remove excess Fe in Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$. Furthermore, we discuss the
mechanism of annealing based on the evolutions of structure, composition, and
morphology with annealing. Moreover, we also review the annealing effects on
the normal state and superconducting properties, including the magnetism,
transport properties, band structure, $T_{\rm{c}}$, phase diagram, upper
critical field, anisotropy, critical current density, gap structure, and
superconducting pairing. This review presents not only the optimal way to
prepare crystals without excess Fe, but also the intrinsic properties of
Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ without the influence of excess Fe.

setting of conversational search. One of its major challenges is to leverage
the conversation history to understand and answer the current question. In this
work, we propose a novel solution for ConvQA that involves three aspects.
First, we propose a positional history answer embedding method to encode
conversation history with position information using BERT in a natural way.
BERT is a powerful technique for text representation. Second, we design a
history attention mechanism (HAM) to conduct a ""soft selection"" for
conversation histories. This method attends to history turns with different
weights based on how helpful they are on answering the current question. Third,
in addition to handling conversation history, we take advantage of multi-task
learning (MTL) to do answer prediction along with another essential
conversation task (dialog act prediction) using a uniform model architecture.
MTL is able to learn more expressive and generic representations to improve the
performance of ConvQA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with
extensive experimental evaluations on QuAC, a large-scale ConvQA dataset. We
show that position information plays an important role in conversation history
modeling. We also visualize the history attention and provide new insights into
conversation history understanding.

stealthy attacks, namely the zero-dynamics attack (ZDA), for multi-agent
control systems. ZDA poses a formidable security challenge since its attack
signal is hidden in the null-space of the state-space representation of the
control system and hence it can evade conventional detection methods. An
intuitive defense strategy builds on changing the aforementioned representation
via switching through a set of carefully crafted topologies. In this paper, we
propose realistic ZDA variations where the attacker is aware of this
topology-switching strategy, and hence employs the following policies to avoid
detection: (i) pause, update and resume ZDA according to the knowledge of
switching topologies; (ii) cooperate with a concurrent stealthy topology attack
that alters network topology at switching times, such that the original ZDA is
feasible under the corrupted topology. We first systematically study the
proposed ZDA variations, and then develop defense strategies against them under
the realistic assumption that the defender has no knowledge of attack starting,

monitored, and the measurements of the monitored agents that should be

have been reported in some three-dimensional (3D) materials. Here, we propose
that triple points, nexus points and related phases, such as topological tangle
nodal lines, can be obtained by alternatively stacking two types of monolayers.
Two conditions for the stacking monolayers are required: the first condition is
that they have a three-fold (C3) rotation symmetry and three mirror planes
along the C3 axis; the second condition is that one of the monolayers should be
insulating while the other one should be metallic (or semiconducting) and has a
double degenerate band and a nondegenerate band at {\Gamma}point around the
Fermi level. Hexagonal boron nitride (HBN) and {\alpha}/{\alpha}^'-boron sheets
({\alpha}/{\alpha}^'-BS) are suggested as candidate materials. Even if HBN is a
wide-gap insulator, the interactions between layers lead to crossings of the
nondegenerate and double degenerate bands along the direction normal to the
nanosheets, and thus form triple/nexus points or related phases. A
tight-binding model is adopted to explain the phase transition between triple
points, nexus points and other related phases.

geometry that is genuinely fractal with a Hausdorff dimension equal to 4.
Coupling gravity to a statistical system at criticality changes the fractal
properties of the geometry in a way that depends on the central charge of the
critical system. Establishing the dependence of the Hausdorff dimension on this
central charge $c$ has been an important open problem in physics and
mathematics in the past decades. All simulation data produced thus far has
supported a formula put forward by Watabiki in the nineties. However, recent
rigorous bounds on the Hausdorff dimension in Liouville quantum gravity show
that Watabiki's formula cannot be correct when $c$ approaches $-\infty$. Based
on simulations of discrete surfaces encoded by random planar maps and a
numerical implementation of Liouville quantum gravity, we obtain new
finite-size scaling estimates of the Hausdorff dimension that are in clear
contradiction with Watabiki's formula for all simulated values of $c\in
(-\infty,0)$. Instead, the most reliable data in the range $c\in [-12.5, 0)$ is
in very good agreement with an alternative formula that was recently suggested
by Ding and Gwynne. The estimates for $c\in(-\infty,-12.5)$ display a negative
deviation from the latter formula, but the scaling is seen to be less accurate

probability distribution on graphs arising from the action of competing social
forces that make ties more or less likely, depending on the state of the rest
of the graph. Such forces often lead to a complex pattern of dependence among
edges, with non-trivial large-scale structures emerging from relatively simple
local mechanisms. While this provides a powerful tool for probing macro-micro
connections, much remains to be understood about how local forces shape global
outcomes. One simple question of this type is that of the conditions needed for
social forces to stabilize a particular structure. We refer to this property as
local stability and seek a general means of identifying the set of parameters
under which a target graph is locally stable with respect to a set of
alternatives. Here, we provide a complete characterization of the region of the
parameter space inducing local stability, showing it to be the interior of a
convex cone whose faces can be derived from the change-scores of the sufficient
statistics vis-a-vis the alternative structures. As we show, local stability is
a necessary but not sufficient condition for more general notions of stability,
the latter of which can be explored more efficiently by using the ``stable
cone'' within the parameter space as a starting point. In addition, we show how
local stability can be used to determine whether a fitted model implies that an
observed structure would be expected to arise primarily from the action of
social forces, versus by merit of the model permitting a large number of high
probability structures, of which the observed structure is one. We also use our
approach to identify the dyads within a given structure that are the least
stable, and hence predicted to have the highest probability of changing over
time.

quantified by the number of external control inputs needed to recover or to
retain the controllability after the occurrence of an unexpected attack. The
measure of the network controllability robustness, on the other hand, is
quantified by a sequence of values that record the remaining controllability of
the network after a sequence of attacks. Traditionally, the controllability
robustness is determined by attack simulations, which is computationally time

2) the adjacency matrix of a network can be regarded as a gray-scale image, and

[SODA2016] for addressing the design of CONGEST algorithms running fast in

an $f$-round algorithm of constructing shortcuts of quality $q$ for any
instance in $X$ results in $\tilde{O}(q + f)$-round algorithms of solving
several fundamental graph problems such as minimum spanning tree and minimum

  In this paper, we consider the relationship between the quality of
low-congestion shortcuts and three major graph parameters, chordality,
diameter, and clique-width. The main contribution of the paper is threefold:
(1) We show an $O(1)$-round algorithm which constructs a low-congestion
shortcut with quality $O(kD)$ for any $k$-chordal graph, and prove that the
quality and running time of this construction is nearly optimal up to
polylogarithmic factors. (2) We present two algorithms, each of which
constructs a low-congestion shortcut with quality $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ in
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ rounds for graphs of $D=3$, and that with quality
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ in $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ rounds for graphs of $D=4$
respectively. These results obviously deduce two MST algorithms running in
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ rounds for $D=3$ and $4$
respectively, which almost close the long-standing complexity gap of the MST
construction in small-diameter graphs originally posed by Lotker et al.

help the construction of good shortcuts by presenting a network topology of
clique-width six where the construction of MST is as expensive as the general

from such models. We add to this literature by outlining an approach to
constructing predictive distributions that are `marginally calibrated'. This is
where the long run average of the predictive distributions of the response
variable matches the observed empirical margin. Our approach considers a DNN
regression with a conditionally Gaussian prior for the final layer weights,
from which an implicit copula process on the feature space is extracted. This
copula process is combined with a non-parametrically estimated marginal
distribution for the response. The end result is a scalable distributional DNN
regression method with marginally calibrated predictions, and our work
complements existing methods for probability calibration. The approach is first
illustrated using two applications of dense layer feed-forward neural networks.
However, our main motivating applications are in likelihood-free inference,
where distributional deep regression is used to estimate marginal posterior
distributions. In two complex ecological time series examples we employ the
implicit copulas of convolutional networks, and show that marginal calibration
results in improved uncertainty quantification. Our approach also avoids the
need for manual specification of summary statistics, a requirement that is
burdensome for users and typical of competing likelihood-free inference
methods.

ratios. The first method is to train the model on the source dataset, and then
fine-tune the resulting model parameters on the target dataset. The second

location-based services because it can help people to explore new locations and
promote advertisers to launch advertisements at appropriate locations. The
existing POI recommendation systems require raw check-in history of users,
which might cause location privacy violations. Although there have been several
matrix factorization (MF) based privacy-preserving recommendation systems, they
can only focus on user-POI relationships without considering the human
movements in check-in history. To tackle this problem, we design a successive
POI recommendation framework with local differential privacy, named SPIREL.
SPIREL uses two types of information derived from the check-in history as input
for the factorization: a transition pattern between two POIs and the visit
counts of POIs. We propose a novel objective function for learning the user-POI
and POI-POI relationships simultaneously. We further integrate local
differential privacy mechanisms in our proposed framework to prevent potential
location privacy breaches. Experiments using four public datasets demonstrate
that SPIREL achieves better POI recommendation quality while accomplishing
stronger privacy protection.

large data sets available for a wide range of turbulent flows that arise in
engineering applications. Drawing on this abundance of data, dynamical models
can be constructed to reproduce structural and statistical features of
turbulent flows, opening the way to the design of effective model-based flow
control strategies. This review describes a framework for completing
second-order statistics of turbulent flows by models that are based on the
Navier-Stokes equations linearized around the turbulent mean velocity. Systems
theory and convex optimization are combined to address the inherent uncertainty
in the dynamics and the statistics of the flow by seeking a suitable
parsimonious correction to the prior linearized model. Specifically, dynamical
couplings between states of the linearized model dictate structural constraints
on the statistics of flow fluctuations. Thence, colored-in-time stochastic
forcing that drives the linearized model is sought to account for and reconcile
dynamics with available data (i.e., partially known second order statistics).
The number of dynamical degrees of freedom that are directly affected by
stochastic excitation is minimized as a measure of model parsimony. The
spectral content of the resulting colored-in-time stochastic contribution can
alternatively be seen to arise from a low-rank structural perturbation of the
linearized dynamical generator, pointing to suitable dynamical corrections that
may account for the absence of the nonlinear interactions in the linearized
model.

importance of products of two primes in the RSA-cryptography. Several authors
obtained the asymptotic formulas of the number of the RSA integers. However,
the previous results on the number of the RSA integers were valid only in a
rather restricted range of the parameter $r$. Dummit, Granville, and Kisilevsky
found some bias in the distribution of products of two primes with congruence
conditions. Moree and the first author studied some similar bias in the RSA
integers, but they proved that at least for fixed $r$, there is no such bias.
In this paper, we provide an asymptotic formula for the number of the RSA
integers available in wider ranges of $r$, and give some observations of the
bias of the RSA integers, by interpolating the results of Dummit, Granville,
and Kisilevsky and of Moree and the first author.

hyperbolic spacetimes with timelike boundary as defined by Ak\'e, Flores and
Sanchez. In particular we start by investigating on these backgrounds the
D'Alembert - de Rham wave operator $\Box_k$ and we highlight the boundary
conditions which yield a Green's formula for $\Box_k$. Subsequently, we
characterize the space of solutions of the associated initial and boundary
value problem under the assumption that advanced and retarded Green operators
do exist. This hypothesis is proven to be verified by a large class of boundary
conditions using the method of boundary triples and under the additional
assumption that the underlying spacetime is ultrastatic. Subsequently we focus
on the Maxwell operator. First we construct the boundary conditions which
entail a Green's formula for such operator and then we highlight two
distinguished cases, dubbed $\delta\mathrm{d}$-tangential and
$\delta\mathrm{d}$-normal boundary conditions. Associated to these we introduce
two different notions of gauge equivalence and we prove that in both cases,
every equivalence class admits a representative abiding to the Lorenz gauge. We
use this property and the analysis of the operator $\Box_k$ to construct and to
classify the space of gauge equivalence classes of solutions of the Maxwell's
equations with the prescribed boundary conditions. As a last step and in the
spirit of future applications in the framework of algebraic quantum field
theory, we construct the associated unital $*$-algebras of observables proving
in particular that, as in the case of the Maxwell operator on globally
hyperbolic spacetimes with empty boundary, they possess a non-trivial center.

framework for control tasks built on the idea of constraints-driven control.
However, since control policies that keep a dynamical agent within state
constraints over infinite horizons are not always available, this work instead
considers constraints that can be satisfied over some finite time horizon T >
0, which we refer to as limited-duration safety. Consequently, value function
learning can be used as a tool to help us find limited-duration safe policies.
We show that, in some applications, the existence of limited-duration safe
policies is actually sufficient for long-duration autonomy. This idea is
illustrated on a swarm of simulated robots that are tasked with covering a
given area, but that sporadically need to abandon this task to charge
batteries. We show how the battery-charging behavior naturally emerges as a
result of the constraints. Additionally, using a cart-pole simulation
environment, we show how a control policy can be efficiently transferred from
the source task, balancing the pole, to the target task, moving the cart to one
direction without letting the pole fall down.

present Relation Distillation Networks (RDN) --- a new architecture that
novelly aggregates and propagates object relation to augment object features
for detection. Technically, object proposals are first generated via Region
Proposal Networks (RPN). RDN then, on one hand, models object relation via
multi-stage reasoning, and on the other, progressively distills relation
through refining supportive object proposals with high objectness scores in a

  Knowledge Selection for Background Based Conversation","accepted by AAAI 2020",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background Based Conversations (BBCs) have been introduced to help
conversational systems avoid generating overly generic responses. In a BBC, the
conversation is grounded in a knowledge source. A key challenge in BBCs is
Knowledge Selection (KS): given a conversational context, try to find the
appropriate background knowledge (a text fragment containing related facts or
comments, etc.) based on which to generate the next response. Previous work
addresses KS by employing attention and/or pointer mechanisms. These mechanisms
use a local perspective, i.e., they select a token at a time based solely on
the current decoding state. We argue for the adoption of a global perspective,
i.e., pre-selecting some text fragments from the background knowledge that
could help determine the topic of the next response. We enhance KS in BBCs by
introducing a Global-to-Local Knowledge Selection (GLKS) mechanism. Given a
conversational context and background knowledge, we first learn a topic
transition vector to encode the most likely text fragments to be used in the
next response, which is then used to guide the local KS at each decoding
timestamp. In order to effectively learn the topic transition vector, we
propose a distantly supervised learning schema. Experimental results show that
the GLKS model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
both automatic and human evaluation. More importantly, GLKS achieves this
without requiring any extra annotations, which demonstrates its high degree of
scalability.

neural networks to capture temporal dependencies. One potential limitation of
these methods is that they only model explicitly information interactions

between nonadjacent time steps are not fully exploited. It greatly limits the
capability of modeling the long-range temporal dependencies since one-order
interactions cannot be maintained for a long term due to information dilution
and gradient vanishing. To tackle this limitation, we propose the Non-local
Recurrent Neural Memory (NRNM) for supervised sequence modeling, which performs
non-local operations to learn full-order interactions within a sliding temporal
block and models global interactions between blocks in a gated recurrent
manner. Consequently, our model is able to capture the long-range dependencies.
Besides, the latent high-level features contained in high-order interactions
can be distilled by our model. We demonstrate the merits of our NRNM on two

one-dimensional case, the minimal speed $c^*_d(r)$ coincides with the

However, when this method is applied to satellite videos where spatial

conditions and on nonlinear functions involved in integrodifferential
equations. Further, we extend the integral inequality for piece-wise continuous
functions to mixed case and apply it to investigate the dependence of solution
on initial data through $\epsilon$-approximate solutions. It is seen that the
uniqueness and dependency results got by means of integral inequity requires
less restrictions on the functions involved in the equations than that required
through Picard operators theory.

  Semantic Segmentation: A Non-Adversarial Approach",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new approach, called self-motivated pyramid curriculum domain
adaptation (PyCDA), to facilitate the adaptation of semantic segmentation
neural networks from synthetic source domains to real target domains. Our
approach draws on an insight connecting two existing works: curriculum domain
adaptation and self-training. Inspired by the former, PyCDA constructs a
pyramid curriculum which contains various properties about the target domain.
Those properties are mainly about the desired label distributions over the
target domain images, image regions, and pixels. By enforcing the segmentation
neural network to observe those properties, we can improve the network's
generalization capability to the target domain. Motivated by the self-training,
we infer this pyramid of properties by resorting to the semantic segmentation
network itself. Unlike prior work, we do not need to maintain any additional
models (e.g., logistic regression or discriminator networks) or to solve minmax
problems which are often difficult to optimize. We report state-of-the-art
results for the adaptation from both GTAV and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, two
popular settings in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation.

designed and built by a team under the leadership of Wilhelm Kaemmerer at Carl
Zeiss Jena (CZJ) in 1954 and 1955. Basic experiments, design and construction
of machine-1 were all done, partly concurrently, in the remarkably short time
of about 14 months. Shortly after the electronic G 2 of Heinz Billing in
Goettingen it was the 7th universal computer in Germany and the 1st in the GDR.
The Oprema consisted of two identical machines. One machine consisted of about
8,300 relays, 45,000 selenium rectifiers and 250 km cable. The main reason for
the construction of the Oprema was the computational needs of CZJ, which was
the leading company for optics and precision mechanics in the GDR. During its
lifetime (1955-1963) the Oprema was applied by CZJ and a number of other
institutes and companies in the GDR. The paper presents new details of the
Oprema project and of the arithmetic operations implemented in the Oprema.

to automatically generate a network architecture for semantic image
segmentation. The generated network consists of a sequence of stacked
computation cells. A computation cell is represented as a directed acyclic
graph, in which each node is a hidden representation (i.e., feature map) and
each edge is associated with an operation (e.g., convolution and pooling),
which transforms data to a new layer. During the training, the CAS algorithm
explores the search space for an optimized computation cell to build a network.
The cells of the same type share one architecture but with different weights.
In real applications, however, an optimization may need to be conducted under
some constraints such as GPU time and model size. To this end, a cost
corresponding to the constraint will be assigned to each operation. When an
operation is selected during the search, its associated cost will be added to
the objective. As a result, our CAS is able to search an optimized architecture
with customized constraints. The approach has been thoroughly evaluated on
Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, and demonstrates superior performance over
several state-of-the-art techniques. More remarkably, our CAS achieves 72.3%
mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset with speed of 108 FPS on an Nvidia TitanXp GPU.

approaches for achieving verifiability: a) through end-to-end verifiable voting
(E2E-V) systems that offer cryptographic guarantees of correctness, and b)
through risk-limiting audit systems that do not rely on cryptography but verify
the tally reported by an electronic vote tabulation system against
voter-verified paper records (VVPRs). However, while end-to-end verifiable
methods lack easy methods of recovery in case elections fail to verify,
risk-limiting audit based methods usually require the electorate to trust the
post-election custody chain of the VVPRs. In this paper we examine recovery
from elections in dual voting, which combines the formal guarantees of E2E-V
with the simplicity of VVPR-based audit.
  We argue that large public elections should not only be publicly verifiable,
but, in case of verification failures, there should also be transparent methods
of recovery without necessarily re-running entire elections. We focus on
multi-polling booth elections and formally define the concept of recoverability
for such protocols. Informally, our formulation captures the ability to
verifiably identify the polling booths contributing to verification failures,
and the partial tally contributed by the other booths, without leaking any
additional information. This enables possible recovery through limited
re-polling, without necessitating a complete re-run of the election or
privileging the paper tally over the electronic one. We also propose a
multi-polling booth voting protocol called \emph{OpenVoting} that achieves our
proposed recoverability requirements.

the MR has been invented. Especially in volumetric imaging of thoracic and
abdominal organs, motion-awareness is essential for reducing motion artifacts
in the final image. A recently proposed MR imaging approach copes with motion
by observing the motion patterns during the acquisition. Repetitive scanning of
the k-space center region enables the extraction of the patient motion while
acquiring the remaining part of the k-space. Due to highly redundant
measurements of the center, the required scanning time of over 11 min and the
reconstruction time of 2 h exceed clinical applicability though. We propose an
accelerated motion-aware MR imaging method where the motion is inferred from
small-sized k-space center patches and an initial training phase during which
the characteristic movements are modeled. Thereby, acquisition times are
reduced by a factor of almost 2 and reconstruction times by two orders of
magnitude. Moreover, we improve the existing motion-aware approach with a
systematic temporal shift correction to achieve a sharper image reconstruction.
We tested our method on 12 volunteers and scanned their lungs and abdomen under

avoid the notorious single point of failure vulnerability. Since Nakamoto's
Bitcoin cryptocurrency system, an enormous number of decentralised applications
have been proposed on top of these technologies, aiming at more transparency
and trustworthiness than their traditional counterparts. These applications
spread over a lot of areas, e.g. financial services, healthcare,
transportation, supply chain management, and cloud computing. While Blockchain
brings transparency and decentralised trust intuitively due to the consensus of
a (very large) group of nodes (or, miners), it introduces very subtle
implications for other desirable properties such as privacy. In this work, we
demonstrate these subtle implications for Blockchain-based searchable
encryption solutions, which are one specific use case of cloud computing
services. These solutions rely on Blockchain to achieve both the standard
privacy property and the new fairness property, which requires that search
operations are carried out faithfully and are rewarded accordingly. We show
that directly replacing the server in an existing searchable encryption
solution with a Blockchain will cause undesirable operational cost, privacy
loss, and security vulnerabilities. The analysis results indicate that a
dedicated server is still needed to achieve the desired privacy guarantee. To
this end, we propose two frameworks which can be instantiated based on most
existing searchable encryption schemes. Through analysing these two frameworks,
we affirmatively show that a carefully engineered Blockchain-based solution can
achieve the desired fairness property while preserving the privacy guarantee of
the original searchable encryption scheme simultaneously.

spanwise traveling transversal surface waves in zero-pressure gradient
turbulent boundary layer flow. Eighty variations of wavelength, period, and
amplitude of the space- and time-dependent sinusoidal wall motion are
considered for a boundary layer at a momentum thickness based Reynolds number
of $Re_\theta = 1000$. The results show a strong decrease of friction drag of
up to $26\,\%$ and considerable net power saving of up to $10\,\%$. However,
the highest net power saving does not occur at the maximum drag reduction. The
drag reduction is modeled as a function of the actuation parameters by support
vector regression using the LES data.
  A substantial attenuation of the near-wall turbulence intensity and
especially a weakening of the near-wall velocity streaks are observed.
Similarities between the current actuation technique and the method of a
spanwise oscillating wall without any normal surface deflection are reported.
In particular, the generation of a directional spanwise oscillating Stokes
layer is found to be related to skin-friction reduction.

therefore is particularly important to have an understanding of the underlying

  (Extended Version)","18 pages (2 pages of references), 4 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many academic and industrial research works on WANETs rely on simulations, at
least in the first stages, to obtain preliminary results to be subsequently
validated in real settings. Topology generators (TG) are commonly used to
generate the initial placement of nodes in artificial WANET topologies, where
those simulations take place. The significance of these experiments heavily
depends on the representativeness of artificial topologies. Indeed, if they
were not drawn fairly, obtained results would apply only to a subset of
possible configurations, hence they would lack of the appropriate generality
required to port them to the real world. Although using many TGs could mitigate
this issue by generating topologies in several different ways, that would
entail a significant additional effort. Hence, the problem arises of what TGs
to choose, among a number of available generators, to maximise the
representativeness of generated topologies and reduce the number of TGs to use.
  In this paper, we address that problem by investigating the presence of bias
in the initial placement of nodes in artificial WANET topologies produced by
different TGs. We propose a methodology to assess such bias and introduce two
metrics to quantify the diversity of the topologies generated by a TG with
respect to all the available TGs, which can be used to select what TGs to use.
We carry out experiments on three well-known TGs, namely BRITE, NPART and
GT-ITM. Obtained results show that using the artificial networks produced by a
single TG can introduce bias.

Service Providers (ISPs) can act as leverage for enhancing the infrastructure

infrastructure that improve Quality of Service (QoS) for users if attractive
contracts are negotiated between them and CPs. The idea here is that part of
the net profit gained by CPs are given to ISPs to invest in the network. The
Moral Hazard economic framework is used to model such an interaction, in which
a principal determines a contract, and an agent reacts by adapting her effort.
In our setting, several competitive CPs interact through one common ISP. Two
cases are studied: (i) the ISP differentiates between the CPs and makes a
(potentially) different investment to improve the QoS of each CP, and (ii) the
ISP does not differentiate between CPs and makes a common investment for both.
The last scenario can be viewed as \emph{network neutral behavior} on the part
of the ISP. We analyse the optimal contracts and show that the CP that can
better monetize its demand always prefers the non-neutral regime.
Interestingly, ISP revenue, as well as social utility, are also found to be
higher under the non-neutral regime.

most successful methods to generate single- to few-cycle terahertz pulses.
However, the generated terahertz pulses have a large spatial inhomogeneity, due
to the noncollinear phase matching condition and the asymmetry of the
prism-shaped nonlinear crystal geometry, especially when pushing for high
optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiency. A 3D+1 (x,y,z,t) numerical model is
necessary in order to fully investigate the terahertz generation problem in the
tilted-pulse-front scheme. We compare in detail the differences between 1D+1,
2D+1 and 3D+1 models. The simulations show that the size of the optical beam in
the pulse-front-tilt plane sensitively affects the spatio-temporal properties
of the terahertz electric field. The terahertz electric field is found to have
a strong spatial dependence such that a few-cycle pulse is only generated near
the apex of the prism. The part of the beam farther from the apex contains a
large fraction of the energy but has a waveform that deviates from a few-cycle.
This strong spatial dependence must be accounted for when using the terahertz
pulses for strong-field physics and carrier-envelope-phase sensitive
experiments such as terahertz acceleration, coherent control of
antiferromagnetic spin waves and terahertz high-harmonic generation.

on the measurement time, it cannot be reduced arbitrarily as the signal used
for the measurement cannot propagate with speed greater than that of light. In
view of this reasoning, one is led to conclude that the clock should be heavy
enough to slow down its wave-function from spreading with time. However, the
general relativity puts an upper bound on clock's mass, since its size must
remain greater then the Schwarzschild radius associated to it. This way one
reaches a limit in length measurement. However, as is discussed below, an
additional insight into the question comes by taking into account
self-gravitational effects. As a result, the uncertainty in length measurement

(CDF-S) by using the deepest X-ray observation to date, the $\textit{Chandra}$
7 Ms observation of the CDF-S. We combined an opimized version of our automated
selection technique and a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) spectral
fitting procedure, to develop a method to pinpoint and then characterize
candidate CT AGN as less model dependent and/or data-quality dependent as
possible. To obtain reliable automated spectral fits, we only considered the
sources detected in the hard (2-8 keV) band from the CDF-S 2 Ms catalog with
either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts available for 259 sources.
Instead of using our spectral analysis to decide if an AGN is CT, we derived
the posterior probability for the column density, and then we used it to assign
a probability of a source being CT. We also tested how the model-dependence of
the spectral analysis, and the spectral data quality, could affect our results
by using simulations. We finally derived the number density of CT AGN by taking
into account the probabilities of our sources being CT and the results from the
simulations. Our results are in agreement with X-ray background synthesis
models, which postulate a moderate fraction (25%) of CT objects among the
obscured AGN population.

is an important step to objectively compare systems and their configuration.
There exist well-established measures for both tasks separately. However, there
is no sophisticated evaluation scheme to measure the quality of a combined text
line detection and text recognition system. The F-measure on word level is a
well-known methodology, which is sometimes used in this context. Nevertheless,
it does not take into account the alignment of hypothesis and ground truth text
and can lead to deceptive results. Since users of automatic information
retrieval pipelines in the context of text recognition are mainly interested in
the end-to-end performance of a given system, there is a strong need for such a
measure. Hence, we present a measure to evaluate the quality of an end-to-end
text recognition system. The basis for this measure is the well established and
widely used character error rate, which is limited -- in its original form --
to aligned hypothesis and ground truth texts. The proposed measure is flexible
in a way that it can be configured to penalize different reading orders between
the hypothesis and ground truth and can take into account the geometric
position of the text lines. Additionally, it can ignore over- and under-
segmentation of text lines. With these parameters it is possible to get a
measure fitting best to its own needs.

including many companies located in different countries, makes it challenging
to assess the history and integrity of procured physical parts, and to make
organisations really accountable for their conduct. This enables malicious
practices like counterfeiting and insertion of back doors, which are extremely
dangerous, especially in supply chains of physical parts for industrial control
systems used in critical infrastructures, where a country and human lives can
be put at risk. This paper aims at mitigating these issues by proposing an
approach where procured parts are uniquely identified and tracked along the
chain, across multiple sites, to detect tampering. Our solution is based on
consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies, hence it is
decentralised, highly available and provides strong guarantees on the integrity
of stored data and executed business logic. The unique identification of parts
along the chain is implemented by using physically unclonable functions (PUFs)
as tamper-resistant IDs. We first define the threat model of an adversary
interested in tampering with physical products along the supply chain, then
provide the design of the tracking system that implements the proposed
anti-counterfeiting approach. We present a security analysis of the tracking
system against the designated threat model and a prototype evaluation to show
its technical feasibility and assess its effectiveness in counterfeit
mitigation. Finally, we discuss several key practical aspects concerning our
solution ad its integration with real supply chains.

connectivity constraints by the means of graph flows. In this work, we
investigate the efficiency of a constraint generation algorithm, where we
iteratively add cut constraints to a simple ILP until a feasible (and optimal)
solution is found. It turns out that our method is faster than the previous
best flow-based MILP algorithm on random generated instances, which suggests
that a constraint generation approach might be also useful for other
optimization problems dealing with connectivity constraints. At last, we

to infer the spatial distribution of subsurface properties such as shear-wave
velocities. These properties can be estimated vertically below any geographical
location at which surface wave dispersion data are available. As the inversion
is significantly non-linear, Monte Carlo methods are often used to invert
dispersion curves for shear-wave velocity profiles with depth to give a
probabilistic solution. Such methods provide uncertainty information but are
computationally expensive. Neural network based inversion provides a more
efficient way to obtain probabilistic solutions when those solutions are
required beneath many geographical locations. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, once
a network has been trained it can be applied rapidly to perform any number of
inversions. We train a class of neural networks called mixture density
networks, to invert dispersion curves for shear-wave velocity models and their
non-linearised uncertainty. Mixture density networks are able to produce fully
probabilistic solutions in the form of weighted sums of multivariate analytic
kernels such as Gaussians, and we show that including data uncertainties in the
mixture density network gives more reliable mean velocity estimates when data
contains significant noise. The networks were applied to data from the Grane
field in the Norwegian North sea to produce shear-wave velocity maps at several
depth levels. Post-training we obtained probabilistic velocity profiles with
depth beneath 26,772 locations to produce a 3D velocity model in 21 seconds on
a standard desktop computer. This method is therefore ideally suited for rapid,
repeated 3D subsurface imaging and monitoring.

have been used to improve the performance of sentiment classification models.
The de facto standard method is to incorporate them as additional biases in the
attention mechanism, and more performance gains are achieved by extending the
model architecture. In this paper, we show that the above method is the least
effective way to represent and inject attributes. To demonstrate this
hypothesis, unlike previous models with complicated architectures, we limit our
base model to a simple BiLSTM with attention classifier, and instead focus on
how and where the attributes should be incorporated in the model. We propose to
represent attributes as chunk-wise importance weight matrices and consider four
locations in the model (i.e., embedding, encoding, attention, classifier) to
inject attributes. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves
significant improvements over the standard approach and that attention
mechanism is the worst location to inject attributes, contradicting prior work.
We also outperform the state-of-the-art despite our use of a simple base model.

possibility of building an ""auto-complete"" function for inventors to conceive
better inventions in the era of artificial intelligence. In order to generate
patent claims with good quality, a fundamental question is how to measure it.
We tackle the problem from a perspective of claim span relevancy. Patent claim
language was rarely explored in the NLP field. It is unique in its own way and
contains rich explicit and implicit human annotations. In this work, we propose
a span-based approach and a generic framework to measure patent claim
generation quantitatively. In order to study the effectiveness of patent claim
generation, we define a metric to measure whether two consecutive spans in a
generated patent claims are relevant. We treat such relevancy measurement as a
span-pair classification problem, following the concept of natural language
inference. Technically, the span-pair classifier is implemented by fine-tuning
a pre-trained language model. The patent claim generation is implemented by
fine-tuning the other pre-trained model. Specifically, we fine-tune a
pre-trained Google BERT model to measure the patent claim spans generated by a
fine-tuned OpenAI GPT-2 model. In this way, we re-use two of the
state-of-the-art pre-trained models in the NLP field. Our result shows the
effectiveness of the span-pair classifier after fine-tuning the pre-trained

investigated areas of computational mathematics. However, the problem of
computing spectra of general bounded infinite matrices has only recently been
solved. We establish some of the foundations of computational spectral theory
through the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, an approach closely
related to Smale's program on the foundations of computational mathematics and
McMullen's results on polynomial root finding with rational maps.
Infinite-dimensional problems yield an intricate infinite classification
theory, determining which spectral problems can be solved and with what types
of algorithms. We provide answers to many longstanding open questions on the
existence of algorithms. For example, we show that spectra can be computed,
with error control, from point sampling operator coefficients for large classes
of partial differential operators on unbounded domains. Further results
include: computing spectra of (possibly unbounded) operators on graphs and
separable Hilbert spaces with error control; determining if the spectrum
intersects a compact set; the computational spectral gap problem and computing
spectral classifications at the bottom of the spectrum; and computing discrete
spectra, multiplicities, eigenspaces and determining if the discrete spectrum
is non-empty. Moreover, the positive results with error control can be used in
computer-assisted proofs. In contrast, the negative results preclude
computer-assisted proofs for classes of operators as a whole. Our proofs are
constructive, yielding a library of new algorithms and techniques that handle
problems that before were out of reach. We demonstrate these algorithms on
challenging problems, giving concrete examples of the failure of traditional
approaches (e.g., ""spectral pollution"") compared to the introduced techniques.

Functional connectivity analyses of the interpolated volumes reveal an enriched

ranges, or to detect essential spectral gaps and the corresponding failure of
the finite section method. Despite new results on computing spectra and the
substantial interest in these geometric problems, there remain no general

insulator state is realized at $t_c$. The phase state is characterized by zero
energy Majorana states localized at the boundaries. Taking into account the
on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ (where $U<<1$), the criterion for the stability
of a topological insulator state is calculated at $t<<1$, $t \sim U$. Thus, in
the case of $ U > 4\Delta $, the topological insulator state, which is
determined by chiral gapless edge modes in the gap $\Delta$, is destroyed.

two-dimensional semiconductor where spins are ferromagnetically aligned within
a single layer. Potential applications in spintronics arise from an
antiferromagnetic ordering between adjacent layers that gives rise to spin
filtering and a large magnetoresistance in tunnelling devices. This key feature
appears only in thin multilayers and it is not inherited from bulk crystals,
where instead neighbouring layers share the same ferromagnetic spin
orientation. This discrepancy between bulk and thin samples is unexpected, as
magnetic ordering between layers arises from exchange interactions that are
local in nature and should not depend strongly on thickness. Here we solve this
controversy and show through polarization resolved Raman spectroscopy that thin
multilayers do not undergo a structural phase transition typical of bulk
crystals. As a consequence, a different stacking pattern is present in thin and
bulk samples at the temperatures at which magnetism sets in and, according to
previous first-principles simulations, this results in a different interlayer
magnetic ordering. Our experimental findings provide evidence for the strong
interplay between stacking order and magnetism in CrI$_3$, opening interesting
perspectives to design the magnetic state of van der Waals multilayers.

present work analyzes this force transmission in finite element simulations
with the main aim to avoid reported postsurgical bone density reduction as a
consequence of a reduced tibial bone loading. In the numerical analysis
different implant materials, stem/extension lengths and implant-to-stem
interface conditions are considered, from a stiff fully cemented fixation to
sliding contact conditions with a low friction coefficient. The impact of these
variations on bone loading changes are measured by (i) decomposing the total
force into parts mediated by the plate and by the stem and by (ii) post-surgery
strain energy density (SED) deviations. Based on a bionics-inspired perspective
on how nature in pre-operative conditions carries out force transfer from the
knee joint into the tibia, a modified implant-bone interface is suggested that
alters force transmission towards physiological conditions while preserving the
geometries of the standard plate-stem endoprosthesis design. The key aspect is
that the axial force is predominantly transmitted through the plate into
proximal bone which requires a compliant bone-stem interface as realized by
sliding friction conditions at a low friction coefficient. These interface
conditions avoid stress shielding almost completely, preserve pre-surgery bone
loading such that bone resorption is not likely to occur.

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is important as these stars play a vital
role in the chemical life cycle of galaxies. The general hypothesis of their
mass loss mechanism is a combination of stellar pulsations and radiative
pressure on dust grains. However, current models simplify dust formation, which
starts as a microscopic phase transition called nucleation. Various nucleation
theories exist, yet all assume chemical equilibrium, growth restricted by
monomers, and commonly use macroscopic properties for a microscopic process.
Such simplifications for initial dust formation can have large repercussions on
the type, amount, and formation time of dust. By abandoning equilibrium
assumptions, discarding growth restrictions, and using quantum mechanical
properties, we have constructed and investigated an improved nucleation theory
in AGB wind conditions for four dust candidates, TiO$_2$, MgO, SiO and
Al$_2$O$_3$. This paper reports the viability of these candidates as first dust
precursors and reveals implications of simplified nucleation theories. Monomer
restricted growth underpredicts large clusters at low temperatures and
overpredicts formation times. Assuming the candidates are present, Al$_2$O$_3$
is the favoured precursor due to its rapid growth at the highest considered
temperatures. However, when considering an initially atomic chemical mixture,
only TiO$_2$-clusters form. Still, we believe Al$_2$O$_3$ to be the prime
candidate due to substantial physical evidence in presolar grains, observations
of dust around AGB stars at high temperatures, and its ability to form at high
temperatures and expect the missing link to be insufficient quantitative data
of Al-reactions.

expansion method that directly expands the expectation value of payoff function
with respect to the volatility of volatility, then uses it to price options in
the stochastic volatility model. In this paper, we apply their method to the
stochastic volatility model with stochastic interest rates, and present the
expansion formula for pricing options up to the second order. Then the
numerical studies are performed to compare our approximation formula with the

Technically, we show that DTML semantics can represent a popular class of

As complete reduction axioms systems exist for DTML, this yields a complete

particular astrophysical object, the black hole. We then derive the kinetic
equations of a large system of particles including the entropy force. It adds a
collective therefore integral term to the Klimontovich equation for the
evolution of the one-particle distribution function. Its integral character
transforms the basic one particle kinetic equation into an integro-differential
equation already on the elementary level, showing that not only the microscopic
forces but the hole system reacts to its evolution of its probability
distribution in a holistic way. It also causes a collisionless dissipative term
which however is small in the inverse particle number and thus negligible.
However it contributes an entropic collisional dissipation term. The latter is
defined via the particle correlations but lacks any singularities and thus is
large scale. It allows also for the derivation of a kinetic equation for the
entropy density in phase space. This turns out to be of same structure as the
equation for the phase space density. The entropy density determines itself
holistically via the integral entropy force thus providing a self-controlled

along practically the whole electromagnetic spectrum. The sub-class of X-ray
transient sources show multifrequency behaviour which deserve particular
attention in order to understand the causing physics. These binary systems
consist of a compact star and an optical star, therefore there is a mutual
influence between these two stars that drive the low energy (LE) (i.e. radio,
IR, optical) and high energy (HE) (i.e. UV, X-ray, $\gamma$-ray) processes. The
LE processes are produced mostly on the optical star and the HE processes
mostly on the compact star, typically a neutron star. Thus it appears evident
that through the study of LE processes it is possible to understand also the HE
processes and vice versa. In this paper we will discuss this problem starting
from the experimental evidence of a delay between LE and HE processes detected
for the first time in the X-ray/Be system A0535+26/HDE245770 (e.g. Giovannelli
\& Sabau-Graziati, 2011; Giovannelli, Bisnovatyi-Kogan \& Klepnev, 2013 (here
after GBK13); Giovannelli et al., 2015b). This delay is common in cataclysmic
variables (CVs) and other binary systems with either a neutron star or a black
hole.
  Since a delay between LE processes and HE processes has been experimentally
observed in several active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we will discuss also the
tidal disruption of stars by massive BHs, following the original idea of Rees
(1998): stars in galactic nuclei can be captured or tidally disrupted by a
central black hole. Some debris would be ejected at high speed, the remainder
would be swallowed by the hole, causing a bright flare lasting at most a few
years.

properties of the most luminous quasars ($L_{bol}>10^{47}$ erg/s, $1.8<z<4.6$).
Nuclear winds are manifested as UV broad ($\geq$ 2,000 km/s) absorption lines
(BAL) in $\sim$ 15\% of quasars. We aim at studying the incidence and
properties of such winds in the WISSH sample, to investigate possible
differences with respect to lower luminosity AGN regimes. We collected optical
spectra from the SDSS data release 12, and identified those showing absorption
troughs in the region between \siiv and \civ emission lines. We find a higher
observed fraction of \civ BAL quasars in the WISSH sample (24\%) with respect
to previous catalogues (10-15\%). These WISSH BAL quasars are also
characterized by a larger average BI ($\sim$4,000 km/s) and maximum velocity
($\sim$17,000 km/s). Moreover, for two objects we discovered BAL features
bluewards of the \siiv peak, which can be associated to \civ absorption with
velocity of 0.15c. Finally, we updated previous studies on the dependence of
maximum outflow velocity upon bolometric luminosity, showing that BAL winds
have intermediate properties compared to molecular/ionized winds and ultra fast
outflows (UFOs). Finally, the radio properties of the WISSH BAL quasars as a
whole are in line with those of samples at lower luminosities from previous
studies. Our results suggest that the higher $L_{\rm bol}$ of the WISSH quasars
likely favours the acceleration of BAL outflows and that their most likely
driving mechanism is radiation pressure. Furthermore we estimate that the
kinetic power associated to these winds in hyperluminous quasars is sufficient,
for the highest column density and fastest winds, to provide efficient feedback
onto the host galaxy.

handles, network connections, or dynamically allocated memory. Programmers need
to follow certain protocols to handle these resources correctly. Violating
these protocols causes bugs ranging from type mismatches over data races to
use-after-free errors and memory leaks. These bugs often lead to security

  While statically typed programming languages guarantee type soundness and
memory safety by design, most of them do not address issues arising from
improper handling of resources. An important step towards handling resources is
the adoption of linear and affine types that enforce single-threaded resource

annotations.
  We present Affe, an extension of ML that manages linearity and affinity
properties using kinds and constrained types. In addition Affe supports the

high CO content ($>$0.01M$_\oplus$). These high CO masses imply a highly

few papers systematically studying the evolution of the mean curvature flow

paper. First, in order to consider various random initial conditions, we design
several benchmark problems with topological changes, and we find different
patterns of the evolutions of the solutions can be obtained if the interaction
length (width of the interface) is slightly changed, which is different from
the problems without topological changes. Second, we propose an energy
penalized minimization algorithm which works very well for these benchmark
problems, and thus furthermore, for the problems with random initial

is critical for their exploitation in nanoelectronic devices. While
ferroelectricity has been studied for nearly a century, major discrepancies in
the reported values of coercive fields and saturation polarization persist in
literature for many materials. This raises questions about the atomic-scale
mechanisms behind polarization reversal. Unconventional ferroelectric switching
in $\epsilon$-Fe2O3 films, a material that combines ferrimagnetism and
ferroelectricity at room temperature, is reported here. High-resolution in-situ
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments and
first-principles calculations demonstrate that polarization reversal in
$\epsilon$-Fe2O3 occurs around pre-existing domain walls only, triggering local
domain wall motion in moderate electric fields of 250 - 500 kV/cm. Calculations
indicate that the activation barrier for switching at domain walls is nearly a
quarter of that corresponding to the most likely transition paths inside
$\epsilon$-Fe2O3 domains. Moreover, domain walls provide symmetry lowering,
which is shown to be necessary for ferroelectric switching. Local polarization
reversal in $\epsilon$-Fe2O3 limits the macroscopic ferroelectric response and
offers important hints on how to tailor ferroelectric properties by domain
structure design in other relevant ferroelectric materials.

a promising approach toward the steep-slope field-effect-transistor (FET). In
addition to the selection of source material with desired density of
states-energy relation (D(E)), engineering the source: channel interface for
gate-tunable channel-barrier is crucial to a CS-FET. However, conventional
metal: semiconductor (MS)-interfaces generally suffer from strong
Fermi-level-pinning due to the inevitable chemical disorder and defect-induced
gap states, precluding the gate-tunability of the barriers. By comprehensive
materials and device modeling at the atomic-scale, we report that the
two-dimensional (2D)-van der Waals (vdW)-MS-interfaces, with their atomic
sharpness and cleanness, can be considered as general ingredients for CS-FETs.
As test cases, InSe-based n-type FETs are studied. It is found that graphene
can be spontaneously p-type doped along with slightly opened bandgap around the
Dirac-point by interfacing with InSe, resulting in super-exponentially decaying
hot carrier density with increasing n-type channel-barrier. Moreover, the D(E)
relations suggest that 2D-transition-metal-dichalcogenides and
2D-transition-metal-carbides are rich libraries of CS materials. Both graphene
and H-TaTe2 CSs lead to subthreshold swing below 60 mV/decade. This work
broadens the application potentials of 2D-vdW-MS-heterostructures and serves as
a springboard for more studies on low-power electronics based on 2D materials.

larger, as multiple scattering introduces extra complexities including
occultation effects. The addition of a gaussian spot does not alter the shape

that, for ${\rm S/N}_{\rm pix}\ge 50$, the typical internal abundance precision

carried out at particle colliders to produce the quark-gluon plasma, a state of
matter where quarks and gluons are not confined into hadrons, and colour
degrees of freedom are liberated. This state is thought to be produced as a
transient phenomenon before it fragments into thousands of particles that reach
the particle detectors. Despite two decades of investigations, one of the big
open questions is to obtain an experimental determination of the temperature
reached in a heavy-ion collision, and a simultaneous determination of another
thermodynamic quantity, such as the entropy density, that would give access to
the number of degrees of freedom. Here we obtain the first such determination,
utilizing state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations. We define an effective
temperature, averaged over the space-time evolution of the medium. Then, using
experimental data, we determine this temperature, the corresponding entropy
density and speed of sound in the matter created in lead-lead collisions at the
Large Hadron Collider. Our results agree with first-principles calculations
from lattice quantum chromodynamics and confirm that a deconfined phase of
matter is indeed produced.

friend experiments. A framework in which all the experimental outcomes arise
from unitary evolutions is proposed. Within it, a measurement is not completed
until an uncontrolled environment monitorizes the state composed by the system,
the apparatus and the observer. The (apparent) wave-function collapse and the
corresponding randomness result from tracing out this environment; it is thus
the ultimate responsible for the emergence of definite outcomes. Two main
effects arise from this fact. First, external interference measurements,
trademark of Wigner's friend experiments, modify the memory records of the
internal observers; this framework provides a univocal protocol to calculate
all these changes. Second, it can be used to build a consistent scenario for
the recenly proposed extended versions of the Wigner's friend experiment.
Regarding [D. Frauchiger and R. Renner, {\em Quantum theory cannot consistently
describe the use of itself}, Nat. Comm. {\bf 9}, 3711 (2018)], this framework
shows that the agents' claims become consistent if the changes in their
memories are properly taken into account. Furthermore, the particular setup
discussed in [C. Brukner, {\em A no-go theorem for observer-indepdendent
facts}, Entropy {\bf 20}, 350 (2018)] cannot be tested against the decoherence
framework, because it does not give rise to well-defined outcomes according to
this formalism. A variation of this setup, devised to fill this gap, makes it
possible to assign joint truth values to the observations made by all the
agents. This framework also narrows down the requisites for such experiments,
making them virtually impossible to apply to conscious (human) beings.
Notwithstanding, it also opens the door to future relizations on quantum
machines.

biological and/or single-particle systems. However, as far as their predictions
are concerned these approaches are not unique, often build on conceptually
orthogonal ideas, and are typically employed on an ad hoc basis. It therefore
seems timely and desirable to establish a systematic, mathematically unifying
and clean approach starting from more fine-grained principles. Here we analyze
projection-induced ergodic non-Markovian dynamics, both reversible as well as
irreversible, using spectral theory. We investigate dynamical correlations
between histories of projected and latent observables that give rise to memory
in projected dynamics, and rigorously establish conditions under which
projected dynamics is Markovian or renewal. A systematic metric is proposed for
quantifying the degree of non-Markovianity. As a simple, illustrative but
non-trivial example we study single file diffusion in a tilted box, which, for
the first time, we solve exactly using the coordinate Bethe ansatz. Our results
provide a solid foundation for a deeper and more systematic analysis of

recognize the visual instances from the novel classes via constructing the
interactions between the visual and the semantic modalities. In contrast to the
traditional image classification, ZSC is easily suffered from the
class-imbalance issue since it is more concerned with the class-level knowledge
transfer capability. In the real world, the class samples follow a long-tailed
distribution, and the discriminative information in the sample-scarce seen
classes is hard to be transferred to the related unseen classes in the
traditional batch-based training manner, which degrades the overall
generalization ability a lot. Towards alleviating the class imbalance issue in
ZSC, we propose a sample-balanced training process to encourage all training
classes to contribute equally to the learned model. Specifically, we randomly
select the same number of images from each class across all training classes to
form a training batch to ensure that the sample-scarce classes contribute
equally as those classes with sufficient samples during each iteration.
Considering that the instances from the same class differ in class
representativeness, we further develop an efficient semantics-guided feature
fusion model to obtain discriminative class visual prototype for the following
visual-semantic interaction process via distributing different weights to the
selected samples based on their class representativeness. Extensive experiments
on three imbalanced ZSC benchmark datasets for both the Traditional ZSC (TZSC)

promising results especially for the unseen categories those are closely

  registration: evaluation on longitudinal white matter tract changes","MICCAI 2019 (oral presentation)",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To accurately analyze changes of anatomical structures in longitudinal
imaging studies, consistent segmentation across multiple time-points is
required. Existing solutions often involve independent registration and
segmentation components. Registration between time-points is used either as a
prior for segmentation in a subsequent time point or to perform segmentation in
a common space. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid convolutional neural
network (CNN) that integrates segmentation and registration into a single
procedure. We hypothesize that the joint optimization leads to increased
performance on both tasks. The hybrid CNN is trained by minimizing an
integrated loss function composed of four different terms, measuring
segmentation accuracy, similarity between registered images, deformation field
smoothness, and segmentation consistency. We applied this method to the
segmentation of white matter tracts, describing functionally grouped axonal
fibers, using N=8045 longitudinal brain MRI data of 3249 individuals. The
proposed method was compared with two multistage pipelines using two existing
segmentation methods combined with a conventional deformable registration
algorithm. In addition, we assessed the added value of the joint optimization
for segmentation and registration separately. The hybrid CNN yielded
significantly higher accuracy, consistency and reproducibility of segmentation
than the multistage pipelines, and was orders of magnitude faster. Therefore,
we expect it can serve as a novel tool to support clinical and epidemiological
analyses on understanding microstructural brain changes over time.

effectively identify network traffic has become a top priority in the field.
Accurate identification of the network traffic is the footstone of basic
network services, say QoE, bandwidth allocation, and IDS. Previous
identification methods either cannot deal with encrypted traffics or require
experts to select tons of features to attain a relatively decent accuracy.In
this paper, we present a Deep Learning based end-to-end network traffic
identification framework, termed TEST, to avoid the aforementioned problems.
CNN and LSTM are combined and implemented to help the machine automatically
extract features from both special and time-related features of the raw
traffic. The presented framework has two layers of structure, which made it
possible to attain a remarkable accuracy on both encrypted traffic
classification and intrusion detection tasks. The experimental results
demonstrate that our model can outperform previous methods with a
state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.98%.

communication capacity in dense wireless networks. One of the most important
concerns for network designers is maintaining the high performance of the
network when the quality of connections between sources and their destinations
is poor. Thus the careful selection of relays between data sources and their
destinations is a very important issue. The possibility of simultaneous use of
different Radio Frequency (RF) interfaces for transmitting data, which
communication devices are equipped with them, can increase the capacity of data
transmission over the network. In this paper, two novel M2M relay selection
algorithms are proposed, named as Optimal Relay Selection Algorithm (ORSA) and
Matching based Relay Selection Algorithm (MRSA). ORSA is a centralized
algorithm for the optimal selection of relays by transforming the main problem
to a k-cardinality assignment problem that can be solved using the Hungarian
algorithm. MRSA is a distributed algorithm that leverages concepts from
matching theory to provide a stable solution for the relay selection problem.
In both proposed algorithms static RF interfaces usage is applied to enable
simultaneous use of different interfaces for data transmission. The simulations
show that ORSA is optimally solving the relay selection problem. MRSA has an
optimal stable result, that when there is no restriction on the number of
channels, is only about 1% lower than ORSA. Besides, MRSA provides better
results than direct transmission Without any Relay Selection Algorithm (WRSA)
and Random Relay Selection Algorithm (RRSA), about 15% and 98%, respectively.

sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sessile droplets on hydrophobic surfaces were
experimentally investigated for SDS concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 1 CMC.
In contrast to the constant contact angle of an evaporating sessile water
droplet, we observed that, at the same surface the contact angle of an SDS
laden droplet with a concentration below 0.5 CMC first decreases, then
increases, and finally decreases resulting in a local contact angle minimum.
Surprisingly, the minimum contact angle was found to be substantially lower

SDS concentration. Furthermore, the bulk SDS concentration at the local contact
angle minimum was found to decrease with a decrease in the initial SDS
concentration. The location of the observed contact angle minimum relative to
the normalized evaporation time and its minimum value proved to be independent
of both the relative humidity and the droplet volume and thus, of the total

videos. Therefore, this presents weakness and the discovery of these
researches, since additional training samples have to be found from diverse
videos. This paper will investigate diverse scene crowd analytics with
traditional and deep learning models. We will also consider pros and cons of
these approaches. However, once general deep methods are investigated from
large datasets, they can be consider to investigate different crowd videos and
images. Therefore, it would be able to cope with the problem including to not
limited to crowd density estimation, crowd people counting, and crowd event
recognition. Deep learning models and approaches are required to have large
datasets for training and testing. Many datasets are collected taking into
account many different and various problems related to building crowd datasets,
including manual annotations and increasing diversity of videos and images. In
this paper, we will also propose many models of deep neural networks and
training approaches to learn the feature modeling for crowd analytics.

surveillance applications is addressed. A novel Semantic Entry-Exit matching
model that makes use of ancillary information about subjects such as height,
build, complexion and clothing color to endorse exit of every subject who had
entered private area is proposed in this paper. The proposed method is robust
to variations in clothing. Each describing attribute is given equal weight
while computing the matching score and hence the proposed model achieves high
rank-k accuracy on benchmark datasets. The soft biometric traits used as a
combination though cannot achieve high rank-1 accuracy, it helps to narrow down
the search to match using reliable biometric traits such as gait and face whose
learning and matching time is costlier when compared to the visual soft
biometrics.

its high complexity as well as requiring perfect channel state information.
Although conventional blind detection techniques reduce complexity, they
degrade performance and require blind channel state information. In this paper
(for the first time), a deep learning based blind detection and a joint blind
detection-constellation shaping structure are presented (to solve this
problem). This paper (deeply) goes through the problem and discusses several
(practical) scenarios, including single user, multiuser with resource (channel)
allocation, and multiuser without resource allocation (multiuser interference).
In order to show the universality of the proposed systems, wide atmospheric
turbulence regimes, from weak to strong are considered, and single input single
output, as well as multi-input multi-output structures are considered. Results
indicate that without channel estimation, a deep learning based (blind)
detector (despite its very few complexity, and despite conventional systems
require it), could have a very favorable performance at all around. So, it is
expected that practical implementations of the proposed structures greatly
reduce cost, and processing latency, while maintaining performance close enough
to the outstanding conventional systems.

locations and classes of objects detected from Mask R-CNN during mobile robot
navigation. The objectness score is defined to measure how well the detector
identifies the locations and classes of objects during navigation.
Specifically, it is designed to increase when there is sufficient distance
between a detected object and the camera. During the navigation process, we
transform the locations of objects in 3D world coordinates into 2D image
coordinates through an affine projection and decide whether to retain the
classes of detected objects using the objectness score. We conducted
experiments to determine how well the locations and classes of detected objects
are maintained at various angles and positions. Experimental results showed
that our approach is efficient and robust, regardless of changing angles and
distances.

common because of the inappropriate ringing notifications of incoming phone
calls in different contexts. Such interruptions may impact on the work
attention not only for the mobile phone owners but also the surrounding people.
Decision tree is the most popular machine learning classification technique
that is used in existing context-aware mobile intelligent interruption
management (MIIM) model to overcome such issues. However, a single decision
tree based context-aware model may cause overfitting problem and thus decrease
the prediction accuracy of the inferred model. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose an ensemble machine learning based context-aware mobile telephony model
for the purpose of intelligent interruption management by taking into account
multi-dimensional contexts and name it ""E-MIIM"". The experimental results on
individuals' real life mobile telephony datasets show that our E-MIIM model is
more effective and outperforms existing MIIM model for predicting and managing
individual's mobile telephony interruptions based on their relevant contextual
information.

and the recent advanced features in the most popular IoT device, i.e.,
smartphone, modeling and predicting personalized usage behavior based on
relevant contexts can be highly useful in assisting them to carry out daily
routines and activities. Usage patterns of different categories smartphone apps
such as social networking, communication, entertainment, or daily life services
related apps usually vary greatly between individuals. People use these apps
differently in different contexts, such as temporal context, spatial context,
individual mood and preference, work status, Internet connectivity like Wifi?
status, or device related status like phone profile, battery level etc. Thus,
we consider individuals' apps usage as a multi-class context-aware problem for
personalized modeling and prediction. Random Forest learning is one of the most
popular machine learning techniques to build a multi-class prediction model.
Therefore, in this paper, we present an effective context-aware smartphone apps
prediction model, and name it ""AppsPred"" using random forest machine learning
technique that takes into account optimal number of trees based on such
multi-dimensional contexts to build the resultant forest. The effectiveness of
this model is examined by conducting experiments on smartphone apps usage
datasets collected from individual users. The experimental results show that
our AppsPred significantly outperforms other popular machine learning
classification approaches like ZeroR, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support
Vector Machines, Logistic Regression while predicting smartphone apps in
various context-aware test cases.

dynamically manipulated by controlling the refractive index of liquid mixture

numerically investigated by employing the beam propagation method (BPM). The
simulated results demonstrate that large dynamic range and low optical loss for
both TE and TM mode can be easily achieved, and furthermore the dependence of
polarization states and operation wavelength is very low in our designed

simple structure and large fabrication tolerance. Accordingly, our proposed
device offers a new approach for manipulation of optical power output, which
has wide potential application in optofluidic systems.
