impurities show a non-trivial, glassy dynamical critical behavior. Their proper
theoretical description requires the functional renormalization group. We show
that their critical behavior close to the depinning transition is related to a
much simpler model, $O(n)$-symmetric $\phi^4$ theory in the unusual limit of
$n\to -2$. We demonstrate that both theories yield identical results to 4-loop
order and give both a perturbative and a non-perturbative proof of their
equivalence. As we show, both theories can be used to describe loop-erased
random walks (LERWs), the trace of a random walk where loops are erased as soon
as they are formed. Remarkably, two famous models of non-self-intersecting
random walks, self-avoiding walks (SAWs) and LERWs, can both be mapped onto
$\phi^4$ theory taken, with formally $n=0$ and $n\to -2$ components. This
mapping allows us to compute the dynamic critical exponent of CDWs at the
depinning transition and the fractal dimension of LERWs in $d=3$ with
unprecedented accuracy, $z(d=3)= 1.6243 \pm 0.001$, in excellent agreement with
the estimate $z = 1.624 00 \pm 0.00005$ of numerical simulations.

chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms. Here we focus on robustness with
respect to tuning parameters, showing that more sophisticated algorithms tend
to be more sensitive to the choice of step-size parameter and less robust to
heterogeneity of the distribution of interest. We characterise this phenomenon
by studying the behaviour of spectral gaps as an increasingly poor step-size is
chosen for the algorithm. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a novel
and simple gradient-based MCMC algorithm, inspired by the classical Barker
accept-reject rule, with improved robustness properties. Extensive theoretical
results, dealing with robustness to tuning, geometric ergodicity and scaling
with dimension, suggest that the novel scheme combines the robustness of simple
schemes with the efficiency of gradient-based ones. We show numerically that
this type of robustness is particularly beneficial in the context of adaptive
MCMC, giving examples where our proposed scheme significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives.

system-spanning clusters. For sufficiently short rods, percolation in the

  We then focus on the special case of the problems when the queries are
offline and the number of queries is linear. We show that our range query
problems are runtime-equivalent (up to polylogarithmic factors) to counting for
each edge $e$ in an $m$-edge graph the number of triangles through $e$. This
natural triangle problem can be solved using the best known triangle counting
algorithm, running in $O(m^{2\omega/(\omega+1)}) \leq O(m^{1.41})$ time.
Moreover, if $\omega=2$, the $O(m^{2\omega/(\omega+1)})$ running time is known
to be tight (within $m^{o(1)}$ factors) under the 3SUM Hypothesis. In this
case, our equivalence settles the complexity of the range query problems. Our
problems constitute the first equivalence class with this peculiar running time
bound.
  To better understand the complexity of these problems, we also provide a
deeper insight into the family of triangle problems, in particular showing
black-box reductions between triangle listing and per-edge triangle detection
and counting. As a byproduct of our reductions, we obtain a simple triangle

enables simple and effective predictors in a range of vision tasks involving
spatially structured maps. Our key idea is to map small image elements to
feature representations extracted from a sequence of nested regions of
increasing spatial extent. These regions are obtained by ""zooming out"" from the
pixel/superpixel all the way to scene-level resolution, and hence we call these
zoom-out features. Applied to semantic segmentation and other structured
prediction tasks, our approach exploits statistical structure in the image and
in the label space without setting up explicit structured prediction
mechanisms, and thus avoids complex and expensive inference. Instead image
elements are classified by a feedforward multilayer network with skip-layer
connections spanning the zoom-out levels. When used in conjunction with modern
neural architectures such as ResNet, DenseNet and NASNet (to which it is
complementary) our approach achieves competitive accuracy on segmentation
benchmarks.
  In addition, we propose an approach for learning category-level semantic
segmentation purely from image-level classification tag. It exploits
localization cues that emerge from training a modified zoom-out architecture
tailored for classification tasks, to drive a weakly supervised process that
automatically labels a sparse, diverse training set of points likely to belong
to classes of interest. Finally, we introduce data-driven regularization
functions for the supervised training of CNNs. Our innovation takes the form of
a regularizer derived by learning an autoencoder over the set of annotations.

volume of $O(k)$ bits, with a randomized protocol that takes $O(\log^* k)$
rounds. Aside from rounds and communication volume, there is a \emph{third}
parameter of interest, namely the \emph{error probability} $p_{\mathrm{err}}$.
It is straightforward to show that protocols for Set Intersection or Equality
Testing need to send $\Omega(k + \log p_{\mathrm{err}}^{-1})$ bits. Is it
possible to simultaneously achieve optimality in all three parameters, namely
$O(k + \log p_{\mathrm{err}}^{-1})$ communication and $O(\log^* k)$ rounds? In
this paper we prove that there is no universally optimal algorithm, and
complement the existing round-communication tradeoffs with a new tradeoff
between rounds, communication, and probability of error. In particular:
  1. Any protocol for solving Multiple Equality Testing in $r$ rounds with
failure probability $2^{-E}$ has communication volume $\Omega(Ek^{1/r})$.
  2. There exists a protocol for solving Multiple Equality Testing in $r +

matching our lower bound and that of Sa\u{g}lam and Tardos.

the data for the current one is available. We address this problem of continual
learning for VAEs. It is known that the choice of the prior distribution over
the latent space is crucial for VAE in the non-continual setting. We argue that
it can also be helpful to avoid catastrophic forgetting. We learn the
approximation of the aggregated posterior as a prior for each task. This
approximation is parametrised as an additive mixture of distributions induced
by encoder evaluated at trainable pseudo-inputs. We use a greedy boosting-like
approach with entropy regularisation to learn the components. This method
encourages components diversity, which is essential as we aim at memorising the
current task with the fewest components possible. Based on the learnable prior,
we introduce an end-to-end approach for continual learning of VAEs and provide
empirical studies on commonly used benchmarks (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, NotMNIST)

measure the quality of the balance between these characteristic functions, it
was proposed a relationship where power output and dissipation are evaluated in

""Compromise Function"" and only depends of a parameter that measures the quality

mentioned parameter to obtain the generalization of some different objective
functions (generalizations of ecological function, omega function and efficient
power), by demanding that these generalization parameters maximize the above
mentioned functions. In this work we demonstrate that this function can be used
directly as an objective function: the ""$P{\Phi}$-Compromise Function""
($C_{P\Phi}$), also that the operation modes corresponding to the maximum
Generalized Ecological Function, maximum Generalized Omega Function and maximum
Efficient power output, are special cases of the operation mode of maximum
$C_{P\Phi}$, having the same optimum high reduced temperature, then the
characteristic functions will be the same in any of the above three working

Here we show that, when a system with a strong symmetry is initialized in a

stochastic trajectory will randomly select a single one of them and remain
there for the rest of the evolution. Since a strong symmetry implies a
conservation law for the corresponding symmetry operator on the ensemble level,
this selection of a single sector from an initial superposition entails a
breakdown of this conservation law at the level of individual realizations.
Given that such a superposition is impossible in a classical, stochastic
trajectory, this is a a purely quantum effect with no classical analogue. Our
results show that a system with a closed Liouvillian gap may exhibit, when
monitored over a single run of an experiment, a behaviour completely opposite

predictions of high-pT RAA and v2 observables. Contrary to common expectations,
we obtain that high-pT v2 is insensitive to the initial stages of medium
evolution, being unable to discriminate between different conditions. On the
other hand, RAA is sensitive to these conditions, however, within the current
errorbars, the sensitivity is not sufficient to distinguish between different
initial stages. Moreover, we also reconsider the validity of widely-used
procedure of fitting the energy loss parameters, individually for different
initial-stage cases, to reproduce the experimentally observed RAA. We here find
that previously reported sensitivity of v2 to different initial states is
mainly a consequence of the RAA fitting procedure, which may lead to incorrect
conclusions. On the other hand, if a global property, in particular the same
average temperature, is imposed to tested temperature profiles, high
sensitivity of high-pT v2 is again obtained. We however show that this
sensitivity would not be a consequence of differences in initial, but rather
final, stages. Consequently, the simultaneous study of high-pT RAA and v2, with

origins. Despite an abundance of detections, their nature remains elusive. At
least a subset of FRBs is expected to repeat, as the daily FRB rate surpasses
that of any known cataclysmic event, which has been confirmed by observations.
One of the proposed mechanisms to generate repeating FRBs is supergiant pulses
from young and highly spinning NSs, in which case FRBs could inherit the
periodicity of their parent NS. Here we examine the consequences of such a
population of periodic fast radio bursts (PFRBs). We calculate the rate and
lifetime of PFRB progenitors, and find that each newly born highly spinning NS
has to emit a number $N_{\rm PFRB}\sim 10^2$ of bursts during its active

PFRB ""death line"" analogous to the pulsar one. We propose several tests of this

luminosity would decrease, due to the NS spin-down. Second, PFRBs may show
modest amounts of rotation measure, given the lack of expelled matter from the
pulsar, as opposed to the magnetar-sourced FRBs proposed to explain the first
repeater FRB 121102. As an example, we study whether the second confirmed
repeater (FRB 180814) is a PFRB, given the preference for an inter-pulse
separation of 13 ms within its sub-bursts. We show that, if confirmed, this
period would place FRB 180814 in a different category as FRB 121102. We develop
tests that would identify---and characterize---the prospective population of
PFRBs.

report an average error reduction with respect to FKP of $\sim$ 40$\%$ at $k \,

Chain analysis to determine the impact of these gains on several quantities
derived from $P^{(0)}_\alpha(k)$. If we push the measurement to scales $0.3 < k

mass-metallicity-SFR phase space that is missed in photometric surveys with
pre-selection like SDSS, i.e., we find galaxies that are actively forming stars

mitigation strategies. In this paper, we study the problem of switching between

detection by dynamic watermarking. This requires new theory because existing
results are not adequate to control or bound the behavior of sensor switching
strategies that use finite data. To overcome this, we develop new finite sample
hypothesis tests for dynamic watermarking in the case of bounded disturbances,
using the modern theory of concentration of measure for random matrices. Our
resulting switching strategy is validated with a simulation analysis in an
autonomous driving setting, which demonstrates the strong performance of our

have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is
accomplished by replacing softmax with $\alpha$-entmax: a differentiable
generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely
zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the $\alpha$

allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our
adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when

octave-spanning spectra, but with good conversion efficiency only at vastly
higher repetition rates in the 100s of GHz. Here, we bridge this efficiency gap
with resonant supercontinuum, allowing supercontinuum generation using input
pulses with an ultra-low 6 picojoule energy, and duration of 1 picosecond,
10-fold longer than what is typical. By applying synchronous pulse-driving to a
dispersion-engineered, low-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic chip microresonator, we
generate dissipative Kerr solitons with a strong dispersive wave, both bound to
the input pulse. This creates a smooth, flattened 2,200 line frequency comb,
with an electronically detectable repetition rate of 28 GHz, constituting the
largest bandwidth-line-count product for any microcomb generated to date.
Strikingly, we observe that solitons exist in a weakly bound state with the
input pulse, stabilizing their repetition rate, but simultaneously allowing
noise transfer from one to the other to be suppressed even for offset
frequencies 100 times lower than the linear cavity decay rate. We demonstrate
that this nonlinear filtering can be enhanced by pulse-driving asynchronously,
in order to preserve the coherence of the comb. Taken together, our work
establishes resonant supercontinuum as a promising route to broadband and
coherent spectra.

new tasks from the same distribution remains an open problem in meta-learning.
Typically, previous works have approached this issue either by attempting to
train a neural network that directly produces updates or by attempting to learn
better initialisations or scaling factors for a gradient-based update rule.
Both of these approaches pose challenges. On one hand, directly producing an
update forgoes a useful inductive bias and can easily lead to non-converging
behaviour. On the other hand, approaches that try to control a gradient-based
update rule typically resort to computing gradients through the learning
process to obtain their meta-gradients, leading to methods that can not scale
beyond few-shot task adaptation. In this work, we propose Warped Gradient
Descent (WarpGrad), a method that intersects these approaches to mitigate their
limitations. WarpGrad meta-learns an efficiently parameterised preconditioning
matrix that facilitates gradient descent across the task distribution.
Preconditioning arises by interleaving non-linear layers, referred to as
warp-layers, between the layers of a task-learner. Warp-layers are meta-learned
without backpropagating through the task training process in a manner similar
to methods that learn to directly produce updates. WarpGrad is computationally
efficient, easy to implement, and can scale to arbitrarily large meta-learning
problems. We provide a geometrical interpretation of the approach and evaluate
its effectiveness in a variety of settings, including few-shot, standard
supervised, continual and reinforcement learning.

discretizations offer a well established, compact representation that forms

physics with relatively few basis functions, these representations can suffer
from a quartic growth of the number of integrals. Recent results have shown
that, for some quantum and classical algorithms, moving to representations with
diagonal two-body operators can result in dramatically lower asymptotic costs,
even if the number of functions required increases significantly. We introduce
a way to interpolate between the two regimes in a systematic and controllable
manner, such that the number of functions is minimized while maintaining a
block diagonal structure of the two-body operator and desirable properties of
an original, primitive basis. Techniques are analyzed for leveraging the
structure of this new representation on quantum computers. Empirical results
for hydrogen chains suggest a scaling improvement from $O(N^{4.5})$ in
molecular orbital representations to $O(N^{2.6})$ in our representation for
quantum evolution in a fault-tolerant setting, and exhibit a constant factor
crossover at 15 to 20 atoms. Moreover, we test these methods using modern
density matrix renormalization group methods classically, and achieve excellent
accuracy with respect to the complete basis set limit with a speedup of 1-2
orders of magnitude with respect to using the primitive or Gaussian basis sets
alone. These results suggest our representation provides significant cost
reductions while maintaining accuracy relative to molecular orbital or strictly

behavior in 3D Navier-Stokes flows. Enstrophy serves as a convenient indicator
of the regularity of solutions to the Navier Stokes system --- as long as this
quantity remains finite, the solutions are guaranteed to be smooth and satisfy
the equations in the classical (pointwise) sense. However, there are no
estimates available with finite a priori bounds on the growth of enstrophy and
hence the regularity problem for the 3D Navier-Stokes system remains open. In
order to quantify the maximum possible growth of enstrophy, we consider a
family of PDE optimization problems in which initial conditions with prescribed
enstrophy $\mathcal{E}_0$ are sought such that the enstrophy in the resulting
Navier-Stokes flow is maximized at some time $T$. Such problems are solved
computationally using a large-scale adjoint-based gradient approach derived in
the continuous setting. By solving these problems for a broad range of values
of $\mathcal{E}_0$ and $T$, we demonstrate that the maximum growth of enstrophy
is in fact finite and scales in proportion to $\mathcal{E}_0^{3/2}$ as
$\mathcal{E}_0$ becomes large. Thus, in such worst-case scenario the enstrophy
still remains bounded for all times and there is no evidence for formation of
singularity in finite time. We also analyze properties of the Navier-Stokes
flows leading to the extreme enstrophy values and show that this behavior is
realized by a series of vortex reconnection events.

stochastic bifurcation upon the increasing ratio of the positive and negative

between positive and negative feedback loops. We discover that coupled

high level. In addition, we study two types of macroscopic limits of the
discrete chemical master equation model: the Kurtz limit applies to proteins
with large burst frequencies and the L\'{e}vy limit applies to proteins with
large burst sizes. We derive the analytic steady-state distributions of the
protein abundance in a coupled gene circuit for both the discrete model and its
two macroscopic limits, generalizing the results obtained in [Chaos 26:043108,

decentralized topology where at most half of the workers are competing for the
limited communication resources at any given time. Moreover, each worker
exchanges the locally trained model only with two neighboring workers, thereby
training a global model with a lower amount of communication overhead in each
exchange. We prove that GADMM converges to the optimal solution for convex loss
functions, and numerically show that it converges faster and more
communication-efficient than the state-of-the-art communication-efficient
algorithms such as the Lazily Aggregated Gradient (LAG) and dual averaging, in
linear and logistic regression tasks on synthetic and real datasets.

its convergence under the time-varying network topology of the workers.

introduced the notion of intrinsic density: a set has defined intrinsic density

Furthermore, Astor also introduced various notions of intrinsic computation in
which the standard coding tricks cannot be used to embed intrinsically
computable sets in every Turing degree. Our goal is to study the sets which are
intrinsically small, i.e. those that have intrinsic density zero. We begin by
studying which computable functions preserve intrinsic smallness. We also show
that intrinsic smallness and hyperimmunity are computationally independent

hyperimmune set which is ""as large as possible"" and therefore not intrinsically

experiments enable precise determination of both adsorption and desorption
rates. Strikingly the experimental data show anomalous desorption kinetics,
evident as a surface dwell time that exhibits a power-law distribution, i.e. a
heavy-tailed rather than the expected exponential distribution. As a direct
consequence of this heavy-tailed distribution, the average desorption rate
depends upon the time scale of the experiment and the protein surface
concentration does not reach equilibrium. Further analysis reveals that the
observed anomalous desorption emerges due to the reversible formation of a
small fraction of soluble protein multimers (small oligomers), such that each
one desorbs from the surface with a different rate. The overall kinetics can be
described by a series of elementary reactions, yielding simple scaling
relations that predict experimental observations. This work reveals a
mechanistic origin for anomalous desorption kinetics that can be employed to
interpret observations where low-protein fouling surfaces eventually foul when

users over a shared slotted medium enabling joint collision resolution and
decoding. Each user first encodes its information bits with an outer code for
reliability, and then transmits these coded bits with possible repetitions over
transmission time slots of the access channel. The transmission patterns are
dictated by the inner collision-resolution code and collisions with other
users' transmissions may occur. We analyze two types of codes for the outer
layer: long-blocklength LDPC codes, and short-blocklength algebraic codes. With
LDPC codes, a density evolution analysis enables joint optimization of both
outer and inner code parameters for maximum throughput. With algebraic codes,
we invoke a similar analysis by approximating their average erasure correcting
capability while assuming a large number of active transmitters. The proposed
low-complexity schemes operate at a significantly smaller gap to capacity than
the state of the art. Our schemes apply both to a multiple access scenario
where number of users within a frame is known a priori, and to a random access
scenario where that number is known only to the decoder. In the latter case, we
optimize an outage probability due to the variability in user activity.

decisions in high-stakes settings, such as medicine, criminal justice and
education. In each of these cases, the purpose of the risk assessment tool is
to inform actions, such as medical treatments or release conditions, often with
the aim of reducing the likelihood of an adverse event such as hospital
readmission or recidivism. Problematically, most tools are trained and
evaluated on historical data in which the outcomes observed depend on the
historical decision-making policy. These tools thus reflect risk under the
historical policy, rather than under the different decision options that the
tool is intended to inform. Even when tools are constructed to predict risk
under a specific decision, they are often improperly evaluated as predictors of
the target outcome.
  Focusing on the evaluation task, in this paper we define counterfactual
analogues of common predictive performance and algorithmic fairness metrics
that we argue are better suited for the decision-making context. We introduce a
new method for estimating the proposed metrics using doubly robust estimation.
We provide theoretical results that show that only under strong conditions can
fairness according to the standard metric and the counterfactual metric
simultaneously hold. Consequently, fairness-promoting methods that target
parity in a standard fairness metric may --- and as we show empirically, do ---
induce greater imbalance in the counterfactual analogue. We provide empirical
comparisons on both synthetic data and a real world child welfare dataset to
demonstrate how the proposed method improves upon standard practice.

is optimized using a specific alternating projections strategy over non-convex

tools from multidimensional multirate signal processing. This solves the slow
convergence issue of stochastic gradient-based methods while keeping a small

challenging component of a Speaker Diarization system are presented, i.e. the
speaker clustering part. A processing step is proposed enhancing the input
features with a temporal smoothing process combined with nonlinear filtering.
We, also, propose improvements on the Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) algorithm
-- a nonlinear feature transformation. The performance of these enhancements is
compared with different clustering algorithms, such as the UISRNN, k-Means,
Spectral clustering and x-Means. The evaluation is held on three different
tasks, i.e. the AMI, DIHARD and an internal meeting transcription task. The
proposed approaches assume a known number of speakers and time segmentations
for the audio files. Since, we focus only on the clustering component of
diarization for this work, the segmentation provided is assumed perfect.
Finally, we present how supervision, in the form of given speaker profiles, can
further improve the overall diarization performance. The proposed enhancements
yield substantial relative improvements in all 3 tasks, with 20\% in AMI and
19\% better than the best diarization system for DIHARD task, when the number
of speakers is known.

and radio emission of the star-forming galaxies. Observations have shown that
although scatter is present, this correlation holds over a range of redshifts
and does not evolve. However, there has been a number of more recent
observations, especially in higher redshift surveys, indicating the opposite.
The question that then presents itself is - what is driving this evolution? In
this work we explore the possibility that the answer might be hiding in
galactic interactions and revealed by morphology. We present a number of models
based on the evolving number of galaxies of different morphological types, some
of which could potentially explain observed trends and scatter in general.
Furthermore, we analyze a small sample of 34 submillimeter galaxies whose
observations have been published and morphology classified. In this sample we
look at the FIR-radio correlation separately in galaxies of different
morphological types. We find that, while for both disk and irregular
star-forming galaxies there are hints of evolution of this correlation with
redshift, where this evolution appears to be stronger in irregular galaxies,
due to low number statistics, both samples are also consistent with no
evolution, making it at this point, difficult to discriminate between models.
However, when analysis was performed on the combined sample, evolving and
decreasing trend was indeed found, indicating, that evolution should be
expected in at least one of the morphological types.

elucidating, and predicting the rates and mechanisms of many chemical and
biochemical processes. Here, we propose and investigate approaches to
accurately compute diabatic couplings from density functional theory (DFT)
using absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs). ALMOs provide an
appealing approach to generate variationally optimized diabatic states and
obtain their associated forces that allows for the relaxation of the donor and
acceptor orbitals in a way that is internally consistent in how the method
treats both the donor and acceptor states. Here, we show that one can obtain
more accurate electronic couplings between ALMO-based diabats by employing the
symmetrized transition density matrix to evaluate the exchange-correlation
contribution. We demonstrate that this approach yields accurate results in
comparison to other commonly used DFT-based diabatization methods across a wide
array of electron and hole transfer processes occurring in systems ranging from
conjugated organic molecules, such as thiophene and pentacene, to DNA base
pairs. We also show that this approach yields accurate diabatic couplings even
when combined with lower tiers of the DFT hierarchy, opening the door to
combining it with quantum dynamics approaches to provide an ab initio treatment
of nonadiabatic processes in the condensed phase.

natural language inference (NLI) tasks. However, as demonstrated in recent
literature, when tested on some simple adversarial examples, most of the models
suffer a significant drop in performance. This raises the concern about the
robustness of NLI models. In this paper, we propose to make NLI models robust
by incorporating external knowledge to the attention mechanism using a simple
transformation. We apply the new attention to two popular types of NLI models:
one is Transformer encoder, and the other is a decomposable model, and show
that our method can significantly improve their robustness. Moreover, when
combined with BERT pretraining, our method achieves the human-level performance
on the adversarial SNLI data set.

years and has profoundly changed the people's daily lives. However, in the
meantime, such a fast-growing technology has also introduced new privacy
issues, which need to be better understood and measured. In this work, we look
into how private information can be leaked from network traffic generated in
the smart home network. Although researchers have proposed techniques to infer
IoT device types or user behaviors under clean experiment setup, the
effectiveness of such approaches become questionable in the complex but
realistic network environment, where common techniques like Network Address and
Port Translation (NAPT) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) are enabled. Traffic
analysis using traditional methods (e.g., through classical machine-learning
models) is much less effective under those settings, as the features picked
manually are not distinctive any more. In this work, we propose a traffic
analysis framework based on sequence-learning techniques like LSTM and
leveraged the temporal relations between packets for the attack of device
identification. We evaluated it under different environment settings (e.g.,
pure-IoT and noisy environment with multiple non-IoT devices). The results
showed our framework was able to differentiate device types with a high
accuracy. This result suggests IoT network communications pose prominent
challenges to users' privacy, even when they are protected by encryption and
morphed by the network gateway. As such, new privacy protection methods on IoT
traffic need to be developed towards mitigating this new issue.

One key factor of BUC is the distance measurement strategy. Ideally, the
distance measurement should consider both inter-cluster and intra-cluster

a pair of the nearest sample between two clusters and ignores the diversity of
other samples in clusters. To solve this problem, we propose to use the energy
distance to evaluate both the inter-cluster and intra-cluster distance in
hierarchical clustering(E-cluster), and use the sum of squares of
deviations(SSD) as a regularization term to further balance the diversity and
similarity of energy distance evaluation. We evaluate our method on large scale

significantly. Designing durable stress sensors that are not affected by harsh

fundamental challenge. To address this problem, we developed a stress sensor

deflecting foreground galaxy is a typical early-type galaxy at a high redshift
of $z_{\ell} = 0.957$ with stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_v=259\pm56$

based on the sharp drop bluewards of Ly$\alpha$ and other absorption features.
A simple lens mass model for the system, assuming a singular isothermal
ellipsoid, yields an Einstein radius of $\theta_{\rm Ein} = 1.
23^{\prime\prime}$ and a total mass within the Einstein radius of $M_{\rm Ein}

automatically generate a caption for the video. Existing methods for video

been widely applied to boost the performance of video captioning models, but
existing networks often fail to provide meaningful semantic features. Second,
the Teacher Forcing algorithm is often utilized to optimize video captioning
models, but during training and inference, different strategies are applied to
guide word generation, leading to poor performance. Third, current video

(NAS), in designing neural network architectures has recently drawn
considerable attention. In this work, we present an efficient NAS approach,
named HM- NAS, that generalizes existing weight sharing based NAS approaches.
Existing weight sharing based NAS approaches still adopt hand-designed
heuristics to generate architecture candidates. As a consequence, the space of
architecture candidates is constrained in a subset of all possible
architectures, making the architecture search results sub-optimal. HM-NAS
addresses this limitation via two innovations. First, HM-NAS incorporates a
multi-level architecture encoding scheme to enable searching for more flexible
network architectures. Second, it discards the hand-designed heuristics and
incorporates a hierarchical masking scheme that automatically learns and
determines the optimal architecture. Compared to state-of-the-art weight
sharing based approaches, HM-NAS is able to achieve better architecture search
performance and competitive model evaluation accuracy. Without the constraint
imposed by the hand-designed heuristics, our searched networks contain more
flexible and meaningful architectures that existing weight sharing based NAS
approaches are not able to discover.

colors) light valence quarks bound by the pion mean fields that are created by
the presence of the $N_c-1$ valence quarks self-consistently, while the heavy
quark inside a singly heavy baryon is regarded as a static color source. We
investigate how the pion mean fields are created by the presence of $N_c$,
$N_c-1$, and $N_c-2$ light valence quarks, which correspond to the systems of
light baryons, singly heavy baryons, and doubly heavy baryons. As the number of
color decreases from $N_c$ to $N_c-1$, the pion mean fields undergo changes. As
a result, the valence-quark contributions to the moments of inertia of the
soliton become larger than the case of the $N_c$ valence quarks, whereas the
sea-quark contributions decrease systematically. On the other hand, the
presence of the $N_c-2$ valence quarks is not enough to produce the strong pion
mean fields, which leads to the fact that the classical soliton can not be
formed. It indicates that the pion mean-field approach is not suitable to
describe doubly heavy baryons. We show that the mass spectra of the singly
heavy baryons are better described by the improved pion mean fields, compared
with the previous work in which the pion mean fields are assumed to be intact
with $N_c$ varied.

caused by momentum transfer from the wind to the saltating particles. For our
poorly sorted sands, we find that these measurement methods yield different
threshold values because, at the smaller visual threshold, relatively coarse
particles do not participate in saltation. We further find that both methods
yield threshold values that are much larger (60--250\%) for our poorly sorted
sands than for our well-sorted sands with similar median particle diameter. In
particular, even a rescaling of the dynamic saltation threshold based on the
90th percentile particle diameter rather than the median diameter cannot fully

inhibit star formation in their host galaxies by injecting heat and turbulence
into the interstellar medium (ISM). To investigate jet-ISM interactions in a
galaxy with a young radio source, we have carried out a multi-wavelength study
of the $z = 0.025$ Compact Steep Spectrum radio source hosted by the early-type
galaxy UGC 05771. Using Keck/OSIRIS observations, we detected
H\textsubscript{2} 1--0 S(1) and [Fe \textsc{ii}] emission at radii of 100s of
pc, which traces shocked molecular and ionised gas being accelerated outwards
by the jets to low velocities, creating a `stalling wind'. At kpc radii, we
detected shocked ionised gas using observations from the CALIFA survey,
covering an area much larger than the pc-scale radio source. We found that
existing interferometric radio observations fail to recover a large fraction of
the source's total flux, indicating the likely existence of jet plasma on kpc
scales, which is consistent with the extent of shocked gas in the host galaxy.
To investigate the star formation efficiency in UGC 05771, we obtained IRAM CO
observations to analyse the molecular gas properties. We found that UGC 05771
sits below the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, although we were unable to
definitively conclude if direct interactions from the jets are inhibiting star
formation. This result shows that jets may be important in regulating star
formation in the host galaxies of compact radio sources.

re-representing discrete variables that are typically used in travel demand
modeling, such as mode, trip purpose, education level, family type or
occupation. This re-representation process essentially maps those variables
into a latent space called the \emph{embedding space}. The benefit of this is
that such spaces allow for richer nuances than the typical transformations used
in categorical variables (e.g. dummy encoding, contrasted encoding, principal
components analysis). While the usage of latent variable representations is not
new per se in travel demand modeling, the idea presented here brings several
innovations: it is an entirely data driven algorithm; it is informative and
consistent, since the latent space can be visualized and interpreted based on
distances between different categories; it preserves interpretability of
coefficients, despite being based on Neural Network principles; and it is
transferrable, in that embeddings learned from one dataset can be reused for
other ones, as long as travel behavior keeps consistent between the datasets.
  The idea is strongly inspired on natural language processing techniques,
namely the word2vec algorithm. Such algorithm is behind recent developments
such as in automatic translation or next word prediction. Our method is
demonstrated using a model choice model, and shows improvements of up to 60\%
with respect to initial likelihood, and up to 20% with respect to likelihood of
the corresponding traditional model (i.e. using dummy variables) in
out-of-sample evaluation. We provide a new Python package, called PyTre (PYthon
TRavel Embeddings), that others can straightforwardly use to replicate our
results or improve their own models. Our experiments are themselves based on an
open dataset (swissmetro).

In this work, we present a specialized accelerator architecture, EnGN, to

proposed EnGN is designed to accelerate the three key stages of GNN
propagation, which is abstracted as common computing patterns shared by typical

values of the electromagnetic field strength components in a coherent
wavepacket state of mean photon number unity. As such, we deal with real
quantities that have a physical meaning rather than complex amplitudes. It is
seen that the real parts of complex amplitudes proposed previously as measures
of localization are equal to our field expectations. With this measure, we
examine two test states. The first has a well-resolved momentum. The field
expectations show Gaussian (quadratic exponential) localization in all
directions, although the localization length scale is much larger than the mean
wavelength. For the other test state, with a spherically symmetric momentum
distribution, we find almost exponential localization in all directions at t =
0. The profiles are scale invariant, so choosing the momentum width very large
would make the localization length arbitrarily small. We conclude that there is
no lower bound on the localization length scale of a photon as determined by
this measure.

26-item multiple-choice instrument after learning about kinematics graphs in

approx. 3000 paired responses (accuracy and confidence) and about 40 hours of
eye movementdata (approx. 500.000 fixations). The analysis of students' visual
attention related to the item stems (questions) and the item options reveal
that high response confidence is correlated with shorter visit duration on both
elements of the items. While the students' response accuracy and their response
confidence are highly correlated on the score level, r(115) = 0.63, p < 0.001,
the eye-tracking measures do not sufficiently discriminate between correct and
incorrect responses. However, a more fine-grained analysis of visual attention
based on different answer options reveals a significant discrimination between
correct and incorrect answers in terms of an interaction effect: Incorrect
responses are associated with longer visit durations on strong distractors and
less time spent on correct options while correct responses show the opposite

properties of correlated metals such as spin, electron and lattice dynamics as
well as their mutual interactions. In this review we focus on electronic and
spin excitations in Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides in particular, but not
exclusively superconductors. After a general introduction to the basic theory
including the selection rules for the various scattering processes we provide
an overview over the major results. In the superconducting state below the
transition temperature Tc the pair-breaking effect can be observed, and the
energy gap can be derived. The energies can be associated with the gaps and
their anisotropy on the electron and hole bands. In spite of the similarities
of the overall band structures the results are strongly dependent on the family
and may even change qualitatively within one family. In some of the compounds
strong collective modes appear below Tc. In Ba1-xKxFe2As2, which has the most
isotropic gap of all Fe-based superconductors, there are indications that these
modes are exciton-like states appearing in the presence of a hierarchy of
pairing tendencies. The strong in-gap modes observed in Co-doped NaFeAs are
interpreted in terms of quadrupolar orbital excitations which become undamped
in the superconducting state. The doping dependence of the scattering intensity
in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 is associated with a nematic resonance above a quantum
critical point and interpreted in terms of a critical enhancement at the
maximal Tc. In the normal state the response from particle-hole excitations
reflects the resistivity. In addition, there are contributions from presumably
critical fluctuations in the energy range of kBT which can be compared to the
elastic properties. Currently it is not settled whether the fluctuations
observed by light scattering are related to spin or charge.

the Fermi level, where the effective masses of carriers are very close to zero

high-performance electronic devices. Herein, we have employed the genetic
algorithms methods combining with first-principles calculations to propose a
new 2D anisotropic Dirac cone material, that is, orthorhombic boron phosphide
(BP) monolayer named as borophosphene. Molecular dynamics simulation and phonon
dispersion have been used to evaluate the dynamic and thermal stability of
borophosphene. Because of the unique arrangements of B-B and P-P dimers, the
mechanical and electronic properties are highly anisotropic. Of great interest
is that the Dirac cone of the borophosphene is robust, independent of in-plane
biaxial and uniaxial strains, and can also be observed in its one-dimensional
(1D) zigzag nanoribbons and armchair nanotubes. The Fermi velocities are ~ 105
m/s, the same order of magnitude with that of graphene. By using a
tight-binding model, the origin of the Dirac cone of borophosphene is analyzed.
Moreover, a unique feature of self-doping can be induced by the in-plane
biaxial and uniaxial strains of borophosphene and the Curvature effect of
nanotubes, which is great beneficial to realizing high speed carriers (holes).
Our results suggest that the borophosphene holds a great promise in
high-performance electronic devices, which could promote the experimental and

of citation networks and their corresponding co-authorship networks. We explore
the interdependence between evolving citation and co-authorship networks
focused on the publications, by Indian authors, in American Physical Society
journals between 1970 and 2013. We record interactions between each possible
pair of authors in two ways: first, by tracing the change in citations they
exchanged and, second, by tracing the shortest path between authors in the
co-authorship network. We create these data for every year of the period of our
analysis. We use probability methods to quantify the correlation between
citations and shortest paths, and the effect on the dynamics of the
citation-co-authorship system. We find that author pairs who have a
co-authorship distance $d \leq 3$ significantly affect each others citations,
but that this effect falls off rapidly for longer distances in the
co-authorship network. The exchange of citation between pairs with $d=1$
exhibits a sudden increase at the time of first co-authorship events and decays
thereafter, indicating an aging effect in collaboration. This suggests that the
dynamics of the co-authorship network appear to be driving those of the
citation network rather than vice versa. Moreover, the majority of citations
received by most authors are due to reciprocal citations from current, or past,
co-authors. We conclude that, in order to answer questions on nature and
dynamics of scientific collaboration, it is necessary to study both
co-authorship and citation network simultaneously.

effectively analyze the massive volumes. Segmentation and landmark localization
are two key techniques in making the quantitative evaluation of prenatal
ultrasound volumes available in clinic. However, both tasks are non-trivial
when considering the poor image quality, boundary ambiguity and anatomical
variations in volumetric ultrasound. In this paper, we propose an effective
framework for simultaneous segmentation and landmark localization in prenatal
ultrasound volumes. The proposed framework has two branches where informative
cues of segmentation and landmark localization can be propagated
bidirectionally to benefit both tasks. As landmark localization tends to suffer
from false positives, we propose a distance based loss to suppress the noise
and thus enhance the localization map and in turn the segmentation. Finally, we
further leverage an adversarial module to emphasize the correspondence between
segmentation and landmark localization. Extensively validated on a volumetric
ultrasound dataset of fetal femur, our proposed framework proves to be a
promising solution to facilitate the interpretation of prenatal ultrasound
volumes.

which additive Gaussian stochastic force reproduces effects of thermal
fluctuations from the reservoir. When implemented for systems close to
equilibrium, the approach correctly explains emergence of Boltzmann
distribution for the ensemble of trajectories generated by Langevin equation

  This scenario can be further generalized to include effects of non-Gaussian,

between the strength of the friction and variance of the noise is violated.

the separation distance from the molecule. According to our metric, silver is

integral part of various intelligent systems, including autonomous vehicles,
robotics, and many others. Usually, visual information is captured by a
frame-based camera, converted into a digital format, and processed afterwards
using a machine learning algorithm such as an artificial neural network (ANN).
A large amount of (mostly redundant) data being passed through the entire
signal chain, however, results in low frame rates and large power consumption.
Various visual data preprocessing techniques have thus been developed that
allow to increase the efficiency of the subsequent signal processing in an ANN.
Here, we demonstrate that an image sensor itself can constitute an ANN that is
able to simultaneously sense and process optical images without latency. Our
device is based on a reconfigurable two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor
photodiode array, with the synaptic weights of the network being stored in a
continuously tunable photoresponsivity matrix. We demonstrate both supervised
and unsupervised learning and successfully train the sensor to classify and
encode images, that are optically projected onto the chip, with a throughput of
20 million bins per second.

understanding of star formation. Deuteration is a key chemical process in the
earliest stages of star formation because its efficiency is sensitive to the
environment. Using the IRAM-30 m telescope at 1.3--4.3 mm wavelengths, we have
imaged two parsec-scale high-mass protostellar clumps (P1 and S) that show
different evolutionary stages but are located in the same giant filamentary
{infrared dark cloud} G28.34+0.06. Deep spectral images at subparsec resolution
reveal the dust and gas physical structures of both clumps. We find that (1)
the low-$J$ lines of $\rm N_2H^+$, HCN, HNC, and $\rm HCO^+$ isotopologues are
subthermally excited; and (2) the deuteration of $\rm N_2H^+$ is more efficient
than that of $\rm HCO^+$, HCN, and HNC by an order of magnitude. The
deuterations of these species are enriched toward the chemically younger clump
S compared with P1, indicating that this process favors the colder and denser
environment ($\rm T_{kin} \sim14 K$, $\rm N(NH_3) \sim 9\times
10^{15}\,cm^{-2}$). In contrast, single deuteration of $\rm NH_3$ is
insensitive to the environmental difference between P1 and S; and (3) single
deuteration of $\rm CH_3OH$ ($\rm > 10\%$) is detected toward the location
where CO shows a depletion of $\sim10$. This comparative chemical study between
P1 and S links the chemical variations to the environmental differences and
shows chemical similarities between the early phases of high- and low-mass
star-forming regions.

rapidly recovered based on fine-tuning of pre-trained neural networks,

learning literature. In uncertainty sampling, which is among the most popular
approaches, the active learner sequentially queries the label of those
instances for which its current prediction is maximally uncertain. The
predictions as well as the measures used to quantify the degree of uncertainty,
such as entropy, are almost exclusively of a probabilistic nature. In this
paper, we advocate a distinction between two different types of uncertainty,
referred to as epistemic and aleatoric, in the context of active learning.
Roughly speaking, these notions capture the reducible and the irreducible part
of the total uncertainty in a prediction, respectively. We conjecture that, in
uncertainty sampling, the usefulness of an instance is better reflected by its
epistemic than by its aleatoric uncertainty. This leads us to suggest the
principle of ""epistemic uncertainty sampling"", which we instantiate by means of
a concrete approach for measuring epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In
experimental studies, epistemic uncertainty sampling does indeed show promising
performance.

Existing approaches use graph-based neural models with words as nodes and edges

target node representations. However, entity relations can be better expressed
through unique edge representations formed as paths between nodes. We thus
propose an edge-oriented graph neural model for document-level relation
extraction. The model utilises different types of nodes and edges to create a
document-level graph. An inference mechanism on the graph edges enables to
learn intra- and inter-sentence relations using multi-instance learning

Using fully re-trained GPT-2 models (without OpenAI pre-trained weights), we
assess the gain of applying a self-supervised pre-training phase with unlabeled

computational methods have been proposed to reconstruct a densely-sampled LF
from a sparsely-sampled one, they still suffer from either low reconstruction
quality, low computational efficiency, or the restriction on the regularity of
the sampling pattern. To this end, we propose a novel learning-based method,
which accepts sparsely-sampled LFs with irregular structures, and produces
densely-sampled LFs with arbitrary angular resolution accurately and
efficiently. We also propose a simple yet effective method for optimizing the
sampling pattern. Our proposed method, an end-to-end trainable network,
reconstructs a densely-sampled LF in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, the
coarse sub-aperture image (SAI) synthesis module first explores the scene
geometry from an unstructured sparsely-sampled LF and leverages it to
independently synthesize novel SAIs, in which a confidence-based blending
strategy is proposed to fuse the information from different input SAIs, giving
an intermediate densely-sampled LF. Then, the efficient LF refinement module
learns the angular relationship within the intermediate result to recover the
LF parallax structure. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the
superiority of our method on both real-world and synthetic LF images when
compared with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we illustrate the benefits

surface as a representation of the ciliatory propulsion and subsequently obtain
exact solution of the Stokes equation based on a combined analytical-numerical
approach. We illustrate how the near-wall swimming velocities are non-trivially
altered by the interaction of wall slip and hydrodynamic forces. We report a
characteristic transition of swimming trajectories for both puller and pusher
type microswimmers by hydrodynamic slippage if the wall-slip length crosses a
critical value. In case of puller microswimmers that are propelled by a
breast-stroke like action of their swimming apparatus ahead of their cell body,
the wall slip can cause wall-bound trapping swimming states, either as periodic
or damped periodic oscillations which would otherwise escape from a no slip
wall. The associated critical slip length has a non-monotonic dependence on the
initial orientation of the swimmer which is represented by novel phase
diagrams. Pushers, which get their propulsive thrust from posterior flagellar
action, also show similar swimming state transitions but in this case the wall
slip mediated reorientation dynamics and the swimming modes compete in a
different fashion to that of the pullers. The present results pave the way for

RefNet on three datasets, \textit{viz.}, SQuAD, HOTPOT-QA, and DROP, and show
that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 7-16\% on all of these
datasets. Lastly, we show that we can improve the quality of the second decoder
on specific metrics, such as, fluency and answerability by explicitly rewarding
revisions that improve on the corresponding metric during training. The code

cross-layer, and cross-system design paradigms. Recently, the ``curse of
modeling"" and ``curse of dimensionality"" of the cross-system design paradigm
have resulted in the popularity of using artificial intelligence (AI) to
optimize the Internet of information. However, many significant research
challenges remain to be addressed for the AI approach, including the lack of
high-quality training data due to privacy and resources constraints in this
data-driven approach. To address these challenges, we need to take a look at
humans' cooperation in a larger time scale. To facilitate cooperation in modern
history, we have built three major technologies: ``grid of transportation"",
``grid of energy"", and ``the Internet of information"". In this paper, we argue
that the next cooperation paradigm could be the ``Internet of intelligence
(Intelligence-Net)"", where intelligence can be easily obtained like energy and
information, enabled by the recent advances in blockchain technology. We
present some recent advances in these areas, and discuss some open issues and
challenges that need to be addressed in the future.

randomly distributed frequencies is studied when the natural frequency
distribution does not possess an even symmetry with respect to the average
natural frequency of oscillators. We study the special case of absence of
symmetry induced by a group of scaling transformations of the continuous
distribution of frequencies. When coupling between oscillators is increased
beyond a critical threshold favoring spontaneous synchronization, we found that
the variation in the velocity of the traveling wave depends on the extent of
asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution. In particular for large
coupling this velocity is the average natural frequency whereas at the onset of
synchronization it corresponds to the frequency where the Hilbert Transform of
the frequency distribution vanishes.

of force (F=MA) or inertial mass (M=F/A), assuming a definition of acceleration
and parallelism of force and acceleration. In the special theory of relativity,
out of these three only the description of force (F=dp/dt) does not raise
doubts. The greatest problems are posed by mass, which may be invariant rest
mass or relativistic mass or even directional mass like longitudinal mass. This
results from breaking the assumption of parallelism of force and standard
acceleration. It turns out that these issues disappear if the relativistic
acceleration A is defined as a relativistic velocity subtraction formula. This
basic fact is obscured by some subtlety related to the calculation of the
relativistic differential of velocity. It is based on the direction of force
rather than on transformation to a resting system. The reference to a
non-resting system generates a (seemingly) different velocity subtraction
formula. Thus, the relativistic three-dimensional acceleration is neither rest
acceleration, nor four-acceleration, nor standard acceleration. As a
consequence, inertial mass in any direction of the force has the same value as
relativistic mass. In other words, the concepts of transverse mass and
longitudinal mass, which depend on velocity, have been unified. In this work a
full relativistic equation is derived for the motion of a body with variable
mass whose form confirmed the previously introduced definitions. In addition,
these definitions are in line with the general version of the principle of mass
and energy equivalence. The work presents a detailed review and discussion of
different approaches to the subject in relation to original historical and
contemporary texts. On this basis, a proposal is made for consistent definition
of relativistic quantities associated with velocity change.

information transmission phase. We explore a fixed transmit rate scheme
designed to cope with the reliability and delay constraints of the system while
attaining closed-form approximations for the optimum wireless energy transfer
and wireless information transmission blocklength. Then, a more-elaborate rate
control strategy exploiting the readily available battery charge information is
proposed and the results evidence its outstanding performance when compared
with the fixed transmit rate, for which no battery charge information is
available. It even reaches an average rate performance close to that of an
ideal scheme requiring full Channel State Information at transmitter side.
Numerical results show the positive impact of a greater number of antennas at
the destination, and evidence that the greater the reliability constraints, the
smaller the message sizes on average, and the smaller the optimum information
blocklengths. Finally, we corroborate the appropriateness of using the
asymptotic blocklength formulation as an approximation of the non-asymptotic
finite blocklength results.

phenomenon, through which the quality of the built environment or artifacts can
be judged objectively. It bears two distinguished properties just like a tree:
""far more small things than large ones"" across all scales, and ""more or less
similar things"" on each scale. As a physical phenomenon, and mathematical
concept, living structure is essentially empirical, discovered and developed
from miniscule observation in nature- and human-made things, and it affects our
daily lives in some substantial ways, such as where to put a table or a flower
vase in a room, helping us to make beautiful things and environments. Living
structure is not only empirical, but also philosophical and visionary, enabling
us to see the world and space in more meaningful ways. This paper is intended
to defend living structure as a physical phenomenon, clarifying some common
questions and misgivings surrounding Alexander's design thoughts, such as the
objective or structural nature of beauty, building styles advocated by
Alexander, and mysterious nature of his concepts. We first illustrate living
structure - essentially organized complexity, as advocated by the late Jane
Jacobs (1916-2006) - that is governed by two fundamental laws (scaling law and
Tobler's law), and generated in some step by step fashion by two design
principles (differentiation and adaptation) through the 15 structural
properties. We then verify why living structure is primarily empirical, drawing
evidence from Alexander's own work, as well as our case studies applied to the
Earth's surface including cities, streets, and buildings, and two logos. Before
reaching conclusions, we concentrate on the most mysterious part of Alexander's
work - the hypothesized ""I"" - as a substance that pervasively exists
everywhere, in order to make better sense of living structure in our minds.

  Leibniz","15 pages, 9964 words",,,,"physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problematic relationship between science and philosophy has, since the
beginning of modernity, divided the world into two separate domains: nature and
human. Some of today's schools of philosophy and epistemological inquiry have
maintained a radical separation to the point where they refuse to maintain any
commonality within the two. We argue that such a dichotomy will not only
destroy the idea of the unity of knowledge from a theoretical perspective but,
it will destroy a unified understanding of reality. This article is a critique
of now mainstream belief of such dichotomy through re-reading of Leibniz's idea
on the unity of knowledge. The distinctive feature of Leibniz's approach, which
was specifically laid down in his correspondence with Clarke, is that his way
of reasoning is philosophical as well as physical. In Leibniz's view what
guarantees the soundness of philosophical principles cannot defy the laws of
physics. We shall also demonstrate that Chaos Theory is consistent with the
affinities of Leibniz's approach. The main focus of this article is on
re-evaluating views on causal determinism and randomness as well as free will.
The final claim of this article is that the natural world and human world
follow the same causal deterministic laws, and that causal laws are however
nonlinear. Knowledge of our reality should be rigorously sought in both the
domains of humanities and natural sciences, but this causal determinism should
distance itself from a simple linear causal model. What is thought of as random
events or probabilistic events in the physical world, as well as in the human
world, are not ontologically run by chance. The complexity and vastness of
reality are such that our knowledge of reality always suffers a lack, and it is
this lack of knowledge that is usually being called randomness.
