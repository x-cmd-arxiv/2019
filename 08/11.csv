segmentation and optical flow estimation into convex problems in a suitable
higher-dimensional space. The lifted models can then be efficiently solved to a
global optimum, which allows to find approximate global minimizers of the
original problem. Recently, these techniques have also been applied to problems
with values in a manifold. We provide a review of such methods in a refined

the concept of sublabel-accurate lifting to manifolds. We also generalize
existing methods for total variation regularization to support general convex

Further, twisted TMD heterobilayers can form moir\'e patterns that modulate the
electronic band structure according to atomic registry, leading to spatial
confinement of interlayer exciton (IXs). Here we report the observation of
spin-layer locking of IXs trapped in moir\'e potentials formed in a

the atomic registries of the moir\'e trapping sites in the three layers are
intrinsically locked together due to the 2H-type stacking characteristic of
bilayer TMDs. These results identify the layer index as a useful degree of
freedom to engineer tunable few-level quantum systems in two-dimensional

plane waves at a fixed frequency and measured on the circle $\partial B_R$ with
a sufficiently large radius $R$. The theoretical analysis of our method is
based on the asymptotic property in the operator norm from
$H^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1)$ to $H^{-1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1)$ of the phaseless
total-field operator defined in terms of the phaseless total-field data
measured on $\partial B_R$ with large enough $R$, where $H^s(\mathbb{S}^1)$ is
a Sobolev space on the unit circle $\mathbb{S}^1$ for real number $s$, together
with the factorization of a modified far-field operator. The asymptotic

paper with the theory of oscillatory integrals. The unknown scatterer can be
either an impenetrable obstacle of sound-soft, sound-hard or impedance type or
an inhomogeneous medium with a compact support, and the proposed inversion
algorithm does not need to know the boundary condition of the unknown obstacle
in advance. Numerical examples are also carried out to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our inversion method. To the best of our knowledge, it is the

self-excited attrators and hidden attractors, i.e., the equilibria of the
system are immersed in the basin of attraction of the seft-excited attractors,
so hidden attractors appear around these self-excited attractors. The approach
starts by generating a double-scroll attractor based on two equilibria
presented heteroclinic orbits. Then, two equilibria are added to the system, so
biestability is generated by displaying two self-excited attractor. In this
paper we show that hidden attractors arise as a consequence of the rupture of
trajectories that resemble heteroclinic orbits at a larger scale. Therefore,
multistability appears naturally as an interesting phenomenon present in this
class of dynamical systems via hidden attractors and self-excited attractors.
The study suggests the feasibility of the geometric design of new classes of
multistable systems with coexistence of the two classes of attractors or even
multistable systems without equilibria at all.

and perception, the parallel tasks of motion planning and state estimation
become more strongly coupled. This coupling is well-captured by augmenting the
planning objective with a posterior-covariance penalty -- however, prediction
of the estimator covariance is challenging when the observation model depends
on unknown landmarks, as is the case in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM). This paper addresses these challenges in the case of landmark- and
SLAM-based estimators, enabling efficient prediction (and ultimately
minimization) of this performance metric. First, we provide an interval-based
filtering approximation of the SLAM inference process which allows for
recursive propagation of the ego-covariance while avoiding the quadratic
complexity of explicitly tracking landmark uncertainty. Secondly, we introduce
a Lie-derivative measurement bundling scheme that simplifies the recursive
""bundled"" update, representing significant computational savings for high-rate
sensors such as cameras. Finally, we identify a large class of measurement
models (which includes orthographic camera projection) for which the
contributions from each landmark can be directly combined, making evaluation of
the information gained at each timestep (nearly) independent of the number of
landmarks. This also enables the generalization from finite sets of landmarks
$\{\ell^{(n)} \}$ to distributions, foregoing the need for fully-specified
linearization points at planning time and allowing for new landmarks to be
anticipated. Taken together, these contributions allow SLAM performance to be
accurately and efficiently predicted, paving the way for online,
observability-aware trajectory optimization in unknown space.

$V(r)= \frac{1}{g^2}\,\hat{V}(gr)$ the Perturbation Theory (PT) in powers of

of $g$ (strong coupling regime) is developed constructively in $r$-space and in
$(gr)$ space, respectively. The Riccati-Bloch (RB) equation and Generalized
Bloch (GB) equation are introduced as ones which govern dynamics in coordinate
$r$-space and in $(gr)$-space, respectively, exploring the logarithmic

in RB equation leads to Taylor expansion of $y$ at small $r$ while being
developed in GB equation leads to a new form of semiclassical expansion at
large $(g r)$: it coincides with loop expansion in path integral formalism. In
complementary way PT for large $g$ developed in RB equation leads to an
expansion of $y$ at large $r$ and developed in GB equation leads to an
expansion at small $(g r)$. Interpolating all four expansions for $y$ leads to
a compact function (called the {\it Approximant}), which should uniformly
approximate the exact eigenfunction at $r \in [0, \infty)$ for any coupling
constant $g \geq 0$ and dimension $D > 0$. Free parameters of the Approximant
are fixed by taking it as a trial function in variational calculus. As a
concrete application the low-lying states of the cubic anharmonic oscillator

Approximant from the exact ground state eigenfunction is $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for
$r \in [0, \infty)$ for coupling constant $g \geq 0$ and dimension
$D=1,2,\ldots$. In turn, the variational energies of the low-lying states are
obtained with unprecedented accuracy 7-8 s.d. for $g \geq 0$ and

aim to shed light on our understanding of global patterns that occur on
infinite strings. We utilise methods of geometric group theory. Our emphasis is
on large scale geometries. Two infinite strings have the same large scale
geometry if there are colour preserving bi-Lipschitz maps with distortions
between the strings. Call these maps quasi-isometries. Introduction of large
scale geometries poses several questions. The first question asks to study the
partial order induced by quasi-isometries. This partial order compares large
scale geometries; as such it presents an algebraic tool for classification of
global patterns. We prove there is a greatest large scale geometry and
infinitely many minimal large scale geometries. The second question is related
to understanding the quasi-isometric maps on various classes of strings. The
third question investigates the sets of large scale geometries of strings
accepted by computational models, e.g. B\""uchi automata. We provide an
algorithm that describes large scale geometries of strings accepted by B\""uchi
automata. This links large scale geometries with automata theory. The fourth
question studies the complexity of the quasi-isometry problem. We show the
problem is $\Sigma_3^0$-complete thus providing a bridge with computability
theory. Finally, the fifth question asks to build algebraic structures that are
invariants of large scale geometries. We invoke asymptotic cones, a key concept
in geometric group theory, defined via model-theoretic notion of ultra-product.
Partly, we study asymptotic cones of algorithmically random strings thus
connecting the topic with algorithmic randomness.

Higman: automorphisms via dynamics for the Higman groups $G_{n,r}$"" of Bleak,
Cameron, Maissel, Navas and Olukoya (BCMNO) characterises the automorphisms of
the Higman-Thompson groups $G_{n,r}$ as the specific subgroup of the rational
group $\mathcal{R}_{n,r}$ of Grigorchuk, Nekrashevych and Suchanski{\u i}'s
consisting of those elements which have the additional property of being
bi-synchronizing. In this article, we extend the arguments of BCMNO and
characterise the automorphism group of $T_{n,r}$ as a subgroup of
$\mathrm{Aut}{G_{n,r}}$. We then show that the groups $\mathrm{Out}{T_{n,r}}$
can be identified with subgroups of the group $\mathrm{Out}{T_{n,n-1}}$.
Extending results of Brin and Guzman, we show that the groups
$\mathrm{Out}{T_{n,r}}$, for $n>2$, are all infinite and contain an isomorphic
copy of Thompson's group $F$. For $X \in \{T,G\}$, we study the groups
$\mathrm{Out}{X_{n,r}}$ and show that these fit in a lattice structure where
$\mathrm{Out}{X_{n,1}} \unlhd \mathrm{Out}{X_{n,r}}$ for all $1 \le r \le n-1$
and $\mathrm{Out}{X_{n,r}} \unlhd \mathrm{Out}{X_{n,n-1}}$. This gives a
partial answer to a question in BCMNO concerning the normal subgroup structure
of $\mathrm{Out}{G_{n,n-1}}$. Furthermore, we deduce that for $1\le j,d \le
n-1$ such that $d = \gcd(j, n-1)$, $\mathrm{Out}{X_{n,j}} =
\mathrm{Out}{X_{n,d}}$ extending a result of BCMNO for the groups $G_{n,r}$ to
the groups $T_{n,r}$. We give a negative answer to the question in BCMNO which
asks whether or not $\mathrm{Out}{G_{n,r}} \cong \mathrm{Out}{G_{n,s}}$ if and
only if $\gcd(n-1,r) = \gcd(n-1,s)$. We conclude by showing that the groups
$T_{n,r}$ have the $R_{\infty}$ property extending the result of Burillo,
Matucci and Ventura and, independently, Gon{\c c}alves and Sankaran, for

dielectric enclosure in vicinity to the electrode assembly was studied. The
discharge operating in air without the dielectric was able to operate within a
very narrow voltage range of approximately 200 V. The pulsing frequency was
below 1.2 kHz and current peaks were below 14 mA. Increasing the applied
voltage onto the positive electrode beyond this range would result in sparks
between the electrodes. When the Teflon tube enclosure surrounding the high

expanded up to 3-5 kV. The pulsing frequency increased up to 12 kHz and the
current peak level increased to approximately 35 mA. Increasing voltage beyond
the point with peak pulsing frequency would result in a drop of pulsing

prove exponential decay of the shape functions which allows for a sparse

derived for the proposed method together with numerical examples that verify
the theoretical findings. Finally we present a numerical example to show how

based on the measured data are calculated. The distributions of frequency in
different power grids fall into two categories, e.g., single-peak distribution
and multi-peak distribution. Furthermore, a meaningful insight that the
single-peak distributions of the frequency almost follow the normal

worldwide main power grids using FNET/GridEye could help the power system

inventory and make purchase decisions is a critical problem in eCommerce
search. Typically, items are independently predicted with a probability of sale
with respect to a given search query. But in a dynamic marketplace like eBay,
even for a single product, there are various different factors distinguishing
one item from another which can influence the purchase decision for the user.
Users have to make a purchase decision by considering all of these options.
Majority of the existing learning to rank algorithms model the relative
relevance between labeled items only at the loss functions like pairwise or
list-wise losses. But they are limited to point-wise scoring functions where
items are ranked independently based on the features of the item itself. In
this paper, we study the influence of an item's neighborhood to its purchase
decision. Here, we consider the neighborhood as the items ranked above and
below the current item in search results. By adding delta features comparing
items within a neighborhood and learning a ranking model, we are able to
experimentally show that the new ranker with delta features outperforms our
baseline ranker in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The ranking models with
proposed delta features result in $3-5\%$ improvement in MRR over the baseline
model. We also study impact of different sizes for neighborhood. Experimental
results show that neighborhood size $3$ perform the best based on MRR with an
improvement of $4-5\%$ over the baseline model.

probability that it takes over the population given some initial
mutant-appearance distribution. This ""fixation probability"" is difficult to
compute in general, as it depends on the mutation's effect on the organism as
well as the population's spatial structure, mating patterns, and other factors.
In this study, we consider weak selection, which means that the mutation's
effect on the organism is small. We obtain a weak-selection perturbation
expansion of a mutant's fixation probability, from an arbitrary initial
configuration of mutant and resident types. Our results apply to a broad class
of stochastic evolutionary models, in which the size and spatial structure are
arbitrary (but fixed). The problem of whether selection favors a given trait is
thereby reduced from exponential to polynomial complexity in the population
size, when selection is weak. We conclude by applying these methods to obtain
new results for evolutionary dynamics on graphs.

energy levels of heavy nuclei to zeros of $L$-functions. Many statistics in one
can be interpreted in terms of quantities of the other; for example, zeros of
$L$-functions correspond to eigenvalues of matrices, and values of
$L$-functions to values of the characteristic polynomials. This correspondence
has allowed RMT to successfully predict many number theory behaviors; however,
there are some operations which to date have no RMT analogue. The motivation of
this paper is to try and find an RMT equivalent to Rankin-Selberg convolution,
which builds a new $L$-functions from an input pair.
  For definiteness we concentrate on two specific families, the ensemble of
palindromic real symmetric Toeplitz (PST) matrices and the ensemble of real
symmetric (RS) matrices, whose limiting spectral measures are the Gaussian and
semicircle distributions, respectively; these were chosen as they are the two
extreme cases in terms of moment calculations. For a PST matrix $A$ and a RS
matrix $B$, we construct an ensemble of random real symmetric block matrices
whose first row is $\lbrace A, B \rbrace$ and whose second row is $\lbrace B, A
\rbrace$. By Markov's Method of Moments, we show this ensemble converges weakly

a wide range of scientific applications. Many existing network inference
solutions focus on global testing of entire networks, without comparing
individual network links. Besides, the observed data often take the form of
vectors or matrices, and the problem is formulated as comparing two covariance
or precision matrices under a normal or matrix normal distribution. Moreover,
many tests suffer from a limited power under a small sample size. In this
article, we tackle the problem of network comparison, both global and
simultaneous inferences, when the data come in a different format, i.e., in the
form of a collection of symmetric matrices, each of which encodes the network
structure of an individual subject. Such data format commonly arises in
applications such as brain connectivity analysis and clinical genomics. We no
longer require the underlying data to follow a normal distribution, but instead
impose some moment conditions that are easily satisfied for numerous types of
network data. Furthermore, we propose a power enhancement procedure, and show
that it can control the false discovery, while it has the potential to
substantially enhance the power of the test. We investigate the efficacy of our
testing procedure through both an asymptotic analysis and a simulation study
under a finite sample size. We further illustrate our method with an example of
brain structural connectivity analysis.

different modalities, i.e., cross-modal anomalies. Some of the data instances
within a multi-modal context are often not anomalous when they are viewed
separately in each individual modality, but contains inconsistent patterns when
multiple sources are jointly considered. The existence of multi-modal data in

which need a large set of labeled images to achieve promising performance.
However, in most cases, labeled data are expensive or even impossible to
obtain, while unlabeled data are readily available from numerous free on-line
resources and have been exploited to improve the performance of deep neural
networks. To better exploit the power of unlabeled data for image recognition,
in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised and generative approach, namely the
semi-supervised self-growing generative adversarial network (SGGAN). Label
inference is a key step for the success of semi-supervised learning approaches.
There are two main problems in label inference: how to measure the confidence
of the unlabeled data and how to generalize the classifier. We address these
two problems via the generative framework and a novel
convolution-block-transformation technique, respectively. To stabilize and
speed up the training process of SGGAN, we employ the metric Maximum Mean

than the standard semi-supervised GANs (SSGANs), narrowing the gap to the
supervised methods. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show the
effectiveness of the proposed SGGAN on image recognition and facial attribute

  Condition On Nonlocal Problems",,,,,"math.AP cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider 2D nonlocal diffusion models with a finite nonlocal
horizon parameter $\delta$ characterizing the range of nonlocal interactions,
and consider the treatment of Neumann-like boundary conditions that have proven
challenging for discretizations of nonlocal models. While existing 2D nonlocal
flux boundary conditions have been shown to exhibit at most first order
convergence to the local counter part as $\delta\rightarrow 0$, we present a
new generalization of classical local Neumann conditions that recovers the
local case as $O(\delta^2)$ in the $L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ norm. This convergence
rate is optimal considering the $O(\delta^2)$ convergence of the nonlocal
equation to its local limit away from the boundary. We analyze the application
of this new boundary treatment to the nonlocal diffusion problem, and present
conditions under which the solution of the nonlocal boundary value problem
converges to the solution of the corresponding local Neumann problem as the
horizon is reduced. To demonstrate the applicability of this nonlocal flux
boundary condition to more complicated scenarios, we extend the approach to
less regular domains, numerically verifying that we preserve second-order
convergence for domains with corners. Based on the new formulation for nonlocal
boundary condition, we develop an asymptotically compatible meshfree
discretization, obtaining a solution to the nonlocal diffusion equation with
mixed boundary conditions that converges with $O(\delta^2)$ convergence.

both the isotropy and homogeneity of galaxy distribution. While the former
aspect is particularly highlighted as a probe of growth of structure induced by
gravity, the latter aspect, often quoted as wide-angle RSD but ignored in most
of the cases, will become important and critical to account for as increasing
the statistical precision in next-generation surveys. However, the impact of
wide-angle RSD has been mostly studied using linear perturbation theory. In
this paper, employing the Zel'dovich approximation, i.e., first-order
Lagrangian perturbation theory for gravitational evolution of matter
fluctuations, we present a quasi-linear treatment of wide-angle RSD, and
compute the cross-correlation function. The present formalism consistently
reproduces linear theory results, and can be easily extended to incorporate
relativistic corrections (e.g., gravitational redshift).

becoming increasingly useful. Despite the great success of the generic object
detection methods trained on ground-to-ground images, a huge performance drop
is observed when they are directly applied to images captured by UAVs. The
unsatisfactory performance is owing to many UAV-specific nuisances, such as
varying flying altitudes, adverse weather conditions, dynamically changing
viewing angles, etc. Those nuisances constitute a large number of fine-grained
domains, across which the detection model has to stay robust. Fortunately, UAVs
will record meta-data that depict those varying attributes, which are either
freely available along with the UAV images, or can be easily obtained. We
propose to utilize those free meta-data in conjunction with associated UAV
images to learn domain-robust features via an adversarial training framework
dubbed Nuisance Disentangled Feature Transform (NDFT), for the specific
challenging problem of object detection in UAV images, achieving a substantial
gain in robustness to those nuisances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm, by showing state-of-the-art performance (single model) on
two existing UAV-based object detection benchmarks. The code is available at

strengthened Generative Adversarial Network, termed ESSGAN, for reconstructing

introduce strengthened connections (SCs) to improve the utilization of the
feature maps between the proposed strengthened convolutional autoencoders

In addition, we creatively introduce a residual in residual block (RIRB) to SG.
RIRB increases the depth of SG, thus enhances feature expression ability of SG.
Moreover, it can give the encoder blocks and the decoder blocks richer texture
features. To further reduce artifacts and preserve more image details, we
introduce an enhanced structural loss to SG. ESSGAN can provide higher image
quality with less model parameters than the state-of-the-art deep
learning-based methods at different undersampling rates of different

quantum orbits carrying different initial phases. This method could in

charge injection and high electrical Rayleigh number, the system exhibits
electro-convective vortices. Disturbed by different perturbation patterns, such

numerical solutions. The interactions between the applied Couette and
Poiseuille cross-flows and electroconvective vortices lead to the flow patterns
change. When the cross-flow velocity is greater than a threshold value, the
spanwise structures are suppressed; however, the cross-flow does not affect the
streamwise patterns. The dynamics of the transition is analyzed by DMD.

insulator in the presence of magnetic proximity effects and warped surface
states. It is found that a magnetic field can shift the Dirac cone in momentum
space and deform the constant-energy contour, or opens up a band gap at the
Dirac point, depending on the magnetization orientation. The double gate
voltage induces quantum wells and/or quantum barriers on the surface of
topological insulators, generating surface resonant tunnelling states. It is
found that the hexagonal warping effect can increase the electronic transport
at high energies when the constant-energy contour exhibits a snowflake shape.
The energy-dependent conductances in the parallel and antiparallel magnetic
configurations exhibit out-of-phase oscillations due to the quantum
interference of propagating waves in the region between the two magnetized
segments. Although the conductance spectrum of the double-well structure is
higher than that of the double-barrier structure, the magnetoresistance ratio
versus the separation distance between the two magnetized barriers exhibits
pronounced oscillations due to the resonant tunnelling states. We show that the
surface state transport can be controlled by the exchange field and gate
voltage without breaking time reversal symmetry, suggesting that the double
gated and magnetized topological insulators can be utilized to achieve a large
magnetoresistance ratio with a tunable sign.

networks, which one can use to encode time-dependent interactions, multiple

Like their monolayer counterparts, multilayer networks in applications often
have mesoscale features, such as community structure. A prominent type of
method for inferring such structures is the employment of multilayer stochastic
block models (SBMs). A common (but {potentially} inadequate) assumption of
these models is the sampling of edges in different layers independently,
conditioned on the community labels of the nodes. In this paper, we relax this
assumption of independence by incorporating edge correlations into an SBM-like
model. We derive maximum-likelihood estimates of the key parameters of our
model, and we propose a measure of layer correlation that reflects the
similarity between connectivity patterns in different layers. Finally, we
explain how to use correlated models for edge ""prediction"" (i.e., inference) in
multilayer networks. By taking into account edge correlations, prediction
accuracy improves both in synthetic networks and in a temporal network of
shoppers who are connected to previously-purchased grocery products.

approaches for optimal control problems governed by an important class of
Nonlinear Coupled Anisotropic Convection-Diffusion Chemotaxis-type System
(NCACDCS). This study is motivated by the fact that the considered complex
systems (with complex geometries) appear in diverse biochemical, biological and
biosocial criminology problems. To solve numerically the corresponding
nonlinear optimization problems, the primal problem NCACDCS is discretised by a
coupled Lattice Boltzmann Method with a general Multiple-Relaxation-Time
collision operators (MRT) while for the adjoint problem, an Adjoint
Multiple-Relaxation-Time lattice Boltzmann model (AMRT) is proposed and
investigated.
  First, the optimal control problems are formulated and first-order necessary
optimality conditions are established by using sensitivity and adjoint
calculus. The resulting problems are discretised by the coupled MRT and AMRT
models and solved via gradient descent methods. First of all, an efficient and
stable modified MRT model for NCACDCS is developed, and through the
Chapman-Enskog analysis we show that NCACDCS can be correctly recovered from
the proposed MRT model. For the adjoint problem, the discretisation strategy is
based on AMRT model, which is found to be as simple as MRT model with also
highly-efficient parallel nature. The derivation of AMRT model and the discrete
cost functional gradient are derived mathematically in detail using the
developed MRT model. The obtained method is reliable, efficient, practical to
implement and can be easily incorporated into any existing MRT code.

understanding of the mechanism that brain processes information. Among the
classical theories of neural coding, the population rate coding has been
studied widely in many works. Most computational studies considered the neurons
and the corresponding presynaptic synapses as pre-determined excitatory or
inhibitory types. According to physiological evidence, however, that the real
effect of a synapse is inhibitory or excitatory is determined by the type of
the activated receptors. The co-release of excitatory and inhibitory receptors
in the same synapse exists widely in the brain. In this paper, we study the
population rate coding in recurrent neuronal networks with undetermined neurons
and synapses, different from the traditional works, in which one neuron can
perform either excitatory or inhibitory effect to the corresponding
postsynaptic neurons. We find such neuronal networks can encode the stimuli
information in population firing rate well. We find that intermediate recurrent
probability together with moderate Inhibitory-Excitatory strength ratio can
enhance the encoding performance. Suitable combinations of the previous two
parameters with the noise intensity, the excitatory synaptic strength and the
synaptic time constant have promoting effects on the performance of population
rate coding. Finally, we compare the performance of population rate coding
between the traditional (determined) model and ours, and we find that it is
rational to consider the co-release of inhibitory and excitatory receptors.

bottleneck representation while maintaining similar complexity via jointly
encoding the feature interdependencies across both spatial and channel
dimensions. It has two reciprocal components, namely spatial
contraction-expansion and channel expansion-contraction, nested in a
bilaterally symmetric structure. The combination of two interdependent

domains. The transport features of magnetic WSMs, including negative
magnetoresistivity and anomalous Hall conductivity, are not conclusive since
these are sensitive to extrinsic factors like defects and disorders in lattice
or magnetic ordering. Here, we systematically study the temperature-dependent
optical spectra of ferromagnetic Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ experimentally and simulated
by first-principles calculations. The many-body correlation effect due to Co
$3d$ electrons leads to the renormalization of bands by a factor about 1.33,
which is moderate and the description within density functional theory is
suitable. As the temperature drops down, the magnetic phase transition happens
and the magnetization drives the band shift through exchange splitting. The
optical spectra can well detect these changes, including the transitions
sensitive and insensitive to the magnetization, and those from the bands around
the Weyl nodes. The results strongly support that Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ is a
magnetic WSM and the Weyl nodes can be tuned by magnetization with temperature
change.

unclonable analog physical identities which are relatively complex and suffer

bitstream-manipulator serves as ""mutation generator"" to randomly-manipulate the
bitstream without violating the FPGA design rules. Two large cipher classes

structure for a non-volatile FPGA fabric structure. The cipher-mutation process
is just a simple random unknown-cipher-selection by consulting the FPGA's
internal True Random Number Generator (TRNG). The security levels and qualities
of the proposed ciphers are evaluated. The attained security levels are

the band gap of Sn2BiH2 monolayer has experienced a growth of 80% compared with

gap can be properly manipulated by biaxial strain (-13% to +21%) within a range
from 0.2 to 1.6 eV. It should be mentioned that the stability and flexibility
of the corresponding monolayer under tensile and compressive strain are due to
the strong {\sigma} bonds between atoms. We also realized the strain can cause
indirect-direct transition in the band gap. Furthermore, our optical findings
indicate that the Sn2BiH2 monolayer has almost metallic properties in a

the DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) forces and the non-DLVO molecular

force leads to upto four orders of magnitude and upto three orders of magnitude

imaging technique, Magnetoencephalography (MEG), which measures the magnetic
fields outside the human head produced by the electrical activity inside the

current with a time-varying structure and solve the MEG inverse problem by
mainly estimating the source moment parameters. These methods use the fact that
the magnetic fields linearly depend on the moment parameters of the source, and
work well under the linear dynamic system. However, magnetic fields are known
to be non-linearly related to the location parameters of the source. The
existing work on estimating the time-varying unknown location parameters is
limited. We are motivated to investigate the source distribution for the
location parameters based on a dynamic framework, where the posterior
distribution of the source is computed in a closed form discretely. The new
framework allows us not only to directly approximate the posterior distribution
of the source current, where sequential sampling methods may suffer from slow
convergence due to the large volume of measurement, but also to quantify the
source distribution at any time point from the entire set of measurements
reflecting the distribution of the source, rather than using only the
measurements up to the time point of interest. Both a dynamic procedure and a
switch procedure are proposed for the new discrete approach, balancing
estimation accuracy and computational efficiency when multiple sources are
present. In both simulation and real data, we illustrate that the new method is
able to provide comprehensive insight into the time evolution of the sources at
different stages of the MEG and EEG experiment.

with an onset of ferromagnetism below 650 K, and undergoes a spin reorientation

the kagome plane at high temperatures and parallel to the kagome plane at low
temperatures, how the distribution of the magnetic domains in the two different
spin orientations evolve throughout the spin reorientation is not well known.
Furthermore, while there have been various reports on the magnetotransport
properties in the Hall configuration, the angular dependence of
magnetoresistance has not been studied so far. In this paper, we have examined
the spin reorientation by using anisotropic magnetoresistivity in detail,
exploiting the dependence of the resistivity on the direction between
magnetization and applied current. We are able to determine the distribution of
the magnetic domains as a function of temperature between 360 K to 2 K and the
reorientation transition to peak at 120 K. We discover that both out of plane
and in plane phases coexist at temperatures around the spin reorientation,
indicative of a first order transition. Although the volume of the magnetic
domains in the different phases sharply changes at the spin reorientation
transition, the electronic structure for a specific magnetization is not
influenced by the spin reorientation. In contrast, we observe an electronic
transition around 40 K, hitherto unreported, and reflected in both the
zero-field resistivity and anisotropic resistivity.

CMB maps and efficiently generate new sets of CMB data in the form of 2D
patches of anisotropy maps without losing much accuracy. We limit our
experiment to the generation of 56$^{\circ}$ and 112$^{\circ}$ square patches
of CMB maps. We have also trained a Multilayer perceptron model for estimation
of baryon density from a CMB map, we will be using this model for the
performance evaluation of our generative model using diagnostic measures like
Histogram of pixel intensities, the standard deviation of pixel intensity
distribution, Power Spectrum, Cross power spectrum, Correlation matrix of the
power spectrum and Peak count. We show that the GAN model is able to
efficiently generate CMB samples of multiple sizes and is sensitive to the
cosmological parameters corresponding to the underlying distribution of the
data. The primiary advantage of this method is the exponential reduction in the
computational time needed to generate the CMB data, the GAN model is able to
generate the samples within seconds as opposed to hours required by the CAMB
package with an acceptable value to error and loss of information. We hope that
future iterations of this methodology will replace traditional statistical

  Neural Survival Model for Early Prediction of Sepsis",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sepsis, a dysregulated immune system response to infection, is among the
leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost overruns in the Intensive Care
Unit (ICU). Early prediction of sepsis can improve situational awareness
amongst clinicians and facilitate timely, protective interventions. While the
application of predictive analytics in ICU patients has shown early promising
results, much of the work has been encumbered by high false-alarm rates.
Efforts to improve specificity have been limited by several factors, most
notably the difficulty of labeling sepsis onset time and the low prevalence of
septic-events in the ICU. Here, we present DeepAISE (Deep Artificial
Intelligence Sepsis Expert), a recurrent neural survival model for the early
prediction of sepsis. We show that by coupling a clinical criterion for
defining sepsis onset time with a treatment policy (e.g., initiation of
antibiotics within one hour of meeting the criterion), one may rank the
relative utility of various criteria through offline policy evaluation. Given
the optimal criterion, DeepAISE automatically learns predictive features
related to higher-order interactions and temporal patterns among clinical risk
factors that maximize the data likelihood of observed time to septic events.
DeepAISE has been incorporated into a clinical workflow, which provides
real-time hourly sepsis risk scores. A comparative study of four baseline
models indicates that DeepAISE produces the most accurate predictions (AUC=0.90
and 0.87) and the lowest false alarm rates (FAR=0.20 and 0.26) in two separate
cohorts (internal and external, respectively), while simultaneously producing
interpretable representations of the clinical time series and risk factors.

both HCI and the broader community of those interested in technology design,
development and policy. In this paper, we explore the application of one
prominent ethical framework - Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency - to a
proposed algorithm that resolves various societal issues around food security
and population ageing. Using various standardised forms of algorithmic audit
and evaluation, we drastically increase the algorithm's adherence to the FAT
framework, resulting in a more ethical and beneficent system. We discuss how
this might serve as a guide to other researchers or practitioners looking to
ensure better ethical outcomes from algorithmic systems in their line of work.

Despite this increased engagement, HCI continues to lack an explicitly

oppression. In this paper, we set out an explicit political vision of an HCI
grounded in emancipatory autonomy - an anarchist HCI, aimed at dismantling all
oppressive systems by mandating suspicion of and a reckoning with imbalanced
distributions of power. We outline some of the principles and accountability
mechanisms that constitute an anarchist HCI. We offer a potential framework for
radically reorienting the field towards creating prefigurative counterpower -
systems and spaces that exemplify the world we wish to see, as we go about
building the revolution in increment.

several cross-domain collaborative filtering strategies have been recently
introduced to transfer the knowledge of user preferences across domains. The
main challenge of cross-domain recommendation is to weigh and learn users'
different behaviors in multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a
Cross-Domain collaborative filtering model following a Translation-based
strategy, namely CDT. In our model, we learn the embedding space with
translation vectors and capture high-order feature interactions in users'
multiple preferences across domains. In doing so, we efficiently compute the
transitivity between feature latent embeddings, that is if feature pairs have
high interaction weights in the latent space, then feature embeddings with no
observed interactions across the domains will be closely related as well. We
formulate our objective function as a ranking problem in factorization machines
and learn the model's parameters via gradient descent. In addition, to better
capture the non-linearity in user preferences across domains we extend the
proposed CDT model by using a deep learning strategy, namely DeepCDT. Our
experiments on six publicly available cross-domain tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed models, outperforming other state-of-the-art
cross-domain strategies.

implement various intelligent transportation-related applications. Both
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications
will be needed to reliably disseminate information in a vehicular network. In
this regard, a roadside unit (RSU) equipped with multiple antennas can improve
the network capacity. While the traditional approaches assume antennas to
experience independent fading, we consider a more practical uplink scenario
where antennas at the RSU experience correlated fading. In particular, we
evaluate the packet error probability for two renowned antenna correlation
models, i.e., constant correlation (CC) and exponential correlation (EC). We
also consider intermediate cooperative vehicles for reliable communication
between the source vehicle and the RSU. Here, we derive closed-form expressions
for packet error probability which help quantify the performance variations due
to fading parameter, correlation coefficients and the number of intermediate
helper vehicles. To evaluate the optimal transmit power in this network
scenario, we formulate a Stackelberg game, wherein, the source vehicle is
treated as a buyer and the helper vehicles are the sellers. The optimal
solutions for the asking price and the transmit power are devised which
maximize the utility functions of helper vehicles and the source vehicle,
respectively. We verify our mathematical derivations by extensive simulations
in MATLAB.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Micro-energy harvesting wireless network (MEHWN) enables a perpetual network
deployment that cannot be achieved in traditional battery-operated
counterparts. Despite its sustainability, end-to-end delay in an MEHWN could be
very large, due to the large waiting delay on each hop in the network. In this
work, we consider an MEHWN where every node constantly switches between on and
off states, due to the limited amount of harvested energy. The network delay of
an MEHWN is not well understood because of the energy uncertainty,
asynchronized working schedules, and complex network topology in an MEHWN. To
close this research gap, we define the relative network delay as the ratio
between end-to-end delay and distance. Compared to previous works, we are able
to identify a closed-form expression of the lower bound and a tighter upper
bound of the relative network delay. The theoretical findings are verified in
simulations. Our theoretical analysis deepens the understanding about the
interplay of network delay, energy harvesting rate, and node density in an
MEHWN.

perform denoising of the data before classification. In this paper, we
consolidate the approach by training an all-in-one model that is able to
classify even noisy characters. For classification, we progressively train a
classifier generative adversarial network on the characters from low to high
resolution. We show that by learning the features at each resolution
independently a trained model is able to accurately classify characters even in
the presence of noise. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach by classifying noisy versions of MNIST, handwritten Bangla Numeral,

boundary details considerably better than other upsampling operators such as

index-guided encoder-decoder framework where indices are self-learned
adaptively from data and are used to guide the downsampling and upsampling
stages, without extra training supervision. At the core of this framework is a
new learnable module, termed Index Network (IndexNet), which dynamically
generates indices conditioned on the feature map itself. IndexNet can be used
as a plug-in applying to almost all off-the-shelf convolutional networks that
have coupled downsampling and upsampling stages, giving the networks the
ability to dynamically capture variations of local patterns. In particular, we
instantiate and investigate five families of IndexNet and demonstrate their
effectiveness on four dense prediction tasks, including image denoising, image
