protections and minimum costs. The target system is modeled as a discrete-event
system (DES) in which a few states are secrets, and there are multiple subsets
of protectable events with different cost levels. We formulate the problem as
to ensure that every string that reaches a secret state (from the initial
state) contains a specified number of protectable events and the highest cost
level of these events is minimum. We first provide a necessary and sufficient
condition under which this security problem is solvable, and then propose an
algorithm to solve the problem based on the supervisory control theory of DES.
The resulting solution is a protection policy which specifies at each state
which events to protect and the highest cost level of protecting these events
is minimum. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution with a
network security example.

We propose Asymmetric Convolution Block (ACB), an architecture-neutral

strengthen the square convolution kernels. For an off-the-shelf architecture,
we replace the standard square-kernel convolutional layers with ACBs to
construct an Asymmetric Convolutional Network (ACNet), which can be trained to
reach a higher level of accuracy. After training, we equivalently convert the
ACNet into the same original architecture, thus requiring no extra computations
anymore. We have observed that ACNet can improve the performance of various
models on CIFAR and ImageNet by a clear margin. Through further experiments, we
attribute the effectiveness of ACB to its capability of enhancing the model's
robustness to rotational distortions and strengthening the central skeleton
parts of square convolution kernels.

phases is crucial for fabricating new advanced solid materials, such as
glasses, quasicrystals and high-entropy alloys. Here we address this issue for
quasicrystal-forming Al-Cu-Fe alloys which can serve as a model for studying
microscopic mechanisms of quasicrystal formation. We study experimentally two
structural-sensitive properties of the liquid -- viscosity and undercoolability
-- and compare results with \textit{ab initio} investigations of short-range
order (SRO). We observe that SRO in Al-Cu-Fe melts is polytetrahedral and
mainly presented by distorted Kasper polyhedra. However, topologically perfect
icosahedra are almost absent an even stoichiometry of icosahedral quasicrystal
phase that suggests the topological structure of local polyhedra does not
survive upon melting. It is shown that the main features of interatomic
interaction in Al-Cu-Fe system, extracted from radial distribution function and
bong-angle distribution function, are the same for both liquid and solid
states. In particular, the system demonstrates pronounced repulsion between Fe
and Cu as well as strong chemical interaction between Fe and Al, which are
almost concentration-independent. We argue that SRO and structural-sensitive
properties of a melt may serve as useful indicators of solid phase formation.
In particular, in the concentration region corresponding to the composition of
the icosahedral phase, a change in the chemical short-range order is observed,
which leads to minima on the viscosity and udercoolability isotherms and has a
noticeable effect on the initial stage of solidification.

causal order among them. The next question is then whether or not the causal

we will propose an efficient method to identify the set of all possible causal

through which electrons preferentially move, highlighting NPG's potential for

of the bridges resulting in destructive quantum interference, which blocks the

The framework combines probabilistic movement primitives with descriptions of

arrangements. For an arrangement, $\mathcal A$, of hyperplanes in $\mathbb
P^n$, $\mathcal A$ is free if $R/J$ is Cohen-Macaulay, where $J$ is the
Jacobian ideal of $\mathcal A$. Terao's conjecture says that freeness of
$\mathcal A$ is determined by the combinatorics of the intersection lattice of
$\mathcal A$. We study the Cohen-Macaulayness of three other ideals, all
unmixed, that are closely related to $\mathcal A$. Let $\overline J = \mathfrak
q_1 \cap \dots \cap \mathfrak q_s$ be the intersection of height two primary
components of $J$ and $\sqrt{J} = \mathfrak p_1 \cap \dots \cap \mathfrak p_s$
be the radical of $J$. Our third ideal is $\mathfrak p_1^{b_1} \cap \dots \cap
\mathfrak p_s^{b_s}$ for suitable $b_1,\dots, b_s$. With a mild hypothesis we
use liaison addition to show that all of these ideals are Cohen-Macaulay. When
our hypothesis does not hold, we show that these ideals are not necessarily
Cohen-Macaulay, and that Cohen-Macaulayness of any of these ideals does not
imply Cohen-Macaulayness of any of the others. While we do not study the
freeness of $\mathcal A$, we show by example that the Betti diagrams can vary
even for arrangements with the same combinatorics.
  We then study the situation when the hypothesis does not hold. For
equidimensional curves in $\mathbb P^3$, the Hartshorne-Rao module from liaison
theory measures the failure of an ideal to be Cohen-Macaulay, degree by degree,
and also determines the even liaison class of such a curve. We show that for
any positive integer $r$ there is an arrangement $\mathcal A$ for which
$R/\overline J$ fails to be Cohen-Macaulay in only one degree, and this failure
is by $r$; we also give an analogous result for $\sqrt{J}$. We draw
consequences for the corresponding even liaison class of the curve defined by
$\overline J$ or by $\sqrt{J}$.

typically used for solving optimization and sampling tasks, and in both
academia and industry the characterization of their usefulness is subject to
active research. Any problem that can naturally be described as a weighted,
undirected graph may be a particularly interesting candidate, since such a
problem may be formulated a as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
(QUBO) instance, which is solvable on D-Wave's Chimera graph architecture. In
this paper, we introduce a quantum-assisted finite-element method for design
optimization. We show that we can minimize a shape-specific quantity, in our
case a ray approximation of sound pressure at a specific position around an
object, by manipulating the shape of this object. Our algorithm belongs to the
class of quantum-assisted algorithms, as the optimization task runs iteratively
on a D-Wave 2000Q quantum processing unit (QPU), whereby the evaluation and
interpretation of the results happens classically. Our first and foremost aim
is to explain how to represent and solve parts of these problems with the help
of a QPU, and not to prove supremacy over existing classical finite-element
algorithms for design optimization.

with a large number of applications. However, classical clustering algorithms
assume that the data is static, thus failing to capture many real-world
applications where data is constantly changing and evolving. Driven by this, we
study the metric $k$-center clustering problem in the fully dynamic setting,
where the goal is to efficiently maintain a clustering while supporting an
intermixed sequence of insertions and deletions of points. This model also
supports queries of the form (1) report whether a given point is a center or
(2) determine the cluster a point is assigned to.
  We present a deterministic dynamic algorithm for the $k$-center clustering
problem that provably achieves a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in
poly-logarithmic update and query time, if the underlying metric has bounded
doubling dimension, its aspect ratio is bounded by a polynomial and $\epsilon$
is a constant. An important feature of our algorithm is that the update and
query times are independent of $k$. We confirm the practical relevance of this
feature via an extensive experimental study which shows that for values of $k$
and $\epsilon$ suggested by theory, our algorithmic construction outperforms
the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of solution quality and running time.

centered on the pivotal role played by John von Neumann's model. This
introduction is accessible to students and researchers from outside the field
of foundations of quantum mechanics and presented within a historical context.
We first explain the origins and the meaning of the measurement problem in
quantum theory, and why it is not present in classical physics. We perform a
chronological review of the quantization of action and explain how this led to
successive restrictions on what could be measured in atomic phenomena, until
the consolidation of the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics. The
clear separation between quantum system and classical apparatus that causes
these restrictions is subverted in von Neumann's paradigmatic model of quantum
measurements, a subject whose concepts we explain, while also providing the
mathematical tools necessary to apply it to new problems. We show how this
model was important in discussing the interpretations of quantum mechanics and
how it is still relevant in modern applications. In particular, we explain in
detail how it can be used to describe weak measurements and the surprising
results they entail. We also discuss the limitations of von Neumann's model of
measurements, and explain how they can be overcome with POVMs and Kraus
operators. We provide the mathematical tools necessary to work with these
generalized measurements and to derive master equations from them. Finally, we
demonstrate how these can be applied in research problems by calculating the
Quantum Zeno Effect.

time-distance inversion scheme. Our inversion pipeline allows inversion for all
quantities at once while allowing minimisation of the crosstalk between them.
This gives us an opportunity to discuss the possible biases present in the JSOC
data products. For the tests we used the subtractive optimally localised
averaging (SOLA) method with a minimisation of the cross-talk. We compared
three test inversions for each quantity at each target depth. At first, we used
the JSOC setup to reproduce the JSOC results. Subsequently, we used the
extended pipeline to improve these results by incorporating more independent
travel-time measurements but keeping the JSOC-indicated localisation in the
Sun. Finally, we inverted for flow components and sound-speed perturbations
using a localisation kernel with properties advertised in the JSOC metadata. We
successfully reproduced the horizontal flow components. The sound-speed
perturbations are strongly affected by the high level of the cross-talk in JSOC
products. This leads to larger amplitudes in the inversions for the sound-speed
perturbations. Different results were obtained when a target function localised
around the target depth was used. This is a consequence of non-localised JSOC
averaging kernels. We add that our methodology also allows inversion for the
vertical flow.

evolution of simulated MCs to investigate: What physical process dominates the
driving of turbulent flows? How can these flows be characterised? Do the
simulated flows agree with observations? Methods. We analyse three MCs that
have formed self-consistently within kpc-scale numerical simulations of the
ISM. The simulated ISM evolves under the influence of physical processes
including self-gravity, stratification, magnetic fields, supernova-driven
turbulence, and radiative heating and cooling. We characterise the flows using
VSFs with/out density weighting or a density cutoff, and computed in one or
three dimensions. Results. In regions with sufficient resolution, the
density-weighted VSFs initially appear to follow the expectations for uniform
turbulence consistent with Larson's size-velocity relationship. SN blast wave
impacts produce short-lived coherent motions at large scales, increasing the
scaling exponents for a crossing time. Gravitational contraction drives
small-scale motions, producing scaling coefficients that drop or even turn
negative as small scales become dominant. Conclusions. We conclude that two
different effects coincidentally reproduce Larson's size velocity relationship.
Initially, uniform turbulence dominates, so the energy cascade produces VSFs
consistent with Larson's relationship. Later, contraction dominates, the
density-weighted VSFs become much shallower or even inverted, but the
relationship of the global average velocity dispersion of the MCs to their
radius follows Larson's relationship, reflecting virial equilibrium or
free-fall collapse. The injection of energy by shocks is visible in the VSFs,
but decays within a crossing time.

potential energy and specific heat capacity (C_p) caloric curves as well as
structure analysis by radial distribution function (G(r)) and common neighbor
analysis (CNA) were utilized simultaneously to provide a comprehensive picture

surface energy (gamma_p) proposed here are holding several advantages over
previous criteria. In particular, potential energy distribution can distinguish
between interior and surface atoms and even corner, edge and plane atoms at the
surface. While G(r) and CNA are not surface sensitive methods and cannot
distinguish between surface melting and an allotropic transition. It is also
shown that allotropic change appears more clearly in C_p and gamma_p rather
than potential energy. However, determining accurate C_p requires enough
sampling to be averaged. Finally, a few issues in the current methods for
determining gamma_p were discussed and a simple method based on available
models was proposed which, independent of estimation of the surface area,
predicts the correct temperature and size-dependent trend in agreement with

the detection of fake news. Thereupon, we model each post as a network of

(PLCs) in industrial systems moves from two-wire field buses to IP-based
protocols such as Modbus/TCP. This increases the attack surface because the
IP-based network is often reachable from everywhere within the company. Thus,
centralized defenses, e.g. at the perimeter of the network do not offer
sufficient protection. Rather, decentralized defenses, where each part of the
network protects itself, are needed. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)
monitor the network and report suspicious activity. They usually run on a
single host and are not able to capture all events in the network and they are
associated with a great integration effort. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
method for intrusion detection that combines distributed agents on Industrial
Internet of Things (IIoT) edge devices with a centralized logging. In contrast
to existing IDSs, the distributed approach is suitable for industrial low
performance microcontrollers. We demonstrate a Proof of Concept (PoC)
implementation on a MCU running FreeRTOS with LwIP and show the feasibility of
our approach in an IIoT application.

and are envisioned to promote 6G communication networks. In this paper, for
wireless communications aided by IRS units, we formulate optimization problems
for power control under quality of service (QoS) and max-min fair QoS under
three kinds of traffic patterns from a base station (BS) to mobile users (MUs):
unicast, broadcast, and multicast. The optimizations are achieved by jointly
designing the transmit beamforming of the BS and the phase shift matrix of the
IRS. For power control under QoS, existing IRS studies in the literature
address only the unicast setting, whereas no IRS work has considered max-min
fair QoS. Furthermore, we extend our above optimization studies to the novel
settings of multi-antenna mobile users or/and multiple intelligent reflecting
surfaces. For all the above optimizations, we provide detailed analyses to
propose efficient algorithms. To summarize, our paper presents a comprehensive
study of optimization problems involving power control, QoS, and fairness in
wireless networks enhanced by IRSs.

classically in classification and more recently for inference post model

researchers wanted to create a scoring system to quickly assess physical
activity levels. A score is created using a large cohort study. Then, using the
same data, this score serves as a covariate in a model for the risk of disease
or mortality. Since the data are used twice in this way, standard errors and
confidence intervals from fitting the second model are not valid. To allow for
proper inference, sample splitting can be used. One builds the score with a
random half of the data and then uses the score when fitting a model to the
other half of the data. We derive the limiting distribution of the estimators.
An obvious question is what happens if multiple sample splits are performed. We
show that as the number of sample splits increases, the combination of multiple
sample splits is effectively equivalent to solving a set of estimating

to cognize new things. Supposing you are a zoologist, for a presented animal
image, you can recognize it immediately if you know its class. Otherwise, you
would more likely attempt to cognize it by exploiting the side-information
(e.g., semantic information, etc.) you have accumulated. Inspired by this, this
paper decomposes the generalized zero-shot learning (G-ZSL) task into an open
set recognition (OSR) task and a zero-shot learning (ZSL) task, where OSR
recognizes seen classes (if we have seen (or known) them) and rejects unseen
classes (if we have never seen (or known) them before), while ZSL identifies
the unseen classes rejected by the former. Simultaneously, without violating
OSR's assumptions (only known class knowledge is available in training), we
also first attempt to explore a new generalized open set recognition (G-OSR) by
introducing the accumulated side-information from known classes to OSR. For
G-ZSL, such a decomposition effectively solves the class overfitting problem
with easily misclassifying unseen classes as seen classes. The problem is
ubiquitous in most existing G-ZSL methods. On the other hand, for G-OSR,
introducing such semantic information of known classes not only improves the
recognition performance but also endows OSR with the cognitive ability of
unknown classes. Specifically, a visual and semantic prototypes-jointly guided
convolutional neural network (VSG-CNN) is proposed to fulfill these two tasks

captures on medium-heavy nuclei drive deleptonization and simulations require
the use of accurate reaction rates. Nuclei with neutron number near $N=50$,
just above atomic number $Z=28$, play an important role, but rates used in
astrophysical simulations rely primarily on a relatively simple single-state
approximation. In order to improve the accuracy of astrophysical simulations,
experimental data are needed to test the electron-capture rates and to guide
the development of better theoretical models. This work presents the results of
the $^{86}$Kr($t$,$^{3}$He+$\gamma$) experiment at the NSCL, from which an
upper limit for the Gamow-Teller strength up to an excitation energy in
$^{86}$Br of 5 MeV is extracted. The derived upper limit for the
electron-capture rate on $^{86}$Kr indicates that the rate estimated through
the single-state approximation is too high and that rates based on Gamow-Teller
strengths estimated in shell-model and QRPA calculations are more accurate. The
QRPA calculations tested in this manner were used for estimating the electron
capture rates for 78 isotopes near $N=50$ and above $Z=28$. The impact of using
these new electron-capture rates in simulations of supernovae instead of the
rates based on the single-state approximation is investigated, indicating a
significant reduction in the deleptonization that affects multi-messenger
signals, such as the emission of neutrinos and gravitational waves.

  The space $\mathcal D$ of densities on phase space is the state space of a

bracket on functions on $\mathcal D$. In the absence of monopoles, this is
again a Poisson bracket. It has recently been shown by Heninger and Morrison

turbulence simulations are often conducted in the isothermal limit. Given that
the majority of astrophysical systems are not governed by isothermal dynamics,
we aim to quantify the impact of thermodynamics on the physics of turbulence,
through varying adiabatic index, $\gamma$, combined with a range of optically
thin cooling functions. In this paper, we present a suite of ideal
magnetohydrodynamics simulations of thermally balanced stationary turbulence in
the subsonic, super-Alfv\'enic, high beta (ratio of thermal to magnetic
pressure) regime, where turbulent dissipation is balanced by two idealized
cooling functions (approximating linear cooling and free-free emission) and
examine the impact of the equation of state by considering cases that
correspond to isothermal, monatomic and diatomic gases. We find a strong
anticorrelation between thermal and magnetic pressure independent of
thermodynamics, whereas the strong anticorrelation between density and magnetic
field found in the isothermal case weakens with increasing $\gamma$. Similarly,
with the linear relation between variations in density and thermal pressure
with sonic Mach number becomes steeper with increasing $\gamma$. This suggests
that there exists a degeneracy in these relations with respect to
thermodynamics and Mach number in this regime, which is dominated by slow
magnetosonic modes. These results have implications for attempts to infer
(e.g.) Mach numbers from (e.g.) Faraday rotation measurements, without
additional information regarding the thermodynamics of the plasma. However, our
results suggest that this degeneracy can be broken by utilizing higher-order

determine the optimum configuration of cloud resources. The number of stations
was varied to determine the scaling of correlation time with VLBI arrays of
different sizes. Data transfer rates from Google Cloud Storage to the Virtual

comparison between cloud and cluster processing. The economic comparisons are
based on cost figures which are a moving target, and are highly dependent on
factors such as the utilization of cluster and media, which are a challenge to
estimate. Our model suggests that shifting to the cloud is an alternative path
for high data rate, low duty cycle wideband VLBI correlation that should

light-cone front, which expands at finite velocity. Despite being a fundamental
result, existing bounds are often extremely loose, limiting their applications.
We introduce a method that dramatically and qualitatively improves LR bounds in
models with finite-range interactions. Most prominently, in systems with a
large local Hilbert space dimension $D$, our method gives an LR velocity that
grows much slower than previous bounds with $D$ as $D\to \infty$. For example,
in the Heisenberg model with spin $S$, we find $v\leq$ const. compared to the
previous $v\propto S$ which diverges at large $S$, and in multiorbital Hubbard
models with $N$ orbitals, we find $v\propto \sqrt{N}$ instead of previous
$v\propto N$, and similarly in the $N$-state truncated Bose-Hubbard model and
Wen's quantum rotor model. Our bounds also scale qualitatively better in some
systems when the spatial dimension or certain model parameters become large,
for example in the $d$-dimensional quantum Ising model and perturbed toric code
models. Even in spin-1/2 Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models, our method improves
the LR velocity by an order of magnitude with typical model parameters, and
significantly improves the LR bound at large distance and early time.

the associated wormhole traversable and suggests it can become eternally
traversable at the limit where the background becomes extremal. A key technical
step is the proper formulation of the method of images for fermions in curved
spacetime. We find the stress-energy of spinor fields to have important
kinematic differences from that of scalar fields, typically causing the sign of
the integrated null stress-energy (and thus in many cases the sign of the time

first-principles calculations predict an insulating electronic state,
incompatible with superconducting instability. To overcome this problem, we
take into account electron correlation effects by a GGA$+U$ method and show the
insulator-metal transition by Coulomb interaction. Using Fermi surfaces
obtained as a function of $U$, we clarify topological properties of possible
superconducting states. Fermi surface formulas for the three-dimensional
winding number and three two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ numbers indicate
topological superconductivity at an intermediate $U$ for all the odd-parity
pairing symmetry in the $Immm$ space group. Symmetry and topology of
superconducting gap node are analyzed and the gap structure of UTe$_2$ is
predicted. Topologically protected low-energy excitations are highlighted, and
experiments by bulk and surface probes are proposed to link Fermi surfaces and
pairing symmetry. Based on the results, we also discuss multiple
superconducting phases under magnetic fields, which were implied by recent
experiments.

regulate the noise by enhancing instance-specific information to obtain a
better regularization effect. Therefore, we propose an attention-based BN

capacity of regulating noise and stabilizing network training to improve
generalization even in the presence of two kinds of noise attacks during

motion transfer for generating person videos, which provides controls on both
the appearance and the motion. Specifically, we transfer the motion of one
person in a target video to another person in a source video, while preserving
the appearance of the source person. Besides only relying on one source frame
as the existing state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method integrates
information from multiple source frames based on a spatio-temporal attention
mechanism to preserve rich appearance details. In addition to a spatial
discriminator employed for encouraging the frame-level fidelity, a multi-range
temporal discriminator is adopted to enforce the generated video to resemble
temporal dynamics of a real video in various time ranges. A challenging
real-world dataset, which contains about 500 dancing video clips with complex
and unpredictable motions, is collected for the training and testing. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed method can produce more photo-realistic and
temporally consistent person videos than previous methods. As our method
decomposes the syntheses of the foreground and background into two branches, a
flexible background substitution application can also be achieved.

methods that built upon it, are able to provide immediate monitoring for plant
growth status to guarantee the output. Although 3D plant point clouds contain
abundant phenotypic features, plant leaves are usually distributed in clusters
and are sometimes seriously overlapped in the canopy. Therefore, it is still a
big challenge to automatically segment each individual leaf from a highly
crowded plant canopy in 3D for plant phenotyping purposes. In this work, we
propose an overlapping-free individual leaf segmentation method for plant point
clouds using the 3D filtering and facet region growing. In order to separate
leaves with different overlapping situations, we develop a new 3D joint
filtering operator, which integrates a Radius-based Outlier Filter (RBOF) and a
Surface Boundary Filter (SBF) to help to separate occluded leaves. By
introducing the facet over-segmentation and facet-based region growing, the
noise in segmentation is suppressed and labeled leaf centers can expand to
their whole leaves, respectively. Our method can work on point clouds generated
from three types of 3D imaging platforms, and also suitable for different kinds
of plant species. In experiments, it obtains a point-level cover rate of 97%
for Epipremnum aureum, 99% for Monstera deliciosa, 99% for Calathea makoyana,
and 87% for Hedera nepalensis sample plants. At the leaf level, our method
reaches an average Recall at 100.00%, a Precision at 99.33%, and an average
F-measure at 99.66%, respectively. The proposed method can also facilitate the
automatic traits estimation of each single leaf (such as the leaf area, length,
and width), which has potential to become a highly effective tool for plant
research and agricultural engineering.

exhibits essentially the same charge radius as $^{40}{\rm Ca}$ does. A
fundamental microscopic description of this is still lacking. Also strange is a
peak in charge radius of calcium at N = 24. The $^{52}{\rm Ca}$ (N = 32)
nucleus, well known to be doubly magical, amazingly has recently been found to
have a very large charge radius. Also amazing is the property of
$^{42}_{14}{\rm Si}_{28}$ which simultaneously appears to be both
magical/spherical and strongly deformed as well. We use a Quantum
Chromodynamics based model, which treats triton as elementary entity to make up
$^{42}_{14}{\rm Si}_{28}$. We show here how this QCD based model is able to
provide a consistent physical understanding of simultaneity of
magicity/sphericity and strong deformation of a single nucleus. This brings in
an essential duality in the structure of $^{42}_{14}{\rm Si}_{28}$ and
subsequently also that of $^{48}_{20}{\rm Ca}_{28}$ We also provide consistent
understanding of the puzzling radii of calcium isotopes. We predict that the
radius of $^{54}{\rm Ca}$ should be even bigger than that of $^{52}{\rm Ca}$;
and also that the radius of $^{60}{\rm Ca}$ should be the same as that of
$^{40}{\rm Ca}$. In addition we also show wherefrom arises the neutron E2

synthetically generated character data, the real data is used to train
efficient convolutional neural networks for character classification serving a
practical runtime as well as a high accuracy. On a dataset with 74 character

presence of receiving users with uneven channel capacities, which often forces
the rate of transmission of each multicasting message to be reduced to that of
the slowest user. This bottleneck, which can be detrimental in general wireless
broadcast settings, motivates the analysis of coded caching over a standard
Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) with K cache-aided

we design a communication algorithm that is based on superposition coding that
capitalizes on the realization that the user with the worst channel may not be
the real bottleneck of communication. We then proceed to provide a converse
that shows the algorithm to be near optimal, identifying the fundamental limits
of this setting within a multiplicative factor of 4. Interestingly, the result
reveals that, even if several users are experiencing channels with reduced
capacity, the system can achieve the same optimal delivery time that would be
achievable if all users enjoyed maximal capacity.

investigate the properties of the transition by studying the behavior of the
entanglement entropy of a subsystem of size $L_A$ in a system of size $L > L_A$
near the critical regime of the many-body localization transition. The
many-body eigenstates are obtained by exact diagonalization of a disordered
quantum spin chain under twisted boundary conditions to reduce the finite-size
effect. We present a scaling theory based on the assumption that the transition
is continuous and use the subsystem size $L_A /\xi$ as the scaling variable,
where $\xi$ is the correlation length. We show that this scaling theory
provides an effective description of the critical behavior and that the
entanglement entropy follows the thermal volume law at the transition point. We
extract the critical exponent governing the divergence of $\xi$ upon
approaching the transition point. We also study the participation entropy in
the spin-basis of the domain wall excitations and show that the transition
point and the critical exponent agree with those obtained from finite size
scaling of the entanglement entropy. Our findings suggest that the many-body

Giotto mission at comet 1P/Halley revealed the presence of complex organics in
the coma. New telescopes and space missions have provided detailed remote and
in situ measurements of the composition of cometary volatiles. Recently, the
Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko more than doubled the number
of parent species and the number of isotopic ratios known in comets. 39 of the
66 parent species have also been detected in pre- and proto-stellar clouds,
making the similarities of cometary ices with pre-stellar material very
intriguing. Most isotopic ratios are non-solar. The variations in D/H in water
between different comets indicate a large range in the protoplanetary disk
where comets formed. All of these results point to a non-homogeneized
protoplanetary disk where comets received their material. This diverse origin
is in contrast to the Sun, who received its material from the bulk of the
collapsing cloud. Detection of N2 and Ar in the coma of 67P and the presence of
very volatile S2 point to low formation temperature of 20-30 K of the comet.
The xenon isotopic ratios measured in 67P can explain the long standing
question about the origin of the terrestrial atmospheric xenon. While we can
exclude comets as being the source of the bulk terrestrial water due to their
generally high D/H, the noble gases in the Earth atmosphere are compatible with
a cometary delivery. This means that the amount of organics delivered by comets
may be highly significant.

this framework, there is no need to change the infrastructures like SIP servers

TeV-order mass. Given its great mass, it must have a large decay width.
Therefore, the interference effect will be very common if they and the
Standard-Model (SM) particles contribute to the same final state.However, the
interference effect could make a new particle show up not like a resonance, and
it is difficult to search and measure its properties. In this work, a
model-independent method, F2F (Fit To Fourier coefficients), is proposed to
search for an unknown resonance and to determine its mass ($M$) and width
($\Gamma$) in the presence of interference. Basically we express the sum of
reosnant signal and the interference as a cosine Fourier series and relate the
Fourier coefficients with the mass and width. The relation is based on the
general propagator form, $1/(x^2-M^2+iM\Gamma)$. Thus it does not need any
signal model. Toy experiments show that the obtained mass and width agree well
with the inputs with a similar precision as using an explicit signal model. We
also show that we can apply this method to measure the Stardard-Model Higgs
width and to make statistic interpretation in searching for new resonance
allowing for interference.

semantic correspondences to the users' query sentences. To tackle such a

convolutional network to model both the sentence-video semantic interaction and
the internal video relationships incorporated with the sentence information,
based on which a temporal conditioned pointer network is then introduced to
sequentially generate the sentence specified video thumbnails. Moreover, we
annotate a new dataset based on ActivityNet Captions for the proposed new task,

nu2=1 vibrational state arising in buried nuclear regions of galaxies,
indicating an efficient pumping of the nu2=1 state through absorption of 14
$\mu$m continuum photons. We have modeled the continuum and HCN vibrational
line emission in these regions, characterized by high column densities of dust
and high luminosities, with a spherically symmetric approach, simulating both a
central heating source (AGN) and a compact nuclear starburst (SB). We find that
when the H2 columns become very high, N_{H2}>~10^{25} cm-2, trapping of
continuum photons within the nuclear region dramatically enhances the dust
temperature (Tdust) in the inner regions, even though the predicted spectral
energy distribution as seen from outside becomes relatively cold. The models
thus predict bright continuum at millimeter wavelengths for luminosity surface
brightness (averaged over the model source) of ~10^{8} Lsun pc^{-2}. This {\it
greenhouse} effect significantly enhances the mean mid-infrared intensity
within the dusty volume, populating the nu2=1 state to the extent that the HCN
vibrational lines become optically thick. AGN models yield higher Tdust in the
inner regions and higher peak (sub)millimeter continuum brightness than SB
models, but similar HCN vibrational J=3-2 and 4-3 emission owing to both
optical depth effects and a moderate impact of high \tdust\ on these low-J
lines. The observed HCN vibrational emission in several galaxies can be
accounted for with a HCN abundance of ~10^{-6} (relative to H2) and luminosity
surface brightness in the range (0.5-2)x10^{8}$ Lsun pc^{-2}, predicting a

evidencing the pre-existence of a quasi-stable magnetic flux rope. The hot
channel underwent an activation phase after a localized and prolonged pre-flare
event occurring adjacent to one of its footpoints. Subsequently, the flux rope
continued to rise slowly for $\approx$16 min during which soft X-ray flux
gradually built-up characterizing a distinct precursor phase. The flux rope
transitioned from the state of slow rise to the eruptive motion with the onset
of the impulsive phase of the X1.0 flare. The eruptive expansion of the hot
channel is accompanied by a series of type III radio bursts in association with
impulsive rise of strong hard X-ray non-thermal emissions that included
explicit hard X-ray sources of energies up to $\approx$50 keV from the coronal
loops and $\approx$100 keV from their footpoint locations. Our study contains
evidence that pre-flare activity occurring within the spatial extent of a
stable flux rope can destabilize it toward eruption. Moreover, sudden
transition of the flux rope from the state of slow rise to fast acceleration
precisely bifurcated the precursor and the impulsive phases of the flare which
points toward a feedback relationship between early CME dynamics and the
strength of the large-scale magnetic reconnection.

This work takes inspiration from two strategies used by the brain to achieve
this energy efficiency: the absence of separation between computing and memory

resistive memory technologies indeed provides an opportunity to co-integrate
tightly logic and memory in hardware. In parallel, the recently proposed
concept of Binarized Neural Network, where multiplications are replaced by
exclusive NOR (XNOR) logic gates, offers a way to implement artificial
intelligence using very low precision computation. In this work, we therefore
propose a strategy to implement low energy Binarized Neural Networks, which
employs brain-inspired concepts, while retaining energy benefits from digital
electronics. We design, fabricate and test a memory array, including periphery
and sensing circuits, optimized for this in-memory computing scheme. Our
circuit employs hafnium oxide resistive memory integrated in the back end of
line of a 130 nanometer CMOS process, in a two transistors - two resistors
cell, which allows performing the exclusive NOR operations of the neural
network directly within the sense amplifiers. We show, based on extensive
electrical measurements, that our design allows reducing the amount of bit
errors on the synaptic weights, without the use of formal error correcting
codes. We design a whole system using this memory array. We show on standard
machine learning tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet and an ECG task) that the
system has an inherent resilience to bit errors. We evidence that its energy
consumption is attractive compared to more standard approaches, and that it can
use the memory devices in regimes where they exhibit particularly low

correlated observation error covariance (OEC) information in data assimilation
and forecasting systems. However, diagnosed OEC matrices are often
ill-conditioned and may cause convergence problems for variational data
assimilation procedures. Reconditioning methods are used to improve the
conditioning of covariance matrices while retaining correlation information. In
this paper we study the impact of using the 'ridge regression' method of
reconditioning to assimilate Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer
(IASI) observations in the Met Office 1D-Var system. This is the first
systematic investigation of how changing target condition numbers affects
convergence of a 1D-Var routine. This procedure is used for quality control,
and to estimate key variables (skin temperature, cloud top pressure, cloud
fraction) that are not analysed by the main 4D-Var data assimilation system.
Our new results show that the current (uncorrelated) OEC matrix requires more
iterations to reach convergence than any choice of correlated OEC matrix
studied. This suggests that using a correlated OEC matrix in the 1D-Var routine
would have computational benefits for IASI observations. Using reconditioned
correlated OEC matrices also increases the number of observations that pass
quality control. However, the impact on skin temperature, cloud fraction and
cloud top pressure is less clear. As the reconditioning parameter is increased,
differences between retrieved variables for correlated OEC matrices and the
operational diagonal OEC matrix reduce. As correlated choices of OEC matrix
yield faster convergence, using stricter convergence criteria along with these
matrices may increase efficiency and improve quality control.

Intelligence by orders of magnitude with regards to its implementation on
computers and graphics cards. In particular, ST-MRAM could be ideal for
implementing Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), a type of deep neural networks
discovered in 2016, which can achieve state-of-the-art performance with a
highly reduced memory footprint with regards to conventional artificial
intelligence approaches. The challenge of ST-MRAM, however, is that it is prone
to write errors and usually requires the use of error correction. In this work,
we show that these bit errors can be tolerated by BNNs to an outstanding level,
based on examples of image recognition tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet):
bit error rates of ST-MRAM up to 0.1% have little impact on recognition
accuracy. The requirements for ST-MRAM are therefore considerably relaxed for
BNNs with regards to traditional applications. By consequence, we show that for
BNNs, ST-MRAMs can be programmed with weak (low-energy) programming conditions,
without error correcting codes. We show that this result can allow the use of
low energy and low area ST-MRAM cells, and show that the energy savings at the
system level can reach a factor two.

rigorously. Higher-order moments of the relevant bosonic operators are computed
to test the nonclassicality of the state of interest, which reduces to various
quantum states (having applications in quantum optics, metrology and
information processing) in different limits ranging from the coherent
(classical) state to the Fock (most nonclassical) states. The nonclassical
features are discussed using Klyshko's, Vogel's, and Agarwal-Tara's criteria as
well as the criteria of lower- and higher-order antibunching, sub-Poissonian
photon statistics and squeezing. In addition, phase distribution function and
quantum phase fluctuation have been studied. These properties are examined for
various combinations of number of photon addition and/or subtraction and Fock
parameter. The examination has revealed that photon addition generally improves
nonclassicality, and this advantage enhances for the large (small) values of
displacement parameter using photon subtraction (Fock parameter). The
higher-order sub-Poissonian photon statistics is only observed for the odd
orders. In general, higher-order nonclassicality criteria are found to detect
nonclassicality even in the cases when corresponding lower-order criteria
failed to do so. Photon subtraction is observed to induce squeezing, but only
large number of photon addition can be used to probe squeezing for large values
of displacement parameter. Further, photon subtraction is found to alter the
phase properties more than photon addition, while Fock parameter has an
opposite effect of the photon addition/subtraction. Finally, nonclassicality
and non-Gaussianity is also established using $Q$ function.

and square root kinetic corrections. In modern cosmology, the generalised
second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) plays an important role in deciding
thermodynamical compliance of a model as one cannot consider a model to be
viable if it fails to respect GSLT. Hence, for comparing thermodynamical
viability, we examine the validity of GSLT for these two models. For this
purpose, by employing the Unified first law (UFL), we calculate the total
entropy of these two models in apparent and event horizons. The validity of
GSLT is then examined from the autonomous systems as the original expressions
of total entropy are very complicated. Although, at the background level, both
models give interesting cosmological dynamics, however, thermodynamically we
found that the square kinetic correction is more realistic as compared to the
square root kinetic correction. More precisely, the GSLT holds for the square
kinetic correction throughout the evolutionary history except only during the
radiation epoch where the scalar field may not represent a true description of
the matter content. On the other hand, the square root kinetic model fails to
satisfy the GSLT in major cosmological eras.

many vision-and-language tasks that require a synergic understanding of both

co-attention models to associate each visual object (e.g., image region) with
each textual object (e.g., query word). Despite the success of these
co-attention models, they only model inter-modal interactions while neglecting
intra-modal interactions. Here we propose a general `unified attention' model
that simultaneously captures the intra- and inter-modal interactions of
multimodal features and outputs their corresponding attended representations.
By stacking such unified attention blocks in depth, we obtain the deep
Multimodal Unified Attention Network (MUAN), which can seamlessly be applied to
the visual question answering (VQA) and visual grounding tasks. We evaluate our
MUAN models on two VQA datasets and three visual grounding datasets, and the
results show that MUAN achieves top-level performance on both tasks without

whom the holders send their notes in order to carry out transactions. The key
aspects of our money scheme include: note verification procedure requiring a
single round classical interaction between the local verifier and Bank; fixed
verification circuit that uses only passive linear optical components;
re-usability of each note in our scheme which grows linearly with the size of
note, and an unconditional security against any adversary trying to forge the
banknote while tolerating the noise of up to 21.4%. We further describe a
practical implementation technique of our money scheme using weak coherent
states of light and the verification circuit involving a single 50/50beam

number of optical components increase proportionally to the increase in desired
noise tolerance (robustness). In contrast, we achieve any desired noise
tolerance (up to a maximal threshold value) with only a fixed number of optical
components. This considerable reduction of components in our scheme enables us
to reach the robustness values that are not feasible for any existing money

for application on different simulated and in-vivo datasets including

patch-based convolutional neural networks were trained to predict conductivity
maps from B1 transceive phase data. To compare the performance of DLEPT
networks on different datasets, three datasets were used throughout this work,
one from simulations and two from in-vivo measurements from healthy volunteers
and cancer patients, respectively. At first, networks trained on simulations
are tested on all datasets with different levels of homogeneous Gaussian noise
introduced in training and testing. Secondly, to investigate potential
robustness towards systematical differences between simulated and measured
phase maps, in-vivo data with conductivity labels from conventional EPT is used
for training. Results: High quality of reconstructions from networks trained on
simulations with and without noise confirms the potential of deep learning for
EPT. However, artifact encumbered results in this work uncover challenges in
application of DLEPT to in-vivo data. Training DLEPT networks on conductivity
labels from conventional EPT improves quality of results. This is argued to be
caused by robustness to artifacts from image acquisition. Conclusions: Networks
trained on simulations with added homogeneous Gaussian noise yield
reconstruction artifacts when applied to in-vivo data. Training with realistic
phase data and conductivity labels from conventional EPT allows for severely
reducing these artifacts.

the proposed block enhances the discriminative ability of the feature

of physics and engineering domains for its ability to solve decision-making
problems that were previously out of reach due to a combination of
non-linearity and high dimensionality. In the last few years, it has spread in
the field of computational mechanics, and particularly in fluid dynamics, with
recent applications in flow control and shape optimization. In this work, we
conduct a detailed review of existing DRL applications to fluid mechanics
problems. In addition, we present recent results that further illustrate the
potential of DRL in Fluid Mechanics. The coupling methods used in each case are
covered, detailing their advantages and limitations. Our review also focuses on
the comparison with classical methods for optimal control and optimization.
Finally, several test cases are described that illustrate recent progress made
in this field. The goal of this publication is to provide an understanding of
DRL capabilities along with state-of-the-art applications in fluid dynamics to
researchers wishing to address new problems with these methods.

measure the recombination fluctuations in the number of electrons and photons

quadrupole trap by typically applying a sinusoidal electric field. When a
charged drop is levitated it exhibits surface oscillations simultaneously
building charge density due to continuous evaporation and subsequently
undergoes breakup due to Rayleigh instability. In this work, we examined
large-amplitude surface oscillations of a sub-Rayleigh charged drop and its
subsequent breakup, levitated by various applied signals such as sine, square
and ramp waveform at various imposed frequencies, using high-speed imaging
(recorded at 100-130 thousand Frames Per Second (fps)). It is observed that the
drop surface oscillates in sphere-prolate-sphere-oblate (SPSO) mode and seldom
in the sphere-prolate-sphere (SPS) mode depending on the intricate interplay of
various forces due to charge(q), the intensity of applied field ($\Lambda$) and
shift of the droplet from the geometric center of the trap ($z_{shift}$). The
Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis shows that the droplet oscillates
with the forced frequency irrespective of the type of the applied waveform.
While in the sinusoidal case, the nonlinearities are significant, in the square
and ramp potentials, there is an admittance of all the harmonic frequencies of
the applied potential. Interestingly, the breakup characteristics of a
critically charged droplet is found to be unaffected by the type of the applied
waveform. The experimental observations are validated with an analytical theory
as well as with the Boundary Integral (BI) simulations in the potential flow
limit and the results are found to be in a reasonable agreement.

and lognormal functional forms both physically motivated. In this paper, we use
artificial time series generated using the prescription of Timmer & Koenig to
investigate connections between the PDF and PSD. PDFs calculated for these
artificial light curves are less likely to be well described by a Gaussian
functional form for steep (<-1) PSD spectral indices due to weak
non-stationarity. Using the Fermi LAT monthly light curve of the blazar

form. Here, we generate large numbers of artificial light curves with
intrinsically normally distributed PDFs and with statistical properties
consistent with observations. These are used to evaluate the probabilities that
either Gaussian or lognormal functional forms better describe the PDF. We use
this prescription to show that PKS2155-304 requires a high prior probability of

strong eccentricity growth due to the Kozai-Lidov (KL) mechanism. The KL effect
acts on a disc that is highly inclined to the binary orbital plane provided
that the disc aspect ratio is sufficiently small. The eccentric disc overflows
its Roche lobe and material flows from the Be star disc over to the companion
neutron star causing X-ray activity. With N-body simulations and steady state
decretion disc models we explore system parameters for which a disc in the
Be/X-ray binary 4U 0115+634 is KL unstable and the resulting timescale for the
oscillations. We find good agreement between predictions of the model and the
observed giant outburst timescale provided that the disc is not completely
destroyed by the outburst. This allows the outer disc to be replenished between
outbursts and a sufficiently short KL oscillation timescale. An initially
eccentric disc has a shorter KL oscillation timescale compared to an initially
circular orbit disc. We suggest that the chaotic nature of the outbursts is
caused by the sensitivity of the mechanism to the distribution of material
within the disc. The outbursts continue provided that the Be star supplies
material that is sufficiently misaligned to the binary orbital plane. We
generalise our results to Be/X-ray binaries with varying orbital period and
find that if the Be star disc is flared, it is more likely to be unstable to KL
oscillations in a smaller orbital period binary, in agreement with
observations.

Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (statDMFT). This theory is a natural extension of
the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), which has been used with relative
success in the last several years with the purpose of describing the Mott
transition in the clean case. As is the case for the latter theory, the
statDMFT incorporates the electronic correlation effects only in their local
manifestations. Disorder, on the other hand, is treated in such a way as to
incorporate Anderson localization effects. With this technique, we analyzed the
disordered two-dimensional Mott transition, using Quantum Monte Carlo to solve
the associated single-impurity problems. We found spinodal lines at which the
metal and insulator cease to be meta-stable. We also studied spatial
fluctuations of local quantities, such as the self-energy and the local Green's
function, and showed the appearance of metallic regions within the insulator
and vice-versa. We carried out an analysis of finite-size effects and showed
that, in agreement with the theorems of Imry and Ma, the first-order transition
is smeared in the thermodynamic limit. We analyzed transport properties by
means of a mapping to a random classical resistor network and calculated both
the average current and its distribution across the metal-insulator transition.

find that the scalaron dynamics is governed by the $R^{2}$ term and the

model-independent regarding the low-energy scale modification. In viable $F(R)$

scalaron universally evolves in a way with a bouncing oscillation irrespective

Consequently, we find a universal bound on the scalaron mass in the BBN epoch,
to be reflected on the constraint for the coupling strength of the $R^2$ term,
which turns out to be more stringent than the one coming from the fifth force
experiments. It is then shown that the scalaron naturally develops a small
enough fluctuation in the BBN epoch, hence can avoid the current BBN constraint

the current i-FCIQMC scheme, the space of initiators is chosen dynamically by a
population threshold. Here, we instead choose initiators as the selected space
(V) from a prior SCI calculation, allowing substantially larger initiator
spaces for a given walker population. While SCI+PT2 adds a perturbative
correction in the first-order interacting space (FOIS) beyond V, the approach
presented here allows a variational calculation in the same space, and a
perturbative correction in the second-order interacting space. The use of a
fixed initiator space reintroduces population plateaus into FCIQMC, but it is
shown that the plateau height is typically only a small multiple of the size of
V. Thus, for a comparable fundamental memory cost to SCI+PT2, a substantially
larger space can be sampled. The resulting method can be seen as a
complementary approach to SCI+PT2, which is more accurate but slower for a
common selected/initiator space. More generally, our results show that
approaches exist to significantly improve initiator energies in i-FCIQMC, while
still ameliorating the fermion sign problem relative to the original FCIQMC
method.

little order dependence. A one-dimensional two-band model, combined with a

binary PSR J2032+4127/MT91 213. PSR J2032+4127 is a 143-ms gamma-ray pulsar
which shares a long period (45-50 year) and highly eccentric orbit with the
massive Be star MT91 213. TeV gamma-ray emission was detected from the binary
following a coordinated observing campaign over the fall 2017 periastron with
VERITAS, MAGIC, and X-ray monitoring with Swift-XRT. The discovery of this
gamma-ray binary makes it just the second such source known to contain a pulsar
as the compact object. We report on over 100 hours of extensive TeV
observations across the periastron passage, which reveal variations in the TeV
flux by an order of magnitude over time scales of days. The X-ray flux was also
found to be highly variable, although it was not directly correlated with the
TeV flux. These observations present serious challenges to existing models of
the system, which will require significant revisions. We also discuss the
steady and extended TeV source TeV J2032+4130, which lies in the same direction
as the binary system, and its potential association with the pulsar.

stars similar to Trappist-1, through the accretion of either planetesimals or
pebbles. The aim is to determine if the currently observed systems around low
mass stars favour one scenario over the other. We ran numerous N-body
simulations, coupled to a thermally evolving viscous disc model, including
prescriptions for planet migration and photoevaporation. We examine the
differences between the pebble and planetesimal accretion scenarios, but also
look at the influences of disc mass, planetesimal size, and the percentage of
solids locked up within pebbles. When comparing the resulting planetary systems
to Trappist-1, we find that a wide range of initial conditions for both
accretion scenarios can form planetary systems similar to Trappist-1, in terms
of planet mass, periods, and resonant configurations. Typically these planets
formed exterior to the water iceline and migrated in resonant convoys to close
to the central star. When comparing the planetary systems formed from pebbles
to those formed from planetesimals, we find a large number of similarities,
including average planet masses, eccentricities, inclinations and period
ratios. One major difference was that of the water content of the planets. When
including the effects of ablation and full recycling of the planets envelope
with the disc, planets formed from pebbles were extremely dry, whilst those
formed from planetesimals were extremely wet. If the water content is not fully
recycled and instead falls to the planets core, or if ablation of the water is
neglected, then the planets formed from pebbles are extremely wet, similar to
those formed from planetesimals. Should the water content of the Trappist-1
planets be determined accurately, this could point to a preferred formation
pathway for planetary systems, or to specific physics that may be at play.

problem caused by domain differences. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Domain-Specific Embedding Network (DSEN) that can apply specific projections to
different domains for unbiased embedding, as well as several domain
constraints. In contrast to previous methods, the DSEN decomposes the
domain-shared projection function into one domain-invariant and two
domain-specific sub-functions to explore the similarities and differences
between two domains. To prevent the two specific projections from breaking the
semantic relationship, a semantic reconstruction constraint is proposed by
applying the same decoder function to them in a cycle consistency way.
Furthermore, a domain division constraint is developed to directly penalize the
margin between real and pseudo image features in respective seen and unseen
domains, which can enlarge the inter-domain difference of visual features.
Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of DSEN with an average of $9.2\%$ improvement in terms of harmonic mean. The

  Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters",,"10.3847/2041-8213/ab3fb3",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) are the evolutionary products of trans-Neptunian
objects (TNOs) that evolve through the giant planet region as Centaurs and into
the inner solar system. Through numerical orbital evolution calculations
following a large number of TNO test particles that enter the Centaur
population, we have identified a short-lived dynamical Gateway, a temporary
low-eccentricity region exterior to Jupiter through which the majority of JFCs
pass. We apply an observationally based size distribution function to the known
Centaur population and obtain an estimated Gateway region population. We then
apply an empirical fading law to the rate of incoming JFCs implied by the the
Gateway region residence times. Our derived estimates are consistent with
observed population numbers for the JFC and Gateway populations. Currently, the
most notable occupant of the Gateway region is 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1
(SW1), a highly active, regularly outbursting Centaur. SW1's present-day,
very-low-eccentricity orbit was established after a 1975 Jupiter conjunction
and will persist until a 2038 Jupiter conjunction doubles its eccentricity and
pushes its semi-major axis out to its current aphelion. Subsequent evolution
will likely drive SW1's orbit out of the Gateway region, perhaps becoming one
of the largest JFCs in recorded history. The JFC Gateway region coincides with
a heliocentric distance range where the activity of observed cometary bodies
increases significantly. SW1's activity may be typical of the early
evolutionary processing experienced by most JFCs. Thus, the Gateway region, and
its most notable occupant SW1, are critical to both the dynamical and physical
transition between Centaurs and JFCs.

the supercooling transition line, $T^{*}_ {v} (p,H)$. In zero field the vortex
phases of $^3$He-B are separated by a first-order phase transition line $T_ {v}

The low-pressure, low-temperature phase is characterized by an array of
singly-quantized vortices that spontaneously breaks axial rotation symmetry,
exhibits anisotropic vortex currents and an axial current anomaly (D-core

with both bulk A phase and $\beta$ phase in their cores (A-core phase). We show
that this phase is metastable and supercools down to a minimum temperature,
$T^{*}_ {v} (p,H)$, below which it is globally unstable to an array of D-core
vortices. For $H\gtrsim 60\,\mbox{G}$ external magnetic fields aligned along

example, the intense turbulence stirred up at the bow shock and foreshock have
been shown to open up pathways for high velocity solar wind parcels to bypass
the protective shield of the terrestrial magnetosphere and create disturbances
in the ionosphere and lower atmosphere. A primary challenge in understanding
kinetic turbulence and its global implications is its multi-scale nature,
spanning from electron scales to macro scales of the magnetosphere. Current
four-spacecraft missions with 3D formations, the Magnetospheric Multiscale

this problem by proposing a fast, parameter-free and scene-adaptable deep tone

quality tone mapped output. Based on conditional generative adversarial network
(cGAN), DeepTMO not only learns to adapt to vast scenic-content (e.g., outdoor,
indoor, human, structures, etc.) but also tackles the HDR related
scene-specific challenges such as contrast and brightness, while preserving the
fine-grained details. We explore 4 possible combinations of
Generator-Discriminator architectural designs to specifically address some
prominent issues in HDR related deep-learning frameworks like blurring, tiling
patterns and saturation artifacts. By exploring different influences of scales,
loss-functions and normalization layers under a cGAN setting, we conclude with
adopting a multi-scale model for our task. To further leverage on the
large-scale availability of unlabeled HDR data, we train our network by
generating targets using an objective HDR quality metric, namely Tone Mapping
Image Quality Index (TMQI). We demonstrate results both quantitatively and
qualitatively, and showcase that our DeepTMO generates high-resolution,
high-quality output images over a large spectrum of real-world scenes. Finally,
we evaluate the perceived quality of our results by conducting a pair-wise

Monotone 3-Sat is the restriction of 3-Sat to monotone formulas, i.e. to

dominates over charge accumulation. Thus, our work suggests that triboelectric

introduce individualized mixing weights to handle the variance of predictive
confidence of Gaussian process models. The proposed model is compared with
several state-of-the-art imputation algorithms on both real-world and synthetic
datasets. Experiments show that our best model can provide more accurate
imputation than the benchmarks on all of our datasets.

most important problems for observational cosmology. However, spectroscopic
confirmation of most objects in upcoming photometric surveys, such as the The
Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will be unfeasible.
The development of automated classification processes based on photometry has
thus become crucial. In this paper we investigate the performance of machine
learning (ML) classification on the final cosmological constraints using
simulated lightcurves from The Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge,
released in 2010. We study the use of different feature sets for the
lightcurves and many different ML pipelines based on either decision tree
ensembles or automated search processes. To construct the final catalogs we
propose a threshold selection method, by employing a \emph{Bias-Variance
tradeoff}. This is a very robust and efficient way to minimize the Mean Squared
Error. With this method we were able to get very strong cosmological
constraints, which allowed us to keep $\sim 75\%$ of the total information in
the type Ia SNe when using the SALT2 feature set and $\sim 33\%$ for the other
cases (based on either the Newling model or on standard wavelet decomposition).

two of its core components: self-attention and contextual embeddings. In
particular, we study the identifiability of attention weights and token
embeddings, and the aggregation of context into hidden tokens. We show that,
for sequences longer than the attention head dimension, attention weights are
not identifiable. We propose effective attention as a complementary tool for
improving explanatory interpretations based on attention. Furthermore, we show
that input tokens retain to a large degree their identity across the model. We
also find evidence suggesting that identity information is mainly encoded in
the angle of the embeddings and gradually decreases with depth. Finally, we
demonstrate strong mixing of input information in the generation of contextual
embeddings by means of a novel quantification method based on gradient
attribution. Overall, we show that self-attention distributions are not
directly interpretable and present tools to better understand and further
investigate Transformer models.

astrophysical processes such as the formation of the first stars, galaxies,
(super)massive black holes and enrichment of the pristine gas from z~6 to z~30,

particle physics at redshifts beyond that. As one enters the Dark Ages (z>30),
the Universe becomes pristine. Ground-based low-frequency radio telescopes aim
to detect the spatial fluctuations of the 21-cm signal. Complementary, global
21-cm experiments aim to measure the sky-averaged 21-cm signal. Escaping RFI
and the ionosphere has motivated space-based missions, such as the
Dutch-Chinese NCLE instrument (currently in lunar L2), the proposed US-driven
lunar or space-based instruments DAPPER and FARSIDE, the lunar-orbit

argue for the development of new technologies enabling interferometers to be
deployed, in space (e.g. Earth-Sun L2) or in the lunar vicinity (e.g. surface,

stable environment beyond the reach of most RFI from Earth and its ionospheric
corruptions, enabling them to probe the Dark Ages as well as the Cosmic Dawn,

a deep Q-network to allocate resources and then sends the decision results to

learns to quantize the continuous feedback. In addition, we devise a mechanism
to balance the transmission of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links and
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. To further facilitate distributed

massive stars, all of them invigorating their host galaxies with ionizing
photons, kinetic energy, fresh material and stellar-mass black holes.
Ubiquitous engines as they are, Astrophysics needs a good understanding of
their formation, evolution, properties and yields throughout the history of the
Universe, and with decreasing metal content mimicking the environment at the
earliest epochs. Ultimately, a physical model that could be extrapolated to
zero metallicity would enable tackling long-standing questions such as ""What
did the First, very massive stars of the Universe look like?"" or ""What was
their role in the re-ionization of the Universe?"".
  Yet, most our knowledge of metal-poor massive stars is drawn from one single
point in metallicity. Massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, $\sim
1/5 Z_{\odot}$) currently serve as templates for low-metallicity objects in the
early Universe, even though significant differences with respect to massive
stars with poorer metal content have been reported.
  This White Paper summarizes the current knowledge on extremely (sub-SMC)
metal poor massive stars, highlighting the most outstanding open questions and
the need to supersede the SMC as standard. A new paradigm can be built from
nearby extremely metal-poor galaxies that make a new metallicity ladder, but
massive stars in these galaxies are out of reach to current observational
facilities. Such task would require an L-size mission, consisting of a
10m-class space telescope operating in the optical and the ultraviolet ranges.
Alternatively, we propose that ESA unites efforts with NASA to make the LUVOIR
mission concept a reality, thus continuing the successful partnership that made
Hubble Space Telescope one of the greatest observatories of all time.

models. The aim of this work is to present a new friction formulation that can
model the tangential contact behavior between osseointegrated implants and bone

state variable friction law to model a displacement-dependent friction
coefficient. A smooth state function, based on the sliding distance, is used to
model implant debonding. The formulation is implemented in a 3D nonlinear
finite element framework, and it is calibrated with experimental data and
compared to an analytical model for mode III cleavage of a coin-shaped,
titanium implant (Mathieu et al. 2012). Overall, the results show close
agreement with the experimental data, especially the peak and the softening
part of the torque curve with a relative error of less than 2.25 %. In
addition, better estimates of the bone's shear modulus and the adhesion energy

multi-view data clustering algorithms have thus been proposed. The existing
algorithms usually focus on the cooperation of different views in the original
space but neglect the influence of the hidden information among these different
visible views, or they only consider the hidden information between the views.
The algorithms are therefore not efficient since the available information is
not fully excavated, particularly the otherness information in different views
and the consistency information between them. In practice, the otherness and
consistency information in multi-view data are both very useful for effective
clustering analyses. In this study, a Multi-View clustering algorithm developed
with the Cooperation of Visible and Hidden views, i.e., MV-Co-VH, is proposed.
The MV-Co-VH algorithm first projects the multiple views from different visible
spaces to the common hidden space by using the non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) strategy to obtain the common hidden view data.
Collaborative learning is then implemented in the clustering procedure based on
the visible views and the shared hidden view. The results of extensive
experiments on UCI multi-view datasets and real-world image multi-view datasets
show that the clustering performance of the proposed algorithm is competitive
with or even better than that of the existing algorithms.

sport horses with negative impact on performance. Cytology of bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid by use of a scoring system is considered the most sensitive
diagnostic method. Macrophages are classified depending on the degree of
cytoplasmic hemosiderin content. The current gold standard is manual grading,
which is however monotonous and time-consuming. Methods: We evaluated
state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods for single cell macrophage
classification and compared them against the performance of nine cytology
experts and evaluated inter- and intra-observer variability. Additionally, we
evaluated object detection methods on a novel data set of 17 completely
annotated cytology whole slide images (WSI) containing 78,047 hemosiderophages.
Resultsf: Our deep learning-based approach reached a concordance of 0.85,
partially exceeding human expert concordance (0.68 to 0.86, $\mu$=0.73,
$\sigma$ =0.04). Intra-observer variability was high (0.68 to 0.88) and
inter-observer concordance was moderate (Fleiss kappa = 0.67). Our object
detection approach has a mean average precision of 0.66 over the five classes
from the whole slide gigapixel image and a computation time of below two
minutes. Conclusion: To mitigate the high inter- and intra-rater variability,
we propose our automated object detection pipeline, enabling accurate,
reproducible and quick EIPH scoring in WSI.

Aiming at this, a hidden space sharing multi-view fuzzy clustering (HSS-MVFC)
method is proposed in the present study. This method is based on the classical
fuzzy c-means clustering model, and obtains associ-ated information between
different views by introducing shared hidden space. Especially, the shared
hidden space and the fuzzy partition can be learned alternatively and
contribute to each other. Meanwhile, the proposed method uses maximum entropy
strategy to control the weights of different views while learning the shared

to the general belief that the CNTs form bridges between the adjacent grains to
slow down the breaking process. The yield point for the cement paste is
improved up to 25% when prepared with 0.2 % by weight of various types of CNTs.
A significant strength enhancement is observed with carboxyl functionalized
(COOH) CNTs compared to other types. Further, an increase in the concentration
of CNTs up to 0.4 wt% has a negative effect on the strength of the matrix. The
electrostatic potential energy is mapped by using density functional theory
(DFT) with {\omega}B97X-D functional. At lower concentration of CNTs,
ion-dipole interaction in the cement paste and the CNTs creates a very strong
long range intermolecular force. Due to the increased entropy resulting from
the exothermic hydration process, these forces augment the strength of the

This paper proposes an embedded boundary approach for filling this gap, where

smaller images attest time. For instance, we receive a 76.43% top-1 accuracy
using ResNet50 with an image size of 160, which matches the accuracy of the
baseline model with 2x fewer computations. Furthermore, for a given image size
used at test time, we show this method can be exploited either to accelerate
training or the final test accuracy. For example, we are able to reach a 79.27%
accuracy with a model evaluated at a 288 spatial size for a relative
improvement of 14% over the baseline.

solution solves the time-independent incompressible Navier-Stokes system for
the special case in which the external forces vector is a gradient. In a second
step we develop approximate solutions, also for the time independent
incompressible Navier-Stokes system, through the generalized method of lines.
We recall that for such a method, the domain of the partial differential
equation in question is discretized in lines and the concerning solution is
written on these lines as functions of the boundary conditions and boundary
shape. Finally, we emphasize these last main results are established through
applications of the Banach fixed point theorem.

  (Twitter) -- Case study 1","Audience Rating, Twitter, Social Media, TV","IEEE International Conference on Big Data(2018)",,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Japanese TV program 'Drama A' is a drama broadcast from October to
December 2016. The audience rating was sluggish, but this drama marked a high
audience rating in 2016. Since it was popular from the middle, and it was
speculated that there was a part related to social media in the popularity, we
considered existing research methods as a case study. In this paper, we used a
mathematical model of the hit phenomenon to examine the impact of audience
assessment from social media from a sociophysical perspective. We got the same
consideration as the audience rating per minute of video research. This paper
is IEEE BIGDATA2018's Revised paper(Consideration on TV audience rating and
influence of social media).

Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) is proposed for sensing the glucose levels in
mimicking aquatic solutions of concentrations similar to type 2 diabetics. The
bio-sensor is composed of a curved dielectric waveguide coupled to a dielectric
disc resonator that is loaded with the glucose sample under test. The intense
WGM field induced towards the boundary of the DDR is exploited to detect the
slight variations in the dielectric properties of different glucose levels via
tracing the variations in the magnitude of the transmission coefficient S_{21}
in the mm-wave frequency band (49-70 GHz). The WGM resonator shows a high
sensitivity performance (0.025-0.077 dB/(mg/dL)) at the lower-order modes
WGH_{600} and WGH_{700} as demonstrated by simulations in a 3D full-wave EM
solver (Ansys HFSS).

  in harsh environments","6 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1364/AO.58.007760",,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Standard laser based fire detection systems are often based on measuring
variation of optical signal amplitude. However, mechanical noise interference
and loss from dust and steam can obscure the detection signal, resulting in
faulty results or inability to detect a potential fire. The presented fire
detection technology will allow the detection of fire in harsh and dusty areas,
which are prone to fires, where current systems show limited performance or are
unable to operate. It is not the amount of light nor its wavelength that is
used for detecting fire, but how the refractive index randomly fluctuates due
to the heat convection from the fire. In practical terms this means that light
obstruction from ambient dust particles will not be a problem as long as a
small fraction of the light is detected and that fires without visible flames
can still be detected. The standalone laser system consists of a Linux-based
Red Pitaya system, a cheap 650 nm laser diode, and a PIN photo-detector. Laser
light propagates through the monitored area and reflects off a retroreflector
generating a speckle pattern. Every 3 seconds time traces and frequency noise
spectra are measured and 8 descriptors are deduced to identify a potential
fire. Both laboratory and factory acceptance tests have been performed with
success.
