during pre-silicon verification face severe limitations. In this work, we
systematically leverage two key ideas: 1) Symbolic Quick Error Detection
(Symbolic QED or SQED), a recent bug detection and localization technique using
Bounded Model Checking (BMC); and 2) Symbolic starting states, to present a
method that: i) Effectively detects both ""difficult"" logic bugs and Hardware
Trojans, even with long activation sequences where traditional BMC techniques
fail; and ii) Does not need skilled manual guidance for writing testbenches,
writing design-specific assertions, or debugging spurious counter-examples.
Using open-source RISC-V cores, we demonstrate the following: 1. Quick (<5
minutes for an in-order scalar core and <2.5 hours for an out-of-order
superscalar core) detection of 100% of hundreds of logic bug and hardware
Trojan scenarios from commercial chips and research literature, and 97.9% of
""extremal"" bugs (randomly-generated bugs requiring ~100,000 activation
instructions taken from random test programs). 2. Quick (~1 minute) detection
of several previously unknown bugs in open-source RISC-V designs.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.SE cs.AI cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Test automation brings the potential to reduce costs and human effort, but
several aspects of software testing remain challenging to automate. One such
example is automated performance testing to find performance breaking points.
Current approaches to tackle automated generation of performance test cases
mainly involve using source code or system model analysis or use-case based
techniques. However, source code and system models might not always be
available at testing time. On the other hand, if the optimal performance
testing policy for the intended objective in a testing process instead could be
learned by the testing system, then test automation without advanced
performance models could be possible. Furthermore, the learned policy could
later be reused for similar software systems under test, thus leading to higher
test efficiency. We propose SaFReL, a self-adaptive fuzzy reinforcement
learning-based performance testing framework. SaFReL learns the optimal policy
to generate performance test cases through an initial learning phase, then
reuses it during a transfer learning phase, while keeping the learning running
and updating the policy in the long term. Through multiple experiments on a
simulated environment, we demonstrate that our approach generates the target
performance test cases for different programs more efficiently than a typical
testing process, and performs adaptively without access to source code and
performance models.

is influenced by metallicity: Na/O and Mg/Al anti-correlations are more
extended in metal-poor than in metal-rich clusters. Massive clusters are more
complex systems than the smaller ones, with several populations characterized
by different chemical compositions. The high Li abundance observed in the
intermediate second generation stars strongly favours intermediate mass AGB

However, to fit this paradigm, 3D imaging tasks in the most prominent imaging
modalities (e.g., CT and MRI) have to be reformulated and solved in 2D, losing
rich 3D anatomical information and inevitably compromising the performance. To
overcome this limitation, we have built a set of models, called Generic
Autodidactic Models, nicknamed Models Genesis, because they are created ex
nihilo (with no manual labeling), self-taught (learned by self-supervision),
and generic (served as source models for generating application-specific target
models). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our Models Genesis
significantly outperform learning from scratch in all five target 3D
applications covering both segmentation and classification. More importantly,
learning a model from scratch simply in 3D may not necessarily yield
performance better than transfer learning from ImageNet in 2D, but our Models
Genesis consistently top any 2D approaches including fine-tuning the models
pre-trained from ImageNet as well as fine-tuning the 2D versions of our Models
Genesis, confirming the importance of 3D anatomical information and
significance of our Models Genesis for 3D medical imaging. This performance is
attributed to our unified self-supervised learning framework, built on a simple

this paper, we carry out time-dependent self-consistent fully general
relativistic 1D PIC simulations of the gap, including full inverse Compton
scattering and photon tracking. Similar to the previous paper, we find a highly
time-dependent solution where a macroscopic vacuum gap can open
quasi-periodically, producing bursts of $e^\pm$ pairs and high energy
radiation. We present the light curve, particle and photon spectra from this
process. Using an empirical scaling relation, we rescale the parameters to the
inferred values at the base of the jet in M87, and find that the observed TeV
flares could potentially be explained by this model under certain parameter
assumptions.

technology that is expected to have far-reaching socioeconomic, environmental,

need for validation of 3D designs grows. In order to create a marketplace in
which 3D designs are traded, it is necessary to develop a platform that enables
the attestation of the 3D designs and promotes truthfulness. In this paper, we
introduce a novel concept of a distributed marketplace that will support the
attestation of 3D printing designs. We build a mathematical trust model that
ensures truthfulness among rational, selfish, and independent agents, which is
based on a reward/penalty system. The payment for participating in the
evaluation is calculated by factoring in agents' reputation and peer feedback.
Moreover, we describe the architecture and the implementation of the trust
model on blockchain using smart contracts for the creation of a distributed
marketplace. Our model relies both on theoretical and practical best practices
to create an unique platform that elicit effort and truthfulness from the
participants.

  Spectral Unmixing",,,"10.1109/TIP.2020.2978342",,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Introducing spatial prior information in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis
has led to an overall improvement of the performance of many HSI methods
applied for denoising, classification, and unmixing. Extending such
methodologies to nonlinear settings is not always straightforward, specially
for unmixing problems where the consideration of spatial relationships between
neighboring pixels might comprise intricate interactions between their
fractional abundances and nonlinear contributions. In this paper, we consider a
multiscale regularization strategy for nonlinear spectral unmixing with
kernels. The proposed methodology splits the unmixing problem into two
sub-problems at two different spatial scales: a coarse scale containing
low-dimensional structures, and the original fine scale. The coarse spatial
domain is defined using superpixels that result from a multiscale
transformation. Spectral unmixing is then formulated as the solution of
quadratically constrained optimization problems, which are solved efficiently
by exploring their strong duality and a reformulation of their dual cost
functions in the form of root-finding problems. Furthermore, we employ a
theory-based statistical framework to devise a consistent strategy to estimate
all required parameters, including both the regularization parameters of the
algorithm and the number of superpixels of the transformation, resulting in a
truly blind (from the parameters setting perspective) unmixing method.
Experimental results attest the superior performance of the proposed method
when comparing with other, state-of-the-art, related strategies.

($\mathit{PMI}$) weighting of the cooccurrence matrix performs far better than
raw counts. There is, however, an issue with unobserved pair cooccurrences as
$\mathit{PMI}$ goes to negative infinity. This problem is aggravated by
unreliable statistics from finite corpora which lead to a large number of such
pairs. A common practice is to clip negative $\mathit{PMI}$
($\mathit{\texttt{-} PMI}$) at $0$, also known as Positive $\mathit{PMI}$
($\mathit{PPMI}$). In this paper, we investigate alternative ways of dealing
with $\mathit{\texttt{-} PMI}$ and, more importantly, study the role that
negative information plays in the performance of a low-rank, weighted
factorization of different $\mathit{PMI}$ matrices. Using various semantic and
syntactic tasks as probes into models which use either negative or positive
$\mathit{PMI}$ (or both), we find that most of the encoded semantics and syntax
come from positive $\mathit{PMI}$, in contrast to $\mathit{\texttt{-} PMI}$

observable is a fundamental task in quantum computation. It is often impossible
to obtain such estimates directly, as the computer is restricted to measuring
in a fixed computational basis. One common solution splits the operator into a
weighted sum of Pauli operators and measures each separately, at the cost of
many measurements. An improved version collects mutually commuting Pauli
operators together before measuring all operators within a collection
simultaneously. The effectiveness of doing this depends on two factors.
Firstly, we must understand the improvement offered by a given arrangement of
Paulis in collections. In our work, we propose two natural metrics for
quantifying this, operating under the assumption that measurements are
distributed optimally among collections so as to minimise the overall finite
sampling error. Motivated by the mathematical form of these metrics, we
introduce SORTED INSERTION, a collecting strategy that exploits the weighting
of each Pauli operator in the overall sum. Secondly, to measure all Pauli
operators within a collection simultaneously, a circuit is required to rotate
them to the computational basis. In our work, we present two efficient circuit
constructions that suitably rotate any collection of $k$ independent commuting
$n$-qubit Pauli operators using at most $kn-k(k+1)/2$ and $O(kn/\log k)$
two-qubit gates respectively. Our methods are numerically illustrated in the
context of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, where the operators in question
are molecular Hamiltonians. As measured by our metrics, SORTED INSERTION
outperforms four conventional greedy colouring algorithms that seek the minimum
number of collections.

localization that allows for, e.g., an effective characterization of physical
bonds in molecular and solid state systems. In the context of the widely used
Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (KS-DFT) and its generalizations, ELF is
given in terms of the single-particle electron density as well as the
non-interacting kinetic energy density (KED) of the KS system. Starting from
the notion of an edge electron gas put forth by Kohn and Mattsson, we here use
an \emph{exactly soluble}, strongly correlated few-electron model of a
harmonically confined electron gas in order to parameterize the
positive-definite non-interacting KS KED in terms of the density and its
reduced second-order gradients. We arrive at a simple, yet generally applicable
functional approximation to ELF expressed in the electron density and its
derivatives. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we use the obtained
parameterization to perform topological analysis of the bonds in solid Al and
Si, and to study physical and chemical adsorption of graphene on a Ni surface.
We find that while the expression does not provide a quantitatively accurate
approximation of absolute ELF values, the most essential qualitative features
are captured. Hence, the expression is useful in contexts where the electron
density is available, but not the KS orbitals or the KED, and one desires a
qualitative picture of the electron localization that mimics ELF.

curvature perturbation is able to vigorously interact with an ultra-light
isocurvature field -- a massless fluctuation orthogonal to the background
inflationary trajectory in field space. We identify a class of inflationary
models where ultra-light fields can emerge as a consequence of an underlying
""scaling transformation"" that rescales the entire system's action and keeps the
classical equations of motion invariant. This scaling invariance ensures the
existence of an ultra-light fluctuation that freezes after horizon crossing. If
the inflationary trajectory is misaligned with respect to the scaling symmetry
direction, then the isocurvature field is proportional to this ultra-light
field, and becomes massless. In addition, we find that even if the isocurvature
field interacts strongly with the curvature perturbation --transferring its own
statistics to the curvature perturbation-- it is unable to induce large
non-Gaussianity. The reason is simply that the same mechanism ensuring a
suppressed mass for the isocurvature field is also responsible for suppressing
its self-interactions. As a result, in models with light isocurvature fields
the bispectrum is generally expected to be slow-roll suppressed, but with a
squeezed limit that differs from Maldacena's consistency relation.

the communication efficiency of retrieving a sequence of desired matrix
products ${\bf AB}$ $=$ $({\bf A}_1{\bf B}_1,$ ${\bf A}_2{\bf B}_2,$ $\cdots,$

matrices ${\bf A}=({\bf A}_1, {\bf A}_2, \cdots, {\bf A}_S)$ and ${\bf B}=({\bf

of an SDBMM scheme is defined as the ratio of the number of bits of desired
information that is retrieved, to the total number of bits downloaded on
average. The supremum of achievable rates is called the capacity of SDBMM. In
this work we explore the capacity of SDBMM, as well as several of its variants,
e.g., where the user may already have either ${\bf A}$ or ${\bf B}$ available
as side-information, and/or where the security constraint for either ${\bf A}$

schemes for various cases of SDBMM, depending on the $L, K, M, N, X$

remarkable aspect of our upper bounds is a connection between SDBMM and a form
of private information retrieval (PIR) problem, known as multi-message
$X$-secure $T$-private information retrieval (MM-XSTPIR). Notable features of
our achievable schemes include the use of cross-subspace alignment and a
transformation argument that converts a scalar multiplication problem into a
scalar addition problem, allowing a surprisingly efficient solution.

identified in dense star clusters remains sparse. Previous analyses have
suggested this may be due in part to dynamical interactions that unbind large
fractions of planets from their host stars, limiting the survival of planetary
systems in clusters. Thus, alternative detection strategies may be necessary to
study planets in clusters that may no longer be bound to a host star. Here, we
use the cluster Monte Carlo code CMC to explore the evolution of planetary
systems in dense star clusters. Depending on a number of initial conditions, we
show that $10-50\%$ of primordial planetary systems are broken through
dynamical encounters over a cluster's full lifetime, populating clusters with
""free-floating"" planets. Furthermore, a large number ($30-80\%$) of planets are
ejected from their host cluster through strong dynamical encounters and/or
tidal loss. Additionally, we show that planets naturally mix with stellar-mass
black holes (BHs) in the central regions of their host cluster. As a
consequence, up to a few hundreds of planets will be tidally disrupted through
close passages of BHs. We show these BH-planet tidal disruption events (TDEs)
occur in clusters at a rate of up to $10^{-5}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in a Milky
Way-type galaxy. We predict BH-planet TDEs should be detected by upcoming
transient surveys such as LSST at a rate of roughly a few events per year. The
observed rate of BH-planet TDEs would place new constraints upon the formation
and survival of both planetary systems and BHs in dense star clusters.
Additionally, depending on various assumptions including the initial number of
planets and their orbital properties, we predict that typical globular clusters
may contain a few dynamically-formed NS-planet systems at present as well as up
to roughly 100 dynamically-formed WD-planet systems.

We point out that introducing a long-range force between a millicharged
subcomponent of dark matter and the dominant cold dark matter (CDM) component
leads to efficient cooling of baryons in the early universe, while also
significantly extending the range of viable mDM masses. Such a scenario can
explain the anomalous absorption signal in the sky-averaged 21-cm spectrum
observed by EDGES, and leads to a number of testable predictions for the
properties of the dark sector. The mDM mass can then lie between 10 MeV and a
few hundreds of GeVs, and its scattering cross section with baryons lies within
an unconstrained window of parameter space above direct detection limits and
below current bounds from colliders. In this allowed region, mDM can make up as
little as $10^{-8}$ of the total dark matter energy density. The CDM mass
ranges from 10 MeV to a few GeVs, and has an interaction cross section with the
Standard Model that is induced by a loop of mDM particles. This cross section

only $3.45\,\times 10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, and hence $5.2\,{\rm M}_\oplus$ of
rock is required to obtain the observed 0.128 dex metal enhancement. Rocky
planets dissolve entirely in the convective envelope if they enter it with
sufficiently tangential orbits: we find that the critical condition for
dissolution is that the planet's radial speed must be less than 40% of its
total velocity at the stellar surface; or, equivalently, the impact parameter
must be greater than about 0.9. We model the delivery of rocky planets to the
stellar surface both by planet-planet scattering in a realistic multi-planet
system, and by Lidov-Kozai cycles driven by a more massive planetary or stellar
companion. In both cases almost all planets that are ingested arrive at the
star on grazing orbits and hence will dissolve in the surface convection zone.
We conclude that super-Earth ingestion is a good explanation for the metal
enhancement in M67 Y2235, and that a high-resolution spectroscopic survey of
stellar abundances around the turn-off and main sequence of M67 has the
potential to constrain the frequency of late-time dynamical instability in

stellar envelope, the first photons, typically in the X-ray to UV range, escape
to the observer. Following this breakout emission, radiation from deeper shells
diffuses out of the envelope as the supernova ejecta expands. Previous studies
have shown that the radiation throughout the planar phase (i.e., before the
expanding envelope has doubled its radius) originates in the same mass
coordinate, called the `breakout shell'. We derive a self-similar solution for
the radiation inside the envelope, and show that this claim is incorrect, and
that the diffusion wave propagates logarithmically into the envelope (in
Lagrangian sense) rather than remaining at a fixed mass coordinate. The
logarithmic correction implies that the luminosity originates in regions where
the density is $\sim 10$ times higher than previously thought, where the photon
production rate is increased and helps thermalization. We show that this result
has significant implications on the observed temperature. In our model, the
radiation emitted from blue supergiant and Wolf-Rayet explosions is still
expected to be out of thermal equilibrium during the entire planar phase, but
the observed temperature will decrease by two orders of magnitude, contrary to
previous estimates. Considering the conditions at the end of the planar phase,

accretion of grains whose aerodynamic properties make them marginally coupled

pebble accretion can ameliorate some of the issues presented by growth by
purely gravitational processes, it has other issues when compared with
observations of exoplanetary systems. A particular concern is the preponderance
of planets that end their growth as ""super-Earths"" or ""sub-Neptunes"", with
masses in the range 2-10 $M_\oplus$. Once planets reach this mass scale,
timescales for growth by pebble accretion are so rapid that ubiquitously ending
growth here is difficult. In this work, we highlight this issue in detail using
our previously published model of pebble accretion, and also propose a possible
solution: feedback between the growing planet's atmosphere and the gas disk
inhibits accretion of smaller particle sizes by forcing them to flow around the
growing planet instead of being accreted. For reasonable fiducial disk
parameters this ""flow isolation"" will inhibit accretion of all available
particle sizes once the planet reaches super-Earth masses. We also demonstrate

entanglement density of the initial state. As the entanglement density varies
from zero to one, the information speed varies from the entanglement speed to
the butterfly speed. We verify that the formula holds both for a quantum

field ('early dark energy', EDE) in the context of resolving the Hubble
tension. Consistent with earlier work, but without relying on fluid
approximations, we find that a scalar field frozen due to Hubble friction until
${\rm log}_{10}(z_c)\sim3.5$, reaching $\rho_{\rm EDE}(z_c)/\rho_{\rm
tot}\sim10$%, and diluting faster than matter afterwards can bring cosmic
microwave background (CMB), baryonic acoustic oscillations, supernovae
luminosity distances, and the late-time estimate of the Hubble constant from
the SH0ES collaboration into agreement. A scalar field potential which scales
as $V(\phi) \propto \phi^{2n}$ with $2\lesssim n\lesssim 3.4$ around the
minimum is preferred at the 68% confidence level, and the {\em Planck}
polarization places additional constraints on the dynamics of perturbations in
the scalar field. In particular, the data prefers a potential which flattens at
large field displacements. An MCMC analysis of mock data shows that the
next-generation CMB observations (i.e., CMB-S4) can unambiguously detect the
presence of the EDE at very high significance. This projected sensitivity to
the EDE dynamics is mainly driven by improved measurements of the $E$-mode
polarization.
  We also explore new observational signatures of EDE scalar field dynamics:
(i) We find that depending on the strength of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the
presence of the EDE might imply the existence of isocurvature perturbations in
the CMB. (ii) We show that a strikingly rapid, scale-dependent growth of EDE
field perturbations can result from parametric resonance driven by the
anharmonic oscillating field for $n\approx 2$. This instability and ensuing
potentially nonlinear, spatially inhomogenoues, dynamics may provide unique
signatures of this scenario.

spacetimes based on loop quantum gravity. While it has been successful in
resolution of various cosmological singularities and connecting Planck scale
physics to phenomenology, its connection with loop quantum gravity has remained
elusive. It is therefore important to integrate more and more features of the
full theory into this framework and understand the reliability of physical
predictions. In particular, if one wishes to connect the effective Hamiltonian
in loop quantum cosmology to an expectation value of the scalar constraint
operator in suitable coherent states for the full theory, one has to go beyond
the standard setting of loop quantum cosmology. One possibility is to introduce
gauge-covariant fluxes, which become necessary because the presence of a finite
regularization parameter causes functions build out of the standard discretized
variables to be in general not gauge invariant. Following the construction of
gauge-covariant fluxes pioneered by Thiemann in [1], we show that the physics
of loop quantum cosmology is affected in a non-trivial way. The bounce turns
out to be generically asymmetric with a rescaling of the Newton's constant in
the pre-bounce branch. Gauge-covariant fluxes result in a higher order quantum
difference equation in comparison to loop quantum cosmology. Even the behavior
of matter, which behaves innocuously in loop quantum cosmology, is enriched,
resulting in an effective non-minimal coupling. These effects are shown to be
common to different choices of regularization parameters.

into quantum matter and of technological exploitation in the increasingly
applied field of spintronics. In this context, the magnetic thermal transport
is a particularly sensitive probe of the elementary spin and exotic topological
excitations in unconventional magnetic insulators. However, magnetic
contributions to heat conduction are invariably intertwined with lattice
contributions, and thus the issue of spin-phonon coupling in determining the
spin and thermal transport properties becomes more important with emergent
topological magnetic system. Here we report the observation of an anomalously
strong enhancement of the thermal conductivity, occurring at all relevant
temperatures, in the layered honeycomb material CrCl$_3$ in the presence of an
applied magnetic field. Away from the magnetically ordered phase at low
temperatures and small fields, there is no coherent spin contribution to the
heat conduction, and hence the effect must be caused by a strong suppression of
the phonon thermal conductivity due to magnetic fluctuations, which are in turn
suppressed by the field. We build an empirical model for the thermal
conductivity of CrCl$_3$ within a formalism assuming an independently
determined number of spin-flip processes and an efficiency of the phonon
scattering events they mediate. By extracting the intrinsic phonon thermal
conductivity we obtain a quantitative description at all fields and
temperatures and demonstrate that the scattering efficiency is entirely
independent of the field. In this way we use CrCl$_3$ as a model system to
understand the interactions between spin and phonon excitations in the context
of thermal transport. We anticipate that the completely general framework we
introduce will have broad implications for the interpretation of transport
phenomena in magnetic quantum materials.

4,000 synonym sets (synsets), containing 9,000 English words, from 1800 AD to
2000 AD. We present a supervised learning algorithm that is able to predict the
future leader of a synset: the word in the synset that will have the highest
frequency. The algorithm uses features based on a word's length, the characters
in the word, and the historical frequencies of the word. It can predict change
of leadership (including the identity of the new leader) fifty years in the
future, with an F-score considerably above random guessing. Analysis of the
learned models provides insight into the causes of change in the leader of a
synset. The algorithm confirms observations linguists have made, such as the
trend to replace the -ise suffix with -ize, the rivalry between the -ity and
-ness suffixes, and the struggle between economy (shorter words are easier to
remember and to write) and clarity (longer words are more distinctive and less
likely to be confused with one another). The results indicate that integration
of the Google Books Ngram Corpus with WordNet has significant potential for
improving our understanding of how language evolves.

topological lens. The images we focus on here are those that have been
segmented by digital Jordan curves as a means of image compression. The
algorithms of interest are those that continuously morph one digital image into
another digital image. Digital Jordan curves have been studied in a variety of
forms for decades now. Our contribution to this field is interpreting the set
of digital Jordan curves that can exist within a given digital plane as a
finite topological space. Computing the topological complexity of this space
determines the minimal number of continuous motion planning rules required to
transform one image into another, and determining the motion planners
associated to topological complexity provides the specific algorithms for doing
so. The main result of Section 3 is that our space of digital Jordan curves is
connected, hence, its topological complexity is finite. To build up to that, we
use Section 2 to prove some results about paths and distance functions that are
obvious in Hausdorff spaces, yet surprisingly elusive in $T_0$ spaces. We end
with Section 4, in which we study applications of these results. In particular,
we prove that our interpretation of the space of digital Jordan curves is the
only topologically correct interpretation. This article is an adaptation of the
author's Ph.D. dissertation.

signals are much longer than the cavity field lifetime. In view of atomic
relaxation and other imperfections, there may arise a need to speed-up the
light-atoms interface operation. By increasing the cavity field lifetime, one
can achieve better light-matter coupling and entanglement. In our work, we
consider the non-adiabatic effects that become important beyond the bad cavity
limit in both low-photon and continuous variables regime. We find classical
control field time profiles that allow one to retrieve from the cavity an
output quantized signal of a predefined time shape and duration, which is
optimal for the homodyne detection, optical mixing or further manipulation.
This is done for a wide range of the signal duration as compared to the cavity
field lifetime. We discuss an optimal cavity-atomic ensemble matching in terms
of the cavity field lifetime which allows one to apply less intense control
field and to minimize a variety of non-linear effects, such as AC light shifts,
four-wave mixing, etc, which may be potentially harmful to an experiment.

obtainment of a quantitative description of the growth of such temperatures
with the number of layers, N, which accurately applies to the $Bi$, $Hg$ and

transition temperatures, obtaining excellent agreement with the experimental
data for different materials and dopings. These results are obtained from an
effective Hamiltonian for the itinerant oxygen holes, which includes both the
electric repulsion between them and their magnetic interactions with the
localized copper ions. We show that the former interaction is responsible for
the SC and the latter, for the PG phases, the phase diagram of cuprates
resulting from the competition of both. The Hamiltonian is defined on a
bipartite oxygen lattice, which results from the fact that only the $p_x$ and

implemented as operations that are external to the Immigration Game. Because
these operations are external to the game, we are able to freely manipulate the

composed of four layers, each layer building on the previous layer. The first
layer implements a simple form of asexual reproduction, the second layer
introduces a more sophisticated form of asexual reproduction, the third layer
adds sexual reproduction, and the fourth layer adds symbiosis. The experiments
show that a small amount of symbiosis, added to the other layers, significantly
increases the fitness of the population. We suggest that the model may provide
new insights into symbiosis in biological and cultural evolution.

supervised machine learning classification algorithms: $k$-nearest neighbors

perceptron (MLP) neural network. For input features, we use properties that can
be measured from optical galaxy spectra out to $z < 0.8$---[OIII]/H$\beta$,
[OII]/H$\beta$, [OIII] line width, and stellar velocity dispersion---and four
colors ($u-g$, $g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$) corrected to $z=0.1$. The labels for
the low redshift emission line galaxy training set are determined using
standard optical diagnostic diagrams. RF has the best area under curve (AUC)
score for classifying all four galaxy types, meaning highest distinguishing
power. Both the AUC scores and accuracies of the other algorithms are ordered

issue in computational cancer biology. In this paper, we propose a general
mathematical model framework for the evolutionary dynamics of cancer with
plasticity and heterogeneity in cancer cells. Cancer is a group of diseases
involving abnormal cell growth, during which abnormal regulations in stem cell
regeneration are essential for the dynamics of cancer development. In general,
the dynamics of stem cell regeneration can be simplified as a $\mathrm{G_0}$
phase cell cycle model, which lead to a delay differentiation equation. When
cell heterogeneity and plasticity are considered, we establish a
differential-integral equation based on the random transition of epigenetic
states of stem cells during cell division. The proposed model highlights cell
heterogeneity and plasticity, and connects the heterogeneity with cell-to-cell
variance in cellular behaviors, e.g. proliferation, apoptosis, and
differentiation/senescence, and can be extended to include gene
mutation-induced tumor development. Hybrid computations models are developed
based on the mathematical model framework, and are applied to the process of
inflammation-induced tumorigenesis and tumor relapse after CAR-T therapy.
Finally, we give rise to several mathematical problems related to the proposed
differential-integral equation. Answers to these problems are crucial for the
understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of cancer.

sparsening algorithm for forming correlation functions describing multi-hadron

constructs correlation functions from sparsened propagators defined on a
coarsened lattice geometry, where the sparsened propagators are obtained from
propagators computed on the full lattice. This algorithm is used to study the
low-energy QCD ground-state spectrum using a single Wilson-clover lattice
ensemble with $m_{\pi} \approx 800$ MeV. It is found that the extracted ground
state masses and binding energies, as well as their statistical uncertainties,
are consistent when determined from correlation functions constructed from
sparsened and full propagators. In addition, while evidence of modified
couplings to excited states is observed in sparsened correlation functions, it
is demonstrated that these effects can be removed, if desired, with an
inexpensive modification to the sparsened estimator.

the real K\""ahler function denoted by $G(T_i, \bar {T}_i) = K + \log |W|^2$,
where K is a real K\""ahler potential, and W is a holomorphic superpotential. A
field redefinition $T_i \rightarrow f_1(T_i)$ does not change neither the
theory, nor the K\""ahler geometry. Similarly, the K\""ahler transformation, $K
\rightarrow K + f_2 + \bar f_2, W \rightarrow e^{-f_2} W$ where $f_2$ is
holomorphic also leaves G and hence the theory and the geometry invariant.
However, if we perform a field redefinition only in $K(T_i,\bar{T}_i)
\rightarrow K(f(T_i),f(\bar{T}_i))$, while keeping the same superpotential
$W(T_i)$, we get a different theory, as G is not invariant under such a

construction generalizes previous ones that were limited by the holomorphic
property of $W$. In particular it allows for novel inflationary SUGRA models

correspond to different choices of field redefinitions. We demonstrate this
possibility by constructing several prototypes of inflationary models (hilltop,

accord with current observations and predict $r\in[10^{-6},0.06]$ spanning

fluctuations on slow time scales of centuries and millennia. Plausible physical
explanations for the cause of these long-term variations of the solar cycle are
still elusive, with possible theories including stochasticity of alpha effect
and fluctuations of the differential rotation. It has been suggested recently
in the literature that there exists a possible relation between the
spatio-temporal structure of Solar cycle and the nonlinear dynamics of
magnetohydrodynamic Rossby waves at the solar tachocline, including both
wave-wave and wave-mean flow interactions. Here we extend the nonlinear theory
of MHD Rossby waves presented in a previous article to take into account long
term modulation effects due to a recently discovered mechanism that allows
significant energy transfers throughout different wave triads: the precession
resonance mechanism. We have found a large number of Rossby-Haurwitz wave
triads whose frequency mismatches are compatible with the solar cycle
frequency. Consequently, by analyzing the reduced dynamics of two triads
coupled by a single mode (five-wave system), we have demonstrated that in the
amplitude regime in which precession resonance occurs, the energy transfer
throughout the system yields significant long-term modulations on the main
$\sim 11$yr period associated with intra-triad energy exchanges. We further
show that such modulations display an inverse relationship between the
characteristic wave amplitude and the period of intra-triad energy exchanges,
which is consistent with the Waldmeier's law for the solar cycle. In the
presence of a constant forcing and dissipation, the five-wave system in the
precession resonance regime exhibits irregular amplitude fluctuations with some
periods resembling the Grand Minimum states.

gas regions of proto-cluster galaxies by extracting fluxes from emission lines
H$\beta$ 4861\AA, [OIII] 5007\AA, H$\alpha$ 6563\AA, [NII] 6585\AA, and [SII]
6716,6731\AA. We measure gas-phase metallicity of members in both
proto-clusters using two indicators, including a strong-line indicator
relatively independent of ionization parameter and electron density.
Proto-cluster and field galaxies in both UDS and COSMOS lie on the same
Mass-Metallicity Relation with both metallicity indicators. We compare our
results to recent IllustrisTNG results, which reports no significant gas-phase
metallicity offset between proto-cluster and field galaxies until z=1.5. This
is in agreement with our observed metallicities, where no offset is measured
between proto-cluster and field populations. We measure tentative evidence from
stacked spectra that UDS high mass proto-cluster and field galaxies have
differing [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratios, however these results are dependent on the
sample size of the high mass stacks.

threshold graphs in the many node regime. This analysis is carried out under a
weak assumption on the distribution of the underlying fitness variable. This
assumption, which is satisfied by the exponential distribution, determines a
natural scaling under which the following limiting results are shown: The nodal
degree distribution, i.e., the distribution of any node, converges in
distribution to a limiting pmf. However, for each $d=0,1, \ldots $, the
fraction of nodes with given degree $d$ converges only in distribution to a
non-degenerate random variable $\Pi(d)$ (whose distribution depends on $d$),and
not in probability to the aforementioned limiting nodal pmf as is customarily
expected. The distribution of $\Pi(d)$ is identified only through its
characteristic function. Implications of this result include: (i) The empirical
node distribution may not be used as a proxy for or as an estimate to the
limiting nodal pmf; (ii) Even in homogeneous graphs, the network-wide degree
distribution and the nodal degree distribution may capture vastly different
information; and (iii) Random threshold graphs with exponential distributed

stability of the quasi-equilibria - that is, the simplest short-wavelength
patterns fully imposed by the external signal. Comparing the results to the
case of switching the signal off allows us to estimate the effect of it. For
instance, the effect of the travelling wave turns out to be not single-valued
but depending on the wave speed. Namely, there is an independent threshold
value such that increasing the amplitude of the wave destabilizes the
quasi-equilibria provided that the wave speed is above this value. Otherwise,
the same action exerts the opposite effect. It is worth to note that the effect
is exponential in the amplitude of the wave in both cases.

behavior of the resulting excited state potential energy surfaces beyond the
Coulson-Fisher (CF) point in single bond dissociations, when the optimal
reference determinant is spin-polarized. Many excited states exhibit sharp
kinks at the CF point, and connect to different dissociation limits via a zone
of unphysical concave curvature. In particular, the unrestricted M$_S=0$ lowest
triplet T$_1$ state changes character, and does not dissociate into ground
state fragments. The unrestricted $M_S=\pm 1$ T$_1$ CIS states better
approximate the physical dissociation limit, but their degeneracy is broken
beyond the CF point for most single bond dissociations. On the other hand, the
$M_S=\pm 1$ T$_1$ TDHF states reach the asymptote too soon, by merging with the
ground state from the CF point onwards. Use of local exchange-correlation
functionals causes $M_S=\pm 1$ T$_1$ TDDFT states to resemble their unphysical
$M_S= 0$ counterpart. The 2 orbital, 2-electron model system of minimal basis
H$_2$ is analytically treated to understand the origin of these issues,
revealing that the lack of double excitations is at the root of these
remarkable observations. The behavior of excited state surfaces is also

fundamental differences in their behavior. Observational entropy behaves in
accord with classical Boltzmann entropy (e.g. equilibrium is a condition of
near-maximal entropy and uniformly distributed particles, and minimal entropy
is a very compact configuration). Entanglement entropy is rather different:
minimal entropy ""empties out"" one partition while maximal entropy apportions
the particles between the partitions, and neither is typical. Beyond these
qualitative results, we characterize both entropies and their fluctuations in
some detail as they depend on temperature, particle number, and box size.

exploits a simple deep neural network that can efficiently handle unordered

output is a vector consisting of both the box pose (position and orientation in
LiDAR coordinate system) and its size (width and length). In order to deal with
the angle discontinuity problem, we propose to estimate the double-angle
sinusoidal values rather than the angle itself. We also predict the center
relative to the point cloud mean to boost the performance of estimating the
location of the box. The proposed method does not rely on the ordering of
points as in many existing approaches, and can accurately predict the actual
size of the bounding box based on the prior information that is obtained from
the training data. BoxNet is validated using the KITTI 3D object dataset, with
significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art non-learning based

distinct views reflect distinct attribute similarities across entities, and
contextual similarity and attribute importance are respected. Secondly, we
propose a novel suspiciousness metric for scoring entity groups given the
abnormality of their synchronicity across multiple views, which obeys intuitive

on modifications to General Relativity (GR) in the extreme gravity regime.
Although these observations were consistent with compact binaries with no
orbital eccentricity, gravitational waves emitted in mildly eccentric binaries
may be observed once detectors reach their design sensitivity. In this paper,
we study the effect of eccentricity in gravitational wave constraints of
modified gravity, focusing on Jordan-Brans- Dicke-Fierz theory as an example.
Using the stationary phase approximation and the post-circular approximation
(an expansion in small eccentricity), we first construct an analytical
expression for frequency-domain gravitational waveforms produced by inspiraling
compact binaries with small eccentricity in this theory. We then calculate the
overlap between our approximate analytical waveforms and an eccentric numerical
model (TaylorT4) to determine the regime of validity (in eccentricity) of the
former. With this at hand, we carry out a Fisher analysis to determine the
accuracy to which Jordan-Brans-Dicke-Fierz theory could be constrained given
future eccentric detections consistent with General Relativity. We find that
the constraint on the theory initially deteriorates (due to covariances between
the eccentricity and the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter), but then it begins to
recover, once the eccentricity is larger than approximately 0.03. We also find
that third-generation ground-based detectors and space-based detectors could
allow for constraints that are up to an order of magnitude more stringent than
current Solar System bounds. Our results suggest that waveforms in modified
gravity for systems with moderate eccentricity should be developed to maximize
the theoretical physics that can be extracted in the future.

such dynamical systems: First, infinitely large systems on directed graphs can
be stable even when the degree distribution has unbounded support; this result
is surprising since their counterparts on nondirected graphs are unstable when
system size is large enough. Second, we show that the phase transition between
the stable and unstable phase is universal in the sense that it depends only on
a few parameters, such as, the mean degree and a degree correlation
coefficient. In addition, in the unstable regime we characterize the nature of
the destabilizing mode, which also exhibits universal features. These results
follow from an exact theory for the leading eigenvalue of infinitely large

analytical results for infinitely large graphs with numerical experiments on
random graphs of finite size. We discuss how the presented theory can be

probabilistic database is the probability that the CQ is satisfied when the
tuples of the database are sampled one by one, independently, with their
associated probability. For queries without self-joins (repeated relation
symbols), the data complexity of this problem is fully characterized by a known
dichotomy: reliability can be computed in polynomial time for hierarchical
queries, and is #P-hard for non-hierarchical queries.
  Inspired by this dichotomy, we investigate a fundamental counting problem for
CQs without self-joins: how many sets of facts from the input database satisfy
the query? This is equivalent to the uniform case of the query reliability
problem, where the probability of every tuple is required to be 1/2. Of course,
for hierarchical queries, uniform reliability is solvable in polynomial time,
like the reliability problem. We show that being hierarchical is also necessary
for this tractability (under conventional complexity assumptions). In fact, we
establish a generalization of the dichotomy that covers every restricted case
of reliability in which the probabilities of tuples are determined by their
relation.

generation such as text-to-image synthesis. Training these models typically
requires paired data with direct correspondence between modalities. We
introduce the novel problem of translating instances from one modality to
another without paired data by leveraging an intermediate modality shared by
the two other modalities. To demonstrate this, we take the problem of
translating images to speech. In this case, one could leverage disjoint
datasets with one shared modality, e.g., image-text pairs and text-speech
pairs, with text as the shared modality. We call this problem ""skip-modal
generation"" because the shared modality is skipped during the generation
process. We propose a multimodal information bottleneck approach that learns
the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data (image and speech) by
leveraging the shared modality (text). We address fundamental challenges of
skip-modal generation: 1) learning multimodal representations using a single
model, 2) bridging the domain gap between two unrelated datasets, and 3)
learning the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data. We show
qualitative results on image-to-speech synthesis; this is the first time such
results have been reported in the literature. We also show that our approach
improves performance on traditional cross-modal generation, suggesting that it
improves data efficiency in solving individual tasks.

Failing to account for such endogeneity produces overly simplistic theories of

advantage in obstacle-strewn scenarios characterizing urban disaster zones,
subterranean collapses, and other natural environments. The elongated,
laterally-narrow footprint associated with these motion strategies is
well-suited to traversal of confined spaces and narrow pathways. Navigation and
path planning in the absence of global sensing, however, remains a pivotal
challenge to be addressed prior to practical deployment of these robotic
mechanisms. Several challenges related to visual processing and localization
need to be resolved to to enable navigation. As a first pass in this direction,
we equip a wireless, monocular color camera to the head of a robotic snake.
Visiual odometry and mapping from ORB-SLAM permits self-localization in planar,
obstacle-strewn environments. Ground plane traversability segmentation in
conjunction with perception-space collision detection permits path planning for
navigation. A previously presented dynamical reduction of rectilinear snake
locomotion to a non-holonomic kinematic vehicle informs both SLAM and planning.
The simplified motion model is then applied to track planned trajectories
through an obstacle configuration. This navigational framework enables a
snake-like robotic platform to autonomously navigate and traverse unknown
scenarios with only monocular vision.

The route recommendations generated by these services often leads to severe
congestion on urban streets, raising concerns from neighboring residents and
city authorities. This paper is motivated by the question: How can a
transportation authority design an information structure to induce a preferred
equilibrium traffic flow pattern in uncertain network state conditions? We
approach this question from a Bayesian persuasion viewpoint. We consider a
basic routing game with two parallel routes and an uncertain state that affects
the travel cost on one of the routes. The authority sends a noisy signal of the
state to a given fraction of travelers. The information structure (i.e.,
distribution of signals in each state) chosen by the authority creates a
heterogeneous information environment for the routing game. The solution
concept governing the travelers' route choices is Bayesian Wardrop Equilibrium.
We design an information structure to minimize the average traffic spillover --
the amount of equilibrium route flow exceeding a certain threshold -- on one of
the routes. We provide an analytical characterization of the optimal
information structure for any fraction of travelers receiving the signal. We
find that it can achieve the minimum spillover so long as the fraction of
travelers receiving the signal is larger than a threshold (smaller than 1).

may be a desire to have robust power under different deviations from

cross-pharma working group has proposed a combination test to provide robust
power under a variety of alternative hypotheses. These can be specified for
primary analysis at the design stage and methods appropriately accounting for

crucial. We formulate the energy consumption of UAVs as an aggregate of
communication/caching, hovering, and vertical displacement energies, and then
devise an optimization problem for optimally assigning contents to caches and
choosing the height of UAVs. Adopting tools from stochastic geometry, we also
derive the EE in a numerically tractable form as a function of density, the
radius of the cooperation zone, cache size, main communication/physical
characteristics of UAVs, and influential environmental parameters. We develop
two content placement strategies with low computational complexity. The
conducted numerical results demonstrate that by adopting these algorithms one
is able to improve EE by up to 800% compared to common content placement
schemes, e.g., the least-frequently used (LRU), the most-popular, and Hit-rate.
Furthermore, while under LRU and Hit-rate schemes there is no benefit in
vertically displacing UAVs, under our algorithms one is able to increase EE by
at most 600%. Importantly, via our algorithms one can increase the size of

optimal values for density and cache-size of UAVs, granting maximum EE.

uncovered the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial
perturbations, creating concerns on model generalizability and new threats such
as prediction-evasive misclassification or stealthy reprogramming. Among
different defense proposals, stochastic network defenses such as random neuron
activation pruning or random perturbation to layer inputs are shown to be
promising for attack mitigation. However, one critical drawback of current
defenses is that the robustness enhancement is at the cost of noticeable
performance degradation on legitimate data, e.g., large drop in test accuracy.
This paper is motivated by pursuing for a better trade-off between adversarial
robustness and test accuracy for stochastic network defenses. We propose
Defense Efficiency Score (DES), a comprehensive metric that measures the gain
in unsuccessful attack attempts at the cost of drop in test accuracy of any
defense. To achieve a better DES, we propose hierarchical random switching
(HRS), which protects neural networks through a novel randomization scheme. A
HRS-protected model contains several blocks of randomly switching channels to
prevent adversaries from exploiting fixed model structures and parameters for
their malicious purposes. Extensive experiments show that HRS is superior in
defending against state-of-the-art white-box and adaptive adversarial
misclassification attacks. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HRS in
defending adversarial reprogramming, which is the first defense against
adversarial programs. Moreover, in most settings the average DES of HRS is at
least 5X higher than current stochastic network defenses, validating its
significantly improved robustness-accuracy trade-off.

train a customized student network that tackles a set of selective tasks

teacher may be either single- or multi-task. To this end, we introduce a
dual-step strategy that first extracts the task-specific knowledge from the
heterogeneous teachers sharing the same sub-task, and then amalgamates the
extracted knowledge to build the student network. To facilitate the training,
we employ a selective learning scheme where, for each unlabelled sample, the
student learns adaptively from only the teacher with the least prediction
ambiguity. We evaluate the proposed approach on several datasets and
experimental results demonstrate that the student, learned by such adaptive
knowledge amalgamation, achieves performances even better than those of the
teachers.

of videos that are mainly recommended among themselves. This is indicative of
the links between video recommendation and the inequality of attention

variables of leaky FSMs with MHD simulations, we forward-model the intensity
and spectral properties of the Fe X 185~\AA~and Fe XII 195~\AA~lines by
incorporating non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) in the computations of the
relevant ionic fractions. The damping times derived from the intensity
variations are then compared with the wave values, namely the damping times
directly found from our MHD simulations. Our results show that in the
equilibrium ionization cases, the density variations and the intensity
variations can be either in phase or in anti-phase, depending on the loop
temperature. NEI considerably impacts the intensity variations but has only
marginal effects on the derived Doppler velocity or Doppler width. We find that
the damping time derived from the intensity can largely reflect the wave
damping time if the loop temperature is not drastically different from the
nominal formation temperature of the corresponding emission line. These results
are helpful for understanding the modulations to the EUV emissions by leaky
FSMs and hence helpful for identifying FSMs in solar active region loops.

2) the properties of text including variants of fonts, languages, orientations,

hard X-ray emission in resolved quasar jets has been inverse Compton
upscattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background (IC/CMB), which requires jets
which remain highly relativistic on 10-1000 kpc scales. In more recent years
various lines of observational evidence, including gamma-ray upper limits, have
disfavored this explanation in favor of a synchrotron origin. While the IC/CMB
model generally predicts a high level of gamma-ray emission, it has never been
detected. Here we report the detection of a low-state Fermi/LAT gamma-ray
spectrum associated with two jetted AGN which is consistent with the
predictions of the IC/CMB model for their X-ray emission. We have used archival
multiwavelength observations to make precise predictions for the expected
minimum flux in the GeV band, assuming that the X-ray emission from the
kpc-scale jet is entirely due to the IC/CMB process. In both sources -- OJ 287
and PKS 1510-089 -- the minimum-detected gamma-ray flux level agrees with
predictions. Both sources exhibit extreme superluminal proper motions relative
to their jet power, which argues for the well-aligned jets required by the
IC/CMB model. In the case of PKS~1510-089, it cannot be ruled out that the
minimum gamma-ray flux level is due to a low state of the variable core which
only matches the IC/CMB prediction by chance. Continued long-term monitoring
with the Fermi/LAT could settle this issue by detecting a plateau signature in
the recombined light-curve which would clearly signal the presence of a
non-variable emission component.

protoplanetary disks. An important parameter to measure in disks is the maximum
dust grain size present. This is usually estimated through measurements of the
dust opacity at different millimeter wavelengths assuming optically thin
emission and dust opacity dominated by absorption. However, ALMA observations
have shown that these assumptions might not be correct in the case of
protoplanetary disks, leading to overestimation of particle sizes and to
underestimation of the disk's mass. Here, we present an analysis of high
quality ALMA and VLA images of the HL Tau protoplanetary disk, covering a wide
range of wavelengths, from 0.8 mm to 1 cm, and with a physical resolution of
$\sim$7.35 au. We describe a procedure to analyze a set of millimeter images
without any assumption about the optical depth of the emission, and including
the effects of absorption and scattering in the dust opacity. This procedure

differences in the dust properties between dark and bright rings, with dark
rings containing low dust density and small dust particles. Different features
in the HL Tau disk seem to have different origins. Planet-disk interactions can
explain substructure at the external half of the disk, but the internal rings
seem to be associated to the presence of snow lines of several molecules.

non-visually because the visual user interfaces change, interactions often
occur over multiple different screens, and it is easy to accidentally trigger
interface actions while exploring the screen. To solve these problems, we
introduce StateLens - a three-part reverse engineering solution that makes
existing dynamic touchscreens accessible. First, StateLens reverse engineers
the underlying state diagrams of existing interfaces using point-of-view videos
found online or taken by users using a hybrid crowd-computer vision pipeline.
Second, using the state diagrams, StateLens automatically generates
conversational agents to guide blind users through specifying the tasks that
the interface can perform, allowing the StateLens iOS application to provide
interactive guidance and feedback so that blind users can access the interface.
Finally, a set of 3D-printed accessories enable blind people to explore
capacitive touchscreens without the risk of triggering accidental touches on
the interface. Our technical evaluation shows that StateLens can accurately
reconstruct interfaces from stationary, hand-held, and web videos; and, a user

the scheme uses continuous bag of words to construct the semantic connection
between specific central words and their surrounding context. The detection of
medication anomaly is transformed into identifying the least possible central

numerical simulations continuously, but mainly in one dimension (1D), where the
magnetic field line is treated as a rigid flux tube. Whereas those
one-dimensional simulations can roughly reproduce the observed oscillation
periods, implying that gravity is the main restoring force for filament
longitudinal oscillations, the decay time in one-dimensional simulations is
generally longer than in observations. In this paper, we perform a
two-dimensional (2D) non-adiabatic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of filament
longitudinal oscillations, and compare it with the 2D adiabatic case and 1D
adiabatic and non-adiabatic cases. It is found that, whereas both non-adiabatic
processes (radiation and heat conduction) can significantly reduce the decay
time, wave leakage is another important mechanism to dissipate the kinetic
energy of the oscillating filament when the magnetic field is weak so that
gravity is comparable to Lorentz force. In this case, our simulations indicate
that the pendulum model might lead to an error of ~100% in determining the
curvature radius of the dipped magnetic field using the longitudinal
oscillation period when the gravity to Lorentz force ratio is close to unity.

results of both magnetic measurements and first-principles calculations
confirmed that spin frustrated and unfrustrated antiferromagnetic (AFM) states
coexist there and they have different magnetic anisotropies, which are
essential for SEB. Based on a series of measurement strategies, we demonstrate
that the frustrated AFM state undergoes a first-order magnetic transition to
the superferromagnet (SFM) state with the help of an external magnetic field,
and SFM is retained due to the first-order property of the magnetic transition.
SEB originates from the interface coupling of multiple sublattices between the

blocking temperature of SEB, which paves the way for improving the blocking

trade-off between selecting the largest galaxy samples (to minimize the shot

precision, which generally include only a small subset of galaxies. In this
paper, we systematically explore this trade-off. Our analysis is targeted
towards the third year data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), but our methods
hold generally for other data sets. Using a simple Gaussian model for the
redshift uncertainties, we carry out a Fisher matrix forecast for cosmological
constraints from angular clustering in the redshift range $z = 0.2-0.95$. We
quantify the cosmological constraints using a Figure of Merit (FoM) that
measures the combined constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ in the context
of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the trade-off between sample size and
photo-z precision is sensitive to 1) whether cross-correlations between
redshift bins are included or not, and 2) the ratio of the redshift bin width
$\delta z$ and the photo-z precision $\sigma_z$. When cross-correlations are
included and the redshift bin width is allowed to vary, the highest FoM is
achieved when $\delta z \sim \sigma_z$. We find that for the typical case of
$5-10$ redshift bins, optimal results are reached when we use larger, less
precise photo-z samples, provided that we include cross-correlations. For
samples with higher $\sigma_{z}$, the overlap between redshift bins is larger,
leading to higher cross-correlation amplitudes. This leads to the
self-calibration of the photo-z parameters and therefore tighter cosmological
constraints. These results can be used to help guide galaxy sample selection
for clustering analysis in ongoing and future photometric surveys.

trend filtering is superior to any statistical estimator that is a linear
combination of the observed data---including kernel smoothers, LOESS, smoothing
splines, Gaussian process regression, and many other popular methods.
Furthermore, the trend filtering estimate can be computed with practical and
scalable efficiency via a specialized convex optimization algorithm, e.g.
handling sample sizes of $n\gtrsim10^7$ within a few minutes. In a companion

that the observed softening of the zone-center $A_{1g}$ optical mode and

more complete picture of what drives the partial reversal of the Peierls

exploiting magnetic proximity effect on the TI surface from adjacent

an exchange gap with less disorder than that in the doped system. Nevertheless,
the engineering of a favorable heterointerface that realizes the QAHE based on
the magnetic proximity effect remains to be achieved. Here, we report on the
observation of the QAHE in a proximity coupled system of non-magnetic TI and

efficient proximity coupling in the all-telluride based heterostructure as

In diverse families of strongly correlated electron systems, the electron pairs
are not bound together by phonon exchange but instead by some other kind of
bosonic fluctuations. In these systems, superconductivity is often found near a
magnetic quantum critical point (QCP) where a magnetic phase vanishes in the
zero-temperature limit. Moreover, the maximum of superconducting transition
temperature Tc frequently locates near the magnetic QCP, suggesting that the
proliferation of critical spin fluctuations emanating from the QCP plays an
important role in Cooper pairing. In cuprate superconductors, however, the
superconducting dome is usually separated from the antiferromagnetic phase and
Tc attains its maximum value near the verge of enigmatic pseudogap state that
appears below doping-dependent temperature T*. Thus a clue to the pairing
mechanism resides in the pseudogap and associated anomalous transport
properties. Recent experiments suggested a phase transition at T*, yet, most
importantly, relevant fluctuations associated with the pseudogap have not been
identified. Here we report on direct observations of enhanced nematic
fluctuations in (Bi,Pb)2Sr2CaCu2O8+d by elastoresistance measurements, which
couple to twofold in-plane electronic anisotropy, i.e. electronic nematicity.
The nematic susceptibility shows Curie-Weiss-like temperature dependence above
T*, and an anomaly at T* evidences a second-order transition with broken
rotational symmetry. Near the pseudogap end point, where Tc is not far from its
peak in the superconducting dome, nematic susceptibility becomes singular and
divergent, indicating the presence of a nematic QCP. This signifies quantum
critical fluctuations of a nematic order, which has emerging links to the
high-Tc superconductivity and strange metallic behaviours in cuprates.

particulate suspensions increases drastically beyond a stress onset
($\sigma_0$), a phenomenon known as discontinuous shear-thickening (DST).
Recent studies point out that some suspensions can transform into a stress
induced solid-like shear jammed (SJ) state at high particle volume fraction
($\phi$). SJ state develops a finite yield stress and hence is distinct from a
shear-thickened state. Here, we study the steady state shear-thickening
behaviour of dense suspensions formed by dispersing colloidal polystyrene
particles (PS) in polyethylene glycol (PEG). We find that for small $\sigma$
values the viscosity of the suspensions as a function of $\phi$ can be well
described by Krieger-Dougherty (KD) relation. However, for higher values of
$\sigma$ ($>> \sigma_0$), KD relation systematically overestimates the measured
viscosity, particularly for higher $\phi$ values. This systematic deviation can
be rationalized by the weakening of the sample due to flow induced failures of
the solid-like SJ state. Using Wyart-Cates model, we propose a method to
predict the SJ onset from the steady state rheology measurements. Our results
are further supported by in-situ optical imaging of the sample boundary under
shear.

represent a rich class of models for classification and clustering, in Bayesian
statistics and machine learning. They also arise in various areas of
probability and its applications. Jim Pitman, within the species sampling
context, shows that mixed Poisson processes may be interpreted as the sample
size up till a given time or in terms of waiting times of appearance of
individuals to be classified. He notes connections to some recent work in the
Bayesian statistic/machine learning literature, with some more classical
results. We let $F:=F_{\alpha,\theta},$ be a Pitman-Yor process for $\alpha\in
(0,1),$ and $\theta>-\alpha,$ with $\alpha$-diversity equivalent in
distribution to $S^{-\alpha}_{\alpha,\theta},$ and let
$(N_{S_{\alpha,\theta}}(\lambda),\lambda\ge 0)$ denote a mixed Poisson process
with rate $S_{\alpha,\theta}.$ In this paper we derive explicit stick-breaking
representations of $F_{\alpha,\theta}$ given
$N_{S_{\alpha,\theta}}(\lambda)=m.$ More precisely, if $(P_{\ell})\sim
\mathrm{PD}(\alpha,\theta)$, denotes a ranked sequence following the two
parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution, we obtain explicit representations of
the sized biased permutation of $(P_{\ell})|N_{S_{\alpha,\theta}}(\lambda)=m.$
Due to distributional results we shall develop in a more general context, it
suffices to consider the stable case $F_{\alpha,0}|N_{S_{\alpha}}(\lambda)=m.$
Notably, it follows that $F_{\alpha,0}|N_{S_{\alpha}}(\lambda)=0,$ is
equivalent in distribution to the popular normalized generalized gamma process.
Hence, we obtain explicit stick-breaking representations for the generalized
gamma class as a special case.

incorporating induction principles into CHC solvers. However, this technique
may fail when the transformation requires the use of lemmata whose generation
needs ingenuity. In this paper we show, through an example, how during the

can introduce suitable predicates, called difference predicates, whose
definitions correspond to the lemmata to be introduced. Through a second

can introduce, instead, auxiliary queries which also correspond to lemmata, and
the proof of these lemmata can be done by showing the satisfiability of those

specialised versions of the same program code. The same program point can be
reached more than once during a computation, with different constraints
applying in each case, and polyvariant specialisation allows different
specialisations to be realised. A property-based abstraction uses a finite set
of properties to define a finite set of abstract versions of predicates,
ensuring that only a finite number of specialised versions is generated. The
particular choice of properties is critical for polyvariance; too few versions
can result in insufficient specialisation, while too many can result in an

analysis to estimate the probability distribution for the potential kick
velocity (PKV) a BHXB system could have received on formation. Constraining the
kicks imparted to BHXBs provides insight into the birth mechanism of black
holes (BHs). Kicks also have a significant effect on BH-BH merger rates, merger
sites, and binary evolution, and can be responsible for spin-orbit misalignment
in BH binary systems. $75\%$ of our systems have potential kicks

suggesting a lack of correlation between BH mass and the BH birth mechanism.
Our Python code allows the estimation of the PKV for any system with sufficient
observational constraints.

(GCs) older than ~10 Gyr, has caught lots of attention. Recently, cumulative
evidence indicates that extragalactic GCs that are older than 2 Gyr, seem to
also harbor MPs, however, those that are younger than 2 Gyr do not. These
observations seem to imply that age is a primary property that controls the
presence of MPs in star clusters. However, because of the lack of studies of
{intermediate-age (~2--6 Gyr-old),} low mass clusters, it is unclear if the
cluster mass, in addition to age, also plays a role in the occurrence of MPs.
In this work, we studied a $\sim$4 Gyr-old, low mass (~23,000 Msun) cluster,
Lindsay-113, in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Using Hubble Space Telescope
photometry, we find that the width of the red-giant branch in this cluster,
when measured in a specific color index that is sensitive to star-to-star
chemical variations, {can be adequately explained by a ""simple"" stellar
population model with some possible noises contributed from measurement
uncertainty, photometric artifact, as well as differential reddening. The
comparison of observations with predictions from synthetic spectra indicates
that the internal chemical spread in nitrogen abundance, which is a signature
of MPs, would not exceed 0.2 dex. Since Lindsay 113 is significantly older than
other GCs with MPs, we suggest that the onset of MPs is likely determined by
the combination of cluster age and mass.

capture of animals from images acquired in-the-wild. In particular, we focus on
the problem of capturing 3D information about Grevy's zebras from a collection
of images. The Grevy's zebra is one of the most endangered species in Africa,
with only a few thousand individuals left. Capturing the shape and pose of
these animals can provide biologists and conservationists with information
about animal health and behavior. In contrast to research on human pose, shape
and texture estimation, training data for endangered species is limited, the
animals are in complex natural scenes with occlusion, they are naturally
camouflaged, travel in herds, and look similar to each other. To overcome these
challenges, we integrate the recent SMAL animal model into a network-based
regression pipeline, which we train end-to-end on synthetically generated
images with pose, shape, and background variation. Going beyond
state-of-the-art methods for human shape and pose estimation, our method learns
a shape space for zebras during training. Learning such a shape space from
images using only a photometric loss is novel, and the approach can be used to
learn shape in other settings with limited 3D supervision. Moreover, we couple
3D pose and shape prediction with the task of texture synthesis, obtaining a
full texture map of the animal from a single image. We show that the predicted
texture map allows a novel per-instance unsupervised optimization over the
network features. This method, SMALST (SMAL with learned Shape and Texture)
goes beyond previous work, which assumed manual keypoints and/or segmentation,
to regress directly from pixels to 3D animal shape, pose and texture. Code and

pedestrian demand in public space, the limits of pedestrian spaces are of
increasing interest. Some research on the maximum demand that can flow through
a cross-section has been presented, which mainly features simple movement base
cases, low-density situations and/or a homogeneous crowd. Consequently, it is
currently unclear to what extent their findings apply to heterogeneous
high-density crowds, which are often encountered during real-world scenarios.
The CrowdLimits experiment attempted to reproduce crowd movement dynamics of
heterogeneous crowds experiencing higher densities than have been recorded up
to this moment. Here, the aim was to study the impact of the three important
differences between the current laboratory studies and real-world crowd
dynamics in crowded pedestrian spaces simultaneously, namely crowd
heterogeneity, high densities movements, and (more) complex movement base
cases. This study shows that there are substantial differences in the maximum
sustainable flow rate, and the maximum local and global sustainable density for
distinct movement base cases and flow ratios. Moreover, the results provide
evidence of that continuation of flow under very high densities can be
recreated under laboratory conditions using a heterogeneous population of
pedestrians. Besides, the experimental results indicate that the maximum global
flow rate decreases when the scenario becomes more difficult (i.e.
bidirectional to intersecting) and the collision avoidance opportunities
decrease (i.e. 80-20 to 50-50 flow ratio). Thus, this paper concludes that the
maximum flow rate of pedestrian infrastructures decreases with increasing
complexity.

approached by learning a natural motion manifold using deep learning to address
the shortcomings of traditional data-driven approaches. However, previous
methods can be sub-optimal for two reasons. First, the skeletal information has
not been fully utilized for feature extraction. Unlike images, it is difficult
to define spatial proximity in skeletal motions in the way that deep networks
can be applied. Second, motion is time-series data with strong multi-modal
temporal correlations. A frame could be followed by several candidate frames
leading to different motions; long-range dependencies exist where a number of
frames in the beginning correlate to a number of frames later. Ineffective
modeling would either under-estimate the multi-modality and variance, resulting
in featureless mean motion or over-estimate them resulting in jittery motions.
In this paper, we propose a new deep network to tackle these challenges by
creating a natural motion manifold that is versatile for many applications. The
network has a new spatial component for feature extraction. It is also equipped
with a new batch prediction model that predicts a large number of frames at
once, such that long-term temporally-based objective functions can be employed
to correctly learn the motion multi-modality and variances. With our system,
long-duration motions can be predicted/synthesized using an open-loop setup
where the motion retains the dynamics accurately. It can also be used for
denoising corrupted motions and synthesizing new motions with given control
signals. We demonstrate that our system can create superior results comparing
to existing work in multiple applications.

concerning symmetry-breaking instabilities in heterogeneous media. It is
nontrivial to separate observed spatial patterning due to inherent spatial
heterogeneity from emergent patterning due to nonlinear instability. We employ
WKBJ asymptotics to investigate Turing instabilities for a spatially
heterogeneous reaction-diffusion system, and derive conditions for instability
which are local versions of the classical Turing conditions We find that the
structure of unstable modes differs substantially from the typical
trigonometric functions seen in the spatially homogeneous setting. Modes of
different growth rates are localized to different spatial regions. This
localization helps explain common amplitude modulations observed in simulations
of Turing systems in heterogeneous settings. We numerically demonstrate this
theory, giving an illustrative example of the emergent instabilities and the
striking complexity arising from spatially heterogeneous reaction-diffusion
systems. Our results give insight both into systems driven by exogenous
heterogeneity, as well as successive pattern forming processes, noting that
most scenarios in biology do not involve symmetry breaking from homogeneity,
but instead consist of sequential evolutions of heterogeneous states. The
instability mechanism reported here precisely captures such evolution, and
extends Turing's original thesis to a far wider and more realistic class of
systems.

neutron scattering instruments and the use of these types of algorithms for
this purpose is becoming more and more commonplace. Today there exists a wide
range of algorithms to choose from when designing an instrument and it is not
always initially clear which may provide the best performance. Furthermore, due
to the nature of these types of algorithms, the final solution found for a
specific design scenario cannot always be guaranteed to be the global optimum.
Therefore, to explore the potential benefits and differences between the
varieties of these algorithms available, when applied to such design scenarios,
we have carried out a detailed study of some commonly used algorithms. For this
purpose, we have developed a new general optimization software package which
combines a number of common metaheuristic algorithms within a single user
interface and is designed specifically with neutronic calculations in mind. The
algorithms included in the software are implementations of Particle-Swarm
Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC),
and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The software has been used to optimize the design
of several problems in neutron optics and shielding, coupled with Monte-Carlo
simulations, in order to evaluate the performance of the various algorithms.
Generally, the performance of the algorithms depended on the specific
scenarios, however it was found that DE provided the best average solutions in
all scenarios investigated in this work.

is limited, since they estimate the reconstruction error for an entire image in
the same way, without considering any semantic information. In this paper, we
propose a novel method to benefit from perceptual loss in a more objective way.
We optimize a deep network-based decoder with a targeted objective function
that penalizes images at different semantic levels using the corresponding
terms. In particular, the proposed method leverages our proposed OBB (Object,
Background and Boundary) labels, generated from segmentation labels, to
estimate a suitable perceptual loss for boundaries, while considering texture
similarity for backgrounds. We show that our proposed approach results in more

approach to the analysis and construction of such magnetospheres. We consider
force-free electrodynamics close to the rotation axis of a magnetosphere
surrounding a Kerr black hole assuming axisymmetry. This is the region where
the force-free approximation should work the best, and where the jets are
located. We perform a systematic study of the asymptotic region with
(split-)monopole, paraboloidal and vertical asymptotic behaviors. Imposing
asymptotics similar to a (split-)monopole, we find under certain assumptions
that demanding regularity at the rotation axis and the event horizon restricts
solutions of the stream equation so much that it is not possible for a solution
to be continuously connected to the static (split-)monopole around the
Schwarzschild black hole in the limit where the rotation goes to zero. On the
one hand, this result provides independent evidence to the issues discovered
with the asymptotics of the Blandford-Znajek (split-)monopole in Ref. [1]. On

could conceivably exploit to amend the perturbative construction of the

distributed in an arc shape around an extended HII region. We use the Very
Large Array in its CnB and D configurations, and in the frequency bands C (4--8

recombination line maps are obtained. We detect radio continuum emission in
SgrB2(DS) in a bubble-shaped structure. From 4 to 12 GHz, we derive a spectral
index between -1.2 and -0.4, indicating the presence of non-thermal emission.
We decompose the contribution from thermal and non-thermal emission, and find
that the thermal component is clumpy and more concentrated, while the
non-thermal component is more extended and diffuse. The radio recombination
lines in the region are found to be not in local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE) but stimulated by the non-thermal emission. The thermal free-free
emission is likely tracing an HII region ionized by an O7 star, while the
non-thermal emission can be generated by relativistic electrons created through
first-order Fermi acceleration. We have developed a simple model of the

the reduced curvature of the hole pockets under pressure. Combining our

of the emission of HII regions. Usually this category of objects is dominated
by thermal radiation produced by ionised hydrogen, namely protons and
electrons. However, a number of observational studies have revealed the
existence of HII regions with a mixture of thermal and non-thermal radiation.
The latter represents a clue as to the presence of relativistic electrons.
However, neither the interstellar cosmic-ray electron flux nor the flux of
secondary electrons, produced by primary cosmic rays through ionisation
processes, is high enough to explain the observed flux densities. We
investigate the possibility of accelerating local thermal electrons up to
relativistic energies in HII region shocks. We assumed that relativistic
electrons can be accelerated through the first-order Fermi acceleration
mechanism and we estimated the emerging electron fluxes, the corresponding flux
densities, and the spectral indexes. We find flux densities of the same order
of magnitude of those observed. In particular, we applied our model to the
""deep south"" (DS) region of Sagittarius B2 and we succeeded in reproducing the
observed flux densities with an accuracy of less than 20% as well as the
spectral indexes. The model also gives constraints on magnetic field strength
($0.3-4$ mG), density ($1-9\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$), and flow velocity in the
shock reference frame ($33-50$ km s$^{-1}$) expected in DS. We suggest a
mechanism able to accelerate thermal electrons inside HII regions through the
first-order Fermi acceleration. The existence of a local source of relativistic
electrons can explain the origin of both the observed non-thermal emission and
the corresponding spectral indexes.

history of our universe. We propose a theory that is based solely on local
processes, namely the dust opacity limit, the tidal forces and the properties
of the collapsing gas envelope. The idea is that the final mass of the central
object is determined by the location of the nearest fragments, which accrete
the gas located further away, preventing it to fall onto the central object. To
estimate the relevant statistics in the neighbourhood of an accreting
protostar, we perform high resolution numerical simulations. We also use these
simulations to further test the idea that fragmentation in the vicinity of an
existing protostar is determinant in setting the peak of the stellar mass
spectrum. We develop an analytical model, which is based on a statistical
counting of the turbulent density fluctuations, generated during the collapse,
that are at least equal to the mass of the first hydrostatic core, and
sufficiently important to supersede tidal and pressure forces to be
self-gravitating. The analytical mass function presents a peak located at
roughly 10 times the mass of the first hydrostatic core in good agreement with
the numerical simulations. Since the physical processes involved are all local,
i.e. occurs at scales of a few 100 AU or below, and do not depend on the gas
distribution at large scale and global properties such as the mean Jeans mass,
the mass spectrum is expected to be relatively universal.

age of R~CrA. In addition, we model the periodic modulation of the light curve
as due to partial attenuation of a central binary by a circumbinary disk. This
model reproduces very well the observations. We found that the central object
in R~CrA is a very young ($1.5\pm 1.5$~Myr), highly absorbed ($A_V=5.47\pm
0.4$~mag) binary; we obtain masses of $M_A=3.02\pm 0.43$~M$_\odot$ and
$M_B=2.32\pm 0.35$~M$_\odot$ for the two components. We propose that the
secular decrease of the R~CrA apparent luminosity is due to a progressive
increase of the disk absorption. This might be related to precession of a
slightly inclined disk caused by the recently discovered M-dwarf companion.
Thus, R~CrA may be a triple system hosting a disk.

${\mathcal S}^r(M)$ is not real closed for $r\geq1$, the Zariski and maximal

the environment and interact with humans. In such dynamic scenarios, robotic
tasks may be programmed through learning-from-demonstration approaches, where a
nominal plan of the task is learned by the robot. However, the learned plan may
need to be adapted in order to fulfill additional requirements or overcome
unexpected environment changes. When the required adaptation occurs at the
end-effector trajectory level, a human operator may want to intuitively show
the robot the desired changes by physically interacting with it. In this
scenario, the robot needs to understand the human intended changes from noisy
haptic data, quickly adapt accordingly and execute the nominal task plan when
no further adaptation is needed. This paper addresses the aforementioned
challenges by leveraging LfD and Bayesian optimization to endow the robot with
data-efficient adaptation capabilities. Our approach exploits the sensed
interaction forces to guide the robot adaptation, and speeds up the
optimization process by defining local search spaces extracted from the learned
task model. We show how our framework quickly adapts the learned
spatial-temporal patterns of the task, leading to deformed trajectory
distributions that are consistent with the nominal plan and the changes

scatterers using far-field optical imaging techniques is of utmost importance
for a wide range of applications in medicine, biology, astronomy, and physics.
Although the optical wavelength sets a fundamental limit to the image
resolution of unknown objects, the position of an individual emitter can in
principle be estimated from the image with arbitrary precision. This is used,
e.g., in stars' position determination and in optical super-resolution
microscopy. Furthermore, precise position determination is an experimental
prerequisite for the manipulation and measurement of individual quantum
systems, such as atoms, ions, and solid state-based quantum emitters. Here we
demonstrate that spin-orbit coupling of light in the emission of elliptically
polarized emitters can lead to systematic, wavelength-scale errors in the
estimate of the emitter's position. Imaging a single trapped atom as well as a
single sub-wavelength-diameter gold nanoparticle, we demonstrate a shift
between the emitters' measured and actual positions which is comparable to the
optical wavelength. Remarkably, for certain settings, the expected shift can
become arbitrarily large. Beyond their relevance for optical imaging
techniques, our findings apply to the localization of objects using any type of
wave that carries orbital angular momentum relative to the emitter's position
with a component orthogonal to the direction of observation.

high-tolerance assembly operations, and improvement of real-world performance
engender a need for positionally accurate robots. Despite tight machining
tolerances, good mechanical design, and careful assembly, robotic arms
typically exhibit average Cartesian positioning errors of several millimeters.
Fortunately, the vast majority of this error can be removed in software by
proper calibration of the so-called ""zero-offsets"" of a robot's joints. This
research developed an automated, inexpensive, highly portable, in situ
calibration method that fine tunes these kinematic parameters, thereby,
improving a robot's average positioning accuracy four-fold throughout its
workspace. In particular, a prospective low-cost motion capture system and a
benchmark laser tracker were used as reference sensors for robot calibration.
Bayesian inference produced optimized zero-offset parameters alongside their
uncertainty for data from both reference sensors. Relative and absolute
accuracy metrics were proposed and applied for quantifying robot positioning
accuracy. Uncertainty analysis of a validated, probabilistic robot model
quantified the absolute positioning accuracy throughout its entire workspace.
Altogether, three measures of accuracy conclusively revealed multi-fold
improvement in the positioning accuracy of the robotic arm. Bayesian inference
on motion capture data yielded zero-offsets and accuracy calculations
comparable to those derived from laser tracker data, ultimately proving this
method's viability towards robot calibration.

salient object detection. However, they are typically limited to input images
with low resolutions ($400\times400$ pixels or less). Little effort has been
made to train deep neural networks to directly handle salient object detection
in very high-resolution images. This paper pushes forward high-resolution
saliency detection, and contributes a new dataset, named High-Resolution
Salient Object Detection (HRSOD). To our best knowledge, HRSOD is the first
high-resolution saliency detection dataset to date. As another contribution, we
also propose a novel approach, which incorporates both global semantic
information and local high-resolution details, to address this challenging
task. More specifically, our approach consists of a Global Semantic Network
(GSN), a Local Refinement Network (LRN) and a Global-Local Fusion Network
(GLFN). GSN extracts the global semantic information based on down-sampled
entire image. Guided by the results of GSN, LRN focuses on some local regions
and progressively produces high-resolution predictions. GLFN is further
proposed to enforce spatial consistency and boost performance. Experiments
illustrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on
high-resolution saliency datasets by a large margin, and achieves comparable or
even better performance than them on widely-used saliency benchmarks. The HRSOD

solid-solid phase transformation that is accompanied by a sudden disappearance
of an inversion symmetry. Much effort has been put to understand the
ferroelectric transition at the polarization length scale. Nevertheless, the
dipole-moment origin of ferroelectricity has remained elusive. Here, we used
variable-temperature high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to reveal
the dipole-moment dynamics during the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition.
We show that the transition occurs when paraelectric nuclei of the size of a
couple of unit cells emerge near the surface. Upon heating, the cubic phase
sidewalk grows towards the bulk. We quantified the nucleation barrier and show
dominancy of mechanical interactions, helping us demonstrate similarities to
predictions of domain nucleation during electric field switching. Our work
motivates dynamic atomic-scale characterizations of solid-solid transitions in
other materials.

dichotomy in the following sense. Suppose ${\boldsymbol\sigma}$ is a
permutation chosen uniformly at random from the set of all permutations of
$[n]$ with exactly $m=m(n)\ll n^2$ inversions. If $i<j$ are chosen uniformly at

asymptotically almost surely. However, if $i$ and $j$ are chosen so that

$\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}\big[{\boldsymbol\sigma}(i)<{\boldsymbol\sigma}(j)\big]=\frac{1}{2}$.
Moreover, if $k=k(n)\ll \sqrt{m/n}$, then the restriction of
${\boldsymbol\sigma}$ to a random $k$-point interval is asymptotically
uniformly distributed over $\mathcal{S}_k$. Thus, knowledge of the local
structure of ${\boldsymbol\sigma}$ reveals nothing about its global form. We
establish that $\sqrt{m/n}$ is the threshold for local uniformity and $m/n$ the
threshold for inversions, and determine the behaviour in the critical windows.

easily rectifiable (see comments on pages 9 and 15). So the results stated

we built a series of three-layer models, and considered both Airy and Pratt
compensation mechanisms. The interpretation is non-unique, but Dione's excess
topography may suggest some degree of Airy-type isostasy, meaning that the

spin-(1/2,1) Ising-Heisenberg double-tetrahedral chain in an external magnetic
field as another particular example of 1D lattice-statistical model with
short-range interactions that displays a pseudo-transition of this type. The
investigated model exhibits at zero temperature three ferrimagnetic phases,
three frustrated phases, and one saturated paramagnetic phase. The ground-state
phase diagram involves five unusual interfaces (phase boundaries), at which the
residual entropy per site equals to a larger entropy of one of two coexisting
phases. Four such interfaces are between a non-degenerate ferrimagnetic phase
and a macroscopically degenerate frustrated phase, while one interface is
between two non-degenerate ferrimagnetic phases. Though thermal excitations
typically destroy all fingerprints of zero-temperature phase transitions of 1D
lattice-statistical models with short-range forces, the mixed spin-(1/2,1)
Ising-Heisenberg double-tetrahedral chain is quite robust with respect to
thermal excitations and it displays peculiar pseudo-transitions close to all
five aforementioned interfaces.

experimental resource for exploring optomechanical synchronizations and
correlations. In this work, we investigate the phenomena of quantum
synchronization and quantum correlations in two optically coupled
optomechanical oscillators with two different topologies. In one case the
oscillators are coupled with optical photons in a reversible manner, termed as
bidirectional coupling, while in the other photons are allowed to enter to the
other oscillator but not allowed to exchanged back in the opposite direction,
termed as unidirectional coupling. Our results shows that irrespective of these
configurations, when synchronization builds up, the two oscillators also become
quantum mechanically correlated with a finite degree of Gaussian quantum
discord. However, we find that depending on these topologies, both
synchronization and quantum discord behave in a very distinctive manner. For
instance, in bidirectionally coupled optomechanical oscillators, we find both
quantum synchronization and discord exhibit a tongue like pattern which is the
quantum analogue of an Arnold tongue. Whereas, in the unidirectionally coupled
oscillators, we observe a novel blockade like behavior for quantum phase
synchronization, also known as the quantum synchronization blockade, while
quantum discord being failed to map such an anomalous behavior.

Cherenkov and/or other collisional radiation when traveling faster than the

Compton or synchrotron shock radiation) when traveling slower than the speed of

light curve features through the process of Relativistic Image Doubling (RID).
The model can account for a variety of unexplained yet observed GRB pulse

pulse residuals and the relationship between stretching factor and pulse
asymmetry. The model is applicable to all GRB classes since similar pulse
behaviors are observed in long/intermediate GRBs, short GRBs, and x-ray flares.
The free model parameters are the impactor's Lorentz factor when moving
subluminally, its Lorentz factor when moving superluminally, and the speed of

sufficient for the identification of RL AGNs. A sample of 355 quasars was
selected by cross-correlating the FIRST survey with the SDSS DR14 quasar
catalog. We classified the optical spectra according to their spectral types
along the quasars MS. For each spectral type, we distinguished compact and
extended morphology, and three classes of radio-loudness: detected (specific
flux ratio in the g band and at 1.4GHz, RK' < 10, RD), intermediate (10 < RK' <
70, RI), and radio loud (RK' > 70). The analysis revealed systematic
differences between RD, RI, and RL in each spectral type along the MS. We show
that spectral bins that contain the extreme Population A sources have radio
power compatible with emission by mechanisms ultimately due to star formation
processes. RL sources of Population B are characteristically jetted. Their
broad H-beta profiles can be interpreted as due to a binary broad-line region.
We suggest that RL Population B sources should be preferential targets for the
search of black hole binaries, and present a sample of binary black hole AGN
candidates. The validity of the Kellermann's criterion may be dependent on the
source location along the quasar MS. The consideration of the MS trends allowed
to distinguish between sources whose radio emission mechanisms is jetted from
the ones where the mechanism is likely to be fundamentally different.

reaction-diffusion models. The study of such systems goes back to Turing, who
showed how patterns can emerge from a homogenous steady state when two reactive
components have different diffusivities (e.g. membrane-bound and cytosolic
states). However, in nature, systems typically develop in a heterogeneous
environment, where upstream protein patterns affect the formation of protein
patterns downstream. Examples for this are the polarization of Cdc42 adjacent
to the previous bud-site in budding yeast, and the formation of an
actin-recruiter ring that forms around a PIP3 domain in macropinocytosis. This
suggests that previously established protein patterns can serve as a template
for downstream proteins and that these downstream proteins can 'sense' the edge
of the template. A mechanism for how this edge sensing may work remains
elusive. Here we demonstrate and analyze a generic and robust edge-sensing
mechanism, based on a two-component mass-conserving reaction-diffusion (McRD)
model. Our analysis is rooted in a recently developed theoretical framework for
McRD systems, termed local equilibria theory. We extend this framework to
capture the spatially heterogeneous reaction kinetics due to the template. This
enables us to graphically construct the stationary patterns in the phase space
of the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, we show that the protein template can
trigger a regional mass-redistribution instability near the template edge,
leading to the accumulation of protein mass, which eventually results in a
stationary peak at the template edge. We show that simple geometric criteria on
the reactive nullcline's shape predict when this edge-sensing mechanism is
operational. Thus, our results provide guidance for future studies of
biological systems, and for the design of synthetic pattern forming systems.

However, the usefulness of single-event alignment has not been sufficiently
evaluated in composite visualizations. Furthermore, recently proposed
dual-event alignment techniques have not been empirically evaluated. In this
work, we designed tasks around temporal event sequence and timing analysis and
conducted a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to examine four
sentinel event alignment approaches: no sentinel event alignment (NoAlign),
single-event alignment (SingleAlign), dual-event alignment with left
justification (DualLeft), and dual-event alignment with stretch justification
(DualStretch). Differences between approaches were most pronounced with more
rows of data. For understanding intermediate events between two sentinel
events, dual-event alignment was the clear winner for correctness---71% vs. 18%
for NoAlign and SingleAlign. For understanding the duration between two
sentinel events, NoAlign was the clear winner: correctness---88% vs. 36% for
DualStretch---completion time---55 seconds vs. 101 seconds for DualLeft---and
error---1.5% vs. 8.4% for DualStretch. For understanding precursor and

trainees is a laborious task that is very expensive, time-consuming and prone
to subjectivity. With the number of surgical procedures increasing annually,
there is an unprecedented need to provide an accurate, objective and automatic
evaluation of trainees' surgical skills in order to improve surgical practice.
Methods: In this paper, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to
classify surgical skills by extracting latent patterns in the trainees' motions
performed during robotic surgery. The method is validated on the JIGSAWS
dataset for two surgical skills evaluation tasks: classification and
regression. Results: Our results show that deep neural networks constitute
robust machine learning models that are able to reach new competitive
state-of-the-art performance on the JIGSAWS dataset. While we leveraged from
CNNs' efficiency, we were able to minimize its black-box effect using the class
activation map technique. Conclusions: This characteristic allowed our method
to automatically pinpoint which parts of the surgery influenced the skill
evaluation the most, thus allowing us to explain a surgical skill
classification and provide surgeons with a novel personalized feedback
technique. We believe this type of interpretable machine learning model could
integrate within ""Operation Room 2.0"" and support novice surgeons in improving

successes of the theory, one of its cornerstones, namely a conjectured
expression for the currents of the conserved charges in local equilibrium has
not yet been proven for interacting lattice models. Here we fill this gap, and
compute an exact result for the mean values of current operators in Bethe
Ansatz solvable systems, valid in arbitrary finite volume. Our exact formula
has a simple semi-classical interpretation: the currents can be computed by
summing over the charge eigenvalues carried by the individual bare particles,
multiplied with an effective velocity describing their propagation in the
presence of the other particles. Remarkably, the semi-classical formula remains
exact in the interacting quantum theory, for any finite number of particles and
also in the thermodynamic limit. Our proof is built on a form factor expansion

impairment genuinely affects the overall quality of life and wellbeing.
  The cocktail party effect, which is a healthy hearing individual's ability to
understand one voice in a cacophony of other voices or sounds, is an important
ability lacking in people with hearing impairment. This inability results in
difficulties with simple daily activities such as partaking in group
discussions or conversing in noisy restaurants [6]. This smart hearing aid aims
to provide much-needed assistance with understanding speech in noisy
environments. For example, if a person wants to partake in a group discussion,
he/she needs to place the microphone array based unit on a flat surface in
front of him/her, such as a table. When conversations take place, the
microphone array will capture and process sound from all directions,
intelligently prioritise and provide the lead speaker's voice by suppressing
unwanted noises, including speeches of other people. This device selects and
alternates voices between speakers automatically using voice algorithms.
Additionally, the user has the option of further fine-tuning the acoustic
parameters as needed through a smartphone interface. This paper describes the

circulant matrices, skew-circulant matrices, and triangular Toeplitz matrices.
In particular, we reduce the calculation of the Smith form of the matrix

of the Smith form of $f(C_g)$ to the properties of the polynomial $g(t)$ and
the equivalence classes $[f(t)]\in Q_g$. As an application we let $f(t)$ be the

position with low latency and high sampling rate. Altering the ball to simplify
the tracking using for instance infrared coating changes the physics of the
ball trajectory. As a result, table tennis systems use custom tracking systems
to track the ball based on heuristic algorithms respecting the real time
constrains applied to RGB images captured with a set of cameras. However, these
heuristic algorithms often report erroneous ball positions, and the table
tennis policies typically need to incorporate additional heuristics to detect
and possibly correct outliers. In this paper, we propose a vision system for
object detection and tracking that focus on reliability while providing real
time performance. Our assumption is that by using multiple cameras, we can find
and discard the errors obtained in the object detection phase by checking for
consistency with the positions reported by other cameras. We provide an open
source implementation of the proposed tracking system to simplify future
research in robot table tennis or related tracking applications with strong
real time requirements. We evaluate the proposed system thoroughly in
simulation and in the real system, outperforming previous work. Furthermore, we
show that the accuracy and robustness of the proposed system increases as more
cameras are added. Finally, we evaluate the table tennis playing performance of
an existing method in the real robot using the proposed vision system. We
measure a slight increase in performance compared to a previous vision system
even after removing all the heuristics previously present to filter out
erroneous ball observations.

  Logics",,,,"cs.CL quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work on vector-based compositional natural language semantics has
proposed the use of density matrices to model lexical ambiguity and (graded)
entailment (e.g. Piedeleu et al 2015, Bankova et al 2019, Sadrzadeh et al
2018). Ambiguous word meanings, in this work, are represented as mixed states,
and the compositional interpretation of phrases out of their constituent parts
takes the form of a strongly monoidal functor sending the derivational
morphisms of a pregroup syntax to linear maps in FdHilb. Our aims in this paper
are threefold. Firstly, we replace the pregroup front end by a Lambek
categorial grammar with directional implications expressing a word's
selectional requirements. By the Curry-Howard correspondence, the derivations
of the grammar's type logic are associated with terms of the (ordered) linear
lambda calculus; these terms can be read as programs for compositional meaning
assembly with density matrices as the target semantic spaces. Secondly, we
extend on the existing literature and introduce a symmetric, nondegenerate
bilinear form called a ""metric"" that defines a canonical isomorphism between a
vector space and its dual, allowing us to keep a distinction between left and
right implication. Thirdly, we use this metric to define density matrix spaces
in a directional form, modeling the ubiquitous derivational ambiguity of
natural language syntax, and show how this alows an integrated treatment of
lexical and derivational forms of ambiguity controlled at the level of the
interpretation.

As opposed to standard cavity optomechanics where the aim is to isolate and
cool a single mechanical mode, the aim here is to extract the thermal energy
from many vibrational modes within a large frequency bandwidth. We consider a
standard cold-damping technique where homodyne read-out of the cavity output
field is fed into a feedback loop that provides a cooling action directly
applied on the mechanical resonator. Analytical and numerical results predict
that low final occupancies are achievable independently of the number of modes
addressed by the feedback as long as the cooling rate is smaller than the
intermode frequency separation. For resonators exhibiting a few nearly
degenerate pairs of modes cooling is less efficient and a weak dependence on
the number of modes is obtained. These scalings hint towards the design of
frequency resolved mechanical resonators where efficient refrigeration is
possible via simultaneous cold-damping feedback.

studies while allowing unit-level treatment effects to vary. The methods may be
applied to studies using any optimal without-replacement matching algorithm. In
contrast to randomized experiments and to paired observational studies, we show
for general matched designs that over a large class of test statistics, any
valid sensitivity analysis for the entirety of the weak null must be
unnecessarily conservative if Fisher's sharp null of no treatment effect for
any individual also holds. We present a sensitivity analysis valid for the weak
null, and illustrate why it is generally conservative if the sharp null holds
through new connections to inverse probability weighted estimators. An
alternative procedure is presented that is asymptotically sharp if treatment
effects are constant, and that is valid for the weak null under additional
restrictions which may be deemed benign by practitioners. Simulations
demonstrate that this alternative procedure results in a valid sensitivity
analysis for the weak null hypothesis under a host of reasonable
data-generating processes. The procedures allow practitioners to assess
robustness of estimated sample average treatment effects to hidden bias while
allowing for unspecified effect heterogeneity in matched observational studies.

Identifying the distribution of water ice in debris disks is therefore of great
interest in the field of astrobiology. Furthermore, icy dust grains are
expected to play important roles throughout the entire planet formation
process. However, currently available observations only allow deriving weak
conclusions about the existence of water ice in debris disks. We investigate
whether it is feasible to detect water ice in typical debris disk systems. We
take the following ice destruction mechanisms into account: sublimation of ice,
dust production through planetesimal collisions, and photosputtering by
UV-bright central stars. We consider icy dust mixture particles with various
shapes consisting of amorphous ice, crystalline ice, astrosilicate, and vacuum
inclusions. We calculated optical properties of inhomogeneous icy dust mixtures
using effective medium theories, that is, Maxwell-Garnett rules. Subsequently,
we generated synthetic debris disk observables, such as spectral energy
distributions and spatially resolved thermal reemission and scattered light
intensity and polarization maps with our code DMS. We find that the prominent
$\sim$ 3 $\mu\rm{m}$ and 44 $\mu\rm{m}$ water ice features can be potentially
detected in future observations of debris disks with the James Webb Space
Telescope and the Space Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics. We
show that the sublimation of ice, collisions between planetesimals, and
photosputtering caused by UV sources clearly affect the observational
appearance of debris disk systems. In addition, highly porous ice tends to
produce highly polarized radiation at around 3 $\mu\rm{m}$. Finally, the
location of the ice survival line is determined by various dust properties such
as a fractional ratio of ice versus dust, physical states of ice, and the
porosity of icy grains.

molecules in high vacuum. Here, we report an approach to making 2D crystals of
covalent solids by chemical conversion of van der Waals layers. As an example,
we use 2D indium selenide (InSe) obtained by exfoliation and converted it by
direct fluorination into indium fluoride (InF3), which has a non-layered,
rhombohedral structure and therefore cannot be possibly obtained by
exfoliation. The conversion of InSe into InF3 is found to be feasible for
thicknesses down to three layers of InSe, and the obtained stable InF3 layers
are doped with selenium. We study this new 2D material by optical, electron
transport and Raman measurements and show that it is a semiconductor with a
direct bandgap of 2.2 eV, exhibiting high optical transparency across the
visible and infrared spectral ranges. We also demonstrate the scalability of
our approach by chemical conversion of large-area, thin InSe laminates obtained
by liquid exfoliation into InF3 films. The concept of chemical conversion of
cleavable thin van der Waals crystals into covalently-bonded non-cleavable ones
opens exciting prospects for synthesizing a wide variety of novel atomically
thin covalent crystals.

studies of interface transmission, the (001) surface of the crystal was covered
by several hundred nm thick metallic layers of either Pb, or Nb, or In. DC
current-voltage characteristics and AC differential conductance through the
interfaces as a function of the DC bias were investigated. When the metals
become superconducting, all three types of junctions show conductance increase,
pointing out the Andreev reflection as a prevalent contribution to the subgap
conductance. In the case of Pb-NbP and Nb-NbP junctions, the effect is
satisfactorily described by modified Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model. The
absolute value of the conductance is much smaller than that for the bulk
crystal, indicating that the transmission occurs through only a small part of
the contact area. An opposite situation occurs in In-NbP junction, where the
conductance at the peak reaches the bulk value indicating that almost whole
contact area is transmitting and, additionally, a superconducting proximity
phase is formed in the material. We interpret this as a result of indium
diffusion into NbP, where the metal atoms penetrate the surface barrier and
form very transparent superconductor-Weyl semimetal contact inside. However,
further diffusion occurring already at room temperature leads to degradation of
the effect, so it is observed only in the pristine structures. Despite of this,
our observation directly demonstrates possibility of inducing superconductivity
in a type-I Weyl semimetal.

limited in the first place by an incomplete ferroelectric switching. This can
be explained by the existence of a preferential polarization direction set by
the atomic terminations at the interface. More importantly, we also find that
the field-effect carrier doping is accompanied by a strong modulation of the
carrier mobility. Besides making quantification of field-effects via Hall
measurements not straightforward, this finding suggests that ferroelectric
poling produces structural changes (e.g. charged defects or structural
distortions) in the correlated oxide channel. Those findings have important
consequences for the understanding of ferroelectric field-effects and for the

contextualized word embeddings, which allow parsers to pack information about

transition-based parsers more than graph-based parsers, making the two
approaches virtually equivalent in terms of both accuracy and error profile. We
argue that the reason is that these representations help prevent search errors
and thereby allow transition-based parsers to better exploit their inherent
strength of making accurate local decisions. We support this explanation by an
error analysis of parsing experiments on 13 languages.

an outstanding question ever since its first detection by ISO some 20 years
ago. Water can originate from interplanetary dust particles, icy rings and
satellites and large comet impacts. Analysis of Herschel Space Observatory
observations have proven that the bulk of Jupiter's stratospheric water was
delivered by the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts in 1994. In 2006, the Cassini mission
detected water plumes at the South Pole of Enceladus, placing the moon as a
serious candidate for Saturn's stratospheric water. Further evidence was found
in 2011, when Herschel demonstrated the presence of a water torus at the
orbital distance of Enceladus, fed by the moon's plumes. Finally, water falling
from the rings onto Saturn's uppermost atmospheric layers at low latitudes was
detected during the final orbits of Cassini's end-of-mission plunge into the
atmosphere. Aims. In this paper, we use Herschel mapping observations of water
in Saturn's stratosphere to identify its source. Methods. Several empirical
models are tested against the Herschel-HIFI and -PACS observations, which were
collected on December 30, 2010, and January 2nd, 2011 (respectively). Results.
We demonstrate that Saturn's stratospheric water is not uniformly mixed as a
function of latitude, but peaking at the equator and decreasing poleward with a
Gaussian distribution. We obtain our best fit with an equatorial mole fraction
1.1 ppb and a half-width at half-maximum of 25{\deg}, when accounting for a
temperature increase in the two warm stratospheric vortices produced by
Saturn's Great Storm of 2010-2011. Conclusions. This work demonstrates that
Enceladus is the main source of Saturn's stratospheric water.

instantaneous volatility of the asset log-return is a diffusion with a
quadratic drift and a linear dispersion function. The instantaneous volatility
mean reverts around a constant level, with a speed of mean reversion that is
affine in the instantaneous volatility level. The steady-state distribution of
the instantaneous volatility belongs to the class of Generalized Inverse
Gaussian distributions. We show that the quadratic term in the drift is crucial
to avoid moment explosions and to preserve the martingale property of the stock
price process. Using a conveniently chosen change of measure, we relate the
model to the class of polynomial diffusions. This remarkable relation allows us
to develop a highly accurate option price approximation technique based on
orthogonal polynomial expansions.

To address the above issues, Federated Learning (FL) has been recently proposed
as a means to leave data and computational resources distributed over a large
number of nodes (clients) where a central coordinating server aggregates only
locally computed updates without knowing the original data. In this work, we
extend the FL framework by pushing forward the state the art in the field on
several dimensions: (i) unlike the original FedAvg approach relying solely on
single criteria (i.e., local dataset size), a suite of domain- and
client-specific criteria constitute the basis to compute each local client's
contribution, (ii) the multi-criteria contribution of each device is computed
in a prioritized fashion by leveraging a priority-aware aggregation operator
used in the field of information retrieval, and (iii) a mechanism is proposed
for online-adjustment of the aggregation operator parameters via a local search
strategy with backtracking. Extensive experiments on a publicly available
dataset indicate the merits of the proposed approach compared to standard
FedAvg baseline.

analysis of quantum masking. First, we show a general result on quantum channel
mixing that a subchannel's mixing probability should be suppressed if its
classical capacity is larger than the mixed channel's capacity. This constraint
combined with the well-known information conservation law, a law that does not
exist in classical information theory, gives a lower bound of randomness cost
of masking quantum information as a monotone decreasing function of evenness of
information distribution. This result provides a consistency test for various
scenarios of fast scrambling conjecture on the black hole evaporation process.
The results given here are robust to incompleteness of quantum masking.

properties like for example associativity, the same is not true for the
cyclically reduced product which has been very little studied in the
literature. Recently Sergei Ivanov has proved that the Andrews-Curtis
conjecture (stated in 1965 and still not solved) is equivalent to a formulation
where the reduced product is replaced by the cyclically reduced product (and
the conjugations replaced by cyclic permutations). In this paper we study
properties of the cyclically reduced product $*$ and of the set of cyclically
reduced words $\hat{\mathcal{F}(X)}$ equipped with $*$. In particular we find
that even if $*$ is not commutative nor verifies the Latin square property,
weaker versions of these properties hold true. We also show that
$\hat{\mathcal{F}(X)}$ equipped with $*$ and with cyclic permutations enjoys
similar properties as the free group equipped with the reduced product and
conjugations.

proposed to represent amalgamation in positroid varieties by equivalence
classes of relations on bipartite graphs and identify total non-negativity via
edge signatures. Here we provide an explicit characterization of such

indices ruled by orientation and gauge ray direction. The image of this map
coincides with that of Postnikov boundary measurement map. We solve the system
of geometric relations generalizing Postnikov's and Talaska's results for the
boundary edges to the internal edges of the graphs: the edge vector components
are rational in the weights with subtraction--free denominators, and have
explicit expressions in terms of conservative and edge flows. At boundary
sources the edge vectors give the boundary measurement matrix. If $G$ is
acyclically orientable, all components are subtraction-free rational in the

campaigns of the tidal disruption event (TDE) iPTF16fnl, covering the first
$\sim$100 days after the transient discovery. We followed the source
photometrically until the TDE emission was no longer detected above the host
galaxy light. The bolometric luminosity evolution of the TDE is consistent with
an exponential decay with e-folding constant t$_{0}$=17.6$\pm$0.2 days. The
early time spectra of the transient are dominated by broad He II $\lambda$4686,
H$\beta$, H$\alpha$ and N III $\lambda$4100 emission lines. The latter is known
to be produced together with the N III $\lambda$4640 in the Bowen fluorescence
mechanism. Thanks to the medium resolution X-shooter spectra we have been able
to separate the Bowen blend contribution from the broad He II emission line.
The detection of the Bowen fluorescence lines in iPTF16fnl place this transient
among the N-rich TDE subset. In the late-time X-shooter spectra, narrow
emission lines of [O III] and [N II] originating from the host galaxy are
detected, suggesting that the host galaxy harbours a weak AGN in its core. The
properties of all broad emission lines evolve with time. The equivalent widths
follow an exponential decay compatible with the bolometric luminosity
evolution. The full-width a half maximum of the broad lines decline with time
and the line profiles develop a narrow core at later epochs. Overall, the
optical emission of iPTF16fnl can be explained by being produced in an
optically thick region in which high densities favour the Bowen fluorescence
mechanism and where multiple electron scatterings are responsible for the line
broadening.

forward-backward splitting (NOFOB). The algorithm consists of two steps; first
an evaluation of a nonlinear forward-backward map followed by a relaxed
projection onto the separating hyperplane it constructs. The key of the method
is the nonlinearity in the forward-backward step, where the backward part is
based on a nonlinear resolvent construction that allows for the kernel in the
resolvent to be a nonlinear single-valued maximal monotone operator. This
generalizes the standard resolvent as well as the Bregman resolvent, whose
resolvent kernels are gradients of convex functions. This construction opens up
for a new understanding of many existing operator splitting methods and paves
the way for devising new algorithms. In particular, we present a four-operator
splitting method as a special case of NOFOB that relies nonlinearity and
nonsymmetry in the forward-backward kernel. We show that
forward-backward-forward splitting (FBF), forward-backward-half-forward
splitting (FBHF), asymmetric forward-backward-adjoint splitting (AFBA) with its
many special cases, as well as synchronous projective splitting are special
cases of the four-operator splitting method and hence of NOFOB. We also show
that standard formulations of FB(H)F use smaller relaxations in the projections
than allowed in NOFOB. Besides proving convergence for NOFOB, we show linear
convergence under a metric subregularity assumption, which in a unified manner
shows (in some cases new) linear convergence results for its special cases.

one of the most prominent tools used in anthropology for the study of
non-metric traits. However, one of the problems, in anthropology including
palaeoanthropology (more often there), is the lack of big enough samples or the
existence of samples without sufficiently measured traits. Since 1969, with the
advent of bootstrapping techniques, this issue has been tackled successfully in
many different ways. Here, we present a parametric bootstrap technique based on
the fact that the transformed $ \theta $, obtained from the Anscombe
transformation to stabilize the variance, nearly follows a normal distribution
with zero mean and variance $ \sigma^2 = 1 / (N + 1/2) $, where $ N $ is the
size of the measured trait. When the probabilistic distribution is known,
parametric procedures offer more powerful results than non-parametric ones. We
profit from knowing the probabilistic distribution of $ \theta $ to develop a
parametric bootstrapping method. We explain it carefully with mathematical
support. We give examples, both with artificial data and with real ones. Our
results show that this parametric bootstrap procedure is a powerful tool to
study samples with scarcity of data.

is a relatively new field of research, that until now has been limited to
producing small single-slice images (e.g., 1x128x128). This paper proposes a
novel and more efficient network design for Positron Emission Tomography called
DirectPET which is capable of reconstructing multi-slice image volumes (i.e.,
16x400x400) from sinograms.
  Approach: Large-scale direct neural network reconstruction is accomplished by
addressing the associated memory space challenge through the introduction of a
specially designed Radon inversion layer. Using patient data, we compare the
proposed method to the benchmark Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization
(OSEM) algorithm using signal-to-noise ratio, bias, mean absolute error and
structural similarity measures. In addition, line profiles and full-width
half-maximum measurements are provided for a sample of lesions.
  Results: DirectPET is shown capable of producing images that are
quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the OSEM target images in a
fraction of the time. We also report on an experiment where DirectPET is
trained to map low count raw data to normal count target images demonstrating
the method's ability to maintain image quality under a low dose scenario.
  Conclusion: The ability of DirectPET to quickly reconstruct high-quality,
multi-slice image volumes suggests potential clinical viability of the method.
However, design parameters and performance boundaries need to be fully
established before adoption can be considered.

signals, we design two novel feature transform mechanisms, in both frequency

allow using convolutional neural networks to learn the most discriminative

for the video data, at the video frame and video clip levels, respectively.
Each of the four modalities returns a probability distribution on activity
prediction. Then, these probability distributions are fused to output the
worker activity classification result. A worker activity dataset of 6
activities is established, which at present contains 6 common activities in
assembly tasks, i.e., grab a tool/part, hammer a nail, use a power-screwdriver,
rest arms, turn a screwdriver, and use a wrench. The developed multi-modal

real-time radio-based communication systems such as the Automated Packet
Reporting System (APRS). Prefabricated APRS-compatible tracker modules have
made it trivial to transmit GPS coordinates and payload parameters in
compliance with the requisite AX.25 protocol. However, in order to receive and
track APRS signals, conventional methodologies call for the use of a Very High
Frequency (VHF) receiver to demodulate signals transmitted on the 440/144 MHz
APRS frequencies, along with a compatible antenna and custom methodology for
visualizing the HAB's location on a map. The entire assembly is typically
costly, cumbersome, and may require an internet connection in order to obtain
real-time visualization of the HAB's location. This paper describes a low-cost,
handheld system based on open-source software that operates independently of an
internet connection. The miniaturized system is suited to tracking done either
from a vehicle or on foot, and is cost-effective enough to be within the means
of nearly any HAB user. The paper also discusses preliminary test results and
further applications.

prevalence of drug-susceptible (s) and drug-resistant (m) disease strains. We
model the emergence of drug resistance as a consequence of inadequate
treatment, i.e. amplification. We perform a dynamical analysis of the resulting
system and find that the model contains three equilibrium points: a
disease-free equilibrium; a mono-existent disease-endemic equilibrium with
respect to the drug-resistant strain; and a co-existent disease-endemic
equilibrium where both the drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains persist.
We found two basic reproduction numbers: one associated with the
drug-susceptible strain $R_{0s}$; the other with the drug-resistant strain
$R_{0m}$,and showed that at least one of the strains can spread in a population
if ($R_{0s}$,$R_{0m}$) > 1 (epidemic).Furthermore, we also showed that if
$R_{0m}$ > max($R_{0s}$,1), the drug-susceptible strain dies out but the
drug-resistant strain persists in the population; however if $R_{0s}$ >
max($R_{0m}$,1), then both the drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains
persist in the population. We conducted a local stability analysis of the
system equilibrium points using the Routh-Hurwitz conditions and a global
stability analysis using appropriate Lyapunov functions. Sensitivity analysis
was used to identify the most important model parameters through the partial
rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) method. We found that the contact rate of
both strains had the largest influence on prevalence. We also investigated the
impact of amplification and treatment rates of both strains on the equilibrium
prevalence of infection; results suggest that poor quality treatment make
coexistence more likely but increase the relative abundance of resistant
infections.

differences, known as residuals. In interplanetary orbit determination, Doppler
observables, obtained by measuring the average frequency shift of the received
carrier signal over a certain count time, are compared against their predicted
values, usually computed by differencing two round-trip light-times. This
formulation is known to be sensitive to round-off errors, caused by the use of
finite arithmetic in the computation, giving rise to an additional noise in the
residuals, called numerical noise, that degrades the accuracy of the orbit
determination solution. This paper presents a mathematical model for the
expected numerical errors in two-way and three-way Doppler observables,
computed using the differenced light-time formulation. The model was validated
by comparing its prediction to the actual noise in the computed observables,
obtained by NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Orbit Determination Program. The
model proved to be accurate within $3 \times 10^{-3} \,\text{mm/s}$ at $60

Cassini's and Juno's nominal trajectories, proving that numerical errors can
assume values up to $6 \times 10^{-2} \,\text{mm/s}$ at $60 \,\text{s}$
integration time, and consequently that they are an important noise source in

Accordingly, we consider privacy-preserving SVM computing. We focus on

proposed scheme enables us not only to protect images, but also to have the
same performance as that of unprotected images even when using typical kernel

the boundary of piecewise flat shapes in 3D is introduced. A major class of
examples are triangulated surfaces as they occur for instance in finite element
computations. The analysis of the functional is based on a differential
geometric setting in which the unit normal vector is viewed as an element of
the two-dimensional sphere manifold. It is found to agree with the discrete
total mean curvature known in discrete differential geometry. A split Bregman
iteration is proposed for the solution of discretized shape optimization
problems, in which the total variation of the normal appears as a regularizer.
Unlike most other priors, such as surface area, the new functional allows for
piecewise flat shapes. As two applications, a mesh denoising and a geometric
inverse problem of inclusion detection type involving a partial differential

SrOs$_4$As$_{12}$ with a superconducting transition temperature of $T_{\rm c}$
$\sim$ 4.8 K. Knight shift $K$ determined by the NQR spectrum under a small
magnetic field ($\le$ 0.5 T) is nearly independent of temperature, consistent
with the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility. The nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature, 1/$T_1T$, is nearly
independent of temperature above $\sim$ 50 K and increases slightly with
decreasing temperature below the temperature. The temperature dependence is
reasonably explained by a simple model where a flat band structure with a small
ledge near the Fermi energy is assumed. By comparing the present NMR data with
those in SrFe$_4$As$_{12}$, we found that the values of $|K|$ and $1/T_1T$ in
SrOs$_4$As$_{12}$ are smaller than those in SrFe$_4$As$_{12}$, indicating no
obvious ferromagnetic spin correlations in SrOs$_4$As$_{12}$. From the
temperature dependence of 1/$T_1$ in the superconducting state, an $s$-wave
superconductivity is realized.

compared experimentally for emergency braking with blocked wheel, as well as
using ABS. Data from the three methods were recorded simultaneously. Data

importance of the effects was demonstrated and quantified, showing that there
is still space for developments in this field. However, as the problem becomes

last decade. The objective of NILM is to identify the power consumption of
individual appliances and to detect when particular devices are on or off from
measuring the power consumption of an entire house. This information allows
households to receive customized advice on how to better manage their
electrical consumption. In this paper, we present an alternative NILM method
that breaks down the aggregated power signal into categories of appliances. The
ultimate goal is to use this approach for demand-side management to estimate
potential flexibility within the electricity consumption of households. Our
method is implemented as an algorithm combining NILM and load profile
simulation. This algorithm, based on a Markov model, allocates an activity
chain to each inhabitant of the household, deduces from the whole-house power
measurement and statistical data the appliance usage, generate the power
profile accordingly and finally returns the share of energy consumed by each
appliance category over time. To analyze its performance, the algorithm was
benchmarked against several state-of-the-art NILM algorithms and tested on
three public datasets. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised; hence it does
not require any labeled data, which are expensive to acquire. Although better
performance is shown for the supervised algorithms, our proposed unsupervised
algorithm achieves a similar range of uncertainty while saving on the cost of
acquiring labeled data. Additionally, our method requires lower computational
power compared to most of the tested NILM algorithms. It was designed for
low-sampling-rate power measurement (every 15 min), which corresponds to the
frequency range of most common smart meters.

Cartesian mental causation since the 1690s. Modern discussions of the topic
tend to use mid-19th century physics, neglecting both locality and Noether's
theorem and its converse. The relevance of General Relativity (GR) has rarely
been considered. But a few authors have proposed that the non-localizability of
gravitational energy and consequent lack of physically meaningful local
conservation laws answers the conservation objection to mental causation:
conservation already fails in GR, so there is nothing for minds to violate.
  This paper is motivated by two ideas. First, one might take seriously the
fact that GR formally has an infinity of rigid symmetries of the action and
hence, by Noether's first theorem, an infinity of conserved energies-momenta
(thus answering Schr\""{o}dinger's 1918 false-negative objection). Second, Sean
Carroll has asked (rhetorically) how one should modify the
Dirac-Maxwell-Einstein equations to describe mental causation. This paper uses
the generalized Bianchi identities to show that General Relativity tends to
exclude, not facilitate, such Cartesian mental causation. In the simplest case,
Cartesian mental influence must be spatio-temporally constant, and hence 0. The
difficulty may diminish for more complicated models. Its persuasiveness is also
affected by larger world-view considerations.
  The new general relativistic objection provides some support for realism
about gravitational energy-momentum in GR (taking pseudotensor laws seriously).
Such realism also answers an objection to theories of causation involving
conserved quantities, because energies-momenta would be conserved even in GR.

i.e., the problem of constructing low-dimensional information preserving
embeddings of multi-view networks. Specifically, we investigate a novel
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for Multi-View Network
Embedding, namely MEGAN, aimed at preserving the information from the
individual network views, while accounting for connectivity across (and hence

like specially designed meta paths. In this paper, we propose two novel
algorithms, GHINE (General Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding) and
AHINE (Adaptive Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding), to compute
distributed representations for elements in heterogeneous networks. Specially,
AHINE uses an adaptive deep model to learn network embeddings that maximizes
the likelihood of preserving the relationship chains between non-adjacent

$f:V(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,2,3\}$ having the property that for each vertex $v$

$\gamma_{dR}(G)$ is the minimum weight $f(V(G))=\sum_{v\in V(G)}f(v)$ among all

  In this work, we present some contributions to the study of outer independent
double Roman domination in graphs. Characterizations of the families of all
connected graphs with small outer independent double Roman domination numbers,

this parameter for a tree $T$ from below by two times the vertex cover number
