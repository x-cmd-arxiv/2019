  Trade-off",,,,,"stat.OT cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A two-terminal distributed binary hypothesis testing problem over a noisy
channel is studied. The two terminals, called the observer and the decision
maker, each has access to $n$ independent and identically distributed samples,
denoted by $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$, respectively. The observer
communicates to the decision maker over a discrete memoryless channel, and the
decision maker performs a binary hypothesis test on the joint probability
distribution of $(\mathbf{U},\mathbf{V})$ based on $\mathbf{V}$ and the noisy
information received from the observer. The trade-off between the exponents of
the type I and type II error probabilities is investigated. Two inner bounds
are obtained, one using a separation-based scheme that involves type-based
compression and unequal error-protection channel coding, and the other using a
joint scheme that incorporates type-based hybrid coding. The separation-based
scheme is shown to recover the inner bound obtained by Han and Kobayashi for
the special case of a rate-limited noiseless channel, and also the one obtained
by the authors previously for a corner point of the trade-off. Finally, we show
via an example that the joint scheme achieves a strictly tighter bound than the
separation-based scheme for some points of the error-exponents trade-off.

Furthermore, we show that two inhibitory populations in a master-slave

bidirectionally coupled the two inhibitory populations can exhibit different
types of theta-gamma cross-frequency couplings (CFCs): namely, phase-phase and

quantum circuit that evolves a product state to the targeted MPS with a high

and heavily relies on intuition of researchers through a trial-and-error
process. The massive combinational spaces due to the constituent elements and
their structural configurations are too overwhelming to be all searched even by
high-throughput computations. Herein, we demonstrated a novel regressional
generative adversarial network (RGAN) for inverse design of representative
two-dimensional materials, graphene and boron-nitride (BN) hybrids. A
significant novelty of the proposed RGAN is that it combines the supervised and
regressional convolutional neural network (CNN) with the traditional
unsupervised GAN, thus overcoming the common technical barrier in the
traditional GANs, which cannot generate data associated with given continuous
quantitative labels. The proposed RGAN enables to autonomously generate
graphene/BN hybrids with any given bandgaps. Moreover, the generated structures
exhibit high fidelity, yielding bandgaps within ~ 10% MAEF of the desired
bandgaps as cross-validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Further analysis by principle component analysis (PCA) and modified locally
linear embedding (MLLE) methods on the latent features encoded by the regressor
reveals that the generator has successfully generated structures that followed
the statistical distribution of the real structures. It implies the possibility
of the RGAN in recognizing physical rules hidden in the high-dimensional data.
This new inverse design methodology would speed up the discovery and
development of other 2D materials and beyond.

  distribution: predictions and an empirical test",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ecological selection is a major driver of community assembly. Selection is
classified as stabilizing when species with intermediate trait values gain the
highest reproductive success, whereas selection is considered directional when
fitness is highest for species with extreme trait values. Previous studies have
investigated the effects of different selection types on trait distribution,
but the effects of selection on species diversity have remained unclear. Here,
we propose a framework for inferring the type and strength of selection by
studying species diversity and trait distribution together against null
expectations. We use a simulation model to confirm our prediction that
directional selection should lead to lower species diversity than stabilizing
selection despite a similar effect on trait community-weighted variance. We
apply the framework to a mesocosm system of annual plants to test whether
differences in species diversity between two habitats that vary in productivity
are related to differences in selection on seed mass. We show that, in both
habitats, species diversity was lower than the null expectation, but that
species diversity was lower in the more productive habitat. We attribute this
difference to strong directional selection for large-seeded species in the
productive habitat as indicated by trait community-weighted-mean being higher
and community-weighted variance being lower than the null expectations. In the
less productive habitat, we found that community-weighted variance was higher
than expected by chance, suggesting that seed mass could be a driver of niche
partitioning under such conditions. Altogether, our results suggest that
viewing species diversity and trait distribution as interrelated patterns
driven by the same process, ecological selection, is helpful in understanding
community assembly.

the subjective magnitude of one's experience. We do this in the context of the

judgments of the form: ""Is stimulus S_i more similar to stimulus S_j or to
stimulus S_k?"". We propose to use ordinal embedding methods from machine
learning to estimate the scaling function from the relative judgments. We
review two relevant and well-known methods in psychophysics which are partially
applicable in our setting: non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) and the
method of maximum likelihood difference scaling (MLDS). We perform an extensive
set of simulations, considering various scaling functions, to demonstrate the
performance of the ordinal embedding methods. We show that in contrast to
existing approaches our ordinal embedding approach allows, first, to obtain
reasonable scaling function from comparatively few relative judgments, second,
the estimation of non-monotonous scaling functions, and, third,
multi-dimensional perceptual scales. In addition to the simulations, we analyse
data from two real psychophysics experiments using ordinal embedding methods.
Our results show that in the one-dimensional, monotonically increasing
perceptual scale our ordinal embedding approach works as well as MLDS, while in
higher dimensions, only our ordinal embedding methods can produce a desirable
scaling function. To make our methods widely accessible, we provide an

  Several criteria exist for measuring pairwise dissimilarities among
categorical sequences. Typically, dissimilarity matrices are employed as input
to heuristic clustering algorithms. The family of methods we develop instead
clusters sequences directly using mixtures of exponential-distance models.
Basing the models on weighted variants of the Hamming distance metric permits
closed-form expressions for parameter estimation. Simultaneously allowing the
component membership probabilities to depend on fixed covariates and
accommodating sampling weights in the clustering process yields new insights on
the Northern Irish data. In particular, we find that school examination

causes the browser to render a graphic recording rendering statistics as a
unique identifier. In this work, we observe how indirect device fingerprinting
methods are disclosed in privacy policies, and consider whether the disclosures
are sufficient to enable website visitors to block the tracking methods. We
compare these disclosures to the disclosure of direct fingerprinting methods on
the same websites.
  Our case study analyzes one indirect fingerprinting technique, Canvas
fingerprinting. We use an existing automated detector of this fingerprinting
technique to conservatively detect its use on Alexa Top 500 websites that cater
to United States consumers, and we examine the privacy policies of the
resulting 28 websites. Disclosures of indirect fingerprinting vary in
specificity. None described the specific methods with enough granularity to
know the website used Canvas fingerprinting. Conversely, many sites did provide
enough detail about usage of direct fingerprinting methods to allow a website
visitor to reliably detect and block those techniques.
  We conclude that indirect fingerprinting methods are often difficult to
detect and are not identified with specificity in privacy policies. This makes
indirect fingerprinting more difficult to block, and therefore risks disturbing
the tentative armistice between individuals and websites currently in place for
direct fingerprinting. This paper illustrates differences in fingerprinting

requests in parallel. Unfortunately, if two requests go to the same bank, they
have to be served one after another, leading to lower system performance. We
observe that a modern PCM bank is implemented as a collection of partitions
that operate mostly independently while sharing a few global peripheral
structures, which include the sense amplifiers (to read) and the write drivers
(to write). Based on this observation, we propose PALP, a new mechanism that
enables partition-level parallelism within each PCM bank, and exploits such
parallelism by using the memory controller's access scheduling decisions. PALP
consists of three new contributions. First, we introduce new PCM commands to
enable parallelism in a bank's partitions in order to resolve the read-write
bank conflicts, with minimal changes needed to PCM logic and its interface.
Second, we propose simple circuit modifications that introduce a new operating
mode for the write drivers, in addition to their default mode of serving write
requests. When configured in this new mode, the write drivers can resolve the
read-read bank conflicts, working jointly with the sense amplifiers. Finally,
we propose a new access scheduling mechanism in PCM that improves performance
by prioritizing those requests that exploit partition-level parallelism over
other requests, including the long outstanding ones. While doing so, the memory
controller also guarantees starvation-freedom and the PCM's
running-average-power-limit (RAPL). We evaluate PALP with workloads from the
MiBench and SPEC CPU2017 Benchmark suites. Our results show that PALP reduces
average PCM access latency by 23%, and improves average system performance by
28% compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

injected by attackers to manipulate the underlying data and alter the impact of
resulting recommendations, thus implementing a so-called shilling attack. While
previous works have focused on evaluating shilling attack strategies from a
global perspective paying particular attention to the effect of the size of

shilling attacks under novel aspects. First, we investigate the effect of
attack strategies crafted on a target user in order to push the recommendation

sharp edges to sustain non-wetting (Cassie-Baxter) equilibrium states. Gibbs
already pointed out that equilibrium is possible as long as the pinning angle
at the edge falls between the equilibrium contact angles corresponding to the
flanks of the edge. However, the lack of stability can restrict further the
realizable equilibrium configurations. To find these limits we analyze here the
equilibrium and stability of two-dimensional drops bounded by interfaces pinned
on mathematically sharp edges. We are specifically interested on how the drop's
stability depends on its size, which is measured with the Bond number $Bo =
(\mathcal{W}_d/\ell_c)^2$, defined as the ratio of the drop's characteristic
length scale $\mathcal{W}_d$ to the capillary length $\ell_c =
\sqrt{\sigma/\rho g}$. Drops with a fixed volume become more stable as they
shrink in size. On the contrary, open drops, i.e. capable of exchanging mass
with a reservoir, are less stable as their associated Bond number decreases.

geometrically confined particles, such as a nanorod that can represent diatomic

can be modeled as a solid particle shows a strikingly different response, where
RDH appears in a frequency regime close to their resonances, while a detuned
frequency produces cooling of rotation. We also predict that the RDH effect can
lead to unprecedented spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, whereby an achiral
particle under linearly polarized illumination starts spontaneously rotating,
rendering it nontrivial compared to the translational Doppler effect. Our
results open up new exciting possibilities to control the rotational motion of

example, for the oximetry comparison study that motivates our research, FDA has
clear guidelines approving an investigational pulse oximeter in comparison to a
standard oximeter via testing the root mean squares (RMS), a composite measure
of both mean and variance parameters. For the hypothesis testing of this
composite measure, existing methods have been either exploratory or relying on
the large-sample normal approximation with conservative and unsatisfactory

well-controlled type I error and favorable performance in our extensive

factorization of large matrices during the solution of stiff systems of ODEs.
Starting from the general form of an explicit linear multistep method we
suggest to adaptively choose its coefficients on each integration step in order
to minimize the norm of the residual of an implicit BDF formula. Thereby we
reduce the number of unknowns on each step from $n$ to $O(1)$, where $n$ is the
dimension of the ODE system. We call this type of methods Minimal Residual
Multistep (MRMS) methods. In the case of linear non-autonomous problem, besides
the evaluations of the right-hand side of ODE, the resulting numerical scheme
additionally requires one solution of a linear least-squares problem with a
thin matrix per step. We show that the order of the method and its
zero-stability properties coincide with those of the used underlying BDF
formula. For the simplest analog of the implicit Euler method the properties of
linear stability are investigated. Though the classical absolute stability
analysis is not fully relevant to the MRMS methods, it is shown that this
one-step method is applicable in stiff case. In the numerical experiment
section we consider the fixed-step integration of a two-dimensional
non-autonomous heat equation using the MRMS methods and their classical BDF
counterparts. The starting values are taken from a preset slowly-varying exact
solution. The comparison showed that both methods give similar numerical
solutions, but in the case of large systems the MRMS methods are faster, and
their advantage considerably increases with the growth of dimension. Python

69 as WTT objects. The fraction of the variables in these samples is about 60%.
We also identified 20 stellar objects, which showed not only a significant
variability of the equivalent width, but which also change their apparent
evolutionary stage.
  The analysis of data obtained over a wide wavelength range (from X-ray to
mid-infrared) has shown that Ha activity and the measure of its variability are
in good agreement with the activity of stellar objects measured with its other
parameters, such as X-ray radiation and the mass accretion rate. The EW(Ha)
differs not only between objects at different evolutionary stages, but also
between variable and non-variable objects. The variables in the CTT and WTT
samples are more active than non-variables although they have almost the same
evolutionary age. Another distinct difference between these variables and
non-variables is their average masses. The variables from both CTT and WTT
samples are noticeably more massive than non-variables. Our data confirm the
assumption made for other star formation regions, that the decay of accretion
activity occurs more slowly for more massive CTT objects. Apparently, a similar
trend is also present in WTT objects, which are at a later stage of evolution.
The variability of the stellar objects, which change their evolutionary
classes, at least in a fraction of them, is due to the fact that they are close
binaries, which affects and modulates their Ha emission activity.

unit cell comprising a vertically-oriented asymmetric slot-waveguide. The unit
cell shows oscillating unidirectional scattering behavior that can be precisely

between multiple modes excited by the incident light. In contrast to
metasurface-based gratings with multiple resonant sub-elements, a periodic

such polarons significantly suppresses dissociation of water molecules that are
bonded directly to polaronic sites. On the other hand, polarons facilitate
water dissociation at certain non-polaronic sites. Furthermore, polarons
strengthen hydrogen bonds, which in turn affects water dissociation in hydrogen

traditionally accomplished by distributing clocks and triggers via dedicated

dedicated to the measurement of radioactive gases at low activity and consists
of eight large silicon pixels and two NaI(Tl) detectors, instrumented with a

coincidences will make it possible to identify each radioisotope present in the

spectrum. Using two independent families of models, the intrinsic spectrum from
the central engine is found to be highly obscured but not Compton-thick.
Enforcing physical self-consistency within each model, the independent
treatments give formally consistent results: N_H = 2.67 (-0.03,+0.02) E+23
cm^-2 or N_H = 2.64 (-0.03, +0.03) E+23 cm^-2. Past measurements made with
Suzaku and XMM-Newton are in broad agreement with these column density values.
A more recent measurement with NuSTAR (in late 2013) recorded a column density
about twice as large; the robustness of this variability is reinforced by the
use of consistent models and procedures. The neutral Fe K-alpha line in the
NICER spectrum is nominally resolved and consistent with an origin in the
optical broad line region (BLR). The data also require ionized absorption in
the Fe K band, similar to the ""warm absorbers"" detected in Seyfert-1 active
galactic nuclei (AGN). The low-energy spectrum is consistent with a set of
ionized plasma components. We discuss these findings and note that the
geometric inferences that derive from this analysis can be tested with XRISM

relativistic plasmas that are heated by turbulent cascades and cooled by
emission of radiation. Understanding the nature of this radiative turbulence is
a frontier of extreme plasma astrophysics. In this paper, we use
particle-in-cell simulations to study the effects of external inverse Compton
radiation on turbulence driven in an optically thin, relativistic pair plasma.
We focus on the statistical steady state (where injected energy is balanced by
radiated energy) and perform a parameter scan spanning from low magnetization
to high magnetization ($0.04 \lesssim \sigma \lesssim 11$). We demonstrate that
the global particle energy distributions are quasi-thermal in all simulations,
with only a modest population of nonthermal energetic particles (extending the
tail by a factor of $\sim 2$). This indicates that nonthermal particle
acceleration (observed in similar non-radiative simulations) is quenched by
strong radiative cooling. The quasi-thermal energy distributions are well fit
by analytic models in which stochastic particle acceleration (due to, e.g.,
second-order Fermi mechanism or gyroresonant interactions) is balanced by the
radiation reaction force. Despite the efficient thermalization of the plasma,
nonthermal energetic particles do make a conspicuous appearance in the
anisotropy of the global momentum distribution as highly variable, intermittent
beams (for high magnetization cases). The beamed high-energy particles are
spatially coincident with intermittent current sheets, suggesting that
localized magnetic reconnection may be a mechanism for kinetic beaming. This
beaming phenomenon may explain rapid flares observed in various astrophysical
systems (such as blazar jets, the Crab nebula, and Sagittarius A*).

to fully constrain: 1. Bi-adjoint doubly-ordered amplitudes, assuming locality;
2. NLSM and BI, assuming locality and unitarity; 3. Special Galileon, assuming
locality, unitarity, and a UV bound for the general Galileon vertex. We see how
potentially distinct aspects of this UV behavior can be understood and unified
via double-copy relations. Surprisingly, we find evidence that assuming
unitarity for these theories may not be necessary, and can emerge via UV
considerations and locality alone. These results complete the observations
that, like IR considerations, UV scaling is sufficient to fully constrain a
wide range of tree-level amplitudes, for both gauge, gravity, and effective
field theories.

which modifies sentiment attributes (e.g., positive or negative) of sentences
while preserving their attribute-independent content. Due to the limited
capability of RNNbased encoder-decoder structure to capture deep and long-range
dependencies among words, previous works can hardly generate satisfactory
sentences from scratch. When humans convert the sentiment attribute of a
sentence, a simple but effective approach is to only replace the original
sentimental tokens in the sentence with target sentimental expressions, instead
of building a new sentence from scratch. Such a process is very similar to the
task of Text Infilling or Cloze, which could be handled by a deep bidirectional
Masked Language Model (e.g. BERT). So we propose a two step approach ""Mask and
Infill"". In the mask step, we separate style from content by masking the
positions of sentimental tokens. In the infill step, we retrofit MLM to
Attribute Conditional MLM, to infill the masked positions by predicting words
or phrases conditioned on the context1 and target sentiment. We evaluate our
model on two review datasets with quantitative, qualitative, and human
evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that our models improve
state-of-the-art performance.

variance of the enhanced speech with even the same cosine similarity loss in
high dimensional space, a deep neural network learnt with this loss might not
be able to predict enhanced speech with good quality. Our coarse-to-fine
strategy optimizes the cosine similarity loss for different granularities so
that more constraints are added to the prediction from high dimension to
relatively low dimension. In this way, the enhanced speech will better resemble
the clean speech. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed
coarse-to-fine optimization in both discriminative models and generative

which dynamically computes the adversarial loss from coarse resolution to fine

We present models of the time-evolving chemistry of gas-phase water during
X-ray flaring events. The chemistry is modeled at point locations in the disk
between 1 and 50 au at vertical heights ranging from the mid-plane to the
surface. We find that strong, rare flares, i.e., those that increase the
unattenuated X-ray ionization rate by a factor of 100 every few years, can
temporarily increase the gas-phase water abundance relative to H can by more
than a factor of $\sim3-5$ along the disk surface (Z/R $\ge$ 0.3). We report
that a ""typical"" flare, i.e., those that increase the unattenuated X-ray
ionization rate by a factor of a few every few weeks, will not lead to
significant, observable changes. Dissociative recombination of H$_3$O$^+$,
water adsorption and desorption onto dust grains, and ultraviolet photolysis of
water and related species are found to be the three dominant processes
regulating the gas-phase water abundance. While the changes are found to be
significant, we find that the effect on gas phase water abundances throughout
the disk is short-lived (days). Even though we do not see a substantial
increase in long term water (gas and ice) production, the flares' large effects

different structural and stellar-population properties for 12,000 SDSS central

from this large sample. Structural parameters show fairly linear log-log

moderate scatter, while stellar-population parameters show a highly non-linear
""elbow"" in which specific star-formation rate remains roughly flat with
increasing central density and then falls rapidly at the elbow, where galaxies
begin to quench. P-bulges occupy the low-density end of the horizontal arm of
the elbow and are universally star-forming, while C-bulges occupy the elbow and
the vertical branch and exhibit a wide range of star-formation rates at fixed
density. The non-linear relation between central density and star-formation
rate has been seen before, but this mapping onto bulge class is new. The wide
range of star-formation rates in C-bulges helps to explain why bulge
classifications using different parameters have sometimes disagreed in the

that central structure and stellar-populations evolve at different rates as

Previous studies have struggled to deduce the identity of their progenitors due
to a combination of their extremely extended radial distributions with respect
to their host galaxies and their relatively high rate of occurrence. In this
work, we find that the CaST radial distribution is consistent with the radial
distribution of two populations of stars: old (ages > 5 Gyr), low-metallicity
(Z/Zsol < 0.3) stars and globular clusters. While no obvious progenitor
scenario arises from considering old, metal-poor stars, the alternative
production site of globular clusters leads us to narrow down the list of
possible candidates to three binary scenarios: mergers of helium and
oxygen/neon white dwarfs; tidal disruptions of helium white dwarfs by neutron
stars; and stable accretion from low-mass helium-burning stars onto white
dwarfs. While rare in the field, these binary systems can be formed dynamically
at much higher rates in globular clusters. Subsequent binary hardening both
increases their interaction rate and ejects them from their parent globular
clusters prior to mass transfer contact. Their production in, and ejection
from, globular clusters may explain their radial distribution and the absence
of globular clusters at their explosion site. This model predicts a currently
undiscovered high rate of CaSTs in nuclear star clusters. Alternatively, an
undetermined progenitor scenario involving old, low-metallicity stars may
instead hold the key to understanding CaSTs.

significant in cross-correlation of CMB lensing with LSST galaxies, and
comparable to the statistical uncertainty in CMB lensing auto-spectrum. We
discuss various mitigation strategies, and show that ""lensed foreground

First of all, we show that this mapping is independent of the couplings, and
that for $h=0$ it is possible to perform a low temperature expansion as a

a propagator for a complex field. The combinatorial nature of the partition

a dereddened flux density of $3.4$ mJy. Furthermore, the flat power spectral

(developed independently by Izmaylov et al. [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 190

additional unitary operations are appended to the ansatz preparation to reduce
the number of terms. This approach may be scaled to use all coherent resources

qubitization to implement the additional coherent operations with lower circuit
depth. We investigate this technique for lattice Hamiltonians, random Pauli
Hamiltonians, and electronic structure Hamiltonians. Using this technique, we
find a constant factor speedup for lattice and random Pauli Hamiltonians. For
electronic structure Hamiltonians, we prove that linear term reduction with
respect to the number of orbitals, which has been previously observed in
numerical studies, is always achievable. For systems represented on 10--30
qubits, we find that there is a reduction in the number of terms by
approximately an order of magnitude. Applied to the plane-wave dual basis
representation of fermionic Hamiltonians, however, unitary partitioning offers
only a constant factor reduction. Finally, we show that noncontextual

how given the prior distribution, learning the conditional distribution of PET
given the MRI image reduces to obtaining the conditional distribution between
the two latent codes w.r.t. the two image types. We also extend our framework
to leverage 'side' information (or attributes) when available. By controlling
the PET generation through 'conditioning' on age, our model is also able to
capture brain FDG-PET (hypometabolism) changes, as a function of age. We
present experiments on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)

qualitatively and quantitatively better than recent works.

  chattering, limit cycles and convergence to optimality","16 pages, 9 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Load side participation can provide valuable support to the power network in
case of urgencies. On many occasions, loads are naturally represented by on and
off states. However, the use of on-off loads for frequency control can lead to
chattering and undesirable limit cycle behavior, which are issues that need to
be resolved for such loads to be used for network support. This paper considers
the problem of primary frequency regulation with ancillary service from on-off
loads in power networks and establishes conditions that lead to convergence
guarantees and an appropriate power allocation within the network. In
particular, in order to assist existing frequency control mechanisms, we
consider loads that switch when prescribed frequency thresholds are exceeded.
Such control policies are prone to chattering, which limits their practicality.
To resolve this issue, we consider loads that follow a decentralized hysteretic
on-off policy, and show that chattering is not observed within such a setting.
Hysteretic loads may exhibit, however, limit cycle behavior, which is
undesirable. To address this, we propose an adapted hysteretic control scheme
for which we provide convergence guarantees. Furthermore, we consider a
mixed-integer optimization problem for power allocation and propose a suitable
design of the control policy such that the cost incurred at equilibrium is
within $\epsilon$ from the optimal cost, providing a non conservative value for
$\epsilon$. The practicality of our analytic results is demonstrated with
numerical simulations on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC)
140-bus system.

interfacial surface area for bacteria to degrade insoluble hydrocarbons in the

microscale interactions between bacteria and oil droplets, particularly the
encounters between these elements that are required for degradation to occur.
This chapter discusses a biophysical model for hydrocarbon consumption of
suspended oil droplets under conditions of rapid dilution that occur in natural
environments. Based on the model, which includes typical biological growth
parameters, dilution is found to produce an effective delay in the onset of
biodegradation by approximately a week. The steady and rapid reduction in oil
concertation, due to dilution, is found to outpace the production of
oil-degrading bacteria that result from colonization of degrading oil droplets,
maintaining the process in an encounter-limited state. This mechanistic model
provides a baseline for better understanding of microscale biodegradation in
dilute oil environments and can help inform the design of mitigation strategies
in marine systems.

identify the bona-fide blazars. We classified the sources based on the shape of
their Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) and, in particular, on the flatness
of the X-ray emission and its intensity compared to the optical one. We then
compared these high-z blazars with a blazar sample selected at lower redshifts
(z~1). We found a significant difference in the X-ray-to-radio luminosity
ratios, with the CLASS blazars having a mean ratio 2.4+/-0.5 times larger than
low-z blazars. We tentatively interpret this evolution as due to the
interaction of the electrons of the jet with the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) photons, which is expected to boost the observed X-ray emission at high
redshifts. Such a dependence has been already observed in highly radio-loud
AGNs in the recent literature. This is the first time it is observed using a
statistically complete radio flux limited sample of blazars. We have then

Stochastic parameters also drive the interactions. Our analytical and numerical

the transition can be suppressed for sufficiently high group pressure. Such
transition separates two phases: for any $\lambda \leq \lambda_{c}$, the order
parameter $O$ is identically null ($O=0$, a symmetric, absorbing phase), while
for $\lambda>\lambda_{c}$, we have $O>0$, i.e., a symmetry-broken phase

the discrepancies seen between solar coronal density measurements using the Fe

Although there have recently emerged some tests for graph inference based on

a paired test of matrix graphs to infer brain connectivity network when the
groups of samples are correlated. The proposed test statistic is both bias
corrected and variance corrected, and achieves a small estimation error rate.
The subsequent multiple testing procedure built on this test statistic is
guaranteed to asymptotically control the false discovery rate at the

considerably different from the two independent samples framework, owing to the
strong correlations of measurements on the same subjects before and after the

shadows, the common interpretation of which was initiated by Dyudina et al.

cloud walls, analogous to the physically and optically thick eyewalls of a

Icarus, doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.113398), in conjunction with Monte Carlo
calculations and physical models, to show that this interpretation is almost
certainly wrong because (1) optically thick eyewalls should produce very bright
features in the poleward direction that are not seen, while the moderately
brighter features that are seen appear in the opposite direction, (2) eyewall
shadows should be very dark, but the observed shadows create only 5-10\% I/F
variations, (3) radiation transfer modeling of clouds in this region have
detected no optically thick wall clouds and no significant variation in
pressures of the model cloud layers, and (4) there is an alternative
explanation that is much more consistent with observations. The most plausible
scenario is that the shadows near 87.9 deg S and 88.9 deg S are both cast by
overlying translucent aerosol layers from edges created by step decreases in
their optical depths, the first in the stratospheric layer at the 50 mbar level
and the second in a putative diphosphine layer near 350 mbar, with optical
depths reduced at the poleward side of each step by 0.15 and 0.12 respectively
at 752 nm. These steps are sufficient to create shadows of roughly the correct
size and shape, falling mainly on the underlying ammonia ice layer near 900
mbar, and to create the bright features we call antishadows.

multitude of these applications typically also involve datasets that are
distributed across multiple computing devices/machines due to either design
constraints (e.g., multiagent systems) or computational/privacy reasons (e.g.,
learning on smartphone data). Such applications often require the learning
tasks to be carried out in a decentralized fashion, in which there is no
central server that is directly connected to all nodes. In real-world
decentralized settings, nodes are prone to undetected failures due to
malfunctioning equipment, cyberattacks, etc., which are likely to crash
non-robust learning algorithms. The focus of this paper is on robustification
of decentralized learning in the presence of nodes that have undergone
Byzantine failures. The Byzantine failure model allows faulty nodes to
arbitrarily deviate from their intended behaviors, thereby ensuring designs of
the most robust of algorithms. But the study of Byzantine resilience within
decentralized learning, in contrast to distributed learning, is still in its
infancy. In particular, existing Byzantine-resilient decentralized learning
methods either do not scale well to large-scale machine learning models, or
they lack statistical convergence guarantees that help characterize their
generalization errors. In this paper, a scalable, Byzantine-resilient
decentralized machine learning framework termed Byzantine-resilient
decentralized gradient descent (BRIDGE) is introduced. Algorithmic and
statistical convergence guarantees for one variant of BRIDGE are also provided
in the paper for both strongly convex problems and a class of nonconvex
problems. In addition, large-scale decentralized learning experiments are used
to establish that the BRIDGE framework is scalable and it delivers competitive
results for Byzantine-resilient convex and nonconvex learning.

from rotating stars to crystal structures. These behaviors are composed of
simple collective motions of particles which move with the same frequency and
phase, thus encapsulating many-body effects into simple dynamic motions. In
regimes such as the unitary regime for ultracold Fermi gases, a single
collective mode can dominate, leading to simple behavior as seen in
superfluidity. I investigate the evolution of collective motion as a function
of N for five types of normal modes obtained from an L=0 group theoretic
solution of a general Hamiltonian for confined, identical particles. I show
using simple analytic forms that the collective behavior of few-body systems,
with the well known motions of molecular equivalents such as ammonia and
methane, evolves smoothly to the collective motions expected for large N
ensembles. The transition occurs at quite low values of N. I study a
Hamiltonian known to support collective behavior, the Hamiltonian for Fermi
gases in the unitary regime. I analyze the evolution of both frequencies and
the coefficients that mix the radial and angular coordinates which both depend
on interparticle interactions. This analysis reveals two phenomena that could
contribute to the viability of collective behavior. First the mixing
coefficients go to zero or unity, i.e. no mixing, as N becomes large resulting
in solutions that do not depend on the details of the interparticle potential
as expected for this unitary regime, and that manifest the symmetry of an
underlying approximate Hamiltonian. Second, the five normal mode frequencies
which are all close for low values of N, separate as N increases, creating
large gaps that can, in principle, offer stability to collective behavior if
mechanisms to prevent the transfer of energy to other modes exist (such as low
temperature) or can be constructed.

this approach involves simple measurement protocols that assess PL contrast
with and without the application of microwaves. The method is demonstrated to

of less than 10 attomol over a 100 micron x 100 micron field of view. Real time
monitoring of changes in the concentration of paramagnetic salts is
demonstrated with image exposure times of 20 ms. Further, dynamic tracking of
chemical reactions is demonstrated via the conversion of low spin cyanide
coordinated Fe3+ to hexaaqua Fe3+ under acidic conditions. Finally, the
capability to map paramagnetic species in model cells with sub-cellular

duality, we define an operation called cotranslation, and show that the
operation of perspective projection can be written in this Clifford algebra as
a composition of the translation and cotranslation operations. We also show
that the operation of pseudo-perspective can be implemented using the
cotranslation operation. An important point is that the expression for the
operations of reflection and rotation in $\mathcal{C}\ell_{3,3}$ preserve the
subspaces that can be associated with the algebras $\mathcal{C}\ell_{3,0}$ and
$\mathcal{C}\ell_{0,3}$, so that reflection and rotation can be expressed in

However, all other operations mix those subspaces in such a way that they need
to be expressed in terms of the full Clifford algebra $\mathcal{C}\ell_{3,3}$.
An essential aspect of our formulation is the representation of points in terms
of objects called paravectors. Paravectors have been used previously to
represents points in terms of an algebra closely related to the Clifford

sorting algorithms become asymptotically, the less efficient they are for small
sets of items due to large constant factor. This thesis aims to determine if
there is a faster way to sort base case sizes than using insertion sort. For
that we looked at sorting networks and how to implement them efficiently.
Because sorting networks need to be implemented explicitly for each input size,
providing networks for larger sizes becomess less efficient. That is why we
modified Super Scalar Sample Sort to break down larger sets into sizes that can
in turn be sorted by sorting networks. We show that the task of sorting only
small sets can be greatly improved by at least 25% when using sorting networks
compared to insertion sort, but that when integrating them into other sorting
algorithms the speed-up is hindered by the limited L1 instruction cache size.

improvement when using sorting networks as a base case sorter instead of

iron pnictides, here the spin waves exhibit a small but resolvable intrinsic
width, consistent with our theoretical analysis. The subtle manifestation of
spin-fermion coupling is a consequence of the Dirac nature of the conduction
electrons, including the vanishing density of states near the Dirac points.
Accounting for the Dirac fermion dispersion specific to \ymb\ leads to
particular signatures, such as the nearly wave-vector independent damping
observed in the experiment.

hexagonal plastic scintillator bars for detecting antineutrinos from a nuclear

provides compactness. The proposed detector detects antineutrinos via inverse
beta decay (IBD) with the prompt-delayed double coincidence. Owing to its
segmented structure, the background, which satisfies the delayed coincidence
condition can be eliminated by applying proper event selection cuts. In this
manner, the main focus is to determine proper selection criteria to precisely
tag the true IBD events. Monte-Carlo simulation is carried out to understand
the characteristic of the IBD interaction in the proposed detector by using
Geant4 toolkit. A set of event selection criteria is established based on the
simulated data. It is found that a detection efficiency of 10 % can be achieved
with the selection condition applied. It is also shown that fast neutrons,
which constitute the main background source for above-ground detection, can be
effectively eliminated with these selection criteria. The motivation for this
study is to install this compact detector at a short distance (<100 m) from the
Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, which is expected to start operation in 2023.

the difference in the correlation properties between the instantaneous and
delayed targets may be small. Moreover, the reliability of discrimination is
affected by speckle, which is ubiquitous in SAR images, and requires
statistical treatment.
  Previously, we have developed a maximum likelihood based approach for
discriminating between the instantaneous and delayed targets in SAR images. To
test it, we employed simple statistical models. They allowed us to simulate
ensembles of images that depend on various parameters, including aperture width
and target contrast.
  In the current paper, we enhance our previously developed methodology by
establishing confidence levels for the discrimination between the instantaneous

$N_1$-dominated scenario ($N_1$DS) in the `two flavour regime' of leptogenesis,
we show that one may choose the right-handed (RH) neutrino mass hierarchy as
mild as $M_2\simeq 4.7 M_1$ for a perfectly valid hierarchical $N_1$DS. This in
turn reduces the lower bound on the allowed values of $M_1$, compared to what
is stated in the literature. The consideration of flavour effects due to the
heavy neutrinos also translate into an upper bound on $M_1$. It is only below
this bound that the observed baryon-to-photon ratio can be realized for a
standard ${ N_1}$ domination, else a substantial part of the parameter space is
also compatible with $N_2$DS. We deduce conditions under which the baryon
asymmetry produced by the second RH neutrino plays an important role. Finally,
we discuss another interesting scenario where lepton asymmetry generated by
$N_2$ in the two flavour regime faces washout by $N_1$ in the three flavour
regime. Considering a hierarchical light neutrino mass spectrum, which is now
favoured by cosmological observations, we show that at the end of
$N_1$-leptogenesis, the asymmetry generated by $N_2$ survives only in the
electron flavour and around $33\%$ of the parameter space is consistent with a
pure $N_2$-leptogenesis.

detects the seizure from the electroencephalography (EEG) signal using a
hyper-synchronous signal detection circuit and a signal rejection algorithm
(SRA). In the second stage, the drug is released in the seizure onset area upon
seizure detection. The design was validated using a system-level simulation and
consumer electronics proof of concept. The proposed seizure detector reports a
sensitivity of 96.9% and specificity of 97.5%. The use of minimal circuitry
leads to a considerable reduction of power consumption compared to previous

process is highly influenced by genetic factors. Hence, it is important to
identify human aging-related genes. We focus on supervised prediction of such
genes. Gene expression-based methods for this purpose study genes in isolation
from each other. While protein-protein interaction (PPI) network-based methods
for this purpose account for interactions between genes' protein products,
current PPI network data are context-unspecific, spanning different biological
conditions. Instead, here, we focus on an aging-specific subnetwork of the
entire PPI network, obtained by integrating aging-specific gene expression data
and PPI network data. The potential of such data integration has been
recognized but mostly in the context of cancer. So, we are the first to propose
a supervised learning framework for predicting aging-related genes from an
aging-specific PPI subnetwork.
  Results. In a systematic and comprehensive evaluation, we find that in many
of the evaluation tests: (i) using an aging-specific subnetwork indeed yields
more accurate aging-related gene predictions than using the entire network, and
(ii) predictive methods from our framework that have not previously been used
for supervised prediction of aging-related genes outperform existing prominent
methods for the same purpose.
  Conclusion. These results justify the need for our framework.

parameter \emph{J}, which can drive a strong orbital selectivity in the
correlations. The Fe-chalcogens are the most strongly correlated of the
Fe-based superconductors, with $d_{xy}$ the most correlated orbital. Yet little
is understood whether and how such correlations directly affect the
superconducting instability in Hund's systems.
  By applying a recently developed high-fidelity \emph{ab initio} theory, we
show explicitly the connections between correlations in $d_{xy}$ and the
superconducting critical temperature $T_{c}$. Starting from the \emph{ab

to the Fermi energy, and the strength of $J$ emerge as the primary criteria for
incoherent spectral response and enhanced single- and two-particle scattering
that in turn controls $T_{c}$. Using constrained RPA, we show further that FeSe

explain why M-FeSe/STO has a high $T_{c}$, whereas M-FeSe in isolation should
not.

mitigating anthropogenic climate change. To ensure secure storage of this CO2,
it is important to understand the interaction of CO2 injection and migration
with geological layering. For example, seismic monitoring at the Sleipner pilot
project suggests that the injected CO2 is ponding against, and leaking across,
a series of thin, intermediate seals. Here, we develop a gravity-current model
for weakly compressible, two-phase fluid migration in a system of layered
aquifers. Our model includes vertical leakage of both water and gas across
seals, where the latter is subject to a capillary entry threshold. We
demonstrate that the buildup of capillary pressure is very sensitive to the
conductivity and connectivity of water films in the gas region. We identify two
associated limiting cases, where gas obstructs water flow either completely or
not at all. We then explore the parameters that govern gas leakage and the
resulting fluid distributions---demonstrating that this problem involves a
complex interplay between pressure dissipation, capillary pressure buildup, and
fluid migration. We show that decreasing the relative permeability of water in
the gas region can initiate gas leakage or significantly increase the amount of
gas leakage. Finally, we apply our model to rock properties expected for
Sleipner and show that CO2 injection may build up sufficient capillary pressure
to invade the seals---suggesting that, contrary to conventional wisdom, CO2 may
be able to leak across the intermediate seals at Sleipner in the absence of a
focused conduit.

reconnection in magnetically-dominated pair plasmas subject to strong Compton
cooling. Reconnection under such conditions operates in accretion disk coronae
around black holes, which produce hard X-rays through Comptonization. Our
simulations show that most of the plasma in the reconnection layer is kept cold
by Compton losses and locked in magnetically-dominated plasmoids with small
thermal pressure. Compton drag clears cavities inside plasmoids and affects
their bulk motions. These effects, however, weakly change the reconnection rate
and the plasmoid size distribution from those in non-radiative reconnection.
This demonstrates that the reconnection dynamics is governed by similar
magnetic stresses in both cases and weakly affected by thermal pressure. We
examine the energy distribution of particles energized by radiative
reconnection and observe two components. (1) A mildly-relativistic peak, which
results from bulk motions of cooled plasmoids. This component receives most of
the dissipated reconnection power and dominates the output X-ray emission. The
peak has a quasi-Maxwellian shape with an effective temperature of 100 keV.
Thus, it mimics thermal Comptonization used previously to fit hard-state
spectra of accreting black holes. (2) A high-energy tail, which receives 20% of
dissipated reconnection power. It is populated by particles accelerated
impulsively at X-points or ""picked up"" by fast outflows from X-points. The
high-energy particles immediately cool, and their inverse Compton emission
explains the MeV spectral tail detected in the hard state of Cyg X-1. Our
first-principle simulations support reconnection as a mechanism powering hard
X-ray emission from accreting black holes.

tampering is less likely to be noticed, e.g., because the voter uses the audio

historical data do not help much. Hence, there is no way to calibrate a

numerical tool for low-Reynolds number flows since the replacement of a point
force by a smoothed blob overcomes many computational difficulties associated
with flow singularities (Cortez, 2001, \textit{SIAM J. Sci. Comput.}
\textbf{23}, 1204). The physical changes to the flow resulting from this
process are, however, unclear. In this paper, we analyse the flow induced by
general regularised stokeslets. An explicit formula for the flow from any
regularised stokeslet is first derived, which is shown to simplify for
spherically symmetric blobs. Far from the centre of any regularised stokeslet
we show that the flow can be written in terms of an infinite number of
singularity solutions provided the blob decays sufficiently rapidly. This
infinite number of singularities reduces to a point force and source dipole for
spherically symmetric blobs. Slowly-decaying blobs induce additional flow
resulting from the non-zero body forces acting on the fluid. We also show that
near the centre of spherically symmetric regularised stokeslets the flow
becomes isotropic, which contrasts with the flow anisotropy fundamental to
viscous systems. The concepts developed are used to { identify blobs that
reduce regularisation errors. These blobs contain regions of negative force in
order to counter the flows produced in the regularisation process, but still
retain a form convenient for computations.

systems. Understanding their behavior is of broad interest; from the control of
epidemics to understanding brain dynamics. While in some cases there exists a
clear separation of time scales between the propagation of a single spreading
cascade and the initiation of the next -- such that spreading can be modelled
as directed percolation or a branching process -- there are also processes for
which this is not the case, such as zoonotic diseases or spiking cascades in
neural networks. For a large class of relevant network topologies, we show here
that in such a scenario the nature of the overall spreading fundamentally
changes. This change manifests itself in a transition between different
universality classes of critical spreading, which determines the onset and the
properties of an avalanche turning epidemic or neural activity turning
epileptic, for example. We present analytical results in the mean-field limit
giving the critical line along which scale-free spreading behaviour can be
observed. The two limits of this critical line correspond to the universality
classes of directed and undirected percolation, respectively. Outside these two
limits, this duality manifests itself in the appearance of critical exponents
from the universality classes of both directed and undirected percolation. We
find that the transition between these exponents is governed by a competition
between merging and propagation of activity, and identify an appropriate
scaling relationship for the transition point. Finally, we show that commonly
used measures, such as the branching ratio and dynamic susceptibility, fail to
establish criticality in the absence of time-scale separation calling for a
reanalysis of criticality in the brain.

with the prevalence of graph-structured data. Although AL has been widely
studied for alleviating label sparsity issues with the conventional non-related
data, how to make it effective over attributed graphs remains an open research
question. Existing AL algorithms on graphs attempt to reuse the classic AL
query strategies designed for non-related data. However, they suffer from two
major limitations. First, different AL query strategies calculated in distinct
scoring spaces are often naively combined to determine which nodes to be
labelled. Second, the AL query engine and the learning of the classifier are
treated as two separating processes, resulting in unsatisfactory performance.
In this paper, we propose a SEmi-supervised Adversarial active Learning (SEAL)
framework on attributed graphs, which fully leverages the representation power
of deep neural networks and devises a novel AL query strategy in an adversarial
way. Our framework learns two adversarial components: a graph embedding network
that encodes both the unlabelled and labelled nodes into a latent space,
expecting to trick the discriminator to regard all nodes as already labelled,
and a semi-supervised discriminator network that distinguishes the unlabelled
from the existing labelled nodes in the latent space. The divergence score,
generated by the discriminator in a unified latent space, serves as the
informativeness measure to actively select the most informative node to be
labelled by an oracle. The two adversarial components form a closed loop to
mutually and simultaneously reinforce each other towards enhancing the active
learning performance. Extensive experiments on four real-world networks
validate the effectiveness of the SEAL framework with superior performance
improvements to state-of-the-art baselines.

however the corresponding explanation is still in exploration. In this paper,
we examine the influence of surface energy on the hardness of materials under
spherical indentation. To evaluate the ability of materials to resist
indentation, a yield hardness is defined here as the contact pressure at the
inception of material yield. It is found that this defined hardness is an
intrinsic material property depending only on the yield strength and Poisson
ratio in conventional continuum mechanics. Then, the impact of surface energy
on the yield hardness is analyzed through finite element simulations. By using
the dimensional analysis, the dependences of the yield hardness and critical
indent depth at yield initiation on surface energy have been achieved. When the
yield strength is comparable to the ratio of surface energy density to indenter
radius, surface energy will alter the yield hardness and the critical indent
depth. As the size of indenter decreases to nanoscale, both the yield hardness
and the indent depth will increase significantly. This study provides a
possible clarification to the size dependence of hardness and a potential
approach to measure the yield strength and surface energy of solids through
nanosized indentations.

consumption. To improve its energy performance, it is important to fairly
benchmark its energy performance and provide the evaluation feedback to users.
However, this task has not been well tackled in the residential sector. In this
paper, we propose a data-driven approach to fairly benchmark the AC energy
performance of residential rooms. First, regression model is built for each
benchmarked room so that its power consumption can be predicted given different
weather conditions and AC settings. Then, all the rooms are clustered based on
their areas and usual AC temperature set points. Lastly, within each cluster,
rooms are benchmarked based on their predicted power consumption under uniform
weather conditions and AC settings. A real-world case study was conducted with
data collected from 44 residential rooms. Results show that the constructed
regression models have an average prediction accuracy of 85.1% in
cross-validation tests, and support vector regression with Gaussian kernel is
the overall most suitable model structure for building the regression model. In
the clustering step, 44 rooms are successfully clustered into seven clusters.
By comparing the benchmarking scores generated by the proposed approach with
two sets of scores computed from historical power consumption data, we
demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to eliminate the influences of
room areas, weather conditions, and AC settings on the benchmarking results.
Therefore, the proposed benchmarking approach is valid and fair. As a
by-product, the approach is also shown to be useful to investigate how room
areas, weather conditions, and AC settings affect the AC power consumption of
rooms in real life.

Single-shot imaging with SVE enables us not only to produce images without
color saturation regions from a single-shot image, but also to avoid ghost
artifacts in the producing ones. However, the number of exposures is generally
limited to two, and moreover it is difficult to decide the optimum exposure
values before the photographing. In the proposed scheme, a scene segmentation
method is applied to input multi-exposure images, and then the luminance of the
input images is adjusted according to both of the number of scenes and the
relationship between exposure values and pixel values. The proposed method with
the luminance adjustment allows us to improve the above two issues. In this
paper, we focus on dual-ISO imaging as one of single-shot imaging. In an
experiment, the proposed scheme is demonstrated to be effective for single-shot
high dynamic range imaging with SVE, compared with conventional MEF schemes
with exposure compensation.

portfolio of contributing activities. They do not only commit source code but
also spend a significant amount of effort on other communicative,
organizational, and supportive activities. However, almost all prior research
focuses on a limited number of specific activities and fails to analyze elite
developers' activities in a comprehensive way. To bridge this gap, we conduct
an empirical study with fine-grained event data from 20 large open-source
projects hosted on GitHub. Thus, we investigate elite developers' contributing
activities and their impacts on project outcomes. Our analyses reveal three key
findings: (1) they participate in a variety of activities while technical
contributions (e.g., coding) accounting for a small proportion only; (2) they
tend to put more effort into supportive and communicative activities and less
effort into coding as the project grows; (3) their participation in
non-technical activities is negatively associated with the project's outcomes
in term of productivity and software quality. These results provide a panoramic
view of elite developers' activities and can inform an individual's decision
making about effort allocation, thus leading to finer project outcomes. The
results also provide implications for supporting these elite developers.

match the anatomy of the hand, permitting data capture during natural

in the inertia-less limit using the standard technique of superposition of
vector harmonics and the solutions obtained are reported in terms of steady

we calculate the extra force required to stabilize the concentric configuration
of a translating compound particle. A comprehensive comparison of drop

findings, we propose pulsatile flow as a reliable method to transport compound

ingroup favoritism arises due to perceptual biases like outgroup homogeneity,
the tendency for humans to have greater difficulty distinguishing outgroup

boards. Solder paste printer (SPP), package mounter, and solder reflow oven are

monitored by solder paste inspector (SPI). If SPP malfunctions due to the
printer defects, the SPP produces defective products, and then abnormal
patterns are detected by SPI. In this paper, we propose a convolutional
recurrent reconstructive network (CRRN), which decomposes the anomaly patterns
generated by the printer defects, from SPI data. CRRN learns only normal data
and detects anomaly pattern through reconstruction error. CRRN consists of a
spatial encoder (S-Encoder), a spatiotemporal encoder and decoder
(ST-Encoder-Decoder), and a spatial decoder (S-Decoder). The ST-Encoder-Decoder
consists of multiple convolutional spatiotemporal memories (CSTMs) with
ST-Attention mechanism. CSTM is developed to extract spatiotemporal patterns
efficiently. Additionally, a spatiotemporal attention (ST-Attention) mechanism
is designed to facilitate transmitting information from the ST-Encoder to the

the proposed CRRN outperforms the other conventional models in anomaly

numerous real-world applications. Most existing methods require laborious
frame-level supervision to train action localization models. In this work, we
propose a framework, called 3C-Net, which only requires video-level supervision

count. We introduce a novel formulation to learn discriminative action features
with enhanced localization capabilities. Our joint formulation has three terms:
a classification term to ensure the separability of learned action features, an
adapted multi-label center loss term to enhance the action feature
discriminability and a counting loss term to delineate adjacent action
sequences, leading to improved localization. Comprehensive experiments are
performed on two challenging benchmarks: THUMOS14 and ActivityNet 1.2. Our
approach sets a new state-of-the-art for weakly-supervised temporal action
localization on both datasets. On the THUMOS14 dataset, the proposed method
achieves an absolute gain of 4.6% in terms of mean average precision (mAP),

Imager onboard the Japanese Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki from June to October
2017, revealing a dramatic evolution of planetary-scale waves and corresponding
changes in planetary-scale UV features. We identified a prominent 5-day
periodicity in both the winds and brightness variations, whose phase velocities
were slower than the dayside mean zonal winds (or the super-rotation) by >35 m
s$^{-1}$. The reconstructed planetary-scale vortices were nearly equatorially
symmetric and centered at ~35{\deg} latitude in both hemispheres, which
indicated that they were part of a Rossby wave. The amplitude of winds
variation associated with the observed Rossby wave packet were amplified
gradually over ~20 days and attenuated over ~50 days. Following the formation
of the Rossby wave vortices, brightness variation emerges to form rippling
white cloud belts in the 45{\deg}-60{\deg} latitudes of both hemispheres.
~3.8-day periodic signals were observed in the zonal wind and brightness
variations in the equatorial region before the Rossby wave amplification.
Although the amplitude and significance of the 3.8-day mode were relatively low
in the observation season, this feature is consistent with a Kelvin wave, which
may be the cause of the dark clusters in the equatorial region.

require us to perform feature engineering that is known and agreed to be the
key to success in applied machine learning. Research efforts dedicated to
representation learning, especially representation learning using deep
learning, has shown us ways to automatically learn relevant features from vast
amounts of potentially noisy, raw data. However, most of the methods are not
adequate to handle heterogeneous information networks which pretty much
represents most real-world data today. The methods cannot preserve the
structure and semantic of multiple types of nodes and links well enough,
capture higher-order heterogeneous connectivity patterns, and ensure coverage

heterogeneous networks. Specifically, we leverage higher-order, recurring, and
statistically significant network connectivity patterns in the form of motifs
to transform the original graph to motif graph(s), conduct biased random walk
to efficiently explore higher order neighborhoods, and then employ
heterogeneous skip-gram model to generate the embeddings. Unlike previous
efforts that uses different graph meta-structures to guide the random walk, we
use graph motifs to transform the original network and preserve the

services in smart cities. ITSs produce better-informed decisions using

Network (VANET) is a communication infrastructure responsible for exchanging
data between vehicles and Traffic Management Centers (TMC). VANET performance
(packet delay and drop rate) can affect the performance of ITS applications.
Furthermore, the distribution of communicating vehicles affects the VANET
performance. So, capturing this mutual impact between communication and
transportation is crucial to understanding the behavior of ITS applications.
Thus, this paper focuses on studying the mutual impact of VANET communication
and mobility in city-level ITSs. We first introduce a new scalable and
computationally fast framework for modeling large-scale ITSs including
communication and mobility. In the proposed framework, we develop and validate
a new mathematical model for the IEEE 802.11p MAC protocol which can capture
the behavior of medium access and queuing process. This MAC model is then
integrated within a microscopic traffic simulator to accurately simulate
vehicle mobility. This integrated framework can accurately capture the
mobility, communication, and the spatiotemporal impacts in large-scale ITSs.
Secondly, the proposed framework is used to study the impact of communication
on eco-routing navigation performance in a real large-scale network with real
calibrated vehicular traffic. The paper demonstrates that communication
performance can significantly degrade the performance of the dynamic
eco-routing navigation when the traffic density is high. It also shows that the
fuel consumption can be increased due to lack of communication reliability.

eigenvector and the corresponding ""tropical"" matrix, arising out of the $max$

more general class of matrices, and explore the extent to which we can
generalize the results using tropical techniques. We find that while the
original results do not easily generalize, we can still make some useful
statements about the asymptotic behavior in the general case, and can give a

order of ~10^-3 - 10^-2 cm^2/(Vs) at room temperature. In this study, we
present the Hall effect characterization of a-Ge prepared by self-ion
implantation of Ge ions. The a-Ge prepared by this method is highly homogenous
and has a mass density within 98.5% of the crystalline Ge. The material
exhibits an exceptionally high electrical conductivity and carrier mobility
(~100 cm^2/(Vs)) for an amorphous semiconductor. The temperature-dependent
resistivity of the material is very-well defined with two distinctive regions,
extrinsic and intrinsic conductivity, as in crystalline Ge. These results are
direct evidence for a largely-preserved band structure and non-localized states

carbon nanotube that achieves these requirements. In contrast to the prevailing
semiconducting qubits that use electronic states in double quantum dots, our
qubit utilizes the natural electronic wavefunctions in a single quantum dot.
Using an ultraclean nanotube we construct a qubit from two wavefunctions with
significantly different magnetic moments and spatial charge distributions,
making it sensitive to both magnetic and electric fields. We use an array of
gates to directly image these wavefunctions and demonstrate their localized
moments. Owing to their different spatial structure, these wavefunctions also
show radically different transport properties, giving us a simple
transport-based qubit readout mechanism. Due to its narrow coherence-limited
transition, the qubit demonstrates significantly better electric field
detection sensitivity than a single electron transistor. Moreover, with the

introduced a universal version of the deformation theory for the Schouten
algebra of polyvector fields on affine manifolds. This universal deformation
complex takes the form of a differential graded Lie algebra of graphs, denoted
$\mathsf{fGC}_2$, together with an injective morphism towards the
Chevalley-Eilenberg complex associated with the Schouten algebra. The latter
morphism is given by explicit local formulas making implicit use of the
supergeometric interpretation of the Schouten algebra as the algebra of
functions on a graded symplectic manifold of degree $1$. The ambition of the
present work is to generalise Kontsevich's construction to graded symplectic
manifolds of arbitrary degree $n\geq1$. The corresponding graph model is given
by the full Kontsevich graph complex $\mathsf{fGC}_d$ where $d=n+1$ stands for
the dimension of the associated AKSZ type $\sigma$-model. This generalisation
is instrumental to classify universal structures on graded symplectic
manifolds. In particular, the zeroth cohomology of the full graph complex
$\mathsf{fGC}_{d}$ is shown to act via $\mathsf{Lie}_\infty$-automorphisms on
the algebra of functions on graded symplectic manifolds of degree $n$. This
generalises the known action of the Grothendieck-Teichm\""{u}ller algebra
$\mathfrak{grt}_1\simeq H^0(\mathsf{fGC}_2)$ on the space of polyvector fields.
This extended action can in turn be used to generate new universal deformations
of Hamiltonian functions, generalising Kontsevich flows on the space of Poisson
manifolds to differential graded manifolds of higher degrees. As an application
of the general formalism, universal deformations of Courant algebroids via

(DCE-MRI) is a challenging task, due to changes in image appearance. In this
study a groupwise registration, using a principle component analysis (PCA)
based metric,1 is evaluated for clinical DCE MRI of the liver. The groupwise
registration transforms the images to a common space, rather than to a
reference volume as conventional pairwise methods do, and computes the
similarity metric on all volumes simultaneously. This groupwise registration
method is compared to a pairwise approach using a mutual information metric.
Clinical DCE MRI of the abdomen of eight patients were included. Per patient
one lesion in the liver was manually segmented in all temporal images (N=16).
The registered images were compared for accuracy, spatial and temporal
smoothness after transformation, and lesion volume change. Compared to a
pairwise method or no registration, groupwise registration provided better
alignment. In our recently started clinical study groupwise registered clinical
DCE MRI of the abdomen of nine patients were scored by three radiologists.
Groupwise registration increased the assessed quality of alignment. The gain in
reading time for the radiologist was estimated to vary from no difference to
almost a minute. A slight increase in reader confidence was also observed.
Registration had no added value for images with little motion. In conclusion,
the groupwise registration of DCE MR images results in better alignment than
achieved by pairwise registration, which is beneficial for clinical assessment.

fronts near the homoclinic snaking region, involving a spatial stripe cellular
pattern embedded in a quiescent state, in the two-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg
equation with either a quadratic-cubic or cubic-quintic nonlinearity. We focus
on depinning fronts involving stripes that are orientated either parallel,
oblique and perpendicular to the front interface, and almost planar depinning
fronts. We show that invading parallel depinning fronts select both a far-field
wavenumber and a propagation wavespeed whereas retreating parallel depinning
fronts come in families where the wavespeed is a function of the far-field
wavenumber. Employing a far-field core decomposition, we propose a boundary
value problem for the invading depinning fronts which we numerically solve and
use path-following routines to trace out bifurcation diagrams. We then carry
out a thorough numerical investigation of the parallel, oblique, perpendicular
stripe, and almost planar invasion fronts. We find that almost planar invasion
fronts in the cubic-quintic Swift-Hohenberg equation bifurcate off parallel
invasion fronts and co-exist close to the homoclinic snaking region.
Sufficiently far from the 1D homoclinic snaking region, no almost planar
invasion fronts exist and we find that parallel invasion stripe fronts may
regain transverse stability if they propagate above a critical speed. Finally,
we show that depinning fronts shed light on the time simulations of fully
localised patches of stripes on the plane. The numerical algorithms detailed

confined only along one dimension, present fundamentally different excitonic
properties than quantum dots, which support strong confinement in all three
dimensions. In particular, multiple excitons strongly confined in just one
dimension are free to re-arrange in the lateral plane, reducing the probability
for multi-body collisions. Thus, while simultaneous multiple photon emission is
typically quenched in quantum dots, in nanoplatelets its probability can be
tuned according to size and shape. Here, we focus on analyzing multi-exciton
dynamics in individual CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets of various sizes through the
measurement of second-, third-, and fourth-order photon correlations. Thus, for
the first time, we can directly probe the dynamics of the two, three and four
exciton states in the single nanocrystal level. Remarkably, although higher
orders of correlation vary substantially among the synthesis products, they
strongly correlate with the value of second order antibunching. The scaling of
the higher order moments with the degree of antibunching presents a small yet
clear deviation from the accepted model of Auger recombination through binary
collisions. Such a deviation suggests that many-body contributions are present
already at the level of triexcitons. These findings highlight the benefit of
high-order photon correlation spectroscopy as a technique to study
multi-exciton dynamics in colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals.

keV emission line is the Micro-X sounding rocket telescope. According to the
estimate made in 2015, Micro-X will be able to detect on average about 18.2
photons from the 3.5 keV line during its 300-second-long planned observation.
However, this estimate is based on the extrapolation of the 3.5 keV line signal
from the innermost Galactic Centre (GC) region available in 2015. With newly
available reports on the 3.5 keV line emission in five off-centre regions, we
found that similar Micro-X payload will result in 3.4-4.3 counts on average,
depending on the dark matter distribution. Therefore, we show that the 3.5 keV
line is unlikely to be detected with a single Micro-X launch using an original
Micro-X payload. Increasing its field-of-view from 20$^\circ$ to 33$^\circ$ and
its repointing out of GC (to avoid the brightest X-ray point source on the sky,
Sco X-1) will increase the expected number of counts from 3.5 keV line to
7.5-7.9, which corresponds to its expected marginal ($\sim 2\sigma$) detection
within a single Micro-X observation.

either based on Recurrent or Convolutional Neural Networks (RNNs or CNNs).
However, RNN-based frameworks can only tackle sequences with limited frames
because sequential models are sensitive to bad frames and tend to drift over
long sequences. Although existing CNN-based temporal frameworks attempt to
address the sensitivity and drift problems by concurrently processing all input
frames in the sequence, the existing state-of-the-art CNN-based framework is
limited to 3d pose estimation of a single frame from a sequential input. In
this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework that utilizes matrix
factorization for sequential 3d human poses estimation. Our approach processes
all input frames concurrently to avoid the sensitivity and drift problems, and
yet outputs the 3d pose estimates for every frame in the input sequence. More
specifically, the 3d poses in all frames are represented as a motion matrix
factorized into a trajectory bases matrix and a trajectory coefficient matrix.
The trajectory bases matrix is precomputed from matrix factorization approaches
such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT),
and the problem of sequential 3d pose estimation is reduced to training a deep
network to regress the trajectory coefficient matrix. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on long sequences by achieving state-of-the-art

strong indicator of a massive outflow. Our finding supports the connection
between two independent observational signatures of the wind in super-Eddington
sources: a lower temperature of the Comptonized component, and the presence of
emission lines in the soft X-ray band. We speculate that the donor star is
oxygen-rich: a CO or O-Ne-Mg white dwarf in an ultracompact binary. If that is

salient object detection task. However, most existing FCNs-based methods still
suffer from coarse object boundaries. In this paper, to solve this problem, we
focus on the complementarity between salient edge information and salient
object information. Accordingly, we present an edge guidance network (EGNet)
for salient object detection with three steps to simultaneously model these two
kinds of complementary information in a single network. In the first step, we
extract the salient object features by a progressive fusion way. In the second
step, we integrate the local edge information and global location information
to obtain the salient edge features. Finally, to sufficiently leverage these
complementary features, we couple the same salient edge features with salient
object features at various resolutions. Benefiting from the rich edge
information and location information in salient edge features, the fused
features can help locate salient objects, especially their boundaries more
accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs
favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on six widely used datasets

flares convert magnetic energy into thermal energy of plasma and kinetic energy

reconnection, protons are injected downwards from the coronal acceleration
region and can interact with dense plasma in the lower solar atmosphere,
producing mesons that will subsequently decay into gamma rays and neutrinos at

blockchains have become a disruptive technology that has shaken the world.
However, the rising popularity of the paradigm has led to a flurry of proposals
addressing variations and/or trying to solve problems stemming from the initial
specification. This added considerable complexity to the current blockchain
ecosystems, amplified by the absence of detail in many accompanying blockchain
whitepapers.
  Through this paper, we set out to explain blockchains in a simple way, taming
that complexity through the deconstruction of the blockchain into three simple,
critical components common to all known systems: membership selection,
consensus mechanism and structure. We propose an evaluation framework with
insight into system models, desired properties and analysis criteria, using the
decoupled components as criteria. We use this framework to provide clear and
intuitive overviews of the design principles behind the analyzed systems and
the properties achieved. We hope our effort will help clarifying the current
state of blockchain proposals and provide directions to the analysis of future
proposals.

conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models are widely applied statistical
tools for modelling volatility clusters (i.e., periods of increased or

derived based on nonlinear least squares and on the maximum-likelihood

their beliefs regarding the service time distribution. The inconsistent beliefs
may arise from randomness in the server state along with noisy signals that

differing beliefs. We characterize the Nash equilibrium dynamics for
exponentially distributed service times and show how they substantially differ
from the model with homogeneous customers. We further provide an explicit

small convolutional kernels, which is not possible with a simple feed-forward
network. Some methods solve this problem by using segmentation into superpixels
while others downscale the image through the network and rescale it back to its
original size. The objective of this paper is to show that saliency
convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be improved by using a Green's function
convolution (GFC) to extrapolate edges features into salient regions. The GFC
acts as a gradient integrator, allowing to produce saliency features by filling
thin edges directly inside the CNN. Hence, we propose the gradient integration
and sum (GIS) layer that combines the edges features with the saliency
features. Using the HED and DSS architecture, we demonstrated that adding a GIS
layer near the network's output allows to reduce the sensitivity to the
parameter initialization, to reduce the overfitting and to improve the
repeatability of the training. By simply adding a GIS layer to the
state-of-the-art DSS model, there is an absolute increase of 1.6% for the
F-measure on the DUT-OMRON dataset, with only 10ms of additional computation
time. The GIS layer further allows the network to perform significantly better
in the case of highly noisy images or low-brightness images. In fact, we
observed an F-measure improvement of 5.2% when noise was added to the dataset
and 2.8% when the brightness was reduced. Since the GIS layer is model
agnostic, it can be implemented into different fully convolutional networks. A
major contribution of the current work is the first implementation of Green's
function convolution inside a neural network, which allows the network to
operate in the feature domain and in the gradient domain at the same time, thus
improving the regional representation via edge filling.

carrier densities is systematically studied using depth-resolved
cathodoluminescence (CL) and photoluminescence (PL) as well as valence band
X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (VB-XPS). AN up to 17-fold enhanced PL UV
emission for Al-coated ZnO with the highest carrier density (2 x 10^17 cm^-3)
was measured, which falls to a 12-fold increase for the lowest carrier density
(3 x 10^13 cm^-3). Depth-resolved CL measurements confirm that the enhancement
is strongest near the metal coating-ZnO interface consistent with an increased
UV emission due to an exciton-localized surface plasmon coupling mechanism.
Correlative CL, PL and VB-XPS studies reveal that a number of additional
effects to the presence of the Al surface coating also contribute to the UV
enhancement factor. These include increased UV enhancement due to the formation
of a surface depletion layer induced by the metal surface coating, which also
passivates competitive non-radiative surface recombination channels found in
uncoated ZnO. Significantly, it was established that the magnitude of the
emission enhancement factor can be raised in a controlled way by reducing the
thickness of the depletion layer by increasing the carrier density. The
contribution of these effects collectively provides an explanation for the
large span of enhancement factors reported in the literature.

Hebbian-based and the population-based learning methods, have been developed
for modeling and simulating dynamic systems. However, these methods are faced
with several obvious limitations. Most of these models are extremely time
consuming when learning the large-scale FCMs with hundreds of nodes.
Furthermore, the FCMs learned by those algorithms lack robustness when the
experimental data contain noise. In addition, reasonable distribution of the
weights is rarely considered in these algorithms, which could result in the
reduction of the performance of the resulting FCM. In this article, a
straightforward, rapid, and robust learning method is proposed to learn FCMs
from noisy data, especially, to learn large-scale FCMs. The crux of the
proposed algorithm is to equivalently transform the learning problem of FCMs to
a classic-constrained convex optimization problem in which the least-squares
term ensures the robustness of the well-learned FCM and the maximum entropy
term regularizes the distribution of the weights of the well-learned FCM. A
series of experiments covering two frequently used activation functions (the
sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions) are performed on both synthetic
datasets with noise and real-world datasets. The experimental results show that
the proposed method is rapid and robust against data containing noise and that
the well-learned weights have better distribution. In addition, the FCMs
learned by the proposed method also exhibit superior performance in comparison
with the existing methods. Index Terms-Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), maximum

lower-dimension space in each client, which significantly mitigates the
pressure of data communication in federated learning. The encoded gradient
updates are directly recovered as a whole, i.e. the aggregated gradient updates

this way, gradient updates encrypted in each client are not only prevented from
interception during communication, but also unknown to the server. Based on the

analysis of imbalanced datasets. It is known that SMOTE frequently
over-generalizes the minority class, leading to misclassifications for the
majority class, and effecting the overall balance of the model.
  In this article, we present an approach that overcomes this limitation of
SMOTE, employing Localized Random Affine Shadowsampling (LoRAS) to oversample
from an approximated data manifold of the minority class.
  We benchmarked our algorithm with 14 publicly available imbalanced datasets
using three different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and compared the
performance of LoRAS, SMOTE and several SMOTE extensions that share the concept
of using convex combinations of minority class data points for oversampling
with LoRAS. We observed that LoRAS, on average generates better ML models in
terms of F1-Score and Balanced accuracy. Another key observation is that while
most of the extensions of SMOTE we have tested, improve the F1-Score with
respect to SMOTE on an average, they compromise on the Balanced accuracy of a
classification model. LoRAS on the contrary, improves both F1 Score and the
Balanced accuracy thus produces better classification models.
  Moreover, to explain the success of the algorithm, we have constructed a
mathematical framework to prove that LoRAS oversampling technique provides a
better estimate for the mean of the underlying local data distribution of the
minority class data space.

the successful neural models of language. We collect different interpretations

media, and is often used to map properties in the subsurface of the Earth. In
order to better interpret the resulting images it is important to assess
imaging uncertainties. Since tomography is significantly nonlinear, Monte Carlo
sampling methods are often used for this purpose, but they are generally
computationally intractable for large datasets and high-dimensional parameter
spaces. To extend uncertainty analysis to larger systems we use variational
inference methods to conduct seismic tomography. In contrast to Monte Carlo
sampling, variational methods solve the Bayesian inference problem as an
optimization problem, yet still provide probabilistic results. In this study,
we applied two variational methods, automatic differential variational
inference (ADVI) and Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), to 2D seismic
tomography problems using both synthetic and real data and we compare the
results to those from two different Monte Carlo sampling methods. The results
show that variational inference methods can produce accurate approximations to
the results of Monte Carlo sampling methods at significantly lower
computational cost, provided that gradients of parameters with respect to data
can be calculated efficiently. We expect that the methods can be applied
fruitfully to many other types of geophysical inverse problems.

  Markov Processes",,,,,"math.OC math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of coordinate processes for the modelling of impulse control for {\em
general}\/ Markov processes typically involves the construction of a
probability measure on a countable product of copies of the path space. In
addition, admissibility of an impulse control policy requires that the random
times of the interventions be stopping times with respect to different
filtrations arising from the different component coordinate processes. When the
underlying Markov process has {\em continuous}\/ paths, however, a simpler
model can be developed which takes the single path space as its probability
space and uses the natural filtration with respect to which the intervention
times must be stopping times. Moreover, this model construction allows for
impulse control with random effects whereby the decision maker selects a
distribution of the new state. This paper gives the construction of the
probability measure on the path space for an admissible intervention policy
subject to a randomized impulse mechanism. It also identifies a class of
impulse policies under which the resulting controlled process is Markov and a
further subclass which results in a Markov family. In addition, a class of
polices is defined for which the paths between interventions are independent
and again a further subclass for which the cycles following the initial cycle
are identically distributed. A benefit of this smaller subclass of policies is
that one is allowed to use classical renewal arguments to analyze long-term
average control problems. The decision to use an $(s,S)$ ordering policy in
inventory management provides an example of an impulse policy for which the
process is Markov and has i.i.d.~cycles.

an attempt to make an assessment and characterise the coming years in terms of
solar activity and space radiation environment especially due to the abundance
of highly energetic heavy ions (known as HZE charged particles). These HZE
particle fluxes constitute a major hazard to the astronauts and also to the
critical electronic components of the spacecraft. Recent data on the HZE
species (from B to Ni) obtained from ACE spacecraft shows a clear enhancement
of the particle fluxes between the solar cycle 23 and solar cycle 24 (between
SSN peaks 2002 and 2014) due to the persisting low sunspot numbers of the
latter cycle. The peak values of these cosmic ray fluxes occur with a time lag
of about a year of the corresponding minimum value of the sunspots of a
particular 11-year cycle which is pseudo-periodic in nature. This is
demonstrated by the Fourier and Wavelet transform analyses of the long duration
(1700-2018) yearly mean sunspot number data. The same time series data is also
used to train a Hybrid Regression Neural Network (HRNN) model to generate the
predicted yearly mean sunspot numbers for the solar cycle 25 (2019-2031). The
wavelet analysis of this new series of annual sunspot numbers including the
predictions up to the end of 2031 shows a clear trend of continuation of the

$\alpha_s^3 \ln^2 \alpha_s$. At the same time one also observes that the RGOPT
predictions are less sensitive to variations of the arbitrary $\bar{\rm MS}$

that the RGOPT provides an efficient resummation scheme which may be considered
as an alternative to lattice simulations at high baryonic densities.

key example is bacterial degradation of marine snow responsible for carbon
export from the upper ocean in the biological pump. The ecological interaction
between bacteria and sinking particles is regulated by their encounter rate,
which is therefore important to predict accurately in models of
bacteria-particle interactions. Models available to date cover the diffusive
encounter regime, valid for sinking particles larger than the typical run
length of a bacterium. The majority of sinking particles, however, are small,
and the encounter process is then ballistic rather than diffusive. In the
ballistic regime, the shear generated by the particle's motion can be important
in reorienting bacteria and thus determining the encounter rate, yet the effect
of shear is not captured in current encounter rate models. Here, we combine
analytical and numerical calculations to quantify the encounter rate between
sinking particles and non-motile or motile microorganisms in the ballistic
regime, explicitly accounting for the hydrodynamic shear created by the
particle and its coupling with microorganism shape. We complement results with
selected experiments on non-motile diatoms. We find that the shape-shear
coupling has a considerable effect on the encounter rate and encounter location
through the mechanisms of hydrodynamic focusing and screening, whereby
elongated microorganisms preferentially orient normally to the particle surface
downstream of the particle (focusing) and tangentially to the particle surface
upstream of the particle (screening). We study these mechanisms as a function
of the key dimensionless parameters: the ratio of particle sinking speed to
microorganism swimming speed, the ratio of particle radius to microorganism
length, and the microorganism's aspect ratio.

of 34,276 stars observed from 2009-2013 by both the GALEX (NUV) and Kepler
(optical) space missions with the eventual goal of investigating
multi-wavelength flares. From the GALEX data we constructed light curves with a
10 second cadence, and ultimately detected 1,904 short duration flares on 1,021
stars. The vast majority (94.5\%) of these flares have durations less than five
minutes, with flare flux enhancements above the quiescent flux level ranging
from 1.5 to 1700. The flaring stars are primarily solar-like, with T$_{\rm
eff}$ ranging from 3,000-11,000 K and radii between 0.5-15 R$_{\odot}$. This
set of flaring stars is almost entirely distinct from that of previous flare
surveys of Kepler data and indicates a previously undetected collection of
small flares contained within the Kepler sample. The range in flare energies
spans 1.8$\times$10$^{32}$-8.9$\times$10$^{37}$ erg, with associated relative
errors spanning 2-87\%. The flare frequency distribution by energy follows a
power-law with index $\alpha=1.72\pm0.05$, consistent with results of other
solar and stellar flare studies at a range of wavelengths. This supports the
idea that the NUV flares we observe are governed by the same physical processes
present in solar and optical flares. The relationship between flare duration
and associated flare energy extends results found for solar and stellar
white-light flares, and suggests that these flares originate in regions with
magnetic field strengths of several hundred Gauss, and length scales of order
10$^{10}$ cm.

dilute and semidilute conditions. The analysis is performed for different
capillary numbers, volume fraction and viscosity ratio under the assumption of
negligible inertia and zero buoyancy force. The effective viscosity of the
system increases for low values of the volume fraction and decreases for higher
values, with a maximum for about 20 % concentration of the disperse phase. When
the dispersed fluid has lower viscosity, the normalised effective viscosity
becomes smaller than 1 for high enough volume fractions. To single out the
effect of droplet coalescence on the rheology of the emulsion we introduce an
Eulerian force which prevents merging, effectively modelling the presence of
surfactants in the system. When the coalescence is inhibited the effective
viscosity is always greater than 1 and the curvature of the function
representing the emulsion effective viscosity vs. the volume fraction becomes
positive, resembling the behaviour of suspensions of deformable particles. The
reduction of the effective viscosity in the presence of coalescence is
associated to the reduction of the total surface of the disperse phase when the
droplets merge, which leads to a reduction of the interface tension
contribution to the total shear stress. The probability density function of the
flow topology parameter shows that the flow is mostly a shear flow in the
matrix phase, with regions of extensional flow when the coalescence is
prohibited. The flow in the disperse phase, instead, always shows rotational
components. The first normal stress difference is positive whereas the second
normal difference is negative, with their ratio being constant with the volume
fraction. Our results clearly show that the coalescence efficiency strongly
affects the system rheology and neglecting droplet merging can lead to
erroneous predictions.

closest vector problem for certain norms. The currently fastest algorithm
(Dadush and Kun 2016) for general norms has running time of $2^{O(n)}
(1/\epsilon)^n$. We improve this substantially in the following two cases. For
$\ell_p$-norms with $p>2$ (resp. $p \in [1,2]$) fixed, we present an algorithm
with a running time of $2^{O(n)} (1/\epsilon)^{n/2}$ (resp. $2^{O(n)}
(1/\epsilon)^{n/p}$). This result is based on a geometric covering problem,
that was introduced in the context of CVP by Eisenbrand et al.: How many convex
bodies are needed to cover the ball of the norm such that, if scaled by two
around their centroids, each one is contained in the $(1+\epsilon)$-scaled
homothet of the norm ball? We provide upper bounds for this problem by
exploiting the \emph{modulus of smoothness} of the $\ell_p$-balls. Applying a
covering scheme, we can boost any constant approximation algorithm for CVP to a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with the improved run time, either using
a straightforward sampling routine or using the deterministic algorithm of
Dadush for the construction of an epsilon net. The space requirement only
depends on the constant approximation CVP solver used. Furthermore, we
generalise the result of Eisenbrand et al. for the $\ell_\infty$-norm. For
centrally symmetric polytopes (resp. zonotopes) with $O(n)$ facets (resp.
generated by $O(n)$ line segments), we provide a deterministic
$O(\log_2(1/\epsilon))^{O(n)}$ time algorithm. Finally, we establish a
connection between the \emph{modulus of smoothness} and \emph{lattice
sparsification}. Using the enumeration and sparsification tools developped by
Dadush, Kun, Peikert and Vempala, this leads to a simple alternative to the
boosting procedure for CVP under $\ell_p$-norms. This connection might be of

of 6 subjects performing 9 tasks with 10 repetitions each, which leads to 540

the inflow occurs through a highly advective, turbulent, optically thick,

thickness comparable to the radius, $H \sim r$. The accreting fluid is
supported above the midplane in large part by the magnetic field, with the gas

thermally stable, even though the radiation pressure strongly dominates over
gas pressure. A significant part of the radiation emerging from the disk is
captured by the black hole, so the disk is less luminous than a thin disk would

  Argument Acceptability: Technical Report",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In abstract argumentation theory, many argumentation semantics have been
proposed for evaluating argumentation frameworks. This paper is based on the
following research question: Which semantics corresponds well to what humans
consider a rational judgment on the acceptability of arguments? There are two
systematic ways to approach this research question: A normative perspective is
provided by the principle-based approach, in which semantics are evaluated
based on their satisfaction of various normatively desirable principles. A
descriptive perspective is provided by the empirical approach, in which
cognitive studies are conducted to determine which semantics best predicts
human judgments about arguments. In this paper, we combine both approaches to
motivate a new argumentation semantics called SCF2. For this purpose, we
introduce and motivate two new principles and show that no semantics from the
literature satisfies both of them. We define SCF2 and prove that it satisfies
both new principles. Furthermore, we discuss findings of a recent empirical
cognitive study that provide additional support to SCF2.

efficient if the distances between the data points satisfy a metric. These
algorithms include metric learning, clustering, and dimension reduction. As
real data sets are noisy, distances often fail to satisfy a metric. For this
reason, Gilbert and Jain and Fan et al. introduced the closely related sparse
metric repair and metric violation distance problems. The goal of these
problems is to repair as few distances as possible to ensure they satisfy a
metric. Three variants were considered, one admitting a polynomial time
algorithm. The other variants were shown to be APX-hard, and an
$O(OPT^{1/3})$-approximation was given, where $OPT$ is the optimal solution
size.
  In this paper, we generalize these problems to no longer consider all
distances between the data points. That is, we consider a weighted graph $G$
with corrupted weights $w$, and our goal is to find the smallest number of
weight modifications so that the resulting weighted graph distances satisfy a
metric. This is a natural generalization and is more flexible as it takes into
account different relationships among the data points. As in previous work, we
distinguish among the types of repairs permitted and focus on the increase only
and general versions. We demonstrate the inherent combinatorial structure of
the problem, and give an approximation-preserving reduction from MULTICUT.
Conversely, we show that for any fixed constant $\varsigma$, for the large
class of $\varsigma$-chordal graphs, the problems are fixed parameter
tractable. Call a cycle broken if it contains an edge whose weight is larger
than the sum of all its other edges, and call the amount of this difference its
deficit. We present approximation algorithms, one which depends on the maximum
number of edges in a broken cycle, and one which depends on the number of
distinct deficit values.

confirm the magnetic nature of a fourth star (WD 2138-332) in which we had
previously detected a field at a 3 sigma level. The spectra of all these white
dwarfs are characterised by the presence of metal lines and lack of H and He
lines, that is, they belong to the spectral class DZ. The polarisation signal
of the Ca II H+K lines of WD 1009-184 is particularly spectacular, with an
amplitude of 20% that is due to the presence of a magnetic field with an
average line-of-sight component of 40kG. We have thus established that at least
40% of the known DZ white dwarfs with an He-rich atmosphere contained in the
20pc volume have a magnetic field, while further observations are needed to
establish whether the remaining DZ white dwarfs in the same volume are magnetic
or not. Metal lines in the spectra of DZ white dwarfs are thought to have
originated by accretion from rocky debris, and it might be argued that a link
exists between metal accretion and higher occurrence of magnetism. However, we
are not able to distinguish whether the magnetic field and the presence of a
polluted atmosphere have a common origin, or if it is the presence of metal
lines that allows us to detect a higher frequency of magnetic fields in cool
white dwarfs, which would otherwise have featureless spectra. We argue that the
new highly sensitive longitudinal field measurements that we have made in
recent years are consistent with the idea that the magnetic field appears more
frequently in older than in younger white dwarfs.

Meanwhile, to minimize the computational cost of learning, we propose a joint

capture interactions between adjacent characters, bigram features are also
applied in the joint model. To illustrate the effectiveness of NE-LP, we
conducted experiments on EHRs collected from the Shuguang Hospital Affiliated

the size of bars depends on galaxy properties. The known correlation between
bar semi-major-axis $a$ and galaxy stellar mass (or luminosity) is actually
*bimodal*: for $\log M_{\star} < 10.1$, bar size is almost independent of
stellar mass ($a \propto M_{\star}^{0.1}$), while it is a strong function for
higher masses ($a \propto M_{\star}^{0.6}$). Bar size is a slightly stronger
function of galaxy half-light radius $r_{e}$ and (especially) exponential disc
scale length $h$ ($a \propto h^{0.8}$). Correlations between stellar mass and
galaxy size can explain the bar-size--$M_{\star}$ correlation -- but only for
galaxies with $\log M_{\star} < 10.1$; at higher masses, there is an extra
dependence of bar size on $M_{\star}$ itself. Despite theoretical arguments
that the presence of gas can affect bar growth, there is no evidence for any
residual dependence of bar size on (present-day) gas mass fraction. The
traditional dependence of bar size on Hubble type (longer bars in early-type
discs) can be explained as a side-effect of stellar-mass--Hubble-type
correlations. Finally, I show that galaxy size ($r_{e}$ or $h$) can be modeled
as a function of stellar mass and both bar presence and bar size: barred
galaxies tend to be more extended than unbarred galaxies of the same mass, with
larger bars correlated with larger sizes.

measuring only a subset of the transmission matrix, called Sparse Field

mathematics to overcome the biases in the estimation of the ex-ante efficient
frontier. A density forecasting approach is used to measure the accuracy of
ex-ante estimates using the Berkowitz statistic, we develop this statistic to
increase its sensitivity to changes in the data generating process. The area of
risk-expected return space where the density forecasts are accurate, where
ex-post performance matches ex-ante estimates, is termed the consistency
region. Under the 'laboratory' conditions of a simulated multivariate normal
data set, we compute the consistency region and the estimated ex-post frontier.
Over different sample sizes used for estimation, the behaviour of the
consistency region is shown to be both intuitively reasonable and to enclose
the estimated ex-post frontier. Using actual data from the constituents of the
US Dow Jones 30 index, we show that the size of the consistency region is time
dependent and, in volatile conditions, may disappear. Using our development of
the Berkowitz statistic, we demonstrate the superior performance of an

The second point is the adequacy of Bayesian modeling for situations where the

Such a function $f_n$ is called monomial rotation symmetric (MRS). It was
proved in a $2012$ paper that for any MRS $f_n$ with $d=3,$ the sequence of
weights $\{w_k = wt(f_k):~k = 3, 4, \ldots\}$ satisfies a homogeneous linear
recursion with integer coefficients. This result was gradually generalized in
the following years, culminating around $2016$ with the proof that such
recursions exist for any rotation symmetric function $f_n.$ Recursions for
quadratic RS functions were not explicitly considered, since a $2009$ paper had
already shown that the quadratic weights themselves could be given by an
explicit formula. However, this formula is not easy to compute for a typical
quadratic function. This paper shows that the weight recursions for the
quadratic RS functions have an interesting special form which can be exploited
to solve various problems about these functions, for example, deciding exactly
which quadratic RS functions are balanced.

reproduce the core chemical profile derived for KIC 0862602, the 12C+alpha
nuclear reaction rate has to be increased by a factor of $\sim$ 10 during the
helium-core burning, and reduced by a factor of $\sim$ 1000 during the
following helium-shell burning, as compared with the standard predictions for
this rate. In addition, the main chemical structures derived for KIC 0862602
cannot be reconciled with our present knowledge of white dwarf formation. We
find that within our current understanding of white dwarf formation and
evolution, it is difficult to reproduce the most important
asteroseismologically-derived features of the chemical structure of KIC

several schemes for cross-validating ESNs and introduce an efficient algorithm

already quite fast ESN training remains constant (does not scale up with $k$)
in our proposed method of doing $k$-fold cross-validation. The component that
does scale linearly with $k$ starts dominating only in some not very common
situations. Thus in many situations $k$-fold cross-validation of ESNs can be
done for virtually the same time complexity as a simple single split
validation. Space complexity can also remain the same. We also discuss when the
proposed validation schemes for ESNs could be beneficial and empirically
investigate them on several different real-world datasets.

wait-and-see policy before any realization of uncertainty and then place a
here-and-now decision after the uncertainty has been observed. Two-stage
stochastic programming is a popular modeling paradigm for the optimization
under uncertainty that the decision-makers first specifies a probability
distribution, and then seek the best decisions to jointly optimize the
deterministic wait-and-see and expected here-and-now costs. In practice, such a
probability distribution may not be fully available but is probably observable
through an empirical dataset. Therefore, this paper studies distributionally
robust two-stage stochastic program (DRTSP) which jointly optimizes the
deterministic wait-and-see and worst-case expected here-and-now costs, and the
probability distribution comes from a family of distributions which are
centered at the empirical distribution using $\infty-$Wasserstein metric. There
have been successful developments on deriving tractable approximations of the
worst-case expected here-and-now cost in DRTSP. Unfortunately, limited results
on exact tractable reformulations of DRTSP. This paper fills this gap by
providing sufficient conditions under which the worst-case expected
here-and-now cost in DRTSP can be efficiently computed via a tractable convex
program. By exploring the properties of binary variables, the developed
reformulation techniques are extended to DRTSP with binary random parameters.
The main tractable reformulations in this paper are projected into the original
decision space and thus can be interpreted as conventional two-stage stochastic
programs under discrete support with extra penalty terms enforcing the
robustness. These tractable results are further demonstrated to be sharp
through complexity analysis.

the solar photosphere. Their place in the hierarchy of convective structures
and their origin remain poorly understood (Rincon et al., 2018). Estimating
supergranular depth is of particular interest since this may help point to the
underlying physics. However, their subsurface velocity profiles have proven
difficult to ascertain. Birch et al. (2006) had suggested that helioseismic
inferences would benefit from an ensemble average over multiple realizations of
supergranules due to the reduction in realization noise. Bhattacharya et al.
(2017) used synthetic forward-modelled seismic wave travel times and
demonstrated the potential of helioseismic inversions at recovering the flow
profile of an average supergranule that is separable in the horizontal and
vertical directions, although the premise of this calculation has since been
challenged by Ferret (2019). In this work we avoid this assumption and carry
out a validation test of helioseismic travel-time inversions starting from
plausible synthetic non-separable profiles of an average supergranule. We
compute seismic wave travel times and sensitivity kernels by simulating wave
propagation through this background. We find that, while the ability to recover
the exact profile degrades based on the number of parameters involved, we are
nevertheless able to recover the peak depth of our models in a few iterations
where the measurements are presumably above the noise cutoff. This represents
an important step towards unraveling the physics behind supergranules, as we
start appreciating the parameters that we may reliably infer from a
time-distance helioseismic inversion.

that the rms amplitude of the lower kHz QPO increases with energy up to
$\sim12$ keV and then decreases at higher energies, while the rms amplitude of

The rms amplitude of the lower kHz QPO increases and then decreases with
frequency, peaking at $\sim 760$ Hz, while the amplitude of the upper kHz QPO
decreases with frequency, with a local maximum at around $\sim 770$ Hz, and is
consistent with becoming zero at the same QPO frequency, $\sim1400$ Hz, in all

at the inner edge of the accretion disc. We show that the slope of the rms

different energy bands as its frequencies change. Finally, we discuss a
possible mechanism responsible for the radiative properties of the kHz QPOs

on species R*s, the minimum resource values required for a species to persist.
A central assumption of the theory is that all species have equal access to
resources. However, many systems are characterized by preemption exploitation,
where some species deplete resources before their competitors can access them
(e.g., asymmetric light competition, contest competition among animals). We
hypothesize that coexistence under preemption requires an R*-preemption
tradeoff, i.e., the species with the priority access should have a higher R*
(lower efficiency). Thus, we developed an extension of resource competition
theory to investigate partial and total preemption (in the latter, the
preemptor is unaffected by species with lower preemption rank). We found that
an R*-preemption tradeoff is a necessary condition for coexistence in all
models. Moreover, under total preemption, the tradeoff alone is sufficient for
coexistence. In contrast, under partial preemption, more conditions are needed,
which restricts the parameter space of coexistence. Finally, we discussed the
implications of our finding for seemingly distinct tradeoffs, which we view as
special cases of R*-preemption tradeoff. These tradeoffs include the
digger-grazer, the competition-colonization, and tradeoffs related to light
competition between trees and understories.

  finite-volume discrete Boltzmann method",,,"10.1103/PhysRevE.101.063301",,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new implicit BGK collision model using a semi-Lagrangian approach is
proposed in this paper. Unlike existing models, in which the implicit BGK
collision is resolved either by a temporal extrapolation or by a variable
transformation, the new model removes the implicitness by tracing the particle
distribution functions (PDFs) back in time along their characteristic paths
during the collision process. An interpolation scheme is needed to evaluate the
PDFs at the traced-back locations. By using the first-order interpolation, the
resulting model allows for the straightforward replacement of
${f_{\alpha}}^{eq,n+1}$ by ${f_{\alpha}}^{eq,n}$ no matter where it appears.
After comparing the new model with the existing models under different
numerical conditions (e.g. different flux schemes and time marching schemes)
and using the new model to successfully modify the variable transformation
technique, three conclusions can be drawn. First, the new model can improve the
accuracy by almost an order of magnitude. Second, it can slightly reduce the
computational cost. Therefore, the new scheme improves accuracy without extra
cost. Finally, the new model can significantly improve the ${\Delta}t/{\tau}$
limit compared to the temporal interpolation model while having the same
${\Delta}t/{\tau}$ limit as the variable transformation approach. The new
scheme with a second-order interpolation is also developed and tested; however,
that technique displays no advantage over the simple first-order interpolation
approach. Both numerical and theoretical analyses are also provided to explain
why the new implicit scheme with simple first-order interpolation can
outperform the same scheme with second-order interpolation, as well as the
existing temporal extrapolation and variable transformation schemes.

constructing a dynamical slave-boson mean-field theory in the limit of large
lattice coordination number $z$ that incorporates the binding between doubly
occupied (doublon) and empty (holon) sites. On the Mott insulating side where
all doublons and holons bond in real space into excitonic pairs leading to the
charge gap, the theory simplifies considerably to leading order in
$1/\sqrt{z}$, and becomes exact on the infinite-$z$ Bethe lattice. An
asymptotic solution is obtained for a continuous Mott transition associated
with the closing of the charge gap at a critical value of the Hubbard $U_c$ and
the corresponding doublon density $n_d^c$, hopping $\chi_d^c$ and doublon-holon
pairing $\Delta_d^c$ amplitudes. We find $U_c=U_{\rm BR} [1 -2n_d^c -\sqrt{z}
(\chi_d^c +\Delta_d^c))] \simeq0.8U_{\rm BR}$, where $U_{\rm BR}$ is the
critical value for the Brinkman-Rice transition in the Gutzwiller approximation
captured in the static mean-field solution of the slave-boson formulation of
Kotliar and Ruckenstein. Thus, the Mott transition can be viewed as the quantum
correction to the Brinkman-Rice transition due to doublon-holon binding.
Quantitative comparisons are made to the results of the dynamical mean-field
theory, showing good agreement. In the absence of magnetic order, the Mott
insulator is a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid with nonzero intersite spinon hopping
that survives the large-$z$ limit and lifts the $2^N$-fold degeneracy of the
local moments. We show that the spinons are coupled to the doublons/holons by a
dissipative compact $U(1)$ gauge field in the deconfined phase, realizing the
spin-charge separated gapless spin liquid Mott insulator.

inner states. In this work, inspired by the fact that human brain acts like a
state machine, we proposed a novel encoding framework that combines information
from both the external world and the inner state to predict brain activity. The
framework comprises two parts: forward encoding model that deals with visual
stimuli and inner state model that captures influence from intrinsic
connections in the brain. The forward model can be any traditional encoding
model, making the framework flexible. The inner state model is a linear model
to utilize information in the prediction residuals of the forward model. The
proposed encoding framework can achieve much better performance on natural
image identification from fMRI response than forwardonly models. The
identification accuracy will decrease slightly with the dataset size
increasing, but remain relatively stable with different identification methods.
The results confirm that the new encoding framework is effective and robust

masses and radii for objects going from Globular Clusters (GCs) to ETGs and
GCGs, we set up the MR-plane and compare the observed distribution with the MRR
predicted by theoretical models both for the monolithic and hierarchical
scenarios. Results. We argue that the distributions of stellar systems in the
MR-plane is due to complementary mechanisms: (i) on one hand, as shown in paper
II, the relation of the virial equilibrium does intersect with a relation that
provides the total luminosity as a function of the star formation history; (ii)
on the other hand, the locus predicted for the collapse of systems should be
convolved with the statistical expectation for the maximum mass of the halos at
each comsic epoch. This second aspect provides a natural boundary limit
explaining either the curved distribution observed in the MR-plane and the
existence of a zone of avoidance. Conclusions. The distribution of stellar
systems in the MR-plane is the result of two combined evolution, that of the
stellar component and that of the halo component.

with temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A
type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is used
due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach
uses, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, not
necessarily the rectangular one, at the stage preceding spectral estimation.
Krylov matrices are employed for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation,
when a short time window of $1$ second is employed in power recordings. In
speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results with
respect to both time complexity and accuracy. Moreover, the impact of different
temporal windows is studied. The results show that even the most trivial
methods for ENF estimation, such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform, can
provide better results than the most recent state-of-the-art methods, when a
temporal window is employed. The correlation coefficient is used to measure the

affiliation (Chile, East Asia, Europe, North America, or Other), and gender.
The analysis was conducted for both the Stage 1 rankings, which are based on
the preliminary scores from the reviewers, and the Stage 2 rankings, which are
based on the final scores from the reviewers after participating in a
face-to-face panel discussion. Analysis of the Stage 1 results shows that PIs
who submit an ALMA proposal in multiple cycles have systematically better
proposal ranks than PIs who have submitted proposals for the first time. In
terms of regional affiliation, PIs from Europe and North America have better
Stage 1 rankings than PIs from Chile and East Asia. Consistent with Lonsdale et
al. (2016), proposals led by men have better Stage 1 rankings than women when
averaged over all cycles. This trend was most noticeably present in Cycle 3,
but no discernible differences in the Stage 1 rankings are present in recent
cycles. Nonetheless, in each cycle to date, women have had a lower proposal
acceptance rate than men even after differences in demographics are considered.
Comparison of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 rankings reveal no significant changes in
the distribution of proposal ranks by experience level, regional affiliation,
or gender as a result of the panel discussions, although the proposal ranks for
East Asian PIs show a marginally significant improvement from Stage 1 to Stage
2 when averaged over all cycles. Thus any systematics in the proposal rankings
are introduced primarily in the Stage 1 process and not from the face-to-face
discussions.

completely understood, but evidence suggests that sensory pathways are
influenced by an infants pain experience. Research has shown that an infants
previous pain experiences lead to an increased, and likely abnormal, response
to subsequent painful stimuli. We are working to improve neonatal pain
detection through automated devices that continuously monitor an infant. The
current study outlines some of the initial steps we have taken to evaluate Near
Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) as a technology to detect neonatal pain. Our
findings may provide neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) practitioners with the
data necessary to monitor and perhaps better manage an abnormal pain response.
Methods: A prospective pilot study was conducted to evaluate nociceptive evoked
cortical activity in preterm infants. NIRS data were recorded for approximately
10 minutes prior to an acute painful procedure and for approximately 10 minutes
after the procedure. Individual data collection events were performed at a
weekly maximum frequency. Eligible infants included those admitted to the Tampa
General Hospital (TGH) NICU with a birth gestational age of less than 37 weeks.
Results: A total of 15 infants were enrolled and 25 individual studies were
completed. Analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between
the median of the pre- and post-painful procedure data sets in each infants
first NIRS collection (p value = 0.01). Conclusions: Initial analysis shows
NIRS may be useful in detecting acute pain. An acute painful procedure is
typically followed by a negative deflection in NIRS readings.

to curtailment, especially if existing network infrastructure is insufficient
and energy generated cannot be exported. In this context, Distribution Network
Operators (DNOs) face a significant knowledge gap about how to implement
curtailment rules that achieve desired operational objectives, but at the same
time minimise disruption and economic losses for renewable generators. In this
work, we study the properties of several curtailment rules widely used in UK
renewable energy projects, and their effect on the viability of renewable
generation investment. Moreover, we propose a new curtailment rule which
guarantees fair allocation of curtailment amongst all generators with minimal
disruption. Another key knowledge gap faced by DNOs is how to incentivise
private network upgrades, especially in settings where several generators can
use the same line against the payment of a transmission fee. In this work, we
provide a solution to this problem by using tools from algorithmic game theory.
Specifically, this setting can be modelled as a Stackelberg game between the
private transmission line investor and local renewable generators, who are
required to pay a transmission fee to access the line. We provide a method for
computing the empirical equilibrium of this game, using a model that captures
the stochastic nature of renewable energy generation and demand. Finally, we
use the practical setting of a grid reinforcement project from the UK and a
large dataset of wind speed measurements and demand to validate our model. We
show that charging a transmission fee as a proportion of the feed-in tariff
price between 15%-75% would allow both investors to implement their projects
and achieve desirable distribution of the profit.

percentages of in-gap, L-shape and S-shape states vary in the three samples,
the total volume fraction of the three electronic states is quite similar. This

(Cr0.04) doped into the 122 compound. By combining the volume fractions of the
three states, the local density of states (LDOS), magnetic field dependent
behavior and global properties in these three samples, the in-gap state is
confirmed as a magnetic impurity state from the Co or Ni dopants. In addition,
the L-shape state is identified as a spin density wave (SDW) which competes
with the SC phase, and the S-shape state is found to be another form of
magnetic order which constructively cooperates with the SC phase, rather than
competing with it. The comparison of the vortex structures indicates that the
inhomogeneous electronic states serve as pinning centers for stabilizing the

incentivising private investors to participate in network investments. In this
paper, we study settings where a private renewable investor constructs a power
line, but also provides access to other generators that pay a transmission fee.
The decisions on optimal (and interdependent) renewable capacities built by

can be formulated as a Stackelberg game. Optimal capacities rely jointly on
stochastic variables, such as the renewable resource at project location. In
this paper, we show how Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Gibbs sampling

analytical methods that depend on whether safety or liveness requirements are
considered. Complexity is abstracted through different techniques, ranging from
stochastic modelling to contracts. However, both distributed heuristics and
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches as well as the user perspective
or unpredictable effects, such as accidents or the weather, introduce enough
uncertainty to warrant reinforcement-learning-based approaches. This paper
compares traditional approaches in the domain of CPS modelling and analysis
with the AI researcher perspective to exploring unknown complex systems.

scalable, resilient, and cost effective object-based storage systems built on
RESTful web services. However, many applications rely on richer file-system
APIs and semantics, and cannot benefit from object stores. This leads to
storage sprawl, as object stores are deployed alongside file systems and data
is accessed and managed across both systems in an ad-hoc fashion. We believe
there is a critical need for a transparent merger of objects and files,
consolidating data into a single platform. Such a merger would extend the
capabilities of both object and file stores while preserving existing semantics
and interfaces. In this position paper, we examine the viability of unifying
object stores and file systems, and the various design tradeoffs that exist.
Then, using our own implementation of an object-based, POSIX-complete file
system, we experimentally demonstrate several critical design considerations.

density for electrification of transportation and aviation. Anode-free cells
are the limiting case of lithium metal cells involving no excess lithium and
the highest possible specific energy. In addition, anode-free cells are easier,
cheaper and safer as they avoid handling and manufacturing of lithium metal
foils. Issues related to dendrite growth and poor cycling are magnified in
anode-free cells due to lack of excess lithium. Electrolyte and current
collector surface play a crucial role in affecting the cycling performance of
anode-free cells. In this work, we have computationally screened for candidate
current collectors that can nucleate lithium effectively and allow uniform
growth. These are determined by the free energy of lithium adsorption and
lithium surface diffusion barrier on candidate current collectors. Using
density functional theory calculations, we show that Li-alloys possess ideal
characteristics for Li nucleation and growth. These can lead to vastly improved
specific energy compared to current transition metal current collectors.

the robot's safety and reliability. Unlike liquid-fuel, a battery, as a
chemical device, exhibits complicated features, including (i) capacity fade
over successive recharges and (ii) increasing discharge rate as the state of
charge (SOC) goes down for a given power demand. Existing formal verification
studies of autonomous robots, when considering energy constraints, formalise
the energy component in a generic manner such that the battery features are
overlooked. In this paper, we model an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection
mission on a wind farm and via probabilistic model checking in PRISM show (i)
how the battery features may affect the verification results significantly in
practical cases; and (ii) how the battery features, together with dynamic
environments and battery safety strategies, jointly affect the verification
results. Potential solutions to explicitly integrate battery prognostics and
health management (PHM) with formal verification of autonomous robots are also
discussed to motivate future work.

  detecting short-chain fatty-acids: Technical Report","Technical Report",,,,"physics.ins-det eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate and butyrate,
are organic fatty-acids that are produced when indigested carbohydrates are
fermented in the colon by gut-bacteria. Butyrate is especially considered a
beneficial compound in relation to gut health and the maintenance of colonic
homeostasis. Little is known about butyrate production and the current
measurement methods of fecal samples are not representative and there is a
strong unmet need to measure SCFAs in-vivo to further understand their role and
effect on colonic function in human gut health and disease. The general aim of
the project is to develop a novel sensor based on infrared technology that is
capable of online detecting short chain fatty acids (SCFA; e.g. acetate,
propionate and butyrate) and other small biomolecules (e.g. ammonium) produced
in bioreactors. Whereas currently such levels of small biomolecules are usually
not detected online due to practical constraints (sampling-analysis-processing
of data), reliable online detection could significantly decrease analysis
costs. Further, it would allow to perform online quality control of the
bioreactors and allow to e.g. detect deviating values at an early stage. Hence,
one can react much faster tackling certain problems which will further improve
the quality of each experiment. Using machine learning algorithms to process
the sensor signals, the results from testing in a so-called artificial gut
setup are described in this technical report.
