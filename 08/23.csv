can we accurately predict missing ratings considering different data contexts
of entities? Many previous studies proved that utilizing the additional
information with rating data is helpful to improve the performance. However,
existing methods are limited in that 1) they ignore the fact that data contexts
of rating and auxiliary matrices are different, 2) they have restricted
capability of expressing independence information of users or items, and 3)
they assume the relation between a user and an item is linear. We propose
DaConA, a neural network based method for recommendation with a rating matrix
and an auxiliary matrix. DaConA is designed with the following three main
ideas. First, we propose a data context adaptation layer to extract pertinent
features for different data contexts. Second, DaConA represents each entity
with latent interaction vector and latent independence vector. Unlike previous
methods, both of the two vectors are not limited in size. Lastly, while
previous matrix factorization based methods predict missing values through the
inner-product of latent vectors, DaConA learns a non-linear function of them
via a neural network. We show that DaConA is a generalized algorithm including
the standard matrix factorization and the collective matrix factorization as
special cases. Through comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets, we
show that DaConA provides the state-of-the-art accuracy.

by how much the advantage can change. Typically, the temperature has been
measured for individual positions within specific games. In this paper, we give
the first general upper bounds on the temperature for any class of games.
  For a position $G$, the closure of the set of numbers $\{g\}$ such that $G-g$
is a first player win, is called the confusion interval of $G$. Let $\ell(G)$
be the length of this interval. Our first main result is: For a class of games
$\mathscr{S}$, if there are constants $J$ and $K$ such that
$\ell(G^L),\ell(G^R)\leq J$ and $\ell(G)\leq K$ for for every $G\in
\mathscr{S}$, then the temperature of every game is bounded by $K/2+J$. We give
an example to show that this bound is tight.
  Our second main result is a method to find a bound for the confusion
intervals. In $G^L-G$ when Left gets to go first, the number of passing moves
required by Right to win gives an upper bound on $\ell(G)$.
  This is the first general upper bound on temperature. As examples of the
bound and the method, we give upper bounds on the temperature of subclasses of

Some time ago it was pointed out by one of the authors that a dramatic

fact that waves propagate in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric
where, contrary to some wide-spread belief, a simple harmonic function with a
red-shifted frequency is not a solution of the equation of motion. At the first
non-trivial order, proper solutions have an effective wave number that differs
from the frequency. This leads to some interesting effects in Pulsar Timing
Arrays whose most visible manifestation is the enhancement of the signal that,
all other parameters kept fixed, is related in a simple manner to the value of
$H_0$. In this work, we rederive in an alternative way the main results, extend
the formalism to a more realistic setting where all components in the
cosmological budget are included, investigate in detail the dependence of the
signal on the various parameters involved and propose an observational set-up

  There are, however, a multiplicity of ways in which the Shapley value is

periciliary fluid (PCF) bathing the epithelium, and travel upwards via
advection towards the nose and mouth, as the mucus escalator entrains the PCF.
While many mathematical models (MMs) to date have described the course of
influenza A virus (IAV) infections in vivo, none have considered the impact of
both diffusion and advection on the kinetics and localization of the infection.
The MM herein represents the HRT as a one-dimensional track extending from the
nose down to a depth of 30 cm, wherein stationary cells interact with the
concentration of IAV which move along within the PCF. When IAV advection and
diffusion are both considered, the former is found to dominate infection
kinetics, and a 10-fold increase in the virus production rate is required to
counter its effects. The MM predicts that advection prevents infection from
disseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Because virus is
entrained upwards, the upper HRT sees the most virus, whereas the lower HRT
sees far less. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than
in the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the
upper towards the lower HRT. When the spatial MM is expanded to include
cellular regeneration and an immune response, it can capture the time course of
infection with a seasonal and an avian IAV strain by shifting parameters in a
manner consistent with what is expected to differ between these two types of
infection. The impact of antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors was
also investigated. This new MM offers a convenient and unique platform from
which to study the localization and spread of respiratory viral infections
within the HRT.

developed for time series analysis using a meta-learning approach. This system
selects the best forecasting method with consideration of the time series
characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to focusing on some
of the unanswered questions resulting from the use of meta-learning in time
series forecasting. Therefore, three main gaps in previous works are addressed
including, analyzing various subsets of top forecasters as inputs for
meta-learners; evaluating the effect of forecasting error measures; and
assessing the role of the dimensionality of the feature space on the
forecasting errors of meta-learners. All of these objectives are achieved with
the help of a diverse state-of-the-art pool of forecasters and meta-learners.
For this purpose, first, a pool of forecasting algorithms is implemented on the
NN5 competition dataset and ranked based on the two error measures. Then, six
machine-learning classifiers known as meta-learners, are trained on the
extracted features of the time series in order to assign the most suitable
forecasting method for the various subsets of the pool of forecasters.
Furthermore, two-dimensionality reduction methods are implemented in order to
investigate the role of feature space dimension on the performance of
meta-learners. In general, it was found that meta-learners were able to defeat
all of the individual benchmark forecasters; this performance was improved even
after applying the feature selection method.

measure $W^+$/$W^-$ in a more forward region ranging from 1.0 $< \eta <$1.5,
which extends the sea quark sensitivity to higher $x$. RHIC runs from 2011

Buchstaber and Tertychnyi described those parameter values, for which the
corresponding equation has a polynomial solution. They have shown that for
$\mu\neq0$ this happens exactly when $l\in\mathbb N$ and the parameters
$(\lambda,\mu)$ lie on an algebraic curve $\Gamma_l\subset\mathbb
C^2_{(\lambda,\mu)}$ called the $l$-th spectral curve and defined as zero locus
of determinant of a remarkable three-diagonal $l\times l$-matrix. They studied
the real spectral curves and obtained important results with applications to
phase-lock areas in model of Josephson junction, which is a family of dynamical
systems on 2-torus. In the present paper we prove irreducibility of complex
spectral curves. We also calculate their genera for $l\leqslant20$ and present
a conjecture on general genus formula. We apply the irreducibility result to
the phase-lock areas, which are those level sets of the rotation number
function $\rho$ on the parameter space of the above-mentioned family of
dynamical systems that have non-empty interiors. The family of their boundaries
is a countable union of analytic surfaces. We show that, unexpectedly, its
complexification is a complex analytic subset consisting of just four
irreducible components, and we describe them. We present a Monotonicity
Conjecture on the evolution of the phase-lock area portraits and a partial
positive result towards its confirmation.

Partial Last-In-First-Out Loading Constraints (DTSPPL). It is a
pickup-and-delivery single-vehicle routing problem, where all pickup operations
must be performed before any delivery one because the pickup and delivery areas
are geographically separated. The vehicle collects items in the pickup area and
loads them into its container, a horizontal stack. After performing all pickup
operations, the vehicle begins delivering the items in the delivery area.
Loading and unloading operations must obey a partial Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
policy, i.e., a version of the LIFO policy that may be violated within a given
reloading depth. The objective of the DTSPPL is to minimize the total cost,
which involves the total distance traveled by the vehicle and the number of
items that are unloaded and then reloaded due to violations of the standard
LIFO policy. We formally describe the DTSPPL through two Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) formulations and propose a heuristic algorithm based on the
Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to find high-quality solutions. The
performance of the proposed solution approaches is assessed over a broad set of
instances. Computational results have shown that both ILP formulations have
been able to solve only the smaller instances, whereas the BRKGA obtained good
quality solutions for almost all instances, requiring short computational

  We observed HD 32297 with SPHERE in Y, J, and H bands in total intensity and
in J band in polarimetry. The observations are compared to synthetic models of
debris disks and we developed methods to extract the photometry in total
intensity overcoming the data-reduction artifacts, namely the self-subtraction.
The spectro-photometric measurements averaged along the disk mid-plane are then
compared to model spectra of various grain compositions.
  These new images reveal the very inner part of the system as close as 0.15"".
The disk image is mostly dominated by the forward scattering making one side
(half-ellipse) of the disk more visible, but observations in total intensity
are deep enough to also detect the back side for the very first time. The
images as well as the surface brightness profiles of the disk rule out the
presence of a gap as previously proposed. We do not detect any significant
asymmetry between the northeast and southwest sides of the disk. The spectral
reflectance features a ""gray to blue"" color which is interpreted as the
presence of grains far below the blowout size.
  The presence of sub-micron grains in the disk is suspected to be the result
of gas drag and/or ""avalanche mechanisms"". The blue color of the disk could be
further investigated with additional total intensity and polarimetric
observations in K and H bands respectively to confirm the spectral slope and
the fraction of polarization.

manifolds has been related to geometric actions which generally arise in the
coadjoint orbit method in representation theory and play an important role in
geometric quantization. On the other hand, it is known that there exists a
precise relation between geometric actions and Berry phases defined in group
representations. Motivated by these connections, we elaborate on a relation
between circuit complexity and the group theoretic Berry phase. As the simplest
setup relevant for holography, we discuss the case of two dimensional conformal
field theories. In the large central charge limit, we identify the
computational cost function with the Berry connection in the unitary
representation of the Virasoro group. We then use the latter identification to
express the Berry phase in terms of the Virasoro circuit complexity. The former
can be seen as the holonomy of the Berry connection along the path in the group
manifold which defines the protocol. In addition, we derive a proportionality
relation between Virasoro circuit complexity and the logarithm of the inner
product between a particularly chosen reference state and the prepared target
state. In this sense, the logarithmic formula turns out to be approximating the
complexity up to some additive constant if the building blocks of the circuit
are taken to be the underlying symmetry gates. Predictions based on this
formula have recently been shown to coincide with the holographic complexity
proposals and the path integral optimization procedure. The found connections
may therefore help to better understand such coincidences. We also discuss that
our findings, put together with earlier observations, may suggest a connection
between the Virasoro Berry phase and the complexity measure in the path
integral optimization proposal.

the existence of a second order EPD in a time-varying single resonator.

and the time required to execute them at runtime, prohibit their use in

diverse knowledge from different trained (teacher) models, we propose to use

major criteria characterizing the performance of a power amplifier in the

amplifiers are known to have a very high efficiency, yet they have rarely been
adopted in the instrumental development of MECT. In addition, switch-mode power
amplifiers themselves are lacking in the research literature for MSF
capability. In this article, a Class D power amplifier is designed so as to
address the two issues. An MSF selective harmonic elimination pulsewidth
modulation method is proposed to generate alternating magnetic fields, which

experimental system has been developed to verify the design. Results show that
the proposed methodology is capable of generating high MSF currents in the

subhaloes is crucial for understanding galaxy formation, modeling galaxy

nature of subhalo evolution, cosmological $N$-body simulations remain its
primary method of investigation. However, it has recently been demonstrated
that such simulations are still heavily impacted by artificial disruption,
diminishing the information content on small scales and reducing the
reliability of all simulation-calibrated semi-analytical models. In this paper,
we utilize the recently released DASH library of high-resolution, idealized
simulations of the tidal evolution of subhaloes, which are unhindered by
numerical overmerging due to discreteness noise or force softening, to
calibrate an improved, more-accurate model of the evolution of the density
profiles of subhaloes that undergo tidal heating and stripping within their
host halo. By testing previous findings that the structural evolution of a
tidally truncated subhalo depends solely on the fraction of mass stripped,
independent of the details of the stripping, we identify an additional
dependence on the initial subhalo concentration. We provide significantly
improved fitting functions for the subhalo density profiles and structural
parameters ($V_\mathrm{max}$ and $r_\mathrm{max}$) that are unimpeded by
numerical systematics and applicable to a wide range of parameter space. This
model will be an integral component of a future semi-analytical treatment of
substructure evolution, which can be used to predict key quantities, such as
the evolved subhalo mass function and annihilation boost factors, and validate
such calculations performed with cosmological simulations.

self-consistent multimass models with a varying mass function and content of
stellar remnants, which we fit to various observational constraints. Our
best-fitting model successfully matches the observables and correctly predicts
the radial distribution of millisecond pulsars and their gravitational
accelerations inferred from long-term timing observations. The data favours a
population of BHs with a total mass of $430^{+386}_{-301}$ $M_{\odot}$, but the
most likely model has very few BHs. Since our models do not include a central
IMBH and accurately reproduce the observations, we conclude that there is
currently no need to invoke the presence of an IMBH in 47 Tuc. The global
present-day mass function inferred is significantly depleted in low-mass stars
(power-law slope $\alpha=-0.52^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$). Given the orbit and predicted
mass-loss history of this massive GC, the dearth of low-mass stars is difficult
to explain with a standard initial mass function (IMF) followed by long-term
preferential escape of low-mass stars driven by two-body relaxation, and
instead suggests that 47 Tuc may have formed with a bottom-light IMF. We
discuss alternative evolutionary origins for the flat mass function and ways to
reconcile this with the low BH retention fraction. Finally, by capturing the
effect of dark remnants, our method offers a new way to probe the IMF in a GC
above the current main-sequence turn-off mass, for which we find a slope of
$-2.49\pm0.08$.

critical point in the QCD phase diagram in fluctuation observables. To
understand and predict these signatures, one must account for the fact that the
dynamics of any critical fluctuations must be out-of-equilibrium: because of
critical slowing down, the fluctuations cannot stay in equilibrium as the
droplet of QGP produced in a collision expands and cools. Furthermore, their
out-of-equilibrium dynamics must also influence the hydrodynamic evolution of
the cooling droplet. The recently developed Hydro+ formalism allows for a
consistent description of both the hydrodynamics and the out-of-equilibrium
fluctuations, including the feedback between them. We shall explicitly
demonstrate how this works, setting up a Hydro+ simulation in a simplified
setting: a rapidity-independent fireball undergoing radial flow with an
equation of state in which we imagine a critical point close to the $\mu_B=0$
axis of the phase diagram. Within this setup, we show that we can
quantitatively capture non-equilibrium phenomena, including critical
fluctuations over a range of scales and memory effects. Furthermore, we
illustrate the interplay between the dynamics of the fluctuations and the
hydrodynamic flow of the fireball: as the fluid cools and flows, the dynamical
fluctuations lag relative to how they would evolve if they stayed in
equilibrium; there is then a backreaction on the flow itself due to the
out-of-equilibrium fluctuations; and, in addition, the radial flow transports
fluctuations outwards by advection. Within our model, we find that the
backreaction from the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations does not yield
dramatically large effects in the hydrodynamic variables. Further work will be
needed in order to check this quantitative conclusion in other settings but, if
it persists, this will considerably simplify future modelling.

as valence bond solid (VBS) phases, can host topological defects carrying
non-trivial quantum numbers, which enables the paradigm of deconfined quantum
criticality. In this work, we study the properties of topological defects in
valence plaquette solid (VPS) phases on square and cubic lattices. We show that
the defects of the VPS order parameter, in addition to possessing non-trivial
quantum numbers, have fracton mobility constraints deep in the VPS phase, which
has been overlooked previously. The spinon inside a single vortex cannot move
freely in any direction, while a dipolar pair of vortices with spinon pairs can
only move perpendicular to its dipole moment. These mobility constraints, while
they persist, can potentially inhibit the condensation of vortices and preclude
a continuous transition from the VPS to the N\'eel antiferromagnet. Instead,
the VPS melting transition can be driven by proliferation of spinon dipoles.
For example, we argue that a $2d$ VPS can melt into a stable gapless phase in
the form of an algebraic bond liquid with algebraic correlations and long range
entanglement. Such a bond liquid phase yields a concrete example of the elusive
$2d$ Bose metal with symmetry fractionalization. We also study $3d$ valence
plaquette and valence cube ordered phase, and demonstrate that the topological
defects therein also have fractonic dynamics. Possible nearby phases after
melting the valence plaquettes or cubes are also discussed.

(BRs): bands whose infinitely-numbered Wannier functions are generated (by
action of a space group) from a finite number of symmetric Wannier functions
centered on a point in space. This work aims to simplify questions on a
multi-rank BR by splitting it into unit-rank bands, via the following
crystallographic splitting theorem: being a rank-$N$ BR is equivalent to being
splittable into a finite sum of bands indexed by $\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$, such that
each band is spanned by a single, analytic Bloch function of $k$, and any
symmetry in the space group acts by permuting $\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$. Applying this
theorem, we develop computationally efficient methods to determine whether a
given energy band (of a tight-binding or Schr\""odinger Hamiltonian) is a BR,
and, if so, how to numerically construct the corresponding symmetric Wannier
functions. Thus we prove that rotation-symmetric topological insulators in
class AI are fragile, meaning that the obstruction to symmetric Wannier
functions is removable by addition of BRs. An implication of fragility is that
its boundary states, while robustly covering the bulk energy gap in finite-rank
tight-binding models, are unstable if the Hilbert space is expanded to include
all symmetry-allowed representations. These fragile insulators have photonic
analogs that we identify; in particular, we prove that an existing photonic
crystal built by Yang et al. [Nature 565, 622 (2019)] is fragile topological
with removable surface states, which disproves a widespread perception of
'topologically-protected' surface states in time-reversal-invariant, gapped
photonic/phononic crystals. Our theorem is finally applied to derive various
symmetry obstructions on the Wannier functions of topological insulators, and
to prove their equivalence with the nontrivial holonomy of Bloch functions.

beginning at $z=8$ the CGM grows systematically more neutral owing to
self-shielding. Weak absorbers trace diffuse gas that lies farther from halos,
hence they are ionized first, whereas stronger systems are less sensitive to
reionization. The overall OI covering fraction decreases slowly with time owing
to competition between ongoing enrichment and gradual encroachment of
ionization fronts into increasingly overdense gas. While the declining covering
fraction is partially offset by continued formation of new halos, the
ionization of the diffuse gas causes the predicted line-of-sight incidence rate
of OI absorbers to decline abruptly at the overlap epoch, in qualitative
agreement with observations. In comparison to the recently-observed equivalent
width (EW) distribution at $z\approx6$, the simulations underproduce systems

release of the Dark Energy Survey (DES DR1) with the Sidney University Molonglo
Survey (SUMSS) radio catalog at 0.843 GHz. This object is the first radio-loud
AGN at high redshift discovered in the DES. The radio properties of DES0141-54,
namely its very large radio-loudness (R>10$^{4}$), the high radio luminosity
(L$_{0.8 GHz}$=1.73$\times$10$^{28}$ W Hz$^{-1}$), and the flatness of the
radio spectrum ($\alpha$=0.35) up to very high frequencies (120 GHz in the
source's rest frame), classify this object as a blazar, meaning, a radio-loud
AGN observed along the relativistic jet axis. However, the X--ray luminosity of
DESJ0141-54 is much lower compared to those of the high redshift (z$\geq$4.5)
blazars discovered so far. Moreover its X-ray-to-radio luminosity ratio
(log($\frac{L_{[0.5-10]keV}}{L_{1.4GHz}}$)=9.96$\pm$0.30 Hz) is small also when
compared to lower redshift blazars: only 2\% of the low-z population has a
similar ratio. By modeling the spectral energy distribution we found that this
peculiar X--ray weakness and the powerful radio emission could be related to a
particularly high value of the magnetic field. Finally, the mass of the central
black hole is relatively small (M$_{BH}$ = 3-8 $\times$10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$)
compared to other confirmed blazars at similar redshift, making DES0141-54 the
radio-loud AGN that host the smallest supermassive black hole ever discovered

field and Joule heating in the switching process remain controversial. We
resolve this issue by studying nanowires of two archetypical Mott insulators -
VO2 and V2O3. Our findings show a crossover between two qualitatively different

temperature, while in the other, field-assisted carrier generation gives rise
to a doping driven IMT which is purely non-thermal. By identifying the key

spectral analyses of MKW 08 with archival XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray

power-law with a photon index of $\Gamma$ ~ 1.8 at the core of its BCG.
Although the ICM does not exhibit a cluster scale cool core, the BCG manifests
itself as a mini cool core characterized by a cooling time as short as 64 Myr
at r = 3 kpc centered at the galaxy. The isothermality of the BCG corona seems
to favor mechanical feedback from the central AGN as the major source of gas
heating. The gas pressure profile of this mini cool core suggests that the BCG
coronal gas reaches pressure equilibrium with the hotter and less dense ICM
inside an interface of nearly constant pressure, delimited by radii 4 < r < 10
kpc at the galactic center. As revealed by the presence of a metal enriched

in the query that are representative of the query's product intent. However,
the search engine may fail to retrieve results that satisfy the query's product

Hence, identifying the terms that describe the query's product intent and
predicting additional terms that describe the query's product intent better

between electricity demand and temperature changes in industrial areas in India
mainly due to the limitation of data. The precise role of industrial and
residential activities response to the temperature is not explored in
sub-tropical humid climate of India. Here, we show the temperature sensitivity
of industrial and residential areas in the city of Pune, Maharashtra by keeping
other influencing variables on electricity demand as constant. The study seeks
to estimate the behaviour of peak electricity demand with the apparent
temperature (AT) using the Extreme Value Theory. Our analysis shows that
industrial activities are not much influenced by the temperature whereas
residential activities show around 1.5-2% change in average electricity demand
with 1 degree rise in AT. Further, we show that peak electricity demand in
residential areas, performed using stationary and non-stationary GEV models,
are significantly influenced by the rise in temperature. The study shows that
with the improvement in data collection, better planning for the future
development, accounting for the climate change effects, will enhance the
effectiveness of electricity distribution system. The study is limited to the
geographical area of Pune. However, the methods are useful in estimating the
peak power load attributed to climate change to other geographical regions
located in subtropical and humid climate.

similar to nodes inside the set than outside, whereas communities define sets
of nodes with more connections inside the set than outside. Roles based on
structural similarity and communities based on proximity are fundamentally
different but important complementary notions. Recently, the notion of
structural roles has become increasingly important and has gained a lot of
attention due to the proliferation of work on learning representations
(node/edge embeddings) from graphs that preserve the notion of roles.
Unfortunately, recent work has sometimes confused the notion of structural
roles and communities (based on proximity) leading to misleading or incorrect
claims about the capabilities of network embedding methods. As such, this paper
seeks to clarify the misconceptions and key differences between structural
roles and communities, and formalize the general mechanisms (e.g., random
walks, feature diffusion) that give rise to community or role-based structural
embeddings. We theoretically prove that embedding methods based on these
mechanisms result in either community or role-based structural embeddings.
These mechanisms are typically easy to identify and can help researchers
quickly determine whether a method preserves community or role-based
embeddings. Furthermore, they also serve as a basis for developing new and
improved methods for community or role-based structural embeddings. Finally, we
analyze and discuss applications and data characteristics where community or
role-based embeddings are most appropriate.

that equilibrium points are stable, leading to fast convergence of the

without considering the mobility of mobile terminals (MTs). The problem is
solved by a hybrid Jacobian and Gauss-Seidel proximal multi-block alternating

converge to the optimal solution with a rate $O(1/k)$. Then we use the tool of
\textit{Markov renewal process} to predict the moving path and sojourn time for

the problem and prove that the developed algorithm has the same convergence

convergence analysis on proposed algorithms. Our real trace driven experiments
illustrate that the mobility-aware DRMTL model can provide a more accurate

spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the Type IIn supernova SN 2015da
(also known as PSN J13522411+3941286, or iPTF16tu). The supernova exploded in
the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5337 in a relatively highly extinguished
environment. The transient showed prominent narrow Balmer lines in emission at
all times and a slow rise to maximum in all bands. In addition, early
observations performed by amateur astronomers give a very well-constrained
explosion epoch. The observables are consistent with continuous interaction
between the supernova ejecta and a dense and extended H-rich circumstellar
medium. The presence of such an extended and dense medium is difficult to
reconcile with standard stellar evolution models, since the metallicity at the
position of SN 2015da seems to be slightly subsolar. Interaction is likely the
mechanism powering the light curve, as confirmed by the analysis of the pseudo
bolometric light curve, which gives a total radiated energy
$\gtrsim10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$. Modeling the light curve in the context of a
supernova shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium allowed us to
infer the mass of the prexisting gas to be $\simeq8\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$, with an
extreme mass-loss rate for the progenitor star
$\simeq0.6\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$, suggesting that most of the
circumstellar gas was produced during multiple eruptive events. Near- and
mid-infrared observations reveal a flux excess in these domains, similar to
those observed in SN 2010jl and other interacting transients, likely due to
preexisting radiatively heated dust surrounding the supernova. By modeling the
infrared excess, we infer a mass $\gtrsim0.4\times10^{-3}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ for
the dust.

spatial clues. Our method works in an alternative direction that lets
information flow backward from the last layer of the encoder towards the first.
The encoder performs encoding in the forward pass and the same network performs
decoding in the backward pass. Therefore, the encoder itself is also the
decoder. Compared to conventional encoder-decoder architectures, ours doesn't
require additional layers for decoding and further reuses the encoder weights
thereby reducing the total number of parameters required for processing. We

content of clusters of galaxies, also requires observations at very high
energies. An observatory type medium mission operating from around 1 keV to
about 600 keV can provide direct insights into these major questions. The
essential characteristics will be coverage of the full energy range by
telescopes featuring a large throughput and arc-second resolution optics,
coupled to a compact focal plane assembly, with excellent imaging resolution
and spectroscopy. In addition, the mission will provide unique polarimetry
measurements in the hard X-ray domain, an important new diagnostic tool at
energies for which the non-thermal processes dominate. The Polarimetric
High-Energy Modular Telescope Observatory (PHEMTO) is designed to have
performance several orders of magnitude better than the present hard X-ray
instruments. This gives to PHEMTO the improvements in scientific performance
needed for a mission in the 2050 era.

UNet architecture with a graph neural network (GNN) model. In this approach,
the convolutional layers at the deepest level of the UNet are replaced by a
GNN-based module with a series of graph convolutions. The dense feature maps at
this level are transformed into a graph input to the GNN module. The
incorporation of graph convolutions in the UNet provides nodes in the graph
with information that is based on node connectivity, in addition to the local
features learnt through the downsampled paths. This information can help
improve segmentation decisions. By stacking several graph convolution layers,
the nodes can access higher order neighbourhood information without substantial
increase in computational expense. We propose two types of node connectivity in
the graph adjacency: i) one predefined and based on a regular node
neighbourhood, and ii) one dynamically computed during training and using the
nearest neighbour nodes in the feature space. We have applied this method to
the task of segmenting the airway tree from chest CT scans. Experiments have
been performed on 32 CTs from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial dataset.
We evaluate the performance of the UNet-GNN models with two types of graph

Leveraging the economic structure of first- and second-price auctions, we first
show that the effects of advertising are identified by the optimal bids. Hence,
since these optimal bids are the only objects that need to be recovered, we
introduce an adapted Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm to solve a multi-armed
bandit problem that succeeds in recovering such bids and, consequently, the
effects of advertising while minimizing the costs of experimentation. We derive
a regret bound for our algorithm which is order optimal and use data from RTB

  screenings in the health sciences: a working paper","10 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Systematic reviews, which summarize and synthesize all the current research
in a specific topic, are a crucial component to academia. They are especially
important in the biomedical and health sciences, where they synthesize the
state of medical evidence and conclude the best course of action for various
diseases, pathologies, and treatments. Due to the immense amount of literature
that exists, as well as the output rate of research, reviewing abstracts can be
a laborious process. Automation may be able to significantly reduce this
workload. Of course, such classifications are not easily automated due to the
peculiar nature of written language. Machine learning may be able to help. This
paper explored the viability and effectiveness of using machine learning
modelling to classify abstracts according to specific exclusion/inclusion
criteria, as would be done in the first stage of a systematic review. The
specific task was performing the classification of deciding whether an abstract
is a randomized control trial (RCT) or not, a very common classification made
in systematic reviews in the healthcare field. Random training/testing splits
of an n=2042 dataset of labelled abstracts were repeatedly created (1000 times
in total), with a model trained and tested on each of these instances. A Bayes
classifier as well as an SVM classifier were used, and compared to non-machine
learning, simplistic approaches to textual classification. An SVM classifier
was seen to be highly effective, yielding a 90% accuracy, as well as an F1
score of 0.84, and yielded a potential workload reduction of 70%. This shows
that machine learning has the potential to significantly revolutionize the
abstract screening process in healthcare systematic reviews.

boundary cycles of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of
curves. Our formulae are derived from lattice point count involving the
Kontsevich volume polynomials that also appear in Mirzakhani's recursion for
the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of bordered hyperbolic Riemann
surfaces.
  A similar formula for the Masur-Veech volume (though without explicit
evaluation) was obtained earlier by Mirzakhani through completely different
approach. We prove further result: up to an explicit normalization factor
depending only on the genus and on the number of cusps, the density of the
orbit of any simple closed multicurve computed by Mirzakhani coincides with the
density of square-tiled surfaces having horizontal cylinder decomposition
associated to the simple closed multicurve.
  We study the resulting densities in more detail in the special case when
there are no cusps. In particular, we compute explicitly the asymptotic
frequencies of separating and non-separating simple closed geodesics on a
closed hyperbolic surface of genus g for all small genera g and we show that in
large genera the separating closed geodesics are exponentially less frequent.
  We conclude with detailed conjectural description of combinatorial geometry
of a random simple closed multicurve on a surface of large genus and of a
random square-tiled surface of large genus. This description is conditional to
the conjectural asymptotic formula for the Masur-Veech volume in large genera
and to the conjectural uniform asymptotic formula for certain sums of
intersection numbers of psi-classes in large genera.

a simple but effective way to explicitly represent and utilize groups (e.g.,
functional groups), which consist of the atom (node) tier, the group tier and
the molecule (graph) tier. They can be learned using the tiered graph
autoencoder architecture. In this paper we discuss adapting tiered graph
autoencoders for use with PyTorch Geometric, for both the deterministic tiered
graph autoencoder model and the probabilistic tiered variational graph
autoencoder model. We also discuss molecular structure information sources that
can be accessed to extract training data for molecular graphs. To support
transfer learning, a critical consideration is that the information must
utilize standard unique molecule and constituent atom identifiers. As a result
of using tiered graph autoencoders for deep learning, each molecular graph
possesses tiered latent representations. At each tier, the latent
representation consists of: node features, edge indices, edge features,
membership matrix, and node embeddings. This enables the utilization and
exploration of tiered molecular latent spaces, either individually (the node

the Lorentz force, which lead to brittle fracture of these ceramic-like
materials at high fields and, secondly, catastrophic thermal instabilities as a
result of flux movement during magnetization. Moreover, for a batch of samples
nominally fabricated identically, the statistical nature of the failure
mechanism means the best performance (i.e. trapped fields of over 17 T) cannot
be attained reliably. The magnetization process, particularly to higher fields,
also often damages the samples such that they cannot repeatedly trap high
fields following subsequent magnetization. In this study, we report the
sequential trapping of magnetic fields of ~ 17 T, achieving 16.8 T at 26 K

the security of its smart contracts. Many identified bugs and vulnerabilities
in smart contracts not only present challenges to maintenance of blockchain,
but also lead to serious financial loses. There is a significant need to better
assist developers in checking smart contracts and ensuring their reliability.In
this paper, we propose a web service tool, named SmartEmbed, which can help
Solidity developers to find repetitive contract code and clone-related bugs in
smart contracts. Our tool is based on code embeddings and similarity checking
techniques. By comparing the similarities among the code embedding vectors for
existing solidity code in the Ethereum blockchain and known bugs, we are able
to efficiently identify code clones and clone-related bugs for any solidity
code given by users, which can help to improve the users' confidence in the
reliability of their code. In addition to the uses by individual developers,
SmartEmbed can also be applied to studies of smart contracts in a large scale.
When applied to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum
blockchain, we found that the clone ratio of solidity code is close to 90\%,
much higher than traditional software, and 194 clone-related bugs can be
identified efficiently and accurately based on our small bug database with a

one popular family of ML models relying on $K$-nearest neighbors ($K$NN). The
most surprising result is that for unweighted $K$NN classifiers and regressors,
the Shapley value of all $N$ data points can be computed, exactly, in $O(N\log

physical models of shadow formation, we use a linear illumination
transformation to model the shadow effects in the image that allows the shadow
image to be expressed as a combination of the shadow-free image, the shadow
parameters, and a matte layer. We use two deep networks, namely SP-Net and
M-Net, to predict the shadow parameters and the shadow matte respectively. This
system allows us to remove the shadow effects on the images. We train and test
our framework on the most challenging shadow removal dataset (ISTD). Compared
to the state-of-the-art method, our model achieves a 40% error reduction in
terms of root mean square error (RMSE) for the shadow area, reducing RMSE from
13.3 to 7.9. Moreover, we create an augmented ISTD dataset based on an image
decomposition system by modifying the shadow parameters to generate new
synthetic shadow images. Training our model on this new augmented ISTD dataset
further lowers the RMSE on the shadow area to 7.4.

languages with a semantics. They provide the meaning of a closed term as a
process graph: a state in a labelled transition system. At the same time they
provide the meaning of an n-ary operator, or more generally an open term with n
free variables, as an n-ary operation on process graphs. The classical way of
doing this, the closed-term semantics, reduces the meaning of an open term to
the meaning of its closed instantiations. It makes the meaning of an operator
dependent on the context in which it is employed. Here I propose an alternative
process graph semantics of TSSs that does not suffer from this drawback.
Semantic equivalences on process graphs can be lifted to open terms conform
either the closed-term or the process graph semantics. For pure TSSs the latter
is more discriminating. I consider five sanity requirements on the semantics of
programming and specification languages equipped with a recursion construct:
compositionality, applied to n-ary operators, recursion and variables,
invariance under $\alpha$-conversion, and the recursive definition principle,
saying that the meaning of a recursive call should be a solution of the
corresponding recursion equations. I establish that the satisfaction of four of
these requirements under the closed-term semantics of a TSS implies their
satisfaction under the process graph semantics.

expected, in both cases the spectrum turns out to be simplified, since some

novel notion of configurations in the MPP model allowing differentiation of
agents and uses techniques similar to methods of analyzing encoding criteria,
namely operational correspondence. The constructional part of the proof is
generic in a way that all protocols can be translated into the new model

output. Furthermore, we illustrate how this approach could be utilized to prove

lower limits for TI and KI thresholds, which are $n_{\rm crit} = 1.3$ and

As a result, constraining paths of the robot to not interact with the
environment is not necessary and may be limiting. In this paper, we
mathematically formalize interactions of a soft growing robot with a planar
environment in an empirical kinematic model. Using this interaction model, we
develop a method to plan paths for the robot to a destination. Rather than
avoiding contact with the environment, the planner exploits obstacle contact

microprocessors in data centers to turbines and engines; active cooling is
essential in these situations. However, active transfer of heat or thermal
energy under a large temperature difference promptly destroys the exergy, which
is the free-energy component of thermal energy, and this issue has remained
unaddressed. Herein, we describe a thermoelectrochemical conversion to
partially recover presently lost exergy in forced convection cooling. We design
a test cell in which an electrolyte liquid is forced through a channel formed
between two parallel electrodes and the hot-side electrode simulates an object
to be cooled. Our investigations show that the narrower interelectrode channels
afford higher cooling and power generation performances. The mass transfer
resistance is the most dominant type of resistance for all the conditions
tested and the charge transfer kinetics is likely to be controlled by
viscosity. The dependence of the generated power on the flow rate is caused by
the change in the diffusion coefficient of redox species with temperature. As
an evaluation measure for such forced-flow thermocells, the gain (\Lambda)
--defined as the ratio of the generated power to the hydrodynamic pumping work
required to force the liquid through the cell-- is introduced. \Lambda is above
unity in a certain flow rate region. This demonstrates that such a system can
generate more electric power than the pump work required to drive the liquid
through the cell, suggesting its potential to partly recover presently lost

constructing a tree using a given metric, such trees will only display the
metric if it satisfies the so-called ""four point condition"", established by
Buneman in 1971. While this condition guarantees that a unique tree will
display the metric, meaning that the distance between any two leaves can be
found by adding the distances on arcs in the path between the leaves, it
doesn't exclude the possibility that a phylogenetic network might also display
the metric. This possibility was recently pointed out and ""tree-metrized""
networks --- that display a tree metric --- with a single reticulation were
characterized. In this paper, we show that in the case of HGT (horizontal gene
transfer) networks, in fact there are tree-metrized networks containing many
reticulations.

Understanding the trigger mechanisms of fast CMEs can help us gaining important
information in forecasting them. The filament eruptions accompanied with CMEs
provide a good tracer in studying the early evolution of CMEs. Here we surveyed
66 filament-accompanied fast CMEs to analyse the correlation between the
trigger mechanisms, namely either magnetic reconnection or ideal MHD process,
associated flares, and CME speeds. Based on the data gathering from SDO, GONG
and STEREO, we find that: (1) Active region (AR) filament and intermediate
filaments (IFs) eruptions show a higher probability for producing fast CMEs
than quiet Sun (QS) filaments, while the probability of polar crown (PC)
filament eruptions is zero in our statistic; (2) AR filament eruptions that
produce fast CMEs are more likely triggered by magnetic reconnection, while QS
and IFs are more likely triggered by ideal MHD process; (3) For AR filaments
and IFs, it seems that the specific trigger mechanism does not have a
significant influence on the resulted CME speeds, while for the QS filaments,
the ideal MHD mechanism can more likely generate a faster CME; (4) Comparing
with previous statistic study, the onset heights of filament eruptions and the
decay indexes of the overlying field show some differences: for AR filaments
and IFs, the decay indexes are larger and much closer to the theoretical
threshold, while for QS filaments, the onset heights are higher than those

better society wellness is increasing. In this sense, ground transportation in
dense urban environments has been facing challenges for many years (e.g.,
congestion and resilience). One import outcome of the effort made toward the
creation of new concepts for enhancing urban transportation is the Urban Air
Mobility (UAM) concept. UAM aims at enhancing city transportation services
using manned and unmanned vehicles. However, these operations bring many
challenges to be faced, e.g., the interaction between the controller agent and
autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, trajectory planning is not a simple task due
to several factors. Firstly, the trajectories must consider a reduced minimum
separation as eVTOL vehicle are expected to operate in complex urban
environments. This leads the trajectory planning process to observe safety
primitives more restrictively once the airspace is expected to comport many
vehicles that follow small minimum separation standards. Thereupon, the main
goal of the Trajectory-Based UAM Operations Simulator (TUS) is to simulate the
Trajectory-Based UAM operations in urban environments considering the presence
of both manned and unmanned eVTOL vehicles. For this, a Discrete Event
Simulation (DES) approach is adopted, which considers an input (i.e., the eVTOL
vehicles, their origin and destination, and their respective trajectories) and
produces an output (which describes if the trajectories are safe and the
elapsed operation time). The main contribution of this simulation tool is to
provide a simulated environment for testing and measuring the effectiveness
(e.g., flight duration) of trajectories planned for eVTOL vehicles.

considers a non-linear shear-thinning generalized Newtonian fluid. For this
type of non-linearity, we present an efficient approach to compute a
regularized strain rate which is then used to define the node-wise viscosity.
Depending on the compute architecture, we could observe maximum speedups of 64%
and 122% compared to the on-the-fly integration. The largest considered example
involved solving a Stokes problem with 12288 compute cores on the state of the

applications such as speech segmentation and speech rate modification. The
existing methods detect the majority of VOPs within 40 ms deviation, and it may
not be appropriate for the above speech applications. To address this issue, we
proposed a two-stage approach for accurate detection of VOPs. At the first
stage, VOPs are detected using continuous wavelet transform coefficients, and
the position of the detected VOPs are corrected using the phone boundaries in
the second stage. The phone boundaries are detected by the spectral transition

Performance of the proposed approach is compared with two standard signal

each recording time becomes a common feature for high-frequency data in
financial market. Using random matrix theory, this paper considers the
estimation of integrated covariance (ICV) matrices of high-dimensional
diffusion processes based on multiple high-frequency observations. We start by
studying the estimator, the time-variation adjusted realized covariance (TVA)
matrix, proposed in Zheng and Li (2011) without microstructure noise. We show
that in the high-dimensional case, for a class C of diffusion processes, the
limiting spectral distribution (LSD) of averaged TVA depends not only on that
of ICV, but also on the numbers of multiple transactions at each recording
time. However, in practice, the observed prices are always contaminated by the
market microstructure noise. Thus the limiting behavior of pre-averaging
averaged TVA matrices is studied based on the noisy multiple observations. We
show that for processes in class C, the pre-averaging averaged TVA has
desirable properties that it eliminates the effects of microstructure noise and
multiple transactions, and its LSD depends solely on that of the ICV matrix.
Further, three types of nonlinear shrinkage estimators of ICV are proposed
based on high-frequency noisy multiple observations. Simulation studies support
our theoretical results and show the finite sample performance of the proposed
estimators. At last, the high-frequency portfolio strategies are evaluated
under these estimators in real data analysis.

jointly extracting entities and relations over the pipelined extraction manner.
However, most existing joint models fail to balance the modeling of entity

first introduce the hierarchical dependency and horizontal commonality between
the two levels, and then propose an entity-enhanced dual tagging framework that
enables the triple extraction (TE) task to utilize such interactions with
self-learned entity features through an auxiliary entity extraction (EE) task,
without breaking the joint decoding of relational triples. Specifically, we
align the EE and TE tasks in a position-wise manner by formulating them as two
sequence labeling problems with identical encoder-decoder structure. Moreover,
the two tasks are organized in a carefully designed parameter sharing setting
so that the learned entity features could be naturally shared via multi-task
learning. Empirical experiments on the NYT benchmark demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art

spectroscopic signatures of outflow in the low-excitation lines of alkali
metals. The archival high-resolution spectra reveal a short-lived episode of
magnetospheric accretion in the system observed via inverse P Cyg profiles at
the H$\alpha$ and CaII 8542 $\unicode{x212B}$ lines. The simultaneous presence
of accretion and outflow signatures at CaII 8542 $\unicode{x212B}$ is
suggestive of an accretion-driven origin of the RZ Psc wind. We argue that RZ
Psc experiences matter ejection via the magnetic propeller mechanism but
variable accretion episodes allow it to sometimes move in the magnetospheric
accretion regime. The presence of the weak accretion in the system is also
supported by the radiation of the hot accretion spot on the stellar surface
observed spectroscopically at the deep photometric minimum of the star. The
Galactic motion of RZ Psc calculated with new GAIA DR2 astrometric data
suggests possible membership in Cas-Tau OB association with an age of

Not least due to advancements in crypto technologies adoption in real world
applications, it is now possible to convert the internet of things (IoT) into
an economy of things (EoT), which basically refers to a heterogeneous digital
economy of everything (dEoE). Based on the realization of the deficiencies of
Web2.0 and the loss of confidence in a central intermediaries based economy, a
societal desire to overcome these deficiencies has emerged. In the beginning,
the crypto movement has been enthusiastic about the ability to encode all
necessities for a digital economy in algorithms and code. However, in the mean
time, insight has gained ground that on the one hand, designing the EoT is a
quite complex endeavor and the resulting system might fail to achieve the
targeted ideals, even when no intermediaries are present. We emphasize this
position by arguing that the EoT in fact corresponds to a complex system
operated in open contexts, for which a sophisticated design approach and a set

necessary for a valid and effective EoT align well with the ideals of the
democratized Web3.0 movement, and are no naive rapture, but rather - adequate
adoption provided - can lead to socioeconomic efficiency. Over and above, we
postulate that in this kind of EoT, commercial companies not only play a role,

could state that it is rational for the society and enterprises to undertake

runtime if the mutation rate is reduced to $\Theta(1/n^2)$ and the population
size is sufficiently large. Furthermore, the EA with mutation rate
$\chi/n=\Theta(1/n)$ and modest population size $\lambda=\Omega(\ln n)$
optimises the scaled fitness function $e^{(\chi+\varepsilon)f(x)}$ for any
linear function $f$ and any $\varepsilon>0$ in expected time
$O(n\lambda\ln\lambda+n^2)$. These upper bounds also extend to some additively
decomposed fitness functions, such as the Royal Road functions. We expect that
the obtained results may be useful not only for the development of the theory
of evolutionary algorithms, but also for biological applications, such as the
directed evolution.

rotation and trajectories of the orbits are modified. Qualitatively, shear
thinning has a similar effect to elongating the particle in a Newtonian fluid.
The period of rotation increases as the particle slows down more when aligned

enhanced if classical behavior dominates around the local minimum such that the
inflaton probability distribution is drifted to the local minimum as a whole.
After the inflaton escapes from the local minimum due to the stochastic
dynamics, the ordinary slow-roll inflation follows and it can generate the
primordial density perturbation consistent with observation. Interestingly, our
scenario inherits the advantages of the old and new inflation: the typical
$e$-folds can be extremely large as in the old inflation, and slow-roll
inflation naturally follows after the stochastic regime as in the new
inflation. In our numerical example, the typical number of $e$-folds can be as
large as $10^{10^{10}}$, which is large enough for various light scalars such

research is not reproducible. One probable reason for low reproducibility is
insufficient sample size, resulting in low power and low positive predictive
value. It has been suggested that insufficient sample-size choice is driven by
a combination of scientific competition and 'positive publication bias'. Here
we formalize this intuition in a simple model, in which scientists choose
economically rational sample sizes, balancing the cost of experimentation with
income from publication. Specifically, assuming that a scientist's income
derives only from 'positive' findings (positive publication bias) and that
individual samples cost a fixed amount, allows to leverage basic statistical
formulas into an economic optimality prediction. We find that if effects have
i) low base probability, ii) small effect size or iii) low grant income per
publication, then the rational (economically optimal) sample size is small.
Furthermore, for plausible distributions of these parameters we find a robust
emergence of a bimodal distribution of obtained statistical power and low
overall reproducibility rates, both matching empirical findings. Finally, we
explore conditional equivalence testing as a means to align economic incentives
with adequate sample sizes. Overall, the model describes a simple mechanism
explaining both the prevalence and the persistence of small sample sizes, and
is well suited for empirical validation. It proposes economic rationality, or
economic pressures, as a principal driver of irreproducibility and suggests
strategies to change this.

variations in their mid-infrared SED; as the flux short-ward of a fulcrum
wavelength ($\lambda_{f}$) increases the flux long-wards of this wavelength
decreases (and vice-versa) over timescales of weeks to years. While previous
studies have shown that an opaque, axisymmetric occulter of variable height can
cause this behaviour in the SED of these objects, the conditions under which a
single $\lambda_{f}$ occurs have not previously been determined, nor the
factors determining its value. Using radiative transfer modelling, we conduct a
parametric study of the exemplar of this class, LRLL 31 to explore this
phenomenon, and confirm that the cause of this flux variation is likely due to
the change in height of the optically thick inner rim of the accretion disc at
the dust sublimation radius, or some other phenomenon which results in a
similar appearance. We also determine that a fulcrum wavelength only occurs for
high inclinations, where the line of sight intersects the accretion disc.
Accepting that the disc of LRLL 31 is highly inclined, the inner rim radius,
radial and vertical density profiles are independently varied to gauge what
effect this had on $\lambda_{f}$ and its position relative to the silicate
feature near $10 \mu$m. While $\lambda_{f}$ is a function of each of these
parameters, it is found to be most strongly dependent on the vertical density
exponent $\beta$. All other factors being held constant, only for flatter discs

relative poses from image pairs by minimizing photometric loss between warped

and photometric loss is incapable of discriminating distortion artifacts of
warped images, the estimated depth is vague and pose is inaccurate. In contrast
to previous methods, our framework learns a compact representation of
frame-to-frame correlation, which is updated by incorporating sequential

we tackle VO as a self-supervised image generation task and take advantage of
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The generator learns to estimate depth

at frequencies relevant for cosmic microwave background (CMB) studies
originates from nearby or more distant regions of our Galaxy. This questions
previous attempts that have been made to constrain magnetic field models at
local and large scales. The scope of this work is to investigate and quantify
the contribution of the dusty and magnetized local interstellar medium to the
observed emission that is polarized by thermal dust. We used stars as distance
candles and probed the line-of-sight submillimeter polarization properties by
comparing the emission that is polarized by thermal dust at submillimeter
wavelengths and the optical polarization caused by starlight. We provide
statistically robust evidence that at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| \geq
60^\circ$), the $353$ GHz polarized sky as observed by \textit{Planck} is
dominated by a close-by magnetized structure that extends between $200$ and
$300$ pc and coincides with the shell of the Local Bubble. Our result will
assist modeling the magnetic field of the Local Bubble and characterizing the
CMB Galactic foregrounds.

memory management functionality in an OS for modern computers like phones or
server-based accelerators. Existing software assumptions do not account for
heterogeneous cores with different views of the address space, leading to the
related problems of numerous security bugs in memory management code (for
example programming IOMMUs), and an inability of mainstream OSes to securely
manage the complete set of hardware resources on, say, a phone System-on-Chip.
  Our new work is based on a recent formal model of address translation
hardware which views the machine as a configurable network of address spaces.
We refine this to capture existing address translation hardware from modern
SoCs and accelerators at a sufficiently fine granularity to model minimal
rights both to access memory and configure translation hardware. We then build
an executable specification in Haskell, which expresses the model and metadata
structures in terms of partitioned capabilities. Finally, we show a fully
functional implementation of the model in C created by extending the capability
system of the Barrelfish research OS.
  Our evaluation shows that our unoptimized implementation has comparable (and
in some cases) better performance than the Linux virtual memory system, despite
both capturing all the functionality of modern hardware addressing and enabling
least-privilege, decentralized authority to access physical memory and devices.

protoplanetary disc, which determines growth and migration. In the pebble
accretion scenario, planets grow to the pebble isolation mass, at which the
planet carves a small gap in the gas disc halting the pebble flux and thus its
growth. The pebble isolation mass scales with the disc's aspect ratio, which
directly depends on the disc structure. I compare the growth of super-Earths in
viscously heated discs and discs purely heated by the central star with
super-Earth observations. This allows two formation pathways of super-Earths to
be distinguished in the inner systems. Planets growing within 1 Myr in the
viscously heated inner disc reach pebble isolation masses that correspond
directly to the inferred masses of the Kepler observations for systems that
feature planets in resonance or not in resonance. However, to explain the
period ratio distribution of Kepler planets -- where most Kepler planet pairs
are not in mean motion resonance configurations -- a fraction of these resonant
chains has to be broken. In case the planets are born early in a viscously
heated disc, these resonant chains thus have to be broken without planetary
mergers. If super-Earths form either late or in purely passive discs, the
pebble isolation mass is too small to explain the Kepler observations, implying
that planetary mergers are important for the final system architecture.
Resonant planetary systems thus have to experience mergers already during the
gas disc phase, so the planets can get trapped in resonance after reaching 5-10
Earth masses. In case instabilities are dominating the system architecture, the
systems should not be flat with mutually inclined orbits. This implies that
future observations of planetary systems with RV and transits could distinguish
between these two formation channels of super-Earth. (abridged)

method it was originally designed to be. It has indeed proven pivotal to help
increase the speed of many machine learning and data analysis techniques such
as indexing, nearest-neighbor search and prediction, data compression; its
beneficial use has been shown to carry over to the acceleration of kernel
machines (when using the Nystr\""om method). Here, we propose a fast extension
of K-means, dubbed QuicK-means, that rests on the idea of expressing the matrix
of the $K$ centroids as a product of sparse matrices, a feat made possible by
recent results devoted to find approximations of matrices as a product of
sparse factors. Using such a decomposition squashes the complexity of the
matrix-vector product between the factorized $K \times D$ centroid matrix
$\mathbf{U}$ and any vector from $\mathcal{O}(K D)$ to $\mathcal{O}(A \log
A+B)$, with $A=\min (K, D)$ and $B=\max (K, D)$, where $D$ is the dimension of
the training data. This drastic computational saving has a direct impact in the
assignment process of a point to a cluster, meaning that it is not only
tangible at prediction time, but also at training time, provided the
factorization procedure is performed during Lloyd's algorithm. We precisely
show that resorting to a factorization step at each iteration does not impair
the convergence of the optimization scheme and that, depending on the context,
it may entail a reduction of the training time. Finally, we provide discussions

computationally-efficient QuicK-means algorithm.

graph-theoretic approach to design and develop large scale scientific influence
analysis over a large research-grant repository with three original
contributions. First, we mine the grant database to identify and extract
important features for grants influence analysis and represent such features
using graph theoretic models. For example, we extract an institution graph and
multiple associated aspect-based collaboration graphs, including a discipline
graph and a keyword graph. Second, we introduce self-influence and co-influence
algorithms to compute two types of collaboration relationship scores based on
the number of grants and the types of grants for institutions. We compute the
self-influence scores to reflect the grant based research collaborations among
institutions and compute multiple co-influence scores to model the various
types of cross-institution collaboration relationships in terms of disciplines
and subject areas. Third, we compute the overall scientific influence score for
every pair of institutions by introducing a weighted sum of the self-influence
score and the multiple co-influence scores and conduct an influence-based

serve each group, whereas the users in the corresponding group are served based
on power-domain NOMA technique. Furthermore, simultaneous wireless power and
information transfer technique is utilized to simultaneously harvest energy and
decode information at each user. Therefore, each user splits the received
signal into two parts, namely, energy harvesting part and information decoding
part. In particular, we jointly determine the power allocation and power
splitting ratios for all users to minimize the transmit power under minimum
rate and minimum energy harvesting requirements at each user. Furthermore, this
joint design is a non-convex problem in nature. Hence, we employ successive
interference cancellation to overcome these non-convexity issues and determine
the design parameters (i.e., the power allocations and the power splitting
ratios). In simulation results, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed

some features and asymmetries might be too complex or subtle to ascribe to

be the missing ingredient required to produce these features. The only proven
triple, NGC 246, is insufficient to investigate the shaping role of triple

binaries in nuclei with known visual companions. Here we report on the SALT HRS
discovery of a 4.81 d orbital period in the CSPN of Sp 3 which has a visual

with distance estimates to the nebula, the GAIA DR2 parallax of the central

association between the visual companion and the 4.81 d binary, making the
nucleus of Sp 3 a likely triple. We determine $T_\mathrm{eff}=68^{+12}_{-6}$

an apparent bipolar morphology, jets and an unexpected `extreme' oxygen
abundance discrepancy factor (adf) of 24.6$^{+4.1}_{-3.4}$. The adf is
inconsistent with the purported trend for longer orbital period post-CE PNe to
exhibit normal adfs, further highlighting selection effects in post-CE PNe. The
Type-I nebular abundances of Sp 3, whose origin is often tied to more massive
progenitors, are incongruous with the likely Galactic Thick Disk membership of

exotic properties and novel quantum states that often defy textbook wisdom1-5.
Ferroelectric polarization and metallicity are well-known examples of mutually
exclusive properties that cannot coexist in bulk solids because the net
electric field in a metal can be fully screened by free electrons6. An
atomically thin metallic layer capped by insulating layers has shown decent
conductivity at room temperature7. Moreover, a penetrating polarization field
can be employed to induce an ion displacement and create an intrinsic
polarization in the metallic layer. Here we demonstrate that a ferroelectric
metal can be artificially synthesized through imposing a strong polarization
field in the form of ferroelectric/unit-cell-thin metal superlattices. In this
way the symmetry of an atomically thin conductive layer can be broken and
manipulated by a neighboring polar field, thereby forming a two-dimensional
(2D) ferroelectric metal. The fabricated of (SrRuO3)1/(BaTiO3)10 superlattices
exhibit ferroelectric polarization in an atomically thin layer with metallic
conductivity at room temperature. A multipronged investigation combining
structural analyses, electrical measurements, and first-principles electronic
structure calculations unravels the coexistence of 2D electrical conductivity
in the SrRuO3 monolayer accompanied by the electric polarization. Such 2D
ferroelectric metal paves a novel way to engineer a quantum multi-state with
unusual coexisting properties, such as ferroelectrics, ferromagnetics and
metals, manipulated by external fields8,9.

This learning task is difficult even if all training and test samples are drawn
from the same distribution---especially if the dimension of the uncertainty is
large relative to the training sample size. Wasserstein distributionally robust
optimization seeks data-driven decisions that perform well under the most
adverse distribution within a certain Wasserstein distance from a nominal

argue that this approach has many conceptual and computational benefits. Most
prominently, the optimal decisions can often be computed by solving tractable
convex optimization problems, and they enjoy rigorous out-of-sample and

detailed understanding and predictive modeling of chemical systems. In recent
years, several new types of force fields, which are based on machine learning
algorithms and fitted to ab initio reference calculations, have been introduced
to meet this requirement. Here we show how high-dimensional neural network
potentials can be employed to automatically generate the potential energy
surface of finite sized clusters at coupled cluster accuracy, namely
CCSD(T*)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ. The developed automated procedure utilizes the
established intrinsic properties of the model such that the configurations for
the training set are selected in an unbiased and efficient way to minimize the
computational effort of expensive reference calculations. These ideas are
applied to protonated water clusters from the hydronium cation, H$_3$O$^+$, up
to the tetramer, H$_9$O$_{4}^{+}$, and lead to a single potential energy
surface that describes all these systems at essentially converged coupled
cluster accuracy with a fitting error of 0.06 kJ/mol per atom. The fit is
validated in detail for all clusters up to the tetramer and yields reliable
results not only for stationary points, but also for reaction pathways,
intermediate configurations, as well as different sampling techniques. Per
design the NNPs constructed in this fashion can handle very different
conditions including the quantum nature of the nuclei and enhanced sampling
techniques covering very low as well as high temperatures. This enables fast
and exhaustive exploration of the targeted protonated water clusters with
essentially converged interactions. In addition, the automated process will
allow one to tackle finite systems much beyond the present case.

resources is need of the hour which has led to the upsurge of backscatter
communication (BSC) technology. However, this inherent potential of BSC is
challenged by hardware constraints of the underlying tags. We address this
timely concern by investigating the practical efficacy of
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology in overcoming the fundamental
limitations of BSC. Specifically, we first introduce a novel least-squares
based channel estimation (CE) protocol for multi-tag BSC settings that takes
care of both the unintended ambient reflections and the inability of tags in
performing estimation by themselves. Then using it, a nontrivial low-complexity
algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal transceiver designs for the
multiantenna reader to maximize the minimum value of the lower-bounded
backscattered throughput among the single-antenna semi-passive tags. Additional
analytical insights on both individually and jointly-optimal precoding vector
and detector matrix at the reader are provided by exploring the
asymptotically-optimal transceiver designs. Lastly detailed numerical
investigation is carried out to validate the theoretical results and quantify
the practically realizable throughput fairness. Specifically, more than
seven-fold increase in the common-backscattered-throughput among tags as
achieved by the proposed designs over the relevant benchmarks corroborates
their practical significance.

flares correlate with flare magnitudes as determined by the GOES soft X-ray
fluxes. A ""build-up and release"" scenario (BUR) for magnetic energy storage in
the solar corona suggests the existence of such a relationship, relating the
slowly varying subphotospheric energy sources to the sudden coronal energy
releases of flares and CMEs. Substantial amounts of research effort had not
previously found any obvious observational evidence for such a BUR process.
This has posed a puzzle since coronal magnetic energy storage represents the
consensus view of the basic flare mechanism. We have revisited the GOES soft
X-ray flare statistics for any evidence of correlations, using two isolated
active regions, and have found significant evidence for a ""saturation""
correlation. Rather than a ""reset"" form of this relaxation, in which the time
\textit{before} a flare correlates with its magnitude, the ""saturation""
relationship results in the time \textit{after} the flare showing the
correlation. The observed correlation competes with the effect of reduced GOES
sensitivity, in which weaker events can be under-reported systematically. This
complicates the observed correlation, and we discuss several approaches to
remedy this.

209458 b and perform a multi-band study in the near infrared with CARMENES.
  Methods: The H$_2$O absorption lines from the planet's atmosphere are
Doppler-shifted due to the large change in its radial velocity during transit.
This shift is of the order of tens of km s$^{-1}$, whilst the Earth's telluric
and the stellar lines can be considered quasi-static. We took advantage of this
to remove the telluric and stellar lines using SYSREM, a principal component
analysis algorithm. The residual spectra contain the signal from thousands of
planetary molecular lines well below the noise level. We retrieve this
information by cross-correlating the spectra with models of the atmospheric
absorption.
  Results: We find evidence of H$_2$O in HD 209458 b with a signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) of 6.4. The signal is blueshifted by --5.2 $^{+2.6}_{-1.3}$ km
s$^{-1}$, which, despite the error bars, is a firm indication of day-to-night
winds at the terminator of this hot Jupiter. Additionally, we performed a
multi-band study for the detection of H$_2$O individually from the three NIR
bands covered by CARMENES. We detect H$_2$O from its 1.0 $\mu$m band with a S/N
of 5.8, and also find hints from the 1.15 $\mu$m band, with a low S/N of 2.8.
No clear planetary signal is found from the 1.4 $\mu$m band.
  Conclusions: Our significant signal from the 1.0 $\mu$m band in HD 209458 b
represents the first detection of H$_2$O from this band, the bluest one to
date. The unfavorable observational conditions might be the reason for the
inconclusive detection from the stronger 1.15 and 1.4 $\mu$m bands. H$_2$O is
detected from the 1.0 $\mu$m band in HD 209458 b, but hardly in HD 189733 b,
which supports a stronger aerosol extinction in the latter.

less sensitive (at 95% confidence) to the ephemeral-region field than they are
to the active-region field. Frequency shifts between activity cycle minima and
maxima are controlled predominantly by the change of active region flux.
Frequency shifts at cycle minima (with respect to a magnetically quiet Sun) are
determined largely by the ephemeral flux, and are estimated to have been
$0.1\,\rm \mu Hz$ or less over the last few minima. We conclude that at epochs
of cycle minimum, frequency shifts due to near-surface magnetic activity are
negligible compared to the offsets between observed and model frequencies that
arise from inaccurate modelling of the near-surface layers (the so-called
surface term). The implication is that this will be the case for other Sun-like
stars with similar activity, which has implications for asteroseismic modelling
of stars.

method for the error of the atmospheric neutrino flux calculation from the
residual of the reconstruction of the atmospheric muon flux observed in a
precision experiment, by the study of atmospheric neutrino and muon fluxes
response to the variation of hadronic interaction. However, the efficiencty of
this method is largely dependent on the observation site of the atmospheric
muon flux, as the relation of the error of the atmospheric neutrino flux
calculation and the residual of the reconstruction of the atmospheric muon flux
is also largely dependent on the muon observation site, especially for the low
energy neutrinos. We calculate several observation sites, near Kamioka at sea
level, same but 2770m a.s.l.., Hanle India (4500m a.s.l.), and at Balloon
altitude ($\sim$ 32km). Then we estimate how stringently can the atmospheric
muon reduce the error in the calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux. We
also discuss on the source of error which is difficult to reduce by only the
observation of atmospheric muon.

the Weyl tensor, $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\beta$ and $\alpha$ are
dimensionless parameters. The critical condition in a dS or AdS background is
$\beta =6 \alpha$. This leads to critical gravity where the massive spin two
physical ghost becomes a massless spin two graviton. In contrast to the
original work on critical gravity, no Einstein gravity with a cosmological
constant is added explicitly to the higher-derivative action. The critical
condition is obtained in two independent ways. In the first case, we show the
equivalence between the initial action and an action containing Einstein
gravity, a cosmological constant, a massless scalar field plus Weyl squared
gravity. The scale invariance is spontaneously broken. The linearized
Einstein-Weyl equations about a dS or AdS background yield the critical
condition $\beta=6\alpha$. In the second case, we work directly with the
original quadratic action. After a suitable field redefinition, where the
metric perturbation is traceless and transverse, we obtain linearized equations
about a dS or AdS background that yield the critical condition $\beta=
6\alpha$. As in the first case, we also obtain a propagating massless scalar
field. Substituting $\beta=6\alpha$ into the energy and entropy formula for the
Schwarzschild and Kerr AdS or dS black hole in higher-derivative gravity yields
zero, the same value obtained in the original work on critical gravity. We
discuss the role of boundary conditions in relaxing the $\beta=6\alpha$

the domain area divided by the time duration. We obtain approximate analytical

function of the two-dimensional diffusion constant and the rate constant for
the attachment of adsorbates to the solid domain. In experiments, the area is
decreased by stopping the source gas flow. The rate of decrease of the area is
obtained from theory. The theoretical results presented provide a foundation to

conservation of $\zeta_s$ and $\zeta_u$, whereas the reverse does not hold. We
illustrate the consequence of these differences with two inflationary models:
ultra-slow-roll (USR) and braiding-ultra-slow-roll (BUSR). In USR, we show that
out of the three curvatures, only $\zeta_s$ is conserved outside the horizon,
and we connect this result to the concepts of separate universe and the usage
of the $\delta N$ formalism. We find that even though $\zeta_s$ is conserved,
there is still a mild violation of the separate universe approximation in the
continuity equation. Nevertheless, the $\delta N$ formalism can still be
applied to calculate the primordial power spectrum of some gauge-invariant
quantities such as $\zeta_u$, although it breaks down for others such as the
uniform-density curvature. In BUSR, we show that both $\zeta_u$ and $\zeta_s$
are conserved outside the horizon, but take different values. Additionally,
since $\zeta_u\not=\zeta_c$ we find that the prediction for observable
curvature fluctuations after inflation does not reflect $\zeta_c$ at horizon
crossing during inflation and moreover involves not just $\zeta_u$ at that
epoch but also the manner in which the braiding phase ends.

studies have often used meta-learning to simulate the few-shot task, thus
negating implicit common linguistic features across tasks. This paper addresses
such problems using meta-learning and unsupervised language models. Our
approach is based on the insight that having a good generalization from a few
examples relies on both a generic model initialization and an effective
strategy for adapting this model to newly arising tasks. We show that our
approach is not only simple but also produces a state-of-the-art performance on
a well-studied sentiment classification dataset. It can thus be further
suggested that pretraining could be a promising solution for few-shot learning
of many other NLP tasks. The code and the dataset to replicate the experiments

fingerprint of the infrared optical response in ZrSiS. We find that this
characteristic feature is robust with respect to uniaxial compressive strain of
up to 10 GPa, yet with the flat region being narrowed with increasing strain.
Upon uniaxial tensile stress of 2 GPa, the Fermi surface undergoes a Lifshitz
transition accompanied by a weakening of the interband screening, which reduces
the spectral weight of infrared excitations. We also show that the high-energy
region is characterized by low-loss plasma excitations at $\sim$20 eV with
essentially anisotropic dispersion. Strongly anisotropic dielectric properties
suggest the existence of a hyperbolic regime for plasmons in the deep
ultraviolet range. Although the frequencies of high-energy plasmons are
virtually unaffected by external uniaxial deformation, their dispersion can be
effectively tuned by strain.

Because of the absence of any significant photon identification by a leading

with the geomagnetic field and results in large electromagnetic cascade of
particles several thousands kilometers above the atmosphere. This collection of

deep learning techniques solely to learn the pricing map -- from model
parameters to prices or implied volatilities -- rather than directly the
calibrated model parameters as a function of observed market data. Having a
fast and accurate neural-network-based approximating pricing map (first step),
we can then (second step) use traditional model calibration algorithms. In this
work we showcase a direct comparison of different potential approaches to the
learning stage and present algorithms that provide a suffcient accuracy for
practical use. We provide a first neural network-based calibration method for
rough volatility models for which calibration can be done on the y. We
demonstrate the method via a hands-on calibration engine on the rough Bergomi
model, for which classical calibration techniques are diffcult to apply due to
the high cost of all known numerical pricing methods. Furthermore, we display
and compare different types of sampling and training methods and elaborate on
their advantages under different objectives. As a further application we use
the fast pricing method for a Bayesian analysis of the calibrated model.

they can help to overcome certain limitations of standard cameras under
complicated illumination conditions. However, due to the difference in the
information source of the two types of cameras, their images usually share very
low texture similarity. Hence, traditional texture-based feature matching
methods cannot be directly applied to obtain stereo correspondences. To tackle
this problem, a multi-spectral visual odometry method without explicit stereo
matching is proposed in this paper. Bundle adjustment of multi-view stereo is
performed on the visible and the thermal images using direct image alignment.
Scale drift can be avoided by additional temporal observations of map points
with the fixed-baseline stereo. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
method can provide accurate visual odometry results with recovered metric

an elastic part in which the stress increases linearly with strain, up to a
yield point at which the solid either fractures or starts deforming
plastically. It is well established, however, that the apparent linearity of
stress with strain is actually a proxy for a much more complex behavior, with a
microscopic plasticity that is reflected in diverging nonlinear elastic
coefficients. Very generally, the complex structure of the energy landscape is
expected to induce a singular response to small perturbations. In the athermal
quasistatic regime, this response manifests itself in the form of a scale free
plastic activity. The distribution of the corresponding avalanches should
reflect, according to theoretical mean field calculations (Franz and Spigler,
Phys. Rev. E., 2017, 95, 022139), the geometry of phase space in the vicinity
of a typical local minimum. In this work, we characterize this distribution for
simple models of glass forming systems, and we find that its scaling is
compatible with the mean field predictions for systems above the jamming
transition. These systems exhibit marginal stability, and scaling relations
that hold in the stationary state are examined and confirmed in the elastic
regime. By studying the respective influence of system size and age, we suggest
that marginal stability is systematic in the thermodynamic limit.

composite semi-analytical model to predict the properties of the expected EM
counterpart from BHNS mergers, focusing on the kilonova emission and on the
gamma-ray burst afterglow. Four main parameters rule the properties of the EM
emission: the NS mass $M_\mathrm{NS}$, its tidal deformability
$\Lambda_\mathrm{NS}$, the BH mass and spin. Only for certain combinations of
these parameters an EM counterpart is produced. Here we explore the parameter
space, and construct light curves, analysing the dependence of the EM emission
on the NS mass and tidal deformability. Exploring the NS parameter space
limiting to $M_\mathrm{NS}-\Lambda_\mathrm{NS}$ pairs described by a physically
motivated equations of state (EoS), we find that the brightest EM counterparts
are produced in binaries with low mass NSs (fixing the BH properties and the
EoS). Using constraints on the NS EoS from GW170817, our modeling shows that
the emission falls in a narrow range of absolute magnitudes. Within the range

preferences. All preferences are described by choice functions that satisfy
natural conditions. Under a no-externality assumption individual preferences
can be aggregated into a single choice function expressing a collective
preference. In this framework, a two-sided matching problem may be described as
an agreement problem between two parties: the two parties must find a stable
agreement, i.e., a set of contracts from which no party will want to take away
any contract and to which the two parties cannot agree to add any contract. On
such stable agreements each party's preference relation is a partial order and
the two parties have inverse preferences. An algorithm is presented that
generalizes algorithms previously proposed in less general situations. This
algorithm provides a stable agreement that is preferred to all stable
agreements by one of the parties and therefore less preferred than all stable
agreements by the other party. The number of steps of the algorithm is linear
in the size of the set of contracts, i.e., polynomial in the size of the
problem. The algorithm provides a proof that stable agreements form a lattice
under the two inverse preference relations. Under additional assumptions on the
role of money in preferences, agreement problems can describe general two-sided
markets in which goods are exchanged for money. Stable agreements provide a
solution concept, including prices, that is more general than competitive
equilibria. They satisfy an almost one price law for identical items.

Given a dxd matrix M, solutions to these problems are intimately related to the

i.e., that makes UM a matrix of maximal trace over rotations, and it is well
known this can be achieved with a method based on the computation of the

characterize dxd matrices of maximal trace over rotation matrices in terms of
their eigenvalues, and for d = 2, 3, we show how this characterization can be
used to determine whether a matrix is of maximal trace over rotation matrices.
Finally, although depending only slightly on the characterization, as a
secondary goal of the paper, for d = 2, 3, we identify alternative ways, other
than the SVD, of obtaining solutions to the aforementioned problems.

communicate with humans using natural language. Modeling conversation is an
important task in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.
While chatbots can be used for various tasks, in general they have to
understand users' utterances and provide responses that are relevant to the
problem at hand.
  In my work, I conduct an in-depth survey of recent literature, examining over
70 publications related to chatbots published in the last 3 years. Then, I
proceed to make the argument that the very nature of the general conversation
domain demands approaches that are different from current state-of-of-the-art
architectures. Based on several examples from the literature I show why current
chatbot models fail to take into account enough priors when generating
responses and how this affects the quality of the conversation. In the case of
chatbots, these priors can be outside sources of information that the
conversation is conditioned on like the persona or mood of the conversers. In
addition to presenting the reasons behind this problem, I propose several ideas
on how it could be remedied.
  The next section focuses on adapting the very recent Transformer model to the
chatbot domain, which is currently state-of-the-art in neural machine
translation. I first present experiments with the vanilla model, using
conversations extracted from the Cornell Movie-Dialog Corpus. Secondly, I
augment the model with some of my ideas regarding the issues of encoder-decoder
architectures. More specifically, I feed additional features into the model
like mood or persona together with the raw conversation data. Finally, I
conduct a detailed analysis of how the vanilla model performs on conversational
data by comparing it to previous chatbot models and how the additional features
affect the quality of the generated responses.

learn non-linear mapping between the interpolated image and ground truth
high-resolution (HR) image. However, interpolation processing can lead to
visual artifacts as details are over-smoothed, particularly when the
super-resolution factor is high. In this paper, we propose a Deep Recurrent
Fusion Network (DRFN), which utilizes transposed convolution instead of bicubic
interpolation for upsampling and integrates different-level features extracted
from recurrent residual blocks to reconstruct the final HR images. We adopt a
deep recurrence learning strategy and thus have a larger receptive field, which
is conducive to reconstructing an image more accurately. Furthermore, we show
that the multi-level fusion structure is suitable for dealing with image

The NH$_3$ (1,1) through (6,6) lines in NGC 4945 display a superposition of

strengths in NGC 4945 show similar anomalies as in previous studies of Arp 220

supervised manner is more effective than using conventional handcrafted
features for automatic detection of knee joints and fine-grained knee OA image
classification. In the general machine learning approach to automatically
assess knee OA severity, the first step is to localize the region of interest
that is to detect and extract the knee joint regions from the radiographs, and
the next step is to classify the localized knee joints based on a radiographic
classification scheme such as Kellgren and Lawrence grades. First, the existing
approaches for detecting (or localizing) the knee joint regions based on
handcrafted features are reviewed and outlined. Next, three new approaches are
introduced: 1) to automatically detect the knee joint region using a fully
convolutional network, 2) to automatically assess the radiographic knee OA
using CNNs trained from scratch for classification and regression of knee joint
images to predict KL grades in ordinal and continuous scales, and 3) to
quantify the knee OA severity optimizing a weighted ratio of two loss
functions: categorical cross entropy and mean-squared error using
multi-objective convolutional learning and ordinal regression. Two public
datasets: the OAI and the MOST are used to evaluate the approaches with
promising results that outperform existing approaches. In summary, this work
primarily contributes to the field of automated methods for localization

in this field is to get infrared colloidal nanocrystals. Mercury selenide
(HgSe) and mercury telluride (HgTe) are potential candidates. The goal of this
PhD work is to strengthen our knowledge on optical, optoelectronic and
transport properties of these nanocrystals, in order to design an infrared
detector. To do so, we studied the electronic structure of HgSe and HgTe for
different sizes and surface chemistries. We can then determine the energies of
the electronic levels and the Fermi energy, quantify doping level. We show that
the nanocrystal size has an influence on doping level, which gets more and more
n-type as the nanocrystal size gets larger. We even observe a
semiconductor-metal transition in HgSe nanocrystals as the size is increased.
The doping control with surface chemistry is then investigated. By using
dipolar effects or oxidizing ligands, we show a doping control over several
orders of magnitude. Thanks to these studies, we are able to propose a HgTe
based device for detection at 2,5 um, which structure allows to convert
effectively the absorbed photons into an electrical current and to get a high
signal over noise ratio. We get a photoresponse of 20 mA/W and a detectivity of

with ideal properties like full connectivity, noise-freedom and arbitrarily
long coherence time. In Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices,
however, the number of qubits is highly limited and quantum operation error and
qubit coherence are not negligible. Besides, the connectivity of physical
qubits in a quantum processing unit (QPU) is also strictly constrained.
Thereby, additional operations like SWAP gates have to be inserted to satisfy
this constraint while preserving the functionality of the original circuit.
This process is known as quantum circuit transformation. Adding additional
gates will increase both the size and depth of a quantum circuit and therefore
cause further decay of the performance of a quantum circuit. Thus it is crucial
to minimize the number of added gates. In this paper, we propose an efficient
method to solve this problem. We first choose by using simulated annealing an
initial mapping which fits well with the input circuit and then, with the help
of a heuristic cost function, stepwise apply the best selected SWAP gates until
all quantum gates in the circuit can be executed. Our algorithm runs in time
polynomial in all parameters including the size and the qubit number of the
input circuit, and the qubit number in the QPU. Its space complexity is
quadratic to the number of edges in the QPU. Experimental results on extensive
realistic circuits confirm that the proposed method is efficient and can reduce
by 57% on average the size of the output circuits when compared with the
state-of-the-art algorithm on the most recent IBM quantum device viz. IBM Q20

different quantum wells, and the width of the spectra increases with decreasing
peak emission energy. The corresponding I-V characteristics are described well

approach is the possibility to correlate the EL intensity of a single NW LED

localization and Bayesian additive modeling, our model is built around a
recursive partitioning (RP) scheme. Within each RP partition, a sparse GP (SGP)
regression model is fitted. A Bayesian additive framework then combines
multiple layers of partitioned SGPs, capturing both global trends and local
refinements with efficient computations. The model addresses both the problem
of efficiency in fitting a full Gaussian process regression model and the
problem of prediction performance associated with a single SGP. Our approach
mitigates the issue of pseudo-input selection and avoids the need for complex
inter-block correlations in existing methods. The crucial trade-off becomes
choosing between many simpler local model components or fewer complex global
model components, which the practitioner can sensibly tune. Implementation is
via a Metropolis-Hasting Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm with Bayesian
back-fitting. We compare our model against popular alternatives on simulated
and real datasets, and find the performance is competitive, while the fully
Bayesian procedure enables the quantification of model uncertainties.

potentially caused by embedded planets. We investigate how the gas surface
density in discs changes the observed morphology in scattered light and dust
continuum emission. Assuming that disc substructures are due to embedded
protoplanets, we combine hydrodynamical modelling with radiative transfer
simulations of dusty protoplanetary discs hosting planets. The response of
different dust species to the gravitational perturbation induced by a planet
depends on the drag stopping time - a function of the generally unknown local
gas density. Small dust grains, being stuck to the gas, show spirals. Larger
grains decouple, showing progressively more axisymmetric (ring-like)
substructure as decoupling increases with grain size or with the inverse of the
gas disc mass. We show that simultaneous modelling of scattered light and dust
continuum emission is able to constrain the Stokes number, ${\rm St}$. Hence,
if the dust properties are known, this constrains the local gas surface
density, $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$, at the location of the structure, and hence the
total gas mass. In particular, we found that observing ring-like structures in
mm-emitting grains requires ${\rm St} \gtrsim 0.4$ and therefore $\Sigma_{\rm
gas} \lesssim 0.4\,\textrm{g/cm}^{2}$. We apply this idea to observed
protoplanetary discs showing substructures both in scattered light and in the
dust continuum.

improving the energy and spectral efficiencies of cellular networks. To improve
the achievable performance of such networks, underlay device-to-device (D2D)
multicast communication offers a practical solution. However, despite
significant potential for providing higher throughput and lower delay,
implementing underlay D2D multicast communication poses several challenges,
such as mutual interference among cellular users (CUs) and D2D multicast groups
(MGs), and overhead signaling to provide channel state information, that may
limit potential gains. We study a scenario where multiple D2D multicast groups
may share a CU's uplink channel. We formulate an optimization problem to
maximize the achievable system throughput while fulfilling quality of service
(QoS) requirements of every CU and D2D MGs, subject to their corresponding
maximum transmit power constraints. The formulated optimization problem is an
instance of mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is
computationally intractable, in general. Therefore, to find a feasible
solution, we propose a pragmatic two-step process of channel allocation and
power allocation. In the first-step, we propose a channel allocation algorithm,
which determines the subset of MGs that may share a channel subject to criteria
based on two different parameters: interference and outage probabilities. Then,
we propose an algorithm to allocate power to these MG subsets that maximizes
the system throughput, while satisfying transmit power constraint. Numerical
results show the efficacy of proposed approach in terms of higher achievable
sum throughput and better spectrum efficiency with respect to various existing
schemes.

additional boundary information (i.e., the behavior of the phenomena along

scientific knowledge. While there has been recent work on incorporating
boundary information within GPs, such models do not provide theoretical
insights on improved convergence rates. To this end, we propose a new GP model,
called BdryGP, for incorporating boundary information. We show that BdryGP not
only has improved convergence rates over existing GP models (which do not
incorporate boundaries), but is also more resistant to the
""curse-of-dimensionality"" in nonparametric regression. Our proofs make use of a
novel connection between GP interpolation and finite-element modeling.

segmentation of the thin tissue interfaces which characterise these diagnoses.
Even when a label set has a high spatial overlap with the ground truth,
inaccurate delineation of these interfaces can result in topological errors.
These compromise the clinical utility of such models due to the anomalous
appearance of defects. CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
segmentation tasks. Whilst data augmentation has often played an important
role, we show that conventional image resampling schemes used therein can
introduce topological changes in the ground truth labelling of augmented
samples. We present a novel pipeline to correct for these changes, using a
fast-marching algorithm to enforce the topology of the ground truth labels
within their augmented representations. In so doing, we invoke the idea of
cardiac contiguous topology to describe an arbitrary combination of congenital
heart defects and develop an associated, clinically meaningful metric to
measure the topological correctness of segmentations. In a series of five-fold
cross-validations, we demonstrate the performance gain produced by this
pipeline and the relevance of topological considerations to the segmentation of
congenital heart defects. We speculate as to the applicability of this approach
to any segmentation task involving morphologically complex targets.

the characterization of the session resource request probability mass function

user location and system parameters including modulation and coding schemes

five-point ordinal scale (0--4). In this study, we used Elastic Net (EN) and
Random Forests (RF) to build predictive models using patient assessment data
(i.e. signs and symptoms of both knees and medication use) and a convolution
neural network (CNN) trained using X-ray images only. Linear mixed effect
models (LMM) were used to model the within subject correlation between the two
knees. The root mean squared error for the CNN, EN, and RF models was 0.77,
0.97, and 0.94 respectively. The LMM shows similar overall prediction accuracy
as the EN regression but correctly accounted for the hierarchical structure of
the data resulting in more reliable inference. Useful explanatory variables
were identified that could be used for patient monitoring before X-ray imaging.
Our analyses suggest that the models trained for predicting the KOA severity
levels achieve comparable results when modeling X-ray images and patient data.
The subjectivity in the KL grade is still a primary concern.

topological number have attracted considerable attention because of their
naturally long surface Fermi arcs and bulk quantized circular photogalvanic
effect (CPGE). Multifold fermions only appear in metallic states, and
therefore, most studies so far have only focused on the semimetals in compounds
with chiral crystal structures. In this work, we show that the structurally
chiral topological trivial insulators are also exotic states, which is
interesting from the application point of view, owing to their natural
advantage to host a large bulk photovoltaic effect in the visible wavelength
region. In the last decades, the shift current in the visible wavelength region
was limited to be 10 uA/V2 . By scanning the insulators with chiral structure,
we found a class of compounds with photoconductivity ranging from 20 to 80
uA/V2 , which is approximately one order of magnitude larger than that reported
in other real materials. This work illustrates that the compounds with chiral
structure can host both quantum CPGE and a strong shift current in the second
order optical response. Moreover, this work offers a good platform for the
study of the shift current and its future application by putting the focus on
insulator with chiral lattices, so far overlooked in photovoltaic technologies.

$\phi_L:M_k \to M_k$, by the law $\rho \,\to\,\phi_L(\rho) = \int_{M_k} L(v)

  On a previous work the authors show that for a fixed measure $\mu$ it is
generic on the function $L$ the $\Phi$-Erg property (also irreducibility). Here
we will show that the purification property is also generic on $L$ for a fixed

  Given $L$ and $\mu$ there are two related stochastic process: one takes
values on the projective space $ P(\C^k)$ and the other on matrices in $M_k$.
The $\Phi$-Erg property and the purification condition are good hypothesis for
the discrete time evolution given by the natural transition probability. In
this way it will follow that generically on $L$, if $\int |L(v)|^2 \log

accurate predictions of its performance. This work serves to answer a simple

to be reduced by a factor of 500-2400, by the combined effects of, first, the
140 meters water equivalent overburden attenuating the cosmic muon flux by a
factor of 40, and second, scintillation veto detectors gating out most of the
remaining muon-induced effects. The new background data are compared to spectra
taken with the same detectors at the Earth's surface and at other underground

discusses two types of heterogeneity. The first one is the type of data, such
as metabolomics, proteomics and RNAseq data in genomics. These different omics
data reflect the properties of the studied biological system from different
perspectives. The second one is the type of scale, which indicates the
measurements obtained at different scales, such as binary, ordinal, interval
and ratio-scaled variables. In this thesis, we developed several statistical
methods capable to fuse data sets of these two types of heterogeneity. The
advantages of the proposed methods in comparison with other approaches are
assessed using comprehensive simulations as well as the analysis of real
biological data sets.

numerically in a domain with curved boundary or on a curved surface, mesh error
and geometric approximation error caused by the inaccurate location of vertices
and other interior grid points, respectively, could be the main source of the
inaccuracy and instability of the numerical solutions of PDEs. The role of
these geometric errors in deteriorating the stability and particularly the
conservation properties are largely unknown, which seems to necessitate very
fine meshes especially to remove geometric approximation error. This paper aims
to investigate the effect of geometric approximation error by using a
high-order mesh with negligible geometric approximation error, even for high
order polynomial of order p. To achieve this goal, the high-order mesh
generator from CAD geometry called NekMesh is adapted for surface mesh
generation in comparison to traditional meshes with non-negligible geometric
approximation error. Two types of numerical tests are considered. Firstly, the
accuracy of differential operators is compared for various p on a curved
element of the sphere. Secondly, by applying the method of moving frames, four
different time-dependent PDEs on the sphere are numerically solved to
investigate the impact of geometric approximation error on the accuracy and
conservation properties of high-order numerical schemes for PDEs on the sphere.

present business areas. However, SOA system is loosely coupled with multiple

easily be attacked by unauthorized access and information theft. The existed
access control mechanism can only prevent unauthorized users from accessing the
system, but they can not prevent those authorized users (insiders) from
attacking the system. To address this problem, we propose a behavior-aware
service access control mechanism using security policy monitoring for SOA
system. In our mechanism, a monitor program can supervise consumer's behaviors
in run time. By means of trustful behavior model (TBM), if finding the
consumer's behavior is of misusing, the monitor will deny its request. If
finding the consumer's behavior is of malicious, the monitor will early
terminate the consumer's access authorizations in this session or add the
consumer into the Blacklist, whereby the consumer will not access the system
from then on. In order to evaluate the feasibility of proposed mechanism, we
implement a prototype system. The final results illustrate that our mechanism
can effectively monitor consumer's behaviors and make effective responses when
malicious behaviors really occur in run time. Moreover, as increasing the
rule's number in TBM continuously, our mechanism can still work well.

usually results in difficult model interpretation when used in clinical. Even
though there are multiple interpretation methods available for the DL model,
there is no evidence of which method is suitable for PD recognition
application. This tutorial aims to demonstrate the procedure to choose a
suitable interpretation method for the PD recognition model. We exhibit four
DCNN architectures as an example and introduce six well-known interpretation
methods. Finally, we propose an evaluation method to measure the interpretation
performance and a method to use the interpreted feedback for assisting in model
selection. The evaluation demonstrates that the guided backpropagation and SHAP
interpretation methods are suitable for PD recognition methods in different
aspects. Guided backpropagation has the best ability to show fine-grained
importance, which is proven by the highest Dice coefficient and lowest mean
square error. On the other hand, SHAP can generate a better quality heatmap at
the uptake depletion location, which outperforms other methods in
discriminating the difference between PD and NC subjects. Shortly, the
introduced interpretation methods can contribute to not only the PD recognition
application but also to sensor data processing in an AI Era (interpretable-AI)
as feedback in constructing well-suited deep learning architectures for
specific applications.

enhanced defense technique denoted Attention and Adversarial Logit
Pairing(AT+ALP), which encourages both attention map and logit for the pairs of
examples to be similar. When being applied to clean examples and their
adversarial counterparts, AT+ALP improves accuracy on adversarial examples over
adversarial training. We show that AT+ALP can effectively increase the average
activations of adversarial examples in the key area and demonstrate that it
focuses on discriminate features to improve the robustness of the model.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using a wide range of datasets and
the experiment results show that our AT+ALP achieves the state of the art
defense performance. For example, on 17 Flower Category Database, under strong
200-iteration PGD gray-box and black-box attacks where prior art has 34% and
39% accuracy, our method achieves 50% and 51%. Compared with previous work, our
