adding either induction axioms or reflection axioms on top of them. Theories of
this kind can interpret some well-known predicatively reducible fragments of
second-order arithmetic such as iterated arithmetical comprehension.
  We obtain sharp results on the proof-theoretic strength of these systems

unary operators acting on the semilattice of axiomatizable extensions of our
basic theory of iterated truth. The substructure generated by the top element

  Using these notations we obtain conservativity relationships for iterated
reflection principles of different logical complexity levels corresponding to

instabilities in a gas of self-gravitating fermions within the framework of
general relativity. In the classical (nondegenerate) limit, the system
undergoes a gravitational collapse at low energies $E<E_c$ and low temperatures
$T<T_c$. This is called ""gravothermal catastrophe"" in the microcanonical
ensemble and ""isothermal collapse"" in the canonical ensemble. When quantum
mechanics is taken into account and when the particle number is below the
Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit ($N<N_{\rm OV}$), complete gravitational collapse is
prevented by the Pauli exclusion principle. In that case, the Fermi gas
undergoes a gravitational phase transition from a gaseous phase to a condensed
phase. The condensed phase represents a compact object like a white dwarf, a
neutron star, or a dark matter fermion ball. When $N>N_{\rm OV}$, there can be
a subsequent gravitational collapse below a lower critical energy $E<E''_c$ or
a lower critical temperature $T<T'_c$ leading presumably to the formation of a
black hole. The evolution of the system is different in the microcanonical and
canonical ensembles. In the microcanonical ensemble, the system takes a
""core-halo"" structure. The core consists in a compact quantum object or a black
hole while the hot halo is expelled at large distances. This is reminiscent of
the red giant structure of low-mass stars or the implosion-explosion of massive
stars (supernova). In the canonical ensemble, the system collapses as a whole
towards a compact object or a black hole. This is reminiscent of the implosion
of supermassive stars (hypernova).

direction sub-model that combines individual desired moving direction and
neighbor's influence to imitate the process of navigating in a two-dimensional
space, and an intrinsically collision-free speed sub-model which controls the
speed of the agents with respect to the distance to their neighbors.
  In this paper we generalize the collision-free velocity model by introducing
the influence of walls and extending the distance calculations to
velocity-based ellipses. Besides, we introduce enhancements to the direction
sub-module that smooth the direction changes of pedestrians in the simulation;
a shortcoming that was not visible in the original model due to the symmetry of
the circular shapes. Moreover, the introduced improvements mitigate backward
movements, leading to a more realistic distribution of pedestrians especially
in bottleneck scenarios.
  We study by simulation the effects of the pedestrian's shape by comparing the
fundamental diagram in narrow and wide corridors. Furthermore, we validate our
generalized approach by investigating the flow through bottlenecks with varying

This gives an analytic handle on the physics in some particular excited states.
In the limit of large random matrices we find the physics of a non-relativistic

We give an exact solution for the first two orders in the 't Hooft expansion of
the random matrix model and compare with expectations from effective field
theory, previous weak coupling results, and we analyze the non-perturbative
terms in the strong 't Hooft coupling limit. Finally, we apply the random

the angular two-point correlation function of the LoTSS radio sources. The
counts-in-cell statistic reveals that the distribution of radio sources cannot
be described by a spatial Poisson process. Instead, a good fit is provided by a
compound Poisson distribution. The differential source counts are in good
agreement with previous findings in deep fields at low radio frequencies and
with simulated catalogues from the SKA design study sky and the Tiered Radio
Extragalactic Continuum Simulation. The angular two-point correlation is
$<10^{-2}$ at angular scales $> 1$ deg. Restricting the value added source
catalogue to low-noise regions and a flux density threshold of 2 mJy provides
our most reliable estimate of the angular two-point correlation. For smaller
flux density thresholds systematic issues are identified, most likely related
to the flux density calibration of the individual pointings. Based on the
distribution of photometric redshifts of LoTSS sources and the Planck 2018
best-fit cosmological model, the theoretically predicted angular two-point
correlation between 0.1 deg and 6 deg agrees with the measured clustering for a

learning implementations can be added easily via common interfaces between the

matrices of up-type quark and charged lepton in Hermitian basis are found as
invariant with energy scale. Based on this result, we can decouple the RGEs and
obtain the RGE corrected mass matrices of fermion. As examples, we consider the
renormalization-group evolution of fermion matrices with four or five texture
zeros and of lepton mass matrices which realize the tribimaximal mixing.

statistical equilibrium in general relativity. In the classical limit, the
caloric curves of a self-gravitating gas depend on a unique parameter
$\nu=GNm/Rc^2$, called the compactness parameter, where $N$ is the particle
number and $R$ the system's size. Typically, the caloric curves have the form
of a double spiral. The ""cold spiral"", corresponding to weakly relativistic
configurations, is a generalization of the caloric curve of nonrelativistic
classical self-gravitating systems. The ""hot spiral'"", corresponding to
strongly relativistic configurations, is similar (but not identical) to the
caloric curve of the ultrarelativistic self-gravitating black-body radiation.
We introduce two types of normalization of energy and temperature in order to
obtain asymptotic caloric curves describing respectively the cold and the hot
spirals in the limit $\nu\rightarrow 0$. As the number of particles increases,
the cold and the hot spirals approach each other, merge at $\nu'_S=0.128$, form
a loop above $\nu_S=0.1415$, reduce to a point at $\nu_{\rm max}=0.1764$, and
finally disappear. Therefore, the double spiral shrinks when the compactness
parameter $\nu$ increases, implying that general relativistic effects render
the system more unstable. We discuss the nature of the gravitational collapse
at low and high energies with respect to a dynamical (fast) or a
thermodynamical (slow) instability.

However, Pb-doping has so far failed to achieve p-type Bi$_2$Se$_3$ not only in

real spatial dimension of a lattice with a ""synthetic'"" dimension in frequency
space greatly reduces the hardware complexity of an analog quantum simulator.
Complex control and read-out of a highly multi-moded structure can thus be
accomplished with very few physical control lines. We demonstrate this concept
with microwave photons in a superconducting transmission line resonator by
modulating the system parameters at frequencies near the resonator's free
spectral range and observing propagation of photon wavepackets in time domain.
The linear propagation dynamics are equivalent to a tight-binding model, which
we probe by measuring scattering parameters between frequency sites. We extract
an approximate tight-binding dispersion relation for the synthetic lattice and
initialize photon wavepackets with well-defined quasimomenta and group
velocities. As an example application of this platform in simulating a physical

periodic potential and subject to a constant external field. The simulated

Our rendering relies on a physical particle simulator, an estimation of the

arbitrary amount of realistic rain or fog. We validate our rendering with a
user study, proving our rain is judged 40% more realistic that
state-of-the-art. Using our generated weather augmented Kitti and Cityscapes
dataset, we conduct a thorough evaluation of deep object detection and semantic
segmentation algorithms and show that their performance decreases in degraded
weather, on the order of 15% for object detection and 60% for semantic
segmentation. Furthermore, we show refining existing networks with our
augmented images improves the robustness of both object detection and semantic

of 15% for object detection and 35% for semantic segmentation compared to
original rainy performance. Augmented databases and code are available on the

Methodology: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study identifying the goal and
the research questions, the bibliographic sources, the search strings, and the
selection criteria to retrieve the most relevant papers. Results: We identified
several agreed microservice architectural principles and patterns widely
adopted and reported in 23 case studies, together with a summary of the
advantages, disadvantages, and lessons learned for each pattern from the case

automatic voltage regulators have served as an effective means of meeting

increases in power electronically-coupled generation and load, the dynamics of
large-scale power systems are rapidly changing. Electric grids are losing
inertia and traditional sources of voltage support and oscillation damping. The
system load is becoming stiffer with respect to changes in voltage. In
parallel, advancements in wide-area measurement technology have made it
possible to implement control strategies that act on information transmitted
over long distances in nearly real time. In this paper, we present a power
system stabilizer architecture that can be viewed as a generalization of the
standard $\Delta\omega$-type stabilizer. The control strategy utilizes a
real-time estimate of the center-of-inertia speed derived from wide-area
measurements. This approach creates a flexible set of trade-offs between
transient and small-signal response, making synchronous generators better able
to adapt to changes in system dynamics. The phenomena of interest are examined
using a two-area test case and a reduced-order model of the North American
Western Interconnection. To validate the key findings under realistic

to combine high-fidelity power system and communication network models. The
benefits of the proposed control strategy are retained even under pessimistic

such viscoelasticity-mediated interactions have striking consequences on the
behavior of multi-AP systems strongly confined in a circular pore. In
particular, these systems exhibit a transition from liquid-like behavior to a
highly ordered state upon increasing their activity. A further increase in

with a large spectroscopic and astrometric survey of targets towards sigma
Orionis. Eventually, it will be one of the open clusters with the lowest
proportion of interlopers and the largest proportion of confirmed cluster
members with known uncontrovertible youth features. Methods. We acquired 317
low-resolution optical spectra with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph

Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) at the 10.4 m Gran

other key lines from these spectra, and determined spectral types. We
complemented this information with Gaia DR2 astrometric data and other features

metamodelling method to estimate the cumulative as well as complementary
cumulative distribution function (CDF/CCDF) for forward uncertainty

on developing AL-GP approaches for reliability (rare event probability)
analysis of expensive black-box solvers. A naive iteration of these algorithms
with respect to different CDF/CCDF threshold values would yield a discretized
CDF/CCDF. However, this approach inevitably leads to a trade-off between
accuracy and computational efficiency since both depend (in opposite way) on
the selected discretization. In this study, a specialized error measure and a
learning function are developed such that the resulting AL-GP method is able to
efficiently estimate the CDF/CCDF for a specified range of interest without an
explicit dependency on discretization. Particularly, the proposed AL-GP method
is able to simultaneously provide accurate CDF and CCDF estimation in their

practical re-id applications. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we
consider person re-identification without inter-camera identity association but
only with identity labels independently annotated within each individual
camera-view. This eliminates the most time-consuming and tedious inter-camera
identity labelling process in order to significantly reduce the amount of human
efforts required during annotation. It hence gives rise to a more scalable and
more feasible learning scenario, which we call Intra-Camera Supervised (ICS)
person re-id. Under this ICS setting with weaker label supervision, we
formulate a Multi-Task Multi-Label (MTML) deep learning method. Given no
inter-camera association, MTML is specially designed for self-discovering the
inter-camera identity correspondence. This is achieved by inter-camera
multi-label learning under a joint multi-task inference framework. In addition,
MTML can also efficiently learn the discriminative re-id feature
representations by fully using the available identity labels within each
camera-view. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance superiority of
our MTML model over the state-of-the-art alternative methods on three
large-scale person re-id datasets in the proposed intra-camera supervised
learning setting.

this end, we propose a spatially-aware network (SpaNet) to capture spatial
information in a multi-scale manner. A dual-head variation of the SpaNet is
first utilized to predict the pixel-wise segmentation and centroid detection
maps of nuclei. Based on these outputs, a single-head SpaNet predicts the
positional information related to each nucleus instance. Spectral clustering
method is applied on the output of the last SpaNet, which utilizes the nuclear
mask and the Gaussian-like detection map for determining the connected

clustering method is the final nuclear instance segmentation mask. We applied
our method on a publicly available multi-organ data set and achieved

multi-resolution aggregation for inference, the proposed approach is able to
solve the scale variation challenge in bottom-up multi-person pose estimation
and localize keypoints more precisely, especially for small person. The feature
pyramid in HigherHRNet consists of feature map outputs from HRNet and upsampled
higher-resolution outputs through a transposed convolution. HigherHRNet
outperforms the previous best bottom-up method by 2.5% AP for medium person on
COCO test-dev, showing its effectiveness in handling scale variation.
Furthermore, HigherHRNet achieves new state-of-the-art result on COCO test-dev
(70.5% AP) without using refinement or other post-processing techniques,
surpassing all existing bottom-up methods. HigherHRNet even surpasses all
top-down methods on CrowdPose test (67.6% AP), suggesting its robustness in

stability analysis of plasmas heated by streaming CRs. We separately treat

We include both CR streaming and diffusion along the magnetic-field direction.
Thermal stability depends strongly on the ratio of CR pressure to gas pressure,
which determines whether modes are isobaric or isochoric. Modes with $\mathbf{k
\cdot B }\neq 0$ are strongly affected by CR diffusion. When the streaming time
is shorter than the CR diffusion time, thermally unstable modes (with
$\mathbf{k \cdot B }\neq 0$) are waves propagating at a speed $\propto$ the
Alfv\'en speed. Halo gas in photoionization equilibrium is thermally stable
independent of CR pressure, while gas in collisional ionization equilibrium is
unstable for physically realistic parameters. In gravitationally stratified
plasmas, the oscillation frequency of thermally overstable modes can be higher
in the presence of CR streaming than the buoyancy/free-fall frequency. This may
modify the critical $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ at which multiphase gas is
present. The criterion for convective instability of a stratified, CR-heated

matter-dominated era (EMDE), the Universe was dominated by massive particles,
or an oscillating scalar field, that decayed into Standard Model particles,
thus reheating the Universe. This decay process could also be the primary
source of dark matter. In the absence of fine-tuning between the masses of the
parent and daughter particles, both dark matter particles and Standard Model
particles would be produced with relativistic velocities. We investigate the
effects of the nonthermal production of dark matter particles with relativistic
velocities on the matter power spectrum by determining the resulting velocity
distribution function for the dark matter. We find that the vast majority of
dark matter particles produced during the EMDE are still relativistic at
reheating, so their free streaming erases the perturbations that grow during
the EMDE. The free streaming of the dark matter particles can also prevent the
formation of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way and the structures
observed in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. For a given reheat temperature, these
observations put an upper limit on the velocity of the dark matter particles at
their creation. For example, for a reheat temperature of 10 MeV, dark matter
must be produced with a Lorentz factor $\gamma \lesssim 550$.

small, the energy eigenvalues and instability rates can be computed
analytically. Since the solutions vary rapidly near the black hole horizon,
ordinary perturbative approximations fail and we must use matched asymptotic
expansions to determine the spectra. Our analytical treatment relies on the
separability of the equations of motion, and is therefore only applicable to
the scalar field and the electric modes of the vector field. However, for
slowly-rotating black holes, the equations for the magnetic modes can be
written in a separable form, which we exploit to derive their energy
eigenvalues and conjecture an analytic form for their instability rates. To
check our conjecture, and to extend all results to large values of $\alpha$, we
solve for the spectra numerically. We explain how to accurately and efficiently
compute these spectra, without relying on separability. This allows us to
obtain reliable results for any $\alpha \gtrsim 0.001$ and black holes of

generic intervals on the cutoff slice. It has been proposed that the field
theory dual of this scenario is a strongly coupled CFT, deformed by a certain
irrelevant deformation -- the so-called $T\bar T$ deformation. Surprisingly, we
find that we may write the entanglement entropies formally in the same way as
the entanglement entropy for antipodal points on the sphere by introducing an
effective radius $R_\text{eff}=R\,\cos(\beta_\epsilon)$, where $R$ is the
radius of the sphere and $\beta_\epsilon$ related to the length of the

trajectory until the generic interval corresponds to antipodal points on the
sphere. Finally, we check our results by comparing the asymptotic behavior (no
Dirichlet wall present) with the results of Casini, Huerta and Myers. We then
switch on counterterms on the cutoff slice which are important with regards to
the field theory calculation. We explicitly compute the contributions of the
counterterms to the entanglement entropy by considering the Wald entropy. In
the second part of this work, we extend the field theory calculation of the
entanglement entropy for antipodal points for a $d$-dimensional field theory in

compared them with the widely used power-law model with an exponential

parameter space which fully contains the observed values. Exploiting the
increasing number of high-energy cut-offs quoted in the literature, we report
on the comparison of physical quantities obtained using MoCA with those

fainter than those in high-mass and passive hosts, after light-curve
corrections with SALT2 and MLCS2k2, respectively. When only local environments
of SNe Ia (e.g., locally star-forming and locally passive) are considered, this
luminosity difference increases to $0.081\pm0.018$ mag for SALT2 and
$0.072\pm0.018$ mag for MLCS2k2. Considering the significant difference in the
mean stellar population age between the two environments, this result suggests
that the origin of environmental dependence is most likely the luminosity
evolution of SNe Ia with redshift.

Telescope (EHT) has the shape of a crescent extending from the E to WSW
position angles, while the observed direction of the large-scale jet is WNW.
Images based on numerical simulations of BH accretion flows suggest that on
average the projected BH spin axis should be oriented SSW. We explore highly
simplified toy models for geometric distribution and kinematics of emitting
regions in the Kerr metric, perform ray tracing to calculate the corresponding
images, and simulate their observation by the EHT to calculate the
corresponding visibilities and closure phases. We strictly assume that (1) the
BH spin vector is fixed to the jet axis, (2) the emitting regions are
stationary and symmetric with respect to the BH spin, and that (3) the
emissivities are isotropic in the local rest frames. Emission from the crescent
sector between SSE and WSW can be readily explained in terms of an equatorial
ring with either circular or plunging geodesic flows, regardless of the value
of BH spin. In the case of plane-symmetric polar caps with plunging geodesic
flows, the dominant image of the cap located behind the BH is sensitive to the
angular momentum of the emitter. Within the constraints of our model, we have
not found a viable explanation for the observed brightness of the ESE sector.
Most likely, the ESE ""hotspot"" has been produced by a non-stationary localised
perturbation in the inner accretion flow. Alternatively, it could result from
locally anisotropic synchrotron emissivities. Multi-epoch and polarimetric
results from the EHT will be essential to verify the theoretically expected
alignment of the BH spin with the large-scale jet.

Scattered or polarized light observations are mostly sensitive to small dust
grains that are released from the grinding down of bigger planetesimals. High
angular resolution observations at optical wavelengths can provide key
constraints on the radial and azimuthal distribution of the small dust grains.
These constraints can help us better understand where most of the dust grains
are released upon collisions. We present SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations of the
debris disk around HR 4796 A, and model the radial profiles along several
azimuthal angles of the disk with a code that accounts for the effect of
stellar radiation pressure. This enables us to derive an appropriate
description for the radial and azimuthal distribution of the small dust grains.
Even though we only model the radial profiles along (or close to) the
semi-major axis of the disk, our best-fit model is not only in good agreement
with our observations but also with previously published datasets (from near-IR
to sub-mm wavelengths). We find that the reference radius is located at
$76.4\pm0.4$ au, and the disk has an eccentricity of $0.076_{-0.010}^{+0.016}$,
with the pericenter located on the front side of the disk (north of the star).
We find that small dust grains must be preferentially released near the
pericenter to explain the observed brightness asymmetry. Even though parent
bodies spend more time near the apocenter, the brightness asymmetry implies
that collisions happen more frequently near the pericenter of the disk. Our
model can successfully reproduce the shape of the outer edge of the disk,
without having to invoke an outer planet shepherding the debris disk. With a
simple treatment of the effect of the radiation pressure, we conclude that the
parent planetesimals are located in a narrow ring of about $3.6$ au in width.

indistinguishable from the point of view of the bath they interact with. In
particular, delocalised excitations corresponding to coherent superposition of
excited states appear and change drastically the dynamics and steady state of
the systems. Such phenomena, which are central mechanisms of superradiance,
present interesting properties for thermodynamics and potentially other quantum
technologies. Indeed, a recent paper [Phys. Rev. A 99, 052105 (2019)] studies
these properties in a pair of indistinguishable two-level systems and points
out surprising effects of mitigation and amplification of the bath's action on
the energy and entropy of the pair. Here, we generalise the study to ensembles
of arbitrary number of spins of arbitrary size (i.e. dimension). We confirm
that the previously uncovered mitigation and amplification effects remain, but
also that they become more and more pronounced with growing number of spins and
growing spin size. Moreover, we find that the free energy variation and the
entropy production associated with the bath-driven dissipation are
systematically reduced, formalising the idea of mitigation of the bath's
action. Most remarkably, the combination of mitigation effects from two baths
at different temperatures can result in amplifying their action. This is
illustrated with cyclic thermal machines, and leads to large power
enhancements. The reduction of irreversibility is also an interesting aspect
since irreversibility is known to limit the performance of thermodynamic tasks.
The above findings might also lead to interesting applications in collective
work extraction, quantum battery charging, state protection, light harvesting
devices, quantum biology, but also for the study of entropy production.
Moreover, some experimental realisations and observations suggest that such
effects are within reach.

eastward propagating equatorial disturbances, similar in some respects to the
Madden--Julian oscillation, arise. We construct a simple, explicit system
consisting only of the shallow water equations plus a humidity variable;
moisture enters via evaporation from a wet surface, is transported by the flow
and removed by condensation, so providing a mass source to the height field.
For a broad range of parameters the system is excitable and self-sustaining,
even if linearly stable, with condensation producing convergence and gravity
waves that, acting together, trigger more condensation. On the equatorial
beta-plane the convection first aggregates near the equator, generating
patterns related to those in the Matsuno--Gill problem. However, the pattern is
unsteady and more convection is triggered on its eastern edge, leading to a
precipitating disturbance that progresses eastward. The effect is enhanced by
westward prevailing winds that increase the evaporation east of the
disturbance. The pattern is confined to a region within a few deformation radii
of equator because here the convection can best create the convergence needed
to organize into a self-sustaining pattern. Formation of the disturbance
preferentially occurs where the surface is warmer and sufficient time (a few
tens of days) must pass before conditions arise that enable the disturbance to
reform, as is characteristic both of excitable systems and the MJO itself. The
speed of the disturbance depends on the efficiency of evaporation and the heat
released by condensation, and is typically a few meters per second, much less
than the Kelvin wave speed.

a highly nonlinear fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with cubic-quintic-septic
nonlinearities. We demonstrate that the device shows novel bi-(multi-) stable
states in the broken regime as a direct consequence of the shift in the
photonic band gap influenced by both $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and higher-order
nonlinearities. We also numerically depict that such FBGs provide a productive
test bed where the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime can be exploited to
set up all-optical applications such as binary switches, multi-level signal
processing and optical computing. Unlike optical bistability (OB) in the
traditional and unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric FBG, it exhibits many
peculiar features such as flat-top stable states and ramp like input-output
characteristics before the onset of OB phenomenon in the broken regime. The
gain/loss parameter plays a dual role in controlling the switching intensities
between the stable states which is facilitated by reversing the direction of
light incidence. We also find that the gain/loss parameter tailors the
formation of gap solitons pertaining to transmission resonances which clearly
indicates that it can be employed to set up optical storage devices. Moreover,
the interplay between gain/loss and higher order nonlinearities brings notable
changes in the nonlinear reflection spectra of the system under constant pump
powers. The influence of each control parameters on the switching operation is
also presented in a nutshell to validate that FBG offers more degrees of
freedom in controlling light with light.

Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles in a large-scale

testbed, this paper examines the impacts of four managed lane strategies for
the near-term deployment of CACC vehicles under mixed traffic conditions.
Network-wide performance measures are investigated from the perspectives of
mobility, safety, equity, and environmental impacts. In addition, the platoon
formation performance of CACC vehicles is evaluated with platoon-orientated
measures, such as the percentage of platooned CACC vehicles, average platoon
depth, and vehicle-hour-platooned that is proposed in this paper under the
imperfect DSRC communication environment. Moreover, managed lane score matrices
are developed to incorporate heterogeneous categories of performance measures,
aiming to provide a more comprehensive picture for stakeholders. The results
show that mixing CACC traffic along with non-CACC traffic across all travel
lanes is an acceptable option when the market penetration (MP) is lower than
30% for roadways where a managed lane is absent. Providing CACC with priority
access to an existing managed lane, if available, is also a good strategy for
improving the overall traffic performance when the MP is lower than 40%. When
the MP reaches above 40%, a dedicated lane for CACC vehicles is recommended, as
it provides greater opportunity for CACC vehicles to form platoons. The
facilitation of homogeneous CACC traffic flow could make further improvements
possible in the future.

The F1-scores for the best detector and tracker alone (SSD and Median Flow)

measure all linear polarization states in one exposure. The instrument has been
on-sky since February 2017 and we found that the systematic errors, likely
arising from flat fielding and gravity effects on the instrument, limit our

allows us to determine long sought-after interface properties, such as local
fracture energy and frictional peak strength. Both properties are observed to
be roughly independent of rupture speed and mode of propagation. However, our
study also reveals discrepancies between measurements and analytical solutions

Further comparison with dynamic simulations illustrates that, in the supershear
propagation regime, transient and geometrical (finite sample thickness) effects
cause smaller near-tip strain amplitudes than expected from the

signals are important for wearable sensors and devices. Deep Learning (DL)
models have been used extensively in image processing and other domains with
great success but only very recently have been used in processing ECG signals.
This paper presents several DL models namely Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
together with the more conventional filtering methods (low pass filtering, high
pass filtering, Notch filtering) and the standard wavelet-based technique for
denoising EEG signals. These methods are trained, tested and evaluated on
different synthetic and real ECG datasets taken from the MIT PhysioNet database
and for different simulation conditions (i.e. various lengths of the ECG
signals, single or multiple records). The results show the CNN model is a
performant model that can be used for off-line denoising ECG applications where
it is satisfactory to train on a clean part of an ECG signal from an ECG
record, and then to test on the same ECG signal, which would have some high
level of noise added to it. However, for real-time applications or near-real
time applications, this task becomes more cumbersome, as the clean part of an
ECG signal is very probable to be very limited in size. Therefore the solution
put forth in this work is to train a CNN model on 1 second ECG noisy artificial
multiple heartbeat data (i.e. ECG at effort), which was generated in a first
instance based on few sequences of real signal heartbeat ECG data (i.e. ECG at
rest). Afterwards it would be possible to use the trained CNN model in real
life situations to denoise the ECG signal.

with spectroscopic redshift ($z$) from the Swift XRT repository as well as over
100 Ly\,$\alpha$ absorption measurements in $z>1.6$ sources. The observed trend
of the average optical depth $\tau$ at 0.5 keV is consistent with both a sharp
increase of host $N_{\rm H}(z)$, and an absorbing diffuse intergalactic medium,
along with decreasing host contribution to $\tau$. We analyze a sub-sample of
high-$z$ GRBs with $N_{\rm H}$ derived both from the X-ray afterglow and the
Ly\,$\alpha$ line. The increase of X-ray derived $N_{\rm H}(z)$ is contrasted
by no such increase in the Ly\,$\alpha$ derived column density. We argue that
this discrepancy implies a lack of association between the X-ray and

high $z$ being dominated by an intervening absorber, which lends credibility to
an absorbing intergalactic medium contribution.

further supported by a human evaluation that rated dialogues in terms of
fluency, engagingness and consistency -- which revealed that our proposed
dialogue rewards strongly correlate with human judgements.

We study discretizations of an Euler-Lagrange equation which generate a large
class of accelerated methods whose convergence rate is $O(\frac{1}{t^p})$ in
continuous-time, where parameter $p$ is the order of the optimization method.
Specifically, we address the question asking why a naive explicit-implicit
Euler discretization of this solution produces an unstable algorithm, even for
a strongly convex objective function. We prove that for a strongly convex
$L$-smooth quadratic objective function and step size $\delta<\frac{1}{L}$, the
naive discretization will exhibit stable behavior when the number of iterations
$k$ satisfies the inequality $k < (\frac{4}{Lp^2 \delta^p})^{\frac{1}{p-2}}$.

transition; (ii) systems that are strongly disordered, but obstructed from
localizing because of symmetry, interaction range, or dimensionality; (iii)
multiple-component systems, in which some components would in isolation be MBL
but others are not; and finally (iv) driven systems whose dynamics lead to
exponentially slow rates of heating to infinite temperature. A theme common to
many of these problems is that they can be understood in terms of approximately
localized degrees of freedom coupled to a heat bath (or baths) consisting of
thermal degrees of freedom; however, this putative bath is itself nontrivial,
being either small or very slowly relaxing. We discuss anomalous transport,
diverging relaxation times, and other signatures of the proximity to MBL in
these systems. We also survey recent theoretical and numerical methods that
have been applied to study dynamics on either side of the MBL transition.

conformal bootstrap techniques in the large spin limit. We focus on the
constraints imposed by conformal symmetry on the four point function of certain
logarithmic scalar operators and compute the leading correction to the
anomalous dimension of double trace operators in the large spin limit. There
exist certain holographic duals to such LogCFTs, which involve higher
derivative equations of motion. The anomalous dimension is related to the
binding energy of a state where two scalars rotate around each other with a
large angular momentum. We compute this energy shift and compare it to the
anomalous dimension of the large spin double trace operators due to stress
tensor exchange in the LogCFT. Our result shows that the cluster decomposition
principle is satisfied for LogCFTs as long as the dimensions of the operators
are positive.

leading $\mathcal{O}\left(1/Q^2\right)$ correction to the extremality bound is
calculated from the most general low-energy effective action containing
operators with up to four derivatives. Motivated by the multi-charge
generalization of the Weak Gravity Conjecture, we analyze the necessary

into a multi-particle state of finite charge extremal black holes. In the large

requirement that a certain quartic form, constructed from the Wilson
coefficients of the four-derivative effective operators, is everywhere
positive. Using on-shell unitarity methods, we show that higher-derivative
operators are renormalized at one-loop only if they generate local, on-shell
matrix elements that are invariant tensors of the electromagnetic duality group
$U(N)$. The one-loop logarithmic running of the four-derivative Wilson
coefficients is calculated and shown to imply the positivity of the extremality

taking advantage of a neighborhood-relational encoding (NRE) among the training

networks to understand the primitive characteristics of the visual data, mainly
to be able to reconstruct the data from a latent space. They often neglected
the relation among the samples, which can serve as an important metric for
self-supervision. Different from the previous work, NRE aims at preserving the
local neighborhood structure on the data manifold. Therefore, it is less
sensitive to outliers. We integrate our NRE component with an encoder-decoder
structure for learning to represent samples considering their local
neighborhood information. Such discriminative and unsupervised representation
learning scheme is adaptable to different computer vision tasks due to its
independence from intense annotation requirements. We evaluate our proposed
method for different tasks, including classification, detection, and
segmentation based on the learned latent representations. In addition, we adopt
the auto-encoding capability of our proposed method for applications like
defense against adversarial example attacks and video anomaly detection.
Results confirm the performance of our method is better or at least comparable

geographically dispersed and nomadic populations, last-mile vaccine delivery
can be extremely complex. Because newborns in remote population centers often
do not have direct access to clinics and hospitals, they face significant risk
from diseases and infections. An approach known as outreach is typically
utilized to raise immunization rates in these situations. A set of these remote
locations is chosen, and over an appropriate planning period, teams of
clinicians and support personnel are sent from a depot to set up mobile clinics
at these locations to vaccinate people there and in the immediate surrounding
area. In this paper, we model the problem of optimally designing outreach
efforts as a mixed integer program that is a combination of a set covering
problem and a vehicle routing problem. In addition, because elements relevant
to outreach (such as populations and road conditions) are often unstable and
unpredictable, we address uncertainty and determine the worst-case solutions.
This is done using a multi-period stochastic modeling approach that considers
updated model parameter estimates and revised plans for subsequent planning
periods. We also conduct numerical experiments to provide insights on how
demographic characteristics affect outreach planning and where outreach
planners should focus their attention when gathering data.

for datasets containing regression target values characterizing disease
severity. We use a conditional generative adversarial network where the
generator attempts to learn to shift the output of a regressor through creating
disease effect maps that are added to the original images. Meanwhile, the
regressor is trained to predict the original regression value for the modified

how the image would appear at different stages of the disease. We analyze our

electricity and water infrastructure that enable the production, distribution,

power is used to produce, treat, distribute, and recycle water while water is
used to generate and consume electricity. In the meantime, significant
attention has been given to renewable energy integration within the context of
global climate change. While these two issues may seem unrelated, their
resolution is potentially synergistic in that renewable energy technologies not
only present low CO2 emissions but also low water-intensities. Furthermore,
because water is readily stored, it has the potential to act as a flexible
energy resource on both the supply and the demand-side of the electricity grid.
Despite these synergies, the renewable energy integration and energy-water
nexus literature have yet to methodologically converge to systematically
address potential synergies. This paper advances an enterprise control
methodology as a means of assessing the techno-economic performance of the
energy water nexus. The enterprise control methodology has been developed in
recent years to advance the methodological state of the art of renewable energy
integration studies and used recently to carry out a full-scale study for the
Independent System Operator (ISO) New England system. The methodology
quantifies day-ahead and real-time energy market production costs, dispatched
energy mixes, required operating reserves, levels of curtailment, and grid
imbalances. This energy-water nexus methodological extension now includes
flexible water-energy resources within the grid's energy resource portfolio and
quantifies the amounts of water withdrawn and consumed. The simulation
methodology is demonstrated on a modified version of the RTS-96 (RTS-GMLC) test
case.

POLITEX algorithm, a version of policy iteration where the policy produced in
each iteration is near-optimal in hindsight for the sum of all past value
function estimates. POLITEX has sublinear regret guarantees in uniformly-mixing
MDPs when the value estimation error can be controlled, which can be satisfied
if all policies sufficiently explore the environment. Unfortunately, this
assumption is often unrealistic. Motivated by the rapid growth of interest in
developing policies that learn to explore their environment in the lack of
rewards (also known as no-reward learning), we replace the previous assumption
that all policies explore the environment with that a single, sufficiently
exploring policy is available beforehand. The main contribution of the paper is
the modification of POLITEX to incorporate such an exploration policy in a way
that allows us to obtain a regret guarantee similar to the previous one but
without requiring that all policies explore environment. In addition to the
novel theoretical guarantees, we demonstrate the benefits of our scheme on
environments which are difficult to explore using simple schemes like
dithering. While the solution we obtain may not achieve the best possible
regret, it is the first result that shows how to control the regret in the
presence of function approximation errors on problems where exploration is
nontrivial. Our approach can also be seen as a way of reducing the problem of
minimizing the regret to learning a good exploration policy. We believe that
modular approaches like ours can be highly beneficial in tackling harder

network are ignored by these methods, leading to contradictory outputs when
matching results from different camera pairs are combined. In this paper, we
address the problem of unsupervised video-based re-identification by proposing
a consistent cross-view matching (CCM) framework, in which global camera
network constraints are exploited to guarantee the matched pairs are with
consistency. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the first neighbor of
each sample to discover relations among samples and find the groups in each
camera. Additionally, a cross-view matching strategy followed by global camera
network constraints is proposed to explore the matching relationships across
the entire camera network. Finally, we learn metric models for camera pairs
progressively by alternatively mining consistent cross-view matching pairs and
updating metric models using these obtained matches. Rigorous experiments on
two widely-used benchmarks for video re-identification demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over current state-of-the-art unsupervised
methods; for example, on the MARS dataset, our method achieves an improvement
of 4.2\% over unsupervised methods, and even 2.5\% over one-shot
supervision-based methods for rank-1 accuracy.

generate a large number of configurations for which additional off-minimum

is trained on these data to provide a correction to energies and forces

machine learning model is tailored to the amount of available training data.
The parametrization of large systems is enabled by a fragmentation approach.
Due to their modular nature, all model construction steps allow for model
improvement in a rolling fashion. Our approach may also be employed for the

different methods of increasing the supercapacitor performance of the
perovskite SrCoO3. We carry out first-principles calculations to systematically
study how SrCoO3/graphene interface, oxygen vacancies, and doping improve the
performance of strontium cobaltite as an anion-intercalation-type

relatively stable with a formation energy of 1.3 eV and is highly conductive,
which makes it a promising material for supercapacitors. We also find that
inducing oxygen vacancies in SrCoO3 significantly increases the conductivity of
this material. Results of doping calculations reveal that doping with Mo, V, P,

niobium is the most stable and most conductive of all four dopants. In

invalidating the security protection provided by the Secure Connection Only

  Specifically, we examine the life cycle of a BLE pairing process in Android

Network (DNN) classifiers, known as a backdoor, was proposed. These attacks do
not seek to degrade classification accuracy, but rather to have the classifier
learn to classify to a target class whenever the backdoor pattern is present in
a test example. Launching backdoor attacks does not require knowledge of the
classifier or its training process - it only needs the ability to poison the
training set with (a sufficient number of) exemplars containing a sufficiently
strong backdoor pattern (labeled with the target class). Here we address
post-training detection of backdoor attacks in DNN image classifiers, seldom
considered in existing works, wherein the defender does not have access to the
poisoned training set, but only to the trained classifier itself, as well as to
clean examples from the classification domain. This is an important scenario
because a trained classifier may be the basis of e.g. a phone app that will be
shared with many users. Detecting backdoors post-training may thus reveal a
widespread attack. We propose a purely unsupervised anomaly detection (AD)
defense against imperceptible backdoor attacks that: i) detects whether the
trained DNN has been backdoor-attacked; ii) infers the source and target
classes involved in a detected attack; iii) we even demonstrate it is possible
to accurately estimate the backdoor pattern. We test our AD approach, in
comparison with alternative defenses, for several backdoor patterns, data sets,
and attack settings and demonstrate its favorability. Our defense essentially
requires setting a single hyperparameter (the detection threshold), which can
e.g. be chosen to fix the system's false positive rate.

large-scale millimetre wave (mmWave) antenna arrays. By fully exploiting the
sparse nature of the mmWave channel, such hybrid beamforming reduces complexity
and power consumption when compared with a structure based on phase shifters.
However, the difficulty of designing an optimum beamformer in the analog domain
is prohibitive due to the binary nature of such a switch-based structure. Thus,
here we propose a new method for designing a switch-based hybrid beamformer for
massive MIMO communications in mmWave bands. We first propose a method for
decoupling the joint optimization of analog and digital beamformers by
confining the problem to a rank-constrained subspace. We then approximate the
solution through two approaches: norm maximization (SHD-NM), and majorization
(SHD-QRQU). In the norm maximization method, we propose a modified sequential
convex programming (SCP) procedure that maximizes the mutual information while
addressing the mismatch incurred from approximating the log-determinant by a
Frobenius norm. In the second method, we employ a lower bound on the mutual
information by QR factorization. We also introduce linear constraints in order
to include frequently-used partially-connected structures. Finally, we show the
feasibility, and effectiveness of the proposed methods through several
numerical examples. The results demonstrate ability of the proposed methods to
track closely the spectral efficiency provided by unconstrained optimal

test is no longer the most powerful statistical test even though it is still
valid. Nevertheless, the log-rank test and the hazard ratio are still the
primary analysis tools, and traditional approaches such as sample size increase
are still proposed to account for the impact of non-proportional hazards. The
weighed log-rank test and the test based on the restricted mean survival time

machine learning, statistics and various applied domains. Inspired by the
success of ensemble methods and the flexibility of trees, we propose to learn a
similarity kernel called rpf-kernel through random projection forests
(rpForests). Our theoretical analysis reveals a highly desirable property of
rpf-kernel: far-away (dissimilar) points have a low similarity value while
nearby (similar) points would have a high similarity}, and the similarities
have a native interpretation as the probability of points remaining in the same
leaf nodes during the growth of rpForests. The learned rpf-kernel leads to an
effective clustering algorithm--rpfCluster. On a wide variety of real and
benchmark datasets, rpfCluster compares favorably to K-means clustering,
spectral clustering and a state-of-the-art clustering ensemble
algorithm--Cluster Forests. Our approach is simple to implement and readily
adapt to the geometry of the underlying data. Given its desirable theoretical
property and competitive empirical performance when applied to clustering, we
expect rpf-kernel to be applicable to many problems of an unsupervised nature
or as a regularizer in some supervised or weakly supervised settings.

from $11.4\pm2.2$ K in the coldest cloud (MonR1) to $23.0\pm6.5$ K in the
warmest cloud (M17). Using dendrograms on the NH$_3$ (1,1) integrated intensity

In the present work, we applied generative adversarial networks (GANs), a
representative of unsupervised learning, to generate an inlet boundary
condition of turbulent channel flow. Upon learning the two-dimensional spatial
structure of turbulence using data obtained from direct numerical simulation
(DNS) of turbulent channel flow, the GAN could generate instantaneous flow
fields that are statistically similar to those of DNS. Surprisingly, the GAN
could produce fields at various Reynolds numbers without any additional
simulation based on the trained data of only three Reynolds numbers. This
indicates that the GAN could learn the universal nature of Reynolds number
effect and might reflect other simulation conditions. Eventually, through a
combination of the GAN and a recurrent neural network (RNN), we developed a
novel model (RNN-GAN) that could generate time-varying fully developed flow for
a long time. The spatiotemporal correlations of the generated flow are in good
agreement with those of the DNS. This proves the usefulness of unsupervised
learning in the generation of synthetic turbulence fields.

proposes a new coarse-to-fine single image deraining framework termed
Multi-stream Hybrid Deraining Network (shortly, MH-DerainNet). To obtain the
negative rain streaks during training process more accurately, we present a new
module named dual path residual dense block, i.e., Residual path and Dense

layers while the Dense path can explore new features. In addition, to
concatenate different scaled features, we also apply the idea of multi-stream
with shortcuts between cascaded dual path residual dense block based streams.
To obtain more distinct derained images, we combine the SSIM loss and
perceptual loss to preserve the per-pixel similarity as well as preserving the
global structures so that the deraining result is more accurate. Extensive
experi-ments on both synthetic and real rainy images demonstrate that our
MH-DerainNet can deliver significant improvements over several recent

independent control of the different DOFs. Gain were significantly greater than
one and served to amplify participant effort. Optimal modifications can be
determined quickly offline and translate to functional improvements online.
Using a portable take-home system, participants performed various activities of
daily living. Comparison with Existing Methods: In contrast to pattern
recognition, the MKF allows users to continuously modulate their force output,

strategy for increasing the profitability of farming and reducing the
environmental load from agriculture. Subsurface irrigation can be an
alternative to surface irrigation as a means of losing less irrigation water,
but the application timing and amount are often difficult to determine.
Well-defined soil and crop models are useful for assisting decision support,
but most of the models developed to date have been for surface irrigation. The
present study examines whether the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology
Transfer (DSSAT, version 4.5) cropping system model is applicable for the
production of processing tomatoes with subsurface irrigation, and it revises
the soil module to simulate irrigation schemes with subsurface irrigation. Five
farmed fields in California, USA, are used to test the performance of the
model. The original DSSAT model fails to produce fruit yield by overestimating
the water deficiency. The soil water module is then revised by introducing the
movement of soil moisture due to a vertical soil moisture gradient. Moreover,
an external parameter optimization system is constructed to minimize the error
between the simulation and observations. The revised module reduces the errors
in the soil moisture profile at each field compared to those by the original
DSSAT model. The average soil moisture error decreases from 0.065m^3/m^3 to
0.029m^3/m^3. The yields estimated by the modified model are in a reasonable
range from 80 to 150 ton/ha, which is commonly observed under well-managed
conditions. The present results show that although further testing is required
for yield prediction, the present modification to the original DSSAT model
improves the precision of the soil moisture profile under subsurface irrigation

on long-slit spectroscopy to measure the pattern speeds of bars ($\Omega_{\rm
p}$) in disk galaxies. Using a simulated galaxy, we investigate the potential
biases and uncertainties of TW measurements using increasingly popular
integral-field spectrographs (IFSs), for which multiple pseudo-slits (and thus
independent measurements) can be constructed with a single observation. Most
important, to establish the spatial coverage required and ensure the validity
of the measurements, the inferred $\Omega_{\rm p}$ must asymptotically converge
as the (half-)length of each pseudo-slit used is increased. The requirement for
our simulation is to reach $\approx1.3$ times the half-light radius, but this
may vary from galaxy to galaxy. Only those slits located within the bar region
yield accurate measurements. We confirm that the position angle of the disk is
the dominant source of systematic error in TW $\Omega_{\rm p}$ measurements,
leading to under/overestimates of tens of percents for inaccuracies of even a
few degrees. Recasting the data so that the data grid aligns with the disk
major axis leads to slightly reduced uncertainties. Accurate measurements are
obtained only for well-defined ranges of the bar angle (relative to the galaxy
major axis) $\phi_{\rm bar}$ and the inclination angle $i$, here
$10\lesssim\phi_{\rm bar}\lesssim75^{\circ}$ and $105\lesssim\phi_{\rm
bar}\lesssim170^{\circ}$ and $15\lesssim i\lesssim70^{\circ}$. The adopted
(pseudo-)slit widths, spatial resolution, and (unless extremely aggressive)
spatial binning of IFS data have no significant impact on the measurements. Our
results thus provide useful guidelines for reliable and accurate direct
$\Omega_{\rm p}$ measurements with IFS observations.

scattering problem in locally inhomogeneous media. The key idea is to enclose
the inhomogeneity of the media by well separated artificial boundaries and then
apply purely outgoing wave decomposition for the scattering field outside the
enclosed region. As a result, the original multiple scattering problem can be
decomposed into a finite number of single scattering problems, where each of
them communicates with the other scattering problems only through its
surrounding artificial boundary. Accordingly, they can be solved in a parallel
manner at each iteration. This framework enjoys a great flexibility in using
different combinations of iterative algorithms and single scattering problem
solvers. The spectral element method seamlessly integrated with the
non-reflecting boundary condition and the GMRES iteration is advocated and
implemented in this work. The convergence of the proposed method is proved by
using the compactness of involved integral operators. Ample numerical examples
are presented to show its high accuracy and efficiency.

computational cost of implicit time discretizations is dominated by the
solution of nonlinear systems of equations at each time step. In order to
decrease this cost, the recently developed Rosenbrock-Krylov (ROK) time
integration methods extend the classical linearly-implicit Rosenbrock(-W)
methods, and make use of a Krylov subspace approximation to the Jacobian
computed via an Arnoldi process. Since the ROK order conditions rely on the
construction of a single Krylov space, no restarting of the Arnoldi process is
allowed, and the iterations quickly become expensive with increasing subspace
dimensions. This work extends the ROK framework to make use of the Lanczos
biorthogonalization procedure for constructing Jacobian approximations. The
resulting new family of methods is named biorthogonal ROK (BOROK). The Lanczos
procedure's short two-term recurrence allows BOROK methods to utilize larger
subspaces for the Jacobian approximation, resulting in increased numerical
stability of the time integration at a reduced computational cost. Adaptive
subspace size selection and basis extension procedures are also developed for
the new schemes. Numerical experiments show that for stiff problems, where a
large subspace used to approximate the Jacobian is required for stability, the
BOROK methods outperform the original ROK methods.

thin free-standing films, have revealed unexpected finite size effects in which
the variance of the properties vary monotonically with the in-plane width of
the films, complicating the extrapolation of estimates of film properties to
the thermodynamic limit. We carried out molecular dynamics simulations to
determine the origin of this phenomenon, and to address the practical problem
of developing a more reliable methodology for estimating the surface tension in
the thermodynamic limit. We find that there are two distinct finite size
effects that must be addressed in a finite size analysis of the surface tension
in thin films. The first finite size scale is the in-plane width of the films
and the second scale is the simulation cell size in the transverse direction.
Increasing the first scale enhances fluctuations in the surface tension,
measured by the standard deviation of their distribution, while increasing the
second reduces the surface tension fluctuations due to a corresponding
increased ""freedom"" of the film to fluctuate out of plane. We find that by
using progressively large simulation cells in the transverse direction, while
keeping the film width fixed to an extent in which the full bulk liquid zone is
developed, allows us to obtain a smooth extrapolation to the thermodynamic
limit, enabling a reduction of the surface tension uncertainty to a magnitude
on the order of 1% for systems having a reasonable large size, i.e., O(1
micrometer).

the translational one remains diffusive. We argue that the activation barrier

can affect the geometric phase very significantly even for weak and moderate
system-environment coupling strengths. Moreover, the correction to the
geometric phase due to the system-environment coupling generally becomes
smaller (and can even be zero) if initial system-environment correlations are
taken into account, thus implying that the system-environment correlations can
increase the robustness of the geometric phase.

to identify successively better connected subgraphs. Since in many domains the
underlying graph changes over time, its associated truss decomposition needs to
be updated as well. This work focuses on the problem of incrementally updating
an existing truss decomposition and makes the following three significant
contributions. First, it presents a theory that identifies how the truss
decomposition can change as new edges get added. Second, it develops an
efficient incremental algorithm that incorporates various optimizations to
update the truss decomposition after every edge addition. These optimizations
are designed to reduce the number of edges that are explored by the algorithm.
Third, it extends this algorithm to batch updates (i.e., where the truss
decomposition needs to be updated after a set of edges are added), which
reduces the overall computations that need to be performed. We evaluated the
performance of our algorithms on real-world datasets. Our incremental algorithm
achieves over 250000x average speedup for inserting an edge in a graph with 10
million edges relative to the non-incremental algorithm. Further, our
experiments on batch updates show that our batch algorithm consistently
performs better than the incremental algorithm.

aligns the conditional distributions by using the soft-label strategy of

an adaptive coefficient to gradually increase the importance of the soft-labels

For an elliptically polarized field, it is found that the number density of

Moreover, the degree of spin polarization roughly grows as the Keldysh

classification and propose a generic hallucination architecture considering
that all the available sensor information are present during training while
some of the image modalities may be absent while testing. It is well-known that
different sensors are capable of capturing complementary information for a
given geographical area and a classification module incorporating information
from all the sources are expected to produce an improved performance as
compared to considering only a subset of the modalities. However, the classical
classifier systems inherently require all the features used to train the module
to be present for the test instances as well, which may not always be possible
for typical remote sensing applications (say, disaster management). As a
remedy, we provide a robust solution in terms of a hallucination module that
can approximate the missing modalities from the available ones during the
decision-making stage. In order to ensure better knowledge transfer during
modality hallucination, we explicitly incorporate concepts of knowledge
distillation for the purpose of exploring the privileged (side) information in
our framework and subsequently introduce an intuitive modular training
approach. The proposed network is evaluated extensively on a large-scale corpus
of PAN-MS image pairs (scene recognition) as well as on a benchmark

spherical Benjamin-Ono (sBO) equation. Whitham modulation equations are derived

demonstrates its utility in greatly speeding up the process of identifying

comparison needed to find similar pairs in a set of $n$ elements such as
protein sequences. Precise clustering ensures that each pair of similar
elements appears together in at least one cluster, so that similarities can be
identified by all-to-all comparison in each cluster rather than on the full
set. This paper introduces ClusterMerge, a new algorithm for precise clustering
that uses transitive relationships among the elements to enable parallel and
scalable implementations of this approach. We apply ClusterMerge to the
important problem of finding similar amino acid sequences in a collection of
proteins. ClusterMerge identifies 99.8% of similar pairs found by a full
$O(n^2)$ comparison, with only half as many operations. More importantly,
ClusterMerge is highly amenable to parallel and distributed computation. Our
implementation achieves a speedup of 604$\times$ on 768 cores (1400$\times$
faster than a comparable single-threaded clustering implementation), a strong
scaling efficiency of 90%, and a weak scaling efficiency of nearly 100%.

design a Graph Neural Network based model to represent relationships among
multiple traffic lights, and the decision for each traffic light will be made

PageRank (PPR) of $t$ with respect to $s$ is the probability that a random walk
starting from $s$ terminates at $t$. An important variant of the PPR query is
single-source PPR (SSPPR), which enumerates all nodes in $G$, and returns the
top-$k$ nodes with the highest PPR values with respect to a given source $s$.
PPR in general and SSPPR in particular have important applications in web
search and social networks, e.g., in Twitter's Who-To-Follow recommendation
service. However, PPR computation is known to be expensive on large graphs, and
resistant to indexing. Consequently, previous solutions either use heuristics,
which do not guarantee result quality, or rely on the strong computing power of
modern data centers, which is costly.
  Motivated by this, we propose effective index-free and index-based algorithms
for approximate PPR processing, with rigorous guarantees on result quality. We
first present FORA, an approximate SSPPR solution that combines two existing
methods Forward Push (which is fast but does not guarantee quality) and Monte
Carlo Random Walk (accurate but slow) in a simple and yet non-trivial way,
leading to both high accuracy and efficiency. Further, FORA includes a simple

high pruning power. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed

benchmark the performances of four different tDMRG methods, including global
Taylor, global Krylov, local one-site and two-site time-dependent variational

time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) and experimental results. Two typical chemical
systems of internal conversion and singlet fission are investigated, one
containing strong and high-order local and non-local electron-vibration

that the tDMRG methods (particularly, the 2TDVP method) can describe the full

key parameters in the tDMRG calculation including the truncation error
threshold, time interval and ordering of local sites were also investigated to

equations describing the evolution of self-gravitating and viscous

component consisting of two parts: sub-micron-sized dust and grown dust with a
variable maximum radius. The conversion of small to grown dust, dust growth,
friction of dust with gas, and dust self-gravity were also considered. We found
that the disk appearance is notably time-variable with spiral arms, dusty
rings, and clumps, constantly forming, evolving, and decaying. As a
consequence, the total dust-to-gas mass ratio is highly non-homogeneous
throughout the disk extent, showing order-of-magnitude local deviations from
the canonical 1:100 value. Gravitationally bound clumps formed through
gravitational fragmentation have a velocity pattern that deviates notably from
the Keplerian rotation. Small dust is efficiently converted into grown dust in
the clump interiors, reaching a maximum radius of several decimeters.
Concurrently, grown dust drifts towards the clump center forming a massive
compact central condensation (70-100 $M_\oplus$). We argue that protoplanets
may form in the interiors of inward migrating clumps before they disperse
through the action of tidal torques. We foresee the formation of protoplanets
at orbital distances of several tens of au with initial masses of gas and dust
in the protoplanetary seed in the (0.25-1.6) $M_{\rm Jup}$ and (1.0-5.5)
$M_\oplus$ limits, respectively. The final masses of gas and dust in the
protoplanets may however be much higher due to accretion from surrounding
massive metal-rich disks/envelopes.

three convolution layers, three dense layers, together with some batch

find a $2.5\%$ bias on the primordial amplitude $\sigma_8$ that can not easily
be resolved by continued training. We correct this bias to obtain unprecedented
accuracy in the cosmological parameter estimation with statistical
uncertainties of $\delta \Omega_m$=0.0015 and $\delta \sigma_8$=0.0029, which
are several times better than the results of previous CNN works. Compared with
a 2-point analysis method using clustering region of 0-130 and 10-130 $h^{-1}$

precise, respectively. Finally, we conduct preliminary checks of the

previous works, the tomographic AP method was performed via the anisotropic
2-point correlation function statistic. In this work we consider the
feasibility of conducting the analysis in the Fourier domain and examine the
pros and cons of this approach. We use the integrated galaxy power spectrum
(PS) as a function of direction, $\hat P_{\Delta k}(\mu)$, to quantify the
magnitude of anisotropy in the large-scale structure clustering, and use its
redshift variation to do the AP test. The method is tested on the large, high
resolution Big-MultiDark Planck (BigMD) simulation at redshifts $z=0-1$, using
the underlying true cosmology $\Omega_m=0.3071,\ w=-1$. Testing the redshift
evolution of $\hat P_{\Delta k}(\mu)$ in the true cosmology and cosmologies
deviating from the truth with $\delta \Omega_m=0.1,\ \delta w=0.3$, we find
that the redshift evolution of the AP distortion overwhelms the effects created
by the RSD by a factor of $\sim1.7-3.6$. We test the method in the range of
$k\in(0.2,1.8)\ h\ \rm Mpc^{-1}$, and find that it works well throughout the

effects of neutrino halo and collective neutrino oscillation are not
simultaneously large. Inside the shock, the impact of the inward-scattered halo
neutrino cannot in general be neglected compared to the outward-propagating
neutrino flux. However, during early epochs, collective neutrino oscillation is
effectively shut down by multi-angle matter suppression. During the
intermediate epoch, collective neutrino oscillation is not suppressed, but its
onset radius is beyond the still relatively small explosion shock front where
the halo is prominent. We also find in the case of the $9.6\, \rm M_\odot$
progenitor the halo neutrinos induce a delay in the onset of collective
neutrino oscillations. This causes novel flavor conversions which sharpen
collective neutrino oscillation spectral features. We predict that the
inclusion of neutrino halo effects makes neutrino signals that are more clearly
distinct from thermal emission that when halo neutrinos are omitted.

the possibility of estimating the systematics of the method using fast

non-zero redshift evolution of the RSD effects, which is quantified by
$\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(\mu,z)$ in our analysis, and estimated using the

inaccuracy in the 2pCFs computed using COLA, and find it 5-10 times smaller

using COLA to estimate the systematics is good enough. Finally, we test the

and optical properties. The family also includes the widely-used double-metal
cyanide (DMC) catalysts and the topical hexacyanoferrate/hexacyanomanganate

is the ability to transport mass reversibly, a process made possible by
structural vacancies. Normally presumed random, vacancy arrangements are
actually crucially important because they control the connectivity of the
micropore network, and hence diffusivity and adsorption profiles. The
long-standing obstacle to characterising PBA vacancy networks has always been
the relative inaccessibility of single-crystal samples. Here we report the
growth of single crystals of a range of PBAs. By measuring and interpreting
their X-ray diffuse scattering patterns, we identify for the first time a
striking diversity of non-random vacancy arrangements that is hidden from
conventional crystallographic analysis of powder samples. Moreover, we show
that this unexpected phase complexity can be understood in terms of a
remarkably simple microscopic model based on local rules of electroneutrality
and centrosymmetry. The hidden phase boundaries that emerge demarcate
vacancy-network polymorphs with profoundly different micropore characteristics.
Our results establish a clear foundation for correlated defect engineering in
PBAs as a means of controlling storage capacity, anisotropy, and transport
efficiency.

sensitivity to key properties of storage and transport in porous media. Its
quantitative use therefore depends on the efficiency of the petrophysical
relationship to link them. In this work, we develop a new physically based
model for estimating electrical conductivity of saturated porous media. The
model is derived assuming that the porous media is represented by a bundle of
tortuous capillary tubes with a fractal pore-size distribution. The model is
expressed in terms of the porosity, electrical conductivity of the pore liquid
and the microstructural parameters of porous media. It takes into account the
interface properties between minerals and pore water by introducing a surface
conductivity. Expressions for the formation factor and hydraulic tortuosity are
also obtained from the model derivation. The model is then successfully
compared with published data and performs better than previous models. The
proposed approach also permits to relate the electrical conductivity to other
transport properties such as the hydraulic conductivity.

direct way to provide insight of their atmospheric composition and to constrain
theoretical planetary atmosphere modelling. Wavelength-dependent albedo can be
inferred from the exoplanet's reflected light of the host star, but this is not
a trivial task. In fact, the planetary signal may be several orders of
magnitude lower ($10^{-4}$ or below) than the flux of the host star, thus
making its extraction very challenging. Successful detection of the planetary
signature of 51~Peg\,b has been recently obtained by using cross-correlation
function (CCF) or autocorrelation function (ACF) techniques. In this paper we
present an alternative method based on the use of Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). In comparison to the above-mentioned techniques, the main
advantages of ICA are that the extraction is \textit{""blind""} i.e. it does not
require any \textit{a priori} knowledge of the underlying signals, and that our
method allows us not only to detect the planet signal but also to estimate its
wavelength dependence. To show and quantify the effectiveness of our method we
successfully applied it to both simulated data and real data of an eclipsing
binary star system. Eventually, when applied to real 51~Peg~+~51~Peg\,b data,
our method extracts the signal of 51~Peg but we could not soundly detect the
reflected spectrum of 51~Peg\,b mainly due to the insufficient $SNR$ of the
input composite spectra. Nevertheless, our results show that with ""ad-hoc""

Here, we utilize a new experimental setup for the UHV-compatible dosing of
liquids to explore the stability of the Fe3O4(001)-c(2x2) surface following
exposure to liquid and ambient pressure water. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) data show that extensive
hydroxylation causes the surface to revert to a bulk-like (1x1) termination.
However, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) images reveal a more complex
situation, with the slow growth of an oxyhydroxide phase, which ultimately
saturates at approximately 40% coverage. We conclude that the new material
contains OH groups from dissociated water coordinated to Fe cations extracted
from subsurface layers, and that the surface passivates once the surface oxygen
lattice is saturated with H because no further dissociation can take place. The
resemblance of the STM images to those acquired in previous electrochemical STM
(EC-STM) studies lead us to believe a similar structure exists at the
solid-electrolyte interface during immersion at pH 7.

route towards this goal. In this study, we evaluate three different
state-of-the-art feature selection methods: Infinite Latent Feature Selection

recently proposed feature selection method named `Active Feature Selection'

it particularly sensitive to small perturbations. We investigate through

extended islands in field-driven magnetisation processes in pinwheel arrays,

reduction gives rise to anisotropies and array-corner mediated avalanche
reversals through a cascade of nearest-neighbour (NN) islands. The symmetries
of the anisotropy axes are related to those of the geometrical array but are
misaligned to the array axes as a result of the correlated interactions between
neighbouring islands. The NN dipolar coupling is reduced by decreasing the
island size and, using this property, we track the transition from the strongly
coupled regime towards the pure point dipole one and observe modification of
the ferromagnetic array reversal process. Our results shed light on important

breaking down consensus protocols and transaction validation processes, we
clarify that such existing approaches are either impractical or highly

describes the spin degree of freedom by the equations similar to the
Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert theory for bipartite antiferromagnetic insulator. The
variables in the spin space are two subspins with absolute value $\hbar/2$,
which play the role of two sublattice spins in the antiferromagnetic
insulators. As well as in bipartite antiferromagnetic insulators, in the
antiferromagnetic spin-1 BEC there are two spin-wave modes, one is a gapless
Goldstone mode, another is gapped. The Landau criterion shows that in limit of
small total spin (two subspins are nearly antiparallel) instability of
supercurrents starts from the gapped mode. In the opposite limit of large total
spin (two subspins are nearly parallel) the gapless modes become unstable
earlier than the gapped one. Mass and spin supercurrents decay via phase slips,
when vortices cross streamlines of supercurrent. The vortices participating in
phase slips are nonsingular bicirculation vortices. They are characterized by
two topological charges, which are winding numbers describing circulations of
two angles around the vortex axis. The winding numbers can be half-integer. A
particular example of a half-integer vortex is a half-quantum vortex with the
superfluid velocity circulation $h/2m$. But the superfluid velocity circulation
is not a topological charge, and in general the quantum of this circulation can

suggests that the merger rate of such events is large, and the sum of their GWs
can be viewed as stochastic signals. Because of its random nature,
cross-correlating the signals from multiple detectors is essential to
disentangle the GWs from instrumental noise. However, the global magnetic
fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity produce the environmental disturbances at
low-frequency bands, known as Schumann resonances, and coupled with GW
detectors, they potentially contaminate the stochastic GW signal as a
correlated noise. Previously, we have presented a simple analytical model to
estimate its impact on the detection of stochastic GWs. Here, extending the
analysis to further take account of the effects of anisotropic lightning source
distributions, we present a comprehensive study of the impact of correlated
magnetic noise at low-frequency bands, including non-tensor-type GWs, as well
as circularly polarized tensor-type GWs. We find that as opposed to a naive
expectation, the impact of correlated magnetic noise does not always increase
with anisotropies in the lighting source distribution. Even in the presence of
large anisotropies, there is a robust detector pair for which the amplitude of
correlated magnetic noise becomes comparable to or well below detectable
amplitude of stochastic GWs. The results indicate that the properties of the
correlated magnetic noise depend crucially on both the geometrical and
geographical setup of the detector's pair, and Virgo and KAGRA would be
potentially the most insensitive detector pair against the correlated magnetic

pattern is a feature known to depend on the size of the Galactic mask. Not only
the large scale anisotropy power in the CMB is lower than the best-fit
$\Lambda$CDM model predicts, but most of the power seems to be localised close
to the Galactic plane, making high-Galactic latitude regions more anomalous. We
assess how likely the latter behaviour is in a $\Lambda$CDM model by extracting
simulations from the {\it Planck} 2018 fiducial model. By comparing the former
to {\it Planck} data in different Galactic masks, we reproduce the anomaly
found in previous works, at a statistical significance of $\sim 3 \, \sigma$.
This result suggests the existence of a bizzarre correlation between the
particular orientation of the Galaxy and the lack of power anomaly. To test
this hypothesis, we perform random rotations of the {\it Planck} 2018 data and
compare these to similarly rotated $\Lambda$CDM realisations. We find that,
among all possible rotations, the lower-tail probability of the observed
high-Galactic latitude data variance is still low at the level of $2.8 \,
\sigma$. Furthermore, the lowering trend of the variance when moving from low-
to high-Galactic latitude is anomalous in the data at $\sim 3\,\sigma$ when
comparing to $\Lambda$CDM rotated realisations. This shows that the lack of
power at high Galactic latitude is substantially stable against the ""look
elsewhere"" effect induced by random rotations of the Galaxy orientation.
Moreover, this analysis turns out to be substantially stable if we employ, in
place of generic $\Lambda$CDM simulations, a specific set whose variance is
constrained to reproduce the observed data variance.

the need for such annotated datasets for end-to-end learning, and instead rely
on object proposals and a model for blur generation in order to produce a

self-supervised learning over the generated image and ground truth blur mask
pairs using CNNs, defining a framework that can be employed in purely
self-supervised, weakly supervised or semi-supervised configurations.
Interestingly, experimental results of such setups over the largest blur

transmission and dispersion properties of periodic acoustic metamaterials,
characterized by the presence of local resonators. Within this context,
particular attention has been paid to the optimization of the amplitudes and
center frequencies of selected stop and pass bands inside the Floquet-Bloch
spectra of the acoustic metamaterials featured by a chiral or antichiral
microstructure. Novel functional applications of such research are expected in
the optimal parametric design of smart tunable mechanical filters and
directional waveguides. The present paper deals with the maximization of the
amplitude of low-frequency band gaps, by proposing suitable numerical
techniques to solve the associated optimization problems. Specifically, the
feasibility and effectiveness of Radial Basis Function networks and Quasi-Monte
Carlo methods for the interpolation of the objective functions of such
optimization problems are discussed, and their numerical application to a
specific acoustic metamaterial with tetrachiral microstructure is presented.
The discussion is motivated theoretically by the high computational effort
often needed for an exact evaluation of the objective functions arising in band
gap optimization problems, when iterative algorithms are used for their
approximate solution. By replacing such functions with suitable surrogate
objective functions constructed applying machine-learning techniques, well
performing suboptimal solutions can be obtained with a smaller computational
effort. Numerical results demonstrate the effective potential of the proposed
approach. Current directions of research involving the use of additional
machine-learning techniques are also presented.

of accretion discs around young low-mass stellar and substellar objects (YSOs).
We revisit the case of MYLup, an object where VLT/X-Shooter data suggested a
negligible mass accretion rate, and show it to be accreting on a level similar
to other ClassII YSOs in Lupus based on HST observations. In our HST-COS and
-STIS spectra, we find many emission lines, as well as substantial FUV
continuum excess emission, which can be ascribed to active accretion. The total
luminosity of the CIV 1549A doublet is 4.1$\times10^{-4}$ Lsun. Using scalings
between accretion luminosity, Lacc, and CIV luminosity from the literature, we
derive Lacc $\sim$2$\times10^{-1}$ Lsun, which is more than an order of
magnitude higher than the upper limit estimated from the X-Shooter
observations. We discuss possible reasons for the X-Shooter-HST discrepancy,
the most plausible being that the low contrast between the continuum excess
emission and the photospheric+chromospheric emission at optical wavelengths in
MYLup hampered detection of excess emission. The luminosity of the FUV
continuum and CIV lines, strong H$_{2}$ fluorescence, and a ""1600 A Bump"" place
MYLup in the class of accreting objects with gas-rich discs. So far, MYLup is
the only peculiar case in which a significant difference between the HST and
X-Shooter Macc estimates exists that is not ascribable to variability. The mass
accretion rate inferred from the revisited Lacc estimate is Macc $\sim$ 1(
$^{+1.5}_{-0.5}$ )$\times10^{-8}$ Msun/yr. This value is consistent with the
typical value derived for accreting YSOs of similar mass in Lupus and points to
less clearing of the inner disc than indicated by near- and mid-infrared
observations. This is confirmed by ALMA data, which show that the gaps and
rings seen in the sub-millimetre are relatively shallow.

a beam of light. Single foragers move with constant speed due to some
propulsive mechanism. They explore at random loops the space around and return
rhytmically to their home. In the ensemble, the direction of the velocity of a
searcher is aligned to the motion of its neighbors. At first, we perform
simulations of this ensemble and find a cooperative behavior of the entities.
Above an over-critical interaction strength the trajectories of the searcher
qualitatively changes and searchers start to move along circles around the home
position. Thereby, all searchers rotate either clockwise or anticlockwise
around the central home position as it was reported for the zooplankton
Daphnia. At second, the computational findings are analytically explained by
the formulation of transport equations outgoing from the nonlinear mean field
Fokker-Planck equation of the considered situation. In the asymptotic
stationary limit, we find expressions for the critical interaction strength,
the mean radial and orbital velocities of the searchers and their velocity
variances. We also obtain the marginal spatial and angular densities in the
under-critical regime where the foragers behave like individuals as well as in
the over-critical regime where they rotate collectively around the considered
home. We additionally elaborate the overdamped Smoluchowski-limit for the

usually be disregarded for main-sequence stars, as the stellar contributions
average out when phase-folding the light curve. For evolved stars, however, the
amplitudes of such signals are larger and the timescales similar to the transit
duration of short-period planets, requiring that they be modeled alongside the
transit. With the promise of TESS delivering on the order of $\sim\!10^5$ light
curves for stars along the red-giant branch, there is a need for a method
capable of describing the ""stellar noise"" while simultaneously modelling an
exoplanet's transit. In this work, a Gaussian Process regression framework is
used to model stellar light curves and the method validated by applying it to
TESS-like artificial data. Furthermore, the method is used to characterize the
stellar oscillations and granulation of a sample of well-studied
\textit{Kepler} low-luminosity red-giant branch stars. The parameters
determined are compared to equivalent ones obtained by modelling the power
spectrum of the light curve. Results show that the method presented is capable
of describing the stellar signals in the time domain and can also return an
accurate and precise measurement of $\nu_\text{max}$, i.e., the frequency of
maximum oscillation amplitude. Preliminary results show that using the method
in transit modelling improves the precision and accuracy of the ratio between
the planetary and stellar radius, $R_p/R_\star$. The method's implementation is

knowledge, this is the first instance of a dimensionally adaptive sparse

motivating application behind this work is the adaptive approximation of a
multi-input model for a molecular potential energy surface (PES) where each
input represents an angle of rotation. Our method is based on an anisotropic
quasi-optimal estimate for the decay rate of the Fourier coefficients of the
model; a least-squares fit to the coefficients of the interpolant is used to
estimate the anisotropy. Thus, our adaptive approximation strategy begins with
a coarse isotropic interpolant, which is gradually refined using the estimated
anisotropic rates. The procedure takes several iterations where ever-more
accurate interpolants are used to generate ever-improving anisotropy rates. We
present several numerical examples of our algorithm where the adaptive
procedure successfully recovers the theoretical ""best"" convergence rate,
including an application to a periodic PES approximation. An open-source

science. Simple adiabatic models are inconsistent with the measured luminosity,
which indicates that Uranus is non-adiabatic because it has thermal boundary
layers and/or conductive regions. A gradual composition distribution acts as a
thermal boundary to suppress convection and slow down the internal cooling.
Here we investigate whether composition gradients in the deep interior of
Uranus can explain its low luminosity, the required composition gradient, and
whether it is stable for convective mixing on a timescale of some billion
years. We varied the primordial composition distribution and the initial energy
budget of the planet, and chose the models that fit the currently measured
properties (radius, luminosity, and moment of inertia) of Uranus. We present
several alternative non-adiabatic internal structures that fit the Uranus
measurements. We found that convective mixing is limited to the interior of
Uranus, and a composition gradient is stable and sufficient to explain its
current luminosity. As a result, the interior of Uranus might still be very
hot, in spite of its low luminosity. The stable composition gradient also
indicates that the current internal structure of Uranus is similar to its
primordial structure. Moreover, we suggest that the initial energy content of
Uranus cannot be greater than 20% of its formation (accretion) energy. We also
find that an interior with a mixture of ice and rock, rather than separated ice
and rock shells, is consistent with measurements, suggesting that Uranus might
not be ""differentiated"". Our models can explain the luminosity of Uranus, and
they are also consistent with its metal-rich atmosphere and with the
predictions for the location where its magnetic field is generated.

(TMDs) are model systems for investigations of strong light-matter interactions
and applications in nanophotonics, opto-electronics and valley-tronics.
However, the photoluminescence spectra of TMD monolayers display a large number
of features that are particularly challenging to decipher. On a practical
level, monochromatic TMD-based emitters would be beneficial for low-dimensional
devices but this challenge is yet to be resolved. Here, we show that graphene,
directly stacked onto TMD monolayers enables single and narrow-line
photoluminescence arising solely from TMD neutral excitons. This filtering
effect stems from complete neutralization of the TMD by graphene combined with
selective non-radiative transfer of long-lived excitonic species to graphene.
Our approach is applied to four tungsten and molybdenum-based TMDs and
establishes TMD/graphene heterostructures as a unique set of opto-electronic
building blocks, suitable for electroluminescent systems emitting visible and
near-infrared photons at near THz rate with linewidths approaching the lifetime
limit.

We demonstrate the ability to accurately determine pattern centers of simulated
patterns, inclusive of effects of binning and noise on the error of the fitted

While previous work focus on the design of new algorithms or are tailored for

learning process is often missed. In this work, we address this important issue
of initialization for network embedding that could dramatically improve the
performance of the algorithms on both effectiveness and efficiency.
Specifically, we first exploit the graph partition technique that divides the
graph into several disjoint subsets, and then construct an abstract graph based
on the partitions. We obtain the initialization of the embedding for each node
in the graph by computing the network embedding on the abstract graph, which is
much smaller than the input graph, and then propagating the embedding among the
nodes in the input graph. With extensive experiments on various datasets, we
demonstrate that our initialization technique significantly improves the
performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms on the evaluations of link
prediction and node classification by up to 7.76% and 8.74% respectively.
Besides, we show that the technique of initialization reduces the running time

neutral atoms in the thermal energy range for laser cooling. The experiments
were carried out with yttrium, gadolinium, and zirconium foils to neutralize
francium and rubidium ions for magneto-optical trapping. The results reconfirm
that yttrium foil is a good neutralizer (i.e., it has a neutral release
efficiency $>65\%$). In addition, the release fraction when using yttrium foil
exceeds 75\% at 1350 K, which is greater than the release fraction for the
other foils. This reconfirmation is important because few previous studies have

at a short range $\lambda \sim 100$ nm. However, the vortex can induce a long
range Josephson phase shift at distances $r\sim\mu$m$\gg\lambda$. The mechanism
of this puzzling phenomenon is not clearly understood. Here we present a
systematic study of vortex-induced phase shift in planar Josephson junctions.
We make two key observations: (i) The cutoff effect: although vortex-induce
phase shift is a long-range phenomenon, it is terminated by the junction and
does not persists beyond it. (ii) A crossover from linear to superlinear
dependence of the phase shift on the vortex polar angle occurs upon approaching
of the vortex to the junction. The crossover occurs at a distance comparable
with the penetration depth. This, together with theoretical and numerical
analysis of the problem, allows unambiguous identification of two distinct and
independent mechanisms. The short range mechanism is due to circulating vortex
currents {\it inside} superconducting electrodes without involvement of
magnetic field. The long range mechanism is due to stray magnetic fields {\it
outside} electrodes without circulating vortex currents. We argue that
understanding of controlling parameters of vortex-induced Josephson phase shift
can be used for development of compact and fast electronic devices with low
dissipation power.

challenging task. Although substantial progress has been made in past years,
the explainability of existing methods is still limited. In this work, we
propose a novel action reasoning framework that uses prior knowledge to explain
semantic-level observations of video state changes. Our method takes advantage
of both classical reasoning and modern deep learning approaches. Specifically,
prior knowledge is defined as the information of a target video domain,
including a set of objects, attributes and relationships in the target video
domain, as well as relevant actions defined by the temporal attribute and
relationship changes (i.e. state transitions). Given a video sequence, we first
generate a scene graph on each frame to represent concerned objects, attributes
and relationships. Then those scene graphs are linked by tracking objects
across frames to form a spatio-temporal graph (also called video graph), which
represents semantic-level video states. Finally, by sequentially examining each
state transition in the video graph, our method can detect and explain how
those actions are executed with prior knowledge, just like the logical manner
of thinking by humans. Compared to previous works, the action reasoning results
of our method can be explained by both logical rules and semantic-level
observations of video content changes. Besides, the proposed method can be used
to detect multiple concurrent actions with detailed information, such as who
(particular objects), when (time), where (object locations) and how (what kind
of changes). Experiments on a re-annotated dataset CAD-120 show the
effectiveness of our method.

performance than handcrafted feature-based approaches. However, domain
adaptability of the existing learning-based pore detection methods has never

an in-house 1000 dpi fingerprint dataset with ground truth pore coordinates

gradient reversal layer between the CNN and a domain classifier network. The
proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in a cross-sensor

obtain in most social media websites, and it is hard to capture
attributes-aware words to connect similar people. Accordingly, we propose a
Neural Personal Discrimination (NPD) approach to address above challenges by
determining personal attributes from posts, and connecting relevant posts with
similar attributes to jointly learn their emotions. In particular, we employ
adversarial discriminators to determine the personal attributes, with attention
mechanisms to aggregate attributes-aware words. In this way, social
correlationship among different posts can be better addressed. Experimental
results show the usefulness of personal attributes, and the effectiveness of
our proposed NPD approach in capturing such personal attributes with

learning based reconstruction method combining model knowledge with a learned

reconstruction results over several iterations. The Learned SIRT algorithm is
applied to a cone beam geometry on a circular orbit, a challenging problem for
learned methods due to its 3D geometry and its inherent inability to completely
capture the patient anatomy. A comparison of 2D reconstructions is shown, where
the learned SIRT approach produces reconstructions with superior peak signal to
noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM), compared to FBP, SIRT and
U-net post-processing and similar PSNR and SSIM compared to the learned primal
dual algorithm. Similar results are shown for cone beam geometry
reconstructions of a 3D Shepp Logan phantom, where we obtain between 9.9 and
28.1 dB improvement over FBP with a substantial improvement in SSIM. Finally we
show that our algorithm scales to clinically relevant problems, and performs
well when applied to measurements of a physical phantom.

of video object segmentation (VOS) in real applications. With the advanced
techniques of deep neural networks, the accuracy has been significantly
improved, however, the speed is still far below the real-time needs because of
the complicated network design, such as the requirement of the first frame
fine-tuning step. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mask transfer
network (MTN), which can greatly boost the processing speed of VOS and also
achieve a reasonable accuracy. The basic idea of MTN is to transfer the
reference mask to the target frame via an efficient global pixel matching
strategy. The global pixel matching between the reference frame and the target
frame is to ensure good matching results. To enhance the matching speed, we
perform the matching on a downsampled feature map with 1/32 of the original
frame size. At the same time, to preserve the detailed mask information in such
a small feature map, a mask network is designed to encode the annotated mask
information with 512 channels. Finally, an efficient feature warping method is
used to transfer the encoded reference mask to the target frame. Based on this
design, our method avoids the fine-tuning step on the first frame and does not
rely on the temporal cues and particular object categories. Therefore, it runs
very fast and can be conveniently trained only with images, as well as being
robust to unseen objects. Experiments on the DAVIS datasets demonstrate that
MTN can achieve a speed of 37 fps, and also shows a competitive accuracy in
comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.

happen at very different nucleosynthetic sites. To study them in an environment
different from the Milky Way, we target these elements in RGB stars in the
Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Using ESO VLT/FLAMES spectra, we measure the
chemical abundances of Y, Ba, La, Nd, and Eu, in 98 stars covering
$-2.4<\text{[Fe/H]}<-0.9$. This is the first paper in a series about the
$n$-capture elements in dwarf galaxies, and here we focus on the relative and
absolute timescales of the slow ($s$)- and rapid ($r$)-processes in Sculptor.
From the abundances of the $s$-process element Ba and the $r$-process element
Eu, it is clear that the $r$-process enrichment occurred throughout the entire
chemical evolution history of Sculptor. Furthermore, there is no evidence for
the $r$-process to have a significant time delay relative to core-collapse
supernovae. Neutron star mergers are therefore unlikely the dominant (or only)
nucleosynthetic site of the $r$-process. However, the products of the
$s$-process only become apparent at $\text{[Fe/H]}\approx-2$ in Sculptor, and
the $s$-process becomes the dominant source of Ba at $\text{[Fe/H]}\gtrsim-2$.
We test the use of [Y/Mg] and [Ba/Mg] as chemical clocks in Sculptor. Similarly
to what is observed in the Milky Way, [Y/Mg] and [Ba/Mg] increase towards
younger ages. However, there is an offset, where the abundance ratios of [Y/Mg]
in Sculptor are significantly lower than those of the Milky Way at any given
age. This is most likely caused by metallicity dependence of yields from the
$s$-process, as well as different relative contribution of the $s$-process to
core-collapse supernovae in these galaxies. Comparisons of our data with that
of the Milky Way and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy furthermore show that
these chemical clocks are both metallicity and environment dependent.

can be derived for the single IRS case and a near-optimal analytical solution
can be obtained for the multi-IRS case. Our analysis reveals that the received
signal power increases quadratically with the number of reflecting elements for
both the single IRS and multi-IRS cases. Simulation results are included to
verify the optimality and near-optimality of our proposed solutions. Results
also show that IRSs can help create effective virtual LOS paths and thus
substantially improve robustness against blockages in mmWave communications.

file systems directly in user level. Unfortunately, a userlevel file system can
easily be corrupted by a buggy program with misused pointers, and is hard to
scale on multi-core platforms which incorporates a centralized coordination
service. In this paper, we propose KucoFS, a Kernel and user-level
collaborative file system. It consists of two parts: a user-level library with
direct-access interfaces, and a kernel thread, which performs metadata updates
and enforces write protection by toggling the permission bits in the page
table. Hence, KucoFS achieves both direct-access of user-level designs and
fine-grained write protection of kernel-level ones. We further explore its
scalability to multicores: For metadata scalability, KucoFS rebalances the
pathname resolution overhead between the kernel and userspace, by adopting the
index offloading technique. For data access efficiency, it coordinates the data
allocation between kernel and userspace, and uses range-lock write and
lock-free read to improve concurrency. Experiments on Optane DC persistent

magnetopause, and readily reach very large amplitudes. Determining the
properties of lower hybrid waves is crucial because they are thought to
contribute to electron and ion heating, cross-field particle diffusion,
anomalous resistivity, and energy transfer between electrons and ions. All
these processes could play an important role in magnetic reconnection at the
magnetopause and the evolution of the boundary layer. In this paper, the
properties of lower hybrid waves at Earth's magnetopause are investigated using
the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. For the first time, the properties
of the waves are investigated using fields and direct particle measurements.
The highest-resolution electron moments resolve the velocity and density
fluctuations of lower hybrid waves, confirming that electrons remain
approximately frozen in at lower hybrid wave frequencies. Using fields and
particle moments the dispersion relation is constructed and the wave-normal
angle is estimated to be close to $90^{\circ}$ to the background magnetic
field. The waves are shown to have a finite parallel wave vector, suggesting
that they can interact with parallel propagating electrons. The observed wave
properties are shown to agree with theoretical predictions, the previously used
single-spacecraft method, and four-spacecraft timing analyses. These results
show that single-spacecraft methods can accurately determine lower hybrid wave
properties.

it does not take into account the correct angular parametrization of the sky,
i.e. the one determined by the observer frame. The corresponding corrections
must be taken into account for reliable results at non-linear orders. This can
be accomplished by introducing an orthonormal basis, or ""tetrad"", at the
observer point, representing the frame with respect to which observations are
performed. In this work we consider the tetrad formulation of General
Relativity, thus associating tetrads to sources as well, and develop a new
formalism for describing cosmological observables associated with localized
sources. It is based on a manifold which we call the ""observer space-time"",
whose coordinates are the proper time, redshift and angles an observer uses to
parametrize measurements, and on which the rest of the observables are defined.
This manifold does not have to be diffeomorphic to the true space-time and
allows us to resolve caustics in the latter, in contrast to similar
coordinate-based formalisms. As a concrete example, we work out the definitions
and equations for the angular diameter distance, weak lensing and number count
observables. As for the observables associated to the CMB, they lie inside the
phase space distribution of the photon fluid, so we also revisit the
construction of general-relativistic matrix kinetic theory from the tetrad
formalism viewpoint. Here too the latter appears as the natural approach for
relating the macroscopic dynamics to the microscopic quantum field theory, and
therefore for constructing the matrix Boltzmann equations, without any
approximation on the gravitational side. (... more in the manuscript)

learning dataset bias: superficial cues that happen to associate with the label

indicate contradiction. As exposed by several recent challenge datasets, these
models perform poorly when such association is absent, e.g., predicting that ""I
love dogs"" contradicts ""I don't love cats"". Our goal is to design learning
algorithms that guard against known dataset bias. We formalize the concept of
dataset bias under the framework of distribution shift and present a simple
debiasing algorithm based on residual fitting, which we call DRiFt. We first
learn a biased model that only uses features that are known to relate to
dataset bias. Then, we train a debiased model that fits to the residual of the
biased model, focusing on examples that cannot be predicted well by biased
features only. We use DRiFt to train three high-performing NLI models on two
benchmark datasets, SNLI and MNLI. Our debiased models achieve significant

emission from the system is modulated at a period of 13.7135 +/- 0.0019 days,
with the presence of two maxima per orbit with different spectral properties.
X-ray observations using the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope
(XRT) show that X-ray emission is also modulated at this period, but with a
single maximum that is closer to the secondary lower-energy gamma-ray maximum.
A radio source, coincident with the X-ray source, is also found from Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations, and the radio emission is
modulated on the gamma-ray period with similar phasing to the X-ray emission. A
large degree of interstellar obscuration severely hampers optical observations,
but a near-infrared counterpart is found. Near-infrared spectroscopy indicates
an O6 III spectral classification. This is the third gamma-ray binary to be
discovered with the Fermi LAT from periodic modulation of the gamma-ray

counterparts. We consider at what distances we can detect such modulated
gamma-ray emission with the LAT, and examine constraints on the gamma-ray

science case and some implementation issues of a space-borne radio
interferometric system for ultra-sharp imaging of celestial radio sources at
the level of angular resolution down to (sub-) microarcseconds. THEZA focuses
at millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths (frequencies above $\sim$300~GHz),
but allows for science operations at longer wavelengths too. The THEZA concept
science rationale is focused on the physics of spacetime in the vicinity of
supermassive black holes as the leading science driver. The main aim of the
concept is to facilitate a major leap by providing researchers with orders of
magnitude improvements in the resolution and dynamic range in direct imaging
studies of the most exotic objects in the Universe, black holes. The concept
will open up a sizeable range of hitherto unreachable parameters of
observational astrophysics. It unifies two major lines of development of
space-borne radio astronomy of the past decades: Space VLBI (Very Long Baseline
Interferometry) and mm- and sub-mm astrophysical studies with ""single dish""
instruments. It also builds upon the recent success of the Earth-based Event
Horizon Telescope (EHT) -- the first-ever direct image of a shadow of the
super-massive black hole in the centre of the galaxy M87. As an amalgam of
these three major areas of modern observational astrophysics, THEZA aims at
facilitating a breakthrough in high-resolution high image quality studies in
the millimetre and sub-millimetre domain of the electromagnetic spectrum.

simultaneous anatomical imaging and real-time (SMART) passive device tracking
for MR-guided interventions.
  Methods: Phase Correlation template matching was combined with a fast
undersampled radial multi-echo acquisition using the white marker phenomenon
after the first echo. In this way, the first echo provides anatomical contrast,
whereas the other echoes provide white marker contrast to allow accurate device
localization using fast simulations and template matching. This approach was
tested on tracking of five 0.5 mm steel markers in an agarose phantom and on
insertion of an MRI-compatible 20 Gauge titanium needle in ex vivo porcine
tissue. The locations of the steel markers were quantitatively compared to the
marker locations as found on a CT scan of the same phantom.
  Results: The average pairwise error between the MRI and CT locations was 0.30
mm for tracking of stationary steel spheres and 0.29 mm during motion.
Qualitative evaluation of the tracking of needle insertions showed that tracked
positions were stable throughout needle insertion and retraction.
  Conclusions: The proposed SMART tracking method provided accurate passive
tracking of devices at high framerates, inclusion of real-time anatomical
scanning, and the capability of automatic slice positioning. Furthermore, the
method does not require specialized hardware and could therefore be applied to
track any rigid metal device that causes appreciable magnetic field
distortions.

detecting language processing in patients with Disorders of Consciousness, and
(3) using semantic stimuli to probe what is on a user's mind. Drawing on

seems intuitive, stationary dynamics are also possible in asymmetric open

In contrast to similar concepts, symmetrisation allows for the description of
physical multi-well potentials with gain and loss. A simple matrix model for

analytical symmetrised solutions are derived. It is explicitly shown how
symmetrisation can be used to systematically find two-mode systems with a

as quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs). Both models address the same hard
tasks in unsupervised generative modeling, with QCBMs exploiting the
probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and a candidate for near-term quantum
computers, as experimentally demonstrated in three different quantum hardware

quantum model on real-world classical data sets, we construct scenarios from a
probabilistic version out of the well-known portfolio optimization problem in

resources in terms of parameters for both classical and quantum models, the
quantum models seem to have superior performance on typical instances when

systems with desired behaviors. To this end, molecular controllers have been
developed which, when embedded into a pre-existing ambient biochemical network,
control the dynamics of the underlying target molecular species. When
integrated into smaller compartments, such as biological cells in vivo, or
vesicles in vitro, controllers have to be calibrated to factor in the intrinsic
noise. In this context, molecular controllers put forward in the literature
have focused on manipulating the mean (first moment), and reducing the variance
(second moment), of the target species. However, many critical biochemical
processes are realized via higher-order moments, particularly the number and
configuration of the modes (maxima) of the probability distributions. To bridge
the gap, a controller called stochastic morpher is put forward in this paper,
inspired by gene-regulatory networks, which, under suitable time-scale
separations, morphs the probability distribution of the target species into a
desired predefined form. The morphing can be performed at the lower-resolution,
allowing one to achieve desired multi-modality/multi-stability, and at the
higher-resolution, allowing one to achieve arbitrary probability distributions.
Properties of the controller, such as robust perfect adaptation and
convergence, are rigorously established, and demonstrated on various examples.
Also proposed is a blueprint for an experimental implementation of stochastic
morpher.

together, and mining pools are in high competition. This has led to the
development of several attack strategies such as block withholding (BWH) and
fork after withholding (FAW) attacks that can weaken the health of PoW systems
and but maximize mining pools' profits. In this paper, we present strategies
called Adaptive Retaliation Strategies (ARS) to mitigate not only BWH attacks

normal situation, and adaptively executes either FAW or BWH attacks for the
purpose of retaliation only when attacked. In addition, in order for rational
pools to adopt ARS, ARS should strike to an adaptive balance between

reaction for selective hydrogen production. This clean fuel is a sustainable
energy source. Because electron transfer is the key to such reactions, accurate
methods based on quantum theory are used. The reaction between water and carbon
monoxide has been used industrially with metal catalysts, usually Platinum.
There is a considerable economic and environmental challenge underpinning this
application of a fundamental process limited by bond dissociation. That is the
process often limiting reaction rates for industrial catalysis. Most mainstream
quantum approaches fail to greater or lesser degree in the description of bond
dissociation. The present work presents a promising alternative: the initial
analysis of a considerable mass of statistical data generated by the
atomic-scale Quantum Monte Carlo method to very stringent statistical accuracy
for essential information on the hydrogen production via the water-gas shift
reaction with platinum catalyst.
  This is encouraging for establishing less well-known benchmark values of
industrial reaction barriers on Pt(111).

the open-strict or opaque-adaptive categories. Our contribution takes steps in
the open-adaptive direction, which we suggest is likely to provide key
instruments for interdisciplinary research. The central idea of our approach is
the Semantic Hypergraph (SH), a novel knowledge representation model that is
intrinsically recursive and accommodates the natural hierarchical richness of
natural language. The SH model is hybrid in two senses. First, it attempts to
combine the strengths of ML and symbolic approaches. Second, it is a formal
language representation that reduces but tolerates ambiguity and structural
variability. We will see that SH enables simple yet powerful methods of pattern
detection, and features a good compromise for intelligibility both for humans
and machines. It also provides a semantically deep starting point (in terms of
explicit meaning) for further algorithms to operate and collaborate on. We show
how modern NLP ML-based building blocks can be used in combination with a
random forest classifier and a simple search tree to parse NL to SH, and that
this parser can achieve high precision in a diversity of text categories. We
define a pattern language representable in SH itself, and a process to discover
knowledge inference rules. We then illustrate the efficiency of the SH
framework in a variety of tasks, including conjunction decomposition, open
information extraction, concept taxonomy inference and co-reference resolution,

transformation to the time-cone of the strain wave, the Dirac equation is
reduced to an ordinary second-order differential Matthieu equation, i.e., to a
parametric pendulum, giving a spectrum of bands and gaps determined by
resonance conditions between the electron and ripple wave-vector (G), and their
incidence angles. The location of the nth gap is thus determined by $E\approx n
v_{F}\hbar G$, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity. Physically, gaps are produced
by diffraction of electrons in phase with the wave. The propagation is mainly
in the direction of the ripple. In the case of a pure pseudoelectric field and

threat, and modeling the behavior of such diseases is a key component of their
control. Many emerging zoonoses, such as SARS, Nipah, and Hendra, mutated from
their wild type while circulating in an intermediate host population, usually a
domestic species, to become more transmissible among humans, and moreover, this
transmission route will only become more likely as agriculture and trade
intensifies around the world. Passage through an intermediate host enables many
otherwise rare diseases to become better adapted to humans, and so
understanding this process with mathematical epidemiological models is
necessary to prevent epidemics of emerging zoonoses, guide policy interventions
in public health, and predict the behavior of an epidemic. In this paper, we
account for spillovers of a zoonotic disease mutating in an intermediate host
by means of modeling transmission dynamics within and between three host
species, namely, wild reservoir, intermediate domestic animals, and humans. We
calculate the basic reproductive number of the pathogen, present critical
conditions for the emergence dynamics of zoonosis, and perform stability
analysis of admissible disease equilibria. Our analytical results agree well
with long-term simulations of the system. We find that in the presence of
biologically realistic interspecies transmission parameters, a zoonotic disease
can establish itself in humans even if it fails to persist in its reservoir and
intermediate host species. Our model and results can be used to understand the
dynamic behavior of any zoonosis with intermediate hosts and assist efforts to

grains coupled to the gas via drag forces is the subject of this work. The
proposed particle-gas hybrid scheme has been designed to work in Cartesian as
well as in cylindrical and spherical geometries. The numerical method relies on
a Godunov-type second-order scheme for the fluid and an exponential midpoint
rule for dust particles which overcomes the stiffness introduced by the linear
coupling term. Besides being time-reversible and globally second-order accurate
in time, the exponential integrator provides energy errors which are always
bounded and it remains stable in the limit of arbitrarily small particle
stopping times yielding the correct asymptotic solution. Such properties make
this method preferable to the more widely used semi-implicit or fully implicit
schemes at a very modest increase in computational cost. Coupling between
particles and grid quantities is achieved through particle deposition and
field-weighting techniques borrowed from Particle-In-Cell simulation methods.
In this respect, we derive new weight factors in curvilinear coordinates that
are more accurate than traditional volume- or area-weighting.
  A comprehensive suite of numerical benchmarks is presented to assess the
accuracy and robustness of the algorithm in Cartesian, cylindrical and
spherical coordinates. Particular attention is devoted to the streaming
instability which is analyzed in both local and global disk models. The module
is part of the PLUTO code for astrophysical gas-dynamics and it is mainly
intended for the numerical modeling of protoplanetary disks in which solid and

equation in layered media. The potential due to charges embedded in layered
media is decomposed into a free space component and four types of reaction
field components, and the latter can be associated with the potential of a
polarization source defined for each type. New multipole expansions (MEs) and
local expansions (LEs), as well as the multipole to local (M2L) translation
operators are derived for the reaction components, based on which the FMMs for
reaction components are then proposed. The resulting FMM for charge
interactions in layered media is a combination of using the classic FMM for the
free space components and the new FMMs for the reaction field components. With
the help of a recurrence formula for the run-time computation of the
Sommerfeld-type integrals used in M2L translation operators, pre-computations
of a large number of tables are avoided. The new FMMs for the reaction
components are found to be much faster than the classic FMM for the free space
components due to the separation of equivalent polarization charges and the
associated target charges by a material interface. As a result, the FMM for
potential in layered media costs almost the same as the classic FMM in the free
space case. Numerical results validate the fast convergence of the MEs for the
reaction components, and the O(N) complexity of the FMM with a given truncation
number p for charge interactions in 3-D layered media.

different time scales and 2) By construction, this variable time series
contains practically the same number of non-negative and negative entry values.
We also show that these time multi-scale returns display distributional
bi-modality. Daily financial indices analyzed in this work, are the Mexican
IPC, the American DJIA, DAX from Germany and the Japanese Market index Nikkei,
covering a time period from 11-08-1991 to 06-30-2017. We show that, at the time
scale resolution and significance considered in this paper, it is almost always
feasible to find an interval of possible symmetry points containing one most
plausible symmetry point denoted by C. Finally, we study the temporal evolution
of C showing that this point is seldom zero and responds with sensitivity to
extreme market events.

conventional CS algorithms. However, for existing network based approaches, a
CS sampling procedure has to map a separate network model. This may potentially
degrade the performance of image CS with block-wise sampling because of
blocking artifacts, especially when multiple sampling rates are assigned to
different blocks within an image. In this paper, we develop a multichannel deep
network for block-based image CS by exploiting inter-block correlation with
performance significantly exceeding the current state-of-the-art methods. The
significant performance improvement is attributed to block-wise approximation
but full image removal of blocking artifacts. Specifically, with our
multichannel structure, the image blocks with a variety of sampling rates can
be reconstructed in a single model. The initially reconstructed blocks are then
capable of being reassembled into a full image to improve the recovered images
by unrolling a hand-designed block based CS recovery algorithm. Experimental

for diamond-structured covalent materials is constructed on the basis of the
dislocation theory. Our results show that, at low temperature, the Vickers
hardness is mainly controlled by Poisson's ratio and shear modulus with the
latter playing a dominant role. With increasing temperature, the plastic
deformation mechanism undergoes a transition from shuffle-set dislocation
control to glide-set dislocation control, leading to a steeper drop of hardness
at high temperature. In addition, an intrinsic parameter, a3G, is revealed for
diamond-structured covalent materials, which measures the resistance to soften
at high temperature. Our hardness model shows remarkable agreement with
experimental data. Current work not only sheds lights on the physical origin of
hardness, but also provides a direct principle for superhard materials design.

neuro-oncology, in particular for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response
monitoring.
  Materials and Methods: The PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched for
articles published before September 2018 using relevant search terms. The
search strategy focused on articles applying ML to high-grade glioma biomarkers
for treatment response monitoring, prognosis, and prediction.
  Results: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically used throughout the
patient pathway because routine structural imaging provides detailed anatomical
and pathological information and advanced techniques provide additional
physiological detail. Using carefully chosen image features, ML is frequently
used to allow accurate classification in a variety of scenarios. Rather than
being chosen by human selection, ML also enables image features to be
identified by an algorithm. Much research is applied to determining molecular
profiles, histological tumour grade, and prognosis using MRI images acquired at
the time that patients first present with a brain tumour. Differentiating a
treatment response from a post-treatment-related effect using imaging is
clinically important and also an area of active study (described here in one of
two Special Issue publications dedicated to the application of ML in glioma
imaging).
  Conclusion: Although pioneering, most of the evidence is of a low level,
having been obtained retrospectively and in single centres. Studies applying ML
to build neuro-oncology monitoring biomarker models have yet to show an overall
advantage over those using traditional statistical methods. Development and
validation of ML models applied to neuro-oncology require large, well-annotated
datasets, and therefore multidisciplinary and multi-centre collaborations are
necessary.
