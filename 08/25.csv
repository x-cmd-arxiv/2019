(1+1)-dimensional Lifshitz effective action can be derived from a
(2+1)-dimensional non-relativistic Schr$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$dinger-invariant
Chern-Simons (NRSCS) action which was shown to be equivalent to a specific
Weyl-invariant non-projectable Horava-Lifshitz action of gravity. On a manifold
with a boundary, we will show that the (1+1)-dimensional Lifshitz Weyl anomaly
can be derived from a specific term, the torsional CS (tCS) term, in the NRSCS
action built from the gauge fields of the Weyl and special conformal symmetry
generators of the centrally-extended Schr$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$dinger algebra. We
also focus on the $z=1$ Lifshitz Weyl anomaly and attempt to elicit its
geometric and physical nature, in particular its relationship with the Lorentz
anomaly of a (1+1)-dimensional CFT effective actions. We show that it is
directly related to the curvature scalar of the dual Lorentz connection, the
integral of which is known to be a topological invariant. We also point out
that making the anomalous Lifshitz quantum effective action Weyl-invariant
amounts to obtaining the equation of motion for a stationary chiral boson which
happens to be the spatial-component of the acceleration vector. By putting
boundary conditions on the spatial slices, the time dependence of the lapse
function in the Arnowitt, Deser and Misner (ADM) decomposition is eliminated
and the result is a Rindler metric. We finally discuss several issues related
to the (1+1)-dimensional Lifshitz Weyl anomaly regarding edge physics of
fractional quantum Hall states and anomaly cancellation by anomaly inflow.

whose cores are enforced to rotate at rates consistent with asteroseismology
observations of their progenitors and successors. Methods. We calculated new
2M$_{\odot}$, Z=0.01 models, rotating at 0, 125, and 250 km/s at the start of
main sequence. An artificial, additional viscosity was added to enhance the
transport of angular momentum in order to reduce the core rotation rates to be
in agreement with asteroseismology observations. We compared rotation rates of
our models with observed rotation rates during the MS up to the end of core He
burning, and the white dwarf phase. Results. We present nucleosynthesis
calculations for these rotating AGB models that were enforced to match the
asteroseismic constraints on rotation rates of MS, RGB, He-burning, and WD
stars. In particular, we calculated one model that matches the upper limit of
observed rotation rates of core He-burning stars and we also included a model
that rotates one order of magnitude faster than the upper limit of the
observations. The s-process production in both of these models is comparable to
that of non-rotating models. Conclusions. Slowing down the core rotation rate
in stars to match the above mentioned asteroseismic constraints reduces the
rotationally induced mixing processes to the point that they have no effect on
the s-process nucleosynthesis. This result is independent of the initial
rotation rate of the stellar evolution model. However, there are uncertainties
remaining in the treatment of rotation in stellar evolution, which need to be
reduced in order to confirm our conclusions, including the physical nature of
our approach to reduce the core rotation rates of our models, and magnetic
processes.

and secret key in any cryptosystem, and is the only nonlinear component in many
block ciphers. Dynamic s-boxes, as compared to static, improve entropy of the
system, hence leading to better resistance against linear and differential
attacks. It was shown in [2] that while incorporating dynamic s-boxes in
cryptosystems is sufficiently secure, they do not keep non-linearity invariant.
This work provides an algorithmic scheme to generate key-dependent dynamic
$n\times n$ clone s-boxes having the same algebraic properties namely
bijection, nonlinearity, the strict avalanche criterion (SAC), the output bits
independence criterion (BIC) as of the initial seed s-box. The method is based
on group action of symmetric group $S_n$ and a subgroup $S_{2^n}$ respectively
on columns and rows of Boolean functions ($GF(2^n)\to GF(2)$) of s-box.
Invariance of the bijection, nonlinearity, SAC, and BIC for the generated clone
copies is proved. As illustration, examples are provided for $n=8$ and $n=4$
along with comparison of the algebraic properties of the clone and initial seed
s-box. The proposed method is an extension of [3,4,5,6] which involved group
action of $S_8$ only on columns of Boolean functions ($GF(2^8)\to GF(2)$ ) of
s-box. For $n=4$, we have used an initial $4\times 4$ s-box constructed by
Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares [7] to generated $(4!)^2$ clone copies. For
$n=8$, it can be seen [3,4,5,6] that the number of clone copies that can be
constructed by permuting the columns is $8!$. For each column permutation, the
proposed method enables to generate $8!$ clone copies by permuting the rows.

How","Planning Beyond the Sensing Horizon Using a Learned Context",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Last-mile delivery systems commonly propose the use of autonomous robotic
vehicles to increase scalability and efficiency. The economic inefficiency of
collecting accurate prior maps for navigation motivates the use of planning
algorithms that operate in unmapped environments. However, these algorithms
typically waste time exploring regions that are unlikely to contain the
delivery destination. Context is key information about structured environments
that could guide exploration toward the unknown goal location, but the abstract
idea is difficult to quantify for use in a planning algorithm. Some approaches
specifically consider contextual relationships between objects, but would
perform poorly in object-sparse environments like outdoors. Recent deep
learning-based approaches consider context too generally, making
training/transferability difficult. Therefore, this work proposes a novel
formulation of utilizing context for planning as an image-to-image translation
problem, which is shown to extract terrain context from semantic gridmaps, into
a metric that an exploration-based planner can use. The proposed framework has
the benefit of training on a static dataset instead of requiring a
time-consuming simulator. Across 42 test houses with layouts from satellite
images, the trained algorithm enables a robot to reach its goal 189\% faster
than with a context-unaware planner, and within 63\% of the optimal path
computed with a prior map. The proposed algorithm is also implemented on a

studied, it is not well understood how small flames interact with large-scale
turbulent flow motion. Since this question is of practical importance for the
occurrence of cycle-to-cycle variations in spark ignition engines, the
objective of the present work is to fundamentally differentiate early flame
kernel development from well-established turbulent flame configurations. For
this purpose, a DNS database consisting of three flames propagating in
homogeneous isotropic turbulence (Falkenstein et al., Combust. Flame, 2019) is
considered. The flames feature different ratios of the initially laminar flame
diameter to the integral length scale. To quantify flame kernel development,
the time evolution of flame topology and flame front geometry are analysed in
detail. It is shown that some realizations of the early flame kernel are
substantially influenced by high compressive strain caused by large-scale
turbulent flow motion with characteristic length scales greater than the flame
kernel size. As a result, the initial spherical kernel topology may become
highly distorted, which is reflected in the stochastic occurrence of excessive
curvature variance. Two mechanisms of curvature production resulting from early
flame kernel/turbulence interactions are identified by analysis of the mean
curvature balance equation. Further, it is shown that the curvature
distribution of small flame kernels becomes strongly skewed towards positive
curvatures, which is contrary to developed turbulent flames. Hence, the
transition of ignition kernels to self-sustaining turbulent flames is very
different in nature compared with the development of a statistically planar
flame brush.

covariant version of the calculus we construct representations of Poincare
group in terms of Weyl operators on suitably constructed, Bosonic or Fermionic

by describing the orbits of homogeneous Lorentz group on R4 and build fiber
bundle representations of Poincar\'e group induced from the stabilizer
subgroups (little groups) and build the Boson Fock space of the Hilbert space
formed from the sections of the bundle. Our Weyl operators are constructed on
symmetric Fock space of this space and the corresponding annihilation,
creation, and conservation operators are synthesized in the usual fashion in
relativistic theories for space-like, time-like, and light-like fields. We
achieve this by constructing transitive systems of imprimitivity
(second-quantized SI), which are dynamical systems with trajectories dense in
the configuration space, by induced representations. We provide the details of
the field operators for the case of massive Bosons as the rest are similar in
construction and indicate the ways to construct adapted processes paving way
for building covariant quantum stochastic calculus.

network, based on models of Datta et al. and Aslay et al. Multiple advertisers
are willing to pay the host - up to a known budget - per user exposure, whether
the exposure is sponsored or orgain (i.e. shared by a friend). Campaigns are
seeded with sponsored ads to some users, but no user must be exposed to too
many sponsored ads. Thus, while ad campaigns proceed independently over the
network, they need to be carefully coordinated with respect to their seed sets.
  We study the objective of maximizing host's total ad revenue. Our main result
is to show that under a broad class of influence models, the problem can be
reduced to maximizing a submodular function subject to two matroid constraints;
it can therefore be approximated within a factor essentially 1/2 in polynomial
time. When there is no bound on the individual seed set sizes of advertisers,
the constraints correspond only to a single matroid, and the guarantee can be
improved to 1-1/e; in that case, a factor 1/2 is achieved by a practical greedy
algorithm. The 1-1/e approximation algorithm for matroid-constrained problem is
far from practical; however, we show that specifically under the Independent
Cascade model, LP rounding and Reverse Reachability techniques can be combined
to obtain a 1-1/e approximation algorithm.
  Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments evaluating the extent
to which the coordination of multiple ad campaigns inhibits the revenue
obtained from each individual campaign, as a function of the similarity of the
influence networks and strength of ties in the networks. Our experiments
suggest that as networks for different advertisers become less similar, the
harmful effect of competition decreases. With respect to tie strengths, we show
that the most harm is done in an intermediate range.

moving into the focus of computer vision as a rich representation of everyday
scenes. However, they are hard to handle for machine learning algorithms due to
their unordered structure. One common approach is to apply occupancy grid
mapping, which dramatically increases the amount of data stored and at the same
time loses details through discretization. Recently, deep learning models were
proposed to handle point clouds directly and achieve input permutation
invariance. However, these architectures often use an increased number of
parameters and are computationally inefficient. In this work, we propose basis
point sets (BPS) as a highly efficient and fully general way to process point
clouds with machine learning algorithms. The basis point set representation is
a residual representation that can be computed efficiently and can be used with
standard neural network architectures and other machine learning algorithms.
Using the proposed representation as the input to a simple fully connected
network allows us to match the performance of PointNet on a shape
classification task while using three orders of magnitude less floating-point
operations. In a second experiment, we show how the proposed representation can
be used for registering high-resolution meshes to noisy 3D scans. Here, we
present the first method for single-pass high-resolution mesh registration,
avoiding time-consuming per-scan optimization and allowing real-time execution.

this question, we investigate the effect induced by the inflaton in the WMAP7
data using the warm inflationary model. In this model, slow-roll and
perturbation parameters are given in terms of the inflaton thermal
distribution. We show that this distribution depends on the orbital radius of
the brane motion under the interaction potential of other branes in extra
dimensions. Thus, an enhancement in the brane inflation can be a signature of
an orbital motion in extra dimensions and consequently, some signals of other
branes can be detected by observational data. According to experimental data,
the N = 50 case leads to ns = 0:96, where N and ns are the number of e-folds
and the spectral index, respectively. This standard case may be found in the
range 0:01 < R(Tensor-scalar) < 0:22, where R(Tensor-scalar) is the

applying the zeroth- to fourth-order moments of the Vlasov equation and the
modified electromagnetic Maxwell equations. A characteristic of the Kappa
distribution (indicated by $\kappa$ index) is explicit in the equation for the
parallel component of the electron heat flux (parallel to the ambient magnetic
field line) and differs from the equation derived for the proton heat flux due
to the different nature of the distributions. Within the large $\kappa$ index,
the equations for the two-fluid model tend to the equations obtained by the
Maxwellian distribution. Using an iterated Crank-Nicolson method, the coupled

that at (0.3 - 1) AU from the Sun, the electron density, components of

showed that near the Earth, the flow speed (electron or proton) increases with

separation may not occur simultaneously on both sides of the body. During an
intermediate phase, slamming loads are governed by a competition between the
local drop in pressure due to partial flow separation and the ongoing expansion
of the wetted area. As a first benchmark for the model, we consider the water
entry of an inclined flat plate and compare the FBC estimates with the results
of a nonlinear model. Then, we consider the case of a foil and compare the FBC
results with Computational Fluid Dynamics predictions. In both cases, we find

deploys a novel information flow model of system-wide dynamically generated

Kernel Distillation (DKD) model to facilitate small networks for estimating

particular, DKD introduces a light-weight distillator to online distill pose
kernels via leveraging temporal cues from the previous frame in a one-shot

matching procedure between the pose kernels and the current frame, which can be
efficiently computed via simple convolution. In this way, DKD fast transfers
pose knowledge from one frame to provide compact guidance for body joint
localization in the following frame, which enables utilization of small
networks in video-based pose estimation. To facilitate the training process,
DKD exploits a temporally adversarial training strategy that introduces a
temporal discriminator to help generate temporally coherent pose kernels and
pose estimation results within a long range. Experiments on Penn Action and

10x flops reduction and 2x speedup over previous best model, and its

Starting from an a priori common sense model, we show simple methods to detect
and separate guessing from the genuinely thought responses. In addition, we
show that the group of responses with low scores (7 or less out of 30) had
different answer choice strategies than the groups with average or high scores,
and that the time-in-testing is an essential parameter to be reported. Our
results suggest that the data should be cleaned to insure that only valid
times-in-testing are included before reporting and comparing statistics. We
analyze in detail the effect of the answer-options randomization and the effect
of the shuffling of the questions order. Our study did not detect any
significant effect of the option randomization alone on the BEMA scores, for
valid times-in-testing. We found clear evidence that shuffling the order of the
independent questions does not affect the scores of the BEMA test, while
shuffling the order of the dependent questions does.

settings such as influenza prediction, there are critical challenges in using
data from one environment in another due to variability in features; even
within disease labels there can be differences (e.g. ""fever"" may mean something
different reported in a doctor's office versus in an online app). Moreover,
models are often built on passive, observational data which contain different
distributions of population subgroups (e.g. men or women). Thus, there are two
forms of instability between environments in this observational transport
problem. We first harness knowledge from health to conceptualize the underlying
causal structure of this problem in a health outcome prediction task. Based on
sources of stability in the model, we posit that for human-sourced data and
health prediction tasks we can combine environment and population information
in a novel population-aware hierarchical Bayesian domain adaptation framework
that harnesses multiple invariant components through population attributes when
needed. We study the conditions under which invariant learning fails, leading
to reliance on the environment-specific attributes. Experimental results for an
influenza prediction task on four datasets gathered from different contexts
show the model can improve prediction in the case of largely unlabelled target
data from a new environment and different constituent population, by harnessing
both environment and population invariant information. This work represents a
novel, principled way to address a critical challenge by blending domain
(health) knowledge and algorithmic innovation. The proposed approach will have
a significant impact in many social settings wherein who and where the data
comes from matters.

metric to distinguish eruptive from non-eruptive active regions based on the
Lorentz force. Furthermore, using a subset of the observed magnetograms, we run
a series of simulations to test whether the time evolution of the metric can be
predicted. The identified metric successfully differentiates active regions
observed to produce eruptions from the non-eruptive ones in our data sample. A
meaningful prediction of the metric can be made between 6 to 16 hours in

observed (sub-)kpc CO discs is in ordered rotation. Nevertheless, low-level
distortions are ubiquitous, indicating that the molecular gas is not fully
relaxed into the host galaxy potential. The majority of the discs, however, are
only marginally resolved, preventing us from drawing strong conclusions. NGC
3557 and NGC 3100 are special cases. The features observed in the CO velocity
curve of NGC 3557 allow us to estimate a super-massive black hole (SMBH) mass
of $(7.10\pm0.02)\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$, in agreement with expectations from
the M$_{\rm SMBH}- \sigma_{*}$ relation. The rotation pattern of NGC 3100 shows
distortions that appear to be consistent with the presence of both a position
angle and inclination warp. Non-negligible radial motions are also found in the
plane of the CO disc, likely consistent with streaming motions associated with
the spiral pattern found in the inner regions of the disc. The dominant radial
motions are likely to be inflows, supporting a scenario in which the cold gas

curved walls. Therefore many curved boundary schemes have been proposed, but
mostly suffer from mass leakage at the curved boundaries. Several correction

coverage-levels in the environment decay over time. Thus, robots have to
continuously revisit parts of the environment to maintain a desired
coverage-level. Facilitating this in the real world demands we tackle numerous
subproblems. While there exist standard solutions to these subproblems, there
is no complete framework that addresses all of their individual challenges as a
whole in a practical setting. We adapt and combine these solutions to present a
planning framework for persistent coverage with multiple unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, we run a continuous loop of goal assignment and
globally deconflicting, kinodynamic path planning for multiple UAVs. We
evaluate our framework in simulation as well as the real world. In particular,
we demonstrate that (i) our framework exhibits graceful coverage given
sufficient resources, we maintain persistent coverage; if resources are
insufficient (e.g., having too few UAVs for a given size of the enviornment),
coverage-levels decay slowly and (ii) planning with global deconfliction in our
framework incurs a negligibly higher price compared to other weaker, more local

popular means of detecting combustor abnormalities is through continuously
monitoring exhaust gas temperature profiles. Over the years many anomaly
detection technologies have been explored for detecting combustor faults,
however, the performance (detection rate) of anomaly detection solutions
fielded is still inadequate. Advanced technologies that can improve detection
performance are in great need. Aiming for improving anomaly detection
performance, in this paper we introduce recently-developed deep learning (DL)
in machine learning into the combustors anomaly detection application.
Specifically, we use deep learning to hierarchically learn features from the
sensor measurements of exhaust gas temperatures. And we then use the learned
features as the input to a neural network classifier for performing combustor
anomaly detection. Since such deep learned features potentially better capture
complex relations among all sensor measurements and the underlying combustor
behavior than handcrafted features do, we expect the learned features can lead
to a more accurate and robust anomaly detection. Using the data collected from
a real-world gas turbine combustion system, we demonstrated that the proposed

nonlinearity which does not vanish in energy estimates, it has low-mode
instability, and it lacks a maximum principle. However, we prove that our
reduced model is globally well-posed. We also examine its dynamics
computationally. Moreover, while its solutions do not appear to be close
approximations of solutions to the KSE, the solutions do seem to hold many
qualitative similarities with those of the KSE. We examine these properties via

(GRBs), a more general picture, i.e. the hybrid jet model (which introduced
another magnetization parameter $\sigma_{0}$ on the basis of the traditional
fireball model), has been well studied in Gao \& Zhang. However, it still has
not yet been applied to a large GRB sample. Here, we first employ the
""top-down"" approach of Gao \& Zhang to diagnose the photosphere properties at
the central engine to see how the hybrid model can account for the observed
data as well, through applying a {\it Fermi} GRB sample (eight bursts) with the
detected photosphere component, as presented in Li (our Paper I). We infer all
physical parameters of a hybrid problem with three typical values of the radius
of the jet base ($r_{0}$ = 10$^{7}$, 10$^{8}$, and 10$^{9}$ cm). We find that
the dimensionless entropy for all the bursts shows $\eta\gg$ 1 while the
derived (1+$\sigma_{0}$) for five bursts (GRB 081224, GRB 110721A, GRB 090719,
GRB 100707, and GRB 100724) is larger than unity, indicating that in addition
to a hot fireball component, another cold Poynting-flux component may also play
an important role. Our analysis also shows that in a few time bins for all
$r_{0}$ in GRB 081224 and GRB 110721A, the magnetization parameter at $\sim$
10$^{15}$cm (1+$\sigma_{\rm r15}$) is greater than unity, which implies that
internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence may be the
mechanism to power the nonthermal emission, rather than internal shocks. We
conclude that the majority of bursts (probably all) can be well explained by
the hybrid jet problem.

message (CM), a precise jamming (PJ) idea is proposed by making use of the
concept of secure precise wireless transmission (SPWT). Its basic idea is to
focus the transmit energy of artificial noise (AN) onto the neighborhood of
eavesdropper (Eve) by using random subcarrier selection (RSS), directional
modulation, phase alignment (PA), and amplitude beamforming (AB). By doing so,
Eve will be seriously interfered with AN. Here, the conventional joint
optimization of phase and amplitude is converted into two independent phase and
amplitude optimization problems. Considering PJ and SPWT require PA, the joint
optimization problem reduces to an amplitude optimization problem. Then, two
efficient AB schemes are proposed: leakage and maximizing receive
power(Max-RP). With existing equal AB (EAB) as a performance reference,
simulation results show that the proposed Max-RP and leakage AB methods perform
much better than conventional method in terms of both bit-error-rate (BER) and
secrecy rate (SR) at medium and high signal-to-noise ratio regions. The
performance difference between the two proposed leakage and Max-RP amplitude
beamformers is trivial. Additionally, we also find the fact that all three AB
schemes EA, Max-RP, and leakage can form two main peaks of AN and CM around Eve
and the desired receiver (Bob), respectively. This is what we call PJ and SPWT.

that the features generated by the learned discriminator network allow the

treated with a biologic agent will discontinue the drug because of loss of
efficacy. History of previous therapy with another biologic, female sex and
obesity were identified as predictors of drug discontinuations, but their
individual predictive value is low. Objectives. To determine whether machine
learning algorithms can produce models that can accurately predict outcomes of
biologic therapy in psoriasis on individual patient level. Results. All tested
machine learning algorithms could accurately predict the risk of drug
discontinuation and its cause (e.g. lack of efficacy vs adverse event). The
learned generalized linear model achieved diagnostic accuracy of 82%, requiring
under 2 seconds per patient using the psoriasis patients dataset. Input
optimization analysis established a profile of a patient who has best chances
of long-term treatment success: biologic-naive patient under 49 years,
early-onset plaque psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis, weight < 100 kg, and
moderate-to-severe psoriasis activity (DLQI $\geq$ 16; PASI $\geq$ 10).
Moreover, a different generalized linear model is used to predict the length of
treatment for each patient with mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.5 months.
However Pearson Correlation Coefficient indicates 0.935 linear dependencies
between the actual treatment lengths and predicted ones. Conclusions. Machine
learning algorithms predict the risk of drug discontinuation and treatment
duration with accuracy exceeding 80%, based on a small set of predictive
variables. This approach can be used as a decision-making tool, communicating
expected outcomes to the patient, and development of evidence-based guidelines.

typically obtained through multidimensional scaling (MDS), which converts human
dissimilarity ratings for a fixed set of stimuli into a spatial representation.
One can distinguish metric MDS (which assumes that the dissimilarity ratings
are interval or ratio scaled) from nonmetric MDS (which only assumes an ordinal
scale). In our first study, we show that despite its additional assumptions,
metric MDS does not necessarily yield better solutions than nonmetric MDS. In
this chapter, we furthermore propose to learn a mapping from raw stimuli into
the similarity space using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to
generalize the similarity space to unseen inputs. In our second study, we show
that a linear regression from the activation vectors of a convolutional ANN to
similarity spaces obtained by MDS can be successful and that the results are
sensitive to the number of dimensions of the similarity space.

modalities as it offers excellent spatial resolution and soft-tissue contrast.
But, the usage of MRI is limited by its slow acquisition time, which makes it
expensive and causes patient discomfort. In order to accelerate the
acquisition, multiple deep learning networks have been proposed. Recently,
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promising results in MRI
reconstruction. The drawback with the proposed GAN based methods is it does not
incorporate the prior information about the end goal which could help in better
reconstruction. For instance, in the case of cardiac MRI, the physician would
be interested in the heart region which is of diagnostic relevance while
excluding the peripheral regions. In this work, we show that incorporating
prior information about a region of interest in the model would offer better
performance. Thereby, we propose a novel GAN based architecture, Reconstruction
Global-Local GAN (Recon-GLGAN) for MRI reconstruction. The proposed model
contains a generator and a context discriminator which incorporates global and
local contextual information from images. Our model offers significant
performance improvement over the baseline models. Our experiments show that the
concept of a context discriminator can be extended to existing GAN based
reconstruction models to offer better performance. We also demonstrate that the
reconstructions from the proposed method give segmentation results similar to
fully sampled images.

NST has random phase and is characterized by Gaussianity and self-similarity.
Therefore, the NST is modeled by the 2D self-similar process, fractional
Brownian motion (fBm). The Hurst parameter, characteristic of fBm, specifies
the roughness or irregularity of the texture. This leads us to its estimation
and implementation along other features extracted from the structure layer, to
build the ""two-view"" features sets used in our classification scheme. A shallow

maximize the minimum system achievable rate by optimizing the PS ratio at each

solution is obtained in closed-form for both problems. By setting the QoS
threshold constraint the same for each node for the source transmit power

results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed optimal SWIPT PS design

should be delivered oblivious of the network topology, using multiple storage
systems simultaneously, and at minimal coordination overhead. Prior works have
addressed the advantages of error correction coding for distributed storage and
content delivery separately. This work takes a comprehensive approach to
highlighting the tradeoff between storage overhead and transmission overhead in
uncoordinated content delivery from multiple coded storage systems.
  Our contribution is twofold. First, we characterize the tradeoff between
storage and transmission overhead when all participating storage systems employ
the same code. Second, we show that the resulting stark inefficiencies can be
avoided when storage systems use diverse codes. What is more, such code
diversity is not just technically desirable, but presumably will be the reality
in the increasingly heterogeneous networks of the future. To this end, we show
that a mix of Reed-Solomon, low-density parity-check and random linear network

learning applications. It separates the specification of application logic (in
a dataflow graph) from the execution of the logic. TensorFlow's native runtime
executes the application with low overhead across a diverse set of hardware
including CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs. Although the underlying dataflow engine
supporting these features could be applied to computations beyond machine
learning, certain design decisions limit this broader application, such as the
inability for an application to differentiate between data items across
concurrent requests.
  This paper introduces Pipelined TensorFlow (PTF), a system that extends
TensorFlow's semantics to provide support for a broader variety of application
logic. In particular, PTF supports applications that concurrently process
finite batches of data on a single instantiation. PTF adds these semantics by
partitioning the dataflow graph into a pipeline of smaller graphs and tagging
each data item with metadata. These smaller graphs are separated by gates: new
data structures in PTF that buffer data items between graphs and interpret the
metadata to apply the new semantics. PTF's pipeline architecture executes on an
unmodified TensorFlow runtime, maintaining compatibility with many existing
TensorFlow library functions. Our evaluation shows that the pipelining
mechanism of PTF can increase the throughput of a bioinformatics application by
4$\times$ while only increasing its latency by 0.13$\times$. This results in a
sustained genome alignment and sorting rate of 321 megabases/second, using the
compute and I/O resources of 20 computers.

technique for deformed models. We recall this construction, distinguishing
between changes of the gauge frame, which do not affect the theory, and genuine
deformations. We investigate the geometric interpretation of the latter and
argue that they affect the global features of the geometry before gauge fixing.
Exploiting a formal relation between uniform light-cone gauge and static gauge
in a T-dual frame, we interpret such a change as a TsT transformation involving
the two light-cone coordinates. In the static-gauge picture, the $T\bar{T}$ CDD
factor then has a natural interpretation as a Drinfel'd-Reshetikhin twist of
the worldsheet S matrix. To illustrate these ideas, we find the geometries

some, or all, of these stages have been replaced by convolutional neural

as a selection problem, which makes it more challenging to implement as a CNN.
They are therefore generally defined as regressors, converting input images to
score maps and keypoints can be selected with non-maximum suppression. This
paper discusses and compares several recent methods that use CNNs for keypoint
detection. Experiments are performed both on the CNN based approaches, as well
as a selection of conventional methods. In addition to qualitative measures
defined on keypoints and descriptors, the bag-of-words (BoW) model is used to
implement an image retrieval application, in order to determine how the methods

  Runtime verification is an approach to software verification which is
concerned with monitoring and analysis of software and hardware system
executions. Recently, it has gained more consensus as an effective and
promising approach to ensure software reliability, bridging a gap between
formal verification, and conventional testing; monitoring a system during
runtime execution offers additional opportunities for addressing error
recovery, self-adaptation, and other issues that go beyond software
reliability. The goal of VORTEX is to bring together researchers working on
runtime verification for topics covering either theoretical, or practical

increase in the differential resistance at the critical current. This critical
current is typically associated either with breaking of Cooper-pairs
(de-pairing) or with a collective motion of vortices (de-pinning). In this work
we measure superconducting amorphous indium oxide films at low temperatures and
high magnetic fields. Using heat-balance considerations we demonstrate that the
current-voltage characteristics are well explained by electron overheating that
occurs due to the thermal decoupling of the electrons from the host phonons. As
a result the electrons overheat to a significantly higher temperature than that
of the lattice. By solving the heat-balance equation we are able to accurately
predict the critical currents in a variety of experimental conditions. The
heat-balance approach stems directly from energy conservation. As such it is
universal and applies to diverse situations from critical currents in
superconductors to climate bi-stabilities that can initiate another ice-age.
One disadvantage of the universal nature of this approach is that it is
insensitive to the microscopic details of the system, which limits our ability
to draw conclusions regarding the initial departure from equilibrium.

dual to Lovelock black holes using the ""Complexity=Action"" (CA) proposal. We
observe that at early times, the critical time at which the complexity begins
to increase is a decreasing function of the higher order coupling constants,
which implies that the complexity evolves faster than that of Schwarzschild
black holes. At late times, the rate of change of complexity is essentially
determined by the generalised Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term evaluated at
the future singularity. In particular, its ratio to black hole mass is a
characteristic constant, independent of the higher order couplings. Thus, in
the vanishing coupling limit, the result in general does not reduce to that of
Schwarzschild black holes, in spite of that the metric reduces to the latter as
well as the gravitational action. In fact, the two differ by a constant during
the whole time evolution. Including the next-to-leading order term around late
times, we find that as the Einstein case, the late time limit is always
approached from above, thus violating any conjectured upper bound given by the
late time result. For charged Lovelock black holes, we find that with
sufficient charge, the complexity roughly behaves the same as the Einstein
case. However, for smaller charges, the two have some significant differences.
In particular, unlike the Einstein case, in the uncharged limit the complexity
growth rate does not match with the neutral case, differing by a constant in
the whole time evolution.

solvable corner growth model with independent exponentially distributed waiting
times. The rates of the exponentials are given by an addivitely separable
function of the site coordinates. When computing the growth process
(last-passage times) at each site, the horizontal and vertical additive
components of the rates are allowed to also vary respectively with the column
and row number of that site. This setting includes several models of interest
from the literature as special cases. Our main result provides simple explicit
variational formulas for the a.s. first-order asymptotics of the growth process
under a decay condition on the rates. Formulas of similar flavor were
conjectured in arXiv:math/0004082, which we also establish. Subject to further
mild conditions, we prove the existence of the limit shape and describe it
explicitly. We observe that the boundary of the limit shape can develop flat
segments adjacent to the axes and spikes along the axes. Furthermore, we record
the formation of persistent macroscopic spikes and crevices in the cluster that
are nonetheless not visible in the limit shape. As an application of the
results for the growth process, we compute the flux function and limiting
particle profile for the TASEP with the step initial condition and disorder in
the jump rates of particles and holes. Our methodology is based on
concentration bounds and estimating the boundary exit probabilities of the
geodesics in the increment-stationary version of the model, with the only input
from integrable probability being the distributional invariance of the
last-passage times under permutations of columns and rows.

An empirical study",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Background. Pull requests are a common practice for contributing and
reviewing contributions, and are employed both in open-source and industrial
contexts. One of the main goals of code reviews is to find defects in the code,
allowing project maintainers to easily integrate external contributions into a
project and discuss the code contributions. Objective. The goal of this paper
is to understand whether code quality is actually considered when pull requests
are accepted. Specifically, we aim at understanding whether code quality issues
such as code smells, antipatterns, and coding style violations in the pull
request code affect the chance of its acceptance when reviewed by a maintainer
of the project. Method. We conducted a case study among 28 Java open-source
projects, analyzing the presence of 4.7 M code quality issues in 36 K pull
requests. We analyzed further correlations by applying Logistic Regression and
seven machine learning techniques (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extremely
Randomized Trees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost). Results. Unexpectedly,
code quality turned out not to affect the acceptance of a pull request at all.
As suggested by other works, other factors such as the reputation of the
maintainer and the importance of the feature delivered might be more important
than code quality in terms of pull request acceptance. Conclusions. Researchers
already investigated the influence of the developers' reputation and the pull
request acceptance. This is the first work investigating if quality of the code
in pull requests affects the acceptance of the pull request or not. We
recommend that researchers further investigate this topic to understand if
different measures or different tools could provide some useful measures.

languages using a single model, is of great practical importance due to its
advantages in simplifying the training process, reducing online maintenance
costs, and enhancing low-resource and zero-shot translation. Given there are
thousands of languages in the world and some of them are very different, it is
extremely burdensome to handle them all in a single model or use a separate
model for each language pair. Therefore, given a fixed resource budget, e.g.,
the number of models, how to determine which languages should be supported by
one model is critical to multilingual NMT, which, unfortunately, has been
ignored by previous work. In this work, we develop a framework that clusters
languages into different groups and trains one multilingual model for each
cluster. We study two methods for language clustering: (1) using prior
knowledge, where we cluster languages according to language family, and (2)
using language embedding, in which we represent each language by an embedding
vector and cluster them in the embedding space. In particular, we obtain the
embedding vectors of all the languages by training a universal neural machine
translation model. Our experiments on 23 languages show that the first
clustering method is simple and easy to understand but leading to suboptimal
translation accuracy, while the second method sufficiently captures the
relationship among languages well and improves the translation accuracy for
almost all the languages over baseline methods

Traveling Salesman Problem. We analyze the problem of determining whether the
weight of a given cycle can be decreased by a popular $k$-opt move. Earlier
work has shown that (i) assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, there is no
algorithm to find an improving $k$-opt move in time $f(k)n^{o(k/\log k)}$ for
any function $f$, while (ii) it is possible to improve on the brute-force
running time of $O(n^k)$ and save linear factors in the exponent. Modern TSP
heuristics show that very good global solutions can already be reached using
only the top-$O(1)$ most promising edges incident to each vertex. Motivated by
this, we study the problem of finding an improving $k$-move in bounded degree
graphs, presenting new algorithms and conditional lower bounds. We show that
the aforementioned ETH lower bound also holds for graphs of maximum degree
three, but that in bounded-degree graphs the best improving $k$-move can be
found in time $O(n^{23k/135+o(k)})$. This improves upon the best-known bounds
for general graphs. Due to its practical importance, we devote special
attention to the range of $k$ in which improving $k$-moves in bounded-degree
graphs can be found in quasi-linear time. For $k\le 7$, we give quasi-linear
time algorithms for general weights. For $k=8$ we obtain a quasi-linear time
algorithm for polylogarithmic weights. On the other hand, based on established
fine-grained complexity hypotheses, we prove that the $k=9$ case does not admit
quasi-linear time algorithms. Hence we fully characterize the values of $k$ for
which quasi-linear time algorithms exist for polylogarithmic weights on
bounded-degree graphs. As a byproduct, we show a new bound on pathwidth of even
graphs which results in improved running time bounds for counting $k$-vertex
paths and cycles.

applications. Inspired by great progress of deep learning, deep re-ID models
began to be popular and gained state-of-the-art performance. However, recent
works found that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial
examples, posing potential threats to DNNs based applications. This phenomenon
throws a serious question about whether deep re-ID based systems are vulnerable
to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we take the first attempt to implement
robust physical-world attacks against deep re-ID. We propose a novel attack
algorithm, called advPattern, for generating adversarial patterns on clothes,
which learns the variations of image pairs across cameras to pull closer the
image features from the same camera, while pushing features from different

evade person search, or impersonate a target person to fool deep re-ID models
in physical world. We evaluate the effectiveness of our transformable patterns
on adversaries'clothes with Market1501 and our established PRCS dataset. The
experimental results show that the rank-1 accuracy of re-ID models for matching
the adversary decreases from 87.9% to 27.1% under Evading Attack. Furthermore,
the adversary can impersonate a target person with 47.1% rank-1 accuracy and
67.9% mAP under Impersonation Attack. The results demonstrate that deep re-ID
systems are vulnerable to our physical attacks.

strongly relies on the contraction with divergenceless tensors. In four
dimensions these are the Einstein tensor and the double dual Riemann tensor.
Even though they are divergenceless on their own, their combination ceases to
be. In the case of massless 2-forms we are not able to establish non-minimal
couplings of the 2-form to the gravity sector with second order equations of
motion due to the impossibility of building consistent combinations of
divergenceless tensors. Using the systematical construction in terms of the
Levi-Civita tensor, we aim at constructing Galileon-like derivative
self-interactions for the massive 2-form. Apart from $L_2$ and $L_4$ we are not
able to construct further Galileon-like Lagrangians. For the massive case, an
important non-minimal coupling between the 2-form and the double dual Riemann

Promoting the interactions in $L_4$ requires the presence of appropriate
non-minimal couplings and we give concrete examples for this.

external driving, which can alter the relative stability of different
attractors. Under such circumstances, one may ask whether any clear
relationship holds between the specific pattern of external driving and the
particular attractor states selected by a driven multistable system. To gain
insight into this question, we numerically study driven disordered mechanical
networks of bistable springs which possess a vast number of stable
configurations arising from the two stable rest lengths of each spring, thereby
capturing the essential physical properties of a broad class of multistable
systems. We find that the attractor states of driven disordered multistable
mechanical networks are fine-tuned with respect to the pattern of external
forcing to have low work absorption from it. Furthermore, we find that these
drive-specific attractor states are even more stable than expected for a given
level of work absorption. Our results suggest that the driven exploration of
the vast configuration space of these systems is biased towards states with
exceptional relationship to the driving environment, and could therefore be
used to `discover' states with desired response properties in systems with a
vast landscape of diverse configurations.

the content of relational databases with incomplete information was the fuzzy
relational model by Buckles and Petry. This structure was based on two
generalizations of the traditional relational model: (1) A tuple component can
be any subset of the corresponding domain, rather than a single element and (2)
A similarity relation is defined on each domain. This relation satisfies the
properties of reflexivity, symmetry and max-min transitivity, thus having the
equality relation as a special case. This generalization keeps two key
properties of the relational model - that no two different tuples represent the
same information and that the application of any operation of the relation
algebra has a unique result.
  Shenoi and Melton generalized this model and showed how the existence of
equivalence classes over the attribute domains can also be preserved with a
relation that only satisfies the properties of reflexivity and symmetry
(proximity relation). The motivation for this generalization is the strictness
of the max-min transitivity property of similarity relations, which complicates
the construction of this relation for some domain types.
  An important characteristic of the Shenoi-Melton model is the dependence of
the equivalence classes upon the current content of the database. This
characteristic, together with the way the equivalence relation is constructed
by the proximity relation, can lead to the equivalence classes that don't
correspond well with some database query types.
  Here we will present a different way of forming the equivalence classes over
the attribute domains in fuzzy relational databases in which they depend only
on the attribute domain and not on the current database state. We will also
show a simple method for automatic construction of proximity relations over
some domain types.

distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which renders the
controller fully distributedly implementable, recursively feasible and ensures
point-wise convergence of the states. The aforementioned properties are
guaranteed through a properly selected distributed invariant set and
distributed terminal constraints for the mean and covariance. The paper closes
with an example highlighting the chance constraint satisfaction, numerical
properties and scalability of our approach.

thereby extending the case of single-mode aggregates to multimodal ones in the
framework of a two-phase model which is characterized by the presence of
crystalline and grain-boundary phases. Both analytic and graphic forms of the
generalized Hall-Petch relations are obtained for multimodal samples with BCC
($\alpha$-phase Fe), FCC (Cu, Al, Ni) and HCP (Cu, Al, Ni) and HCP
($\alpha$-Ti, Zr) crystalline lattices at $T=300K$ with different values of the
grain-boundary (second) phase. The case of dispersion hardening due to a
natural incorporation into the model of a third phase including additional
particles of doping materials is considered. The maximum of yield strength and
the respective extremal grain size of samples are shifted by changing both the
input from different grain modes and the values at the second and third phases.
We study the influence of multimodality and dispersion hardening on the
temperature-dimensional effect for yield strength within the range of
$150-350K$.

indicate that color blending effects of physical materials as backgrounds are
nearly the same as their corresponding poster backgrounds, even though the
colors of each pair are only a metameric match. More importantly, our results
suggest that given the current capabilities of optical see-through head-mounted

available to user interface (UI) designers. In worse cases, there are unknown
or unexpected color interactions that no UI or system designers can plan for;
significantly crippling the usability of the UI or altering the semantic
interpretation of graphical elements. Further, our results support the concept
of an adaptive AR system which can dynamically alter the color of UI elements
based on predicted background color interactions. These interactions can be
studied and predicted through methods such as those presented in this work.

platforms for dialogue have opened up. However technology transfer to the pubic
has not been implemented, such that regular public can access and make use of
secure and decentralized software. Most blockchain solutions till date deal
with financial applications or monetary transactions, which may not be helpful
or be accessible to the general public, especially the lower levels of the
financial society. Medi-Chain is a people-first medical blockchain with a
usable desktop application and interface which makes use of cutting-edge
blockchain technology along with BFT consensus protocols to ensure highly
secure and private medical data records. This paper aims to bring about a
change in how blockchains-as-a-service is perceived and how adoption of new
technology is largely based on usability and ease of adoption.

  multicomponent fluid under confinement","12pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present mesoscale numerical simulations based on the coupling of the
fluctuating lattice Boltzmann method (FLBM) for multicomponent systems with a
wetted finite-size particle model. This newly coupled methodologies are used to
study the motion of a spherical particle driven by a constant body force in a
confined channel with a fixed square cross-section. The channel is filled with
a mixture of two liquids under the effect of thermal fluctuations. After some
validations steps in absence of fluctuations, we study the fluctuations in the
particle's velocity at changing thermal energy, applied force, particle size,
and particle wettability. The importance of fluctuations with respect to the
mean settling velocity is quantitatively assessed, especially in comparison to
unconfined situations. Results show that the expected effects of confinement
are very well captured by the numerical simulations, wherein the confinement
strongly enhances the importance of velocity fluctuations, which can be one
order of magnitude larger than what expected in unconfined domains. The
observed findings underscore the versatility of the proposed methodology in
highlighting the effects of confinement on the motion of particles in presence
of thermal fluctuations.
