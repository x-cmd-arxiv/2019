objects can be reconstructed from their respective counterparts in tree-level
amplitudes. This procedure is at its most powerful when aligned with flexible
colour decompositions of tree-level QCD amplitudes. In this note we derive such
decompositions for amplitudes with an arbitrary number of quarks and gluons
from the same principle that is used to bootstrap kinematics - unitarity
factorisation. In the process we formulate new multi-quark bases and provide
closed-form expressions for the new decompositions. We then elaborate upon
their application in colour decompositions of loop multi-quark amplitudes.

estimate the energy of the flares in the TESS band-pass. Overall, we have 1834

$2.4\times 10^{35}$~erg. We find none of the stars in our sample show any

large number of scattering events with nuclei inside stars are necessary to
slow down the dark matter particles below the escape velocity of the stars, at
which point the Dark Matter (DM) particle becomes trapped, or captured. Using
the recently developed analytical formalism for multiscatter capture, combined
with the latest results on the constraints of dark-matter-baryon scattering

implies a DM dependent cutoff on the initial mass function (IMF) of Pop. III
stars, thus opening up the intriguing possibility of constraining DM properties
using the IMF of extremely metal-poor stars.

modular modeling framework compatible with different types of vehicles is
proposed with methods to ensure modeling credibility. Then, the simulation
software system is developed by the model-based design framework, whose modular
programming methods and automatic code generation functions ensure the
efficiency, credibility, and standardization of the system development process.
Finally, an FPGA-based real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform is
proposed to ensure the comprehensiveness and credibility of the simulation and
test results. In the end, the proposed platform is applied to a multicopter
control system. By comparing with experimental results, the accuracy and
credibility of the simulation testing results are verified by using the
simulation credibility assessment method proposed in our previous work. To
verify the practicability of the proposed platform, several successful
applications are presented for the multicopter rapid prototyping, estimation
algorithm verification, autonomous flight testing, and automatic safety testing

relighting, we must infer albedo, shape, and illumination from a human

spherical harmonics (SH) lighting. However, because they often ignore light
occlusion, inferred shapes are biased and relit images are unnaturally bright
particularly at hollowed regions such as armpits, crotches, or garment
wrinkles. This paper introduces the first attempt to infer light occlusion in
the SH formulation directly. Based on supervised learning using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), we infer not only an albedo map, illumination but also
a light transport map that encodes occlusion as nine SH coefficients per pixel.
The main difficulty in this inference is the lack of training datasets compared
to unlimited variations of human portraits. Surprisingly, geometric information
including occlusion can be inferred plausibly even with a small dataset of
synthesized human figures, by carefully preparing the dataset so that the CNNs
can exploit the data coherency. Our method accomplishes more realistic
relighting than the occlusion-ignored formulation.

coverage means resorting to multi-order echelle spectrographs. Assembling the
spectra from many pieces results in lower fidelity of their shapes. We aim to
offer the community a library of high signal-to-noise spectra with reliable
continuum shapes. Furthermore, the using an integral field unit (IFU)
alleviates the issue of slit losses. Our library was build with the MUSE
(Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) IFU instrument. We obtained spectra over
nearly the entire visual band (lambda~4800-9300 Ang). We assembled a library of
35 high-quality MUSE spectra for a subset of the stars from the X-shooter
Spectral Library. We verified the continuum shape of these spectra with
synthetic broad band colors derived from the spectra. We also report some
spectral indices from the Lick system, derived from the new observations. We
offer a high-fidelity set of stellar spectra that covers the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. It can be useful for both extragalactic and
stellar work and demonstrates that the IFUs are excellent tools for building
reliable spectral libraries.

machine learning algorithms such as trees or neural networks. Though bagging is
now widely used in practice and many empirical studies have explored its
behavior, we still know little about the theoretical properties of bagged
predictions. In this paper, we theoretically investigate how the bagging method
can reduce the Mean Squared Error (MSE) when applied on a statistical
estimator. First, we prove that for any estimator, increasing the number of
bagged estimators $N$ in the average can only reduce the MSE. This intuitive
result, observed empirically and discussed in the literature, has not yet been
rigorously proved. Second, we focus on the standard estimator of variance
called unbiased sample variance and we develop an exact analytical expression
of the MSE for this estimator with bagging.
  This allows us to rigorously discuss the number of iterations $N$ and the
batch size $m$ of the bagging method. From this expression, we state that only
if the kurtosis of the distribution is greater than $\frac{3}{2}$, the MSE of
the variance estimator can be reduced with bagging. This result is important
because it demonstrates that for distribution with low kurtosis, bagging can
only deteriorate the performance of a statistical prediction. Finally, we
propose a novel general-purpose algorithm to estimate with high precision the
variance of a sample.

estimate the component's effective temperatures to be 12930(540)~K and
4260(24)~K. The combined light-curve and orbital solutions, also constrained by
a very accurate Gaia Data Release 2 parallax, give the following values of the

$3.9\pm0.2$ and 13.97\pm0.05$~\Rnom, and a~mass ratio $10.0\pm0.5$.

final slow phase of the mass exchange after the mass-ratio reversal. Contrary
to what has been seen for similar binaries like AU~Mon, no cyclic light

constrained problems, which utilizes linear approximations of the constraint
functions to define the extrapolation (or acceleration) step. We show that this
method is a unified algorithm that achieves the best-known rate of convergence
for solving different functional constrained convex composite problems,
including convex or strongly convex, and smooth or nonsmooth problems with a
stochastic objective and/or stochastic constraints. Many of these rates of
convergence were in fact obtained for the first time in the literature. In
addition, ConEx is a single-loop algorithm that does not involve any penalty
subproblems. Contrary to existing primal-dual methods, it does not require the
projection of Lagrangian multipliers into a (possibly unknown) bounded set.
Second, for nonconvex functional constrained problems, we introduce a new
proximal point method that transforms the initial nonconvex problem into a
sequence of convex problems by adding quadratic terms to both the objective and
constraints. Under a certain MFCQ-type assumption, we establish the convergence
and rate of convergence of this method to KKT points when the convex

approximate solutions of the subproblems are computed by the aforementioned

fluctuation near the black hole horizon to produce a particle that crosses the
cosmological horizon is shown to equal to the convolution of two thermal
coefficients, one at the cosmological temperature and one at the black hole

static SdS coordinates. In this sense virtual thermal propagation underlies the
production process. This representation leads to the useful result that the
geometric optics approximation is reliable when used together with a low
frequency cut-off determined by the transmission coefficient. The large black
hole limit is a quasi-equilibrium situation as both temperatures approach the
common value of zero, the particle spectra become equal, and both emissions are
exponentially suppressed. Small black holes radiate as thermal bodies and
absorb a tiny flux of cosmological particles. The behavior of the quantum

  semi-permeable membranes","32 pages, 1 figure",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using techniques of the theory of semigroups of linear operators we study the
question of approximating solutions to equations governing diffusion in thin
layers separated by a semi-permeable membrane. We show that as thickness of the
layers converges to $0$, the solutions, which by nature are functions of $3$
variables, gradually lose dependence on the vertical variable and thus may be
regarded as functions of $2$ variables. The limit equation describes diffusion
on the lower and upper sides of a two-dimensional surface (the membrane) with
jumps from one side to the other. The latter possibility is expressed as an
additional term in the generator of the limit semigroup, and this term is build
from permeability coefficients of the membrane featuring in the transmission
conditions of the approximating equations (i.e., in the description of the
domains of the generators of the approximating semigroups). We prove this
convergence result in the spaces of square integrable and continuous functions,
and study the way the choice of transmission conditions influences the limit.

processors that supports searches, insertions and deletions, and has a finger
at each end. This is to our knowledge the first implementation of a parallel
search structure that is work-optimal with respect to the finger bound and yet
has very good parallelism (within a factor of O( (log p)^2 ) of optimal). We
utilize an extended implicit batching framework that transparently facilitates
the use of FS by any parallel program P that is modelled by a dynamically
generated DAG D where each node is either a unit-time instruction or a call to
FS.
  The total work done by either version of FS is bounded by the finger bound
F[L] (for some linearization L of D ), i.e. each operation on an item with
finger distance r takes O( log r + 1 ) amortized work; it is cheaper for items
closer to a finger. Running P using the simpler version takes O( ( T[1] + F[L]
) / p + T[inf] + d * ( (log p)^2 + log n ) ) time on a greedy scheduler, where
T[1],T[inf] are the size and span of D respectively, and n is the maximum
number of items in FS, and d is the maximum number of calls to FS along any
path in D. Using the faster version, this is reduced to O( ( T[1] + F[L] ) / p
+ T[inf] + d * (log p)^2 + s[L] ) time, where s[L] is the weighted span of D
where each call to FS is weighted by its cost according to F[L]. We also sketch
how to extend FS to support a fixed number of movable fingers.
  The data structures in our paper fit into the dynamic multithreading
paradigm, and their performance bounds are directly composable with other data
structures given in the same paradigm. Also, the results can be translated to
practical implementations using work-stealing schedulers.

grow and accrete solids. This ensures that the material they accrete - pebbles,
as well as (small) planetesimals - will vaporize to enrich their atmospheres.
Enrichment modifies an envelope's structure and significantly alters its
further evolution. Our aim is to describe the formation of planets with
polluted envelopes from the moment that impactors begin to sublimate to beyond
the disk's eventual dissipation. We constructed an analytical interior
structure model, characterized by a hot and uniformly mixed high-Z vapor layer
surrounding the core, located below the usual unpolluted radiative-convective
regions. The evolution of planets with uniformly mixed polluted envelopes
follows four potential phases. Initially, the central core grows directly
through impacts and rainout until the envelope becomes hot enough to vaporize
and absorb all incoming solids. We find that a planet reaches runaway accretion
when the sum of its core and vapor mass exceeds a value that we refer to as the
critical metal mass - a criterion that supersedes the traditional critical core
mass. It scales positively with both the pollutant's evaporation temperature
and with the planet's core mass. Hence, planets at shorter orbital separations
require the accretion of more solids to reach runaway as they accrete less
volatile materials. If the solids accretion rate dries up, we identify the
decline of the mean molecular weight - dilution - as a mechanism to limit gas
accretion during a polluted planet's embedded cooling phase. When the disk
ultimately dissipates, the envelope's inner temperature declines and its vapor
eventually rains out, augmenting the mass of the core. The energy release that
accompanies this does not result in significant mass-loss, as it only occurs
after the planet has substantially contracted.

  - the output values are within distance $d$ of each other.
  Classically, the values are assumed to be from an $m$-dimensional Euclidean

  In this work, we study the task in a discrete setting, where input values
with some structure expressible as a graph. Namely, the input values are
vertices of a finite graph $G$ and the goal is to output vertices that are
within distance $d$ of each other in $G$, but still remain in the graph-induced

synchronous systems, we show tight resilience bounds for the exact variants of

arises from the currently ongoing intense research activity in the physics of
twisted bilayer graphene. In experimental samples of pristine twisted bilayer
graphene, which are nominally free of impurities and defects, the main source
of disorder is believed to arise from the unavoidable and uncontrollable
non-uniformity of the twist angle across the sample. To address this new
physics of twist-angle disorder, we develop a real-space, microscopic model of
twisted bilayer graphene where the angle enters as a free parameter. In
particular, we focus on the size of single-particle energy gaps separating the
miniband from the rest of the spectrum, the Van Hove peaks, the renormalized
Dirac cone velocity near charge neutrality, and the minibandwidth. We find that
the energy gaps and minibandwidth are strongly affected by disorder while the
renormalized velocity remains virtually unchanged. We discuss the implications
of our results for the ongoing experiments on twisted bilayer graphene. Our
theory is readily generalized to future studies of twist angle disorder effects

The number counts of RGB stars are converted to total stellar halo luminosity
using a suite of isochrones weighted by age and metallicity, and by applying a
volume correction based on the stellar halo density profile. Our method is
tested and calibrated using Galaxia and N-body models. We find a total
luminosity (out to 100 kpc) of L_halo = 7.9 +/- 2.0 x 10^8 L_Sun excluding Sgr,
and L_halo = 9.4 +/- 2.4 x 10^8 L_Sun including Sgr. These values are
appropriate for our adopted stellar halo density profile and metallicity

quantified and discussed. Assuming a stellar mass-to-light ratio appropriate
for a Kroupa initial mass function (M*/L = 1.5), we estimate a stellar halo
mass of M*_halo = 1.4 +/- 0.4 x 10^9 M_Sun. This mass is larger than previous
estimates in the literature, but is in good agreement with the emerging picture

Finally, we argue that the combination of a ~10^9 M_Sun mass and an average

an ensemble learning method based on decision tree regression, to predict
cluster masses using an input feature set. The feature set uses core-excised
X-ray luminosity and a variety of morphological parameters, including surface
brightness concentration, smoothness, asymmetry, power ratios, and ellipticity.
The regressor is cross-validated and calibrated on a training sample of 1,615
clusters (80% of sample), and then results are reported as applied to a test
sample of 426 clusters (20% of sample). This procedure is performed for two
different mock observation series in an effort to bracket the potential
enhancement in mass predictions that can be made possible by including
dynamical state information. The first series is computed from idealized
Chandra-like mock cluster observations, with high spatial resolution, long
exposure time (1 Ms), and the absence of background. The second series is
computed from realistic-condition eROSITA mocks with lower spatial resolution,
short exposures (2 ks), instrument effects, and background photons modeled. We
report a 20% reduction in the mass estimation scatter when either series is
used in our random forest model compared to a standard regression model that
only employs core-excised luminosity. The morphological parameters that hold
the highest feature importance are smoothness, asymmetry, and surface
brightness concentration. Hence, these parameters, which encode the dynamical
state of the cluster, can be used to make more accurate predictions of cluster
masses in upcoming surveys, offering a crucial step forward for cosmological
analyses.

spectroscopically confirmed PSBs, recently identified in the UDS field, and
perform a stacking analysis in order to analyse the structure of strong
interstellar absorption features such as Mg ii ($\lambda2800$ Ang.). We find
that for massive ($M_* > 10^{10}\rm\,M_{\odot}$) PSBs at $z > 1$, there is
clear evidence for a strong blue-shifted component to the Mg ii absorption

that such outflows are typical in massive PSBs at this epoch, and potentially
represent the residual signature of a feedback process that quenched these

velocity dispersion $\sigma_*$ for these PSBs of $\sim200\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$,
which confirms they are intrinsically massive in nature (dynamical mass $M_{\rm

exceptionally compact ($r_{\rm e}\sim1$--$2\rm\,kpc$) and spheroidal (Sersic

during a recent compaction event (e.g. major merger or disc collapse) that
triggered either a centralised starburst or active galactic nuclei (AGN)
activity. Finally, we find no evidence for AGN signatures in the optical
spectra of these PSBs, suggesting they were either quenched by stellar feedback
from the starburst itself, or that if AGN feedback is responsible, the AGN
episode that triggered quenching does not linger into the post-starburst phase.

and distance from the disc mid-plane. The [M/H]-age relations support claims
that radial migration has a significant effect in the plane of the disc. Using
the [M/H] bin with the youngest mean age at each radial zone in the plane of
the disc, the present-day metallicity gradient is measured to be $-0.059 \pm

However, this mechanism cannot explain type I outbursts that have been observed

analytic estimates we find that in a circular orbit binary, a nearly coplanar
disk around the Be star can become eccentric. The extreme mass ratio of the
binary leads to the presence of the 3:1 Lindblad resonance inside the Be star
disk and this drives eccentricity growth. Therefore the neutron star can
capture material each time it approaches the disk apastron, on a timescale up

contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion, minimization of the loss of

the complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during
the past two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the
advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and
cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its
popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through
introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones aim at
discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models. The main
contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of the art of ML models
in flood prediction and to give insight into the most suitable models. In this
paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked through a qualitative
analysis of robustness, accuracy, effectiveness, and speed are particularly
investigated to provide an extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used
in the field. The performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth
understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a
comprehensive evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the
most promising prediction methods for both long-term and short-term floods.
Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood prediction
models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data decomposition,
algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported as the most effective
strategies for the improvement of ML methods.

WFIRST, will probe the period of the formation of first galaxies and quasars,
and open up the last frontier for structure formation. Recent simulations as
well as observations have suggested that these galaxies are strongly clustered
(with large scale bias $\gtrsim6$), and therefore have significant cosmic
variance. In this work, we use \texttt{BlueTides}, the largest volume
cosmological simulation of galaxy formation, to directly estimate the cosmic
variance for current and upcoming surveys. Given its resolution and volume,
\texttt{BlueTides} can probe the bias and cosmic variance of $z>7$ galaxies
between magnitude $M_{UV}\sim-16$ to $M_{UV}\sim-22$ over survey areas
$\sim0.1\ \mathrm{arcmin}^2$ to $\sim 10~\mathrm{deg}^2$. Within this regime,
the cosmic variance decreases with survey area/ volume as a power law with
exponents between $\sim-0.25$ to $\sim-0.45$. For the planned
$10~\mathrm{deg}^2$ field of WFIRST, the cosmic variance is between $3\%$ to
$10\%$. Upcoming JWST medium/ deep surveys with areas up to $A\sim100\
\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ will have cosmic variance ranging from $\sim 20-50\%$.
Lensed surveys have the highest cosmic variance $\gtrsim 40\%$; the cosmic
variance of $M_{UV}\lesssim-16$ galaxies is $\lesssim100\%$ up to $z\sim11$. At
higher redshifts such as $z\sim12~(14)$, effective volumes of
$\gtrsim(8~\mathrm{Mpc}/h)^3$ ($\gtrsim(12\ \mathrm{Mpc}/h)^3$) are required to
limit the cosmic variance to within $100\%$. Finally, we find that cosmic
variance is larger than Poisson variance and forms the dominant component of
the overall uncertainty in all current and upcoming surveys. We present our
calculations in the form of simple fitting functions and an online cosmic
variance calculator (CV_AT_COSMIC_DAWN) which we publicly release.

of the intraband and interband optical transitions are both given by universal
functions of photon energy $\Omega$ and chemical potential $\mu$ normalized to
the energy gap. We provide analytic formulas for both small and large
$\Omega/2\Delta$ and $\mu/\Delta$ limits. These define, respectively, Dirac and
semi-Dirac-like regions. For $\Omega/2\Delta$ and $\mu/\Delta$ of order one,
there are deviations from these asymptotic behaviors. Considering optics and
also transport, such as dc conductivity, thermal conductivity and the Lorenz

the semi-Dirac regime as the gap $\Delta$ is varied.

distributions. Previous methods tend to tackle the whole image with a single
fixed structure, which is unable to handle diverse complicated scenes with
different crowd densities. Hence, we propose the Adaptive Capacity Multi-scale
convolutional neural networks (ACM-CNN), a novel crowd counting approach which
can assign different capacities to different portions of the input. The
intuition is that the model should focus on important regions of the input
image and optimize its capacity allocation conditioning on the crowd intensive
degree. ACM-CNN consists of three types of modules: a coarse network, a fine
network, and a smooth network. The coarse network is used to explore the areas
that need to be focused via count attention mechanism, and generate a rough
feature map. Then the fine network processes the areas of interest into a fine
feature map. To alleviate the sense of division caused by fusion, the smooth
network is designed to combine two feature maps organically to produce
high-quality density maps. Extensive experiments are conducted on five
mainstream datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model for both density estimation and crowd counting tasks.

increasing number of connected devices. In recent years, narrowband radio
technology has emerged to address this situation: Narrowband Internet of Things
(NB-IoT), which is now part of 5G. Supporting massive connectivity becomes
particularly demanding in extreme coverage scenarios such as underground or
deep inside buildings sites. We propose a novel strategy for these situations
focused on optimizing NB-IoT shared channels through the selection of link
parameters: modulation and coding scheme, as well as the number of repetitions.
These parameters are established by the base station (BS) for each block
transmitted until reaching a target block error rate (BLER_t ). A wrong
selection of these magnitudes leads to radio resource waste and a decrease in
the number of possible concurrent connections. Specifically, our strategy is
based on a look-up table (LUT) scheme which is used for rapidly delivering the
optimal link parameters given a target QoS. To validate our proposal, we
compare with alternative strategies using an open source NB-IoT uplink
simulator. The experiments are based on transmitting blocks of 256 bits using
an AWGN channel over the NPUSCH. Results show that, especially under extreme
conditions, only a few options for link parameters are available, favoring
robustness against measurement uncertainties. Our strategy minimizes resource
usage in all scenarios of acknowledged mode and remarkably reduces losses in
the unacknowledged mode, presenting also substantial gains in performance. We
expect to influence future BS software design and implementation, favoring
connection support under extreme environments.

primitives of quantum information processing and microscopic magnetic sensing.
The highly localized nature of most fermionic spins decouples them from
parasitic degrees of freedom, but makes long-range interoperability difficult
to achieve. In light of this challenge, an active effort is underway to
integrate fermionic spins with circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), which
was originally developed in the field of superconducting qubits to achieve
single-shot, quantum-non-demolition (QND) measurements and long-range
couplings. However, single-shot readout of an individual spin with cQED has
remained elusive due to the difficulty of coupling a resonator to a particle
trapped by a charge-confining potential. Here we demonstrate the first
single-shot, cQED readout of a single spin. In our novel implementation, the
spin is that of an individual superconducting quasiparticle trapped in the
Andreev levels of a semiconductor nanowire Josephson element. Due to a
spin-orbit interaction inside the nanowire, this ""superconducting spin""
directly determines the flow of supercurrent through the element. We harnessed
this spin-dependent supercurrent to achieve both a zero-field spin splitting as
well as a long-range interaction between the quasiparticle and a
superconducting microwave resonator. Owing to the strength of this interaction
in our device, measuring the resultant spin-dependent resonator frequency
yielded QND spin readout with 92% fidelity in 1.9 $\mu$s and allowed us to
monitor the quasiparticle's spin in real time. These results pave the way for
new ""fermionic cQED"" devices: superconducting spin qubits operating at zero
magnetic field, devices in which the spin has enhanced governance over the
circuit, and time-domain measurements of Majorana modes.

For this purpose, we combine deep learning techniques and geometric algorithms

establish 2D-3D correspondences from a single RGB image using a deep network.
Second, we recover 3D poses and refine the focal length by minimizing the

the geometric prior given by the focal length for 3D pose estimation. This
results in two advantages: First, we achieve significantly improved 3D

analyzing polarimetric observations of spectral lines. Polarimetric signals
induced by chromospheric magnetic fields are, however, particularly weak, and
in most cases very close to the detection limit of current instrumentation.
Because of this, there are only few observational studies that have
successfully reconstructed the three components of the magnetic field vector in
the chromosphere. Traditionally, the signal-to-noise ratio of observations has
been improved by performing time-averages or spatial averages, but in both
cases, some information is lost. More advanced techniques, like
principal-component-analysis, have also been employed to take advantage of the
sparsity of the observations in the spectral direction. In the present study,
we propose to use the spatial coherence of the observations to reduce the noise
using deep-learning techniques. We design a neural network that is capable of
recovering weak signals under a complex noise corruption (including
instrumental artifacts and non-linear post-processing). The training of the
network is carried out without a priori knowledge of the clean signals, or an
explicit statistical characterization of the noise or other corruption. We only
use the same observations as our generative model. The performance of this
method is demonstrated on both, synthetic experiments and real data. We show
examples of the improvement in typical signals obtained in current telescopes
such as the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope. The presented method can recover
weak signals equally well no matter on what spectral line or spectral sampling
is used. It is especially suitable for cases when the wavelength sampling is
scarce.

fragmentation, and may allow for the formation of massive black hole seeds.
Here we report on the abundance of pristine atomic cooling haloes found and on
the specific physical conditions that allow for the formation of these
direct-collapse-black-hole (DCBH) haloes. In total in our simulations we find
that 79 DCBH haloes form before a redshift of 11.6. We find that the formation
of pristine atomic haloes is driven by the rapid assembly of the atomic cooling
haloes with mergers, both minor and/or major, prior to reaching the atomic
cooling limit a requirement. However, the ability of assembling haloes to
remain free of (external) metal enrichment is equally important and underlines
the necessity of following the transport of metals in such simulations. The
candidate DCBH hosting haloes we find, have been exposed to mean Lyman-Werner
radiation fields of J$_{LW}$ $\sim$ 1 J$_{21}$ and typically lie at least 10
kpc (physical) from the nearest massive galaxy. Growth rates of the haloes
reach values of greater than 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$ per unit redshift, leading to
significant dynamical heating and the suppression of efficient cooling until
the halo crosses the atomic cooling threshold. Finally, we also find five
synchronised halo candidates where pairs of pristine atomic cooling haloes
emerge that are both spatially and temporally synchronised.

is thought to yield a quantum error-correcting code. We offer an explicit proof
that this is the case for arbitrary finite groups. Actually a stronger claim is
shown: any two states with zero energy density in some contractible region must
have the same reduced state in that region. Alternatively, the local properties
of a gauge-invariant state are fully determined by specifying that its
holonomies in the region are trivial. We contrast this result with the fact
that local properties of gauge-invariant states are not generally determined by
specifying all of their non-Abelian fluxes -- that is, the Wilson loops of
lattice gauge theory do not form a complete commuting set of observables. We
also note that the methods developed by P. Naaijkens (PhD thesis, 2012) under a
different context can be adapted to provide another proof of the error
correcting property of Kitaev's model. Finally, we compute the topological
entanglement entropy in Kitaev's model, and show, contrary to previous claims

individuals, are fundamental drivers of infectious disease dynamics. Unlike
most periodically-forced physical systems, for which the precise pattern of
forcing is typically known, underlying patterns of seasonal variation in
transmission rates can be estimated approximately at best, and only the period
of forcing is accurately known. Yet solutions of epidemic models depend
strongly on the forcing function, so dynamical predictions---such as changes in
epidemic patterns that can be induced by demographic transitions or mass
vaccination---are always subject to the objection that the underlying patterns
of seasonality are poorly specified. Here, we demonstrate that the key
bifurcations of the standard epidemic model are invariant to the shape of
seasonal forcing if the amplitude of forcing is appropriately adjusted.
Consequently, analyses applicable to real disease dynamics can be conducted
with a smooth, idealized sinusoidal forcing function, and qualitative changes
in epidemic patterns can be predicted without precise knowledge of the
underlying forcing pattern. We find similar invariance in a seasonally forced
predator-prey model, and conjecture that this phenomenon---and the associated
robustness of predictions---might be a feature of many other periodically

characterized by deep uncertainty (i.e., behavior is not well understood or

to reduce damages from rising sea levels. If a prescribed margin of safety does
not properly account for sea-level rise and its uncertainties, the
effectiveness of flood protection will decrease over time, potentially putting
lives and property at greater risk. We develop a flood damage allowance
framework for calculating the height of a flood protection strategy needed to
ensure that a given level of financial risk is maintained (i.e., the average
flood damage in a given year). The damage allowance framework considers
decision-maker preferences such as planning horizons, preferred protection
strategies (storm surge barrier, levee, elevation, and coastal retreat), and
subjective views of AIS stability. We use Manhattan (New York City)\textemdash
with the distribution of buildings, populations, and infrastructure fixed in

calculate a range of damage allowances based on multiple plausible AIS
outcomes. Assumptions regarding future AIS stability more strongly influence
damage allowances under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative
Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5) compared to those that assume strong emissions
reductions (RCP2.6). Design tools that specify financial risk targets, such as
the average flood damage in a given year, allow for the calculation of avoided
flood damages (i.e., benefits) that can be combined with estimates of
construction cost and then integrated into existing financial decision-making

The lateral confinement introduces a splitting of the $d$-orbitals that alters
the orbital energy hierarchy and significantly affects the electron filling
dependence of the topological phase diagram. Due to the orbital directionality
of the $t_{2g}$-states, we find that in the regime of strong confinement the
onset of topological phases is pinned at electron filling where the quasi flat
heavy bands start to get populated. The increase of the nanowire thickness
leads to a changeover from sparse-to-dense distribution of topologically
non-trivial domains which occurs at the cross-over associated to the orbital
population inversion. These findings are corroborated by a detailed analysis of
the most favorable topological superconducting phases in the electron
doping-magnetic field plane highlighting the role of orbital selective
confinement.

breaks with the conventional paradigm of transparency by confining and
collecting light near its creation point with an opaque scintillator and a

particle concentrations in a thin layer near the wall due to a phenomenon known
as turbophoresis. Even at relatively low bulk volume fractions,
particle-particle collisions regulate turbophoresis in a critical way, making
simulations sensitive to collisional effects. Lagrangian tracking of every
particle in the flow can become computationally expensive when the physical
number of particles in the system is large. Artificially reducing the number of
particles in the simulation can mitigate the computational cost. When
particle-particle collisions are an important aspect determining the simulation
outcome, as in the case when turbophoresis plays an active role, simply
reducing the number of particles in the simulation significantly alters the
computed particle statistics. This paper introduces a computational particle
treatment for particle-particle collisions which reproduces the results of a
full simulation with a reduced number of particles. This is accomplished by
artificially enhancing the particle collision radius based on scaling laws for
the collision rates. The proposed method retains the use of deterministic
collision models and is applicable for both low and high Stokes number regimes.

always exhibits population crashes for all choices of parameter values for

questions of how the resulting behaviors depend on the details of the models.
How important are the particular design features codified in the differential

using only conditions that can be verified for explicit systems. Next, we
discard the equations entirely, replacing them with qualitative conditions, and

using photon energies that cover the M-absorption edges of Fe and Ni between 40
to 72 eV. The asymmetry was detected by measuring the reflection of light for
two different orientations of the sample magnetization. Density functional
theory (DFT) wasused to calculate the magneto-optical response of different
magnetic configurations, representing different types of excitations:
long-wavelength magnons, short wavelength magnons, and Stoner excitations. In
the case of Fe, we find that the calculated asymmetry is strongly dependent on
the specific type of magnetic excitation. Our modelling also reveals that
during remagnetization Fe is, to a reasonable approximation, described by
magnons, even though small non-linear contributions could indicate some degree
of Stoner excitations as well. In contrast, we find that the calculated
asymmetry in Ni is rather insensitive to the type of magnetic excitations.
However, there is a weak non-linearity in the relation between asymmetry and
the off-diagonal component of the dielectric tensor, which does not originate
from the modifications of the electronic structure. Our experimental and
theoretical results thus emphasize the need of considering a coupling between
asymmetry and magnetization that may be more complex that a simple linear
relationship. This insight is crucial for the microscopic interpretation of
ultrafast magnetization experiments.

topic of substantial interest in the petroleum industry. Studies have shown
that LS brine injection can increase oil production relative to conventional
high-salinity (HS) brine injection, but contradictory results have also been
reported and an understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. We
have recently developed a steady-state pore network model to simulate oil
recovery by LS brine injection in uniformly wetted pore structures (Watson et
al., Transp. Porous Med. 118, 201-223, 2017). We extend this approach here to
investigate the low-salinity effect (LSE) in heterogeneously wetted media. We
couple a model of capillary force-driven fluid displacement to a novel tracer
algorithm and track the salinity front in the pore network as oil and HS brine
are displaced by injected LS brine. The wettability of the pore structure is
modified in regions where water salinity falls below a critical threshold, and
simulations show that this can have significant consequences for oil recovery.
For networks that contain spanning clusters of both water-wet and oil-wet (OW)
pores prior to flooding, our results demonstrate that the OW pores contain the
only viable source of incremental oil recovery by LS brine injection. Moreover,
we show that a LS-induced increase in microscopic sweep efficiency in the OW
pore fraction is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to guarantee
additional oil production. Simulations suggest that the fraction of OW pores in
the network, the average network connectivity and the initial HS brine
saturation are key factors that can determine the extent of any improvement in
oil recovery in heterogeneously wetted networks following LS brine injection.
This study highlights that the mechanisms of the LSE can be markedly different
in uniformly wetted and non-uniformly wetted porous media.

However, efficient exploitation of statistical dependencies measured by a mean

interesting approach is to only encode visually relevant information and use a
different coding method for ""perceptually insignificant"" regions in the frame,
which can lead to substantial data rate reductions while maintaining visual
quality. In this paper, we introduce a texture analyzer before encoding the
input sequences to identify ""perceptually insignificant"" regions in the frame
using convolutional neural networks. We designed and developed a new scheme
that integrate the texture analyzer into the codec that can largely reduce the
temporal flickering artifact for codec with hierarchical coding structure. The
proposed method is implemented in AV1 codec by introducing a new coding tool
called texture mode, where texture mode is a special inter mode treated at the
encoder, that if texture mode is selected, no inter prediction is performed for
the identified texture regions. Instead, displacement of the entire region is
modeled by just one set of motion parameters. Therefore, only the model
parameters are transmitted to the decoder for reconstructing the texture
regions. Non-texture regions in the frame are coded conventionally. We show
that for many standard test sets, the proposed method achieved significant data

quickly learn generalizations based on large quantities of unlabeled data, and
turn these generalizations into classifications using spontaneous labels, often
including labels not seen before. We apply a state-of-the-art unsupervised
learning algorithm to the noisy and extremely imbalanced xView data set to
train a feature extractor that adapts to several tasks: visual similarity
search that performs well on both common and rare classes; identifying outliers
within a labeled data set; and learning a natural class hierarchy
automatically.

but also undetermined, that is, neither true nor false. To evaluate the
vagueness of set membership among arbitrary vectors and closed linear subspaces
of H, the notion of the entropy of the predicate ""... is an element of ..."" is
introduced in the present paper. Since each closed linear subspace in H
uniquely represents the atomic proposition P about a quantum system, the

that measures the uncertainty about the assignment of truth values to the

pure quantum state change: the process which yields no changes in the
valuational entropies of the propositions (corresponding to the deterministic

valuational entropies (corresponding to the gain or loss of information in a

  Formation",,,,,"q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Atherosclerosis is characterised by the growth of fatty plaques in the inner
(intimal) layer of the artery wall. In mature plaques, vascular smooth muscle
cells (SMCs) are recruited from the adjacent medial layer to deposit a cap of
fibrous collagen over the fatty plaque core. The fibrous cap isolates the
thrombogenic content of the plaque from the bloodstream and prevents the
formation of blood clots that cause myocardial infarction or stroke. Despite
the important protective role of the cap, the mechanisms that regulate cap
formation and maintenance are not well understood. It remains unclear why
certain caps become stable, while others become vulnerable to rupture. We
develop a multiphase PDE model with non-standard boundary conditions to
investigate collagen cap formation by SMCs in response to growth factor signals
from the endothelium. Diffusible platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
stimulates SMC migration, proliferation and collagen degradation, while
diffusible transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$ stimulates SMC collagen
synthesis and inhibits collagen degradation. The model SMCs respond
haptotactically to gradients in the collagen phase and have reduced rates of
migration and proliferation in dense collagenous tissue. The model, which is
parameterised using a range of in vivo and in vitro experimental data,
reproduces several observations from studies of plaque growth in
atherosclerosis-prone mice. Numerical simulations and model analysis
demonstrate that a stable cap can be formed by a relatively small SMC
population and emphasise the critical role of TGF-$\beta$ in effective cap
formation and maintenance. These findings provide unique insight into the
cellular and biochemical mechanisms that may lead to plaque destabilisation and
rupture. This work represents an important step towards the development of a
comprehensive in silico plaque.

even-order derivatives with symmetric coefficients. Schemes constructed within
this framework are tested for diverse model problems with an emphasis on

give stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we explore
a different use of time-delay observables: Under the assumption of a flat
Universe, strong lensing observations can accurately measure the angular
diameter distances to sources $D_S$. The corresponding redshifts of quasars may
be up to $z_S\sim4$ according to the forecast. The high-redshift distances
would sample the Hubble diagram between SNe Ia and CMB,

forecast for the era of LSST. The uncertainty of $D_S$ depends on the redshifts

as runtime and solution quality. For many algorithms used in practice, no
parameter settings admit meaningful worst-case bounds, so the parameters are
made available for the user to tune. Alternatively, parameters may be tuned
implicitly within the proof of a worst-case approximation ratio or runtime
bound. Worst-case instances, however, may be rare or nonexistent in practice. A
growing body of research has demonstrated that data-driven algorithm design can
lead to significant improvements in performance. This approach uses a training
set of problem instances sampled from an unknown, application-specific
distribution and returns a parameter setting with strong average performance on
the training set.
  We provide a broadly applicable theory for deriving generalization guarantees
that bound the difference between the algorithm's average performance over the
training set and its expected performance. Our results apply no matter how the
parameters are tuned, be it via an automated or manual approach. The challenge
is that for many types of algorithms, performance is a volatile function of the
parameters: slightly perturbing the parameters can cause large changes in
behavior. Prior research has proved generalization bounds by employing
case-by-case analyses of greedy algorithms, clustering algorithms, integer
programming algorithms, and selling mechanisms. We uncover a unifying structure
which we use to prove extremely general guarantees, yet we recover the bounds
from prior research. Our guarantees apply whenever an algorithm's performance

activity through asteroseismology. The goal of this work is to investigate the
dependencies of the observed mode frequency variations on the stellar
parameters and whether those are consistent with an activity-related origin. We
select the solar-type oscillators with highest signal-to-noise ratio, in total
75 targets. Using the temporal frequency variations determined in Santos et al.
(2018), we study the relation between those variations and the fundamental
stellar properties. We also compare the observed frequency shifts with
chromospheric and photometric activity indexes, which are only available for a
subset of the sample. We find that frequency shifts increase with increasing
chromospheric activity, which is consistent with an activity-related origin of
the observed frequency shifts. Frequency shifts are also found to increase with
effective temperature, which is in agreement with the theoretical predictions
for the activity-related frequency shifts by Metcalfe et al. (2007). Frequency
shifts are largest for fast rotating and young stars, which is consistent with
those being more active than slower rotators and older stars. Finally, we find
evidence for frequency shifts increasing with stellar metallicity.

crucial to improve the efficiency of and reduce the overall cost, for visual

Planning (CPP) problem is often formulated for these inspection applications
because of the coverage requirement. Traditionally, researchers usually plan
and optimize the viewpoints to capture the surface information first, and then
optimize the path to visit the selected viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a
novel planning method to directly sample and plan the inspection path for a
camera-equipped UAV to acquire visual and geometric information of the target
structures as a video stream setting in complex 3D environment. The proposed
planning method first generates via-points and path primitives around the
target object by using sampling methods based on voxel dilation and
subtraction. A novel Primitive Coverage Graph (PCG) is then proposed to encode
the topological information, flying distances, and visibility information, with
the sampled via-points and path primitives. Finally graph search is performed
to find the resultant path in the PCG to complete the inspection task with the
coverage requirements. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated
through simulation and field tests in this paper.

this work, Janus SnSSe monolayer is predicted by means of first-principles
calculations, which exhibits dynamic and mechanical stability. By using
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the
Janus SnSSe monolayer is found to be an indirect band-gap semiconductor, whose
gap can easily be tuned by strain. High carrier mobilities are obtained for
SnSSe monolayer, and the hole mobility is higher than the electron mobility.
For SnSSe monolayer, a uniaxial strain in the basal plane can induce both
strong in-plane and much weaker out-of-plane piezoelectric polarizations, which
reveals the potential as a piezoelectric two-dimensional (2D) material. The
high absorption coefficients in the visible light region are observed,
suggesting a potential photocatalytic application. Calculated results show that

Programs (CTOP) combines multiple features from its forerunners including
Ground Delay Program (GDP), Airspace Flow Program (AFP) and reroutes, and can

research question in CTOP is how to set traffic flow rates under traffic demand

existing CTOP related stochastic optimization models and point out their roles
in CTOP flow rate planning, and their advantages and disadvantages in terms of
model flexibility, performance, practicality and Collaborative Decision Making
(CDM) software compatibility, etc. CTOP FCA rate planning problem has been
split into two steps: traffic flow rate optimization given demand estimation,
and flow rate adaptation when flight rerouting is considered. Second, we
discuss in detail a class of models called FCA-PCA (Potentially Constrained
Area) models, which are extended from GDP models to solve the first step of the
problem, and were considered promising as they are designed to be consistent
with current CTOP software implementation. We will reveal one inherent
shortcoming suffered by FCA-PCA models and show that how this deficiency can be
addressed by the PCA model family. We will talk about the problems that prevent
stochastic programming being optimal in the second step of the problem. Third,
we discuss the applicability of simulation-based optimization, combine it with
stochastic programming based heuristics and test the resulting new model on a
realistic use case. The results are very encouraging. The models and
discussions in this work are not only useful in more effectively implementing

accurately count retinal ganglion cell axons in images of optic nerve tissue
from various animal models of glaucoma. Methods: The U-Net convolutional neural
network architecture was adapted to learn pixelwise axon count density
estimates, which were then integrated over the image area to determine axon
counts. The tool, termed AxoNet, was trained and evaluated using a dataset
containing images of optic nerve regions randomly selected from complete cross
sections of intact rat optic nerves and manually annotated for axon count and
location. Both control and damaged optic nerves were used. This rat-trained
network was then applied to a separate dataset of non-human primate (NHP) optic
nerve images. AxoNet was then compared to two existing automated axon counting
tools, AxonMaster and AxonJ, using both datasets. Results: AxoNet outperformed
the existing tools on both the rat and NHP optic nerve datasets as judged by
mean absolute error, R2 values when regressing automated vs. manual counts, and
Bland-Altman analysis. Conclusion: The proposed tool allows for accurate
quantification of axon numbers as a measure of glaucomatous damage. AxoNet is
robust to variations in optic nerve tissue damage extent, image quality, and
species of mammal. Significance: The deep learning method does not rely on
hand-crafted image features for axon recognition. Therefore, this approach is
not species-specific and can be extended to quantify additional optic nerve
features. It will aid evaluation of optic nerve changes in glaucoma and
potentially other neurodegenerative diseases.

wandering null geodesic to symbolically discuss its formation. Then we examine
the existence of a wandering null geodesic in general black hole spacetimes

marketing strategy (i.e., the ratio of the strategy's causal effect on some

become increasingly more important. Although randomized ``geo experiments'' are
frequently employed for this evaluation, obtaining reliable estimates of iROAS
can be challenging as oftentimes only a small number of highly heterogeneous
units are used. Moreover, advertisers frequently impose budget constraints on
their ad spends, which further complicates causal inference by introducing
interference between the experimental units. In this paper, we formulate a
novel statistical framework for inferring the iROAS of online advertising from
randomized paired geo experiment which further motivates and provides new
insights into Rosenbaum's arguments on instrumental variables, and we propose

some violations of its assumptions and show that it can be more efficient than
some alternative estimators based on simulated data. We then demonstrate its

techniques, current image captioning systems are able to generate detailed
visual descriptions. For the most part, these descriptions represent an
objective characterisation of the image, although some models do incorporate
subjective aspects related to the observer's view of the image, such as
sentiment; current models, however, usually do not consider the emotional
content of images during the caption generation process. This paper addresses
this issue by proposing novel image captioning models which use facial
expression features to generate image captions. The models generate image
captions using long short-term memory networks applying facial features in
addition to other visual features at different time steps. We compare a
comprehensive collection of image captioning models with and without facial
features using all standard evaluation metrics. The evaluation metrics indicate
that applying facial features with an attention mechanism achieves the best
performance, showing more expressive and more correlated image captions, on an
image caption dataset extracted from the standard Flickr 30K dataset,
consisting of around 11K images containing faces. An analysis of the generated
captions finds that, perhaps unexpectedly, the improvement in caption quality
appears to come not from the addition of adjectives linked to emotional aspects
of the images, but from more variety in the actions described in the captions.

numerical simulations of gravitational collapse of massive stars adopting the

which is in accord with the experimental and observational constraints, and
compare them with the results obtained by using the Shen EOS. Numerical results

emissions demonstrate increasing effects of the symmetry energy at high
densities. Neutrino cooling drastically proceeds in a relatively long timescale
with high luminosities and average energies with the small symmetry energy.
Evolution toward the cold neutron star is affected because of the different

remains similar in less neutron-rich environments.

complex electromagnetic environment. Due to the synthetic high range resolution
in RSRFs, a target usually occupies a series of range cells and is called an
extended target. To reconstruct the range-Doppler information in a RSFR,
previous studies based on sparse recovery mainly exploit the sparsity of the
target scene but do not adequately address the extended-target characteristics,
which exist in many practical applications. Block sparsity, which combines the
sparsity and the target extension, better characterizes a priori knowledge of
the target scene in a wideband RSFR. This paper studies the RSFR range-Doppler
reconstruction problem using block sparse recovery. Particularly, we
theoretically analyze the block coherence and spectral norm of the observation
matrix in RSFR and build a bound on the parameters of the radar, under which
the exact recovery of the range-Doppler information is guaranteed. Both
simulation and field experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the
block sparse recovery over conventional sparse recovery in RSFRs.

multi-pass encoding is usually performed with the rate control mode of the
average bitrate (ABR) or the constant rate factor (CRF) to distribute bits as
reasonably as possible in terms of perceived quality, leading to high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose to utilize the video
information generated during the encoding to adaptively adjust the CRF setting
at GOP level, ensuring the bits of frames in each GOP are allocated reasonably
under the bitrate constraint with a single-pass encoding framework. In
particular, due to the inherent relationship between CRF values and bitrates,
we adopt a shallow neural network (NN) to map video content features to the
CRF-bitrate model. The content-related features are collected from the
lookahead module inside the x265 encoder, including encoding cost estimation,
motion vector and so on. Further, a rate control method, called content
adaptive rate factor (CARF), is proposed to adjust the CRF value of each GOP
with the requirement of the target bitrate by using the predicted CRF-bitrate
models of each GOP. The experimental results show that the proposed approach
can make 84.5\% testing data within 20% bitrate error (or better) and
outperform the ABR mode in x265, leading to 5.23% BD-rate reduction on average.

images, the last few years have seen work on generating visually grounded image
captions which have a specific style (e.g., incorporating positive or negative
sentiment). However, because the stylistic component is typically the last part
of training, current models usually pay more attention to the style at the
expense of accurate content description. In addition, there is a lack of
variability in terms of the stylistic aspects. To address these issues, we
propose an image captioning model called ATTEND-GAN which has two core
components: first, an attention-based caption generator to strongly correlate
different parts of an image with different parts of a caption; and second, an
adversarial training mechanism to assist the caption generator to add diverse
stylistic components to the generated captions. Because of these components,
ATTEND-GAN can generate correlated captions as well as more human-like
variability of stylistic patterns. Our system outperforms the state-of-the-art
as well as a collection of our baseline models. A linguistic analysis of the
generated captions demonstrates that captions generated using ATTEND-GAN have a
wider range of stylistic adjectives and adjective-noun pairs.

We identify the IHSC using an improved phase-space galaxy finder algorithm

definition of this stellar component, that can be applied to halos of arbitrary
masses. We explore the IHSC mass fraction-total halo's stellar mass,
$f_{M*,IHSC}-M*$, relation and the physical drivers of its scatter. We find
that on average the $f_{M*,IHSC}$ increases with $M_{*,tot}$, with the scatter
decreasing strongly with mass from 2 dex at $M_{*,tot}\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ to
0.3 dex at group masses. At high masses, $M_{*,tot}>10^{11.5}M_\odot$,
$f_{M*,IHSC}$ increases with the number of substructures, and with the mass
ratio between the central galaxy and largest satellite, at fixed $M_{*,tot}$.
From mid-size groups and systems below $M_{*,tot}<10^{12}M_\odot$, we find that
the central galaxy's stellar rotation-to-dispersion velocity ratio, V/{\sigma},
displays the strongest (anti)-correlation with $f_{M*,IHSC}$ at fixed
$M_{*,tot}$ of all the galaxy and halo properties explored, transitioning from
$f_{M*,IHSC}$<0.1% for high V/{\sigma}, to $f_{M*,IHSC}\sim5$% for low
V/{\sigma} galaxies. By studying the $f_{M*,IHSC}$ temporal evolution, we find
that, in the former, mergers not always take place, but if they did, they
happened early (z>1), while the high $f_{M*,IHSC}$ population displays a much
more active merger history. In the case of massive groups and galaxy clusters,
$M_{*,tot}>10^{12}M_\odot$, a fraction $f_{M*,IHSC}\sim$10-20% is reached at
$z\sim1$ and then they evolve across lines of constant $f_{M*,IHSC}$ modulo
some small perturbations. Because of the limited simulation's volume, the
latter is only tentative and requires a larger sample of simulated galaxy

semantic relation graph (SRG) to explicitly model the relations among persons.
Then, two agents adopting policy according to two Markov decision processes are
applied to progressively refine the SRG. Specifically, one feature-distilling
(FD) agent in the discrete action space refines the low-level spatio-temporal
features by distilling the most informative frames. Another relation-gating
(RG) agent in continuous action space adjusts the high-level semantic graph to
pay more attention to group-relevant relations. The SRG, FD agent, and RG agent
are optimized alternately to mutually boost the performance of each other.
Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

Here, a global 3D model of the already captured scene parts is reconstructed

navigate in the remote site completely independent of the current position and

teleoperation. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and demonstrate the
capabilities as well as the performance of our system regarding interactive

that the MFPT is linearly dependent on T in the small T limit for all the

stochastic properties of the transport model in question. We also discuss the
relationship between the observation time, T, dependence and the travel-length,

specifically graphene hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures. We
present the hyperbolic dispersion of electromagnetic waves due to anisotropy,
and describe how the spontaneous fluctuations of current in a 2D electronic

show that both the regime of (i) thermal current fluctuations and (ii)
out-of-equilibrium current fluctuations can be described within the framework

(ii) electroluminescent cooling. We discuss a recent experimental investigation

the dependence of band-gap at $L$-valley and $\Gamma$-valley with different Sn

potentially indicating that commonplace processes occurred throughout
comet-forming regions. Through impacts, part of this material has also been
transported to the inner planetary system, including the terrestrial planets.
While comets have been ruled out as a major contributor to terrestrial ocean
water, substantial delivery of volatile species to the Earth's atmosphere, and

Comets contain many species of pre-biotic relevance and molecules that are
related to biological processes on Earth, and have hence been proposed as
potential indicators for the presence of biological processes in the search of

reduces the typically large computational cost associated with maximizing
manipulability when additional constraints exist. Results from simulation
studies and experiments with a real manipulator demonstrate increases in
manipulability, while maintaining smooth trajectories with more dexterous (and
therefore more agile) arm configurations.

properties of simplicial complex networks centrality measures for simplices
need to be proposed. Many of the classical complex networks centralities are
based on the degree of a node, so in order to define degree centrality measures
for simplices (which would characterise the relevance of a simplicial community
in a simplicial network), a different definition of adjacency between simplices
is required. The aim of these notes is threefold: first we will use the
recently introduced notions of higher order simplicial degrees to propose new
degree based centrality measures in simplicial complexes. These theoretical
centrality measures, such as the simplicial degree centrality or the
eigenvector centrality would allow not only to study the relevance of a
simplicial community and the quality of its higher-order connections in a
simplicial network, but also they might help to elucidate topological and
dynamical properties of simplicial networks; sencond, we define notions of
walks and distances in simplicial complexes in order to study connectivity of
simplicial networks and to generalise, to the simplicial case, the well known
closeness and betweenness centralities (needed for instance to study the
relevance of a simplicial community in terms of its ability of transmitting
information); third, we propose a new clustering coefficient for simplices in a
simplicial network, different from the one knows so far and which generalises
the standard graph clustering of a vertex. This measure should be essential to
know the density of a simplicial network in terms of its simplicial
communities.

assumed to be formed after the tidal disruption of a solar type star. This
torus has been shown to be unstable to a global non-axisymmetric hydrodynamic

analytical estimates of the maximum amplitude of the gravitational wave signal,
with the aim to establish its detectability by the Laser Interferometer Space

numerical simulation of the torus, made with a 3D smoothed particle

two orders of magnitude lower than the maximum value obtained analytically.

still be interesting sources for LISA, if we consider discs generated after
deeply penetrating tidal disruptions of main sequence stars of higher mass.

spectroscopic diversity. Extending previous work that focused exclusively on
photometry, we simultaneously model the multi-band light curves and optical
spectra of Type II SNe using RSG progenitors that are characterized by their
H-rich envelope masses or the mass and extent of an enshrouding cocoon at the
star's surface. Reducing the H-rich envelope mass yields faster declining light
curves, a shorter duration of the photospheric phase, broader line profiles at
early times, but only a modest boost in early-time optical brightness.
Increasing the mass of the circumstellar material (CSM) is more effective at
boosting the early-time brightness and producing a fast-declining light curve
while leaving the duration of the photospheric phase intact. It also makes the
optical color bluer, delays the onset of recombination, and can severely reduce
the speed of the fastest ejecta material. The early ejecta interaction with CSM
is conducive to producing featureless spectra at $10-20$ d and a weak or absent
H$\alpha$ absorption during the recombination phase. The slow decliners SNe
1999em, 2012aw, and 2004et can be explained with a $1.2 \times 10^{51}$ erg
explosion in a compact ($\sim$600 R$_\odot$) RSG star from a 15 M$_\odot$
stellar evolution model. A small amount of CSM ($<0.2$ M$_\odot$) improves the
match to the SN photometry at times $<$ 10 d. With more extended RSG
progenitors, one predicts lower ejecta kinetic energies, but the SN color stays
blue for too long and the spectral line widths are too narrow. The fast
decliners SNe 2013ej and 2014G may require $0.5-1.0$ M$_\odot$ of CSM, although
this depends on the CSM structure. A larger boost to the luminosity (as for
fast decliners SNe 1979C or 1998S) requires interaction with a more spatially
extended CSM, which might also be detached from the star.

two-dimensional ensemble of particles interacting via a
Lifshitz-Petrich-Gaussian potential. In particular, analysing structures
described by a commensurate ratio between the two wave numbers that mark the
pattern, the Lifshitz-Petrich-Gaussian boson model may display a stable and
well-defined stripe phase lacking any global phase coherence but featuring a
superfluid signal along the stripe direction only. Upon increasing quantum
fluctuations and quantum-mechanical exchange of bosons, the double-degeneration
of the negative minima in the Fourier transform of the potential is removed at
the expense of a density modulation peculiar to a cluster triangular crystal.
We also show that this last structure possess all features adhering to the

parameters of the iron-pnictogen (Fe$Pn$) layer are similar to those of the
series LaFe(As$_{1-x'}$P$_{x'}$)O, which exhibit two segregated
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order phases, AFM1 at $x'$=0-0.2 and AFM2 at
$x'$=0.4-0.7. Our results revealed that the parent AFM1 phase at $x$=0
disappears at $x$=0.3-0.4, corresponding to a pnictogen height ($h_{pn}$) from
the Fe-plane of 1.3-1.32 \AA, which is similar to that of
LaFe(As$_{1-x'}$P$_{x'}$)O and various parent Fe-pnictides. By contrast, the
AFM2 order reported for LaFe(As$_{0.4}$P$_{0.6}$)O does not appear at
$x\sim$0.8, although the local lattice parameters of the Fe$Pn$ layer and the
microscopic electronic states are quite similar. Despite the absence of the
{\it static} AFM2 order, reemergent {\it dynamical} AFM spin fluctuations were
observed at approximately $x\sim$0.8, which can be attributed to the
instability of the AFM2 phase. We suggest this re-enhancement of AFM spin
fluctuations to play a significant role in enhancing the $T_c$ to 17 K for
$x$=0.8-1. Finally, we discuss the universality and diversity of the
complicated magnetic ground states from a microscopic point of view, including
the difference in the origins of the AFM1 and AFM2 phases, and their relations
with the high superconducting transitions in Fe-pnictides.

angular resolution) observations of the dust continuum emission towards the
archetypal and ongoing accretion burst young stellar object FU Ori, which
simultaneously covered its companion, FU Ori S. In addition, we present
near-infrared (2-2.45 $\mu$m) observations of FU Ori taken with the General
Relativity Analysis via VLT InTerferometrY (GRAVITY; $\sim$1 mas angular

find that the emission in both FU Ori and FU Ori S at (sub)millimeter and near
infrared bands is dominated by structures inward of $\sim$10 au radii. We
detected closure phases close to zero from FU Ori with VLTI/GRAVITY, which
indicate the source is approximately centrally symmetric and therefore is
likely viewed nearly face-on. Our simple model to fit the GRAVITY data shows
that the inner 0.4 au radii of the FU Ori disk has a triangular spectral shape
at 2-2.45 $\mu$m, which is consistent with the H$_{2}$O and CO absorption
features in a $\dot{M}\sim$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$, viscously heated
accretion disk. At larger ($\sim$0.4-10 au) radii, our analysis shows that
viscous heating may also explain the observed (sub)millimeter and centimeter
spectral energy distribution when we assume a constant, $\sim$10$^{-4}$
$M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ mass inflow rate in this region. This explains how the
inner 0.4 au disk is replenished with mass at a modest rate, such that it
neither depletes nor accumulates significant masses over its short dynamic
timescale. Finally, we tentatively detect evidence of vertical dust settling in
the inner 10 au of the FU Ori disk, but confirmation requires more complete
spectral sampling in the centimeter bands.

from unlabeled samples are mainly focused on consistency regularization methods
that encourage invariant predictions for different perturbations of unlabeled

soft pseudo-labels using the network predictions. We show that a naive

techniques for reducing it. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art

recently proposed that these transrelativistic probes can be used to study
astronomical objects and to test special relativity. In this work, we further
propose some methods to test special relativity and constrain photon mass using
the Doppler effect with the images and spectral features of astronomical
objects as observed in the transrelativistic probes. We introduce more general
theories to set up the framework of testing special relativity, including a
parametric general Doppler effect and Doppler effect with massive photon. We
find that by comparing the spectra of a certain astronomical object, one can
test Lorentz invariance and constrain photon mass. Besides, using imaging and
spectrograph capabilities of transrelativistic probes, one can test time
dilation and constrain photon mass. For a transrelativistic probe with velocity
$v\sim0.2c$, aperture $D\sim3.5~{\rm cm}$ and spectral resolution $R\sim100$
(or $1000$), we find that the probe velocity uncertainty can be constrained to
$\sigma_v\sim0.01c$ (or $0.001c$), and the time dilation factor uncertainty can
be constrained to $\Delta\gamma=|\hat\gamma-\gamma|\lesssim0.01$ (or $0.001$),
where $\hat\gamma$ is the time dilation factor and $\gamma$ is the Lorentz

is created, to be used for generating two test programs, for testing the
control and the data paths respectively. For testing the control part, a novel
high-level control fault model is proposed. Using this model, a set of
deterministic test data operands are generated for each instruction of the

proportionality, which guarantees that each agent receives 1/n of the cake.
Both properties are satisfied by the leftmost leaves mechanism, an adaptation
of the Dubins - Spanier moving knife procedure. Most other classical
proportional mechanisms in literature are obviously manipulable, including the
original moving knife mechanism. Non-obvious manipulability explains why
leftmost leaves is manipulated less often in practice than other proportional
mechanisms.

ConvNet structure for various image restoration applications. However, why the

to DIP in our extensive experiments, and these results would help us for
reinterpreting/characterizing the DIP from a perspective of ``low-dimensional

becoming popular due to its remarkable accuracy when trained with a massive
amount of data, such as generated by IoT. However, DL algorithms tend to leak
privacy when trained on highly sensitive crowd-sourced data such as medical
data. Existing privacy-preserving DL algorithms rely on the traditional
server-centric approaches requiring high processing powers. We propose a new
local differentially private (LDP) algorithm named LATENT that redesigns the
training process. LATENT enables a data owner to add a randomization layer
before data leave the data owners' devices and reach a potentially untrusted
machine learning service. This feature is achieved by splitting the
architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) into three layers: (1)
convolutional module, (2) randomization module, and (3) fully connected module.
Hence, the randomization module can operate as an NFV privacy preservation
service in an SDN-controlled NFV, making LATENT more practical for IoT-driven
cloud-based environments compared to existing approaches. The randomization
module employs a newly proposed LDP protocol named utility enhancing
randomization, which allows LATENT to maintain high utility compared to
existing LDP protocols. Our experimental evaluation of LATENT on convolutional
deep neural networks demonstrates excellent accuracy (e.g. 91%- 96%) with high
model quality even under low privacy budgets (e.g. $\varepsilon=0.5$).

work proposes an entirely visual approach to coordinate markerless drone swarms
based on imitation learning. Each agent is controlled by a small and efficient
convolutional neural network that takes raw omnidirectional images as inputs
and predicts 3D velocity commands that match those computed by a flocking
algorithm. We start training in simulation and propose a simple yet effective
unsupervised domain adaptation approach to transfer the learned controller to
the real world. We further train the controller with data collected in our
motion capture hall. We show that the convolutional neural network trained on
the visual inputs of the drone can learn not only robust inter-agent collision
avoidance but also cohesion of the swarm in a sample-efficient manner. The
neural controller effectively learns to localize other agents in the visual
input, which we show by visualizing the regions with the most influence on the
motion of an agent. We remove the dependence on sharing positions among swarm
members by taking only local visual information into account for control. Our
work can therefore be seen as the first step towards a fully decentralized,
vision-based swarm without the need for communication or visual markers.

a pattern drawn from a random distribution where class membership correlates

with relatively rapid decline in the light curves (Delta m15(B) = 1.36 +- 0.02
mag) and the short rise time (15.37 +- 0.55 days). The Si II 6355 velocity,
associated with a photospheric component but not with a detached high-velocity
feature, reached ~ 20,000 km s-1 at 12 days before the B-band maximum. The line
velocity however decreased very rapidly and smoothly toward the maximum light,
where it was ~ 13,000 km s-1 as relatively low among HV SNe. This indicates
that the speed of the spectral evolution of HV SNe Ia is correlated not only to
the velocity at the maximum light, but also to the light curve decline rate
like the case for Normal-Velocity (NV) SNe Ia. Spectral synthesis modeling
shows that the outermost layer at > 17,000 km s-1 is well described by the
O-Ne-C burning layer extending to at least 25,000 km s-1, and there is no
unburnt carbon below 30,000 km s-1; these properties are largely consistent
with the delayed detonation scenario, and are shared with the prototypical HV
SN 2002bo despite the large difference in Delta m15(B). This structure is
strikingly different from that derived for the well-studied NV SN 2011fe. We
suggest that the relation between the mass of 56Ni (or Delta m15) and the
extent of the O-Ne-C burning layer provides an important constraint on the

  volatility term structure","33 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables",,,,"q-fin.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomalous diffusions arise as scaling limits of continuous-time random walks
(CTRWs) whose innovation times are distributed according to a power law. The
impact of a non-exponential waiting time does not vanish with time and leads to
different distribution spread rates compared to standard models. In financial
modelling this has been used to accommodate for random trade duration in the
tick-by-tick price process. We show here that anomalous diffusions are able to
reproduce the market behaviour of the implied volatility more consistently than
usual L\'evy or stochastic volatility models. We focus on two distinct classes
of underlying asset models, one with independent price innovations and waiting
times, and one allowing dependence between these two components. These two
models capture the well-known paradigm according to which shorter trade
duration is associated with higher return impact of individual trades. We fully
describe these processes in a semimartingale setting leading no-arbitrage
pricing formulae, and study their statistical properties. We observe that
skewness and kurtosis of the asset returns do not tend to zero as time goes by.
We also characterize the large-maturity asymptotics of Call option prices, and
find that the convergence rate is slower than in standard L\'evy regimes, which
in turn yields a declining implied volatility term structure and a slower decay
of the skew.

In non-cyclic evolutions, a proposition relates the geometric phase to the area

remained elusive for more than three decades. Here, we report an unambiguous
experimental confirmation of the geodesic rule for a non-cyclic geometric phase

high precision, the predicted phase sign change and pi jumps. We show the

A manifest contract system is a typed functional calculus in which software
contracts are integrated into a refinement type system and consistency of
contracts is checked by combination of compile- and run-time type checking.
Intersection types naturally arise when a contract is expressed by a
conjunction of smaller contracts. Run-time contract checking for conjunctive
higher-order contracts in an untyped language has been studied but our typed
setting poses an additional challenge due to the fact that an expression of an
intersection type $\tau_1 \wedge \tau_2$ may have to perform different run-time
checking whether it is used as $\tau_1$ or $\tau_2$. We build PCFv$\Delta$H on
top of the $\Delta$-calculus, a Church-style intersection type system by
Liquori and Stolze. In the $\Delta$-calculus, a canonical expression of an
intersection type is a strong pair, whose elements are the same expressions
except for type annotations. To address the challenge above, we relax strong
pairs so that expressions in a pair are the same except for type annotations
and casts, which are a construct for run-time checking. We give a formal
definition of PCFv$\Delta$H and show its basic properties as a manifest
contract system: preservation, progress, and value inversion. Furthermore, we
show that run-time checking does not affect essential computation.

optimal result for the case environmental noises act on the strain channel

CLEAR generates w-counterfactual explanations that state minimum changes
necessary to flip a prediction's classification. CLEAR then builds local
regression models, using the w-counterfactuals to measure and improve the
fidelity of its regressions. By contrast, the popular LIME method, which also
uses regression to generate local explanations, neither measures its own
fidelity nor generates counterfactuals. CLEAR's regressions are found to have
significantly higher fidelity than LIME's, averaging over 45% higher in this

are FAST (Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope), BINGO (Baryon
acoustic oscillations In Neutral Gas Observations), and SKA-I (Square Kilometre
Array phase I) single-dish experiment. We also forecast the combined
constraints of the three radio telescopes with Planck. We find that, the $1
\sigma$ errors of $(w_{0}, w_{a})$ for BINGO, FAST and SKA-I with respect to
the fiducial values are respectively, $(0.9293, 3.5792), (0.4083, 1.5878),
(0.3158, 0.4622)$. This is equivalent to $(56.04\%, 55.64\%)$ and $(66.02\%,
87.09\%)$ improvements in constraining $(w_{0}, w_{a})$ for FAST and SKA-I
relative to BINGO. Simulations further show that SKA-I will put more stringent
constraints than both FAST and BINGO when each of the experiment is combined
with Planck measurement. For the $9$ cosmological parameters in consideration,
we find that, there is a trade-off between SKA-I and FAST in constraining
cosmological parameters, with each experiment being more superior in
constraining a particular set of parameters.

physics required to completely describe stars at effective temperatures

makes available large datasets to determine the nature and extent of this
effect. We employ an all-sky sample, comprising of $>$15\,000 stars, to
determine empirical relationships between luminosity, temperature and radius.
This is accomplished using only geometric distances and multiwave-band
photometry, by utilising a modified spectral energy distribution fitting
method. The radii we measure show an inflation of $3 - 7\%$ compared to models,
but no more than a $1 - 2\%$ intrinsic spread in the inflated sequence. We show
that we are currently able to determine M-dwarf radii to an accuracy of $2.4\%$
using our method. However, we determine that this is limited by the precision
of metallicity measurements, which contribute $1.7\%$ to the measured radius
scatter. We also present evidence that stellar magnetism is currently unable to
explain radius inflation in M-dwarfs.

noise of this pulsar is very close to a sinusoid, with a period of
approximately $31$ years. The main results of this work are (1) The clock of
PSR J1939+2134 is stable at the level of almost one part in $10^{15}$ over
about $31$ years, (2) the power law index of the spectrum of electron density
fluctuations in the direction of PSR J1939+2134 is $3.86 \pm 0.04$, (3) a Moon

astronomical units and eccentricity $\approx 0.2$, can explain the timing noise
of PSR J1939+2134, (4) Precession under electromagnetic torque with very small

to model multi-label data, as rules are interpretable and can be comprehended,
analyzed, or qualitatively evaluated by domain experts. Many rule learning
algorithms employ a heuristic-guided search for rules that model regularities
contained in the training data and it is commonly accepted that the choice of
the heuristic has a significant impact on the predictive performance of the
learner. Whereas the properties of rule learning heuristics have been studied
in the realm of single-label classification, there is no such work taking into
account the particularities of multi-label classification. This is surprising,
as the quality of multi-label predictions is usually assessed in terms of a
variety of different, potentially competing, performance measures that cannot
all be optimized by a single learner at the same time. In this work, we show
empirically that it is crucial to trade off the consistency and coverage of
rules differently, depending on which multi-label measure should be optimized
by a model. Based on these findings, we emphasize the need for configurable
learners that can flexibly use different heuristics. As our experiments reveal,
the choice of the heuristic is not straight-forward, because a search for rules
that optimize a measure locally does usually not result in a model that
maximizes that measure globally.

onto a crystal with a non-linear optical response was used to test quantum

was enabled by the emergence of single photon sensitive cameras able to
characterize spatial correlations and high-dimensional entanglement. Thereby
new techniques emerged such as the ghost imaging of objects - where the quantum
correlations between photons reveal the image from photons that have never
interacted with the object - or the imaging with undetected photons by using
nonlinear interferometers. Additionally, quantum approaches in imaging can also
lead to an improvement in the performance of conventional imaging systems.
These improvements can be obtained by means of image contrast, resolution
enhancement that exceed the classical limit and acquisition of sub-shot noise
phase or amplitude images. In this review we discuss the application of quantum

However, they still face many problems in practical application such as reduced
speed to ascertain their collaborativeness. The standards prescribe two
regimes: (i) speed and separation monitoring and (ii) power and force limiting,
where the former requires reliable estimation of distances between the robot
and human body parts and the latter imposes constraints on the energy absorbed
during collisions prior to robot stopping. Following the standards, we deploy
the two collaborative regimes in a single application and study the performance
in a mock collaborative task under the individual regimes, including
transitions between them. Additionally, we compare the performance under
""safety zone monitoring"" with keypoint pair-wise separation distance assessment
relying on an RGB-D sensor and skeleton extraction algorithm to track human
body parts in the workspace. Best performance has been achieved in the
following setting: robot operates at full speed until a distance threshold
between any robot and human body part is crossed; then, reduced robot speed per
power and force limiting is triggered. Robot is halted only when the operator's
head crosses a predefined distance from selected robot parts. We demonstrate
our methodology on a setup combining a KUKA LBR iiwa robot, Intel RealSense
RGB-D sensor and OpenPose for human pose estimation.

aims to replace or modify a word in the source image with another one while
maintaining its realistic look. This task is challenging, as the styles of both
background and text need to be preserved so that the edited image is visually
indistinguishable from the source image. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end
trainable style retention network (SRNet) that consists of three modules: text
conversion module, background inpainting module and fusion module. The text
conversion module changes the text content of the source image into the target
text while keeping the original text style. The background inpainting module
erases the original text, and fills the text region with appropriate texture.
The fusion module combines the information from the two former modules, and
generates the edited text images. To our knowledge, this work is the first
attempt to edit text in natural images at the word level. Both visual effects
and quantitative results on synthetic and real-world dataset (ICDAR 2013) fully
confirm the importance and necessity of modular decomposition. We also conduct
extensive experiments to validate the usefulness of our method in various

In most canonical shear flows, the laminar flow is linearly stable and a
finite-amplitude perturbation is necessary to trigger transition. Controlling
transition to turbulence is achieved via the broadening or narrowing of the
basin of attraction of the laminar flow. In this paper, a novel methodology to
assess the robustness of the laminar flow and the efficiency of control
strategies is introduced. It relies on the statistical sampling of the phase
space neighborhood around the laminar flow in order to assess the transition
probability of perturbations as a function of their energy. This approach is
applied to a canonical flow (plane Couette flow) and provides invaluable
insight: in the presence of the chosen control, transition is significantly
suppressed whereas plausible scalar indicators of the nonlinear stability of
the flow, such as the edge state energy, do not provide conclusive predictions.
The methodology presented here in the context of transition to turbulence is
applicable to any nonlinear system displaying finite-amplitude instability.

far, an unexplored avenue is that related to the inverse DFT problem. DFT is
based on the one-to-one correspondence between Kohn-Sham (KS) potentials and
densities. The exact EDF produces the exact density, so that from the knowledge
of experimental or {\it ab initio} densities one may deduce useful information

irregularities in particular spectra was used to constrain ALP parameters, with
two most popular sources being the radio galaxy NGC 1275 and the blazar PKS
2155-304. The effect and, consequently, the constraints, depend on the magnetic
fields through which the light from the source is propagated. Here, we revisit
ALP constraints from gamma-ray observations of NGC 1275 taking into account the
regular magnetic field of the X-ray cavity observed around this radio galaxy.
This field was not accounted for in previous studies, which assumed a model of
purely turbulent fields with coherence length much smaller than the cavity
size. For the purely regular field, ALP constraints are relaxed considerably,
compared to the purely turbulent one. While the actual magnetic field around a
source is an unknown sum of the turbulent and ordered components, the
difference in results gives an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty of the
study and calls for detailed measurements of magnetic fields around sources
used to constrain ALP properties in this approach.

transverse velocity perturbation is introduced into a complex magnetic field.
We analysed the deformation of the wave fronts as the perturbation propagates
through the braided magnetic structures and explore the nature of Alfv\'enic
wave phase mixing in this regime. Spatial gradients in the local Alfv\'en speed
and variations in the length of magnetic field lines ensure that small scales
form throughout the propagating wave front due to phase mixing. Additionally,
the presence of complex, intricate current sheets associated with the
background field locally modifies the polarisation of the wave front. The
combination of these two effects enhances the rate of viscous dissipation,
particularly in more complex field configurations. Unlike in classical phase
mixing configurations, the greater spatial extent of Alfv\'en speed gradients
ensures that wave energy is deposited over a larger cross-section of the
magnetic structure. Further, the complexity of the background magnetic field
ensures that small gradients in a wave driver can map to large gradients within
the coronal plasma. The phase mixing of MHD waves in a complex magnetic field
will progress throughout the braided volume. As a result, in a non-ideal regime
wave energy will be dissipated over a greater cross-section than in classical
phase mixing models. The formation rate of small spatial scales in a
propagating wave front is a function of the complexity of the background
magnetic field. As such, if the coronal field is sufficiently complex it
remains plausible that phase mixing induced wave heating can contribute to
maintaining observed temperatures. Furthermore, the weak compressibility of the
transverse wave and the observed phase mixing pattern may provide seismological
information about the nature of the background plasma.

portrait segmentation has its unique requirements. First, because the portrait
segmentation is performed in the middle of a whole process of many realworld
applications, it requires extremely lightweight models. Second, there has not
been any public datasets in this domain that contain a sufficient number of

elastic scatterers where the length of the free flights is unbounded (the
infinite-horizon Lorentz gas, LG). The Bleher central limit theorem (CLT)
states that the distribution of the particle displacement divided by
$\sqrt{t\ln t}$ is Gaussian in the limit of infinite time $t$. However it was
stressed recently that the slow convergence makes this result unobservable.
Using a L\'{e}vy walk model (LW) of the LG, it was proposed that the use of a
rescaled Lambert function instead of $\sqrt{t\ln t}$ provides a fast
convergent, observable CLT, which was confirmed by the LG simulations. We
demonstrate here that this result can simplified to a mixed CLT where the
scaling factor combines normal and anomalous diffusions. For narrow infinite
corridors the particle for long time obeys the usual normal diffusion, which
explains the previous numerical observations. In the opposite limit of small
scatterers the Bleher CLT gives a good guiding. In the intermediate cases the
mixed CLT applies. The Gaussian peak determines moments of order smaller than
two. In contrast, the CLT gives only half the coordinate dispersion. The
missing half of the dispersion and also moments of order higher than two are
described by the distribution's tail (the infinite density) which we derive
here. The tail is supported along the infinite corridors and formed by
anomalously long flights whose duration is comparable with the whole time of
observation. The moments' calculation from the tail is confirmed by direct
calculation of the fourth moment from the statistics of the backward recurrence
time defined as time that elapsed since the last collision. This completes the
solution of the LW model allowing full comparison with the LG.

agreed to the deployment and operation of VERITAS-SII during several days each
month around the full moon period when VERITAS does not perform VHE gamma-ray
observations. The VERITAS-SII augmentation employs custom high-speed/low-noise
focal plane instrumentation using high quantum efficiency photomultiplier
tubes, and a battery-powered, fiber-optic controlled High Voltage supply. To
reduce engineering time, VERITAS-SII uses commercially available high-speed
(250 MS/sec), continuously streaming electronics to record the time dependence
of the intensity fluctuations at each VERITAS telescope. VERITAS-SII also uses
fast ( < 100 psec) data acquisition clock synchronization over inter-telescope
distances (greater than 100 m) using a commercially available White Rabbit
based timing solution. VERITAS-SII is now in full operation at the VERITAS
observatory, F.L.Whipple Observatory, Amado, AZ USA. This paper describes the
design of the instrumentation hardware used for VERITAS-SII augmentation of the
VERITAS observatory, the status of initial VERITAS-SII observations, and plans
for future improvements to VERITAS-SII.

(SPPs) can be formed, where the QE is partially stabilized in its excited
state. We put forward a general approach for calculating the energy level shift
at a negative frequency $\omega$, which is just the negative of the nonresonant
part for the energy level shift at positive frequency $-\omega$. We also
propose an efficient formalism for obtaining the long-time value of the
excited-state population without calculating the eigenfrequency of the bound
state or performing a time evolution of the system, in which the probability
amplitude for the excited state in the steady limit is equal to one minus the
integral of the evolution spectrum over the positive frequency range. With the
above two quantities obtained, we show that the non-Markovian decay dynamics in
the presence of a bound state can be obtained by the method based on the
Green's function expression for the evolution operator. A general criterion for
identifying the existence of a bound state is presented. These are numerically
demonstrated for a QE located around a nanosphere and in a gap plasmonic
nanocavity. These findings are instructive in the fields of coherent
light-matter interactions.

in statistics and machine learning. Nonetheless, the development of the
existing VB algorithms is so far generally restricted to the case where the
variational parameter space is Euclidean, which hinders the potential broad
application of VB methods. This paper extends the scope of VB to the case where
the variational parameter space is a Riemannian manifold. We develop an
efficient manifold-based VB algorithm that exploits both the geometric
structure of the constraint parameter space and the information geometry of the
manifold of VB approximating probability distributions. Our algorithm is
provably convergent and achieves a convergence rate of order $\mathcal
O(1/\sqrt{T})$ and $\mathcal O(1/T^{2-2\epsilon})$ for a non-convex evidence
lower bound function and a strongly retraction-convex evidence lower bound
function, respectively. We develop in particular two manifold VB algorithms,
Manifold Gaussian VB and Manifold Neural Net VB, and demonstrate through
numerical experiments that the proposed algorithms are stable, less sensitive
to initialization and compares favourably to existing VB methods.

(GW) standard siren observation by the Einstein Telescope (ET) on constraining
the interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We simulate 1000 GW events in the
redshift range of $0\lesssim z \lesssim 5$ based on the 10-year observation of
the ET. We combine the simulated GW data with the current mainstream
cosmological electromagnetic observations including the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies, the baryon acoustic oscillations, and the type Ia
supernovae to constrain the IDE models. We consider typical IDE models in the
context of a perturbed universe. To avoid the large-scale instability problem
for IDE models, we apply the extended parameterized post-Friedmann approach to
calculate the cosmological perturbations. We find that the addition of the GW
standard siren data could significantly improve the constraint accuracies for
most of the cosmological parameters (e.g., $H_{0}$, $w$, and $\Omega_{\rm m}$).
For the coupling parameter $\beta$, the constraint errors could also be
slightly improved when adding the GW data in the cosmological fit.

gradients. Here, we show that for an inhomogeneous magnetic field these
nondiffusive fluxes have finite divergence and therefore affect the density
evolution of the system. Only in the special cases of a uniform magnetic field
or carefully chosen initial condition with the same symmetry as the magnetic
field can these fluxes be ignored in the density evolution.

chatbots to robots, human experience in the developed world is moving towards a

increasingly blurred distinctions between. Given that emotion is a key element
of human interaction, enabling artificial agents with the ability to reason
about affect is a key stepping stone towards a future in which technological
agents and humans can work together. This paper presents work on building
intelligent computational agents that integrate both emotion and cognition.
These agents are grounded in the well-established social-psychological Bayesian
Affect Control Theory (BayesAct). The core idea of BayesAct is that humans are
motivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: they strive for
their social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their
sense of identity and general world views as constructed through culturally
shared symbols. This affective alignment creates cohesive bonds between group
members, and is instrumental for collaborations to solidify as relational group
commitments. BayesAct agents are motivated in their social interactions by a
combination of affective alignment and decision theoretic reasoning, trading
the two off as a function of the uncertainty or unpredictability of the
situation. This paper provides a high-level view of dual process theories and
advances BayesAct as a plausible, computationally tractable model based in
social-psychological theory. We introduce a revised BayesAct model that more
deeply integrates social-psychological theorising, and we demonstrate a
component of the model as being sufficient to account for cognitive biases
about fairness, dissonance and conformity. We show how the model can unify
different exploration strategies in reinforcement learning.

processes. They are key tools in quantifying the relative contribution of

on high impact atmospheric variables like heavy rainfall. These so-called
climate extreme event attribution problems are particularly challenging in a
multivariate context, that is, when the atmospheric variables are measured on a

  In this paper, we leverage two statistical theories to assess causality in
the context of multivariate extreme event attribution. As we consider an event
to be extreme when at least one of the components of the vector of interest is
large, extreme-value theory justifies, in an asymptotical sense, a multivariate
generalized Pareto distribution to model joint extremes. Under this class of
distributions, we derive and study probabilities of necessary and sufficient
causation as defined by the counterfactual theory of Pearl. To increase causal
evidence, we propose a dimension reduction strategy based on the optimal linear
projection that maximizes such causation probabilities. Our approach is tested
on simulated examples and applied to weekly winter maxima precipitation outputs

Refinement which is unique in conserving both linear and angular momentum to
machine precision. To face the challenge of increasingly complex, diverse, and
heterogeneous HPC systems, Octo-Tiger relies on high-level programming
abstractions.
  We use HPX with its futurization capabilities to ensure scalability both
between nodes and within, and present first results replacing MPI with
libfabric achieving up to a 2.8x speedup. We extend Octo-Tiger to heterogeneous
GPU-accelerated supercomputers, demonstrating node-level performance and
portability. We show scalability up to full system runs on Piz Daint. For the
scenario's maximum resolution, the compute-critical parts (hydrodynamics and
gravity) achieve 68.1% parallel efficiency at 2048 nodes.

may originate from the stopping of the migration of Io near the bump in the

Ganymede. The formation mechanism of the bump near the orbit of the innermost

the circumjovian disk could stop the inward migration of dust particles near
the orbit of Io. The resulting dust depleted inner region would have a higher
ionization fraction, and thus admit increased
magnetorotational-instability-driven accretion stress than the outer region.
The increase of the accretion stress at the photophoretic dust barrier would
form a bump in the surface density distribution, halting the migration of Io.

DeepClean; a prototype self-supervised artefact detection system using a
convolutional variational autoencoder deep neural network that avoids costly

for training. For a test case with invasive arterial blood pressure, we
demonstrate that our algorithm can detect the presence of an artefact within a
10-second sample of data with sensitivity and specificity around 90%.
Furthermore, DeepClean was able to identify regions of artefact within such
samples with high accuracy and we show that it significantly outperforms a
baseline principle component analysis approach in both signal reconstruction
and artefact detection. DeepClean learns a generative model and therefore may
also be used for imputation of missing data.

capability in the near-infrared with masking interferometry on NIRISS, and

interferometry complements these observing modes, probing for companions at

  Our goal is to derive both theoretical and operational contrast detection
limits for the kernel-phase analysis of JWST NIRISS full-pupil observations by
using tools from hypothesis testing theory, applied to observations of faint
brown dwarfs with this instrument, but the tools and methods introduced here
are applicable in a wide variety of contexts.
  We construct a statistically independent set of observables from
aberration-robust kernel phases. Three detection tests based on these
observable quantities are designed and analysed, all guaranteeing a constant
false alarm rate for small phase aberrations. One of these tests, the
Likelihood Ratio or Neyman-Pearson test, provides a theoretical performance
bound for any detection test.
  The operational detection method considered here is shown to exhibit only
marginal power loss with respect to the theoretical bound. In principle, for
the test set to a false alarm probability of 1%, companion at contrasts
reaching 10^3 at separations of 200 mas around objects of magnitude 14.1 are
detectable. With JWST NIRISS, contrasts of up to 10^4 at separations of 200 mas
could be ultimately achieved, barring significant wavefront drift.
  The proposed detection method is close to the ultimate bound and offers
guarantees over the probability of making a false detection for binaries, as
well as over the error bars for the estimated parameters of the binaries
detectable by JWST NIRISS. This method is not only applicable to JWST NIRISS
but to any imaging system with adequate sampling.

charged drop, predominantly in a direction opposite to that of gravity. In a
first of its kind of study, we capture the successive events of the droplet
deformation, breakup and relaxation of the drop after jet ejection using high
speed imaging at a couple of hundred thousand frames per second. A pertinent
question of the effect of the electrodynamic trap parameters such as applied
voltage as well as physical parameters such as the size of the drop, gravity
and conductivity on the characteristics of droplet breakup is also explored. A
clear effect of the trap strength on the deformation (both symmetric and
asymmetric) is observed. Moreover, the cone angle at the pole undergoing
asymmetric breakup is almost independent of the applied field investigated in
the experiments. All the experimental observations are compared with numerical
simulations carried out using the boundary element method (BEM) in the Stokes
flow limit. The BEM simulations are also extended to other experimentally
achievable parameters. It is observed that the breakup is mostly field
influenced, and not field induced. A plausible theory for the observations is
reported, and a sensitive role of the sign of the charge on the droplet and the

simulations, as the cause of these modes may not be replicated in these simpler
environments. To this end, we develop a multivariate linear least squares model
with Tikhonov regularization to estimate the 2D temperature spatial field. Our
model uses a Fourier expansion in the circumferential direction and a quadratic
polynomial expansion in the radial direction. One important component of our
modeling framework is the selection of model parameters, i.e. the harmonics in
the circumferential direction. A training-testing paradigm is proposed and
applied to quantify the harmonics.

grasping problem using 2.5D images as the only source of information. In
particular, we developed a simulated environment where a robot equipped with a
vacuum gripper has the aim of reaching blocks with planar surfaces. These
blocks can have different dimensions, shapes, position and orientation. Unity
3D allowed us to simulate a real-world setup, where a depth camera is placed in
a fixed position and the stream of images is used by our policy network to
learn how to solve the task. We explored different DRL algorithms and problem
configurations. The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
DRL algorithm applied to grasp tasks guided by visual depth camera inputs. When
using the proper policy, the proposed method estimates a robot tool
configuration that reaches the object surface with negligible position and
orientation errors. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful
attempt of using 2.5D images only as of the input of a DRL algorithm, to solve
the grasping problem regressing 3D world coordinates.

solutions $v\in C^\theta$ of the Euler equations, in the case $\theta<1/3$. It
is known that convex integration schemes produce wild weak solutions that
exhibit anomalous dissipation of the kinetic energy $e_v$. We show that those
solutions are typical in the Baire category sense. From \cite{Is15}, it is know
that the kinetic energy $e_v$ of $\theta$-H\""older continuous weak solution $v$
of the Euler equations satisfy $ e_v\in C^{\frac{2\theta}{1-\theta}}$. As a
first result we prove that solutions with that behavior are a residual set in
suitable complete metric space $X_\theta$, that is contained in the space of
all $C^\theta$ weak solutions, whose choice is discussed at the end of the
paper. More precisely we show that the set of solutions $v\in X_\theta$ with
$e_v \in C^{\frac{2\theta}{1-\theta}}$ but not to $\bigcup_{p\ge

partially solves [9, Conjecture 1]. We also show that smooth solutions form a
nowhere dense set in the space of all the $C^\theta$ weak solutions. The
technique is the same and what really distinguishes the two cases is that in
the latter there is no need to introduce a different complete metric space with

Some examples of supermassive black holes in the central regions of high
redshift galaxies say that the concerned supermassive black holes have
completed their constructions in a time less than it generally should be. To
justify such discrepancies, we are forced to model about existences of black
hole mimickers and exotic phenomena acting near the supermassive black holes.
Motivated by these we study the natures of exotic matters, especially dark
energy near the black holes. We choose modified Chaplygin gas as dark energy
candidate. Again, the descriptions of gravitational waves or the attenuations
of them when they are tunnelling through cosmological distances help us to
measure the shear viscosity of the medium through which the waves have been
travelled. Delayed decaying models of dark matters also suggest that dark
energy and viscosity may come up as a byproduct of such decays or interactions.
We consider the viscous nature of the medium, i.e., the dark energy. To do so,
we choose an alpha-disc model as proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev. We study the
variations of densities through accretion and wind branches for a different
amount of viscosity regulated by the Shakura-Sunyaev's alpha parameter, spin
parameter and different properties of accreting fluids, viz, the properties of
adiabatic fluid and modified Chaplygin gas. We compare these results with each
other and some existing density profiles drawn from observational data-based
simulations. We follow that our result supports the data observed till date.
Specifically, we see the wind to get stronger for dark energy as accreting
agent. Besides, we see the accretion to have a threshold drop if the viscosity
is chosen along with the repulsive effects of dark energy.

requirements. This work tries to expand the notion of DD in BCN to incorporate
a larger number of systems deemed unsuitable for DD. The methods available are
further restrictive in the sense that system is forced to follow trajectory
unaffected by the disturbances rather than decoupling disturbances while the
system follows its natural course. Some sufficient conditions are provided
under which the problem can be addressed. This work tries to establish the
notion of disturbance decoupling via feedback control,analogous to the
classical control theory. This approach though, is not limited to DD problems
and can be extended to the general control problems of BCNs. Determination of
observability, which is sufficient for the fault detection, is proven to be
NP-hard for Boolean Control Network. Algorithms based on reconstructability, a
necessary condition, of BCN turn out to be of exponential complexity in
general.In such cases it makes sense to search for the availability of some
special structure in BCN that could be utilized for fault detection with
minimal computational efforts. An attempt is made to address this problem by
introducing instantaneous fault detection (IFD) and providing necessary and

survey conducted by Statistics Poland, which involves the inclusion of skills
obtained from online job advertisements. The main goal is to provide estimates
of the demand for skills (competences), which is missing in the DL survey. To
achieve this, we apply a data integration approach combining traditional
calibration with the LASSO-assisted approach to correct representation error in
the online data. Faced with the lack of access to unit-level data from the DL
survey, we use estimated population totals and propose a~bootstrap approach
that accounts for the uncertainty of totals reported by Statistics Poland. We
show that the calibration estimator assisted with LASSO outperforms traditional
calibration in terms of standard errors and reduces representation bias in
skills observed in online job ads. Our empirical results show that online data
significantly overestimate interpersonal, managerial and self-organization
skills while underestimating technical and physical skills. This is mainly due
to the under-representation of occupations categorised as Craft and Related
Trades Workers and Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers.

increase the energy use of automated electric vehicles (AEVs) relative to
human-driven electric vehicles (EVs), although this increase may be offset by
smoother driving. We use a vehicle dynamics model to show that automation is
likely to impose a minor penalty on EV range and have negligible effect on
battery longevity. As such, while some commentators have suggested that the
power and energy requirements of automation mean that the first automated
vehicles (AVs) will be gas-electric hybrids, we conclude that this need not be
the case. We also find that drivers need to place only a modest value on the
time saved by automation for its benefits to exceed direct costs.

systems of gauge- Higgs models and introduce a new observable for the
constraint effective Higgs potential. We use an extension of the so-called
Rattle algorithm to general Hamiltonians for constrained systems, which we
adapt to the 4D Abelian-Higgs model and the 5D SU(2) gauge theory on the torus
and on the orbifold. The derivative of the potential is measured via the
expectation value of the Lagrange multiplier for the constraint condition and
allows a much more precise determination of the effective potential than
conventional histogram methods. With the new method, we can access the
potential over the full domain of the Higgs variable, while the histogram
method is restricted to a short region around the expectation value of the
Higgs field in unconstrained simulations, and the statistical precision does
not deteriorate when the volume is increased. We further verify our results by
comparing to the one-loop Higgs potential of the 4D Abelian-Higgs model in
unitary gauge and find good agreement. To our knowledge, this is the first time
this problem has been addressed for theories with gauge fields. The algorithm
can also be used in four dimensions to study finite temperature and density
transitions via effective Polyakov loop actions.

  Mixed Spectra","24 pages, 3 figures, 4 Tables - Working paper",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, various models have been developed, including the fractional
Brownian motion (fBm), to analyse the stochastic properties of geodetic time
series, together with the extraction of geophysical signals. The noise spectrum
of these time series is generally modeled as a mixed spectrum, with a sum of
white and coloured noise. Here, we are interested in modelling the residual
time series, after deterministically subtracting geophysical signals from the
observations. This residual time series is then assumed to be a sum of three
random variables (r.v.), with the last r.v. belonging to the family of Levy
processes. This stochastic term models the remaining residual signals and other
correlated processes. Via simulations and real time series, we identify three
classes of Levy processes: Gaussian, fractional and stable. In the first case,
residuals are predominantly constituted of short-memory processes. Fractional
Levy process can be an alternative model to the fBm in the presence of
long-term correlations and self-similarity property. Stable process is
characterized by a large variance, which can be satisfied in the case of
heavy-tailed distributions. The application to geodetic time series imply
potential anxiety in the functional model selection where missing geophysical
information can generate such residual time series.

electron correlation in a balanced way, and therefore, can yield accurate and
predictive results even when single-reference methods or multiconfigurational
self-consistent field (MCSCF) theory fails. One of their most prominent
applications in quantum chemistry is the exploration of potential energy
surfaces (PES). This includes the optimization of molecular geometries, such as
equilibrium geometries and conical intersections, and on-the-fly photodynamics
simulations; both depend heavily on the ability of the method to properly
explore the PES. Since such applications require the nuclear gradients and
derivative couplings, the availability of analytical nuclear gradients greatly
improves the utility of quantum chemical methods. This review focuses on the
developments and advances made in the past two decades. To motivate the
readers, we first summarize the notable applications of multireference electron
correlation methods to mainstream chemistry, including geometry optimizations
and on-the-fly dynamics. Subsequently, we review the analytical nuclear
gradient and derivative coupling theories for these methods, and the software
infrastructure that allows one to make use of these quantities in applications.
The future prospects are discussed at the end of this review.
