of two neutron stars allow us to test the nature of matter at supranuclear
densities. Since the Equation of State governing the interior of neutron stars
is only loosely constrained, there is even the possibility that strange quark
matter exists inside the core of neutron stars. We investigate how strange
quark matter cores affect the binary neutron star coalescence by performing
numerical relativity simulations. Interestingly, the strong phase transition
can cause a reduction of the convergence order of the numerical schemes to
first order if the numerical resolution is not high enough. Therefore, an
additional challenge is added in producing high-quality gravitational wave
templates for Equation of States with a strong phase transition. Focusing on
one particular configuration of an equal mass configuration consistent with
GW170817, we compute and discuss the associated gravitational wave signal and
some of the electromagnetic counterparts connected to the merger of the two
stars. We find that existing waveform approximants employed for the analysis of
GW170817 allow describing this kind of systems within the numerical
uncertainties, which, however, are several times larger than for pure hadronic
Equation of States, which means that even higher resolutions have been employed
for an accurate gravitational wave model comparison. We also show that for the
chosen Equation of State, quasi-universal relations describing the
gravitational wave emission after the moment of merger seem to hold and that
the electromagnetic signatures connected to our chosen setup would not be
bright enough to explain the kilonova associated to GW170817.

of Polyakov loops, which is amenable to series expansion methods. We analyse
the effective theory in the cold and dense regime for a general number of
colours, $N_c$. In particular, we investigate the transition from a hadron gas
to baryon condensation. For any finite lattice spacing, we find the transition
to become stronger, i.e. ultimately first-order, as $N_c$ is made large.
Moreover, in the baryon condensed regime, we find the pressure to scale as
$p\sim N_c$ through three orders in the hopping expansion. Such a phase differs
from a hadron gas with $p\sim N_c^0$, or a quark gluon plasma, $p\sim N_c^2$,
and was termed quarkyonic in the literature, since it shows both baryon-like
and quark-like aspects. A lattice filling with baryon number shows a rapid and
smooth transition from condensing baryons to a crystal of saturated quark
matter, due to the Pauli principle, and is consistent with this picture. For
continuum physics, the continuum limit needs to be taken before the large $N_c$
limit, which is not yet possible in practice. However, in the controlled range
of lattice spacings and $N_c$-values, our results are stable when the limits
are approached in this order. We discuss possible implications for physical
QCD.

posts and online interactions. This paper examines various online features of

online signals that can reveal the users' stance. Experimentation is applied on
tweets dataset from the SemEval stance detection task, which covers five
topics. Results show that stance of a user can be detected with multiple
signals of user's online activity, including their posts on the topic, the
network they interact with or follow, the websites they visit, and the content

features are comparable with the state-of-the-art reported model that used
textual content only. In addition, combining network and content features leads
to the highest reported performance to date on the SemEval dataset with

signs, according to their bosonic or fermionic nature. For K3 theories, this
invariant is the source of the Mathieu Moonshine phenomenon. There, the net

an equal number of bosonic and fermionic BPS states present in non-generic

Nevertheless, the space H-roof of all BPS states that are generic to such
orbifold theories provides a convenient framework to construct a particular
generic space of states of K3 theories. We find a natural action of the group
SU(2) on a subspace of H-roof which is compatible with the cancellations of

that this action channels those cancellations. As a by-product, we find a new

since clumpy galaxies at high z should create classical bulges in all galaxies.
This issue is solved in modified gravity models. Bars and spirals in a galaxy
disk, produce gravity torques that drive the gas to the center and fuel central
star formation and nuclear activity.
  At 0.1-1kpc scale, observations of gravity torques show that only about one
third of Seyfert galaxies experience molecular inflow and central fueling,
while in most cases the gas is stalled in resonant rings. At 10-20pc scale,
some galaxies have clearly revealed
  AGN fueling due to nuclear trailing spirals, influenced by the black hole
potential.
  Thanks to ALMA, and angular resolution of up to 80mas it is possible to reach

interpolates the celebrated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model and the $\beta$-model that
assigns one different parameter to each node. By a novel reparameterization of
the $\beta$-model to distinguish global and local parameters, our S$\beta$M can
drastically reduce the dimensionality of the $\beta$-model by requiring some of
the local parameters to be zero. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the
maximum likelihood estimator of the S$\beta$M when the support of the parameter
vector is known. When the support is unknown, we formulate a penalized
likelihood approach with the $\ell_0$-penalty. Remarkably, we show via a
monotonicity lemma that the seemingly combinatorial computational problem due
to the $\ell_0$-penalty can be overcome by assigning nonzero parameters to
those nodes with the largest degrees. We further show that a $\beta$-min
condition guarantees our method to identify the true model and provide excess
risk bounds for the estimated parameters. The estimation procedure enjoys good
finite sample properties as shown by simulation studies. The usefulness of the
S$\beta$M is further illustrated via the analysis of a microfinance take-up

It consists of a central tracker with a surrounding time-of-flight (TOF)
system. The tracker is a one cubic meter volume containing 10 cm-diameter
lithium-drifted silicon (Si(Li)) detectors. The TOF is a plastic scintillator
system that will both trigger the Si(Li) tracker and enable better

antinuclei will form an excited exotic atom. This will then de-excite via
characteristic X-ray transitions before producing a pion/proton star when the
antiparticle annihilates with the nucleus. This unique event topology will give
GAPS the nearly background-free detection capability required for a rare-event

(PMTs) used in the SII camera. The high voltage supply was designed to be
electrically isolated from all other electronics (except for the PMT) to reduce
noise pickup. The HV supply operates on a Li-Ion battery, and the high voltage
level is remotely programmed using a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal that
is generated by an Arduino Yun microcontroller and distributed through a fiber
optic cable. The electrical isolation of the fiber optic control system
suppresses the pickup of radio frequency interference through ground loops. A
separate fiber optic transceiver pair is used for the on-off control of the
high voltage power supply. Tests were performed that show the high voltage
level is reproducible to within one volt for a given duty cycle of the PWM
signal. Furthermore, the high voltage output level was shown to be stable with
respect to variations in the input battery voltage used to power the high
voltage supply. The high voltage system is currently being used in regular SII
observations at VERITAS. This poster will describe the detailed design and
performance of the system.

therapy for cancer patients. However, these algorithms are faced with the
tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. The fast algorithms are generally
less accurate, while the accurate dose engines are often time consuming. In
this work, we try to resolve this dilemma by exploring deep learning (DL) for
dose calculation. Methods: We developed a new radiotherapy dose calculation
engine based on a modified Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net (HD U-net)
model and tested its feasibility with prostate intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) cases. Mapping from an IMRT fluence map domain to a 3D dose
domain requires a deep neural network of complicated architecture and a huge
training dataset. To solve this problem, we first project the fluence maps to
the dose domain using a modified ray-tracing algorithm, and then we use the HD
U-net to map the ray-tracing dose distribution into an accurate dose
distribution calculated using a collapsed cone convolution/superposition (CS)
algorithm. Results: It takes about one second to compute a 3D dose distribution
for a typical 7-field prostate IMRT plan, which can be further reduced to
achieve real-time dose calculation by optimizing the network. For all eight
testing patients, evaluation with Gamma Index and various clinical goals for
IMRT optimization shows that the DL dose distributions are clinically identical
to the CS dose distributions. Conclusions: We have shown the feasibility of
using DL for calculating radiotherapy dose distribution with high accuracy and
efficiency.

However, the impacts of storage vary based on the owner and market conditions.
We examine the policy implications of investments in utility-scale battery
storage via a bi-level optimization model. The lower level depicts power system
operations, modeled as either perfect competition or Cournot oligopoly to allow
for the assessment of producer market power. The upper-level investor is either
a welfare-maximizer or a profit-maximizing standalone merchant to reflect
either welfare enhancement or arbitrage, respectively. We implement a realistic
case study for Western Europe based on all possible size-location storage
investment combinations. We find that market competition affects investment
sizes, locations, and their profitability more than the investor's objectives.
A welfare-maximizer under perfect competition invests the most in storage
capacity. Consumers typically gain most from storage investments in all cases,
exceeding the gains for the investors. Specifically, our results show that
storage investments may either not occur or be located differently than at
social optimum, if market power is exerted. Thus, policy makers need to
anticipate producer market power when setting regulation.

contemporary Physics' state spaces. We now widen this approach by mild
recategorization to one based on Nambu's generalization of Lie's Mathematics,
as follows. i) In this approach, the Lie derivative still suffices to encode
Relationalism. ii) Closure is now assessed using the Nambu bracket - with $n$
slots rather than 2, so the first nontrivially Lie case has 3 slots - and a
`Nambu Algorithm' analogue of the Dirac and Lie Algorithms. This produces a
class of Nambu algebraic structures of generators or of first-class
constraints. iii) Nambu observables are defined by Nambu brackets
zero-commutation with generators or with first-class constraints; we use the
Nambu analogue of the Jacobi identity to simplify this discussion relative to a
previous treatment. These Nambu brackets relations can moreover be recast as
explicit PDEs to be solved using the Flow Method. Nambu observables themselves
form Nambu algebras. Lattices of Nambu constraint or generator algebraic
substructures furthermore induce dual lattices of Nambu observables
subalgebras. iv) Deformation of Nambu algebraic structures encountering
Rigidity gives a means of Constructing more structure from less. v)
Reallocation of Intermediary-Object Invariance gives the general Nambu
algebraic structure's analogue of posing Refoliation Invariance for GR. We also
draw some motivation from M-Theory's use of Nambu Mathematics along the lines
of Bagger, Lambert and Gustavsson, finding some qualitative distinctions

defense strategies are based on wavelet domain denoising of the input examples
by investigating each wavelet sub-band and removing the sub-bands that are most
affected by the adversary. The first proposed defense strategy reconstructs
multiple denoised versions of the input example through manipulating the mid-
and high-frequency components of the wavelet domain representation of the input
example and makes a decision upon the classification result of the majority of
the denoised examples. The second and third proposed defense strategies aim to
denoise each wavelet domain sub-band and determine the sub-bands that are most
likely affected by the adversary using the reconstruction error computed for
each sub-band. We test the performance of the proposed defense strategies
against several attack scenarios and compare the results with five state of the

applications by letting the programmer designate certain code blocks as atomic.
Programmers using a TM often would like to access the same data both inside and
outside transactions, and would prefer their programs to have a strongly atomic
semantics, which allows transactions to be viewed as executing atomically with
respect to non-transactional accesses. Since guaranteeing such semantics for
arbitrary programs is prohibitively expensive, researchers have suggested
guaranteeing it only for certain data-race free (DRF) programs, particularly
those that follow the privatization idiom: from some point on, threads agree
that a given object can be accessed non-transactionally.
  In this paper we show that a variant of Transactional DRF (TDRF) by
Dalessandro et al. is appropriate for a class of privatization-safe TMs, which
allow using privatization idioms. We prove that, if such a TM satisfies a
condition we call privatization-safe opacity and a program using the TM is TDRF
under strongly atomic semantics, then the program indeed has such semantics. We
also present a method for proving privatization-safe opacity that reduces
proving this generalization to proving the usual opacity, and apply the method
to a TM based on two-phase locking and a privatization-safe version of TL2.
Finally, we establish the inherent cost of privatization-safety: we prove that
a TM cannot be progressive and have invisible reads if it guarantees strongly
atomic semantics for TDRF programs.

There has been a noticeable misconception of the similarity between the stance

To analyze the relation between stance and sentiment, we construct a new

meta-learner is generally more resistant to noise, for example seeing a smaller
reduction in performance in Noisy and Sampling environments and performs better
on average by a `gain' metric than its closest comparable competitor L-BFGS-B.
These results are an important indication that meta-learning and associated

pumping of electronic spin currents in the absence of any bias voltage. Prior
to the instant of annihilation, their power spectrum is ultrabroadband, so they
can be converted into rapidly changing in time charge currents, via the inverse
spin Hall effect, as a source of THz radiation of bandwidth $\simeq 27$ THz
where the lowest frequency is controlled by the applied magnetic field. The
spin pumping stems from time-dependent fields introduced into the quantum
Hamiltonian of electrons by the classical dynamics of localized magnetic
moments (LMMs) comprising the domains. The pumped currents carry spin-polarized
electrons which, in turn, exert backaction on LMMs in the form of nonlocal
damping which is more than twice as large as conventional local Gilbert
damping. The nonlocal damping can substantially modify the spectrum of emitted
SWs when compared to widely-used micromagnetic simulations where conduction
electrons are completely absent. Since we use fully microscopic (i.e.,
Hamiltonian-based) framework, self-consistently combining time-dependent

finite frequency box for matrix inversions is typically used, which often
requires some treatment of asymptotic behaviour of vertices. Recently [Phys.
Rev. B 83, 085102 (2011); 97, 235140 (2018)] it was proposed to split the
considered frequency box into smaller and larger one; in the smaller frequency
box the numerically exact vertices are used, while beyond this box asymptotics
of vertices are applied. Yet, this method requires numerical treatment of
vertex asymptotics (including corresponding matrix manipulations) in the larger
frequency box and/or knowing fermion-boson vertices, which may be not
convenient for numerical calculations. In the present paper we derive the
formulae which treat analytically contribution of vertices beyond chosen
frequency box, such that only numerical operations with vertices in the chosen
small frequency box are required. The method is tested on the Hubbard model and
can be used in a broad range of applications of non-local extensions of
dynamical mean-field theory.

development. Problems such as modularity, centrality, alignment, and clustering
have been formalized and solved in various application contexts. In this paper,
we focus on databases for applications in which graphs have a spatial basis,
which we refer to as rigid graphs. Nodes in such graphs have preferred
positions relative to their graph neighbors. Examples of such graphs include
abstractions of large biomolecules, functional connectomes of the human brain,
and mobile device/ sensor communication logs. When analyzing such networks it
is important to consider edge lengths; e.g., when identifying conserved
patterns through graph alignment, it is important for conserved edges to have
correlated lengths, in addition to topological similarity. In contrast to a
large body of work on topological graph alignment, rigid graph alignment
simultaneously aligns the network, as well as the underlying structure as
characterized by edge lengths. We formulate the problem and present a
meta-algorithm based on expectation-maximization that alternately aligns the
network and the structure. We demonstrate that our meta-algorithm significantly
improves the quality of alignments in target applications, compared to
topological or structural aligners alone. We apply rigid graph alignment to
functional brain networks derived from 20 subjects drawn from the Human
Connectome Project (HCP) database, and show over a two-fold increase in quality
of alignment over state of the art topological aligners. We evaluate the impact
of various parameters associated with input datasets through a study on
synthetic graphs, where we fully characterize the performance of our method.
Our results are broadly applicable to other applications and abstracted

the presence of three types of commonly found instabilities, namely ghost (when

tachyon (negative mass squared). In particular, we study the linear scalar
perturbations of theories with two interacting scalar fields as a proxy for a
dark energy and matter fields, and explicitly show how canonical
transformations relate these three types of instabilities with each other. We
generically show that low-energy ghosts are equivalent to tachyonic
instabilities, and that high-energy ghosts are equivalent to gradient
instabilities. Via examples we make evident the fact that whenever one of these
fields exhibits an instability then the entire physical system becomes
unstable, with an unbounded Hamiltonian. Finally, we discuss the role of
interactions between the two fields, and show that whereas most of the time
interactions will not determine whether an instability is present or not, they
may affect the timescale of the instability. We also find exceptional cases in
which the two fields are ghosts and hence the physical system is seemingly

typically described as projections of higher-dimensional periodic lattices onto
the physical dimension. The concept of a reference higher-dimensional space,
called a superspace, has proved useful in relation to quasiperiodic systems.
Although some quantum-mechanical systems in quasiperiodic media have been shown
to admit quasiperiodic states, any sort of general Hamiltonian formalism in
superspace is lacking to this date. Here, we show how to extend generic
quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians to higher dimensions in such a way that
eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian are obtained as projections of the
Hamiltonian in superspace, which we call the super Hamiltonian. We apply the
super Hamiltonian formalism to a simple, yet realistic one-dimensional quantum
particle in a quasiperiodic potential without the tight-binding approximation,
and obtain continuously labelled eigenstates of the system corresponding to a
continuous spectrum. All states corresponding to the continuum are
quasiperiodic. We also obtain the Green's functions for continuum states in
closed form and, from them, the density of states and local density of states,
and scattering states off defects and impurities. The closed form of this
one-dimensional Green's function is equally valid for any continuum state in
any one-dimensional single-particle quantum system admitting continuous
spectrum. With the basis set we use, which is periodic in superspace, and
therefore quasiperiodic in physical space, we find that Anderson-localised
states are also quasiperiodic if distributional solutions are admitted, but
circumvent this difficulty by generalising the superspace method to open
boundary conditions (cont'd).

astrometric observations. This is enabled by the accurate proper motion
measurements from the Hipparcos and Gaia missions, which constrain the orbital

In particular we show that $\gamma$-ray experiments with a peak of sensitivity

study of the sensitivity of HAWC, HESS and the future CTA experiment finding
that, with efficiencies of the order of a few %, the first two experiments
should have already detected a few tens of ICS halos while the latter will
increase the number of detections by a factor of 4. We then consider a sample
of sources associated to PWNe and detected in the HESS Galactic plane survey
and in the second HAWC catalog. We use the information available in these
catalogs for the $\gamma$-ray spatial morphology and flux of these sources to
inspect the value of $D_0$ around them and the $e^{\pm}$ injection spectrum.
All sources are detected as extended with a $\gamma$-ray emission extended
about $15-80$ pc. Assuming that most of the $e^{\pm}$ accelerated by these

coefficient is $2-30 \cdot 10^{26}$ cm$^2$/s at 1 TeV, i.e. two orders of

School 2017. The main goal is to explain the connection between the ODE/IM
correspondence and the classical integrability of strings in AdS. As a warm up,
we first discuss the classical three-point function of the Liouville theory.
The starting point is the well-known fact that the classical solutions to the
Liouville equation can be constructed by solving a Schrodinger-like
differential equation. We then convert it into a set of functional equations
using a method similar to the ODE/IM correspondence. The classical three-point
functions can be computed directly from these functional equations, and the
result matches with the classical limit of the celebrated DOZZ formula. We then
discuss the semi-classical three-point function of strings in AdS2 and show
that one can apply a similar idea by making use of the classical integrability
of the string sigma model on AdS2. The result is given in terms of the
""massive"" generalization of Gamma functions, which show up also in string
theory on pp-wave backgrounds and the twistorial generalization of topological
string.

the reversible release of electrical energy stored as a difference of potential
across the cell membrane appears as a simple yet consistent explanation for the
heat production, as proposed in the ""Condenser Theory."" However, the Condenser
Theory has not been analyzed beyond the analogy between the cell membrane and a
parallel-plate capacitor, i.e. a condenser, which cannot account for the
magnitude of the heat signature. In this work, we use a detailed electrostatic
model of the cell membrane to revisit the Condenser Theory. We derive
expressions for free energy and entropy changes associated with the
depolarization of the membrane by the action potential, which give a direct
measure of the heat produced and absorbed by neurons. We show how the density
of surface charges on both sides of the membrane impacts the energy changes.
Finally, considering a typical action potential, we show that if the membrane
holds a bias of surface charges, such that the internal side of the membrane is
0.05 C m$^{-2}$ more negative than the external side, the size of the heat
predicted by the model reaches the range of experimental values. Based on our

is particularly necessary since Nagaoka ferromagnetism is fragile and arises
only under rather special conditions. We test the robustness of ground state
ferromagnetism in the presence of a long-range Coulomb interaction and
long-range as well as short-range interdot hopping by modeling a wide range of
different plaquette geometries accessible by arranging a few (~4) quantum dots
in a controlled manner. We find that ferromagnetism is robust to the presence

Achieving neutrino masses consistent with atmospheric and solar neutrino data,

symmetry protecting the right handed neutrinos from getting a mass. Thermal
leptogenesis would then require that such a symmetry be broken below the
reheating temperature. We enumerate all such possible symmetries consistent
with these minimal assumptions and their corresponding defects, finding that in
many cases, gravitational waves from the network of cosmic strings should be

to be better crystalline to enhance the charge mobility, hence the improvement
of the OPVC performance. The influences on the nano-morphology of the electron
donor and accepter domains are not well understood. Here, using the
cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (XSTM/S), the
electric-field-assisted annealing treatment is found to influence the molecular
domains to be elongated with the orientation near the direction of the external
electric field. The elongation of the molecular domains is believed to
facilitate the domain percolation, which causes higher charge mobility, hence
the higher short-circuit current density (Jsc). On the other hand, it was also
observed that the electronic properties of the P3HT-rich and PCBM-rich domains
in the electric-field-assisted annealed samples showed smaller energy band gaps
and smaller molecular orbital offset between the two domains, which is argued
to decrease the open circuit voltage (Voc) and negatively impact the OPVC
performance. Based on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small angle X-ray

due to the molecular intermixing induced doping effects. These results point

influence of supermassive black holes are limited by the current large
uncertainties in the determination of black hole masses. One dominant
limitation is the unknown geometry, dynamics and line-of-sight inclination of
the broad line region, used to probe the central black hole mass. Recent
progress has been made to constrain the spatial and kinematic structure of the
broad line region using dynamical modelling of AGN monitoring data and an
underlying physical model for the broad line region. In this work we test the
ability of a modified version of this dynamical modelling code to constrain the
broad line region structure using single-epoch spectra. We test our modelling
code on single-epoch spectra of nearby Arp 151 by comparing our results with
those obtained with monitoring data of this same object. We find that a
significant fraction of the broad line region parameters can indeed be
adequately constrained, with uncertainties that are comparable to, or at most a
factor of ~ a few higher than those obtained from modelling of monitoring data.
Considering the wealth of available single-epoch spectroscopic observations,
this method is promising for establishing the overall AGN population trends in
the geometry and dynamics of the broad line region. This method can be applied
to spectra of AGN at low and high redshift making it valuable for studies of
cosmological black hole and AGN evolution.

quality of the collected images. A passive approach to improve image quality is
one that lags behind improvements in imaging hardware, awaiting better sensor
technology of acquisition devices. An alternative, active strategy is to
utilize prior knowledge of the imaging system to directly post-process and
improve the acquired images. Traditionally, priors about the image properties
are taken into account to restrict the solution space. However, few techniques
exploit the prior about the noise properties. In this paper, we propose a
neural network-based model for disentangling the signal and noise components of
an input noisy image, without the need for any ground truth training data. We
design a unified loss function that encodes priors about signal as well as
noise estimate in the form of regularization terms. Specifically, by using
total variation and piecewise constancy priors along with noise whiteness
priors such as auto-correlation and stationary losses, our network learns to
decouple an input noisy image into the underlying signal and noise components.
We compare our proposed method to Noise2Noise and Noise2Self, as well as
non-local mean and BM3D, on three public confocal laser endomicroscopy
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our network
compared to state-of-the-art in terms of PSNR and SSIM.

isometry classes of sum-rank Hamming codes are in bijective correspondence with
maximal-size partial spreads. In that case, it is also shown that sum-rank
Hamming codes are perfect codes for the sum-rank metric. Also in that case,

of sum-rank Hamming codes, called sum-rank simplex codes, are then introduced.
Bounds on the minimum sum-rank distance of sum-rank simplex codes are given

Hamming codes are proposed for error correction in multishot

condensed matter, high energy physics, cosmology, to biological systems, and
consist of slow and long-distance fluctuations near a phase transition or
critical point. Usually, these phenomena are associated with the softening of a
massive mode. Here we show that a novel, non-Hermitian-induced mechanism of
critical phenomena that do not fall into this class can arise in the steady
state of generic driven-dissipative many-body systems with coupled binary order
parameters such as exciton-polariton condensates and driven-dissipative
Bose-Einstein condensates in a double-well potential. The criticality of this
``critical exceptional point'' is attributed to the coalescence of the
collective eigenmodes that convert all the thermal-and-dissipative-noise
activated fluctuations to the Goldstone mode, leading to anomalously giant
phase fluctuations that diverge at spatial dimensions $d\le 4$. Our dynamic
renormalization group analysis shows that this gives rise to a strong-coupling
fixed point at dimensions as high as $d<8$ associated with a new universality
class beyond the classification by Hohenberg and Halperin, indicating how
anomalously strong the many-body corrections are at this point. We find that
this anomalous enhancement of many-body correlation is due to the appearance of

families created by these impacts with families corresponding to non-rotating
targets. The rotation affects mostly cratering events at oblique impact angles.
The total mass ejected by these collision can be up to five times larger for
rotating targets. We further compute the transfer of the angular momentum and
determine conditions under which impacts accelerate or decelerate the target.
While individual cratering collisions can cause both acceleration and
deceleration, the deceleration prevails on average, collisions thus cause a

computing the permanent of 0-1 matrices, is an important combinatorial problem
that has been extensively studied by theoreticians and practitioners alike. The
permanent is #P-Complete; hence it is unlikely that a polynomial-time algorithm
exists for the problem. Researchers have therefore focused on finding tractable
subclasses of matrices for permanent computation. One such subclass that has
received much attention is that of sparse matrices i.e. matrices with few
entries set to 1, the rest being 0. For this subclass, improved theoretical
upper bounds and practically efficient algorithms have been developed. In this
paper, we ask whether it is possible to go beyond sparse matrices in our quest
for developing scalable techniques for the permanent, and answer this question
affirmatively. Our key insight is to represent permanent computation
symbolically using Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs). ADD-based techniques
naturally use dynamic programming, and hence avoid redundant computation
through memoization. This permits exploiting the hidden structure in a large
class of matrices that have so far remained beyond the reach of permanent
computation techniques. The availability of sophisticated libraries
implementing ADDs also makes the task of engineering practical solutions
relatively straightforward. While a complete characterization of matrices
admitting a compact ADD representation remains open, we provide strong
experimental evidence of the effectiveness of our approach for computing the
permanent, not just for sparse matrices, but also for dense matrices and for
matrices with ""similar"" rows.

within the context of a minimum thermal conductivity approximation. By fitting
a modified minimum thermal conductivity model to temperature-dependent

interstitial polymer {\it eliminates} boundary scattering in the disordered
nanoparticle packing, which surprisingly leads to an {\it increase} in the
overall thermal conductivity of the disordered nanoparticle thin-film
composite. This is contrary to our expectations relative to effective medium
theory and our understanding of a minimum thermal conductivity limit. Instead,
we find that a stiff interstitial material improves the transmission of heat
through a nanoparticle boundary, improving the thermal properties of disordered
nanoparticle packing. We expect these results to provide insight into the
tunability of thermal properties in disordered solids that exhibit already low

all valid dimensions $i$ of the subspaces, are found, by combining two groups
of results. The first, published separately, provides finite sets
${\mathcal{F}}$ of subspaces such that reflection symmetry (or rotational
symmetry) with respect to each subspace in ${\mathcal{F}}$ implies full
rotational symmetry. In the second, proved here, a theorem of Klain for Steiner
symmetrization is extended to Schwarz, Minkowski, Minkowski-Blaschke, and fiber
symmetrizations, showing that if a sequence of subspaces is drawn from a finite
set ${\mathcal{F}}$ of subspaces, the successive symmetrals of any compact
convex set converge to a compact convex set that is symmetric with respect to
any subspace in ${\mathcal{F}}$ appearing infinitely often in the sequence. It
is also proved that for Steiner, Schwarz, and Minkowski symmetrizations, a
sequence of $i$-dimensional subspaces is universal for the class of compact
sets if and only if it is universal for the class of compact convex sets, and
Klain's theorem is shown to hold for Schwarz symmetrization of compact sets.

the dynamics of quantum gravity. We present here a geometric classification of
all spherically symmetric spacetimes that could result from singularity

conclusion of our analysis is that the number of independent classes of

handful of qualitatively different possibilities. But our most surprising
result is that this catalogue of possibilities clearly demonstrates that the
degree of internal consistency and the strength of deviations with respect to
general relativity are strongly, and positively, correlated. Hence, either
quantum fluctuations of spacetime come to the rescue and solve these internal
consistency issues, or singularity regularization will percolate to macroscopic

tasks that have high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. However,
policy gradient methods are also notoriously sample inefficient. This can be
attributed, at least in part, to the high variance in estimating the gradient
of the task objective with Monte Carlo methods. Previous research has
endeavored to contend with this problem by studying control variates (CVs) that
can reduce the variance of estimates without introducing bias, including the
early use of baselines, state dependent CVs, and the more recent state-action
dependent CVs. In this work, we analyze the properties and drawbacks of
previous CV techniques and, surprisingly, we find that these works have
overlooked an important fact that Monte Carlo gradient estimates are generated
by trajectories of states and actions. We show that ignoring the correlation
across the trajectories can result in suboptimal variance reduction, and we
propose a simple fix: a class of ""trajectory-wise"" CVs, that can further drive
down the variance. We show that constructing trajectory-wise CVs can be done
recursively and requires only learning state-action value functions like the
previous CVs for policy gradient. We further prove that the proposed
trajectory-wise CVs are optimal for variance reduction under reasonable
assumptions.

protoplanetary disks challenge our understanding of physical and chemical
evolutions in disks. Here we investigate the CO abundance structures in four
well-studied disks and compare their structures with predictions of chemical
processing of CO and transport of CO ice-coated dust grains in disks. We use
spatially resolved CO isotopologue line observations and detailed
thermo-chemical models to derive CO abundance structures. We find that the CO
abundance varies with radius by an order of magnitude in these disks. We show
that although chemical processes can efficiently reduce the total column of CO
gas within 1 Myr under an ISM level of cosmic-ray ionization rate, the
depletion mostly occurs at the deep region of a disk. Without sufficient
vertical mixing, the surface layer is not depleted enough to reproduce weak CO
emissions observed. The radial profiles of CO depletion in three disks are
qualitatively consistent with predictions of pebble formation, settling, and
drifting in disks. But the dust evolution alone cannot fully explain the high
depletion observed in some disks. These results suggest that dust evolution may
play a significant role in transporting volatile materials and a coupled
chemical-dynamical study is necessary to understand what raw materials are

precision for safety, particular for high motion speed. The performance
degradation is caused by the inability of the joint servo controller to address
the uncertain nonlinear dynamics of the robot arm, e.g., due to joint
flexibility. We consider two approaches to improve the trajectory tracking
performance through feedforward compensation. The first approach uses iterative
learning control, with the gradient-based iterative update generated from the
robot forward dynamics model. The second approach uses dynamic inversion to
directly compensate for the robot forward dynamics. If the forward dynamics is
strictly proper or is non-minimum-phase (e.g., due to time delays), its stable
inverse would be non-causal. Both approaches require robot dynamical models.
This paper presents results of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to
approximate these dynamical models-forward dynamics in the first case, inverse
dynamics (possibly non-causal) in the second case. We use the bi-directional
RNN to capture the noncausality. The RNNs are trained based on a collection of
commanded trajectories and the actual robot responses. We use a Baxter robot to
evaluate the two approaches. The Baxter robot exhibits significant joint
flexibility due to the series-elastic joint actuators. Both approaches achieve
sizable improvement over the uncompensated robot motion, for both random joint
trajectories and Cartesian motion. The inverse dynamics method is particularly
attractive as it may be used to more accurately track a user input as in

classical solutions respecting the null energy condition and containing a pair
of oppositely charged black holes connected by a non-traversable wormhole. We
then consider the perturbative back-reaction of bulk quantum fields in
Hartle-Hawking states. Our geometries have zero cosmological constant and are
asymptotically flat except for a cosmic string stretching to infinity that is
used to hold the black holes apart. Another cosmic string wraps the
non-contractible cycle through the wormhole, and its quantum fluctuations
provide the negative energy needed for traversability. Our setting is closely
related to the non-perturbative construction of Maldacena, Milekhin, and Popov
(MMP), but the analysis is complementary. In particular, we consider cases
where back-reaction slows, but fails to halt, the collapse of the wormhole
interior, so that the wormhole is traversable only at sufficiently early times.
For non-extremal backgrounds, we find the integrated null energy along the
horizon of the classical background to be exponentially small, and thus
traversability to be exponentially fragile. Nevertheless, if there are no
larger perturbations, and for appropriately timed signals, a wormhole with
mouths separated by a distance $d$ becomes traversable with a minimum transit
time $t_{\text{min transit}} = d + \text{logs}$. Thus $\frac{t_{\text{min
transit}}}{d}$ is smaller than for the eternally traversable MMP wormholes by
more than a factor of 2, and approaches the value that, at least in higher
dimensions, would be the theoretical minimum. For contrast we also briefly
consider a `cosmological wormhole' solution where the back-reaction has the
opposite sign, so that negative energy from quantum fields makes the wormhole
harder to traverse.

NASA initiated four large strategic mission concept studies (HabEx, LUVOIR,
Lynx, and Origins), which have mature designs, including detailed technology
assessments and development plans. Two of these concepts, HabEx and LUVOIR, are
responsive to the recommendations of the previous DS regarding a UV-capable
mission. Both are more powerful successors to HST, with UV-to-optical
capabilities that range from significant enhancements to orders-of-magnitude
improvement. At the same time, technological and scientific advances over the
past decade only now make it feasible to marry such a mission with one that can
search for life outside the solar system. Acknowledging that the constraints
that the Astro2020 DS must consider may be difficult to anticipate, the HabEx
and LUVOIR studies present eleven different variants, each of which enable
groundbreaking science, including the direct imaging and characterization of
exoplanets. The HabEx and LUVOIR mission studies offer a full suite of options
to the Astro2020 DS, with corresponding flexibility in budgeting and phasing.

fluxes for abelian subgroups of the $E_8$ global symmetry of the $6d$ SCFT. We
argue that the theories corresponding to such tori are built from a simple
model we denote as $E[USp(2Q)]$. This model has a variety of non trivial
properties. In particular the global symmetry is $USp(2Q)\times USp(2Q)\times
U(1)^2$ with one of the two $USp(2Q)$ symmetries emerging in the IR as an
enhancement of an $SU(2)^Q$ symmetry of the UV Lagrangian. The $E[USp(2Q)]$
model after dimensional reduction to $3d$ and a subsequent Coulomb branch flow
is closely related to the familiar $3d$ $T[SU(Q)]$ theory, the model residing
on an S-duality domain wall of $4d$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(Q)$ SYM. Gluing the
$E[USp(2Q)]$ models by gauging the $USp(2Q)$ symmetries with proper admixtures
of chiral superfields gives rise to systematic constructions of many examples
of $4d$ theories with emergent IR symmetries. We support our claims by various
checks involving computations of anomalies and supersymmetric partition
functions. Many of the needed identities satisfied by the supersymmetric
indices follow directly from recent mathematical results obtained by E. Rains.

and more vector fields. We focus on models with the gauge structure of
``diagonal color $SU(n)$'' but unlike previous investigators, we do not assume
that all the gauge boson masses are the same. Unlike the Schwinger model, these
are Banks-Zaks models with conformal sectors that survive at long distances. In
addition to local operators that go to ``unparticle operators'' with non-zero
anomalous dimensions at long distances, they contain local operators like the
$\bar\psi_L\psi_R$ operator in the Schwinger model which go to constants at
long distances. These operators have calculable vacuum expectation values (up
to phases). Cluster decomposition applied to correlation functions involving
these operators yields nontrivial and calculable non-perturbative constraints
on correlation functions. One consequence is ``conformal coalescence'' in which
linear combinations of short distance operators disappear from the
long-distance theory, leaving only one kind of unparticle stuff in the
low-energy theory. We believe that our detailed analysis of diagonal color
$SU(n)$ paints an appealing picture of unparticle operators as the result of an
incomplete binding of the massless fermions. We complete the picture (and the
binding) by analyzing the diagonal color $U(n)$ model with a very small $U(1)$
coupling and thus a gauge boson with a dynamical mass much smaller than the
other masses in the model. This model has a mass gap and we can see explicitly
the transition from free-fermion behavior at short distances to unparticle
physics at intermediate distances to the physics of massive particles at long
distances.

discover image locations that are most relevant for answering a specific
question. For this purpose, several multimodal fusion strategies have been
proposed, ranging from relatively simple operations (e.g., linear sum) to more
complex ones (e.g., Block). The resulting multimodal representations define an
intermediate feature space for capturing the interplay between visual and
semantic features, that is helpful in selectively focusing on image content. In
this paper, we propose a question-agnostic attention mechanism that is
complementary to the existing question-dependent attention mechanisms. Our
proposed model parses object instances to obtain an `object map' and applies
this map on the visual features to generate Question-Agnostic Attention (QAA)
features. In contrast to question-dependent attention approaches that are
learned end-to-end, the proposed QAA does not involve question-specific
training, and can be easily included in almost any existing VQA model as a
generic light-weight pre-processing step, thereby adding minimal computation
overhead for training. Further, when used in complement with the
question-dependent attention, the QAA allows the model to focus on the regions
containing objects that might have been overlooked by the learned attention
representation. Through extensive evaluation on VQAv1, VQAv2 and TDIUC
datasets, we show that incorporating complementary QAA allows state-of-the-art
VQA models to perform better, and provides significant boost to simplistic VQA

massive machine type communications. In this paradigm, the number of users may
be comparable or even larger than the coding blocklength $n$. In contrast,
classical MAC often assumes fixed and small number of the users. In this paper,
we consider the massive access channel with multiple antennas system, where the
base station (BS) with multiple receiving antennas serves the users in a single
cell. The magnitude of users is assumed to grow unbounded with $n$. We
investigate the achievable region of MIMO massive access channel, where among
the total users, an unknown subset referred to active users may transmit data
periodically. The asymptotic active user identification cost is also
quantified. With the theoretical analysis, it was shown that given finite
number of the receiving antennas, the individual rate for each user can be
formulated as the sum rate multiplied by some specific factors, which
correspond to the allocation of sum capacity. The successive decoding does not
apply due to the interferences from growing unbounded users. Theoretical
analysis shows that successive decoding works only when the number of receiving
antennas goes to infinity with the increasing codelength.

standard models of studying scalar and vector transport processes in
heterogeneous materials and media, such as fluid flow in porous media, and
conduction, deformations, and electric and dielectric breakdown in
heterogeneous solids. The computation time and required memory are two limiting
factors that hinder the scalability of the computations to very large sizes. We
present a dual approach, based on the use of a combination of the central
processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), to simulation of
flow, transport, and similar problems using the network models. A
mixed-precision algorithm, together with the conjugate-gradient method is
implemented on a single GPU solver. The efficiency of the method is tested with
a variety of cases, including pore- and random-resistor network models in which
the conductances are long-range correlated, and also contain percolation
disorder. Both isotropic and anisotropic networks are considered. To put the
method to a stringent test, the long-range correlations are generated by a
fractional Brownian motion (FBM), which we generate by a message-passing
interface method. For all the cases studied an overall speed-up factor of about
one order of magnitude or better is obtained, which increases with the size of
the network. Even the critical slow-down in networks near the percolation
threshold does not decrease the speed-up significantly. We also obtain
approximate but accurate bounds for the permeability anisotropy $K_x/K_y$ for
stratified porous media.

high-frequency transducers, which makes tomography techniques based on
numerical wave propagation simulations computationally challenging, especially
in 3D. Therefore, despite the finite-frequency nature of ultrasonic waves,
ray-theoretical approaches to transmission tomography are still widely used.
  This work introduces finite-frequency traveltime tomography to medical
ultrasound. In addition to being computationally tractable for 3D imaging at
high frequencies, the method has two main advantages: (1) It correctly accounts
for the frequency dependence and volumetric sensitivity of traveltime
measurements, which are related to off-ray-path scattering and diffraction. (2)
It naturally enables out-of-plane imaging and the construction of 3D images
from 2D slice-by-slice acquisition systems.
  Our method rests on the availability of calibration data in water, used to
linearize the forward problem and to provide analytical expressions of
cross-correlation traveltime sensitivity. As a consequence of the finite
frequency content, sensitivity is distributed in multiple Fresnel volumes,
thereby providing out-of-plane sensitivity. To improve computational
efficiency, we develop a memory-efficient implementation by encoding the
Jacobian operator with a 1D parameterization, which allows us to extend the
method to large-scale domains. We validate our tomographic approach using lab
measurements collected with a 2D setup of transducers and using a cylindrically
symmetric phantom. We then demonstrate its applicability for 3D reconstructions
by simulating a slice-by-slice acquisition systems using the same dataset.

an artifact of the mechanics of interaction of biomolecular complexes and the

which is addressed here by supplementing EM data with Small-Angle X-Ray

the accumulation of data grows, the importance of the quantitative validation
has been highlighted in the recent studies, i.e. digital twin. The key
component of quantitative validation is finding a calibrated set of parameters
to regenerate the real-world observations with simulation models. While this
parameter calibration has been fixed throughout a simulation execution, this
paper expands the static parameter calibration in two dimensions: dynamic
calibration and heterogeneous calibration. First, dynamic calibration changes
the parameter values over the simulation period by reflecting the simulation
output trend. Second, heterogeneous calibration changes the parameter values
per simulated entity clusters by considering the similarities of entity states.
We experimented the suggested calibrations on one hypothetical case and another
real-world case. As a hypothetical scenario, we use the Wealth Distribution

selected Real Estate Market Model because of three reasons. First, the models
have heterogeneous entities as being agent-based models; second, they are
economic models with real-world trends over time; and third, they are
applicable to the real-world scenarios where we can gather validation data.

the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) QCD approach, the conventional DY TSAs
are interpreted as convolutions of the beam pion and of the transversely

$q_T$-weighted TSAs can be interpreted as simple products of transverse moments

without electron correlations. However, the electronic structure in the middle
phase between the HT and LT phases has not been clarified. The polarized

temperature, but that along the $b$ axis opens below the lower transition
temperature. The finding suggests that the two-step MIT originates from the

natural language alone is often highly ambiguous, whereas examples in isolation
are often not sufficient for conveying user intent. Our proposed technique
first parses the English description into a so-called hierarchical sketch that
guides our programming-by-example (PBE) engine. Since the hierarchical sketch
captures crucial hints, the PBE engine can leverage this information to both
prioritize the search as well as make useful deductions for pruning the search
space. We have implemented the proposed technique in a tool called Regel and
evaluate it on over three hundred regexes. Our evaluation shows that Regel
achieves 80% accuracy whereas the NLP-only and PBE-only baselines achieve 43%

adaptation of AlphaRegex, a state-of-the-art regex synthesis tool, and show
that our proposed PBE engine is an order of magnitude faster, even if we adapt

they propagate, and learning these structures is essential for understanding
and intervention on complex network processes such as epidemics and
(mis)information propagation. However, using contagion data to infer network
structure is a challenging inverse problem. In particular, it is imperative to
have appropriate measures of uncertainty in network structure estimates,
however these are largely ignored in most machine-learning approaches. We
present a probabilistic framework that uses samples from the distribution of
networks that are compatible with the dynamics observed to produce network and
uncertainty estimates. We demonstrate the method using the well known
independent cascade model to sample from the distribution of networks P(G)
conditioned on the observation of a set of infections C. We evaluate the
accuracy of the method by using the marginal probabilities of each edge in the
distribution, and show the bene ts of quantifying uncertainty to improve
estimates and understanding, particularly with small amounts of data.

observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation~(CMB) and the

Hubble tension without changing the Planck's constraint on the matter and dark
energy densities. For the extra negative density to be sufficiently small, its
equation-of-state parameter must satisfy $1/3\leq w_{X}\leq1$. We propose a
quintom model of two scalar fields that realizes this condition and potentially
alleviate the Hubble tension. One scalar field acts as a quintessence while
another ""phantom"" scalar conformally couples to matter in such a way that
viable cosmological scenario can be achieved. The model depends only on two
parameters, $\lambda_{\phi}$ and $\delta$ which represent rolling tendency of
the self-interacting potential of the quintessence and the strength of
conformal phantom-matter coupling respectively. The toy quintom model with

failure. Major systemic-and procedural-based issues have subsequently been
identified in both clinical trials and preclinical animal model
experimentation. As well, issues related to the neuroprotective moiety itself
have contributed to clinical trial failures, including late delivery,
mono-targeting, low potency and poor tolerability. Conditioning (pre-or post-)
strategies can potentially address these issues and are therefore gaining
increasing attention as approaches to protect the brain from cerebral ischemia.
In principle, conditioning can address concerns of timing (preconditioning
could be pre-emptively applied in high-risk patients, and post-conditioning
after patients experience an unannounced brain infarction) and signaling
(multi-modal). However, acute neuroprotection and conditioning strategies face
a common translational issue: a myriad of possibilities exist, but with no
strategy to select optimal candidates. In this review, we argue that what is
required is a neuroprotective framework to identify the ""best"" agent(s), at the
earliest investigational stage possible. This may require switching mindsets
from identifying how neuroprotection can be achieved to determining how
neuroprotection can fail, for the vast majority of candidates. Understanding
the basis for failure can in turn guide supplementary treatment, thereby
forming an evidence-based rationale for selecting combinations of therapies. An
appropriately designed in vitro (neuron culture, brain slices) approach, based
on increasing the harshness of the ischemic-like insult, can be useful in
identifying the ""best"" conditioner or acute neuroprotective therapy, as well as
how the two modalities can be combined to overcome individual limitations. This
would serve as a base from which to launch further investigation into therapies
required to protect the neurovascular unit in in vivo animal models of cerebral
ischemia. Based on these respective approaches, our laboratories suggest that
there is merit in examining synaptic activity-and nutraceutical-based
preconditioning / acute neuroprotection.

object-level recognition, recognizing the attributes of parts remains less

part attribute recognition methods rely on the part annotation which is more
expensive to obtain. To solve the data insufficiency problem and get rid of

capability of recognizing the part attribute (a combination of part location
and appearance pattern) that has insufficient or zero training data, by
learning the part location and appearance pattern respectively from the
training data that usually mix them in a single label. Extensive experiments on

  kidney transplantation","Conditioning Medicine, 2019",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the biggest challenges in medicine is to dampen the pathophysiological
stress induced by an episode of ischemia. Such stress, due to various
pathological or clinical situations, follows a restriction in blood and oxygen
supply to tissue, causing a shortage of oxygen and nutrients that are required
for cellular metabolism. Ischemia can cause irreversible damage to target
tissue leading to a poor physiological recovery outcome for the patient.
Contrariwise, preconditioning by brief periods of ischemia has been shown in
multiple organs to confer tolerance against subsequent normally lethal
ischemia. By definition, preconditioning of organs must be applied
preemptively. This limits the applicability of preconditioning in clinical
situations, which arise unpredictably, such as myocardial infarction and
stroke. There are, however, clinical situations that arise as a result of
ischemia-reperfusion injury, which can be anticipated, and are therefore
adequate candidates for preconditioning. Organ and more particularly kidney
transplantation, the optimal treatment for suitable patients with end stage
renal disease (ESRD), is a predictable surgery that permits the use of
preconditioning protocols to prepare the organ for subsequent
ischemic/reperfusion stress. It therefore seems crucial to develop appropriate
preconditioning protocols against ischemia that will occur under
transplantation conditions, which up to now mainly referred to mechanical
ischemic preconditioning that triggers innate responses. It is not known if
preconditioning has to be applied to the donor, the recipient, or both. No
drug/target pair has been envisioned and validated in the clinic. Options for
identifying new target/drug pairs involve the use of model animals, such as
drosophila, in which some physiological pathways, such as the management of
oxygen, are highly conserved across evolution. Oxygen is the universal element
of life existence on earth. In this review we focus on a very specific pathway
of pharmacological preconditioning identified in drosophila that was
successfully transferred to mammalian models that has potential application in
human health. Very few mechanisms identified in these model animals have been
translated to an upper evolutionary level. This review highlights the
commonality between oxygen regulation between diverse animals.

applications, such as mobile robot navigation and robot arm manipulation.
However, in large search spaces in which local traps may exist, it remains
challenging to reliably find a path while satisfying real-time constraints.
Efforts to speed up the path search have led to the development of many
practical path-planning algorithms. These algorithms often define a search
heuristic to guide the search towards the goal. The heuristics should be
carefully designed for each specific problem to ensure reliability in the
various situations encountered in the problem. However, it is often difficult
for humans to craft such robust heuristics, and the search performance often
degrades under conditions that violate the heuristic assumption. Rather than
manually designing the heuristics, in this work, we propose a learning approach
to acquire these search heuristics. Our method represents the environment
containing the obstacles as an image, and this image is fed into fully
convolutional neural networks to produce a search heuristic image where every
pixel represents a heuristic value (cost-to-go value to a goal) in the form of
a vertex of a search graph. Training the heuristic is performed using
previously collected planning results. Our preliminary experiments (2D grid
world navigation experiments) demonstrate significant reduction in the search
costs relative to a hand-designed heuristic.

arise from the species dynamics themselves, creating feedback loops between
perturbation and response. A key result is that the fluctuation amplitude and
species diversity are tightly linked, in particular fluctuations enable
dramatically more species to coexist than at equilibrium in the very same

The generalization of Padmanabhan's conjecture to the non-flat universe has
resulted in scepticism about the choice of volume such that the law of
emergence can not be appropriately formulated if one uses proper invariant
volume. The deep connection between the first law of thermodynamics and the law
of emergence \cite{mahith}, motivate us to explore the status of the first law
in a non-flat universe when one uses proper invariant volume. We have shown
that the first law of thermodynamics, $dE = TdS +WdV$ cannot be formulated
properly for a non-flat universe using proper invariant volume. We have also
investigated the status of the first law of the form $-dE = TdS$ in a non-flat
universe. We have shown that the energy change dE within the horizon and the
outward energy flux are not equivalent to each other in a non-flat universe
when we use the proper invariant volume. We have further shown that the
consistency between the above two forms of the first law claimed in Ref.
\cite{caiakb} will hold only with the use of the areal volume of the horizon.
Thus, a consistent formulation of the above two forms of the first law of
thermodynamics demands the use of areal volume.

at exploiting interference as opposed to mitigating it as per conventional

required quality of service at each user. Furthermore, we devise a
low-complexity suboptimal precoding scheme to compute approximate solutions of
the precoding problem. The simulation results reveal that the proposed
coordinated hybrid precoding yields superior performance when compared to the

  System",,,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system, the acquisition of downlink channel state
information (CSI) at base station (BS) is a very challenging task due to the
overwhelming overheads required for downlink training and uplink feedback. In
this paper, we reveal a deterministic uplink-to-downlink mapping function when
the position-to-channel mapping is bijective. Motivated by the universal
approximation theorem, we then propose a sparse complex-valued neural network
(SCNet) to approximate the uplink-to-downlink mapping function. Different from
general deep networks that operate in the real domain, the SCNet is constructed
in the complex domain and is able to learn the complex-valued mapping function
by off-line training. After training, the SCNet is used to directly predict the
downlink CSI based on the estimated uplink CSI without the need of either
downlink training or uplink feedback. Numerical results show that the SCNet
achieves better performance than general deep networks in terms of prediction
accuracy and exhibits remarkable robustness over complicated wireless channels,
demonstrating its great potential for practical deployments.

suppresses LLC but enhances LCC, i.e. causing larger negative values of LCC,

polarization signals in the visible solar spectrum. The amplitude of this
polarization signal is expected to vary at granular spatial scales, due to the
combined action of the Hanle effect and the local anisotropy of the radiation
field. Observing these variations would be of great interest because it would
provide precious information on the small-scale activity of the solar
photosphere. At present, few detections of such spatial variations have been
reported. This is due to the difficulty of these measurements, which require
combining high spatial ($\sim$ 0.1""), spectral ($\leq$ 20 m\AA), and temporal
resolution (< 1 min) with increased polarimetric sensitivity ($\sim$
10$^-$$^4$). Aims. We aim to detect spatial variations at granular scales of
the scattering polarization peak of the Sr~{\sc i} 4607~\AA\ line at different
limb distances, and to study the correlation with the continuum intensity.
Methods.Using the Zurich IMaging POLarimeter (ZIMPOL) system mounted at the
GREGOR telescope and spectrograph in Tenerife, Spain, we carried out
spectro-polarimetric measurements to obtain the four Stokes parameters in the
Sr~{\sc i} line at different limb distances, from $\mu=0.2$ to $\mu=0.8$, on
the solar disk. Results.Spatial variations of the scattering polarization
signal in the Sr~{\sc i} 4607~\AA\ line, with a spatial resolution of about
0.66"", are clearly observed at every $\mu$. The spatial scale of these
variations is comparable to the granular size. A statistical analysis reveals
that the linear scattering polarization amplitude in this Sr~{\sc i} spectral
line is positively correlated with the intensity in the continuum,
corresponding to the granules, at every $\mu$.

determined for 20 stars using the Gaia DR2 parallaxes, high-resolution spectra,
and the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line formation modeling.
A sample of stars with homogeneous data on the abundances of alpha-process
elements has thus been increased to 94. It is shown that applying a non-LTE
approach and classical 1D atmospheric models with spectroscopically determined
surface gravities based on Fe~I and Fe~II lines yields reliable results.
Analysis of the full sample confirms the conclusions of earlier studies
indicating enhancements of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti relative to Fe for halo and
thick-disk stars, and larger enhancements for the thick-disk stars compared to
the thin-disk stars of similar metallicities. The following new results are
obtained. The ratios [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ti/Fe] in the thick disk
remain constant and similar to each other at the level 0.3 when [Fe/H] < -0.4,
and fall off when the metallicity becomes higher, suggesting the onset of the
production of iron in Type Ia supernovae. Halo stars have the same [alpha/Fe]
values independent of their distance (within ~ 8 kpc of the Sun), providing
evidence for a universal evolution of the abundances of alpha-process elements
in different parts of the Galaxy. The enhancements relative to iron for halo
stars are, on average, similar, at the level 0.3 dex, for Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti.
These data are important for constraining the nucleosynthesis models. The
star-to-star scatter of [alpha/Fe] increases for [Fe/H] < -2.6, while the
scatter of the ratios between the different alpha-process elements remains
small, possibly indicating incomplete mixing of nucleosynthesis products at the
epoch of the formation of these stars.

well as to the formation of adsorbates building up distinct surface dipoles.
Besides these results, we detect that under ultraviolet illumination the work
function of the surfaces exposed to HCl decreases by at least $0.2$ eV without
screening of the band bending. We thus attribute the observed surface
photovoltage to a photo-induced modification of the surface dipole. Overall,

properties of nanomaterials is crucial for designing new devices with enhanced
performance. In this regards, doping of metal oxides is a general strategy to
tune size, morphology, charge, lattice, orbital and spin degrees of freedoms
and has been shown to affect nanomaterials properties for photoelectrochemical
water splitting, batteries, catalysis, magnetic applications and optics. Here
we report the role of lattice small polaron in driving the morphological
transition from nearly isotropic to nanowire crystals in Si doped hematite
($\alpha-Fe_2O_3$). Lattice small polaron formation is well evidenced by the
increase of hexagonal strain and degree of distortion of $FeO_6$ showing a
hyperbolic trend with increasing Si content. Local analysis via pair
distribution function highlights an unreported crossover from small to large
polarons, which affects the correlation length of the polaronic distortion from
short to average scales. Ferromagnetic double exchange interactions between
$Fe^{2+}/Fe^{3+}$ species is found to be the driving force of the crossover,
constraining the chaining of chemical bonds along the [110] crystallographic
direction. This promotes the increase in the reticular density of Fe atoms
along the hematite basal plane only, which boosts the anisotropic growth of
nanocrystals with more extended [110] facets. Our results show that magnetic
and electronic interactions drive preferential crystallographic growth in doped
metal oxides, thus providing a new route to design their functional properties.

continuum is largely influenced by Fano interference, leading to important
phenomena such as the existence of bound states in the continuum, fractional

particle statistics in the many-body quantum decay. An overlooked yet essential
requirement to observe Fano interference is time reversal symmetry of the bath.
Here we consider multilevel quantum decay in a bath sustaining unidirectional
(chiral) propagating states, such as in quantum Hall or in Floquet topological
insulators, and show that the chiral nature of scattering states fully
suppresses Fano interference among overlapping resonances. As a result, there
are not bound states in the continuum, quantum decay is complete, and there is
not any signature of particle statistics in the decay process. Nonetheless,
some interesting features are disclosed in the multilevel decay dynamics in a
topological bath, such as the appearance of high-order exceptional points, long
quiescent dynamics followed by a fast decay, and the possibility to observe
damped non-Hermitian Bloch oscillations.

  Device-Free Context Awareness","21 pages",,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Device-free context awareness is important to many applications. There are
two broadly used approaches for device-free context awareness, i.e. video-based
and radio-based. Video-based applications can deliver good performance, but
privacy is a serious concern. Radio-based context awareness has drawn
researchers attention instead because it does not violate privacy and radio
signal can penetrate obstacles. Recently, deep learning has been introduced
into radio-based device-free context awareness and helps boost the recognition
accuracy. The present works design explicit methods for each radio based
application. They also use one additional step to extract features before
conducting classification and exploit deep learning as a classification tool.
The additional initial data processing step introduces unnecessary noise and
information loss. Without initial data processing, it is, however, challenging
to explore patterns of raw signals. In this paper, we are the first to propose
an innovative deep learning based general framework for both signal processing
and classification. The key novelty of this paper is that the framework can be
generalised for all the radio-based context awareness applications. We also
eliminate the additional effort to extract features from raw radio signals. We
conduct extensive evaluations to show the superior performance of our proposed
method and its generalisation.

Differently from many-body localization here the entanglement entropy linearly

series after as few measurements as possible with the highest possible
accuracy. The most critical issue of any eTSC method is to decide when enough
data of a time series has been seen to take a decision: Waiting for more data
points usually makes the classification problem easier but delays the time in
which a classification is made; in contrast, earlier classification has to cope
with less input data, often leading to inferior accuracy. The state-of-the-art
eTSC methods compute a fixed optimal decision time assuming that every times
series has the same defined start time (like turning on a machine). However, in
many real-life applications measurements start at arbitrary times (like
measuring heartbeats of a patient), implying that the best time for taking a
decision varies heavily between time series. We present TEASER, a novel
algorithm that models eTSC as a two two-tier classification problem: In the
first tier, a classifier periodically assesses the incoming time series to
compute class probabilities. However, these class probabilities are only used
as output label if a second-tier classifier decides that the predicted label is
reliable enough, which can happen after a different number of measurements. In
an evaluation using 45 benchmark datasets, TEASER is two to three times earlier
at predictions than its competitors while reaching the same or an even higher
classification accuracy. We further show TEASER's superior performance using
real-life use cases, namely energy monitoring, and gait detection.

maximizing the stationary spreading prevalence in interconnected networks. For
two isolated networks, we maximize the spreading prevalence near the critical
point by choosing multiple interconnecting edges. We present a theoretical
analysis based on the discrete-time Markov chain approach to derive the
approximate optimal strategy. The optimal inter-layer structure predicted by
the strategy maximizes the spreading prevalence, meanwhile minimizes the
spreading outbreak threshold for the interconnected network simultaneously.
Numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world networks show that near the
critical point, the proposed strategy gives better performance than connecting
large degree nodes and randomly connecting.

Here a universal approach is introduced to tune the energy of their

state via dilution in a polar host matrix. The origin of this shift has two
components: constraint of thermally activated triplet diffusion, and
electrostatic interactions between the guest molecules and the polar host. This
allows the emission of mid-green CMA archetypes to be blue shifted without
chemical modifications. Monte-Carlo simulations based on a Marcus-type transfer
integral successfully reproduce the concentration- and temperature-dependent
triplet diffusion process, and reveal a substantial shift in the ensemble
density of states in polar hosts. In gold-bridged CMAs this substantial shift
does not lead to a significant change in luminescence lifetime, thermal
activation energy, reorganisation energy or intersystem crossing rate. These
discoveries thus offer new experimental and theoretical insight in to the

astronomy, have reached such a level of maturity that further improvement
necessitates quantum-noise-evading techniques. Numerous proposals to this end
have been discussed in the literature, e.g., invoking frequency-dependent
squeezing or replacing the current Michelson interferometer topology by that of
the quantum speedmeter. Recently, a proposal based on the linking of a standard
interferometer to a negative-mass spin system via entangled light has offered
an unintrusive and small-scale new approach to quantum noise evasion in GWDs
[Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{121}$, 031101 (2018)]. The solution proposed therein
does not require modifications to the highly refined core optics of the present
GWD design and, when compared to previous proposals, is less prone to losses
and imperfections of the interferometer. In the present article, we refine this
scheme to an extent that the requirements on the auxiliary spin system are
feasible with state-of-the-art implementations. This is accomplished by

Al--Cu--Fe alloys. We model the interatomic interactions using oscillating pair
potentials tuned to the specific alloy system based on a database of density
functional theory (DFT)-derived energies and forces. Favored interatomic
separations align with the geometry of icosahedral motifs that overlap to
create face-centered icosahedral order on a hierarchy of length scales.
Molecular dynamics simulations, supplemented with Monte Carlo steps to swap
chemical species, efficiently sample the configuration space of our models,
which reach up to 9846 atoms. Exchanging temperatures of independent
trajectories (replica exchange) allows us to achieve thermal equilibrium at low
temperatures. By optimizing structure and composition we create structures
whose DFT energies reach to within $\sim$2 meV/atom of the energies of
competing crystal phases. Free energies obtained by adding contributions due to
harmonic and anharmonic vibrations, chemical substitution disorder, phasons,
and electronic excitations, show that the quasicrystal becomes stable against
competing phases at temperatures above 600K. The average structure can be
described succinctly as a cut through atomic surfaces in six-dimensional space
that reveal specific patterns of preferred chemical occupancy. Atomic surface
regions of mixed chemical occupation demonstrate the proliferation of phason
fluctuations, which can be observed in real space through the formation,
dissolution and reformation of large scale icosahedral motifs -- a picture that
is hidden from diffraction refinements due to averaging over the disorder and
consequent loss of information concerning occupancy correlations.

performance of OFDM-based radars, with particular focus on the
fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G) New Radio
(NR) mobile networks' base stations and their utilization for radar/sensing
purposes. First, we address the problem stemming from the unused subcarriers
within the LTE and NR transmit signal passbands, and their impact on
frequency-domain radar processing. Particularly, we formulate and adopt a
computationally efficient interpolation approach to mitigate the effects of
such empty subcarriers in the radar processing. We evaluate the target
detection and the corresponding range and velocity estimation performance
through computer simulations, and show that high-quality target detection as
well as high-precision range and velocity estimation can be achieved.
Especially 5G NR waveforms, through their impressive channel bandwidths and
configurable subcarrier spacing, are shown to provide very good radar/sensing
performance. Then, a fundamental implementation challenge of
transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) isolation in OFDM radars is addressed, with
specific emphasis on shared-antenna cases, where the TX-RX isolation challenges
are the largest. It is confirmed that from the OFDM radar processing
perspective, limited TX-RX isolation is primarily a concern in detection of
static targets while moving targets are inherently more robust to transmitter
self-interference. Properly tailored analog/RF and digital self-interference
cancellation solutions for OFDM radars are also described and implemented, and
shown through RF measurements to be key technical ingredients for practical
deployments, particularly from static and slowly moving targets' point of view.

paths takes an unphysically low energy and dominates the expression, leading to
order-of-magnitude errors in the rate predictions. Nevertheless, semiclassical
instanton theory remains accurate. We conclude that semiclassical instanton
theory can only be obtained directly from the semiclassical limit of the
quantum instanton for symmetric systems. We suggest a modification of the
quantum instanton approach which avoids sampling the spurious path and thus has
a stronger connection to semiclassical instanton theory, giving numerically
accurate predictions even for very asymmetric systems in the low temperature

  We used several MHD snapshots to define the density field of our models.
Sub-millimetre images of the surface brightness and polarisation were obtained
with radiative transfer calculations. We examined the statistics of synthetic
cold clump catalogues and examined the variations of the clump polarisation
fraction p. The clump sizes, aspect ratios, and temperatures in the synthetic
catalogue are similar to the PGCC. The fluxes and column densities are smaller
by a factor of a few. Rather than with an increased dust opacity, this could be
explained by increasing the average column density of the models by a factor of
two to three, close to N(H2)= 10^22 cm-2. When the line of sight is parallel to
the mean magnetic field, the polarisation fraction tends to increase towards
the clump centres, contrary to observations. When the field is perpendicular,
the polarisation fraction tends to decrease towards the clumps, but the drop in
$p$ is small (e.g. from p~8% to p~7%).
  Magnetic field geometry reduces the polarisation fraction in the simulated

predicted by the radiative torque mechanism. The statistical study is not able

predicts star formation in galaxy disks to dominate in the FUV-to-optical,

galaxy mergers and disk instabilities, in an even mix) dominate at higher

pinches off towards a naked singularity due to an instability akin to that of

the quadrupole formula at finite D, and argue that at large enough D ---very
likely for $D\gtrsim 8$, but possibly down to D=6--- the spin-down is too

ultraspinning black holes by solving numerically the time evolution of

separate review on tests of dark matter self-interactions (Adhikari et al., in
prep.).
  Our focus is on astrophysical probes of gravity in the weak-field regime,
ranging from stars to quasilinear cosmological scales. These are complementary
to both strong-field tests and background and linear probes in cosmology. In
particular, the nonlinear screening mechanisms that are an integral part of
viable modified gravity models lead to characteristic signals specifically on
astrophysical scales. The constraining power of these signals is not limited by
cosmic variance, but comes with the challenge of building robust theoretical
models of the nonlinear dynamics of stars, galaxies, clusters and large scale
structure.

astrophysical regime with an eye to using the current and next generation of
observations for tests of gravity. We begin by setting the scene for how
theories beyond General Relativity are expected to behave, focusing primarily
on screened fifth forces. We describe the analytic and numerical techniques for
exploring the pertinent astrophysical systems, as well as the signatures of
modified gravity. With these in hand we present a range of observational tests,

that encrypt and authenticate quantum messages with computational security. The
security definitions used so far in the literature are asymptotic, game-based,
and not known to be composable. We show how to define finite, composable,
computational security for secure quantum message transmission. The new
definitions do not involve any games or oracles, they are directly operational:
a scheme is secure if it transforms an insecure channel and a shared key into
an ideal secure channel from Alice to Bob, i.e., one which only allows Eve to
block messages and learn their size, but not change them or read them. By
modifying the ideal channel to provide Eve with more or less capabilities, one
gets an array of different security notions. By design these transformations
are composable, resulting in composable security.
  Crucially, the new definitions are finite. Security does not rely on the
asymptotic hardness of a computational problem. Instead, one proves a finite
reduction: if an adversary can distinguish the constructed (real) channel from
the ideal one (for some fixed security parameters), then she can solve a finite
instance of some computational problem. Such a finite statement is needed to
make security claims about concrete implementations.
  We then prove that (slightly modified versions of) protocols proposed in the
literature satisfy these composable definitions. And finally, we study the
relations between some game-based definitions and our composable ones. In
particular, we look at notions of quantum authenticated encryption and QCCA2,
and show that they suffer from the same issues as their classical counterparts:
they exclude certain protocols which are arguably secure.

and mixing. We propose in this work a general Lagrangian stochastic model
including velocity and acceleration as dynamical variables for inhomogeneous
turbulent flows. The model takes the form of a diffusion process and the
coefficients of the model are determined via Kolmogorov theory and the
requirement of consistency with the velocity-based models. It is shown that the
present model generalises both the acceleration-based models for homogeneous
flows and the generalised Langevin models for the velocity. The resulting
closed model is applied to a channel flow at high Reynolds number and compared
to experiments as well as direct numerical simulations. A hybrid approach
coupling the stochastic model with a Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) is
used to obtain a self-consistent model, as commonly used in probability density
function methods. Results highlight that most of the acceleration features are
well represented, notably the anisotropy and the strong intermittency. These
results are valuable, since the model allows to improve the modelling of
boundary layers yet remaining relatively simple. It sheds also some light on
the statistical mechanisms at play in the near-wall region.

(OAM) can be used to detect the presence of symmetric or chiral subsets of
particles in disordered media. Using a generalized Mie theory we calculate
analytical expressions for quasi-monochromatic structured light scattered by
dilute distributions of micro- and nanoparticles. These allow us to determine
the angular momentum of the scattered field as a function of the angular
momentum of the incident beam and of the spatial distributions of scattering
particles. Our numerical results show that we can distinguish structured from
random distributions of particles, even when the number density of ordered
particles is a few percent of the total distribution. We also find that the

of the Laguerre-Gaussian modes in relatively dense (but still dilute)

information through molecules and chemical processes is a rapidly growing
interdisciplinary field, which holds the promise to revolutionize how we

theory has had major developments in recent years, more practical aspects in
designing components capable of MC functionalities remain less explored.
Motivated by this, we design a microfluidic MC system with a microfluidic MC
transmitter and a microfluidic MC receiver based on chemical reactions.
Considering existing MC literature on information transmission via molecular
pulse modulation, the proposed microfluidic MC transmitter is capable of
generating continuously predefined pulse-shaped molecular concentrations upon
rectangular triggering signals using chemical reactions inspired by how cells
generate pulse-shaped molecular signals in biology. We further design a
microfluidic MC receiver capable of demodulating a received signal to a
rectangular output signal using a thresholding reaction and an amplifying
reaction. Our chemical reactions-based microfluidic molecular communication
system is reproducible and well-designed, and more importantly, it overcomes
the slow-speed, unreliability, and non-scalability of biological processes in
cells. To reveal design insights, we also derive the theoretical signal
responses for our designed microfluidic transmitter and receiver, which further
facilitate the transmitter design optimization. Our theoretical results are
validated via simulations performed through the COMSOL Multiphysics finite
element solver. We demonstrate the predefined nature of the generated pulse and
the demodulated rectangular signal together with their dependence on design
parameters.

However, developments in variational inference, a general form of approximate

probabilistic modeling to overcome these restrictions: (i) Approximate
probabilistic inference is now possible over a broad class of probabilistic
models containing a large number of parameters, and (ii) scalable inference
methods based on stochastic gradient descent and distributed computation
engines allow to apply probabilistic modeling over massive data sets. One
important practical consequence of these advances is the possibility to include
deep neural networks within a probabilistic model to capture complex non-linear
stochastic relationships between random variables. These advances in
conjunction with the release of novel probabilistic modeling toolboxes have
greatly expanded the scope of application of probabilistic models, and allow
these models to take advantage of the recent strides made by the deep learning

intercept the lines of sight to a distributed population like RGB stars. This
is not a new result: variants obtained using different observations and/or
different wavelengths have already been reported by other studies. We present
two analytic arguments for why it is unlikely that at least 60% of the emitting
dust is in sufficiently compact sources. Therefore it may be necessary to
explore the possibility that the discrepancy between observed values of
R_OBS.tau and theoretical values of R_MODEL.kappa is due to limitations in
existing dust models. PPMAP also allows us to derive optical-depth weighted
mean values for the emissivity index, beta = - dln(kappa_lambda)/dln(lambda),
and the dust temperature, T, denoted betabar and Tbar. We show that, in M31,
R_OBS.tau is anti-correlated with betabar according to R_OBS.tau =
2042(+/-24)-557(+/-10)betabar. If confirmed, this provides a challenging
constraint on the nature of interstellar dust in M31.

strength of the alignments of the spin directions between the neighbor halos
change with the separation distance, $r$. The previous model based on the tidal
torque theory expresses the halo spin-spin correlation function as a power of
the linear density two-point correlation function, $\eta(r)\propto \xi^{n}(r)$,
predicting $n=2$ in the linear regime and $n=1$ in the non-linear regime. Using
a high-resolution N-body simulation, we show that the halo spin-spin
correlation function in fact drops much less rapidly with $r$ than the
prediction of the previous model, finding $\eta(r)$ to be statistically
significant even at $r\ge 10\,h^{-1}$Mpc on the dwarf galaxy scale. Claiming
that the anisotropic tidal effect is responsible for the failure of the
previous model, we propose a new formula for the halo spin-spin correlation

the best-fit parameters turns out to agree excellently with the numerical
results in a broad mass range, $0.05\le M/(10^{11}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})\le 50$,

  We find that the specific choice of metric for determining a simulation's
accuracy is important. Only looking at metrics related to integrals of motions
such as the energy error can overestimate the accuracy of a method. As one
specific example, we show that symplectic correctors do not improve the
accuracy of secular frequencies compared to the standard Wisdom-Holman method
without symplectic correctors, despite the fact that the energy error is three
orders of magnitudes smaller. We present a framework to trace the origin of
this apparent paradox to one term in the shadow Hamiltonian. Specifically, we
find a term that leads to negligible contributions to the energy error but
introduces non-oscillatory errors that result in artificial periastron
precession. This term is the dominant error when determining secular
frequencies of the system. We show that higher order symplectic methods such as
the Wisdom-Holman method with a modified kernel or the SABAC family of
integrators perform significantly better in secularly evolving systems because
they remove this specific term.

pathogen-specific lymphocytes that leave in their wake a long lived population

when during an adaptive immune response those memory cells are produced. In two

(Science, 2013) employed experimental methods that allowed identification of
offspring from individual lymphocytes in vivo, which we call clonal data, at a

mathematical model, Buchholz et al. (Science, 2013) concluded that, if memory
is produced during the expansion phase, memory cell precursors are made before
the effector cells that clear the original pathogen. We sought to determine the
general validity and power of the modeling approach introduced in Buchholz et

it to make it suitable for drawing inferences from more readily available

spectral energy distribution (SED) of a sample of 401 TTS, with Hyperion SED
fitting code using photometric data from the U band to the MIPS band. We used
the SED modeling to distinguish transition disk candidates, full disk systems,
and diskless stars. We classified $52\%$ of the sample as full disk systems,
$41\%$ as diskless stars, and $7\%$ of the systems as transition disk
candidates, among which seven systems are new transition disk candidates
belonging to the NGC 2264 cluster. The sample of transition disk candidates
present dust in the inner disk similar to anemic disks, according to the
$\alpha_{IRAC}$ classification, which shows that anemic disk systems can be
candidate transition disks. We show that the presence of a dust hole in the
inner disk does not stop the accretion process since $82\%$ of transition disk
candidates accrete and show $H\alpha$, UV excess, and mass accretion rates at
the same level as full disk systems. We estimate the inner hole sizes, ranging
from 0.1 to $78AU$, for the sample of transition disk candidates. In only
$18\%$ of the transition disk candidates, the hole size could be explained by
X-ray photoevaporation from stellar radiation.

stochastic nonlinear heat equation (SNLH) with a quadratic nonlinearity, forced
by a fractional derivative (of order $\alpha > 0$) of a space-time white noise.
In particular, we show that the well-posedness theory breaks at $\alpha = \frac
12$ for SNLW and at $\alpha = 1$ for SNLH. This provides a first example
showing that SNLW behaves less favorably than SNLH. (i) As for SNLW, Deya
(2020) essentially proved its local well-posedness for $0 < \alpha < \frac 12$.
We first revisit this argument and establish multilinear smoothing of order
$\frac 14$ on the second order stochastic term in the spirit of a recent work
by Gubinelli, Koch, and Oh (2018). This allows us to simplify the local
well-posedness argument for some range of $\alpha$. On the other hand, when
$\alpha \geq \frac 12$, we show that SNLW is ill-posed in the sense that the
second order stochastic term is not a continuous function of time with values
in spatial distributions. This shows that a standard method such as the Da
Prato-Debussche trick or its variant, based on a higher order expansion, breaks
down for $\alpha \ge \frac 12$. (ii) As for SNLH, we establish analogous
results with a threshold given by $\alpha = 1$.
  These examples show that in the case of rough noises, the existing
well-posedness theory for singular stochastic PDEs breaks down before reaching
the critical values ($\alpha = \frac 34$ in the wave case and $\alpha = 2$ in
the heat case) predicted by the scaling analysis (due to Deng, Nahmod, and Yue

enable Bayesian inference by generating samples from the posterior distribution
over model parameters. Despite the theoretical advantages of Bayesian inference
and the similarity between MCMC and optimization methods, the performance of
sampling methods has so far lagged behind optimization methods for large scale
deep learning tasks. We aim to fill this gap and introduce ATMC, an adaptive
noise MCMC algorithm that estimates and is able to sample from the posterior of
a neural network. ATMC dynamically adjusts the amount of momentum and noise
applied to each parameter update in order to compensate for the use of
stochastic gradients. We use a ResNet architecture without batch normalization

order BFKL evolution can only describe production at highest energies, if
perturbative corrections are increased to unnaturally large values; rendering
this corrections small, the growth with energy is too strong in the LHC region

the presence of high gluon densities in low x the proton, characteristic for

Our model is visually represented through a cube, called Usable Privacy Cube

respectively: rights of the data subjects, privacy principles, and usable
privacy criteria. We slightly reorganize the criteria of EuroPriSe to fit with
the UP Cube model, i.e., we show how EuroPriSe can be viewed as a combination
of only rights and principles, forming the two axes at the basis of our UP
Cube. In this way we also want to bring out two perspectives on privacy: that
of the data subjects and, respectively, that of the controllers/processors. We
define usable privacy criteria based on usability goals that we have extracted
from the whole text of the General Data Protection Regulation. The criteria are
designed to produce measurements of the level of usability with which the goals
are reached. Precisely, we measure effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction,
considering both the objective and the perceived usability outcomes, producing
measures of accuracy and completeness, of resource utilization (e.g., time,
effort, financial), and measures resulting from satisfaction scales. In the
long run, the UP Cube is meant to be the model behind a new certification
methodology capable of evaluating the usability of privacy, to the benefit of
common users. For industries, considering also the usability of privacy would
allow for greater business differentiation, beyond GDPR compliance.

found using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)
telescope. These sources span a dispersion measure (DM) range of 103.5 to 1281
pc cm$^{-3}$. They display varying degrees of activity: six sources were
detected twice, another three times, and one ten times. These eight repeating
FRBs likely represent the bright and/or high-rate end of a distribution of
infrequently repeating sources. For all sources, we determine sky coordinates
with uncertainties of $\sim$10$^\prime$. FRB 180916.J0158+65 has a
burst-averaged DM = $349.2 \pm 0.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and a low DM excess over the
modelled Galactic maximum (as low as $\sim$20 pc cm$^{-3}$); this source also
has a Faraday rotation measure (RM) of $-114.6 \pm 0.6$ rad m$^{-2}$, much
lower than the RM measured for FRB 121102. FRB 181030.J1054+73 has the lowest
DM for a repeater, $103.5 \pm 0.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$, with a DM excess of $\sim$ 70
pc cm$^{-3}$. Both sources are interesting targets for multi-wavelength
follow-up due to their apparent proximity. The DM distribution of our repeater
sample is statistically indistinguishable from that of the first 12 CHIME/FRB
sources that have not repeated. We find, with 4$\sigma$ significance, that
repeater bursts are generally wider than those of CHIME/FRB bursts that have
not repeated, suggesting different emission mechanisms. Our repeater events
show complex morphologies that are reminiscent of the first two discovered
repeating FRBs. The repetitive behavior of these sources will enable
interferometric localizations and subsequent host galaxy identifications.

As these planets consist mostly of hydrogen, observations in hydrogen lines,
such as Ly-alpha and H-alpha, are powerful diagnostics of escape. Here, we
simulate the evolution of atmospheric escape of close-in giant planets and
calculate their associated Ly-alpha and H-alpha transits. We use a
one-dimensional hydrodynamic escape model to compute physical properties of the
atmosphere and a ray-tracing technique to simulate spectroscopic transits. We
consider giant (0.3 and 1M_jup) planets orbiting a solar-like star at 0.045au,
evolving from 10 to 5000 Myr. We find that younger giants show higher rates of
escape, owing to a favourable combination of higher irradiation fluxes and
weaker gravities. Less massive planets show higher escape rates (1e10 -- 1e13
g/s) than those more massive (1e9 -- 1e12 g/s) over their evolution. We
estimate that the 1-M_jup planet would lose at most 1% of its initial mass due
to escape, while the 0.3-M_jup planet, could lose up to 20%. This supports the
idea that the Neptunian desert has been formed due to significant mass loss in
low-gravity planets. At younger ages, we find that the mid-transit Ly-alpha
line is saturated at line centre, while H-alpha exhibits transit depths of at
most 3 -- 4% in excess of their geometric transit. While at older ages,
Ly-alpha absorption is still significant (and possibly saturated for the lower
mass planet), the H-alpha absorption nearly disappears. This is because the
extended atmosphere of neutral hydrogen becomes predominantly in the ground
state after ~1.2 Gyr.

powerful adversary---because there may indeed be great variability in both
attackers' powers and their context.
  However, no weakening or contextual discounting of attackers' power is

of attackers---without any change assumed in attackers' powers.
  Because they more precisely bound the worst-case privacy loss, these improved
analyses can greatly strengthen the differential-privacy upper-bound
guarantees---sometimes lowering the differential-privacy epsilon by
orders-of-magnitude. As such, to the casual eye, these analyses may appear to
imply a reduced privacy loss. This is a false perception: the privacy loss of
any concrete mechanism cannot change with the choice of a worst-case-loss

adoption of computational models and artificial intelligence in preclinical
drug discovery, as well as to foster its application to guide decision making
in clinical settings. Among the large number of algorithms developed over the
last decades to compute prediction errors, Conformal Prediction (CP) has gained
increasing attention in the computational drug discovery community. A major
reason for its recent popularity is the ease of interpretation of the computed
prediction errors in both classification and regression tasks. For instance, at
a confidence level of 90% the true value will be within the predicted
confidence intervals in at least 90% of the cases. This so called validity of
conformal predictors is guaranteed by the robust mathematical foundation
underlying CP. The versatility of CP relies on its minimal computational
footprint, as it can be easily coupled to any machine learning algorithm at
little computational cost. In this review, we summarize underlying concepts and
practical applications of CP with a particular focus on virtual screening and
activity modelling, and list open source implementations of relevant software.
Finally, we describe the current limitations in the field, and provide a
perspective on future opportunities for CP in preclinical and clinical drug
discovery.

fields dominate the energy density of the Universe in a post-inflationary
epoch. For the case of a single light modulus it has been shown that
considering the evolution of a specific scale from the time of its Hubble
crossing during inflation to the present time, a relation can be obtained among
the lightest modulus mass, the reheating parameters ($T_{\text{reh}}$,
$\bar{w}_{\text{reh}}$ and $N_{\text{reh}}$) and the inflationary observables.
By paying closer attention to the role of the $\bar{w}_{\text{reh}}$, we obtain
more stringent constraints on the value of the modulus mass and the reheating
parameters using the CMB data. Next, the analysis is extended to include
features in the inflaton potential as a source of CMB low multipole anomalies,
which further constrains the mass of the modulus to be substantially higher
than without such a constraint. By both considerations and for several
inflation models considered, we find a constraint on the mass of the lightest
modulus particle, $m_{\chi}$, generically $\gtrsim10^{15}$GeV, with possible
low values $\sim10^{12}$GeV. While a simplification of the reheating phase is
assumed, the bounds are reliably suggestive, and the study may be taken as a
demonstration that substantial knowledge about reheating phase buried deep in

  Functional Difference Detection",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Significant progress has been made using fMRI to characterize the brain
changes that occur in ASD, a complex neuro-developmental disorder. However, due
to the high dimensionality and low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI, embedding
informative and robust brain regional fMRI representations for both graph-level
classification and region-level functional difference detection tasks between
ASD and healthy control (HC) groups is difficult. Here, we model the whole
brain fMRI as a graph, which preserves geometrical and temporal information and
use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn from the graph-structured fMRI data.
We investigate the potential of including mutual information (MI) loss
(Infomax), which is an unsupervised term encouraging large MI of each nodal
representation and its corresponding graph-level summarized representation to
learn a better graph embedding. Specifically, this work developed a pipeline
including a GNN encoder, a classifier and a discriminator, which forces the
encoded nodal representations to both benefit classification and reveal the
common nodal patterns in a graph. We simultaneously optimize graph-level
classification loss and Infomax. We demonstrated that Infomax graph embedding
improves classification performance as a regularization term. Furthermore, we
found separable nodal representations of ASD and HC groups in prefrontal
cortex, cingulate cortex, visual regions, and other social, emotional and
execution related brain regions. In contrast with GNN with classification loss
only, the proposed pipeline can facilitate training more robust ASD
classification models. Moreover, the separable nodal representations can detect
the functional differences between the two groups and contribute to revealing
new ASD biomarkers.

our approach involves training a seed model on the limited amount of labelled

mechanism to obtain the best hypothesized output, further used to retrain the
seed model. However, uncertainties of the model may not be well captured with a
single hypothesis. As opposed to this technique, we apply a dropout mechanism
to capture the uncertainty by obtaining multiple hypothesized text transcripts
of an speech recording. We assume that the diversity of automatically generated
transcripts for an utterance will implicitly increase the reliability of the
model. Finally, the data selection process is also applied on these
hypothesized transcripts to reduce the uncertainty. Experiments on freely

proposed approach significantly reduces ASR errors, compared to the baseline

hardness results for three central high-dimensional statistics problems,
implying a statistical-computational gap induced by robustness, a
detection-recovery gap and a universality principle for these gaps. A main
feature of our approach is to map to these problems via a common intermediate
problem that we introduce, which we call Imbalanced Sparse Gaussian Mixtures.
We assume the planted clique conjecture for a version of the planted clique
problem where the position of the planted clique is mildly constrained, and
from this obtain the following computational lower bounds: (1) a $k$-to-$k^2$
statistical-computational gap for robust sparse mean estimation, providing the
first average-case evidence for a conjecture of Li (2017) and Balakrishnan et
al. (2017); (2) a tight lower bound for semirandom planted dense subgraph,
which shows that a semirandom adversary shifts the detection threshold in
planted dense subgraph to the conjectured recovery threshold; and (3) a
universality principle for $k$-to-$k^2$ gaps in a broad class of sparse mixture
problems that includes many natural formulations such as the spiked covariance
model.
  Our main approach is to introduce several average-case techniques to produce
structured and Gaussianized versions of an input graph problem, and then to
rotate these high-dimensional Gaussians by matrices carefully constructed from
hyperplanes in $\mathbb{F}_r^t$. For our universality result, we introduce a
new method to perform an algorithmic change of measure tailored to sparse
mixtures. We also provide evidence that the mild promise in our variant of
planted clique does not change the complexity of the problem.

valley fold which are parallel to each other. In this paper we present a new
type of 3D gadgets with simple outgoing pleats in origami extrusions and their
construction. Our 3D gadgets are downward compatible with the conventional
pyramid-supported gadgets developed by Calros Natan as a generalization of the
cube gadget, in the sense that in many cases we can replace the conventional

not always possible. We can also change angles of the outgoing pleats under
certain conditions. Unlike the conventional pyramid-supported 3D gadgets, the
new ones have flat back sides above the ambient paper, and thus we can make
flat-foldable origami extrusions. Furthermore, since our new 3D gadgets are
less interfering with adjacent gadgets than the conventional ones, we can use
wider pleats at one time to make the extrusion higher. For example, we prove
that the maximal height of the prism of any convex polygon (resp. any triangle)

In order to do so, We propose a Hard-Mining loss by increasing the loss for

Consequently, three-dimensional imaging results in axial resolution being

usually require complicated optics and extreme spatial stability. A
straightforward way to eliminate anisotropic resolution is to fuse images
recorded from multiple viewing directions achieved mostly by the mechanical
rotation of the entire sample. In the presented approach, multiview imaging of
single cells is implemented by rotating them around an axis perpendicular to
the optical axis by means of holographic optical tweezers. For this, the cells
are indirectly trapped and manipulated with special microtools made with
two-photon polymerization. The cell is firmly attached to the microtool and is
precisely manipulated with 6 degrees of freedom. The total control over the
cells position allows for its multiview fluorescence imaging from arbitrarily
selected directions. The image stacks obtained this way are combined into one
3D image array with a special image processing algorithm resulting in isotropic
optical resolution. The presented tool and manipulation scheme can be readily

  Cost Prediction","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1905.11804",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Developing a reliable parametric cost model at the conceptual stage of the
project is crucial for projects managers and decision-makers. Existing methods,
such as probabilistic and statistical algorithms have been developed for
project cost prediction. However, these methods are unable to produce accurate
results for conceptual cost prediction due to small and unstable data samples.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms include
numerous models and algorithms for supervised regression applications.
Therefore, a comparison analysis for AI models is required to guide
practitioners to the appropriate model. The study focuses on investigating
twenty artificial intelligence (AI) techniques which are conducted for cost
modeling such as fuzzy logic (FL) model, artificial neural networks (ANNs),
multiple regression analysis (MRA), case-based reasoning (CBR), hybrid models,
and ensemble methods such as scalable boosting trees (XGBoost). Field canals
improvement projects (FCIPs) are used as an actual case study to analyze the
performance of the applied ML models. Out of 20 AI techniques, the results
showed that the most accurate and suitable method is XGBoost with 9.091% and
0.929 based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and adjusted R2. Nonlinear
adaptability, handling missing values and outliers, model interpretation and
uncertainty have been discussed for the twenty developed AI models. Keywords:
Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, ensemble methods, XGBoost,
evolutionary fuzzy rules generation, Conceptual cost, and parametric cost
model.

treatment response monitoring. Magnetic resonance imaging is typically used
throughout the patient pathway because routine structural imaging provides
detailed anatomical and pathological information and advanced techniques
provide additional physiological detail. Following image feature extraction,
machine learning allows accurate classification in a variety of scenarios.
Machine learning also enables image feature extraction de novo although the low
prevalence of brain tumours makes such approaches challenging. Much research is
applied to determining molecular profiles, histological tumour grade and
prognosis at the time that patients first present with a brain tumour.
Following treatment, differentiating a treatment response from a post-treatment
related effect is clinically important and also an area of study. Most of the
evidence is low level having been obtained retrospectively and in single
centres.
