millimeter-wave wideband communication systems that employ
electrically-steerable and narrow beam antenna arrays. Three important channel
modeling components, spatial consistency, human blockage, and outdoor-to-indoor
penetration loss, were proposed in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
Release 14 for mmWave communication system design. This paper presents NYUSIM
2.0, an improved channel simulator which can simulate spatially consistent
channel realizations based on the existing drop-based channel simulator NYUSIM
1.6.1. A geometry-based approach using multiple reflection surfaces is proposed
to generate spatially correlated and time-variant channel coefficients. Using
results from 73 GHz pedestrian measurements for human blockage, a four-state
Markov model has been implemented in NYUSIM to simulate dynamic human blockage
shadowing loss. To model the excess path loss due to penetration into
buildings, a parabolic model for outdoor-to-indoor penetration loss has been
adopted from the 5G Channel Modeling special interest group and implemented in
NYUSIM 2.0. This paper demonstrates how these new modeling capabilities
reproduce realistic data when implemented in Monte Carlo fashion using NYUSIM
2.0, making it a valuable measurement-based channel simulator for
fifth-generation and beyond mmWave communication system design and evaluation.

galaxies are possible analogs of the sources that reionized the universe. We
present HST COS spectra of 13 of the most highly ionized GPs, with [O III]/[O
II]=6-35, and investigate correlations between Ly-alpha, galaxy properties, and
low-ionization UV lines. Galaxies with high [O III]/[O II] have higher H-alpha
equivalent widths (EWs), and high intrinsic Ly-alpha production may explain the
prevalence of high Ly-alpha EWs among GPs. While Ly-alpha escape fraction is
closely linked to low gas covering fractions, implying a clumpy gas geometry,
narrow Ly-alpha velocity peak separation (delta_v,LyA) correlates with the
ionization state, suggesting a density-bounded geometry. We therefore suggest
that delta_v,LyA may trace the residual transparency of low-column-density
pathways. Metallicity is associated with both [O III]/[O II] and delta_v,LyA.
This trend may result from catastrophic cooling around low-metallicity star
clusters, which generates a compact geometry of dense clouds within a
low-density inter-clump medium. We find that the relative strength of
low-ionization UV emission to absorption correlates with Ly-alpha emission
strength and is related to Ly-alpha profile shape. However, as expected for
optically thin objects, the GPs with the lowest delta_v,LyA show both weak
low-ionization emission and weak absorption. The strengths of the
low-ionization absorption and emission lines in a stacked spectrum do not
correspond to any individual spectrum. Galaxies with high [O III]/[O II]
contain a high fraction of LyC emitter candidates, but [O III]/[O II] alone is
an insufficient diagnostic of LyC escape.

properties for common building materials (drywall and clear glass) are
carefully studied at 28, 73, and 140 GHz using a wideband sliding correlation
based channel sounder system with rotatable narrow-beam horn antennas.
Reflection coefficient is shown to linearly increase as the incident angle
increases, and lower reflection loss (e.g., stronger reflections) are observed
as frequencies increase for a given incident angle. Although backscatter from
drywall is present at 28, 73, and 140 GHz, smooth surfaces (like drywall) are
shown to be modeled as a simple reflected surface, since the scattered power is
20 dB or more below the reflected power over the measured range of frequency
and angles. Partition loss tends to increase with frequency, but the amount of
loss is material dependent. Both clear glass and drywall are shown to induce a
depolarizing effect, which becomes more prominent as frequency increases.
Indoor propagation measurements and large-scale indoor path loss models at 140

observed at 28 and 73 GHz. The measurements and models in this paper can be

improve users satisfaction. We also introduce an initial cross layer hybrid
method that combines quality adaptation of variable bitrate video streaming
over the HTTP protocol at the client side and SDN based dynamical routing. This
scheme is enabled by the Software Defined Networking architecture that is now
being considered as an emerging paradigm that disassociates the forwarding
process from the routing process. SDN brings flexibility and the ability to
flexibly change routing solutions, in turn resulting in dynamically improving
the services provided in the application layer. Our experimental results show
that the proposed solution offers significantly higher overall bitrates as well
as smoother viewing experience than existing methods.

on a plane were discussed by Sergey Chaplygin, whose 150th anniversary we
celebrate this year. The Chaplygin top is a non-integrable system, with a
colourful range of interesting motions. A special case of this system was
studied by Edward Routh, who showed that it is integrable.
  The Routh sphere has centre of mass offset from the geometric centre, but it
has an axis of symmetry through both these points, and equal moments of inertia
about all axes orthogonal to the symmetry axis. There are three constants of
motion: the total energy and two quantities involving the angular momenta.
  It is straightforward to demonstrate that these quantities, known as the
Jellett and Routh constants, are integrals of the motion. However, their
physical significance has not been fully understood. In this paper, we show how
the integrals of the Routh sphere arise from Emmy Noether's invariance
identity. We derive expressions for the infinitesimal symmetry transformations
associated with these constants. We find the finite version of these symmetries
and provide their geometrical interpretation.
  As a further demonstration of the power and utility of this method, we find
the Noether symmetries and corresponding Noether integrals for a system
introduced recently: the Chaplygin ball on a rotating turntable, confirming
that the known integrals are directly obtained from Noether's theorem.

attractive, it is previously known that all steady states must be radially
decreasing up to a translation, but uniqueness (for a given mass) within the
radial class was open, except for some special interaction potentials. For
general attractive potentials, we show that the uniqueness/non-uniqueness
criteria are determined by the power of the degenerate diffusion, with the
critical power being $m = 2$. In the case $m \ge 2$, we show that for any
attractive potential the steady state is unique for a fixed mass. In the case
$1 < m < 2$, we construct examples of smooth attractive potentials, such that
there are infinitely many radially decreasing steady states of the same mass.
For the uniqueness proof, we develop a novel interpolation curve between two
radially decreasing densities, and the key step is to show that the interaction
energy is convex along this curve for any attractive interaction potential,
which is of independent interest.

polychromatic, vectorial, optical vortex using multiple layers of liquid
crystal polymers. While this approach has been the most successful thus far,
current fabrication processes achieve retardance errors of 0.1-1.0$^\circ$,

by $M_{inf}\ll H \ll M_{heavy}$, where $M_{inf}$ can correspond to several or a
single light field and $M_{heavy}\,\,\,$ corresponds to any heavy field that
might be integrated out if it satisfies suitable conditions. This is at the
heart of the so called $\eta$-problem in inflation, since large contributions
to the masses of the inflatons might spoil the slow-roll conditions required
for inflation. We show that, while this is an unavoidable conclusion in single
field inflation, in multifield inflation, heavy fields as defined above, may be
fully responsible for a successful period of what we call fat slow-roll
inflation. Moreover we show that in this scenario, the turning rate of the
inflationary trajectory, $\Omega/H$, is larger than one. Thus, the
$\eta$-problem is evaded with large turns in fat inflation. Depending on the
perturbations' mass spectra, cosmological predictions will differ either
slightly or largely with respect to those of the single field case. We
illustrate this scenario in a concrete example in Type IIB string flux
compactifications, where a probe D5-brane moving along the angular and radial
directions in a warped throat drives fat D5-brane natural inflation. An
instantaneous superplanckian decay constant can be defined, consistent with our
low energy approximations, thanks to the strong warping of the geometry. We
compute the cosmological observables, which differ from the single field case.
We also discuss fat inflation in the context of recently proposed swampland de
Sitter conjectures.

specifying complete domain models is too high, which impedes the applicability
of planning technology in many real-world domains. Although there have many
learning systems that help automatically learning domain models, most existing
work assumes that the input traces are completely correct. A more realistic
situation is that the plan traces are disordered and noisy, such as plan traces
described by natural language. In this paper we propose and evaluate an
approach for doing this. Our approach takes as input a set of plan traces with
disordered actions and noise and outputs action models that can best explain
the plan traces. We use a MAX-SAT framework for learning, where the constraints
are derived from the given plan traces. Unlike traditional action models
learners, the states in plan traces can be partially observable and noisy as
well as the actions in plan traces can be disordered and parallel. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a systematic empirical
evaluation with both IPC domains and the real-world dataset extracted from
natural language documents.

light of these concerns, several studies have proposed to detect
machine-generated fake news by capturing their stylistic differences from
human-written text. These approaches, broadly termed stylometry, have found
success in source attribution and misinformation detection in human-written

machine-generated misinformation. While humans speak differently when trying to
deceive, LMs generate stylistically consistent text, regardless of underlying

identifying text provenance, it fails to distinguish legitimate LM applications
from those that introduce false information. We create two benchmarks

also computationally expensive. By learning a symmetric distributed neural

achieve the best of both worlds: the neural controllers have high performance
(on par with the MPC controllers) and high efficiency. Our experimental results

prerequisite for critical scientific and technological advances. The dramatic
progress made by modern probe techniques to uncover the microscopic structure
of matter is fundamentally rooted in our control of two defining traits of
quantum mechanics: discreteness of physical properties and interference
phenomena. Magnetic Resonance Imaging, for instance, exploits the fact that
protons have spin and can absorb photons at frequencies that depend on the
medium to image the anatomy and physiology of living systems. Scattering
techniques, in which photons, electrons, protons or neutrons are used as
probes, make use of quantum interference to directly image the spatial position
of individual atoms, their magnetic structure, or even unveil their concomitant
dynamical correlations. None of these probes have so far exploited a unique
characteristic of the quantum world: entanglement. Here we introduce a
fundamentally new quantum probe, an entangled neutron beam, where individual
neutrons can be entangled in spin, trajectory and energy. Its tunable
entanglement length from nanometers to microns and energy differences from peV
to neV will enable new investigations of microscopic magnetic correlations in
systems with strongly entangled phases, such as those believed to emerge in
unconventional superconductors. We develop an interferometer to prove
entanglement of these distinguishable properties of the neutron beam by
observing clear violations of both Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Mermin
contextuality inequalities in the same experimental setup. Our work opens a
pathway to a future era of entangled neutron scattering in matter.

and magnetic field distributions, wind profiles, CR injection rates, and
stellar radiation fields, we simultaneously fit both the integrated gamma-ray

along M82's minor axis. We explore the resulting constraints on the gas

advection profile. In accord with earlier one-zone studies, we generically find
low central CR pressures, strong secondary electron/positron production, and an
important role for relativistic bremsstrahlung losses in shaping the
synchrotron spectrum. We find that the relatively low central CR density
produces CR pressure gradients that are weak compared to gravity, strongly
limiting the role of CRs in driving M82's fast and mass-loaded galactic
outflow. Our models require strong magnetic fields and advection speeds of

at intermediate amplitude of the quasiperiodic modulation, and a transition to
a phase with a diverging density of states and sub-diffusive transport when the
quasiperiodic hopping is strongest. We further demonstrate that the

flat bands with a dramatically renormalized bandwidth in the metallic phase
similar to the phenomena of the band structure of twisted bilayer graphene at
the magic angle. We characterize the nature of this transition numerically as
well as analytically in terms of the formation of a band of topological zero
modes. For pure quasiperiodic hopping, we provide strong numerical evidence
that the low-energy density of states develops a divergence and the eigenstates

fossil records of the early solar system. In order to form chondrules,
chondrule precursors must be heated to temperatures much higher than the
typical conditions in the current asteroid belt. One proposed mechanism for
chondrule heating is the passage through bow shocks of highly eccentric
planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk in the early solar system. However, it
is difficult for planetesimals to gain and maintain such high eccentricities.
In this paper, we present a new scenario in which planetesimals in the asteroid
belt region are excited to high eccentricities by the Jovian sweeping secular
resonance in a depleting disk, leading to efficient formation of chondrules. We
study the orbital evolution of planetesimals in the disk using semi-analytic
models and numerical simulations. We investigate the dependence of eccentricity
excitation on the planetesimal's size as well as the physical environment, and
calculate the probability for chondrule formation. We find that 50 - 2000 km
planetesimals can obtain eccentricities larger than 0.6 and cause effective
chondrule heating. Most chondrules form in high velocity shocks, in low density
gas, and in the inner disk. The fraction of chondrule precursors which become
chondrules is about 4 - 9 % between 1.5 - 3 AU. Our model implies that the disk
depletion timescale is $\tau_\mathrm{dep}\approx 1~\mathrm{Myr}$, comparable to
the age spread of chondrules; and that Jupiter formed before chondrules, no
more than 0.7 Myr after the formation of the CAIs.

while all other symmetries, exact or approximate, are essentially dictated by
theoretical consistency with the particle spectrum. On the other hand, many
models of dark matter exist that rely upon the addition of new added global
symmetries in order to stabilize the dark matter particle and/or achieve the
correct abundance. In this work we begin a systematic exploration into truly
natural models of dark matter, organized by only relativity and quantum
mechanics, without the appeal to any additional global symmetries, no
fine-tuning, and no small parameters. We begin by reviewing how singlet dark
sectors based on spin 0 or spin ${1\over2}$ should readily decay, while pure
strongly coupled spin 1 models have an overabundance problem. This inevitably
leads us to construct chiral models with spin ${1\over2}$ particles charged
under confining spin 1 particles. This leads to stable dark matter candidates
that are analogs of baryons, with a confinement scale that can be naturally
$\mathcal{O}(100)$TeV. This leads to the right freeze-out abundance by
annihilating into massless unconfined dark fermions. The minimal model involves
a dark copy of $SU(3)\times SU(2)$ with 1 generation of chiral dark quarks and
leptons. The presence of massless dark leptons can potentially give rise to a
somewhat large value of $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$ during BBN. In order to not
upset BBN one may either appeal to a large number of heavy degrees of freedom
beyond the Standard Model, or to assume the dark sector has a lower reheat
temperature than the visible sector, which is also natural in this framework.
This reasoning provides a robust set of dark matter models that are entirely
natural. Some are concrete realizations of the nightmare scenario in which dark
matter may be very difficult to detect, which may impact future search
techniques.

dark matter (DM) halo in DM-only simulations using a machine trained on
high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. As an example, we use the
IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation of a $(75 \,\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$ volume
to train our machine to predict e.g., stellar mass and star formation rate in a
galaxy-sized halo based purely on its DM content. An extremely randomized tree
(ERT) algorithm is used together with multiple novel improvements we introduce
here such as a refined error function in machine training and two-stage
learning. Aided by these improvements, our model demonstrates a significantly
increased accuracy in predicting baryonic properties compared to prior attempts
--- in other words, the machine better mimics IllustrisTNG's galaxy-halo
correlation. By applying our machine to the MultiDark-Planck DM-only simulation
of a large $(1 \,\,h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volume, we then validate the pipeline
that rapidly generates a galaxy catalogue from a DM halo catalogue using the
correlations the machine found in IllustrisTNG. We also compare our galaxy
catalogue with the ones produced by popular semi-analytic models (SAMs). Our
so-called machine-assisted semi-simulation model (MSSM) is shown to be largely
compatible with SAMs, and may become a promising method to transplant the
baryon physics of galaxy-scale hydrodynamic calculations onto a larger-volume
DM-only run. We discuss the benefits that machine-based approaches like this
entail, as well as suggestions to raise the scientific potential of such
approaches.

amplitudes. In the SMEFT, there are 64 independent operators at mass dimension
eight that are quartic in bosons (either Higgs or gauge fields) and that
contain four derivatives and/or field strengths, including both CP-conserving
and CP-violating operators. Using analytic dispersion relation arguments for
two-to-two bosonic scattering amplitudes, we derive 27 independent bounds on
the sign or magnitude of the couplings. We show that these bounds also follow
as a consequence of causality of signal propagation in nonvacuum SM
backgrounds. These bounds come in two qualitative forms: i) positivity of
(various linear combinations of) couplings of CP-even operators and ii) upper
bounds on the magnitude of CP-odd operators in terms of (products of) CP-even
couplings. We exhibit various classes of example completions, which all satisfy
our EFT bounds. These bounds have consequences for current and future particle
physics experiments, as part of the observable parameter space is inconsistent
with causality and analyticity. To demonstrate the impact of our bounds, we
consider applications both to SMEFT constraints derived at colliders and to
limits on the neutron electric dipole moment, highlighting the connection
between such searches suggested by infrared consistency.

processes. In this paper we introduce our recently developed Chemical Kinetic
Model (\texttt{ChemKM}). We show that the results of our HD189733b model are in
good agreement with previously published results, except at $\mu$bar regime,
where molecular diffusion and photochemistry are the dominant processes. We
thus recommend careful consideration of these processes when abundances at the
top of the atmosphere are desired. We also propose a new metric for a
quantitative measure of quenching levels. By applying this metric, we find that
quenching pressure decreases with the effective temperature of planets, but it
also varies significantly with other atmospheric parameters such as [Fe/H],
log(g), and C/O. In addition, we find that the ""Methane Valley"", a region
between 800 and 1500K where above a certain C/O threshold value a greater
chance of CH$_4$ detection is expected, still exists after including the
vertical mixing. The first robust CH$_4$ detection on an irradiated planet
(HD102195b) places this object within this region; supporting our prediction.
We also investigate the detectability of disequilibrium spectral fingerprints
by JWST, and suggest focusing on the targets with T$_{eff}$ between 1000 and
1800K, orbiting around M-dwarfs, having low surface gravity but high
metallicity and a C/O ratio value around unity. Finally, constructing Spitzer
color-maps suggests that the main two color-populations are largely insensitive
to the vertical mixing. Therefore any deviation of observational points from
these populations are likely due to the presence of clouds and not
disequilibrium processes. However, some cold planets (T$_{eff}<$900K) with very
low C/O ratios ($<$0.25) show significant deviations; making these planets
interesting cases for further investigation.

bolometric corrections ($K_{bol}=L_{bol}/L_{X}$). We compared the resulting
$\alpha_{ox}$ and $K_{bol}$ distributions with the results found for QSO
samples at lower redshift. Finally, we performed a basic X-ray spectral
analysis of the brightest $z>6$ QSOs to derive their individual photon indices,
and joint spectral analysis of the whole sample to estimate the average photon
index. We confirm a lack of significant evolution of $\alpha_{ox}$ with

of an increasing bolometric correction with increasing luminosity found for

still consistent with, typical QSOs at $z=1-6$. All these results point toward
a lack of substantial evolution of the inner accretion-disk/hot-corona

species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of
ecological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical
trait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly
simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast
conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine
Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural

and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions
based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species
interactions. We find that the best ML models can successfully predict species
interactions in plant-pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial
margin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the
causally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case
studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a
global plant-pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible
trait-matching rules for a plant-hummingbird network, without any prior
assumptions. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over
traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We
anticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types.
More generally, our results highlight the potential of machine learning and
artificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as

It can cause a variety of correlated and nonlocal crosstalk errors that can be

errors requires understanding, modeling, and detecting them. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive framework for crosstalk errors and a protocol for
detecting and localizing them. We give a rigorous definition of crosstalk
errors that captures a wide range of disparate physical phenomena that have
been called ""crosstalk"", and a concrete model for crosstalk-free quantum
processors. Errors that violate this model are crosstalk errors. Next, we give
an equivalent but purely operational (model-independent) definition of
crosstalk errors. Using this definition, we construct a protocol for detecting
a large class of crosstalk errors in a multi-qubit processor by finding
conditional dependencies between observed experimental probabilities. It is
highly efficient, in the sense that the number of unique experiments required
scales at most cubically, and very often quadratically, with the number of
qubits. We demonstrate the protocol using simulations of 2-qubit and 6-qubit

considerations are used to determine the ground-state structure of the theory.
The anomalies, which are present for most values of $N$, are matched by
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. We find that massless $2$d adjoint QCD
confines for $N >2$, except for test charges of $N$-ality $N/2$, which are
deconfined. In other words, $\mathbb Z_N$ center symmetry is unbroken for odd
$N$ and spontaneously broken to $\mathbb Z_{N/2}$ for even $N$. All of these
results are confirmed by explicit calculations on small $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$.
We also show that this non-supersymmetric theory exhibits exact Bose-Fermi
degeneracies for all states, including the vacua, when $N$ is even.
Furthermore, for most values of $N$, $2$d massive adjoint QCD describes a
non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of matter, including
certain cases where the number of interacting Majorana fermions is a multiple

torus. We show that the naive counts of rational curves in $U$ uniquely
determine a commutative associative algebra equipped with a compatible
multilinear form. This proves a variant of the Frobenius structure conjecture
by Gross-Hacking-Keel in mirror symmetry, and the spectrum of this algebra is
supposed to give the hypothetical mirror family. Although the statement of our
theorem involves only elementary algebraic geometry, our proof employs
Berkovich non-archimedean analytic methods. We construct the structure
constants of the algebra via counting non-archimedean analytic disks in the
analytification of $U$. We establish various properties of the counting,
notably deformation invariance, symmetry, gluing formula and convexity. In the
special case when $U$ is a Fock-Goncharov skew-symmetric X-cluster variety, we
prove that our algebra generalizes, and gives a direct geometric construction
of, the mirror algebra of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich. The comparison is
proved via a canonical scattering diagram constructed from counts of
infinitesimal non-archimedean analytic cylinders, without using the
Kontsevich-Soibelman algorithm. Several combinatorial conjectures of GHKK, as
well as the positivity in the Laurent phenomenon, follow readily from the
geometric description.

2015 to study these short delays further. Analyzing high quality data that span
time scales between hours and decades, we find that neutral and ionized
absorption contribute significantly to the spectral shape. Accounting for their
effects, we find no evidence for a relativistic reflection component, contrary
to early work. Energy-dependent lags are significantly measured in the new
data, but with an energy profile that does not resemble a broad iron line, in
contrast to the old data. The complex lag-energy spectra, along with the lack
of strong evidence for a relativistic spectral component, suggest that the
energy-dependent lags are produced by absorption effects. The long term
spectral variations provide new details on the variability of the narrow Fe
K$\alpha$ line . We find that its variations are correlated with, and delayed
with respect to, the primary X-ray continuum. We measure a delay of $\tau=
3.3^{+1.8}_{-0.7}$ days, implying an origin in the inner broad line region

differs slightly from the optical BLR.

classify all the distinct regimes along which the observed dark matter relic

Among these, 4 regimes are new and correspond to regimes in which the DM

three-dimensional fractured reservoirs as well as deformation of fractures and
the reservoir in general. We present validation by benchmarks for flow,
poroelasticity and fracture deformation in fractured porous media. The
flexibility of the framework is then illustrated by simulations of fully

important problems in function approximation: avoiding curse of dimensionality
and estimating the degree of approximation for out-of-sample extension in
manifold learning. We consider an abstract (shallow) network that includes, for
example, neural networks, radial basis function networks, and kernels on data
defined manifolds used for function approximation in various settings. A deep
network is obtained by a composition of the shallow networks according to a
directed acyclic graph, representing the architecture of the deep network.
  In this paper, we prove dimension independent bounds for approximation by
shallow networks in the very general setting of what we have called
$G$-networks on a compact metric measure space, where the notion of dimension
is defined in terms of the cardinality of maximal distinguishable sets,
generalizing the notion of dimension of a cube or a manifold. Our techniques
give bounds that improve without saturation with the smoothness of the kernel
involved in an integral representation of the target function. In the context
of manifold learning, our bounds provide estimates on the degree of
approximation for an out-of-sample extension of the target function to the
ambient space.
  One consequence of our theorem is that without the requirement of robust
parameter selection, deep networks using a non-smooth activation function such
as the ReLU, do not provide any significant advantage over shallow networks in
terms of the degree of approximation alone.

infeasible. Aggregated Relational Data (ARD), which capture information about a
social network by asking a respondent questions of the form ``How many people

network data is not possible. Rather than asking about connections between each
pair of individuals directly, ARD collects the number of contacts the
respondent knows with a given trait. Despite widespread use and a growing
literature on ARD methodology, there is still no systematic understanding of
when and why ARD should accurately recover features of the unobserved network.
This paper provides such a characterization by deriving conditions under which
statistics about the unobserved network (or functions of these statistics like
regression coefficients) can be consistently estimated using ARD. We do this by
first providing consistent estimates of network model parameters for three
commonly used probabilistic models: the beta-model with node-specific
unobserved effects, the stochastic block model with unobserved community
structure, and latent geometric space models with unobserved latent locations.
A key observation behind these results is that cross-group link probabilities
for a collection of (possibly unobserved) groups identifies the model
parameters, meaning ARD is sufficient for parameter estimation. With these
estimated parameters, it is possible to simulate graphs from the fitted
distribution and analyze the distribution of network statistics. We can then
characterize conditions under which the simulated networks based on ARD will
allow for consistent estimation of the unobserved network statistics, such as
eigenvector centrality or response functions by or of the unobserved network,

cusp-core problem of inner DM density profiles, and the too-big-to fail
problem, {\it i.e.} that the unobserved satellites are too big to not have
visible stars, but they can also account for the Standard Model (SM) neutrino
masses at one loop. We perform a comprehensive study of the right-handed
neutrino parameter space and impose the correct observed relic density and SM
neutrino mass differences and mixings. We find that the DM masses are in
agreement with bounds from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but that these constraints
induce sizeable DM couplings to the charged SM leptons. We then point out that
previously overlooked limits from current and future lepton flavour violation
experiments such as MEG and SINDRUM heavily constrain the allowed parameter
space. Since the DM is leptophilic, we also investigate electron recoil as a
possible direct detection signal, in particular in the XENON1T experiment. We
find that despite the large coupling and low backgrounds, the energy thresholds
are still too high and the predicted cross sections too low due to the heavy
charged mediator, whose mass is constrained by LEP limits.

decomposes its local tensors, and sends the updated intermediary results with

using epidemiological models developed to characterize the spread of biological
pathogens. However, most work examining the similarities between malware and
pathogens using such methods was based on theoretical analysis and simulation.
  Here we extend the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
epidemiological model to describe two of the most common infection methods used
by malware. We fit the proposed model to malware collected over a period of one
year from a major anti-malware vendor. We show that by fitting the proposed
model it is possible to identify the method of transmission used by the
malware, its rate of infection, and the number of machines which will be
infected unless blocked by anti-virus software. The Spearman correlation
between the number of actual and predicted infected machines is 0.84.
  Examining cases where an anti-malware ""signature"" was transmitted to
susceptible computers by the anti-virus provider, we show that the time to
remove the malware will be short and independent of the number of infected
computers if fewer than approximately 60% of susceptible computers have been
infected. If more computers were infected, the time to removal will be
approximately 3.2 greater, and will depend on the fraction of infected
computers.
  Our results show that the application of epidemiological models of infection
to malware can provide anti-virus providers with information on malware spread
and its potential damage. We further propose that similarities between computer
malware and biological pathogens, the availability of data on the former and
the dearth of data on the latter, make malware an extremely useful model for
testing interventions which could later be applied to improve medicine.

Consider $\Gamma$ is a graph with vertices $t_1$, ..., $t_s$, without
self-loops and multiple adjacencies. We can associate with such a graph an
ideal $I({\Gamma})$ of polynomial ring $$ A({\Gamma}) = k[t_1,...,t_s] $$ over
k, generated by $x_{ij}=t_it_j$, $i\ne j$, corresponding to edges of $\Gamma$.
The object of this paper is an algebra of Koszul homology $$
H((x_{ij}),A({\Gamma})) $$ of Koszul complex $K((x_{ij}),A({\Gamma})).$ The
result of this paper is finding a minimal multiplicative system of generators
of this algebra for some graphs $\Gamma$. There is an element $\bigstar$ in
homology algebra corresponding each vertex in the graph, that should be
included in every set of generators of each graph. This is a sufficient system
for trees. Also, there is a generator element $\bigcirc$ for every cycle with
length n if n mod 3=2. System of $\bigstar$-s and maybe $\bigcirc$ is
sufficient for a graph with only one cycle. Also, here described a set of
generators for a graph that is two cycles with exactly one common vertex. If a
graph is two graphs with known algebra generators, connected by an edge, the
answer for the whole graph is also described in this paper.

combination of transport and optical studies, we demonstrate that the quantum
corrections are present in strongly disordered conductor MoC up to at least
$\sim$4 eV, thereby extending the experimental window where such corrections
were found by a factor of 50. The knowledge of both, the real and imaginary

equations. However, under some circumstances, these biological systems may
experience instantaneous and periodic perturbations (e.g. harvest, birth,
release, fire events, etc) such that an appropriate formalism is necessary,
using, for instance, impulsive reaction-diffusion equations. While several
works tackled the issue of traveling waves for monotone reaction-diffusion
equations and the computation of spreading speeds, very little has been done in
the case of monotone impulsive reaction-diffusion equations. Based on
vector-valued recursion equations theory, we aim to present in this paper
results that address two main issues of monotone impulsive reaction-diffusion
equations. First, they deal with the existence of traveling waves for monotone
systems of impulsive reaction-diffusion equations. Second, they allow the
computation of spreading speeds for monotone systems of impulsive
reaction-diffusion equations. We apply our methodology to a planar system of
impulsive reaction-diffusion equations that models tree-grass interactions in
fire-prone savannas. Numerical simulations, including numerical approximations
of spreading speeds, are finally provided in order to illustrate our
theoretical results and support the discussion.

would provide information about the energy spectrum and propagation of Galactic
cosmic rays, and the detection of a point-like source of PeV gamma rays would
be strong evidence for a Galactic source capable of accelerating cosmic rays up
to at least a few PeV. This paper presents several un-binned maximum likelihood
searches for PeV gamma rays in the Southern Hemisphere using 5 years of data
from the IceTop air shower surface detector and the in-ice array of the IceCube
Observatory. The combination of both detectors takes advantage of the low muon
content and deep shower maximum of gamma-ray air showers, and provides
excellent sensitivity to gamma rays between $\sim$0.6 PeV and 100 PeV. Our
measurements of point-like and diffuse Galactic emission of PeV gamma rays are
consistent with background, so we constrain the angle-integrated diffuse
gamma-ray flux from the Galactic Plane at 2 PeV to $2.61 \times 10^{-19}$
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ TeV$^{-1}$ at 90% confidence, assuming an E$^{-3}$ spectrum,
and we estimate 90% upper limits on point-like emission at 2 PeV between
10$^{-21}$ - 10$^{-20}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ TeV$^{-1}$ for an E$^{-2}$ spectrum,
depending on declination. Furthermore, we exclude unbroken power-law emission
up to 2 PeV for several TeV gamma-ray sources observed by H.E.S.S., and
calculate upper limits on the energy cutoffs of these sources at 90%
confidence. We also find no PeV gamma rays correlated with neutrinos from
IceCube's high-energy starting event sample. These are currently the strongest
constraints on PeV gamma-ray emission.

covers media errors) with system-checksums and cross-device parity. This
system-level redundancy enables detection of and recovery from data corruption
due to device firmware bugs (e.g., reading data from the wrong physical
location). Direct access to NVM penalizes software-only implementations of
system-level redundancy, forcing a choice between lack of data protection or
significant performance penalties. Offloading the update and verification of
system-level redundancy to Tvarak, a hardware controller co-located with the
last-level cache, enables efficient protection of data from such bugs in memory
controller and NVM DIMM firmware. Simulation-based evaluation with seven

Finder, we found that the nearby star HR 5183 (HD 120066) hosts a 3$M_J$
minimum mass planet with an orbital period of $74^{+43}_{-22}$ years. The orbit
is highly eccentric (e$\simeq$0.84), shuttling the planet from within the orbit
of Jupiter to beyond the orbit of Neptune. Our careful survey design enabled
high cadence observations before, during, and after the planet's periastron
passage, yielding precise orbital parameter constraints. We searched for
stellar or planetary companions that could have excited the planet's
eccentricity, but found no candidates, potentially implying that the perturber
was ejected from the system. We did identify a bound stellar companion more
than 15,000 au from the primary, but reasoned that it is currently too widely
separated to have an appreciable effect on HR 5183 b. Because HR 5183 b's wide
orbit takes it more than 30 au (1"") from its star, we also explored the
potential of complimentary studies with direct imaging or stellar astrometry.
We found that a Gaia detection is very likely, and that imaging at 10 $\mu$m is
a promising avenue. This discovery highlights the value of long-baseline RV
surveys for discovering and characterizing long-period, eccentric Jovian
planets. This population may offer important insights into the dynamical
evolution of planetary systems containing multiple massive planets.

two-body Open Quantum System (OQS). The OQS is described by a system of two
entangled atoms, surrounded by a thermal bath, which is modelled by a massless
probe scalar field. Firstly, we partially trace over the bath field and
construct the Gorini Kossakowski Sudarshan Lindblad (GSKL) master equation,

This GSKL master equation is characterized by two components, these are-Spin
chain interaction Hamiltonian and the Lindbladian. To fix the form of both of
them, we compute the Wightman functions for probe massless scalar field. Using
this result along with the large time equilibrium behaviour we obtain the

evaluate various entanglement measures, namely Von-Neumann entropy, R$e'$nyi
entropy, logarithmic negativity, entanglement of formation, concurrence and
quantum discord for the two atomic subsystems on the static patch of De-Sitter

real-world problem is far more challenging because: i) new classes unseen in

to evolve when new classes emerge in real time; and iii) instances in new
classes may not follow the ""independent and identically distributed"" (iid)
assumption. Most existing work only aims to detect the unknown classes and is
incapable of continuing to learn newer classes. Although a few methods consider
both detecting and including new classes, all are based on the predefined
handcrafted features that cannot evolve and are out-of-date for characterizing
emerging classes. Thus, to address the above challenges, we propose a novel
generic end-to-end framework consisting of a dynamic cascade of classifiers
that incrementally learn their dynamic and inherent features. The proposed
method injects dynamic elements into the system by detecting instances from
unknown classes, while at the same time incrementally updating the model to
include the new classes. The resulting cascade tree grows by adding a new leaf
node classifier once a new class is detected, and the discriminative features
are updated via an end-to-end learning strategy. Experiments on two real-world

state-of-the-art methods.

entertainment, filming, or transporting items from one place to another.
However, personal drones lack a privacy-preserving mechanism. While in mission,
drones often trespass into the personal territories of other people and capture
photos or videos through windows without their knowledge and consent. They may
also capture video or pictures of people walking, sitting, or doing private
things within the drones' reach in clear form without their go permission. This
could potentially invade people's personal privacy. This paper, therefore,
proposes a lightweight privacy-preserving-by-design method that prevents drones
from peeking through windows of houses and capturing people doing private
things at home. It is a fast window object detection and scrambling technology
built based on image-enhancing, morphological transformation, segmentation and
contouring processes (MASP). Besides, a chaotic scrambling technique is
incorporated into it for privacy purpose. Hence, this mechanism detects window
objects in every image or frame of a real-time video and masks them chaotically

approach for data collection has been to automatically generate pseudo-language

collection procedure often leads to low performance on real data, due to a
mismatch between the true distribution of examples and the distribution induced

and the mismatch in language distribution between the true and induced
distributions. We quantify the effects of these mismatches, and propose a new
data collection approach that mitigates them. Assuming access to unlabeled

enable efficient stochastic optimization of a family of non-decomposable DC

establish a formalized framework from which we can better understand the
computational bounds of NAS in relation to its search space. For this, we first
reformulate the function approximation problem in terms of sequences of
functions, and we call it the Function Approximation (FA) problem; then we show
that it is computationally infeasible to devise a procedure that solves FA for
all functions to zero error, regardless of the search space. We show also that
such error will be minimal if a specific class of functions is present in the
search space. Subsequently, we show that machine learning as a mathematical
problem is a solution strategy for FA, albeit not an effective one, and further
describe a stronger version of this approach: the Approximate Architectural
Search Problem (a-ASP), which is the mathematical equivalent of NAS. We
leverage the framework from this paper and results from the literature to
describe the conditions under which a-ASP can potentially solve FA as well as
an exhaustive search, but in polynomial time.

occurs naturally when the underlying random field is periodic. We show that a
solution to the discrete problem exists, is unique and depends smoothly on the

Astronomy. Their transient and extreme nature implies that monitoring the VHE
sky is fundamental to investigate the non-electromagnetic signals. However, the
limited effective area of space-borne instruments prevents observations above a
few hundred GeV, while the small field of view and low duty cycle of IACTs make
them unsuited for extensive monitoring activities and prompt response to
transients. Extensive Air Shower arrays (EAS) can provide a large field of
view, a wide effective area and a very high duty cycle. Their main difficulty
is the distinction between gamma-ray and cosmic-ray initiated air showers,
especially below the TeV range. Here we present some case studies stressing the
importance that a new EAS array in the Southern Hemisphere will be able to
survey the sky from below 100 GeV up to several TeV. In the energy domain
between 100 and 400 GeV we expect the strongest electromagnetic signatures of
the acceleration of ultra-relativistic particles in sources like SNRs, blazar
jets and gamma-ray bursts, as recently proved by IACT observations. This
spectral window is also crucial to understand the Universe opacity to high
energy radiation, thus providing constraints on the cosmological parameters. We

K-Means variations and initialisation techniques have been proposed with
different degrees of complexity. In this study we focus on common K-Means

deterministic methods perform better than stochastic methods. However, there is
a trade-off: less sophisticated stochastic methods, executed multiple times,
can result in better clustering. Factoring in execution time, deterministic

conclusions are obtained through extensive benchmarking using a range of
synthetic model generators and real-world data sets.

step involves propagating an enclosure of the system states through the
nonlinear dynamics (prediction), and then enclosing the intersection of this
set with a bounded-error measurement (update). When these enclosures are
represented by simple sets such as intervals, ellipsoids, parallelotopes, and
zonotopes, certain set operations can be very conservative. Yet, using general
convex polytopes is much more computationally demanding. To address this, this
paper presents two new methods, a mean value extension and a first-order Taylor
extension, for efficiently propagating constrained zonotopes through nonlinear
mappings. These extend existing methods for zonotopes in a consistent way.
Examples show that these extensions yield tighter prediction enclosures than
zonotopic estimation methods, while largely retaining the computational
benefits of zonotopes. Moreover, they enable tighter update enclosures because
constrained zonotopes can represent intersections much more accurately than
zonotopes.

where two parallel traffic flows interact with each other both in the physical
sense (how and where cars flow between the two lane groups) and the
physiological sense (how driving behaviors are changed by being adjacent to a
quantitatively and qualitatively different traffic flow).
  The local descriptions we developed in Part I are not the only modeling
complexity introduced in managed lane-freeway networks. The complex topologies
mean that network-scale modeling of a freeway corridor is increased in
complexity as well. The already-difficult model calibration problem for a
dynamic model of a freeway becomes more complex when the freeway becomes, in
effect, two interrelating flow streams. In the present paper, we present an
iterative-learning-based approach to calibrating our model's physical and
driver-behavioral parameters. We consider the common situation where a complex
traffic model needs to be calibrated to recreate real-world baseline traffic
behavior, such that counterfactuals can be generated by training purposes. Our
method is used to identify traditional freeway parameters as well as the
proposed parameters that describe managed lane-freeway-network-specific
behaviors. We validate our model and calibration methodology with case studies

two classes of Nanoparticle (NP) solids: (1) a bilayer NP solid (BNS) with an
energy offset, and (2) a BNS as part of a Field-Effect Transistor (FET). HiNTS
integrates the ab initio characterization of single NPs with the
phonon-assisted tunneling transition model of the NP-NP transitions into a
Kinetic Monte Carlo based simulation of the charge transport in NP solids.
First, we studied a BNS with an inter-layer energy offset $\Delta$, possibly
caused by a fixed electric field. Our results include the following. (1) In the
independent energy-offset model, we observed the emergence of commensuration
effects when scanning the electron filling factor $FF$ across integer values.
These commensuration effects were profound as they reduced the mobility by
several orders of magnitude. We analyzed these commensuration effects in a five
dimensional parameter space, as a function of the on-site charging energy
$E_C$, energy offset $\Delta$, the disorder $D$, the electron filling factor
$FF$, and the temperature $k_{B}T$. We demonstrated the complexity of our model
by showing that at integer filling factors $FF$ commensuration effects are
present in some regions of the parameter space, while they vanish in other
regions, thus defining distinct dynamical phases of the model. We determined
the phase boundaries between these dynamical phases. (2) Using these results as
a foundation, we shifted our focus to the experimentally much-studied NP-FETs.
NP-FETs are also characterized by an inter-layer energy offset $\Delta$, which,
in contrast to our first model, is set by the gate voltage $V_G$ and thereby
related to the electron filling $FF$. We demonstrated the emergence of
commensuration effects and distinct dynamical phases in these NP-FETs.

defining precise semantics of disentangled representations, and (b)
establishing robust metrics for evaluation. First, we characterize the concept
""disentangled representations"" used in supervised and unsupervised methods
along three dimensions-informativeness, separability and interpretability -
which can be expressed and quantified explicitly using information-theoretic
constructs. This helps explain the behaviors of several well-known
disentanglement learning models. We then propose robust metrics for measuring
informativeness, separability and interpretability. Through a comprehensive
suite of experiments, we show that our metrics correctly characterize the
representations learned by different methods and are consistent with
qualitative (visual) results. Thus, the metrics allow disentanglement learning
methods to be compared on a fair ground. We also empirically uncovered new
interesting properties of VAE-based methods and interpreted them with our
formulation. These findings are promising and hopefully will encourage the
design of more theoretically driven models for learning disentangled
representations.

syntactic latent to represent syntactic structures of sentences. SAVAEs are

(specifically maternal internalizing symptoms). Seven meta-analyses (combined

multi-level meta-analysis (N=1324) assessed aggregated correlations with
sensitivity. Significant mean effects emerged in expected directions, whereby
all stress indicators were negatively associated with sensitivity. Small
effects were found for associations with parenting stress (r=-0.13) and mental

provide useful gradients, and therefore requires complex optimization
techniques. The L1 regularizer is almost everywhere differentiable and can be
easily optimized with gradient descent. Yet it is not scale-invariant, causing
the same shrinking rate to all parameters, which is inefficient in increasing
sparsity. Inspired by the Hoyer measure (the ratio between L1 and L2 norms)
used in traditional compressed sensing problems, we present DeepHoyer, a set of
sparsity-inducing regularizers that are both differentiable almost everywhere
and scale-invariant. Our experiments show that enforcing DeepHoyer regularizers
can produce even sparser neural network models than previous works, under the
same accuracy level. We also show that DeepHoyer can be applied to both
element-wise and structural pruning.

temperature (300 K $\sim$ 5 K) and spectral (500 nm and 850 nm) ranges.
Numerous sharp transitions corresponding to the Er$^{3+}$ ionic levels were
observed, which show Stark shifts induced by the crystal field. With decreasing
temperature from 300 K to 5 K, all transition peaks exhibit spectral red-shift.
We believe that such red-shift behavior is due to the change of the crystal
field together with the change of strain field induced by the film and the
substrate in varying temperature. An interesting result is the total amount of
red-shifts between 300 K and 5 K. We obtain that the higher transition energy
peaks show bigger red-shifts. This is very consistent to all transition peaks.
This is because the dipole moments between the transition levels are different
that lead to different amounts of Stark shifts.

capable of event-driven readouts, it can achieve high timing resolution greater
than $\sim 10{\rm ~\mu s}$, which enables low background observation by
adopting the anti-coincidence technique. One of the major issues in the
development of XRPIX is the electrical interference between the sensor layer

insulator layer of the SOI structure. In this structure, the middle Si layer
works as an electrical shield to decouple the sensor layer and circuit layer.

irradiated the X-ray beam collimated with $4{\rm ~\mu m\phi}$ pinhole, and

annotate, categorize, and describe their posts. The hashtags, that a user
provides to a post (e.g., a micro-video), are the ones which in her mind can
well describe the post content where she is interested in. It means that we
should consider both users' preferences on the post contents and their personal
understanding on the hashtags. Most existing methods rely on modeling either
the interactions between hashtags and posts or the interactions between users
and hashtags for hashtag recommendation. These methods have not well explored
the complicated interactions among users, hashtags, and micro-videos. In this
paper, towards the personalized micro-video hashtag recommendation, we propose
a Graph Convolution Network based Personalized Hashtag Recommendation (GCN-PHR)
model, which leverages recently advanced GCN techniques to model the complicate
interactions among <users, hashtags, micro-videos> and learn their
representations. In our model, the users, hashtags, and micro-videos are three
types of nodes in a graph and they are linked based on their direct
associations. In particular, the message-passing strategy is used to learn the
representation of a node (e.g., user) by aggregating the message passed from
the directly linked other types of nodes (e.g., hashtag and micro-video).
Because a user is often only interested in certain parts of a micro-video and a
hashtag is typically used to describe the part (of a micro-video) that the user
is interested in, we leverage the attention mechanism to filter the message
passed from micro-videos to users and hashtags, which can significantly improve
the representation capability. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two
real-world micro-video datasets and demonstrate that our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.

this paper, we propose an efficient temporal reasoning graph (TRG) to
simultaneously capture the appearance features and temporal relation between

temporal relation graphs to explore temporal relation on the multi-scale range.
Additionally, to facilitate multi-scale temporal relation extraction, we design
a multi-head temporal adjacent matrix to represent multi-kinds of temporal

extract the semantic meaning of those features convolving through the graphs.
Extensive experiments are performed on widely-used large-scale datasets, such

also proposed for A2J. Meanwhile 2D CNN (i.e., ResNet-50) is used as backbone
network to drive A2J, without using time-consuming 3D convolutional or

considered, over which a source wishes to send a specified number of bits to a
destination node. Each node of the DAG is powered by a separate renewable
energy source, and the harvested energy is used to facilitate the source
destination data flow. The challenge here is to find the optimal rate and power
allocations across time for each node on its outgoing edges so as to minimize
the time by which the destination receives a specified number of bits. An
online setting is considered where an algorithm only has causal information
about the energy arrivals. Using the competitive ratio as the performance
metric, i.e. the ratio of the cost of the online algorithm and the optimal
offline algorithm, maximized over all inputs, a {\it lazy} online algorithm
with a competitive ratio of $2+\delta$ for any $\delta>0$ is proposed.
Incidentally, $2$ is also a lower bound to the competitive ratio of any online
algorithm for this problem. Our lazy online algorithm is described and analyzed
via defining a novel max-flow problem over a DAG, where the rate on the subset
of outgoing edges of any node are related/constrained. An optimal algorithm to
find max-flow with these constraints is also provided, which may be of
independent interest.

that can support more users by exploiting the notion of power-domain NOMA. In
hybrid uplink NOMA, we do not consider centralized power control as a base
station (BS) needs instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of all users
which leads to a high signaling overhead. Rather, each user is allowed to
perform power control under fading in accordance with a truncated channel
inversion power control policy. Due to the lack of coordination of centralized
power control, users in the same resource block compete for access. To analyze
users' behavior, evolutionary game can be considered so that each user can
choose transmission strategies to maximize payoff in hybrid uplink NOMA with
power control. Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is characterized with fixed
costs as well as costs that depend on channel realizations, and it is also
shown that hybrid uplink NOMA can provide a higher throughput than orthogonal
multiple access (OMA). To update the state in evolutionary game for hybrid
uplink NOMA, the replicator dynamic equation is considered with two possible
implementation methods.

hole candidate MAXI J1828-249, performed with Suzaku and the Kanata telescope
around the X-ray flux peak in the 2013 outburst. The time-averaged X-ray
spectrum covering 0.6--168 keV was approximately characterized by a strong
multi-color disk blackbody component with an inner disk temperature of ~0.6
keV, and a power-law tail with a photon index of ~2.0. We detected an
additional structure at 5-10 keV, which can be modelled neither with X-ray
reflection on the disk, nor relativistic broadening of the disk emission.
Instead, it was successfully reproduced with a Comptonization of disk photons
by thermal electrons with a relatively low temperature (<~10 keV). We infer
that the source was in the intermediate state, considering its long-term trend
in the hardness intensity diagram, the strength of the spectral power-law tail,
and its variability properties. The low-temperature Comptonization component
could be produced in a boundary region between the truncated standard disk and
the hot inner flow, or a Comptonizing region that somehow developed above the
disk surface. The multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution suggests that
the optical and UV fluxes were dominated by irradiated outer disk emission.

beam, has contributed significantly to molecular structure assessments in
stereochemistry, biomolecular science and crystallography. Thus far, it is
commonly believed that optical activity is manifested only in the chiral media
which can give rise to circular birefringence of light. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate that free space can also support the implementation of
non-reciprocal optical activity with Bessel beams by spin-orbital interaction.
Specifically, non-diffractive optically active beams are realized, with their
optical rotatory power readily controlled by simple optical elements. We show
that such free-space optical activity can be exploited to form non-reciprocal
optical components such as polarization rotators, isolators, and circulators.
Our results may bring about new possibilities of media-independent optical

plays a crucial role in our daily lives. Existing vision-based or sensor-based
solutions are either obstructive to use or rely on specialized hardware,
hindering their applicability. This paper introduces EmoSense, a
first-of-its-kind wireless emotion sensing system driven by computational
intelligence. The basic methodology is to explore the physical expression of
emotions from wireless channel response via data mining. The design and
implementation of EmoSense {face} two major challenges: extracting physical
expression from wireless channel data and recovering emotion from the
corresponding physical expression. For the former, we present a Fresnel zone
based theoretical model depicting the fingerprint of the physical expression on
channel response. For the latter, we design an efficient computational
intelligence driven mechanism to recognize emotion from the corresponding
fingerprints. We prototyped EmoSense on the commodity WiFi infrastructure and
compared it with main-stream sensor-based and vision-based approaches in the
real-world scenario. The numerical study over $3360$ cases confirms that
EmoSense achieves a comparable performance to the vision-based and sensor-based
rivals under different scenarios. EmoSense only leverages the low-cost and
prevalent WiFi infrastructures and thus constitutes a tempting solution for
emotion sensing.

distributed file system is used where the the storage resource are pooled
together from more than one node and presents a unified view of it to outside
world. Optimum performance of these distributed file-systems given a workload
is of paramount important as disk being the slowest component in the framework.
Owning to this fact, many big data processing frameworks implement their own
file-system to get the optimal performance by fine tuning it for their specific
workloads. However, fine-tuning a file system for a particular workload results
in poor performance for workloads that do not match the profile of desired
workload. Hence, these file systems cannot be used for general purpose usage,
where the workload characteristics shows high variation. In this paper we model
the performance of a general purpose file-system and analyse the impact of
tuning the file-system on its performance. Performance of these parallel
file-systems are not easy to model because the performance depends on a lot of
configuration parameters, like the network, disk, under lying file system,
number of servers, number of clients, parallel file-system configuration etc.
We present a Multiple Linear regression model that can capture the relationship
between the configuration parameters of a file system, hardware configuration,
workload configuration (collectively called features) and the performance
metrics. We use this to rank the features according to their importance in
deciding the performance of the file-system.

condition for one-sample tests to achieve the optimal error exponent in the
universal setting, i.e., for any distribution defining the alternative

the quadratic-time Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD) based tests achieve this

fully inelastic acoustic phonon scatterings in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac
materials for large range of temperature ($T$) and chemical potential ($\mu$).
Rigorous analytical solutions and symmetry properties of Fermionic and Bosonic
functions are obtained. We illustrate how doping alters the temperature
dependence of acoustic phonon scattering rates. It is shown that the
quasi-elastic and ansatz equations previously derived for acoustic phonon
scatterings in graphene are limiting cases of the inelastic-scattering
equations derived here. For heavily-doped graphene, we found that the high-$T$
behavior of resistivity is better described by $\rho(T, \mu) \propto T(1 -
\zeta_a\mu^2/3(k_BT)^2)$ rather than a linear $T$ behavior, and in the low $T$
regime we found $\tau^{-1} \propto (k_BT)^4$ but with a different prefactor
(i.e. $\sim$ 3 times smaller) in comparison with the existing quasi-elastic
expressions. Furthermore, we found a simple analytic ""semi-inelastic""
expression of the form $\tau^{-1} \propto (k_BT)^4/(1+ c T^3)$ which matches
nearly perfectly with the full inelastic results for any temperature up to 500
K and $\mu$ up to 1 eV. Our simple analytic results agree well with previous
first-principles studies and available experimental data. Moreover, we obtain
an analytical form for the acoustic gauge field $\beta_A =
3\beta\gamma_0/4\sqrt{2}$. Our analyses pave a way for investigating
scatterings between electrons and other fundamental excitations with linear
dispersion relation in 2D Dirac material-based heterostructures such as
bogolon-mediated electron scattering in graphene-based hybrid Bose-Fermi
systems.

traditional approaches that defines a fixed set of security compartments,
dependent security labels allow for a dynamic lattice that can be extended at

compliance at runtime. This paper contributes a practical solution for powerful
and flexible runtime verification of distributed, object-oriented applications,
via a combination of the runtime verification tool Larva and the active object
framework ProActive. Even if Larva supports in itself only the generation of
local, sequential monitors, we empower Larva for distributed monitoring by
connecting monitors with active objects, turning them into active,
communicating monitors. We discuss how this allows for a variety of monitoring
architectures. Further, we show how property specifications, and thereby the
generated monitors, provide a model that splits the blame between the local
object and its environment. While Larva itself focuses on monitoring of
control-oriented properties, we use the Larva front-end StaRVOOrS to also
capture data-oriented (pre/post) properties in the distributed monitoring. We
demonstrate this approach to distributed runtime verification with a case
study, a distributed key/value store.

transport, as well as the formation of different kinds of magnetic barrier in
geometrically thick, optically thin, vertically averaged 1.5-dimensional
advective accretion flows around black holes. The externally generated magnetic
fields are captured by the accretion process from the environment, say,
companion stars or interstellar medium. This field becomes dynamically dominant
near the event horizon of a black hole due to continuous advection of the
magnetic flux. In such magnetically dominated accretion flows, the accreting
matter either decelerates or faces magnetic barrier in vicinity of the black
hole depending on the magnetic field geometry. We find that the accumulated
strong poloidal fields along with certain toroidal field geometry help in the
formation of magnetic barrier which may knock the matter to infinity. When
matter is trying to go back to infinity after getting knocked out by the
barrier, in some cases it is prevented being escaped due to cumulative action
of strong magnetic tension and gravity, and hence another magnetic barrier. We
suggest, this kind of flow may be responsible for the formation of episodic
jets in which magnetic field can lock the matter in between these two barriers.
We also find that for the toroidally dominated disc, the accreting matter
rotates very fast and decelerates towards the central black hole.

show that strong magnetic field dramatically decreases luminosity of highly

According to a comparison between the feature shapes averaged over all
directions and the absorption coefficients of candidate minerals, the IPD was
found to typically include small silicate crystals, especially enstatite
grains. We also found the variations in the feature shapes and the related
grain properties among the different sky directions. From investigations of the
correlation between feature shapes and the brightness contributions from dust
bands, the IPD in dust bands seems to have the size frequency distribution
biased toward large grains and show the indication of hydrated minerals. The
spectra at higher ecliptic latitude showed a stronger excess, which indicates
an increase in the fraction of small grains included in the line of sight at
higher ecliptic latitudes. If we focus on the dependence of detailed feature
shapes on ecliptic latitudes, the IPD at higher latitudes was found to have a
lower olivine/pyroxene ratio for small amorphous grains. The variation of the

in other layers. Accordingly, a similarity-based automatic general-purpose

leads to a loss in overall performance. In this work, we propose a novel
unequal sub-connected architecture for hybrid combining at the receiver of a
massive MIMO system that employs unequal numbers of antennas in sub-antenna
arrays. The optimal design of the proposed architecture is analytically
derived, and includes antenna allocation and channel ordering schemes.
Simulation results show that an enhancement of up to 10% can be attained in the
total achievable rate by unequally assigning antennas to sub-arrays in the
sub-connected system at the cost of a marginal increase in power consumption.
Furthermore, in order to reduce the computational complexity involved in
finding the optimal number of antennas connected to each radio frequency (RF)
chain, we propose three low-complexity antenna allocation algorithms. The
simulation results show that they can yield a significant reduction in
complexity while achieving near-optimal performance.

networks via random linear interpolations between pairs of samples and their
labels. It plays an important role in model regularization, semi-supervised
learning and domain adaption. However, despite its empirical success, its
deficiency of randomly mixing samples has poorly been studied. Since deep
networks are capable of memorizing the entire dataset, the corrupted samples
generated by vanilla MixUp with a badly chosen interpolation policy will
degrade the performance of networks. To overcome the underfitting by corrupted
samples, inspired by Meta-learning (learning to learn), we propose a novel
technique of learning to mixup in this work, namely, MetaMixUp. Unlike the
vanilla MixUp that samples interpolation policy from a predefined distribution,
this paper introduces a meta-learning based online optimization approach to
dynamically learn the interpolation policy in a data-adaptive way. The
validation set performance via meta-learning captures the underfitting issue,
which provides more information to refine interpolation policy. Furthermore, we
adapt our method for pseudo-label based semisupervised learning (SSL) along
with a refined pseudo-labeling strategy. In our experiments, our method
achieves better performance than vanilla MixUp and its variants under
supervised learning configuration. In particular, extensive experiments show
that our MetaMixUp adapted SSL greatly outperforms MixUp and many
state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10 and SVHN benchmarks under SSL
configuration.

representation to predict the global syntactic structure, which is thereafter
leveraged to guide the video captioning generation and control the syntax of

dynamically and adaptively incorporate the global syntactic POS information
into the decoder for generating each word. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets, namely MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate that the proposed
model can well exploit complementary information from multiple representations,
resulting in improved performances. Moreover, the generated global POS

superstructures, in the fluctuation fields of temperature $\theta$ and vertical
velocity $w$ in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection at large aspect
ratios. Earlier studies suggested that velocity superstructures were smaller
than their thermal counterparts in the center of the domain. However, a
scale-by-scale analysis of the correlation between the two fields employing the
linear coherence spectrum reveals that superstructures of the same size exist
in both fields, which are almost perfectly correlated. The issue is further
clarified by the observation that in contrast to the temperature, and unlike
assumed previously, superstructures in the vertical velocity field do not
result in a peak in the power spectrum of $w$. The origin of this difference is
traced back to the production terms of the $\theta$- and $w$-variance. These
results are confirmed for a range of Rayleigh numbers $Ra = 10^5$--$10^9$, the
superstructure size is seen to increase monotonically with $Ra$. Furthermore,
the scale distribution of particularly the temperature fluctuations is
pronouncedly bimodal. In addition to the large-scale peak caused by the
superstructures, there exists a strong small-scale peak. This `inner peak' is
most intense at a distance of $\delta_\theta$ from the wall and associated with
structures of size $\approx 10 \delta_\theta$, where $\delta_\theta$ is the
thermal boundary layer thickness. Finally, based on the vertical coherence
relative to a reference height of $\delta_\theta$, a self-similar structure is
identified in the velocity field (vertical and horizontal components) but not
in the temperature.

challenging problem owing to the rapid growth of 360-degree contents. Different
from traditional 2D image quality assessment (IQA), more complex aspects are
involved in 3D omnidirectional IQA, especially unlimited field of view (FoV)
and extra depth perception, which brings difficulty to evaluate the quality of
experience (QoE) of 3D omnidirectional images. In this paper, we propose a
multi-viewport based fullreference stereo 360 IQA model. Due to the freely
changeable viewports when browsing in the head-mounted display (HMD), our
proposed approach processes the image inside FoV rather than the projected one
such as equirectangular projection (ERP). In addition, since overall QoE
depends on both image quality and depth perception, we utilize the features
estimated by the difference map between left and right views which can reflect
disparity. The depth perception features along with binocular image qualities
are employed to further predict the overall QoE of 3D 360 images. The
experimental results on our public Stereoscopic OmnidirectionaL Image quality
assessment Database (SOLID) show that the proposed method achieves a
significant improvement over some well-known IQA metrics and can accurately
reflect the overall QoE of perceived images.

its guidance to Light Field (LF) contents acquisition, processing and

on both angular consistency and spatial quality. However, few existing LF-IQA
methods concentrate on effects caused by angular inconsistency. Especially,
no-reference methods lack effective utilization of 2-D angular information. In
this paper, we focus on measuring the 2-D angular consistency for LF-IQA. The

simultaneously record the angular information in both horizontal and vertical

Specifically, we first utilize Global Entropy Distribution (GED) and Uniform

then pool them together to measure angular consistency. In addition, the

consideration of efficiency and consistency of data length, the recordings are
padded or truncated into a medium length, where the padding/truncating time
windows are selected randomly to sup-press overfitting. Then, the ECGs are used
to train deep neural network (DNN) models with a novel structure that combines
a deep residual network with an attention mechanism. Finally, an ensemble model

of 1ES 2344+51.4 in the very-high-energy (VHE, $>$100 GeV) gamma-ray range, its

showing around 60 % of the flux of the Crab Nebula above 350 GeV. In 1996,
during another flare in the X-ray band, observations with Beppo-SAX revealed a
large 0.1-10 keV flux variability on timescales of a few hours and an
impressive frequency shift of the synchrotron peak to above $10^{18}$ Hz. Later
on, this extreme behaviour of the source motivated several multiwavelength
campaigns, during most of which the source appeared to be in a low state and

2344+51.4 in a high state and triggered multiwavelength observations. The VHE

as nodes, and design relational graph embedding by modeling pairwise and
neighboring relations among views. By gradually coarsening the graph, we build
a hierarchical relational graph embedding network (HRGE-Net) to aggregate the
multi-view features to be a global shape descriptor. Extensive experiments show
that HRGE-Net achieves stateof-the-art performance for 3D shape classification
and retrieval on benchmark datasets.

constrained minimization problems, that is, a target function and a set of
constraints. However, it is based on an antipodal way of thinking to what leads
to constrained minimization methods. Instead of adapting unconstrained
minimization algorithms to handling constraints, it adapts feasibility-seeking
algorithms to reduce (not necessarily minimize) target function values. This is
done by inserting target-function-reducing perturbations into a
feasibility-seeking algorithm while retaining its feasibility-seeking ability
and without paying a high computational price. A superiorized algorithm that
employs component-wise target function reduction steps is presented. This
enables derivative-free superiorization (DFS), meaning that superiorization can
be applied to target functions that have no calculable partial derivatives or
subgradients. The numerical behavior of our derivative-free superiorization
algorithm is illustrated on a data set generated by simulating a problem of
image reconstruction from projections. We present a tool (we call it a
proximity-target curve) for deciding which of two iterative methods is ""better""
for solving a particular problem. The plots of proximity-target curves of our
experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed derivative-free

cancellation of excitation and inhibition is comparable in size to the factors
that cancel, rather than tight, meaning that the net input is very small

paper presents the performance of both homogenous and heterogenous model

of artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR). For
each of the homogenous and heterogenous model ensembles, the study investigates
the performance of three model ensembling approaches: linear averaging
(non-weighted), ranked weighted averaging and model stacking using artificial
neural networks. Using the approach of 'over-produce then select', the study
used 17 years of data on 16 selected variables for predictive drought
monitoring to build 244 individual ANN and SVR models from which 111 models
were selected for the building of the model ensembles. The results indicate
marginal superiority of heterogenous to homogenous model ensembles. Model
stacking is shown to realize models that are superior in performance in the
prediction of future vegetation conditions as compared to the linear averaging
and weighted averaging approaches. The best performance from the heterogenous
stacked model ensembles recorded an R2 of 0.94 in the prediction of future
vegetation conditions as compared to an R2 of 0.83 and R2 of 0.78 for both ANN
and SVR respectively in the traditional champion model approaches to the
realization of predictive models. We conclude that despite the computational
resource intensiveness of the model ensembling approach to drought prediction,
the returns in terms of model performance is worth the investment, especially
in the context of the recent exponential increase in computational power.

presence of a non-zero vorticity field. Moreover, we show that larger initial

galaxies using statistically large samples of galaxies, totalling over
200\,000, over a large redshift range, 0.0 to 4.0. We train and use
convolutional neural networks to create binary merger identifications (merger
or non-merger) in the SDSS, KiDS and CANDELS imaging surveys. We then compare
the galaxy main sequence subtracted SFR of the merging and non-merging galaxies
to determine what effect, if any, a galaxy merger has on SFR. We find that the
SFR of merging galaxies are not significantly different from the SFR of
non-merging systems. The changes in the average SFR seen in the star forming
population when a galaxy is merging are small, of the order of a factor of 1.2.
However, the higher the SFR above the galaxy main sequence, the higher the
fraction of galaxy mergers. Galaxy mergers have little effect on the SFR of the
majority of merging galaxies compared to the non-merging galaxies. The typical
change in SFR is less than 0.1~dex in either direction. Larger changes in SFR
can be seen but are less common. The increase in merger fraction as the
distance above the galaxy main sequence increases demonstrates that galaxy
mergers can induce starbursts.

Usually, the output of the last layer of the N-layer encoder is fed to the
M-layer decoder, and the output of the last decoder layer is used to compute
softmax loss. Instead, our method computes a single loss consisting of NxM
losses: the softmax loss for the output of each of the M decoder layers derived
using the output of each of the N encoder layers. A single model trained by our
method can be used for decoding with an arbitrary fewer number of encoder and
decoder layers. In practical scenarios, this (a) enables faster decoding with
insignificant losses in translation quality and (b) alleviates the need to
train NxM models, thereby saving space. We take a case study of neural machine
translation and show the advantage and give a cost-benefit analysis of our
approach.

transport sector is to use alternatively fueled vehicles (AFV). Heavy-duty
vehicles (HDV) emit a large share of GHG emissions in the transport sector and
are therefore the subject of growing attention from global regulators. Fuel
cell and green hydrogen technologies are a promising option to decarbonize
HDVs, as their fast refueling and long vehicle ranges are in line with current
logistic operation concepts. Moreover, the application of green hydrogen in
transport could enable more effective integration of renewable energies (RE)
across different energy sectors. This paper explores the interplay between HDV
Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS) that produce hydrogen locally and the power
system by combining an infrastructure location planning model and an energy
system optimization model that takes grid expansion options into account. Two
scenarios - one sizing refueling stations in symbiosis with the power system
and one sizing them independently of it - are assessed regarding their impacts
on the total annual energy system costs, regional RE integration and the
levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The impacts are calculated based on
locational marginal pricing for 2050. Depending on the integration scenario, we
find average LCOH of between 5.66 euro/kg and 6.20 euro/kg, for which nodal
electricity prices are the main determining factor as well as a strong
difference in LCOH between north and south Germany. From a system perspective,
investing in HDV-HRS in symbiosis with the power system rather than
independently promises cost savings of around one billion-euros per annum. We
therefore conclude that the co-optimization of multiple energy sectors is
important for investment planning and has the potential to exploit synergies.

incrementally, and an MFS solves the multi-objective trade-offs like the
simultaneous maximization of both interpretability and accuracy. This paper

exploration approaches which will identify and prioritise areas that are more
relevant for the responder and, thus, for the task, leading to the development
of safer, more robust and efficient joint exploration strategies. More
specifically, this paper presents an active intention recognition paradigm to
perceive, even under sensory constraints, not only the target's position but
also the first responder's movements, which can provide information on his/her
intentions (e.g. reaching the position where he/she expects the target to be).
This mechanism is implemented by employing an extension of Monte-Carlo-based
planning techniques for partially observable environments, where the reward
function is augmented with an entropy reduction bonus. We test in simulation
several configurations of reward augmentation, both information theoretic and
not, as well as belief state approximations and obtain substantial improvements

larger outdegree also affects the location of the birds with the most

realistic molecular systems this approximation no longer suffices. We elucidate
non-standard harmonic, and anharmonic effects, on linear absorption and
dynamics using a stochastic Schr\""{o}dinger equation approach to account for
the environment. Firstly, a harmonic oscillator model with ground and excited
potentials that differ in curvature is utilised. Using this model, it is shown
that curvature difference gives rise to an additional sub-structure in the
vibronic progression of absorption spectra. This effect is explained, and
subsequently quantified, via a derived expression for the Franck-Condon
coefficients. Subsequently, anharmonic features in dissipative systems are
studied, using a Morse potential, and parameters that correspond to the
diatomic molecule $H_{2}$ for differing displacements and environment
interaction. Lastly using a model potential, the population dynamics and
absorption spectra for the stiff-stilbene photoswitch is presented and features
are explained by a combination of curvature difference and anharmonicity in the
form of potential energy barriers on the excited potential.

launched. At the scales of several times the binary system size, the jets are
expected to follow a helical path caused by the interaction with a strong
stellar wind and orbital motion. Such a trajectory has its influence on the
non-thermal emission of the jets, which also depends strongly on the observing
angle due to Doppler boosting effects. We explore how the expected non-thermal
emission of HMMQ jets at small scales is affected by the impact of the stellar
wind and the orbital motion on the jet propagation. We studied the broadband
non-thermal emission, from radio to gamma rays, produced in HMMQ jets up to a
distance of several orbital separations, taking into account a realistic jet
trajectory, different model parameters, and orbital modulation. The jet
trajectory is computed by considering momentum transfer with the stellar wind.
Electrons are injected at the position where a recollimation shock in the jets
is expected due to the wind impact. Their distribution along the jet path is
obtained assuming local acceleration at the recollimation shock, and cooling
via adiabatic, synchrotron, and inverse Compton processes. The synchrotron and
inverse Compton emission is calculated taking into account synchrotron
self-absorption within the jet, free-free absorption with the stellar wind, and
absorption by stellar photons via pair production. Asymmetric light curves are
obtained owing to the helical trajectory of the jets. The presence of helical
shaped jets could be inferred from asymmetries in the light curves, which
become noticeable only for large jet Lorentz factors and low magnetic fields.
Model parameters could be constrained if accurate phase-resolved light curves
from GeV to TeV energies were available.

However, it's hard to ensure discriminability and explore complementary

deep separable features with only one cross-entropy loss, our proposed model
enhances the discriminative power of the deeply learned features and reduces
the undesired modality discrepancy by jointly optimizing a modality ranking
constraint and a cross-entropy loss for both homogeneous and heterogeneous
modalities. The modality ranking constraint constitutes intra-modality
discriminative embedding and inter-modality triplet constraint, and it reduces
both the intra-modality and cross-modality feature variations. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that by cooperating appearance and motion
feature extraction, our method can achieve state-of-the-art or competitive

disturbances to the electrodes are in the same frequency and magnitude range as

measurement system to combine EMG and bioimpedance measurements for higher
reliabilities of muscle contraction detections. Methods: We propose the
development of a modular four-channel measurement system, whereat each channel
is capable of acquiring EMG, the bioimpedance magnitude and phase,
simultaneously. The modules are synchronized by an additional interface board,
which communicates with a PC. A graphical user interface enables to control the
bioimpedance excitation current in a range from 100 {\mu}A to 1 mA in a
frequency range from 50 kHz to 333 kHz. Results: A system characterization
demonstrated that bioimpedance magnitude changes of less than 250 ppm and phase
changes below 0.05{\deg} can be detected reliably. Measurements from a subject
have shown the timing relationship between EMG and bioimpedance signals as well
as their robustness against mechanical disturbances. A measurement of five
exemplary hand gestures has demonstrated the increase of usable information for
detecting muscle contractions. Conclusion: Bioimpedance measurements of muscles
provide useful information about contractions. Furthermore, the usage of a
known high-frequency excitation current enables a reliable differentiation

prominent channels of revenue for many e-commerce companies. A user's attention
is mostly captured by homepage banner images (also called Ads/Creatives). The
set of banners shown and their design, influence the customer's interest and
plays a key role in optimizing the click through rates of the banners.
Presently, massive and repetitive effort is put in, to manually create
aesthetically pleasing banner images. Due to the large amount of time and
effort involved in this process, only a small set of banners are made live at
any point. This reduces the number of banners created as well as the degree of
personalization that can be achieved. This paper thus presents a method to
generate creatives automatically on a large scale in a short duration. The
availability of diverse banners generated helps in improving personalization as
they can cater to the taste of larger audience. The focus of our paper is on
generating wide variety of homepage banners that can be made as an input for
user level personalization engine. Following are the main contributions of this
paper: 1) We introduce and explain the need for large scale banner generation
for e-commerce 2) We present on how we utilize existing deep learning based
detectors which can automatically annotate the required objects/tags from the
image. 3) We also propose a Genetic Algorithm based method to generate an
optimal banner layout for the given image content, input components and other
design constraints. 4) Further, to aid the process of picking the right set of
banners, we designed a ranking method and evaluated multiple models. All our
experiments have been performed on data from Myntra (http://www.myntra.com),
one of the top fashion e-commerce players in India.

solve complex optimization problems. Tunneling events also occur during
projective quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) simulations, and in a class of problems
characterized by a double-well energy landscape their rate was found to scale
linearly with the first energy gap, i.e., even more favorably than in physical
quantum annealers, where the rate scales with the gap squared. Here we
investigate how a guiding wave function --- which is essential to make
many-body PQMC simulations computationally feasible --- affects the tunneling
rate. The chosen testbeds are a continuous-space double-well problem, the
ferromagnetic quantum Ising chain, and the recently introduced shamrock model.
As guiding wave function, we consider an approximate Boltzmann-type ansatz, the
numerically-exact ground state of the double-well model, and a neural-network
wave function based on a Boltzmann machine. Remarkably, for each ansatz we find
the same asymptotic linear scaling of the tunneling rate that was previously
found in the PQMC simulations performed without a guiding wave function. We
also provide a semiclassical theory for the double-well with exact guiding wave
function that explains the observed linear scaling. These findings suggest that
PQMC simulations guided by an accurate ansatz represent a valuable benchmark
for physical quantum annealers and a potentially competitive quantum-inspired
optimization technique.

analysis, we consider the heavy quark contributions to the diffractive DIS in

using the standard ""Hessian error propagation"" which served to provide a more

first time, by including the nonperturbative higher twist (HT) effects in the
calculation of diffractive DIS cross sections which are particularly important

the extracted diffractive PDFs are investigated upon inclusion of HT effects.

optimized and flexible parameterizations of diffractive PDFs, the inclusion of

present the extracted diffractive PDFs with and without the presence of HT
effects, and discuss the fit quality and the stability upon variations of the

comprehensive picture of the effects of a new treatment. The resulting
multidimensional insight contributes to clinically relevant and efficient
decision-making about treatment superiority. Common statistical procedures to
make these superiority decisions with multiple outcomes have two important
shortcomings however: 1) Outcome variables are often modeled individually, and
consequently fail to consider the relation between outcomes; and 2) superiority
is often defined as a relevant difference on a single, on any, or on all
outcomes(s); and lacks a compensatory mechanism that allows large positive
effects on one or multiple outcome(s) to outweigh small negative effects on
other outcomes. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes 1) a
Bayesian model for the analysis of correlated binary outcomes based on the
multivariate Bernoulli distribution; and 2) a flexible decision criterion with
a compensatory mechanism that captures the relative importance of the outcomes.
A simulation study demonstrates that efficient and unbiased decisions can be
made while Type I error rates are properly controlled. The performance of the
framework is illustrated for 1) fixed, group sequential, and adaptive designs;
and 2) non-informative and informative prior distributions.

  Our main result is a new in-place data structure for the partial sum problem
that only stores a constant number of ultraword in addition to the input and
supports operations in doubly logarithmic time. This matches the best known
time bounds for the problem (among polynomial space data structures) while
improving the space from superlinear to a constant number of ultrawords. Our
results are based on a simple and elegant in-place word RAM data structure,

accurate predictions to be made at $O(\alpha_{em})$ for leptonic decay rates

stems from a live subject (i.e., bona fide) or from an artificial replica is a
mandatory issue which has received a lot of attention recently. Nowadays, when
the materials for the fabrication of the Presentation Attack Instruments (PAIs)

Based on that fact, we propose a new PAD technique based on three image
representation approaches combining local and global information of the

we can correctly discriminate bona fide from attack presentations in the
aforementioned scenarios. The experimental evaluation of our proposal over the

when plants are illuminated is correlated with the photosynthetic rate.
However, practically, the bioelectric potential is affected by various

bioelectric potential response and the illuminating parameters using a neural
network to improve the accuracy of the photosynthetic rate evaluation. The
variation of the illuminating colors to the plant affected the relationship
between the amplitude of the bioelectric potential response and the

coefficient between the actual measured photosynthetic rate and the estimated
photosynthetic rate by the neural network is 0.95. The photosynthetic rate
evaluation using the bioelectric potential response is improved and this
correlation coefficient is greater than that analyzed by the neural network

obstacles. In particular, a robust Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)
scheme is presented for the case of underactuated Autonomous Underwater

purpose of the controller is to steer the underactuated AUV to a desired

constantly updated on-line via the vehicle's on-board sensors. In particular,
by considering a ball that covers the volume of the system, obstacle avoidance

uncertainties and the presence of external disturbances representing ocean

are assumed to be dark matter dominated systems at all radii. These dwarf
irregular galaxies are rotationally supported with relatively simple kinematics
which lead to small uncertainties on their dark matter distribution profiles.
In 2018, the H.E.S.S. telescopes observed the irregular dwarf galaxy
Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) for a live time of 19 hours. These observations are
the very first ones made by an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope toward
this kind of object. We search for a DM signal looking for an excess of gamma
rays over the background in the direction of the WLM galaxy. We present the
first results obtained on the velocity weighted cross section for DM
self-annihilation as a function of DM particle mass.

both pedestrian detection and person re-identification. Besides the large

varying poses, background clutters in the detected pedestrian bounding boxes
further deteriorate the extracted features for each person, making them less
discriminative. To tackle these problems, we develop a novel approach which
guides the network with segmentation masks so that discriminative features can
be learned invariant to the background clutters. We demonstrate that joint
optimization of pedestrian detection, person re-identification and pedestrian

symmetric channel is investigated numerically considering both the no-flow and
the reflection boundary conditions at the channel boundaries. Here, the
geometrical confinement leads to entropic barriers which effectively control
the transport properties of the particles. We show that compared to no-flow
boundary conditions, the transport properties exhibit distinct features in a
channel with reflection boundary conditions. For example, the nonlinear
mobility exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the scaling
parameter $f$, which is a ratio of the work done to the particles to available
thermal energy. Also, the effective diffusion exhibits a rapidly increasing
behavior at higher $f$. The nature of reflection, i.e., elastic or inelastic,
also influences the transport properties firmly. We find that inelastic
reflections increase both the mobility and the effective diffusion for smaller
$f$. In addition, by including the short range interaction force between the
Brownian particles, the mobility decreases and the effective diffusion
increases for various values of $f$. These findings, which are a signature of
the entropic nature of the system, can be useful to understand the transport of
small particles or molecules in systems such as microfluidic channels, membrane

can be produced in the blazar jet via hadronic interactions, but with a flux
which is mostly limited by the X-ray data. In this work, we explore the
neutrino production from TXS 0506+056 by invoking two physically distinct
emission zones in the jet, separated by the broad line region (BLR). Using the
Doppler-boosted radiation of the BLR as the target photon field, the inner zone
accounts for the neutrino and gamma-ray emission via $p\gamma$ interactions and
inverse Compton scattering respectively, while the outer zone produces the
optical and X-ray emission via synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton
processes. The different conditions of the two zones allow us to suppress the
X-ray emission from the electromagnetic cascade, and set a much higher upper
limit on the muon neutrino flux (i.e., $\sim 10^{-11}\rm erg~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$)

main challenge lies in the fact that it's very complicated to give a precise
definition of what is and what is not a landmark. Some buildings, statues and
natural objects are landmarks; others are not. There's also no database with a
fairly large number of landmarks to train a recognition model. A key feature of
using landmark recognition in a production environment is that the number of
photos containing landmarks is extremely small. This is why the model should
have a very low false positive rate as well as high recognition accuracy.
  We propose a metric learning-based approach that successfully deals with
existing challenges and efficiently handles a large number of landmarks. Our
method uses a deep neural network and requires a single pass inference that
makes it fast to use in production. We also describe an algorithm for cleaning

used as a technique to deal with the fundamental issue of word mismatch between
a user's query and the target information. In the context of the relationship
between the query and expanded terms, existing weighting techniques often fail
to appropriately capture the term-term relationship and term to the whole query
relationship, resulting in low retrieval effectiveness. Our proposed QE
approach addresses this by proposing three weighting models based on (1)
tf-itf, (2) k-nearest neighbor (kNN) based cosine similarity, and (3)
correlation score. Further, to extract the initial set of expanded terms, we
use pseudo-relevant web knowledge consisting of the top N web pages returned by
the three popular search engines namely, Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, in
response to the original query. Among the three weighting models, tf-itf scores
each of the individual terms obtained from the web content, kNN-based cosine
similarity scores the expansion terms to obtain the term-term relationship, and
correlation score weighs the selected expansion terms with respect to the whole
query. The proposed model, called web knowledge based query expansion (WKQE),
achieves an improvement of 25.89% on the MAP score and 30.83% on the GMAP score
over the unexpanded queries on the FIRE dataset. A comparative analysis of the
WKQE techniques with other related approaches clearly shows significant
improvement in the retrieval performance. We have also analyzed the effect of
varying the number of pseudo-relevant documents and expansion terms on the
retrieval effectiveness of the proposed model.

Large-scale mobility data serves as an important tool to uncover the dynamics

Specifically, we propose a robust tensor recovery problem to recover low rank

identify events, and impute missing data under typical conditions. Our approach
is scalable to large urban areas, taking full advantage of the spatio-temporal
correlations in traffic patterns. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve
the tensor recovery problem based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) framework. Compared with existing $l_1$ norm regularized
tensor decomposition methods, our algorithm can exactly recover the values of
uncorrupted fibers of a low rank tensor and find the positions of corrupted
fibers under mild conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate that our
algorithm can exactly detect outliers even with missing data rates as high as
40%, conditioned on the outlier corruption rate and the Tucker rank of the low
rank tensor. Finally, we apply our method on a real traffic dataset

to the close pairs (e.g. resonance decays, jet correlations), whereas the
back-to-back pairs are relatively free of those backgrounds.

observable which only focuses on the back-to-back pairs, namely, the relative
back-to-back opposite-sign (OS) over same-sign (SS) pair excess
($r_{\text{BB}}$) as a function of the pair azimuthal orientation with respect

  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We use analytical calculations and toy model simulations
to demonstrate the sensitivity of $r_{\text{BB}}(\varphi_{\text{BB}})$ to the
CME and its insensitivity to backgrounds.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ With finite CME, the $\varphi_{\text{BB}}$ distribution
of $r_{\text{BB}}$ shows a clear characteristic modulation. Its sensitivity to
background is significantly reduced compared to the previous $\Delta\gamma$
observable. The simulation results are consistent with our analytical
calculations.

Multiscale or multi-resolution methodologies address this difficulty by using
molecular dynamics (MD) and coarse-grained models in different parts of the
cell. Their applicability depends on the accuracy and properties of the
coarse-grained model which approximates the detailed MD description. A family
of stochastic coarse-grained (SCG) models, written as relatively
low-dimensional systems of nonlinear stochastic differential equations, is
presented. The nonlinear SCG model incorporates the non-Gaussian force
distribution which is observed in MD simulations and which cannot be described
by linear models. It is shown that the nonlinearities can be chosen in such a
way that they do not complicate parametrization of the SCG description by
detailed MD simulations. The solution of the SCG model is found in terms of
gamma functions.

explicitly, that inequality has been found to be an equality. In contrast, we
show in this paper that for graphs of bounded degree the inequality is strict,
i.e. we show existence of an interval of values of $\beta$ where there are no
infinite loops, but infinite percolation clusters almost surely.

question is how does a hierarchical network evolve over time? Here we take a
data driven approach and examine the time evolution of the network between the
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) provided by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI, part of the U. S. National Library of
Medicine). The network between the MeSH terms is organised into 16 different,
yearly updated hierarchies such as ""Anatomy"", ""Diseases"", ""Chemicals and
Drugs"", etc. The natural representation of these hierarchies is given by
directed acyclic graphs, composed of links pointing from nodes higher in the
hierarchy towards nodes in lower levels. Due to the yearly updates, the
structure of these networks is subject to constant evolution: new MeSH terms
can appear, terms becoming obsolete can be deleted or be merged with other
terms, and also already existing parts of the network may be rewired. We
examine various statistical properties of the time evolution, with a special
focus on the attachment and detachment mechanisms of the links, and find a few
general features that are characteristic for all MeSH hierarchies. According to
the results, the hierarchies investigated display an interesting interplay
between non-uniform preference with respect to multiple different topological
and hierarchical properties.

non-detections cannot exclude the young magnetar model of FRBs, we place
constraints on the burst rate and luminosity function of FRBs from these GRB

it is usually data hungry and struggles to learn over non-stationary data

from data stream over time without forgetting the previous knowledge. Limited
literature simultaneously address both problems. In this work, we propose a
novel approach, MetaCL, which enables neural networks to effectively learn meta

trains a model to exploit the intrinsic feature of data (i.e. meta knowledge)

learned knowledge. In this way, the deep learning model can efficiently obtain
new knowledge from small volume of data and still keep high performance on

encapsulation may affect also vibration properties of TMDs due to an atomically
flat surface of h-BN layers. In order to study its effect on interlayer
interactions in few-layer TMDs, we investigate low-energy Raman scattering
spectra of bi- and trilayer MoTe$_2$. Surprisingly, three breathing modes are
observed in the Raman spectra of the structures deposited on or encapsulated in
h-BN as compared to a single breathing mode for the flakes deposited on a
SiO$_2$/Si substrate. The shear mode is not affected by changing the MoTe$_2$
environment. The emerged structure of breathing modes is ascribed to the
apparent interaction between the MoTe$_2$ layer and the bottom h-BN flake. The
structure becomes visible due to a high-quality surface of the former flake.
Consequently, the observed triple structure of breathing modes originates from
the combination modes due to interlayer and layer-substrate interactions. Our
results confirm that the h-BN encapsulation affects substantially vibration
properties of layered materials.

the effect of dynamical friction against DM minispike on the evolution of
eccentric IMRI. For such investigation we construct the dynamical equations
which describes the evolution of eccentric IMRI under the effect of dynamical
friction. As dynamical friction is large for small velocity, the dissipation of
energy near apastron is more than that near periastron. This will greatly
enhance the eccentricity. For instance, with an initial semi-latus rectum of
$1\rm AU$, even a moderate DM minispike can make the eccentricity grow from
$0.3$ to $0.85$. In the extremal case the eccentricity could be enhanced to
near $1$. We also study a specific case which corresponds to an IMRI in the
center of a globular cluster (GC) and find the eccentricity can keep its value
above $0.95$ until the IMRI enters LISA band. These gravitational wave with
enhanced eccentricity by DM minispikes can be easly distinguished from that
without DM at $10^{-3}\rm Hz$ due to the eccentricity difference. These
anticipations can be tested by future space-based GW detectors such as LISA.

the detail-recovery mechanism, we propose an end-to-end detail-recovery image
deraining network (termed a DRD-Net) for single images. We for the first time
introduce two sub-networks with a comprehensive loss function which synergize
to derain and recover the lost details caused by deraining. We have three key
contributions. First, we present a rain residual network to remove rain streaks
from the rainy images, which combines the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) operation
with residual blocks to make full advantage of spatial contextual information.
Second, we design a new connection style block, named structure detail context
aggregation block (SDCAB), which aggregates context feature information and has
a large reception field. Third, benefiting from the SDCAB, we construct a
detail repair network to encourage the lost details to return for eliminating
image degradations. We have validated our approach on four recognized datasets
(three synthetic and one real-world). Both quantitative and qualitative
comparisons show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art deraining
methods in terms of the deraining robustness and detail accuracy. The source

Yang-Mills amplitudes, by applying proper differential operators which modify
the coefficients in the recursive expansion of single-trace Einstein-Yang-Mills
amplitudes. Next, through differential operators which act on amplitudes only,
we obtain expansions of amplitudes of Yang-Mills theory, Yang-Mills-scalar

Born-Infeld theory, Dirac-Born-Infeld theory and special Galileon theory. Then,
together with other results in literatures, the complete unified web is
achieved. This web for expansions is the dual version of the unified web for
differential operators. Thus, connections among amplitudes of a variety of
theories, which are reflected by Cachazo-He-Yuan integrands and differential
operators previously, can also be represented by expansions. We also find that
amplitudes of all theories in the web can be expanded to double color-ordered
bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes in the universal double copy formula.

is one of the most dangerous gases in the atmosphere, as it binds to the
hemoglobin in blood cells 200 times easier than O2. As the amount of CO in the
blood stream increases, the level of oxygen decreases, which can lead to many
neurological problems. To reduce the amount of CO in the atmosphere, scientists
have focused on the adsorption of oxygen. The best substrates used today are
platinum and palladium monolayers, which are very expensive. Because of this,
researchers have searched for cheap materials, such as MoS2, that are able to
adsorb oxygen. However, sulfur is a chemically inert site for the oxygen, which
greatly decreases the catalytic potential of monolayer MoS2 sheets. Therefore,
we carried out first-principles calculations to study the effect of
substitutional doping and creating sulfur vacancies on the catalytic properties
of MoS2. We calculated the adsorption energy of O on doped MoS2 sheets with
vacancies, and compared it to the adsorption energy of O on a Pd monolayer. We
found that doping MoS2 with Ir, Rh, Co and Fe significantly decreased the
adsorption energy, to below -4 eV, indicating that doped MoS2 is a more
effective catalyst than Pd. Incorporating sulfur vacancies into the doped MoS2
sheet was extremely effective, and decreased the adsorption energy below -6 eV.
Our results show that iridium is the best catalyst as it has the lowest
adsorption energy before and after sulfur vacancies were induced. We concluded
that a combination of doping and creating vacancies in monolayer MoS2 sheets
can greatly impact the catalytic behavior and make it a more effective, less
expensive catalyst than Pt and Pd.

to the talents of master painters. By finely combining colors at different
amounts on the palette intuitively, they obtain smooth gradients with any given
color. Creating such smooth color variations through scattering by the
structural patterning of a surface, as opposed to color pigments, has long
remained a challenge. Here, we borrow from the painter's approach and
demonstrate color mixing generated by an optical metasurface. We propose a
single-layer plasmonic color pixel and a method for nanophotonic structural
color mixing based on the additive RGB color model. The color pixels consist of
plasmonic nanorod arrays that generate vivid primary colors and enable
independent control of color brightness without affecting chromaticity, by
simply varying geometric in-plane parameters. By interleaving different nanorod
arrays, we combine up to three primary colors on a single pixel. Based on this,
two and three color mixing is demonstrated, enabling the continuous coverage of
a plasmonic RGB color gamut and yielding a palette with a virtually unlimited
number of colors. With this multi-resonant color pixel, we show the
photorealistic printing of color and monochrome images at the nanoscale, with
ultra-smooth transitions in color and brightness. Our color mixing approach can
be applied to a broad range of scatterer designs and materials, and has the
potential to be used for multi-wavelength color filters and dynamic

transverse momenta of baryons and mesons are growing with the hadron mass and
for beauty hadrons, they are almost equal to the mass. II. By the product of
research, a regularity has been detected in the mass gaps between hadron
generations. This hypothesis suggests some hidden symmetrical
(neither-meson-nor-baryon) neutral hadron states with the masses:
0.251,0.682,1.85,5.04,13.7,37.2,101.,275.,748.... GeV, which is produced by
geometrical progression with the mass factor of order delta(ln M)=1. III. The
baryon-meson symmetry seems broken until the mass of beauty hadrons, then the
hidden states should be more and more stable with the growth of the mass, so
the suggested sequence of hadronic states is a proper candidate for the Dark

strong user which converts light information received through the VLC link, and
forwards the information to the weak user via the RF link. The paper then
maximizes a network-wide weighted sum-rate, so as to jointly determine the
strong-weak user-pairs, the serving link of each weak user (i.e., either direct

two spherical particles of radii a suspended in a viscous shear flow neglects
the effect of the boundaries. In the present paper we study how a plane wall
modifies this interaction. Using an integral equation for the surface traction
we derive the expression for the particles' relative velocity as a sum of the
BG's velocity and the term due to the presence of a wall at finite distance,
z_0. Our calculation is not the perturbation theory of the BG solution, so the
contribution due to the wall is not necessarily small. The distance at which
the wall significantly alters the particles interaction scales as z_0^{3/5}.
The phase portrait of the particles' relative motion is different from the BG
theory, where there are two singly-connected regions of open and closed
trajectories both of infinite volume. For finite z_0, there is a new domain of
closed (dancing) and open (swapping) trajectories. The width of this region
behaves as 1/z_0. Along the swapping trajectories, that have been previously
observed numerically, the incoming particle is turning back after the encounter
with the reference particle, rather than passing it by, as in the BG theory.
The region of dancing trajectories has infinite volume. We found a
one-parameter family of equilibrium states, overlooked previously, whereas the
pair of spheres flows as a whole without changing its configuration. These
states are marginally stable and their perturbation yields a two-parameter
family of the dancing trajectories, where the particle is orbiting around a
fixed point in a frame co-moving with the reference particle. We suggest that
the phase portrait obtained at z_0>>a is topologically stable and can be
extended down to rather small z_0 of several particle diameters. We confirm
this by direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations with
z_0=5a.

pathological conditions. However, how these conditions are stabilized from
dis-regulation on the level of the single entities is still unclear. Here we
tackle this question using generic Hodgkin-Huxley type of models that describe
physiological bursting dynamics of pancreatic beta-cells, and introduce channel
dis-function to mimic pathological silent dynamics. The probability for
pathological behavior in beta-cell populations is $\sim100\%$ when all cell
have these defects, despite the negligible size of the silent state basin of
attraction for single cells. In stark contrast, in a more realistic scenario
for a heterogeneous population, stabilization of the pathological state depends
on the size of the sub-population which acquired the defects. However, the
probability to exhibit stable pathological dynamics in this case is less than
$\sim10\%$. These results therefore suggest that the physiological bursting
dynamics of a population of beta-cells is cooperatively regulated, even under
intercellular communication defects induced by dis-functional channels of

provide compelling evidence for the existence of Dirac nodal-line fermions in
the monoclinic semimetal SrAs$_3$, which are close to $E_F$ and away from
distraction of complex trivial Fermi surfaces or surface states. Our
calculation indicates that two bands with opposite parity are inverted around

the prediction of nodal-line fermions in the CaP$_3$ family of materials.

method called correlation-based TD initialization algorithm. As HSI is well
approximated by means of a reference band. In accordance with the SVD result of
the reference band, the initialized factor matrices of TD are produced. We
compare our methods with random and SVD-based initialization methods. The
experimental results reveal that our correlation-based TD initialization method
is capable of significantly reducing the computational cost of TD while keeping
the initialization quality and compression performance.

through separation of the control and data planes. It enables flexibility in
network management and control. Energy efficiency is one of the challenging
global problems which has both economic and environmental impact. A massive
amount of information is generated in the controller of an SDN based network.
Machine learning gives the ability to computers to progressively learn from
data without having to write specific instructions. In this work, we propose
MER-SDN: a machine learning framework for traffic-aware energy efficient
routing in SDN. Feature extraction, training, and testing are the three main
stages of the learning machine. Experiments are conducted on Mininet and POX
controller using real-world network topology and dynamic traffic traces from
SNDlib. Results show that our approach achieves more than 65\% feature size
reduction, more than 70% accuracy in parameter prediction of an energy
efficient heuristics algorithm, also our prediction refine heuristics converges
the predicted value to the optimal parameters values with up to 25X speedup as
compared to the brute force method.

is a prominent phenomenon arising during tectonic earthquakes. It is executed
here in a single `monolithic' model which can asymptotically capture both
damageable solids (rocks) and (visco-)elastic fluids (outer core or oceans).
Both ruptures on pre-existing lithospheric faults and a birth of new faults in
compact rocks are covered by this model, together with emission and propagation
of seismic waves, including, e.g., reflection of S-waves and refraction of
P-waves on the solid-fluid interfaces. A robust, energy conserving, and
convergent staggered FEM discretisation is devised. Using a rather simplified
variant of such models for rupture, three computational experiments documenting
the applicability of this approach are presented. Some extensions of the model
towards more realistic geophysical modelling are outlined, too.
