  Neural Nets","Major update: Several new results, some reorganization and rewriting
  of previous results, new references",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known that overparametrized neural networks trained using
gradient-based methods quickly achieve small training error with appropriate
hyperparameter settings. Recent papers have proved this statement theoretically
for highly overparametrized networks under reasonable assumptions. These
results either assume that the activation function is ReLU or they crucially
depend on the minimum eigenvalue of a certain Gram matrix depending on the
data, random initialization and the activation function. In the later case,
existing works only prove that this minimum eigenvalue is non-zero and do not
provide quantitative bounds. On the empirical side, a contemporary line of
investigations has proposed a number of alternative activation functions which
tend to perform better than ReLU at least in some settings but no clear
understanding has emerged. This state of affairs underscores the importance of
theoretically understanding the impact of activation functions on training. In
the present paper, we provide theoretical results about the effect of
activation function on the training of highly overparametrized 2-layer neural
networks. A crucial property that governs the performance of an activation is
whether or not it is smooth. For non-smooth activations such as ReLU, SELU and
ELU, all eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix are large under minimal
assumptions on the data. For smooth activations such as tanh, swish and
polynomials, the situation is more complex. If the subspace spanned by the data
has small dimension then the minimum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix can be small
leading to slow training. But if the dimension is large and the data satisfies
another mild condition, then the eigenvalues are large. If we allow deep
networks, then the small data dimension is not a limitation provided that the
depth is sufficient. We discuss a number of extensions and applications of
these results.

computation necessitates the development of massively parallel algorithms for
their solution. Recent advances in dense numerical linear algebra have enabled
the routine treatment of eigenvalue problems with dimensions on the order of
hundreds of thousands on the world's largest supercomputers. In cases where
dense treatments are not feasible, Krylov subspace methods offer an attractive
alternative due to the fact that they do not require storage of the problem
matrices. However, demonstration of scalability of either of these classes of
eigenvalue algorithms on computing architectures capable of expressing massive
parallelism is non-trivial due to communication requirements and serial
bottlenecks, respectively. In this work, we introduce the SISLICE method: a
parallel shift-invert algorithm for the solution of the symmetric
self-consistent field (SCF) eigenvalue problem. The SISLICE method drastically
reduces the communication requirement of current parallel shift-invert
eigenvalue algorithms through various shift selection and migration techniques
based on density of states estimation and k-means clustering, respectively.
This work demonstrates the robustness and parallel performance of the SISLICE
method on a representative set of SCF eigenvalue problems and outlines research
directions which will be explored in future work.

Second, we propose an adaptive regularization technique customized for ER that
ameliorates the issue of feature overfitting. Finally, we incorporate the

We describe and implement a method to estimate $H_0$ using both the counterpart

unbiased estimate of $H_0$. Our simulations used a simplified universe with no

treatment of both selection effects. We explore how the incompleteness of
catalogs affects the final measurement of $H_0$, as well as the effect of
weighting each galaxy's likelihood of being a host by its luminosity. In our
most realistic simulation, where the simulated catalog is about three times
denser than the density of galaxies in the local universe, we find that a 4.4\%

factor of 5-10 smaller. This chip instability in the camera significantly
reduces the astrometric precision when the reduction uses reference stars

that the instability introduces a bias in stellar positions with an amplitude

($H_0$) using the detections from the first and second observing runs of the
Advanced LIGO and Virgo detector network. The presence of the transient
electromagnetic counterpart of the binary neutron star GW170817 led to the
first standard-siren measurement of $H_0$. Here we additionally use binary
black hole detections in conjunction with galaxy catalogs and report a joint
measurement. Our updated measurement is $H_0 = 68.7^{+17.0}_{-7.8}$ km/s/Mpc
(68.3\% of the highest density posterior interval with a flat-in-log prior)
which is an improvement by a factor of 1.04 (about 4\%) over the GW170817-only
value of $68.7^{+17.5}_{-8.3}$ km/s/Mpc. A significant additional contribution
currently comes from GW170814, a loud and well-localized detection from a part
of the sky thoroughly covered by the Dark Energy Survey. With numerous
detections anticipated over the upcoming years, an exhaustive understanding of
other systematic effects are also going to become increasingly important. These
results establish the path to cosmology using gravitational-wave observations
with and without transient electromagnetic counterparts.

fields. We use for this purpose quantum electrodynamics in the covariant gauge.
We show that a finite one-loop result for such angular momentum can be obtained

unique problem: how can computational input and computation be hidden while

We achieve these results within the growth-only restricted abstract Tile

general-case covert computation is possible by implementing a set of basic
covert logic gates capable of simulating any circuit (functionally complete).
To further motivate the study of covert computation, we apply our new framework

show that the unique assembly verification problem within the growth-only aTAM

the mean-squared error sense. The data generated by the sensors is transmitted
to the corresponding estimators, over a bandwidth-constrained wireless network
that can support a single packet per time slot. The access to the limited
communication resources is determined by a scheduler who decides which sensor
measurement to transmit based on both observations. The scheduler has an
energy-harvesting battery of limited capacity, which couples the
decision-making problem in time. Despite the overall lack of convexity of the
team decision problem, it is shown that this system admits globally optimal
scheduling and estimation strategies under the assumption that the
distributions of the random variables at the sensors are symmetric and
unimodal. Additionally, the optimal scheduling policy has a structure
characterized by a threshold function that depends on the time index and energy
level. A recursive algorithm for threshold computation is provided.

analysis reveals a complex nuclear structure, with a young radio source
(Giga-hertz Peaked Spectrum) surrounded by a strong X-ray nuclear absorption, a
mid-infrared spectrum that is dominated by the torus emission, plus a
circum-nuclear extended emission in the [OIII] image (with radius of $\sim$ 1

large-scale extended emission (up to $\sim$ 10 kpc) is only visible in [OIII].
These data show conclusive evidence of a heavily absorbed nucleus and has

  Atlas provides data structures for building various numerical strategies to
solve equations on the sphere or limited area's on the sphere. These data
structures may contain a distribution of points (grid) and, possibly, a
composition of elements (mesh), required to implement the numerical operations
required. Atlas can also represent a given field within a specific spatial

of pre- and post-processing stages or as part of coupling processes whose
respective fields are discretised on different grids or meshes.

key metric of the evaluation is the performance portability of the resulting

performance portability additionally requires that the single source code runs
efficiently in all the different architectures.

  In today's computer architectures, moving data is considerably more time- and
energy consuming than computing on this data. One of the key performance
optimizations for any application is therefore to minimize data motion and
maximize data reuse. Especially on modern supercomputers with very complex and
deep memory hierarchies, it is mandatory to take data locality into account.
Especially when targeting accelerators with directive systems like OpenACC or
OpenMP, identifying data scope, access type and data reuse are critical to
minimize the data transfers from and to the accelerator. Unfortunately,
manually identifying data locality information in complex code bases can be a
time consuming task and tool support is therefore desirable.
  In this report we summarize the results of a survey of currently available
tools that support software developers and performance engineers with data
locality information in complex code bases like numerical weather prediction
(NWP) or climate simulation applications. Based on the survey results we then
recommend a tool and specify some extensions for a tool to solve the problems
encountered in an NWP application.

emit a significant fraction of their radiation as ionizing photons. They are
potentially important stellar sources of ionizing radiation, however, they are
still often neglected in spectral synthesis simulations or simulations of
stellar feedback. We modeled the radiative contribution from stripped stars by
using detailed evolutionary and spectral models. We estimated their impact on
the integrated spectra and specifically on the emission rates of HI-, HeI-, and
HeII-ionizing photons from stellar populations.
  We find that stripped stars have the largest impact on the ionizing spectrum
of a population in which star formation halted several Myr ago. In such stellar
populations, stripped stars dominate the emission of ionizing photons,
mimicking a younger stellar population in which massive stars are still
present. Our models also suggest that stripped stars have harder ionizing
spectra than massive stars.
  The additional ionizing radiation affects observable properties that are
related to the ionizing emission from stellar populations. In co-eval stellar
populations, the ionizing radiation from stripped stars increases the
ionization parameter and the production efficiency of HI-ionizing photons. They
also cause high values for these parameters for about ten times longer than
what is predicted for massive stars. The hard ionizing radiation from stripped
stars likely introduces a characteristic ionization structure of the nebula,
which leads to the emission of highly ionized elements such as O$^{2+}$ and
C$^{3+}$. We, therefore, expect that the presence of stripped stars affects the
location in the BPT diagram and the diagnostic ratio of OIII to OII nebular
emission lines. Our models are publicly available through CDS database and on

O-type stars that are their putative progenitors in single-star evolution,
implicating LBVs as binary evolution products. Aadland et al. (A19) found that
LBVs are, however, only marginally more dispersed than a photometrically
selected sample of bright blue stars (BBS) in the LMC, leading them to suggest
that LBV environments may not exclude a single-star origin. In both
comparisons, LBVs have the same median separation, confirming that any
incompleteness in the O-star sample does not fabricate LBV isolation. Instead,
the relative difference arises because the photometric BBS sample is far more
dispersed than known O-type stars. Evidence suggests that the large BBS
separation arises because it traces less massive (~20 Msun), aging blue
supergiants. Although photometric criteria used by A19 aimed to select only the
most massive unevolved stars, visual-wavelength color selection cannot avoid
contamination because O and early B stars have almost the same intrinsic color.
Spectral types confirm that the BBS sample contains many B supergiants.
Moreover, the observed BBS separation distribution matches that of
spectroscopically confirmed early B supergiants, not O-type stars, and matches
predictions for a ~10 Myr population, not a 3-4 Myr population. A broader
implication for ages of stellar populations is that bright blue stars are not a
good tracer of the youngest massive O-type stars. Bright blue stars in nearby
galaxies (and unresolved blue light in distant galaxies) generally trace
evolved blue supergiants akin to SN 1987A's progenitor.

stellar mass distribution. The stellar and baryonic RAR are known to exhibit
similar scatter. Lelli+2017 (L17) studied the baryonic RAR using a sample of
153 spiral galaxies and inferred a negligible intrinsic scatter. If true, a
small scatter might challenge the LCDM galaxy formation paradigm, possibly
favoring a modified Newtonian dynamics interpretation. The intrinsic scatter of
the baryonic RAR is predicted by modern LCDM simulations to be ~0.06-0.08 dex,
contrasting with the null value reported by L17. We have assembled a catalog of
structural properties with over 2500 spiral galaxies from six deep imaging and

finite currents and then the insulators become metallic. This phenomenon is
called dielectric breakdown and known as a fundamental nonequilibrium and
nonlinear transport phenomenon in solids. Here, we study the dielectric
breakdown of generic strongly correlated insulators in one dimension. Combining
bosonization techniques with a theory of quantum tunneling, we develop an

threshold field which is a many-body generalization of the Landau-Zener
formula. Importantly, we point out that the threshold field contains a
previously overlooked factor originating from charges of elementary
excitations, which should be significant when a system has fractionalized
excitations. We apply our results to integrable lattice models and confirm that
our formula is valid in a broad range including the weak coupling regime,
indicating its wide and potential applicability. Our results unveil universal

and two white dwarfs are now observed to contain orbiting minor planets.
Exoasteroids and planetary core fragments achieve orbits close to the white
dwarf through scattering with major planets. However, the architectures that
allow for this scattering to take place are time-consuming to explore with
$N$-body simulations lasting $\sim 10^{10}$ yr; these long-running simulations
restrict the amount of phase space that can be investigated. Here we use planar
and three-dimensional (spatial) elliptic periodic orbits, as well as chaotic
indicators through dynamical stability maps, as quick scale-free analytic
alternatives to $N$-body simulations in order to locate and predict instability
in white dwarf planetary systems that consist of one major and one minor planet
on very long timescales. We then classify the instability according to ejection
versus collisional events. We generalized our previous work by allowing
eccentricity and inclination of the periodic orbits to increase, thereby adding
more realism but also significantly more degrees of freedom to our
architectures. We also carried out a suite of computationally expensive 10 Gyr
$N$-body simulations to provide comparisons with chaotic indicators in a
limited region of phase space. We compute dynamical stability maps that are
specific to white dwarf planetary systems and that can be used as tools in
future studies to quickly estimate pollution prospects and timescales for
one-planet architectures. We find that these maps also agree well with the
outcomes of our $N$-body simulations. As observations of metal-polluted white
dwarfs mount exponentially, particularly in the era of Gaia, tools such as
periodic orbits can help infer dynamical histories for ensembles of systems.

To address this problem, we first introduce 3RScan, a novel dataset and

time steps. Each scene includes several objects whose positions change over
time, together with ground truth annotations of object instances and their

introduce a new data-driven approach that efficiently finds matching features

spatial scales. Combined with a 6DoF pose optimization, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines on our newly-established benchmark, achieving an

allows to bring a selected magnon mode into and out of a dark mode, providing
an alternative for a quantum memory protocol. The dynamical features of the

also suffers from significant under learning on some other classes (""hard""

avoid overfitting to noisy labels. Inspired by the symmetric KL-divergence, we
propose the approach of \textbf{Symmetric cross entropy Learning} (SL),
boosting CE symmetrically with a noise robust counterpart Reverse Cross Entropy
(RCE). Our proposed SL approach simultaneously addresses both the under

the relative importance of prompt and delayed enrichment mechanisms, while the

APOGEE measurements agree for some of their common elements, but differ in
sequence separation or metallicity trends for others. GALAH offers access to
nine new elements. We infer that about $75\%$ of solar C comes from core

the forecast part dwarfs everything else and is responsible for up to 99% of
the total energy consumption. This means that energy optimizations for the

whole suite, while the maximum theoretical speed-up due to forecast
optimizations cannot exceed a factor of about 3/2. Therefore, in terms of
energy consumption, optimizations should first focus on the forecast part. For
wall-clock time performance gains, however, optimizations (and possibly
additional dwarfs) can be considered for the categories outside of the forecast
part.

lifetime of excited electrons in these states is limited by both
electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering. We employ the
description by a master equation for the electronic occupation numbers to
analyze the relative importance of both scattering mechanisms. The electronic
and phononic band structures, as well as the matrix elements for
electron-phonon coupling within deformation potential theory were obtained from
density functional calculations, thus taking into account quantum confinement
effects. For the relaxation dynamics, the contribution of impact ionization
processes to the lifetime is estimated from the imaginary part of the
electronic self-energy calculated in the GW approximation. By numerically
solving rate equations for the occupations of the Pb-derived electronic states
coupled to a phononic heat bath, we are able to follow the distribution of the
electronic excitation energy to the various modes of Pb lattice vibrations.
While e-e scattering is the dominant relaxation mechanism, we demonstrate that
the e-ph scattering is highly phonon-mode-specific, with a large contribution
from surface phonons. At electron energies of about 0.3 eV above the Fermi
surface, a 'phonon bottleneck' characteristic of relaxation in nanostructures
with well-separated electronic states is observed. The time scales extracted
from the simulations are compared to data from pump-probe experiments using

relation between the surface and bulk order parameters. As a first approach to
tackle more general and nonlinear relations, we investigate the existence of
unique weak solutions to a regularisation by a Robin boundary condition.
Included in our analysis is the case where there is no diffusion for the
surface order parameter, which causes new difficulties for the analysis of the
Robin system. Furthermore, for the case of affine linear relations, we show the
weak convergence of solutions as the regularisation parameter tends to zero,
and derive an error estimate between the two models. This is supported by
numerical experiments which also demonstrate some non-trivial dynamics for the
extended Liu--Wu model that is not present in the original model.

ultrafast optical spectroscopy of quantum materials allows to controllably
induce and probe non-adiabatic dynamics of superconductors and superfluids. The
time-evolution of the gap function before relaxation with the lattice is
determined by the superposition of coherently evolving individual Cooper pairs
within the manifold of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wavefunction. While
dynamics following an abrupt quench of the pairing interaction strength in the
single-band BCS model has been exactly solved due to the integrability of the
model, the dynamics of post-quench multi-band superconductors remain under
scrutiny. Here, we develop a generalization of the Volkov-Kogan Laplace-space
perturbative method that allows us to determine the non-adiabatic gap dynamics
of two-band fully gapped superconductors for a wide range of quench amplitudes.
Our approach expands the long-time dynamics around the steady-state asymptotic
value of the gap, which is self-consistently determined, rather than around the
equilibrium value of the gap. We explicitly demonstrate that this method
recovers the exact solution of the long-time gap dynamics in the single-band
case and perfectly agrees with a numerical solution of the two-band model. We
discover that dephasing of Cooper pairs from different bands leads to faster
collisionless relaxation of the gap oscillation with a power-law of $t^{-3/2}$
instead of the well-known $t^{-1/2}$ behavior found in the single-band case.
Furthermore, the gap oscillations display beating patterns arising from the
existence of two different asymptotic gap values. Our results have important
implications to a variety of two-band superconductors driven out of
equilibrium, such as iron-based superconductors, MgB$_{2}$, and SrTiO$_{3}$.

complicated questions. This progress can be partially attributed to the recent
success of machine learning and to the efficient methods for storing and

imagine that this general-purpose question-answering system can be built as a
billion-parameters neural network trained end-to-end with a large number of

efficient way is to train an artificial agent on how to use an external
retrieval system to collect relevant information. This agent can leverage the
effort that has been put into designing and running efficient storage and
retrieval systems by learning how to best utilize them to accomplish a task.

initial learning bias and the experience gained through learning. The
properties of such models are discussed and, in particular, it is shown that
probabilities deviate from Luce's Choice Axiom, even if the initial bias
adheres to it. Moreover, we shown that the latter property is recovered as the

  Two applications in utility theory are considered. In the first, we use the
discrete choice model to generate binary preference relation on simple
lotteries. We show that the preferences violate transitivity and independence
axioms of expected utility theory. Furthermore, we establish the dependence of
the preferences on frames, with risk aversion for gains, and risk seeking for
losses. Based on these findings we propose next a parametric model of choice
based on the probability maximization principle, as a model for deviations from
expected utility principle. To illustrate the approach we apply it to the

tensor form factors of the nucleon can be well fitted to the multipole fit
form. We compare the results obtained for the form factors at $ Q^2=0 $ with
the existing theoretical predictions as well as experimental data on the
gravitational form factor d$_1^q(0)$. For the form factors M$_2^q (0)$ and
J$^q(0)$ a consistency among the theoretical predictions is seen within the
errors: Our results are nicely consistent with the Lattice QCD and chiral
perturbation theory predictions. However, there are large discrepancies among
the theoretical predictions on d$_1^q(0)$. Nevertheless, our prediction is in

heterogeneous, which can affect the way a disease spreads through a population,
reaches a tipping point in the fraction of infected individuals, and becomes an
epidemic. This property, called disorder, is usually associated with contact
times between individuals and can be modeled by a weighted network, where the
weights are related to normalized contact times $\omega$. In this paper, we
study the SIR model for disease spreading when both close and distant types of
interactions are present. We develop a mitigation strategy that reduces only
the time duration of distant contacts, which are easier to alter in practice.
Using branching theory, supported by simulations, we found that the
effectiveness of the strategy increases when the density $f_1$ of close
contacts decreases. Moreover, we found a threshold $\tilde{f}_1 = T_c / \beta$
below which the strategy can bring the system from an epidemic to a
non-epidemic phase, even when close contacts have the longest time durations.

technology, pure $CO_2$ is injected into an underground geological formation
and since it is less dense than residual fluids, there is always a risk of
leakage to the surface. To increase security of underground $CO_2$ disposal,
ex-situ dissolution can be implemented. When $CO_2$ is dissolved in brine
before injection, it significantly reduces the risks of leakage. In this
approach, pure $CO_2$ is dissolved on the surface before injection. Surface
dissolution could be achieved in a pipeline operating under the pressure of a
target aquifer into which the $CO_2$ is injected. In a pipeline, $CO_2$
droplets are dissolved being dispersed in a brine turbulent flow. In this
paper, a comprehensive model of droplet dissolution along a pipeline is
presented. The model accounts for droplet breakup and coalescence processes and

independent sources of bias in the photometric zero-points are identified:
First, high sky backgrounds severely affect the $H$-band measurements, but this
can mostly be minimized by strict data vetting. Secondly, during the zero-point
calibration, stars serving as standards are taken from the 2MASS catalog, which
can suffer from high degrees of blending in regions of high stellar density,
affecting both the absolute photometric calibration, as well as the scatter of
repeated observations. The former affects studies that rely on an absolute

relatively simple modifications of the standard calibration procedure, and

incineration of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf stellar remnant. However, the
detailed explosion scenario and stellar evolutionary origin scenario -- or
scenarios -- which lead to observed supernovae are still quite uncertain. One
of the principal tests of proposed scenarios is comparison with the explosion
products inferred, for example, from the spectrum of the supernovae. Making
this comparison requires computation of the combustion dynamics and products
through simulation of proposed scenarios. Here we discuss two specific proposed
explosion scenarios, the deflagration-detonation transition and the helium
shell double detonation, With these two examples in mind, we proceed to discuss
challenges to computational modeling of the combustion taking place in these
explosions. Both subsonically and supersonically propagating reaction fronts
are discussed, called deflagrations and detonations respectively. Several major
stages of the combustion occur on length and time scales that are many orders
of magnitude smaller than those accessible in simulations of the explosion.
Models which attempt to capture this sub-grid behavior and the verification of
those models is briefly discussed.

suite, named CLUTRR, to clarify some key issues related to the robustness and
systematicity of NLU systems. Motivated by classic work on inductive logic
programming, CLUTRR requires that an NLU system infer kinship relations between
characters in short stories. Successful performance on this task requires both
extracting relationships between entities, as well as inferring the logical
rules governing these relationships. CLUTRR allows us to precisely measure a
model's ability for systematic generalization by evaluating on held-out
combinations of logical rules, and it allows us to evaluate a model's
robustness by adding curated noise facts. Our empirical results highlight a
substantial performance gap between state-of-the-art NLU models (e.g., BERT and
MAC) and a graph neural network model that works directly with symbolic
inputs---with the graph-based model exhibiting both stronger generalization and
greater robustness.

objects: Eccentric Kuiper Objects of type I (EKO-I) whose perihelion is
comparable to, but always smaller than the aphelion of the initial KO and
Eccentric Kuiper Objects of type II (EKO-II) whose perihelion can be as small
as a few AU. EKO-I tend to have a fairly large range of eccentricities, but
EKO-II tend to have very large eccentricities. Both tend to be produced in
clusters similar to those observed in Extreme TransNeptunian Objects (ETNO).
When a WCO crosses the path of an EKO-I, it will produce two main classes of
objects: Far Kuiper Objects (FKO) of types I and II. The Sednitos discovered in
the past years fit the FKO-I class with their large major axis and fairly large
eccentricity, while the FKO-II class is different with its large major axis but
smaller eccentricity and opposite spinning direction. When a WCO encounters an
EKO-II, the latter can remain in the same class, spinning in either direction,
it can also en up in the EKO-I class also spinning in either direction, but it
can also be sent onto orbits with extremely long semi-major axis, relatively
small eccentricity where both spins are allowed. This FKO-III class could be
likened to the Lower Oort Cloud Objects as their major axis is a fair fraction
of a light-year. These results lead us to consider the possibility that the

from a concatenated linear and non-linear convolution layers and a learnable

field and more accurate alignment compared to using only linear convolutions

disagreements that are due to topological changes. Our experiments demonstrate
that this approach manages to capture large non-linear deformations and
minimizes the propagation of interpolation errors. While improving accuracy the

different companion masses. Our simulations help to delineate regimes when
conventional analytic drag force approximations are applicable. During and just
prior to the first periastron passage of the in-spiral phase, the drag force is
reasonably approximated by conventional analytic theory and peaks at values
proportional to the companion mass. Good agreement between global and local 3D
""wind tunnel"" simulations, including similar net drag force and flow pattern,
is obtained for comparable regions of parameter space. However, subsequent to
the first periastron passage, the drag force is up to an order of magnitude
smaller than theoretical predictions, quasi-steady, and depends only weakly on
companion mass. The discrepancy is exacerbated for larger companion mass and
when the inter-particle separation reduces to the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
accretion radius, creating a turbulent thermalized region. Greater flow
symmetry during this phase leads to near balance of opposing gravitational
forces in front of and behind the companion, hence a small net drag. The
reduced drag force at late times helps explain why companion-core separations

computation of the Bell correlation requires explicit use of an entangled
state. Such a physical superposition of light waves occurs in the downconverter
sources used in Bell experiments. However, this physical superposition is
eliminated by wave propagation to spatially separated detectors. Bell
correlations must therefore result from local waves, and the source boundary
conditions of their previously entangled state. In the present model, Bell
correlations are computed from disentangled separated waves, boundary
conditions of nonlinear optics, and properties of single photon and vacuum
states specified by quantum electrodynamics. Transient interference is assumed
between photon excited waves and photon empty waves based on the possibility of
such interference found to be necessary by the designers of Bell experiment
sources. The present model employs local random variables without specifying
underlying causality

categories, typically used to organize bimodules in various contexts. However

extended our understanding of light-matter interactions and our ability to

interacting with bound electron systems - such as atoms, molecules, quantum
dots, and quantum circuits. In contrast, markedly different physical phenomena
are found in free-electron systems, the energy distribution of which is
continuous and not discrete, implying tunable transitions and selection rules.
In addition to their uses for electron microscopy, the interaction of free
electrons with light enables important phenomena such as Cherenkov radiation,
Compton scattering, and free-electron lasing. However, no experiment has shown
the integration of free electrons into the framework of CQED, because the
fundamental electron-light interaction is limited in strength and lifetime.
This limit explains why many phenomena have remained out of reach for
experiments with free electrons. In this work, we developed the platform for
studying CQED at the nanoscale with free electrons and demonstrated it by
observing their coherent interaction with cavity photons for the first time. We
also directly measure the cavity photon lifetime via a free electron probe and
show more than an order of magnitude enhancement in the electron-photon
interaction strength. These capabilities may open new paths toward using free
electrons as carriers of quantum information, even more so after strong
coupling between free electrons and cavity photons will have been demonstrated.
Efficient electron-cavity photon coupling could also allow new nonlinear
phenomena of cavity opto-electro-mechanics and the ultrafast exploration of
soft matter or other beam-sensitive materials using low electron current and
low laser exposure.

that the initial state momentum anisotropy is correlated with the observed

ORPT consists of sections of multiple levels (e.g., sections and subsections).
None of the existing multi-document summarization (MDS) algorithms is directed
toward this task. To overcome this obstacle, we present NDORGS (Numerous
Documents' Overview Report Generation Scheme) that integrates text filtering,
keyword scoring, single-document summarization (SDS), topic modeling, MDS, and
title generation to generate a coherent, well-structured ORPT. We then devise a
multi-criteria evaluation method using techniques of text mining and
multi-attribute decision making on a combination of human judgments, running
time, information coverage, and topic diversity. We evaluate ORPTs generated by
NDORGS on two large corpora of documents, where one is classified and the other

have a thermal component from the polar cap and a non-thermal component from
the magnetosphere. Although the phase-integrated spectra are fit best with a
single non-thermal component modeled with a power-law (PL) of photon index
$\Gamma=2.9$, the X-ray pulse profiles do show the presence of phase-separated
thermal and non-thermal components. The spectrum extracted from half the
rotational phase away from the X-ray peak fits well with either a single
blackbody (BB) or a neutron star atmosphere (NA) model, whereas, the spectrum
from the rest of the phase range is dominated by a PL. From Bayesian analysis,
the estimated BB area is smaller than the expected polar cap area for a dipolar
magnetic field with a probability of 86% whereas the area estimate from the NA
model is larger with a probability of 80%. Due to the ambiguity in the thermal
emission model, the polar cap area cannot be reliably estimated and hence
cannot be used to understand the nature of the surface magnetic field. Instead,
we can infer the presence of multipolar magnetic field from the misalignment
between the pulsar's thermal X-ray peak and the radio emission peak. For
J0108$-$1431, we estimated a phase-offset $\Delta\phi > 0.1$ between the

the interpolation scheme. Among others, we introduce an interpolation scheme
termed symmetrized finite particle method. The main advantage of the scheme is
that its implementation does not involve any derivative of the kernel function.
Concerning the equation of motion, the calculations are carried out using two
distinct scenarios where the particles are chosen to be either stationary or

using the standard finite difference method for spatial derivatives. Our
numerical results indicate subtle differences between different schemes

consider a quantum algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, wherein a

appropriately reduces both the computational complexities and size of a quantum

This framework integrates the key components of Multi-Criteria Decision Making

Algorithms (MOEAs) and a posteriori selection. To this end, three well-known
MOEAs such as NSGA-II, SPEA-II and MOEA/D are thoroughly investigated to
determine if there exists any significant difference in their search
performance. The sensitivity of all these MOEAs to various qualitative and
quantitative parameters, such as the choice of recombination mechanism,
crossover and mutation probabilities, is also studied. These issues are
critically analyzed considering seven discrete-time and a continuous-time
benchmark nonlinear system as well as a practical case study of non-linear
wave-force modeling. The results of this investigation demonstrate that MOEAs
can be tailored to determine the correct structure of nonlinear systems.
Further, it has been established through frequency domain analysis that it is
possible to identify multiple valid discrete-time models for continuous-time
systems. A rigorous statistical analysis of MOEAs via performance sweet spots
in the parameter space convincingly demonstrates that these algorithms are
robust over a wide range of control parameters.

theory (PT). To quantify the redshift-space distortion effect, we focus mainly
on the monopole and quadrupole components of both the power and bispectra. We,
for the first time, compute the 5- and 6-point spectra to predict the
cross-covariance between the power and bispectra, and the auto-covariance of
the bispectrum in redshift space. We test the validity of our calculations by
comparing them with the covariance matrices measured from the MultiDark-Patchy
mock catalogues that are designed to reproduce the galaxy clustering measured
from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 12. We argue that
the simple, leading-order perturbation theory works because the shot-noise
corrections for the Patchy mocks are more dominant than other higher-order
terms we ignore. In the meantime, we confirm some discrepancies in the
comparison, especially of the cross-covariance. We discuss potential sources of
such discrepancies. We also show that our PT model reproduces well the
cumulative signal-to-noise of the power spectrum and the bispectrum as a

problems, and those problems are often very large in practice. For the case
where objective functions are monotone, many fast approximation algorithms have
been developed. The stochastic greedy algorithm (SG) is one such algorithm,
which is widely used thanks to its simplicity, efficiency, and high empirical
performance. However, its approximation guarantee has been proved only for
monotone objective functions. When it comes to non-monotone objective
functions, existing approximation algorithms are inefficient relative to the
fast algorithms developed for the case of monotone objectives. In this paper,
we prove that SG (with slight modification) can achieve almost
$1/4$-approximation guarantees in expectation in linear time even if objective
functions are non-monotone. Our result provides a constant-factor approximation
algorithm with the fewest oracle queries for non-monotone submodular
maximization with a cardinality constraint. Experiments validate the
performance of (modified) SG.

geometric and photometric compensation parts, and hence largely improves the
running time efficiency. Moreover, we construct the first setup-independent
full compensation benchmark to facilitate the study on this topic. In our

Lorenz model both analytically and numerically. The significant feature of the
model is the passage to chaos through a complete set of period-doubling
bifurcations above the Hopf point for inverse Schmidt numbers above a critical
value. Interestingly enough, at these Schmidt numbers a strange attractor and
stable fixed points coexist beyond the homoclinic point. At the Hopf point, the
strange attractor disappears leaving a high-period periodic orbit. This
periodic state becomes the expected limit cycle through a set of bifurcations
and then undergoes a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations leading to the
formation of a strange attractor. This is the first situation where a
Lorenz-like model has shown a set of consecutive period-doubling bifurcations

In 2017, we released the JSUT corpus, which contains 10 hours of reading-style
speech uttered by a single speaker, for end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis.
For more general use in speech synthesis research, e.g., voice conversion and
multi-speaker modeling, in this paper, we construct the JVS corpus, which
contains voice data of 100 speakers in three styles (normal, whisper, and
falsetto). The corpus contains 30 hours of voice data including 22 hours of
parallel normal voices. This paper describes how we designed the corpus and
summarizes the specifications. The corpus is available at our project page.

networks in the presence of general directed topologies that are represented by
signed digraphs. A new class of improved Laplacian potential functions is
proposed by presenting two notions of any signed digraph: induced unsigned
digraph and mirror (undirected) signed graph, based on which two distributed
averaging protocols are designed using the nearest neighbor rules. It is shown
that with any of the designed protocols, signed-average consensus
(respectively, state stability) can be achieved if and only if the associated
signed digraph of signed network is structurally balanced (respectively,
unbalanced), regardless of whether weight balance is satisfied or not. Further,
improved Laplacian potential functions can be exploited to solve fixed-time
consensus problems of signed networks with directed topologies, in which a
nonlinear distributed protocol is proposed to ensure the bipartite consensus or
state stability within a fixed time. Additionally, the convergence analyses of
directed signed networks can be implemented with the Lyapunov stability
analysis method, which is realized by revealing the tight relationship between
convergence behaviors of directed signed networks and properties of improved
Laplacian potential functions. Illustrative examples are presented to
demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results for directed signed
networks.

reductive Lie algebra. We first show that there are only two proper parabolic

representation theory reduces the question to the study of the ``minimal

existence of projective covers of simple objects in these categories, which
enables us to establish a satisfactory block theory. Most notably, our main
results are as follows:
  (1) We classify and obtain a precise description of the blocks of $\comi$.
  (2) We investigate indecomposable tilting and indecomposable projective

is a generic property and that it is necessary for the occurrence of phase
singularity and wavefront dislocation, while these phenomena are generic too.

approximation to divide all nodes into two disjoint sets, which are optimized
alternately until convergence. For each node set, to promote piecewise smooth

approach for simulating quasi-brittle fracture, named Global Cracking Elements
Method (GCEM). For this purpose the formulation of the original CEM is
reorganized. The new approach is embedded in the standard framework of the
Galerkin-based Finite Element Method (FEM), which uses disconnected
element-wise crack openings for capturing crack initiation and propagation. The
similarity between the proposed Global Cracking Elements (GCE) and the standard
9-node quadrilateral element (Q9) suggests a special procedure: the degrees of
freedom of the center node of the Q9, originally defining the displacements,
are ""borrowed"" to describe the crack openings of the GCE. The proposed approach
does not need remeshing, enrichment, or a crack-tracking strategy, and it
avoids a precise description of the crack tip. Several benchmark tests provide
evidence that the new approach inherits from the CEM most of the advantages.
The numerical stability and robustness of the GCEM are better than the ones of
the CEM. However, presently only quadrilateral elements with nonlinear
interpolations of the displacement field can be used.

  Lov\'asz Local Lemma","appeared at PODC 19",,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma (LLL) says that, given a set of bad events that
depend on the values of some random variables and where each event happens with
probability at most $p$ and depends on at most $d$ other events, there is an
assignment of the variables that avoids all bad events if the LLL criterion
$ep(d+1)<1$ is satisfied.
  In this paper, we study the dependency of the distributed complexity of the
LLL problem on the chosen LLL criterion. We show that for the fundamental case
of each random variable of the considered LLL instance being associated with an
edge of the input graph, that is, each random variable influences at most two
events, a sharp threshold phenomenon occurs at $p = 2^{-d}$: we provide a
simple deterministic (!) algorithm that matches a known $\Omega(\log^* n)$
lower bound in bounded degree graphs, if $p < 2^{-d}$, whereas for $p \geq
2^{-d}$, a known $\Omega(\log \log n)$ randomized and a known $\Omega(\log n)$
deterministic lower bounds hold.
  In many applications variables affect more than two events; our main
contribution is to extend our algorithm to the case where random variables
influence at most three different bad events. We show that, surprisingly, the
sharp threshold occurs at the exact same spot, providing evidence for our
conjecture that this phenomenon always occurs at $p = 2^{-d}$, independent of
the number $r$ of events that are affected by a variable. Almost all steps of
the proof framework we provide for the case $r=3$ extend directly to the case
of arbitrary $r$; consequently, our approach serves as a step towards
characterizing the complexity of the LLL under different exponential criteria.

Confinement Fusion (ICF), which is usually done by solving a view-factor
equation model. The model is nonlinear, and the number of equations can be very
large when the size of discrete mesh element is very small to achieve a
prescribed accuracy, which may lead to an intensive equation solving process.
In this paper, an efficient radiation symmetry analysis approach based on
sparse representation is presented, in which, 1) the Spherical harmonics,
annular Zernike polynomials and Legendre-Fourier polynomials are employed to
sparsely represent the radiation flux on the capsule and cylindrical cavity,
and the nonlinear energy equilibrium equations are transformed into the
equations with sparse coefficients, which means there are many redundant
equations, 2) only a few equations are selected to recover such sparse
coefficients with Latin hypercube sampling, 3) a Conjugate Gradient Subspace
Thresholding Pursuit (CGSTP) algorithm is then given to rapidly obtain such
sparse coefficients equation with as few iterations as possible. Finally, the
proposed method is validated with two experiment targets for Shenguang II and
Shenguang III laser facility in China. The results show that only one tenth of
computation time is required to solve one tenth of equations to achieve the
radiation flux with comparable accuracy. Further more, the solution is much
more efficient as the size of discrete mesh element decreases, in which, only
1.2\% computation time is required to obtain the accurate result.

equipments (UEs), e.g., smart phones, tablets, or vehicles, as well as the
increasing concerns about sharing private data, a new machine learning model
has emerged, namely federated learning (FL), that allows a decoupling of data
acquisition and computation at the central unit. Unlike centralized learning
taking place in a data center, FL usually operates in a wireless edge network
where the communication medium is resource-constrained and unreliable. Due to
limited bandwidth, only a portion of UEs can be scheduled for updates at each
iteration. Due to the shared nature of the wireless medium, transmissions are
subjected to interference and are not guaranteed. The performance of FL system
in such a setting is not well understood. In this paper, an analytical model is
developed to characterize the performance of FL in wireless networks.
Particularly, tractable expressions are derived for the convergence rate of FL
in a wireless setting, accounting for effects from both scheduling schemes and
inter-cell interference. Using the developed analysis, the effectiveness of
three different scheduling policies, i.e., random scheduling (RS), round robin
(RR), and proportional fair (PF), are compared in terms of FL convergence rate.
It is shown that running FL with PF outperforms RS and RR if the network is
operating under a high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
threshold, while RR is more preferable when the SINR threshold is low.
Moreover, the FL convergence rate decreases rapidly as the SINR threshold
increases, thus confirming the importance of compression and quantization of
the update parameters. The analysis also reveals a trade-off between the number

the face recognition research in the past years. However, existing general CNN
face models generalize poorly to the scenario of occlusions on variable facial
areas. Inspired by the fact that a human visual system explicitly ignores
occlusions and only focuses on non-occluded facial areas, we propose a mask
learning strategy to find and discard the corrupted feature elements for face
recognition. A mask dictionary is firstly established by exploiting the
differences between the top convoluted features of occluded and occlusion-free
face pairs using an innovatively designed Pairwise Differential Siamese Network
(PDSN). Each item of this dictionary captures the correspondence between
occluded facial areas and corrupted feature elements, which is named Feature
Discarding Mask (FDM). When dealing with a face image with random partial
occlusions, we generate its FDM by combining relevant dictionary items and then
multiply it with the original features to eliminate those corrupted feature
elements. Comprehensive experiments on both synthesized and realistic occluded
face datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the

(35\% iron and 65\% rock), but two planets (K2-141b and K2-229b) show evidence

spectral retrieval analyses for a host of atmospheric scenarios. Our approach
is both analytical and numerical: we first use simple approximations to extract
analytically the influence of each parameter to the wavelength-dependent
transit depth. We then adopt a fully Bayesian retrieval model to quantify the
propagation of the mass uncertainty onto other atmospheric parameters. We found
that for clear-sky, gaseous atmospheres the posterior distributions are the
same when the mass is known or retrieved. The retrieved mass is very accurate,
with a precision of more than 10%, provided the wavelength coverage and S/N are
adequate. When opaque clouds are included in the simulations, the uncertainties
in the retrieved mass increase, especially for high altitude clouds. However
atmospheric parameters such as the temperature and trace-gas abundances are
unaffected by the knowledge of the mass. Secondary atmospheres are more
challenging due to the higher degree of freedom for the atmospheric main
component, which is unknown. For broad wavelength range and adequate SNR, the
mass can still be retrieved accurately and precisely if clouds are not present,
and so are all the other atmospheric/planetary parameters. When clouds are
added, we find that the mass uncertainties may impact substantially the
retrieval of the mean molecular weight: an independent characterisation of the
mass would therefore be helpful to capture/confirm the main atmospheric
constituent.

however, the manually initialized filtering kernel hampers its adaptivity
across images with various characteristics. To deal with image variation (i.e.,
non-stationary noise), in this paper, we propose multi-kernel filter (MKF)
which adapts filtering kernels to specific image characteristics automatically.
The design of MKF takes inspiration from adaptive mechanisms of human vision
that make full use of information in a visual context. More specifically, for
simulating the visual context and its adaptive function, we construct the image
context based on which we simulate the contextual impact on filtering kernels.
We first design a hierarchically clustering algorithm to generate a hierarchy
of large to small coherent image patches, organized as a cluster tree, so that
obtain multi-scale image representation. The leaf cluster and corresponding
predecessor clusters are used to generate one of multiple range kernels that
are capable of catering to image variation. At first, we design a

is used to generate one of the multiple kernels, and two corresponding
predecessor clusters are used to fine-tune the adopted kernel. Ultimately, the
single spatially-invariant kernel in BF becomes multiple spatially-varying
ones. We evaluate MKF on two public datasets, BSD300 and BrainWeb which are

Extensive experiments show that MKF outperforms state-of-the-art filters w.r.t.

However, we can also formulate error detection as a semi-supervised

such an approach are twofold: (1) to represent the data in a way that enables a
classification model to identify various kinds of data errors, and (2) to pick
the most promising data values for learning. In this paper, we address these

principles of multi-view geometry. For integrating single-view depth in a
statistical manner, a convolutional neural network, called ProbDepthNet, is
proposed. ProbDepthNet estimates pixel-wise depth distributions from a single

novel recalibration technique for regression problems is proposed to ensure
well-calibrated distributions. Our experiments show that Mono-SF outperforms
state-of-the-art monocular baselines and ablation studies support the Mono-SF

""virtually heal"" anyone by turning his medical image, with an unknown health
status (diseased or healthy), into a healthy one, so that diseased regions

to identify a minimal subset of target pixels for domain translation, an
ability that we call fixed-point translation, which no GAN is equipped with
yet. Therefore, we propose a new GAN, called Fixed-Point GAN, trained by (1)
supervising same-domain translation through a conditional identity loss, and
(2) regularizing cross-domain translation through revised adversarial, domain
classification, and cycle consistency loss. Based on fixed-point translation,
we further derive a novel framework for disease detection and localization

demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art in

Thus, the model is referred to as the corded directed-node-duplication (DND)
model. In this network not all pairs of nodes are connected by directed paths,
in spite of the fact that the corresponding undirected network consists of a
single connected component. More specifically, in the large network limit only
a diminishing fraction of pairs of nodes are connected by directed paths. To
calculate the DSPL between those pairs of nodes that are connected by directed
paths we derive a master equation for the time evolution of the probability
$P_t(L=\ell)$, $\ell=1,2,\dots$, where $\ell$ is the length of the shortest
directed path. Solving the master equation, we obtain a closed form expression
for $P_t(L=\ell)$. It is found that the DSPL at time $t$ consists of a
convolution of the initial DSPL $P_0(L=\ell)$, with a Poisson distribution and
a sum of Poisson distributions. The mean distance ${\mathbb E}_t[L|L<\infty]$
between pairs of nodes which are connected by directed paths is found to depend
logarithmically on the network size $N_t$. However, since in the large network
limit the fraction of pairs of nodes that are connected by directed paths is
diminishingly small, the corded DND network is not a small-world network,
unlike the corresponding undirected network.

completely describe all possible tensor decompositions of a given group von

Different known attacks on block ciphers have resulted in diverse cryptographic
criteria for vectorial Boolean functions, such as differential uniformity and
nonlinearity. Very recently, Bar-On et al. introduced at Eurocrypt'19 a new
tool, called the differential-linear connectivity table (DLCT), which allows
for taking into account the dependency between the two subciphers $E_0$ and
$E_1$ involved in differential-linear attacks. This new notion leads to
significant improvements of differential-linear attacks on several ciphers.
This paper presents a theoretical characterization of the DLCT of vectorial
Boolean functions and also investigates this new criterion for some families of
functions with specific forms.
  More precisely, we firstly reveal the connection between the DLCT and the
autocorrelation of vectorial Boolean functions, we characterize properties of
the DLCT by means of the Walsh transform of the function and of its
differential distribution table, and we present generic bounds on the highest
magnitude occurring in the DLCT of vectorial Boolean functions, which coincides
(up to a factor~\(2\)) with the well-established notion of absolute indicator.
Next, we investigate the invariance property of the DLCT of vectorial Boolean
functions under the affine, extended-affine, and Carlet-Charpin-Zinoviev (CCZ)
equivalence and exhaust the DLCT spectra of optimal $4$-bit S-boxes under
affine equivalence. Furthermore, we study the DLCT of APN, plateaued and AB
functions and establish its connection with other cryptographic criteria.
Finally, we investigate the DLCT and the absolute indicator of some specific
polynomials with optimal or low differential uniformity, including monomials,
cubic functions, quadratic functions and inverses of quadratic permutations.

build new high-level features from the original ones. Among these techniques,
Genetic Programming is a good candidate to provide interpretable features

many real-world problems. However, training a deep neural network is very
time-consuming, especially on big data. It has become difficult for a single
machine to train a large model over large datasets. A popular solution is to
distribute and parallelize the training process across multiple machines using
the parameter server framework. In this paper, we present a distributed
paradigm on the parameter server framework called Dynamic Stale Synchronous
Parallel (DSSP) which improves the state-of-the-art Stale Synchronous Parallel
(SSP) paradigm by dynamically determining the staleness threshold at the run
time. Conventionally to run distributed training in SSP, the user needs to
specify a particular staleness threshold as a hyper-parameter. However, a user
does not usually know how to set the threshold and thus often finds a threshold
value through trial and error, which is time-consuming. Based on workers'
recent processing time, our approach DSSP adaptively adjusts the threshold per
iteration at running time to reduce the waiting time of faster workers for
synchronization of the globally shared parameters, and consequently increases
the frequency of parameters updates (increases iteration throughput), which
speedups the convergence rate. We compare DSSP with other paradigms such as
Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP), Asynchronous Parallel (ASP), and SSP by
running deep neural networks (DNN) models over GPU clusters in both homogeneous
and heterogeneous environments. The results show that in a heterogeneous
environment where the cluster consists of mixed models of GPUs, DSSP converges
to a higher accuracy much earlier than SSP and BSP and performs similarly to
ASP. In a homogeneous distributed cluster, DSSP has more stable and slightly
better performance than SSP and ASP, and converges much faster than BSP.

  machine learning based on small dataset",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Establishing the structure-property relationship for grain boundaries (GBs)
is critical for developing next generation functional materials, but has been
severely hampered due to its extremely large configurational space. Atomistic
simulations with low computational cost and high predictive power are strongly
desirable, but the conventional simulations using empirical interatomic
potentials and density functional theory suffer from the lack of predictive
power and high computational cost, respectively. A machine learning interatomic
potential (MLIP) recently emerged but often requires an extensive size of the
training dataset, making it a less feasible approach. Here we demonstrate that
an MLIP trained with a rationally designed small training dataset can predict
thermal transport across GBs in graphene with ab initio accuracy at an
affordable computational cost. In particular, we employed a rational approach
based on the structural unit model to find a small set of GBs that can
represent the entire configurational space and thus can serve as a
cost-effective training dataset for the MLIP. Only 5 GBs were found to be
enough to represent the entire configurational space of graphene GBs. Using the
atomistic Green's function approach and the MLIP, we revealed that the
structure-thermal resistance relation in graphene does not follow the common
understanding that large dislocation density causes larger thermal resistance.
In fact, thermal resistance is nearly independent of dislocation density at
room temperature and is higher when the dislocation density is small at
sub-room temperature. We explain this intriguing behavior with the buckling
near a GB causing a strong scattering of flexural phonon modes.

electromagnetic absorption in a photoresist layer with one face in contact with
a quartz binary phase-shift mask. The broadband ultraviolet illumination is
represented as a frequency-spectrum of normally incident plane waves. A
rigorous coupled-wave analysis is carried out to determine the absorption
spectrum of the photoresist layer. The specific absorption rate in the
photoresist layer is calculated and examined in relation to the geometric
parameters. Columnar features in the photoresist layer are of higher quality on
broadband illumination in contrast to monochromatic illumination, in conformity
with some recent experimental results. Feature resolution and profile are
noticeably affected by the depth of the grooves in the phase-shift mask.
Ideally, the feature linewidth can be less than about 100 nm for broadband
illumination in the transverse-magnetic mode. These conclusions are subject to
modification by the photochemistry-wavelength characteristics of the
photoresist.
