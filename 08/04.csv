censorship conjecture (WCCC) for linear order accretion while the same is
always restored back for non-linear accretion. The only exception however is
that of a five dimensional rotating black hole with single rotation that cannot
be overspun even at linear order. In this paper we investigate this question
for a five dimensional charged rotating minimally gauged supergravity black
hole and show that it could not be overspun under non-linear accretion and
thereby respecting WCCC. However in the case of single rotation WCCC is however
also respected for linear accretion when angular momentum of accreting particle
is greater than its charge irrespective of relative dominance of charge and
rotation parameters of black hole.

complex phase diagrams in terms of the Sr-doping and their sensitivity to
intrinsic and extrinsic structural deformations. Here, we performed x-ray
absorption spectroscopy measurements of manganites bilayers to explore the
effects that a local Sr-doping gradient produce on the charge and
antiferromagnetic anisotropies. In order to gradually tune the Sr-doping level
along the axis perpendicular to the samples we have grown a series of bilayers
with different thicknesses of low-doped manganites (from 0 nm to 6 nm)
deposited over a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 metallic layer. This strategy permitted us to
resolve with high accuracy the thickness region where the charge and spin
anisotropies vary and the critical thickness tc over which the out of plane
orbital asymmetry does not have any further modifications. We found that the
antiferromagnetic spin axis points preferentially out of the sample plane
regardless the capping layer thickness. However, it tilts partially into the
sample plane far from this critical thickness, owing to the jointed
contributions of the external structural strain and electron doping.
Furthermore, we found that the doping level of the capping layer sensibly
affects the critical thickness, giving clear evidence of the influence exerted
by the electron doping on the orbital and magnetic configurations. These
anisotropy changes induce subtle modifications on the domain reorientation of
the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, as evidenced from the magnetic hysteresis cycles.

which are known at all of the servers. Using the combination of those basic
functions, it is possible to construct a wide class of functions. The user
wishes to compute a particular combination of the basic functions, by
offloading the computation to $N$ servers, while the servers should not obtain
any information about which combination of the basic functions is to be
computed. The objective is to minimize the total number of queries asked by the
user from the servers to achieve the desired result.
  As a first step toward this problem, in this paper, we consider the case
where the user is interested in a class of functions which are composition of
the basic functions, while each basic function appears in the composition
exactly once. This means that in this case, to ensure privacy, we only require
to hide to the order of the basic functions in the desired composition of the
user. We further assume that the basic functions are linear and can be
represented by (possibly large-scale) matrices. We call this problem as private
sequential function computation. We study the capacity $C$, defined as the
supremum of the number of desired computations, normalized by the number of
computations done at the servers, subject to the privacy constraint. We prove
that $(1-\frac{1}{N})/ (1-\frac{1}{\max(K,N)}) \le C \le 1$. For the
achievability, we show that the user can retrieve the desired order of
composition, by choosing a proper order of inquiries among different servers,
while keeping the order of computations for each server fixed, irrespective of
the desired order of composition. In the end, we develop an
information-theoretic converse which results in an upper bound on the capacity.

in domains such as e-commerce, social networking, and education. Representation
learning presents an attractive opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of

its evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space. However,
existing dynamic embedding methods generate embeddings only when users take
actions and do not explicitly model the future trajectory of the user/item in
the embedding space. Here we propose JODIE, a coupled recurrent neural network
model that learns the embedding trajectories of users and items. JODIE employs
two recurrent neural networks to update the embedding of a user and an item at
every interaction. Crucially, JODIE also models the future embedding trajectory
of a user/item. To this end, it introduces a novel projection operator that
learns to estimate the embedding of the user at any time in the future. These
estimated embeddings are then used to predict future user-item interactions. To
make the method scalable, we develop a t-Batch algorithm that creates
time-consistent batches and leads to 9x faster training. We conduct six
experiments to validate JODIE on two prediction tasks---future interaction
prediction and state change prediction---using four real-world datasets. We
show that JODIE outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms in these tasks by
at least 20% in predicting future interactions and 12% in state change

in their dissipative nature, which was not fully considered before. Heat

challenging due to the intricate interaction between features, non-homogeneity
of alerts, and potential for rare yet critical samples. Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) have been shown to effectively learn complex data distributions
with the intent of creating increasingly realistic data. This paper presents
the application of GANs to cyber-attack alert data and shows that GANs not only
successfully learn to generate realistic alerts, but also reveal feature
dependencies within alerts. This is accomplished by reviewing the intersection
of histograms for varying alert-feature combinations between the ground truth
and generated datsets. Traditional statistical metrics, such as conditional and
joint entropy, are also employed to verify the accuracy of these dependencies.
Finally, it is shown that a Mutual Information constraint on the network can be
used to increase the generation of low probability, critical, alert values. By
mapping alerts to a set of attack stages it is shown that the output of these
low probability alerts has a direct contextual meaning for Cyber Security
analysts. Overall, this work provides the basis for generating new cyber
intrusion alerts and provides evidence that synthesized alerts emulate critical
dependencies from the source dataset.

dents or spikes of varying roundness. These features exhibit individual
spontaneous wetting behaviors comprising pinned contact lines, rivulets or
cusps. If occurring in proximity to one another, as is often the case in
applications, these wetting properties interact, resulting in an overall
changed wetting pattern on the surface. Hence, there is considerable interest
in understanding when, and to what extent, interactions occur, and how wetting
then deviates from the wetting of isolated surface features. The present study
addresses these questions by experimentally and theoretically studying the
capillary interaction of sharp-edged 90{\deg} (outer) and 270{\deg} (inner)
corners in proximity to one another. It is shown that the spontaneous wetting
at the convex outer corner is in uenced by the concave inner corner even when
they are separated by a distance of several times the capillary length, while
the wetting of the inner corner takes place unaffected by the outer corner,
except when the separating distance is much smaller than the capillary length.
The final contact line shape at the inner corner is measured and theoretically
modelled for contact angles up to 90{\deg}.

destabilize the electroweak scale and require an ad-hoc counterterm cancelling
the large loop contribution. If the mass scale m1 of these new particles in in
the TeV range, this feature constitutes the ""little fine-tuning problem"". We
consider the case that the new-physics spectrum has a little hierarchy with two
particle mass scales m1, m2 and m2 = O(10 m1) and no tree-level couplings of
the heavier particles to Higgs doublets. As a concrete example we study the
(next-to-)minimal supersymmetric standard model ((N)MSSM) for the case that the
gluino mass M3 is significantly larger than the stop mass parameters m_{L,R}
and show that the usual one-loop fine-tuning analysis breaks down. If m_{L,R}
is defined in the dimensional-reduction (DR-bar) or any other fundamental
scheme, corrections enhanced by powers of M3^2/m_{L,R}^2 occur in all higher
loop orders. After resumming these terms we find the fine-tuning measure
substantially improved compared to the usual analyses with M3 <~ m_{L,R}. In
our hierarchical scenario the stop self-energies grow like M3^2, so that the
stop masses m_{L,R}^{OS} in the on-shell (OS) scheme are naturally much larger
than their DR-bar counterparts m_{L,R}^{DR-bar}. This feature permits a novel
solution to the little fine-tuning problem: DR-bar stop masses are close to the
electroweak scale, but radiative corrections involving the heavy gluino push
the OS masses, which are probed in collider searches, above their experimental
lower limits. As a byproduct, we clarify which renormalization scheme must be
used for squark masses in loop corrections to low-energy quantities such as the
B-B-bar mixing amplitude.

the two branes in the extra dimension. For distances, which are larger than
this new length scale, we recover the original DGP result, but for smaller

where a 4-dimensional observer measures a distance independent force. We
discuss a possible application of the present scenario for deriving rotation

traditional Monte Carlo methods which require repeatedly solving PDEs are
infeasible. Alternative approaches which are typically the surrogate based
methods suffer from the so-called ``curse of dimensionality'', which limits
their application to problems with high-dimensional parameters. For this

applications. However, modern LiDAR sensors only provide sparse depth
measurement. It is thus necessary to complete the sparse LiDAR data, where a
synchronized guidance RGB image is often used to facilitate this completion.
Many neural networks have been designed for this task. However, they often
na\""{\i}vely fuse the LiDAR data and RGB image information by performing
feature concatenation or element-wise addition. Inspired by the guided image
filtering, we design a novel guided network to predict kernel weights from the
guidance image. These predicted kernels are then applied to extract the depth
image features. In this way, our network generates content-dependent and
spatially-variant kernels for multi-modal feature fusion. Dynamically generated
spatially-variant kernels could lead to prohibitive GPU memory consumption and
computation overhead. We further design a convolution factorization to reduce
computation and memory consumption. The GPU memory reduction makes it possible
for feature fusion to work in multi-stage scheme. We conduct comprehensive
experiments to verify our method on real-world outdoor, indoor and synthetic
datasets. Our method produces strong results. It outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on the NYUv2 dataset and ranks 1st on the KITTI depth completion

equation to those obtained from a Lindblad master equation which only includes
number-conserving terms (i.e. Kerr interactions) shows that number
non-conserving terms can lead to significant drive-power dependence of the

introduce a similarity based collaborative filtering algorithm for estimating a
tensor from sparse observations and argue that it achieves sample complexity
that nearly matches the conjectured computationally efficient lower bound on
the sample complexity for the setting of low-rank tensors. Our algorithm uses
the matrix obtained from the flattened tensor to compute similarity, and
estimates the tensor entries using a nearest neighbor estimator. We prove that
the algorithm recovers a finite rank tensor with maximum entry-wise error (MEE)
and mean-squared-error (MSE) decaying to $0$ as long as each entry is observed
independently with probability $p = \Omega(n^{-3/2 + \kappa})$ for any
arbitrarily small $\kappa > 0$. More generally, we establish robustness of the
estimator, showing that when arbitrary noise bounded by $\varepsilon \geq 0$ is
added to each observation, the estimation error with respect to MEE and MSE
degrades by $\text{poly}(\varepsilon)$. Consequently, even if the tensor may
not have finite rank but can be approximated within $\varepsilon \geq 0$ by a
finite rank tensor, then the estimation error converges to
$\text{poly}(\varepsilon)$. Our analysis sheds insight into the conjectured
sample complexity lower bound, showing that it matches the connectivity
threshold of the graph used by our algorithm for estimating similarity between

extensively, with a focus on the ignorable missing case, where the missing
probability depends only on observable quantities. By contrast, research into
non-ignorable missing data problems is quite limited. The main difficulty in
solving such problems is that the missing probability and the regression
likelihood function are tangled together in the likelihood presentation, and
the model parameters may not be identifiable even under strong parametric model
assumptions. In this paper we discuss a semiparametric model for non-ignorable
missing data and propose a maximum full semiparametric likelihood estimation
method, which is an efficient combination of the parametric conditional
likelihood and the marginal nonparametric biased sampling likelihood. The extra
marginal likelihood contribution can not only produce efficiency gain but also
identify the underlying model parameters without additional assumptions. We
further show that the proposed estimators for the underlying parameters and the
response mean are semiparametrically efficient. Extensive simulations and a
real data analysis demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over

Fuzzing technology is widely used as a vulnerability discovery technology to

technology has been introduced as a new method into fuzzing test to alleviate
these challenges. This paper reviews the research progress of using machine
learning technology for fuzzing test in recent years, analyzes how machine

techniques can be used for fuzzing scenarios and identifies six different
stages in which machine learning have been used. Then this paper systematically
study the machine learning based fuzzing models from selection of machine
learning algorithm, pre-processing methods, datasets, evaluation metrics, and

machine learning models based on the frequently used evaluation metrics. The
results of the evaluation prove that machine learning technology has an

also able to move a DW via synchronization between the DW angle and the phase
of the AC bias. The resulting DW velocity is proportional to the driving
frequency of the AC bias, but independent of the bias strength, offering
potentially low-power operations of DW devices. The AC-bias-driven DW motion is
shown to exhibit a phase locking-unlocking transition, a critical phenomenon
akin to the Walker breakdown of a DC-bias-driven DW motion. Our work shows that
a DW can be driven resonantly by synchronizing its angle to AC biases, shedding

Frobenius-norm based latent low-rank representation model, rBDLR jointly learns
the coding coefficients and salient features, and improves the results by
enhancing the robustness to outliers and errors in given data, preserving local
information of salient features adaptively and ensuring the block-diagonal
structures of the coefficients. To improve the robustness, we perform the
latent representation and adaptive weighting in a recovered clean data space.
To force the coefficients to be block-diagonal, we perform auto-weighting by
minimizing the reconstruction error based on salient features, constrained
using a block-diagonal regularizer. This ensures that a strict block-diagonal
weight matrix can be obtained and salient features will possess the adaptive
locality preserving ability. By minimizing the difference between the
coefficient and weights matrices, we can obtain a block-diagonal coefficients
matrix and it can also propagate and exchange useful information between
salient features and coefficients. Extensive results demonstrate the
superiority of rBDLR over other state-of-the-art methods.

information-theoretically secure keys between two distant users. In practice,
with a careful characterization of quantum sources and the decoy-state method,
measure-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) provides secure
key distribution. While short-distance fibre-based QKD has already been
available for real-life implementation, the bottleneck of practical QKD lies on
the limited transmission distance. Due to photon losses in transmission, it was
believed that the key generation rate is bounded by a linear function of the
channel transmittance, $O(\eta)$, without a quantum repeater, which puts an
upper bound on the maximal secure transmission distance. Interestingly, a new
phase-encoding MDI-QKD scheme, named twin-field QKD, has been suggested to beat
the linear bound, while another variant, named phase-matching quantum key
distribution (PM-QKD), has been proven to have a quadratic key-rate
improvement, $O(\sqrt{\eta})$. In reality, however, the intrinsic optical mode
mismatch of independent lasers, accompanied by phase fluctuation and drift,
impedes the successful experimental implementation of the new schemes. Here, we
solve this problem with the assistance of the laser injection technique and the
phase post-compensation method. In the experiment, the key rate surpasses the
linear key-rate bound via 302 km and 402 km commercial-fibre channels,
achieving a key rate over 4 orders of magnitude higher than the existing
results in literature. Furthermore, with a 502 km ultralow-loss fibre, our
system yields a secret key rate of 0.118 bps. We expect this new type of QKD
schemes to become a new standard for future QKD.

D-Softmax as objective, we can have a clear understanding of both the intra-

reduce the computation cost. Training with regular-scale data, experiments in
face verification show D-Softmax is favorably comparable to existing losses

show the fast variants of D-Softmax significantly accelerates the training

properties is predicted by systematic first-principles calculations. These
fascinating carbon allotropes can be derived by inserting acetylenic linkages
(-C$\equiv$C-) into graphite, hence they are termed as grapheaynes. Grapheaynes
possess two different space groups, $P$2/$m$ or $C$2/$m$, and contain
simultaneously the $sp$, $sp^2$, and $sp^3$ chemical bonds. They have formation
energies lower than the already experimentally synthesized graphdiyne and other
theoretically predicted carbon allotropes with acetylenic linkages.
Particularly, when the width $n$ of grapheayne-$n$ exceeds 15, its cohesive
energy is lower than that of diamond, and approaches that of graphite with
increasing $n$. Remarkably, we find that some grapheaynes behave as
semiconductors with direct narrow band gaps and own the highest absorption
coefficients among all known semiconducting carbon allotropes, while some
others are topological semimetals with nodal lines. Especially, some
grapheaynes can be engineered with tunable direct band gaps in the range of
1.07-1.87 eV and have ideal properties for photovoltaic applications. Our work

on a single source of information, while using information from multiple

used, but the techniques are often unable to deal with skewness in the data.
Hence, we propose a new ML approach for predicting DDIs based on multiple data

randomly over the network. We induce solitary states in the originally
synchronized network of identical nodes by introducing delays in the links for
a certain number of selected network elements. It is shown that the extent of
displacement and the position of solitary elements can be completely controlled
by the choice (values) and positions (locations) of the incorporated delays,
reshaping the delay engineered solitary states in the network.

determined by its sparse baseline coverage. In particular, EHT coverage is
dominated by long baselines, and is highly sensitive to atmospheric conditions
and loss of sites between experiments. The limited short/mid-range baselines
especially affect the imaging process, hindering the recovery of more extended
features in the image. We present an algorithmic contingency for the absence of
well-constrained short baselines in the imaging of compact sources, such as the
supermassive black holes observed with the EHT. This technique enforces a
specific second moment on the reconstructed image in the form of a size
constraint, which corresponds to the curvature of the measured visibility
function at zero baseline. The method enables the recovery of information lost
in gaps of the baseline coverage on short baselines and enables corrections of
any systematic amplitude offsets for the stations giving short-baseline
measurements present in the observation. The regularization can use historical
source size measurements to constrain the second moment of the reconstructed
image to match the observed size. We additionally show that a characteristic
size can be derived from available short-baseline measurements, extrapolated
from other wavelengths, or estimated without complementary size constraints
with parameter searches. We demonstrate the capabilities of this method for
both static and movie reconstructions of variable sources.

area, the robustness of graph embedding against adversarial attack inevitably
becomes a central problem in graph learning domain. Regardless of the fruitful
progress, most of the current works perform the attack in a white-box fashion:
they need to access the model predictions and labels to construct their
adversarial loss. However, the inaccessibility of model predictions in real
systems makes the white-box attack impractical to real graph learning system.
This paper promotes current frameworks in a more general and flexible sense --
we demand to attack various kinds of graph embedding model with black-box
driven. To this end, we begin by investigating the theoretical connections
between graph signal processing and graph embedding models in a principled way
and formulate the graph embedding model as a general graph signal process with
corresponding graph filter. As such, a generalized adversarial attacker:
GF-Attack is constructed by the graph filter and feature matrix. Instead of
accessing any knowledge of the target classifiers used in graph embedding,
GF-Attack performs the attack only on the graph filter in a black-box attack
fashion. To validate the generalization of GF-Attack, we construct the attacker
on four popular graph embedding models. Extensive experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our attacker on several benchmark datasets. Particularly
by using our attack, even small graph perturbations like one-edge flip is able
to consistently make a strong attack in performance to different graph
embedding models.

generated at the source and its \emph{in-order delivery} to the application

problem can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP), and hence the optimal code construction can be obtained by solving the
corresponding POMDP. However, solving the POMDP optimally is in general
difficult unless the size is very small. To this end, we propose an efficient
heuristic algorithm, namely the majority vote policy, for obtaining a high
quality approximate solution. We also derive the tight lower and upper bounds
of the optimal state values of this POMDP, based on which a more sophisticated
D-step search algorithm is implemented for obtaining near-optimal solutions.
The simulation results show that the proposed code designs via solving the

layers, and the general lack of provable equivariance guarantees. We present a
variation of capsule networks that aims to remedy this. We identify that
learning all pair-wise part-whole relationships between capsules of successive

networks and the routing mechanism are both key to equivariance. Based on
these, we propose an alternative framework for capsule networks that learns to
projectively encode the manifold of pose-variations, termed the
space-of-variation (SOV), for every capsule-type of each layer. This is done
using a trainable, equivariant function defined over a grid of
group-transformations. Thus, the prediction-phase of routing involves
projection into the SOV of a deeper capsule using the corresponding function.
As a specific instantiation of this idea, and also in order to reap the
benefits of increased parameter-sharing, we use type-homogeneous
group-equivariant convolutions of shallower capsules in this phase. We also
introduce an equivariant routing mechanism based on degree-centrality. We show
that this particular instance of our general model is equivariant, and hence
preserves the compositional representation of an input under transformations.

different directions. In this paper, inspired by multi-view stereo (MVS), we
propose an Adversarial View-Consistent Learning (AVCL) framework to force the
estimated depth map to be all reasonable viewed from multiple views. To this
end, we first design a differentiable depth map warping operation, which is
end-to-end trainable, and then propose a pose generator to generate novel views
for a given image in an adversarial manner. Collaborating with the
differentiable depth map warping operation, the pose generator encourages the
depth estimation network to learn from hard views, hence produce
view-consistent depth maps . We evaluate our method on NYU Depth V2 dataset and

quenched to ambient condition; and finally, the single-layer T-graphene can be
either exfoliated using the electrochemical method from the bulk C4K, or peeled
off from bulk T-graphite C4, where C4 can be obtained from C4K by evaporating
the K atoms. Interestingly, we find that the calculated Tc of C4K is about
30.4K at 0GPa, which sets a new record for layered carbon-based

Padding turns inputs into the same size. RoM pooling pools image features and
discards extra padded features to eliminate the side effects of padding. In
addition, the image aspect ratios are encoded and fused with visual features to
remedy the shape information loss of RoM pooling. Furthermore, we observe that
the same image may receive different aesthetic evaluations under different
themes, which we call theme criterion bias. Hence, a theme-aware model that
uses theme information to guide model predictions is proposed. Finally, we
design an attention-based feature fusion module to effectively utilize both the

A major goal is the atmospheric characterization of dozens of small,
terrestrial exoplanets in order to search for signatures in their atmospheres
that indicate biological activity, assess their ability to provide conditions
for life as we know it, and investigate their expected atmospheric diversity.
None of the currently adopted projects or missions, from ground or in space,
can address these goals. In this White Paper we argue that a large space-based
mission designed to detect and investigate thermal emission spectra of
terrestrial exoplanets in the MIR wavelength range provides unique scientific
potential to address these goals and surpasses the capabilities of other
approaches. While NASA might be focusing on large missions that aim to detect
terrestrial planets in reflected light, ESA has the opportunity to take
leadership and spearhead the development of a large MIR exoplanet mission
within the scope of the ""Voyage 2050"" long-term plan establishing Europe at the
forefront of exoplanet science for decades to come. Given the ambitious science
goals of such a mission, additional international partners might be interested
in participating and contributing to a roadmap that, in the long run, leads to
a successful implementation. A new, dedicated development program funded by ESA
to help reduce development and implementation cost and further push some of the
required key technologies would be a first important step in this direction.
Ultimately, a large MIR exoplanet imaging mission will be needed to help answer
one of mankind's most fundamental questions: ""How unique is our Earth?""

and action space, multiple ridges, the exact origin of which is still debated.
Recently, we demonstrated that a large Galactic bar with pattern speed 39
km/s/kpc does create most of the observed ridges. Among those ridges, the
Hercules moving group would then be associated to orbits trapped at the
co-rotation resonance of the bar. Here we show that a distinctive prediction of
such a model is that the angular momentum of Hercules at the Sun's radius must
significantly decrease with increasing Galactocentric azimuth, i.e. when
getting closer to the major axis of the bar. We show that such a dependence of
the angular momentum of trapped orbits on the azimuth would on the other hand
not happen close to the outer Lindblad resonance of a faster bar, unless the
orbital distribution is still far from phase-mixed, namely for a bar
perturbation younger than ~ 2 Gyr. Using Gaia DR2 and Bayesian distances from
the StarHorse code, and tracing the average Galactocentric radial velocity as a
function of angular momentum and azimuth, we show that the Hercules angular
momentum changes significantly with azimuth as expected for the co-rotation
resonance of a dynamically old large bar.

that our ARGAN is robust to detect both simple and complex shadows and to
produce more realistic shadow removal results. It outperforms the

imputation methods to create completed datasets, from which they can estimate
treatment effects. Common imputation methods include mean imputation, single
imputation via regression, and multiple imputation. For each of these methods,
we investigate the benefits of leveraging randomized treatment assignment in
the imputation routines, that is, making use of the fact that the true
covariate distributions are the same across treatment arms. We do so using
simulation studies that compare the quality of inferences when we respect or
disregard the randomization. We consider this question for imputation routines
implemented using covariates only, and imputation routines implemented using
the outcome variable. In either case, accounting for randomization offers only
small gains in accuracy for our simulation scenarios. Our results also shed
light on the performances of these different procedures for imputing missing

the central controller by using the metric Age of Information, namely the time
elapsed since the generation time-stamp of the freshest information. We wonder
what is the minimum AoI performance the network can achieve and how to design
scheduling algorithms to approach it. To answer these questions when scheduling
decisions are restricted to bandwidth constraint, we first decouple the
multi-user scheduling problem into a single user constrained Markov decision
process (CMDP) through relaxation of the hard bandwidth constraint. Next we
exploit the threshold structure of the optimal policy for the decoupled single
user CMDP and obtain the optimum solution through linear programming (LP).
Finally, an asymptotic optimal truncated policy that can satisfy the hard
bandwidth constraint is built upon the optimal solution to each of the
decoupled single-user sub-problem. The performance is verified through
simulations. Our investigation shows that to obtain a small AoI performance,
the scheduler exploits good channels to schedule users supported by limited
power. Users equipped with enough transmission power are updated in a timely
manner such that the bandwidth constraint can be satisfied.

spectrum produce crystalline-symmetry-enforced three-fold fermions, which
conceptually lie between the two-fold Weyl and four-fold Dirac fermions. Here
we show how a silver-based Dirac semimetal BaAgAs realizes three-fold fermions
through our first-principles calculations combined with a low-energy effective
$\mathbf{k.p}$ model Hamiltonian analysis. BaAgAs is shown to harbor
triply-degenerate nodal points, which lie on its $C_{3}$ rotation axis, and are
protected by the $C_{6v}$($C_2\otimes C_{3v}$) point-group symmetry in the
absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. When the SOC is turned on, BaAgAs
transitions into a nearly-ideal Dirac semimetal state with a pair of Dirac
nodes lying on the $C_{3}$ rotation axis. We show that breaking inversion
symmetry in the BaAgAs$_{1-x}$P$_x$ alloy yields a clean and tunable three-fold
fermion semimetal. Systematic relaxation of other symmetries in BaAgAs
generates a series of other topological phases. BaAgAs materials thus provide
an ideal platform for exploring tunable topological properties associated with
a variety of different fermionic excitations.

H$\alpha$ emission lines. Our analysis shows that GMASS 0953 may host an
ionized disc extending up to 13 kpc, which rotates at a velocity of
$V_{\rm{ion}} = 203^{+17}_{-20} {\ \rm kms}^{-1}$ at the outermost radius.
Evidence of rotation on a smaller scale ($R \sim 1$ kpc) arises from the
CO(J=6-5) line. The central velocity $V_{\rm{CO}} = 320^{+ 92}_{-53} {\ \rm

suggesting that the galaxy harbors a multi-phase disc with a rotation curve
that peaks in the very central regions. The galaxy appears well located on the
$z = 0$ baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. We also discuss the possibility that
the [O III]$\lambda 5007$ and H$\alpha$ velocity gradients are due to a
galactic-scale wind. Besides, we found evidence of an AGN-driven outflow traced
by a broad blueshifted wing affecting the [O III]$\lambda 5007$ line, which
presents a velocity offset $\Delta v = -535 \pm 152 {\ \rm kms}^{-1}$ from the
systemic velocity. Because of the short depletion timescale
($\tau_{\rm{dep}}\sim 10^8$ yr) due to gas ejection and gas consumption by star
formation activity, GMASS 0953 may likely evolve into a passive galaxy.
However, the role of the AGN in depleting the gas reservoir of the galaxy is

spintronic applications. Important characteristics such as device switching
times and magnetic domain-wall velocities depend critically on the damping
rate. While the implications of spin damping for relaxation processes are
intensively studied, damping effects during impulsive spin excitations are
assumed to be negligible because of the shortness of the excitation process.
Herein, we show that, unlike in ferromagnets, ultrafast damping plays a crucial
role in antiferromagnets because of their strongly elliptical spin precession.
In time-resolved measurements, we find that ultrafast damping results in an
immediate spin canting along the short precession axis. The interplay between
antiferromagnetic exchange and magnetic anisotropy amplifies this canting by
several orders of magnitude towards large-amplitude modulations of the
antiferromagnetic order parameter. This leverage effect discloses a highly
efficient route towards the ultrafast manipulation of magnetism in
antiferromagnetic spintronics.

relational structure of (P)PDDL planning problems to learn a common set of
weights that can be applied to any problem in a domain. By mimicking the
actions chosen by a traditional, non-learning planner on a handful of small
problems in a domain, ASNets are able to learn a generalised reactive policy
that can quickly solve much larger instances from the domain. This work extends
the ASNet architecture to make it more expressive, while still remaining
invariant to a range of symmetries that exist in PPDDL problems. We also
present a thorough experimental evaluation of ASNets, including a comparison
with heuristic search planners on seven probabilistic and deterministic
domains, an extended evaluation on over 18,000 Blocksworld instances, and an
ablation study. Finally, we show that sparsity-inducing regularisation can
produce ASNets that are compact enough for humans to understand, yielding
insights into how the structure of ASNets allows them to generalise across a

networks (QNNs) may have over classical neural networks (NNs), and in what
situations these advantages may transpire. Here we address this question by
studying the memory capacity $C$ of QNNs, which is a metric of the expressive
power of a QNN that we have adapted from classical NN theory. We present a
capacity inequality showing that the capacity of a QNN is bounded by the
information $W$ that can be trained into its parameters: $C \leq W$. One
consequence of this bound is that QNNs that are parameterized classically do
not show an advantage in capacity over classical NNs having an equal number of
parameters. However, QNNs that are parametrized with quantum states could have
exponentially larger capacities. We illustrate our theoretical results with
numerical experiments by simulating a particular QNN based on a Gaussian Boson
Sampler. We also study the influence of sampling due to wavefunction collapse
during operation of the QNN, and provide an analytical expression connecting
the capacity to the number of times the quantum system is measured.

strata corresponding to different types of singularities. Examples of such
spaces appear everywhere in topology and geometry. The study of stratified
spaces involves invariants such as intersection cohomology which are only
invariants under stratification-preserving homotopies. In this thesis, we study
the homotopy theory of stratified spaces with respect to those stratified
homotopies. To do so, we construct model categories for stratified spaces and
we introduce new invariants to characterize them, the filtered homotopy groups.
A stratified space can be seen as a topological space $X$ together with a
continuous map to a poset of strata $X\to P$. We begin our study by restricting
ourselves to the filtered case, where the poset of strata is fixed. We define
the model category of filtered simplicial sets, show that it admits a
description ""\`a la Kan"", and characterize its weak-equivalences using the
filtered homotopy groups. We deduce a proof of a filtered version of Whitehead
theorem. We then construct a model category of filtered spaces. Its
weak-equivalences are the morphisms that induce isomorphisms on all filtered
homotopy groups, and its fibrations satisfy a filtered version of Serre's
lifting conditions. We show that it is Quillen-equivalent to a category of
diagrams of simplicial sets. We then work toward a comparison between the model
categories of filtered simplicial sets and of filtered spaces. They are
connected by a Quillen-adjunction, similar to the classical Kan-Quillen
adjunction. We conjecture that it is in fact a Quillen equivalence. Lastly,
working with the notion of Quillen bifibration, we show that there are model
categories of stratified spaces and of stratified simplicial sets. We show that
the two are related by an adjunction that preserve weak equivalences.

framework, named DFO, for depth estimation and hierarchical feature
representation learning from monocular videos. By exploiting the metric
distance, our framework is able to learn the hierarchical feature
representation without supervision. The pose is obtained with a coarse-to-fine
approach from high-level to low-level features in enlarged feature maps. The
pixel-level attention mask can be self-learned to provide the prior
information. In contrast to the previous methods, our proposed method
calculates the camera motion with a direct method rather than regressing the
ego-motion from the pose network. With this approach, the consistency of the
scale factor of translation can be constrained. Additionally, the proposed
method is thus compatible with the traditional SLAM pipeline. Experiments on

reasoning ability of the framework. In the composite feature branch, a
3-channel self-attention models are constructed to weight each frame in the
video and give more attention to the key frames. Each self-attention models
channel outputs a set of attention weights to focus on a particular aspect of
the video, and a set of attention weights corresponds to a one-dimensional
vector. The 3-channel self-attention models can evaluate key frames from
multiple aspects, and the output sets of attention weight vectors form an
attention matrix, which effectively enhances the attention of key frames with
strong correlation of action. This model can implement action recognition under
zero-shot conditions, and has good recognition performance for untrimmed video

  neurophysiology learning process",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Currently virtual reality (VR) usage in training processes is increasing due
to their usefulness in the learning processes based on visual information
empowered. The information in virtual environments is perceived by sight, sound
and touch, but the relationship or impact that these stimuli can have on the
oscillatory activity of the brain such as the processing, propagation and
synchronization of information still needs to be established in relation to the
cognitive load of attention. Therefore, this study seeks to identify the
suggested epistemological basis through literature review and current research
agendas in the relationship that exists between the immersive virtual
environment and the neurophysiology of learning processes by means of the
analysis of visual information. The suggested dimensional modeling of this
research is composed by the theory of information processing which allows the
incorporation of learning through stimuli with the use of attention, perception
and storage by means of information management and the Kolb's learning model
which defines the perception and processing of information as dimensions of
learning. Regarding to the neurophysiology of learning, the literature has
established he links between the prefrontal cortex and working memory within
the process of information management. The challenges and advances discussed in
this research are based in the relationship between the identified constructs
(Income Stimuli, Information Management and Cognitive Processing) and the
establishment of a research agenda on how to identify the necessary indicators
to measure memory and attention in the virtual immersion environments.

  state friction",,,"10.1016/j.jmps.2020.103967",,"physics.geo-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerous laboratory experiments have demonstrated the dependence of the
friction coefficient on the interfacial slip rate and the contact history, a
behavior generically called rate and state friction. Although numerical models
have been widely used for analyzing rate and state friction, in general they
consider infinite elastic domains surrounding the sliding interface and rely on
boundary integral formulations. Much less work has been dedicated to modeling
finite size systems to account for interactions with boundaries. This paper
investigates rate and state frictional interfaces in the context of finite size
systems with the finite element method in explicit dynamics. We investigate the
long term behavior of the sliding interface for two different friction laws: a
velocity weakening law, for which the friction monotonously decreases with
increasing sliding velocity, and a velocity weakening-strengthening law, for
which the friction coefficient first decreases but then increases above a
critical velocity. We show that for both friction laws at finite times, that is
before wave reflections from the boundaries come back to the sliding interface,
a temporary steady state sliding is reached, with a well-defined stress drop at
the interface. This stress drop gives rise to a stress concentration and leads
to an analogy between friction and fracture. However, at longer times, that is
after multiple wave reflections, the stress drop is essentially zero, resulting
in losing the analogy with fracture mechanics. Finally, the simulations reveal
that velocity weakening is unstable at long time scales, as it results in an
acceleration of the sliding blocks. On the other hand, velocity
weakening-strengthening reaches a steady state sliding configuration.

the available channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter for precoding
to improve the performance of frequency division duplex (FDD) networks. One of
the mainchallenges is to compress a large amount of CSI in CSI feedback
transmission in massive MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
(DL)-based approach that uses a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn
temporal correlation and adopts depthwise separable convolution to shrink the
model. The feature extraction module is also elaborately devised by
studyingdecoupled spatio-temporal feature representations in different
structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms existing DL-based methods in terms of recovery quality and
accuracy, which can also achieve remarkable robustness at low compression ratio
(CR).

received extensive attention because they are expected to implement the same
pattern recognition tasks in the electronic platforms with high efficiency and
low power consumption. However, the current lack of various learning algorithms
to train the ONNs obstructs their further development. In this article, we
propose a novel learning strategy based on neuroevolution to design and train
the ONNs. Two typical neuroevolution algorithms are used to determine the
hyper-parameters of the ONNs and to optimize the weights (phase shifters) in
the connections. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the training
algorithms, the trained ONNs are applied in the classification tasks for iris
plants dataset, wine recognition dataset and modulation formats recognition.
The calculated results exhibit that the training algorithms based on
neuroevolution are competitive with other traditional learning algorithms on
both accuracy and stability. Compared with previous works, we introduce an
efficient training method for the ONNs and demonstrate their broad application
prospects in pattern recognition, reinforcement learning and so on.

foundations of a theory of concurrency that is equipped to ensure liveness

theory will encompass process algebra, temporal logic and semantic models. The
agenda also includes the development of a methodology and tools that allow
successful application of this theory to the specification, analysis and
verification of realistic distributed systems. Contemporary process algebras
and temporal logics fail to make distinctions between systems of which one has
a crucial liveness property and the other does not, at least when assuming
justness, a strong progress property, but not assuming fairness. Setting up an
alternative framework involves giving up on identifying strongly bisimilar
systems, inventing new induction principles, developing new axiomatic bases for
process algebras and new congruence formats for operational semantics, and
creating matching treatments of time and probability. Even simple systems like
fair schedulers or mutual exclusion protocols cannot be accurately specified in
standard process algebras (or Petri nets) in the absence of fairness
assumptions. Hence the work involves the study of adequate language or model
extensions, and their expressive power.
