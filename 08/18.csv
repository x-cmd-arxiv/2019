an increasingly important application of natural language processing. The
detection of trolls in public forums (Gal\'an-Garc\'ia et al., 2016), and the
deployment of chatbots in the public domain (Wolf et al., 2017) are two
examples that show the necessity of guarding against adversarially offensive
behavior on the part of humans. In this work, we develop a training scheme for
a model to become robust to such human attacks by an iterative build it, break
it, fix it strategy with humans and models in the loop. In detailed experiments
we show this approach is considerably more robust than previous systems.
Further, we show that offensive language used within a conversation critically
depends on the dialogue context, and cannot be viewed as a single sentence
offensive detection task as in most previous work. Our newly collected tasks
and methods will be made open source and publicly available.

  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides non-invasive measures
of neuronal activity using an endogenous Blood Oxygenation-Level Dependent
(BOLD) contrast. This article introduces a nonlinear dimensionality reduction
(Locally Linear Embedding) to extract informative measures of the underlying
neuronal activity from BOLD time-series. The method is validated using the
Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) accuracy of classifying psychiatric
diagnoses using resting-state and task-related fMRI.
  Methods:
  Locally Linear Embedding of BOLD time-series (into each voxel's respective
tensor) was used to optimise feature selection. This uses Gau\ss' Principle of
Least Constraint to conserve quantities over both space and time. This
conservation was assessed using LOOCV to greedily select time points in an
incremental fashion on training data that was categorised in terms of
psychiatric diagnoses.
  Findings:
  The embedded fMRI gave highly diagnostic performances (> 80%) on eleven
publicly-available datasets containing healthy controls and patients with
either Schizophrenia, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), or
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Furthermore, unlike the original fMRI data
before or after using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for artefact
reduction, the embedded fMRI furnished significantly better than chance
classification (defined as the majority class proportion) on ten of eleven
datasets
  Interpretation:
  Locally Linear Embedding appears to be a useful feature extraction procedure
that retains important information about patterns of brain activity
distinguishing among psychiatric cohorts.

resonant photoexcitation allow access to fundamental electronic structure
characteristics (momentum-resolved spectral function, dispersions and ordering
of energy bands, Fermi surface) of buried interfaces. Our experiment uses X-ray
irradiation of the LAO/STO interface to tune its oxygen deficiency, building up
a dichotomic system where mobile weakly correlated Ti t2g-electrons co-exist
with localized strongly correlated Ti eg-ones. The ARPES spectra dynamics under
X-ray irradiation shows a gradual intensity increase under constant Luttinger
count of the Fermi surface. This fact identifies electronic phase separation
(EPS) where the mobile electrons accumulate in conducting puddles with fixed
electronic structure embedded in an insulating host phase, and allows us to
estimate the lateral fraction of these puddles. We discuss the physics of EPS
invoking a theoretical picture of oxygen-vacancy clustering, promoted by the
magnetism of the localized Ti eg-electrons, and repelling of the mobile
t2g-electrons from these clusters. Our results on the irradiation-tuned EPS

constructed endogenously by estimating a scalar driving the innovation

based on the fact that damage will alter the dynamic properties viz.,
structural response, frequencies, mode shapes, etc of the structure. The
responses measured using sensors, which are high dimensional in nature, can be
intelligently analyzed using machine learning techniques for damage assessment.
Neural networks employing multilayer architectures are expressive models
capable of capturing complex relationships between input-output pairs but do
not account for uncertainty in network outputs. A BNN (Bayesian Neural Network)
refers to extending standard networks with posterior inference. It is a neural
network with a prior distribution on its weights. Deep learning architectures
like CNN (Convolutional neural network) and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) are
good candidates for representation learning from high dimensional data. The
advantage of using CNN over multi-layer neural networks is that they are good

generating hand-engineered features. LSTM networks are mainly used for sequence
modeling. This paper presents both a Bayesian multi-layer perceptron and deep
learning-based approach for damage detection and location identification in
beam-like structures. Raw frequency response data simulated using finite
element analysis is fed as the input of the network. As part of this, frequency

work-conserving scheduling policies, are controlled jump diffusions driven by a
compound Poisson jump process. We establish the asymptotic optimality of the
infinite-horizon discounted and long-run average (ergodic) problems for the
queueing dynamics.
  Since the process counting the number of customers in each class is not
Markov, the usual martingale arguments for convergence of mean empirical
measures cannot be applied. We surmount this obstacle by demonstrating the
convergence of the generators of an augmented Markovian model which
incorporates the age processes of the renewal interarrival times and downtimes.

Eigenrank can select for manual labeling, a subset of medical images from a

used to pick out, cases in a large database, where deep learning segmentation

large multi-component systems. In order to determine the role that each node
has inside a complex network, several centrality measures have been developed.
Such topological features are also important for their role in the dynamical
processes occurring in networked systems. In this paper, we argue that the
dynamical activity of the nodes may strongly reshape their relevance inside the
network making centrality measures in many cases misleading. We show that when
the dynamics taking place at the local level of the node is slower than the
global one between the nodes, then the system may lose track of the structural
features. On the contrary, when that ratio is reversed only global properties
such as the shortest distances can be recovered. From the perspective of
networks inference, this constitutes an uncertainty principle, in the sense
that it limits the extraction of multi-resolution information about the
structure, particularly in the presence of noise. For illustration purposes, we
show that for networks with different time-scale structures such as strong
modularity, the existence of fast global dynamics can imply that precise
inference of the community structure is impossible.

treatment is to reduce the frequency of exacerbations. Some observations
suggest a decline in exacerbation rates in clinical trials over time. A more
systematic understanding would help to improve the design and interpretation of
COPD trials.
  METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-regression of the placebo
groups in published randomized controlled trials reporting exacerbations as an
outcome. A Bayesian negative binomial model was developed to accommodate
results that are reported in different formats; results are reported with
credible intervals (CI) and posterior tail probabilities ($p_B$).
  RESULTS: Of 1114 studies identified by our search, 55 were ultimately
included. Exacerbation rates decreased by 6.7% (95% CI (4.4, 9.0); $p_B$ <
0.001) per year, or 50% (95% CI (36, 61)) per decade. Adjusting for available
study and baseline characteristics such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s
(FEV1) did not alter the observed trend considerably. Two subsets of studies,
one using a true placebo group and the other allowing inhaled corticosteroids
in the ""placebo"" group, also yielded consistent results.
  CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this meta-regression indicates that the rate of
COPD exacerbations decreased over the past two decades to a clinically relevant
extent independent of important prognostic factors. This suggests that care is
needed in the design of new trials or when comparing results from older trials
with more recent ones. Also a considerable effect of adjunct therapy on COPD
exacerbations can be assumed.

presence of low mass dark matter halos along the entire sight line from the
source to the observer. Traditionally, the study of dark matter structure in
compact-source strong gravitational lenses has been limited to radio-loud
systems, as the radio emission is extended and thus unaffected by microlensing
which can mimic the signal of dark matter structure. An alternate approach is
to measure quasar nuclear-narrow line emission, which is free from microlensing
and present in virtually all quasar lenses. In this paper, we double the number
of systems which can be used for gravitational lensing analyses by presenting
measurements of narrow-line emission from a sample of 8 quadruply imaged quasar

fluxes with uncertainties of 2-10\%, presented here. We fit the lensed image
positions with smooth mass models and demonstrate that these models fail to
produce the observed distribution of image fluxes over the entire sample of
lenses. Furthermore, typical deviations are larger than those expected from
macromodel uncertainties. This discrepancy indicates the presence of
perturbations caused by small-scale dark matter structure. The interpretation
of this result in terms of dark matter models is presented in a companion
paper.

parameterization schemes, where symmetries of the corresponding original model
are preserved as equivalence transformations of related classes of closed
system of differential equations. As a particular problem, we consider
invariant parameterization schemes for geostrophic eddies in a barotropic
ocean. Here the initial model is the barotropic vorticity equation, which is
equivalent to the system of incompressible inviscid two-dimensional Euler
equations on a midlatitude beta-plane. The maximal Lie invariance algebra of
this model is infinite-dimensional, and we intend to preserve it in the course
of invariant parameterization, at least partially. The parameterizations
proposed for the eddy vorticity flux and the energy flux are of order one and a
half since we explicitly consider the equation for the turbulent kinetic energy
in the closure models. These parameterizations are therefore the first examples
of invariant higher-order closure schemes. Numerical experiments are carried
out to assess the performance of these invariant schemes in studies of freely
decaying two-dimensional turbulence, and it is verified that the invariant
parameterization schemes give, on average, better results than the standard
non-invariant closure models do.

scale invariance. By imposing the scale invariant symmetry, we arrive at
choosing the logarithm of the stock's price as the proper variable to model.
The dynamics of stock log price is derived using two pieces of information, the

the same as the Geometric Brownian Motion, GBM, of the stock price which is
manifestly scale invariant. Furthermore, we come up with the dynamics of

large bit consumption due to the huge storage occupied by those measurements.
Then, the one-bit CS with binary measurements is proposed and saves the bit
budget, but it is infeasible when the energy information of signals is not
available as a prior knowledge. Subsequently, the hybrid CS which combines the
traditional CS and one-bit CS appears, striking a balance between the pros and
cons of both types of CS. Considering the fact that the one-bit CS is optimal
for the direction estimation of signals under noise with a fixed bit budget and
that the traditional CS is able to provide residue information and estimated
signals, we focus on the design of greedy algorithms, which consist of the main
steps of support detection and recovered signal update, for the hybrid CS in
this paper. We first propose a theorem on the random uniform tessellations for
sparse signals to further investigate the properties of one-bit CS. Afterwards,
we propose two greedy algorithms for the hybrid CS, with the one-bit CS
responsible for support detection and traditional CS offering updated residues
and signal estimates. For each of the proposed algorithms, we provide the
corresponding theorem with proof to analyze their capabilities theoretically.
Simulation results have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed greedy

extrapolated three-dimensional (3D) non-linear force-free fields (NLFFFs), as
well as the photospheric motions, we find that with the successive emergence of
different bipoles in the central region, the conjugate polarities separate,
resulting in collision between the non-conjugated opposite polarities.
Nearly-potential loops appear above the PIL at first, then get sheared and
merge at the collision locations as evidenced by the appearance of a continuous
EUV sigmoid on 2017 September 4, which also indicates the formation of an MFR.
The 3D NLFFFs further reveal the gradual buildup of the MFR, accompanied by the
appearance of two elongated bald patches (BPs) at the collision locations and a
very low-lying hyperbolic flux tube configuration between the BPs. The final
MFR has relatively steady axial flux and average twist number of around
$2.1\times 10^{20}$~Mx and -1.5, respective. Shearing motions are found
developing near the BPs when the collision occurs, with flux cancellation and
UV brightenings being observed simultaneously, indicating the development of a
process named as ""collisional shearing"" (firstly identified by Chintzoglou et

and evaporation, an initial pure state will evolve to a mixed state, i.e.,
information will be lost. One way of avoiding this conclusion without invoking
drastic modifications of the local laws of physics in a low curvature regime
would be for the information to be restored at the very end of the evaporation
process. It is normally envisioned that this would require a final burst of
particles entangled with the early time Hawking radiation. This would imply the
emission of an extremely large number of particles from an object of Planck
size and mass and would appear to be blatantly ruled out by energy
considerations. However, Hotta, Schutzhold, and Unruh have analyzed a
$(1+1)$-dimensional moving mirror analog of the Hawking process and have found
that, in this model, information is restored via entanglement of the early time
Hawking radiation with vacuum fluctuations in the spacetime region to the
future of the event where the mirror returns to inertial motion. We analyze
their model here and give a precise formulation of this entanglement by
introducing the notion of ""Milne particles."" We then analyze the inertial
particle and energy cost of such an entanglement of Hawking radiation with
vacuum fluctuations. We show that that, in fact, the entanglement of early time
Hawking radiation with vacuum fluctuations requires the emission of at least as
many late time inertial particles as Hawking particles. Although the energy
cost can be made small in the $(1+1)$-dimensional mirror system, this should
not be the case for the $(3+1)$-dimensional evaporating black hole system.
Thus, vacuum entanglement has the same difficulties as the more usual burst
scenarios for attempting to avoid information loss.

objective of minimizing the long-term average weighted sum of
Age-of-Information (AoI) values for different physical processes (observed by
the source nodes) at the destination node, referred to as the sum-AoI. To solve
this optimization problem, we first model this setup as an average cost Markov

longer applicable to our problem. Motivated by this, we propose a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that can learn the age-optimal policy in
a computationally-efficient manner. We further characterize the structural
properties of the age-optimal policy analytically, and demonstrate that it has
a threshold-based structure with respect to the AoI values for different

capture both the identification precision and the ensemble variability prompted
due to modeling errors. Such cutting-edge developments have been absent from
the modal identification literature, sustained as a long-standing problem at
the research spotlight. Central to this framework is a Gaussian hyper
probability model, whose mean and covariance matrix are unknown encapsulating
the uncertainty of the modal parameters. Detailed computation of this
hierarchical model is addressed under two major algorithms using Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and Laplace asymptotic approximation methods. Since
for a small number of data sets the hyper covariance matrix is often
unidentifiable, a practical remedy is suggested through the eigenbasis
transformation of the covariance matrix, which effectively reduces the number
of unknown hyper-parameters. It is also proved that under some conditions the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the hyper mean and covariance coincide
with the ensemble mean and covariance computed using the MAP estimations
corresponding to multiple data sets. This interesting finding addresses
relevant concerns related to the outcome of the mainstream Bayesian methods in
capturing the stochastic variability from dissimilar data sets. Finally, the
dynamical response of a prototype structure tested on a shaking table subjected
to Gaussian white noise base excitation and the ambient vibration measurement
of a cable footbridge are employed to demonstrate the proposed framework.

process in aqueous solutions of dispersed TiN nanoparticles under solar
illumination. The temperature gradients of solution with different
concentrations of TiN nanoparticles are calculated when confinement effects of
the container on the solar absorption are taken into account. We find that the
average penetration of solar radiation into the solution is significantly
reduced with increasing the nanoparticle concentration. At high concentrations,
our numerical results show that photons are localized near the surface of the
solution. Moreover, the heat energy balance equation at the vapor-liquid
interface is used to describe the solar steam generation. The theoretical time
dependence of temperature rise and vaporization weight losses is consistent
with experiments. Our calculations give strong evidence that the substantially
localized heating near the vapor-liquid interface is the main reason for the
more efficient steam generation process by floating plasmonic membranes when
compared to randomly dispersed nanoparticles. The validated theoretical model
suggests that our approach can be applied towards new predictions and other
experimental data descriptions.

the forward and backward pass of BP. Our ST-RSBP algorithm can be broadly
applied to RSNNs with a single recurrent layer or deep RSNNs with multiple
feed-forward and recurrent layers. Based upon challenging speech and image

hierarchy of master and slave state machines. Vision-based precision landing is
enabled by estimating the landing pad's pose using a bundle of AprilTag

an extensive evaluation of the landing pad pose estimation accuracy as a

demonstrated through two indoor experiments with a duration of 11 and 10.6

Purcell factor (F$_{p}$) of a spin-polarized emitter (right-handed circular

function. First, we introduce the concept of verifiable delay puzzle (VDP),
which resembles the hashing puzzle used in the PoW mechanism but can only be
solved sequentially. We then present a VDP implementation based on the
continuous verifiable delay function. Further, we show that VDP can be combined
with the Nakamoto consensus in a proof-of-stake/proof-of-delay hybrid protocol.
We analyze the persistence and liveness of the protocol, and show that compared
to PoW, our proposal consumes much less energy; compared to BFT leader-election
based consensus algorithms, our proposal achieves better resistance to
long-range attacks and DoS attacks targeting the block proposers.

method. Although it is theoretically proved to have better convergence
performance than stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the generalization
performance of SVRG remains open. In this paper we investigate the effects of
some training techniques, mini-batching and learning rate decay, on the
generalization performance of SVRG, and verify the generalization performance
of Batch-SVRG (B-SVRG). In terms of the relationship between optimization and
generalization, we believe that the average norm of gradients on each training
sample as well as the norm of average gradient indicate how flat the landscape
is and how well the model generalizes. Based on empirical observations of such
metrics, we perform a sign switch on B-SVRG and derive a practical algorithm,
BatchPlus-SVRG (BP-SVRG), which is numerically shown to enjoy better
generalization performance than B-SVRG, even SGD in some scenarios of deep
neural networks.

system (Pegasus, Visulytix Ltd., UK), at the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy
(DR) from images captured by a handheld portable fundus camera.
  Methods: A cohort of 6,404 patients (~80% with diabetes mellitus) was
screened for retinal diseases using a handheld portable fundus camera (Pictor
Plus, Volk Optical Inc., USA) at the Mexican Advanced Imaging Laboratory for
Ocular Research. The images were graded for DR by specialists according to the
Scottish DR grading scheme. The performance of the AI system was evaluated,
retrospectively, in assessing Referable DR (RDR) and Proliferative DR (PDR) and
compared to the performance on a publicly available desktop camera benchmark
dataset.
  Results: For RDR detection, Pegasus performed with an 89.4% (95% CI:
88.0-90.7) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve for
the MAILOR cohort, compared to an AUROC of 98.5% (95% CI: 97.8-99.2) on the
benchmark dataset. This difference was statistically significant. Moreover, no
statistically significant difference was found in performance for PDR detection
with Pegasus achieving an AUROC of 94.3% (95% CI: 91.0-96.9) on the MAILOR
cohort and 92.2% (95% CI: 89.4-94.8) on the benchmark dataset.
  Conclusions: Pegasus showed good transferability for the detection of PDR
from a curated desktop fundus camera dataset to real-world clinical practice
with a handheld portable fundus camera. However, there was a substantial, and
statistically significant, decrease in the diagnostic performance for RDR when
using the handheld device.

Besides highlighting the important differences between well-studied
classification and human pose-estimation systems w.r.t. adversarial attacks, we
also provide deep insights into the design choices of pose-estimation systems
to shape future work. We benchmark the robustness of several 2D single person
pose-estimation architectures trained on multiple datasets, MPII and COCO. In
doing so, we also explore the problem of attacking non-classification networks
including regression based networks, which has been virtually unexplored in the
past.
  \par We find that compared to classification and semantic segmentation, human
pose estimation architectures are relatively robust to adversarial attacks with
the single-step attacks being surprisingly ineffective. Our study shows that
the heatmap-based pose-estimation models are notably robust than their direct
regression-based systems and that the systems which explicitly model
anthropomorphic semantics of human body fare better than their other
counterparts. Besides, targeted attacks are more difficult to obtain than
un-targeted ones and some body-joints are easier to fool than the others. We
present visualizations of universal perturbations to facilitate unprecedented
insights into their workings on pose-estimation. Additionally, we show them to
generalize well across different networks. Finally we perform a user study

been recently adopted as a first-class programming language for Android
applications. Kotlin is achieving a significant diffusion among developers, and
several studies have highlighted various advantages of the language when
compared to Java.
  The objective of this paper is to analyze a set of open-source Android apps,
to evaluate their transition to the Kotlin programming language throughout
their lifespan and understand whether the adoption of Kotlin has impacts on the
success of Android apps.
  We mined all the projects from the F-Droid repository of Android open-source
applications, and we found the corresponding projects on the official Google
Play Store and on the GitHub platform. We defined a set of eight metrics to
quantify the relevance of Kotlin code in the latest update and through all
releases of an application. Then, we statistically analyzed the correlation
between the presence of Kotlin code in a project and popularity metrics mined
from the platforms where the apps were released.
  Of a set of 1232 projects that were updated after October 2017, near 20%
adopted Kotlin and about 12% had more Kotlin code than Java; most of the
projects that adopted Kotlin quickly transitioned from Java to the new
language. The projects featuring Kotlin had on average higher popularity
metrics; a statistically significant correlation has been found between the
presence of Kotlin and the number of stars on the GitHub repository.
  The Kotlin language seems able to guarantee a seamless migration from Java
for Android developers. With an inspection on a large set of open-source
Android apps, we observed that the adoption of the Kotlin language is rapid
(when compared to the average lifespan of an Android project) and seems to come
at no cost in terms of popularity among the users and other developers.

investigated low-frequency resistance fluctuations (noise) across the MIT and

suppression of charge ordering has been achieved by mismatching the
superlattice periodicity with the periodicity of charge ordering. We have
observed that irrespective of the presence/absence of long-range CO, the noise
magnitude is enhanced by several orders with strong non-1/$f$ ($f$ = frequency)
component when the system undergoes MIT and magnetic transition. The higher
order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveal the presence of strong
non-Gaussian components in both cases, further indicating inhomogeneous
electrical transport arising from the electronic phase separation.
Specifically, we find almost three orders of magnitude smaller noise in the
insulating phase of the sample without long-range CO compared to the sample
with CO. These findings suggest that digital synthesis can be a potential route
to implement electronic transitions of complex oxides for device application.

  Machine Vision, Cardiff, UK",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been pivotal to the success of many
state-of-the-art classification problems, in a wide variety of domains (for
e.g. vision, speech, graphs and medical imaging). A commonality within those
domains is the presence of hierarchical, spatially agglomerative
local-to-global interactions within the data. For two-dimensional images, such
interactions may induce an a priori relationship between the pixel data and the
underlying spatial ordering of the pixels. For instance in natural images,
neighboring pixels are more likely contain similar values than non-neighboring
pixels which are further apart. To that end, we propose a statistical metric
called spatial orderness, which quantifies the extent to which the input data
(2D) obeys the underlying spatial ordering at various scales. In our
experiments, we mainly find that adding convolutional layers to a CNN could be
counterproductive for data bereft of spatial order at higher scales. We also
observe, quite counter-intuitively, that the spatial orderness of CNN feature
maps show a synchronized increase during the intial stages of training, and
validation performance only improves after spatial orderness of feature maps
start decreasing. Lastly, we present a theoretical analysis (and empirical
validation) of the spatial orderness of network weights, where we find that
using smaller kernel sizes leads to kernels of greater spatial orderness and
vice-versa.

countless practical applications. Even if it has been long proven NP-hard, its
importance still motivates searching for exact solutions. This work starts by
discussing the possibility to extend an existing, very effective
branch-and-bound procedure on parallel multi-core and many-core architectures.
We analyze a parallel multi-core implementation that exploits a
divide-and-conquer approach based on a thread-pool, which does not deteriorate
the original algorithmic efficiency and it is not memory bound. We extend the
algorithm to parallel many-core GPU architectures adopting the CUDA programming
framework, and we show how to handle the heavily workload-unbalance and the
massive data dependency. Then, we suggest new heuristics that reorder the
adjacency matrix, deal with ""dead-ends"" and randomize the search with automatic
restarts, achieving significant improvements on specific cases. Finally, we
propose a portfolio approach, which integrates all the different local search
algorithms as component tools. Such portfolio, rather than choosing the best
tool for a given instance up-front, takes the decision on-line. The proposed
approach drastically limits memory bandwidth constraints and avoids other
typical portfolio fragilities as CPU and GPU versions often show a
complementary efficiency and run on separated platforms. Experimental results
support the claims and motivate further research to better exploit GPUs in
embedded task-intensive, and multi-engine parallel applications.

landmarks of object categories, such as the eyes and the nose in faces, without
manual supervision. However, this method does not explicitly guarantee that the
learned landmarks are consistent with changes between different instances of
the same object, such as different facial identities. In this paper, we develop
a new perspective on the equivariance approach by noting that dense landmark
detectors can be interpreted as local image descriptors equipped with
invariance to intra-category variations. We then propose a direct method to
enforce such an invariance in the standard equivariant loss. We do so by
exchanging descriptor vectors between images of different object instances
prior to matching them geometrically. In this manner, the same vectors must
work regardless of the specific object identity considered. We use this
approach to learn vectors that can simultaneously be interpreted as local
descriptors and dense landmarks, combining the advantages of both. Experiments
on standard benchmarks show that this approach can match, and in some cases
surpass state-of-the-art performance amongst existing methods that learn
landmarks without supervision. Code is available at

attention and discussion. Under heterogeneity, semiparametric regression is a
popular choice to model data in statistics. In this paper, we take advantages
of expectile regression in computation and analysis of heterogeneity, and
propose the regularized partially linear additive expectile regression with
nonconvex penalty, for example, SCAD or MCP for such high-dimensional
heterogeneous data. We focus on a more realistic scenario: the regression error
is heavy-tailed distributed and only has finite moments, which is violated with
the classical sub-gaussian distribution assumption and more common in practise.
Under some regular conditions, we show that with probability tending to one,
the oracle estimator is one of the local minima of our optimization problem.
The theoretical study indicates that the dimension cardinality of linear
covariates our procedure can handle with is essentially restricted by the
moment condition of the regression error. For computation, since the
corresponding optimization problem is nonconvex and nonsmooth, we derive a
two-step algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the
proposed method enjoys good performances in estimation accuracy and model
selection through Monto Carlo simulation studies and a real data example.
What's more, by taking different expectile weights $\alpha$, we are able to
detect heterogeneity and explore the entire conditional distribution of the
response variable, which indicates the usefulness of our proposed method for
analyzing high dimensional heterogeneous data.

an analysis of 3D MHD simulations through forward modeling of synthetic Stokes

Stokes profiles are spatially and spectrally degraded considering typical
instrument properties. Line bisector shifts of the Fe\sci 6301.5 \AA~ line are
used to determine line-of-sight velocities. Far wing magnetograms are
constructed from the Stokes V profiles of the Fe\sci 6302.5 \AA~ line. While we
find an overall good agreement between observations and simulations, the
fraction of opposite polarity magnetic field, the downflow filling factor and
the opposite polarity-downflow association are strongly affected by spatial
smearing and presence of strong gradients in the line-of-sight magnetic field

downflows are hidden in the observations due to typical instrumental noise.
Comparing simulations that differ by more than a factor of two in grid spacing

estimating 3D model for in-the-wild images remains a formidable challenge. The
reason lies in the fact that obtaining high-quality 3D annotations for
in-the-wild images is an extremely hard task that consumes enormous amount of
resources and manpower. To tackle this problem, previous methods adopt a hybrid
training strategy that exploits multiple heterogeneous types of annotations
including 3D and 2D while leaving the efficacy of each annotation not
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive study
on cost and effectiveness trade-off between different annotations.
Specifically, we focus on the challenging task of in-the-wild 3D human recovery
from single images when paired 3D annotations are not fully available. Through
extensive experiments, we obtain several observations: 1) 3D annotations are
efficient, whereas traditional 2D annotations such as 2D keypoints and body
part segmentation are less competent in guiding 3D human recovery. 2) Dense
Correspondence such as DensePose is effective. When there are no paired
in-the-wild 3D annotations available, the model exploiting dense correspondence
can achieve 92% of the performance compared to a model trained with paired 3D
data. We show that incorporating dense correspondence into in-the-wild 3D human
recovery is promising and competitive due to its high efficiency and relatively
low annotating cost. Our model trained with dense correspondence can serve as a
strong reference for future research.

promises to revolutionize our ability to solve broad classes of problems.
Surprisingly, the basic mathematical structures of gate-based quantum
computing, such as unitary operations on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space,
are not unique to quantum systems but may be found in certain classical systems
as well.
  Previously, it has been shown that one can represent an arbitrary multi-qubit
quantum state in terms of classical analog signals using nested quadrature
amplitude modulated signals. Furthermore, using digitally controlled analog
electronics one may manipulate these signals to perform quantum gate operations
and thereby execute quantum algorithms. The computational capacity of a single
signal is, however, limited by the required bandwidth, which scales
exponentially with the number of qubits when represented using frequency-based
encoding.
  To overcome this limitation, we introduce a method to extend this approach to
multiple parallel signals. Doing so allows a larger quantum state to be
emulated with the same gate time required for processing frequency-encoded
signals. In the proposed representation, each doubling of the number of signals
corresponds to an additional qubit in the spatial domain. Single quit gate
operations are similarly extended so as to operate on qubits represented using
either frequency-based or spatial encoding schemes. Furthermore, we describe a
method to perform gate operations between pairs of qubits represented using
frequency or spatial encoding or between frequency-based and spatially encoded
qubits. Finally, we describe how this approach may be extended to represent
qubits in the time domain as well.

interaction is a highly interesting area of space physics because it helps to
better understand the basic physics of plasma flows in the universe and it
provides geophysical information about the interior of the moons.
Moon-magnetosphere interaction is caused by the flow of magnetospheric plasma
relative to the orbital motions of the moons. The relative velocity is usually
slower than the Alfv\'en velocity of the plasma around the moons. Thus the
interaction generally forms Alfv\'en wings instead of bow shocks in front of
the moons. The local interaction, i.e., the interaction within several moon
radii, is controlled by properties of the atmospheres, ionospheres, surfaces,
nearby dust-populations, the interiors of the moons as well as the properties
of the magnetospheric plasma around the moons. The far-field interaction, i.e.,
the interaction further away than a few moon radii, is dominated by the
magnetospheric plasma and the fields, but it still carries information about
the properties of the moons. In this chapter we review the basic physics of
moon-magnetosphere interaction. We also give a short tour through the solar
system highlighting the important findings at the major moons.

well-known that if $(X_t)$ is aperiodic and satisfies a drift and minorization
condition, then it converges to its stationary distribution $\pi$ at an
exponential rate. We consider the problem of computing upper bounds for the
distance from stationarity in terms of the drift and minorization data.
  Baxendale showed that these bounds improve significantly if one assumes that
$(X_t)$ is reversible with nonnegative eigenvalues (i.e. its transition kernel
is a self-adjoint operator on $L^2(\pi)$ with spectrum contained in $[0,1]$).
We identify this phenomenon as a special case of a general principle: for a
reversible chain with nonnegative eigenvalues, any strong random time gives
direct control over the convergence rate. We formulate this principle precisely
and deduce from it a stronger version of Baxendale's result.
  Our approach is fully quantitative and allows us to convert drift and
minorization data into explicit convergence bounds. We show that these bounds
are tighter than those of Rosenthal and Baxendale when applied to a
well-studied example.

collimated gamma-ray beams from structured laser-irradiated targets with a
pre-filled cylindrical channel. The channel guides the incident laser pulse,
enabling generation of a slowly evolving azimuthal plasma magnetic field that
serves two key functions: to enhance laser-driven electron acceleration and to
induce emission of gamma-rays by the energetic electrons. Our main finding is
that the conversion efficiency of the laser energy into a beam of gamma-rays
($5^{\circ}$ opening angle) can be significantly increased without increasing
the laser intensity by utilizing channels with an optimal density. The
conversion efficiency into multi-MeV photons increases roughly linearly with
the incident laser power $P$, as we increase $P$ from 1 PW to 4 PW while
keeping the laser peak intensity fixed at $5 \times 10^{22}$ W/cm$^2$. This
scaling is achieved by using an optimal range of plasma densities in the
channel between 10 and $20 n_{cr}$, where $n_{cr}$ is the classical cutoff
density for electromagnetic waves. The corresponding number of photons scales
as $P^2$. One application that directly benefits from such a strong scaling is
the pair production via two-photon collisions, with the number of generated
pairs increasing as $P^4$ at fixed laser intensity.

First of all, based on the characteristics of shilling attack quickness
(Attackers inject a large number of fake profiles in a short period in order to
save costs), we use dynamic time interval method to divide the rating history
of item into multiple time windows. Then, we use the T-distribution to detect

the human body motion is represented by a sequence of enhanced depth maps. The
input data is provided by a system consisting of a Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth
camera and two mirrors. This approach proposes two feature types to describe
characteristics of localized points of interest and the level of posture
symmetry. These two features are processed on a sequence of enhanced depth maps
with the support of a sliding window to provide two corresponding scores. The
gait assessment is finally performed based on a weighted combination of these
two scores. The evaluation is performed by experimenting on 6 simulated
abnormal gaits.

where they often present a challenge to theory. In condensed matter, the
interplay of Coulomb interaction and disorder remains largely an unsolved
problem. In two dimensional films the long-range part of the Coulomb
interaction may be screened by a nearby metallic overlay. This technique is
employed in this work to present experimental evidence for its effectiveness in
limiting the spatial range of the Coulomb interaction. We use this approach to
study the effects of the long-range Coulomb interaction on the
out-of-equilibrium dynamics of electron-glasses using amorphous indium-oxide
films. The results demonstrate that electronic relaxation times, extending over
thousands of seconds, do not hinge on the long-range Coulomb interaction nor on
the presence of a real gap in the density of states. Rather, they emphasize the
dominant role played by disorder in controlling the slow thermalization
processes of Anderson insulators taken far from equilibrium.

important for real-time monitoring and control of the power system. The
emergence of cyber attacks has brought new challenges to the state estimation
of generators. Especially, false data injection (FDI) attacks deteriorate the
accuracy of state estimation by injecting the false data into the measurement
device. In this regard, this paper proposes for the first time an FDI attack
model based on the dynamic state estimation of generators. Firstly, Taylor's
formula was used to linearize the generator's measurement equation. Secondly,
according to the principle that the measurement residuals before and after the
FDI attack are equal, the expressions of the attack vectors were established,
and they were applied to the measurement quantities to avoid the conventional
bad data detection. Thereby, the FDI attacks were successfully implemented.
Then, three attack scenarios were set according to the degree of the FDI
attacks, and they were tested by the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and the
robust cubature Kalman filter (RCKF). Finally, the simulation results of the
IEEE 9-bus system and the New England 16-machine 68-bus system verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FDI attacks.

finest meaningful semantic granularity. However, in many languages and
specialized corpora, words are composed by concatenating semantically
meaningful subword structures. Word-level analysis cannot leverage the semantic
information present in such subword structures. With regard to word embedding
techniques, this leads to not only poor embeddings for infrequent words in
long-tailed text corpora but also weak capabilities for handling
out-of-vocabulary words. In this paper we propose MorphMine for unsupervised
morpheme segmentation. MorphMine applies a parsimony criterion to
hierarchically segment words into the fewest number of morphemes at each level
of the hierarchy. This leads to longer shared morphemes at each level of
segmentation. Experiments show that MorphMine segments words in a variety of
languages into human-verified morphemes. Additionally, we experimentally
demonstrate that utilizing MorphMine morphemes to enrich word embeddings
consistently improves embedding quality on a variety of of embedding
