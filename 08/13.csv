symmetric operators under the action of a group of symmetries is presented. For
a given group $G$, criteria for the existence of $G$-invariant self-adjoint
extensions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator over a Riemannian manifold are
illustrated and critically revisited. These criteria are employed for
characterising self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on an
infinite set of intervals, $\Omega$, constituting a quantum circuit, which are
invariant under a given action of the group $\mathbb{Z}$. A study of the
different unitary representations of the group $\mathbb{Z}$ on the space of
square integrable functions on $\Omega$ is performed and the corresponding
$\mathbb{Z}$-invariant self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
are introduced. The study and characterisation of the invariance properties
allows for the determination of the spectrum and generalised eigenfunctions in
particular examples.

acceleration or deceleration, on partially synchrotron self-absorbed radio
spectra from cores of radio-loud active galactic nuclei and black-hole binaries
in the hard state. In about a half of quasars and radio galaxies, their core
radio spectra are observed to be soft, i.e., have the spectral index of
$\alpha<0$. If they are emitted by jets with constant Lorentz factors, that
softness implies deposition of large amounts of energy at large distances from
the centre. We show here that such soft spectra can be explained without that
energetic requirement by emission of jets with the Doppler factor increasing
with the distance. This can happen for either jet acceleration or deceleration,
depending on the jet viewing angle. We find our model can explain the quiescent
radio to X-ray spectra of the BL Lac objects Mrk 421 and Mrk 501.

  Survey of Military Caregivers",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Probability samples are the preferred method for providing inferences that
are generalizable to a larger population. However, when a small (or rare)
subpopulation is the group of interest, this approach is unlikely to yield a
sample size large enough to produce precise inferences. Non-probability (or
convenience) sampling often provides the necessary sample size to yield
efficient estimates, but selection bias may compromise the generalizability of
results to the broader population. Motivating the exposition is a survey of
military caregivers; our interest is focused on unpaid caregivers of wounded,
ill, or injured servicemembers and veterans who served in the US armed forces
following September 11, 2001. An extensive probability sampling effort yielded
only 72 caregivers from this subpopulation. Therefore, we consider
supplementing the probability sample with a convenience sample from the same
subpopulation, and we develop novel methods of statistical weighting that may
be used to combine (or blend) the samples. Our analyses show that the
subpopulation of interest endures greater hardships than caregivers of veterans
with earlier dates of service, and these conclusions are discernably stronger
when blended samples with the proposed weighting schemes are used. We conclude
with simulation studies that illustrate the efficacy of the proposed
techniques, examine the bias-variance trade-off encountered when using
inadequately blended data, and show that the gain in precision provided by the
convenience sample is lower in circumstances where the outcome is strongly
related to the auxiliary variables used for blending.

  (https://cran.r-project.org/package=RRI)",,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dominant paradigm in statistical inference relies on a structure of
i.i.d. data from a hypothetical infinite population. Despite its success, this
framework is inflexible under complex data structures, even in those cases
where it is clear what the infinite population represents. In this paper, we
explore an alternative framework whereby the basis of inference is only an
invariance assumption on the model errors, such as exchangeability or sign
symmetry. As a general method to address this problem of invariant inference,
we propose a randomization-based procedure. We prove general conditions for
asymptotic validity of this procedure, and illustrate in many data structures,
including clustered errors in one-way and two-way layouts. We find that
invariant inference via residual randomization has three appealing properties:
(1) It is valid under weak and interpretable conditions, allowing for problems
with heavy-tailed data, finite clustering, and even some high-dimensional
settings. (2) It is robust in finite samples as it does not rely on the
regularity conditions needed for classical asymptotics. (3) It addresses the
problem of inference in a unified way that adapts to the data structure.
Classical procedures like OLS or bootstrap, on the other hand, presuppose the
i.i.d. structure, and need to be modified whenever the actual problem structure
is different. This mismatch in the classical framework has led to a multitude
of robust error techniques and bootstrap variants, which frequently confounds
applied research. We corroborate these findings with extensive empirical
evaluations. Residual randomization performs favorably against many
alternatives, including robust error methods, bootstrap variants, and
hierarchical models.

Strominger-Yau-Zaslow arXiv:hep-th/9606040 described how such pairs arise

Landau-Ginzburg model $(Y,v_0)$ equipped with a holomorphic function $v_0:Y \to

describe an embedding of a full subcategory of $D^bCoh(\Sigma_2)$ into a
cohomological Fukaya-Seidel category of $Y$ as a symplectic fibration. While
our fibration is one of the first nonexact, non-Lefschetz fibrations to be
equipped with a Fukaya category, the main geometric idea in defining it is the
same as in Seidel's construction for Fukaya categories of Lefschetz fibrations

  In the more natural bounded error model, we show that the amount of space

variables on the circle, the sample Fr\'echet mean fluctuates around the
population mean asymptotically at a scale $n^{-\tau}$ with exponent $\tau <
1/2$ with a non-normal distribution if the probability density at the antipodal
point of the mean is $\frac{1}{2\pi}$. The author and his collaborator recently
discovered that $\tau = 1/6$ for some random variables on higher dimensional
spheres. In this article we show that, even more surprisingly, the phenomenon
on spheres of higher dimension is qualitatively different from that on the
circle, as it depends purely on geometrical properties of the space, namely its
curvature, and not on the density at the antipodal point. This gives rise to
the new concept of geometrical smeariness. In consequence, the sphere can be
deformed, say, by removing a neighborhood of the antipodal point of the mean
and gluing a flat space there, with a smooth transition piece. This yields
smeariness on a manifold, which is diffeomorphic to Euclidean space. We give an
example family of random variables with 2-smeary mean, i.e. with $\tau = 1/6$,
whose range has a hole containing the cut locus of the mean. The hole size
exhibits a curse of dimensionality as it can increase with dimension,
converging to the whole hemisphere opposite a local Fr\'echet mean. We observe
smeariness in simulated landmark shapes on Kendall pre-shape space and in real
data of geomagnetic north pole positions on the two-dimensional sphere.

paper, we characterise the exact sampling distribution of the estimated optimal

several advantages, {e.g.} (i) it determines the sampling distribution of the
estimated optimal portfolio weights by expressions, which could be used to draw
samples from this distribution efficiently; (ii) the application of the derived
stochastic representation provides an easy way to obtain the asymptotic
approximation of the sampling distribution. The later property is used to show
that the high-dimensional asymptotic distribution of optimal portfolio weights
is a multivariate normal and to determine its parameters. Moreover, a
consistent estimator of optimal portfolio weights and their characteristics is
derived under the high-dimensional settings. Via an extensive simulation study,
we investigate the finite-sample performance of the derived asymptotic
approximation and study its robustness to the violation of the model

of 32 galaxies, from 2-D Fourier analyses. The strength of spirals is
quantified from the tangential-to-radial force ratio and from the normalised
$m=2$ Fourier density amplitudes. In galaxies with more than one measured
logarithmic segment, the spiral pitch angle varies on average by $\sim
10^{\circ}$ between segments, but by up to $\gtrsim 15-20^{\circ}$. The
distribution of the global pitch angle versus Hubble type ($T$) is very similar
for barred and non-barred galaxies when $1 \lesssim T \lesssim 5$. Most spiral
galaxies ($>90\%$) are barred for $T>5$. The pitch angle is not correlated with
bar strength, and only weakly with spiral strength. The amplitude of spirals is
correlated with bar strength (and less tightly, with bar length) for all types
of spirals. The mean pitch angle is hardly correlated with the mass of the
supermassive black hole (estimated from central stellar velocity dispersion),
with central stellar mass concentration, or with shear, questioning previous
results in the literature using smaller samples. We do not find observational
evidence that spiral arms are driven by stellar bars or by invariant manifolds.
Most likely, disks that are prone to the development of strong bars are also
reactive to the formation of prominent spirals, explaining the observed
coupling between bar and spiral amplitudes (Abridged).

to the large dipole moment along its $b$-inertial axis, and because the
bimolecular reaction between two highly abundant astronomical fragments (CCH

abundance of both species relative to hydrogen are $10^{-9}$-$10^{-10}$. We
thus conclude that neither isomer is a major reservoir of interstellar sulfur

preserving polarity in regeneration, over orders of magnitude in body size

polarity preservation in regeneration, our system includes sensitivity of cell

quantify the degree to which imposing a symmetry constraint on quantum channels

this analysis, the convex structure and extremal points of the set of quantum

allows us to derive bounds on the deviation from conservation laws under any
symmetric quantum channel in terms of the deviation from closed dynamics as
measured by the unitarity of the channel. In particular, we investigate in
detail the $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ symmetries related to energy and angular momentum
conservation laws. In the latter case, we provide fundamental limits on how
much a spin-$j_A$ system can be used to polarise a larger spin-$j_B$ system,

operation. Finally, we also establish novel links between unitarity,

where the goal is to offload the computation of an arbitrary polynomial
function of some massive private matrices (inputs) to a cluster of workers. The
workers are not reliable. Some of them may collude to gain information about
the input data (semi-honest workers). The system is initialized by sharing a
(randomized) function of each input matrix to each server. Since the input
matrices are massive, each share's size is assumed to be at most $1/k$ fraction
of the input matrix, for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. The objective is to minimize
the number of workers needed to perform the computation task correctly, such
that even if an arbitrary subset of $t-1$ workers, for some $t \in \mathbb{N}$,
collude, they cannot gain any information about the input matrices. We propose
a sharing scheme, called \emph{polynomial sharing}, and show that it admits
basic operations such as adding and multiplication of matrices and transposing
a matrix. By concatenating the procedures for basic operations, we show that
any polynomial function of the input matrices can be calculated, subject to the

in terms of the number of workers needed, compared to the approaches formed by
the concatenation of job splitting and conventional MPC approaches.

decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits, and are particularly
detrimental in devices with high kinetic inductance, such as high impedance
resonators, qubits, and detectors. Despite significant progress in the
understanding of QP dynamics, pinpointing their origin and decreasing their
density remain outstanding tasks. The cyclic process of recombination and
generation of QPs implies the exchange of phonons between the superconducting
thin film and the underlying substrate. Reducing the number of substrate
phonons with frequencies exceeding the spectral gap of the superconductor
should result in a reduction of QPs. Indeed, we demonstrate that surrounding
high impedance resonators made of granular aluminum (grAl) with lower gapped
thin film aluminum islands increases the internal quality factors of the
resonators in the single photon regime, suppresses the noise, and reduces the
rate of observed QP bursts. The aluminum islands are positioned far enough from
the resonators to be electromagnetically decoupled, thus not changing the
resonator frequency, nor the loading. We therefore attribute the improvements
observed in grAl resonators to phonon trapping at frequencies close to the
spectral gap of aluminum, well below the grAl gap.

broken dynamically due to a lepton number carrier scalar singlet which acquires
a non-zero vacuum expectation value. In the present scenario the Dark Matter

mixing between the new scalar singlet and the Higgs doublet. We identify three
different Dark Matter mass regions below 1 TeV that can account for the right

frustration can be quantified as the discrepancy between the energy of locally
preferred structures and the ground state. Our definition is scale-dependent
and involves an optimization over a gauge class of equivalent local energy
landscapes, related to one another by local energy displacements. This ensures
that frustration depends only on the physical Hamiltonian and its range, and
not on unphysical choices in how it is written. Our framework shows that a
number of popular frustrated models, including the antiferromagnetic Ising
model on a triangular lattice, only have finite-range frustration: geometrical
incompatibilities are local and can be eliminated by an exact coarse-graining
of the local energies.

Such a setup is consistent with either in-situ formation or arrival at sub-AU
orbits due to disk migration. Most previous N-body experiments have focused on
""cold"" Jupiters at several AU, where scattering results in planet ejections,
efficiently exciting the eccentricities of surviving planets. In contrast,
scattering at sub-AU distances results in a mixture of collisions and
ejections, and the final eccentricities of surviving planets are unclear. We
conduct scattering experiments for a range of planet masses and initial
spacings, including the effect of general relativistic apsidal precession, and
systematically catalogue the scattering outcomes and properties of surviving
planets. A comparable number of one-planet and two-planet systems are produced.
Two-planet systems arise exclusively through planet-planet collisions, and tend
to have low eccentricities/mutual inclinations and compact configurations.
One-planet systems arise through a combination of ejections and collisions,
resulting in higher eccentricities. The observed eccentricity distribution of
solitary WJs (lacking detection of a giant planet companion) is consistent with
roughly 60% of the systems having undergone in-situ scattering, and the
remaining experiencing a quiescent history.

strength in qudit chains evolved by random unitary circuits and subject to
either weak or random projective measurements. The transition can be understood
as a nonanalytic change in the amount of information extracted by the
measurements about the initial state of the system, quantified by the Fisher
information. To compute the von~Neumann entanglement entropy $S$ and the Fisher
information $\mathcal{F}$, we apply a replica method based on a sequence of
quantities $\tilde{S}^{(n)}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$ that depend on the $n$-th
moments of density matrices and reduce to $S$ and $\mathcal{F}$ in the limit
$n\to 1$. These quantities with $n\ge 2$ are mapped to free energies of a
classical spin model with $n!$ internal states in two dimensions with specific
boundary conditions. In particular, $\tilde{S}^{(n)}$ is the excess free energy
of a domain wall terminating on the top boundary, and $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$ is
related to the magnetization on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as
the spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. Taking the limit of
large local Hilbert space dimension $q$ followed by the replica limit $n\to 1$,
we obtain the critical measurement probability $p_c=1/2$ and identify the
transition as a bond percolation in the 2D square lattice in this limit.
Finally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed
in an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the
phase transition and information scrambling. We establish an explicit
connection between the entanglement phase transition and the purification
dynamics of a mixed state evolution and discuss implications of our results to
experimental observations of the transition and simulability of quantum

a balance between their internal kinetic pressure and external pressure from

function of the virial parameter and host galactic environment. The trend
observed for clouds in low-pressure environments--as the solar neighborhood--is
well matched by state-of-the-art turbulence-regulated models of star formation.

transition between a Dirac semi-metal and the antiferromagnetic insulator. The
aim of this article is to provide a detailed comparison between these
approaches by computing static properties, notably ground-state energy,
single-particle gap, double occupancy, and staggered magnetization, as well as
dynamical quantities such as the single-particle spectral function. At the
static mean-field level local moments cannot be generated without breaking the
SU(2) spin symmetry. The DMFT approximation accounts for temporal fluctuations,
thus captures both the evolution of the double occupancy and the resulting
local moment formation in the paramagnetic phase. As a consequence, the DMFT
approximation is found to be very accurate in the Dirac semi-metallic phase
where local moment formation is present and the spin correlation length small.
However, in the vicinity of the fermion quantum critical point the spin
correlation length diverges and the spontaneous SU(2) symmetry breaking leads
to low-lying Goldstone modes in the magnetically ordered phase. The impact of
these spin fluctuations on the single-particle spectral function --
\textit{waterfall} features and narrow spin-polaron bands -- is only visible in
the lattice QMC approach.

survey, updating the calculation presented in the Euclid Red Book in several
ways. We account for revisions to the Euclid near-infrared filter wavelengths;
we adopt steeper rates of decline of the quasar luminosity function (QLF;
$\Phi$) with redshift, $\Phi\propto10^{k(z-6)}$, $k=-0.72$, and a further
steeper rate of decline, $k=-0.92$; we use better models of the contaminating
populations (MLT dwarfs and compact early-type galaxies); and we use an
improved Bayesian selection method, compared to the colour cuts used for the
Red Book calculation, allowing the identification of fainter quasars, down to
$J_{AB}\sim23$. Quasars at $z>8$ may be selected from Euclid $OYJH$ photometry
alone, but selection over the redshift interval $7<z<8$ is greatly improved by
the addition of $z$-band data from, e.g., Pan-STARRS and LSST. We calculate
predicted quasar yields for the assumed values of the rate of decline of the
QLF beyond $z=6$. For the case that the decline of the QLF accelerates beyond
$z=6$, with $k=-0.92$, Euclid should nevertheless find over 100 quasars with
$7.0<z<7.5$, and $\sim25$ quasars beyond the current record of $z=7.5$,
including $\sim8$ beyond $z=8.0$. The first Euclid quasars at $z>7.5$ should be
found in the DR1 data release, expected in 2024. It will be possible to
determine the bright-end slope of the QLF, $7<z<8$, $M_{1450}<-25$, using 8m
class telescopes to confirm candidates, but follow-up with JWST or E-ELT will
be required to measure the faint-end slope. Contamination of the candidate
lists is predicted to be modest even at $J_{AB}\sim23$. The precision with
which $k$ can be determined over $7<z<8$ depends on the value of $k$, but
assuming $k=-0.72$ it can be measured to a 1 sigma uncertainty of 0.07.

it varies, either between or within galaxies. Here we present the results of a
proof-of concept study, using the DustPedia data for two nearby face-on spiral
galaxies M74 (NGC 628) and M83 (NGC 5236), to create the first ever maps of

that exploits the fact that the dust-to-metals ratio of the interstellar medium
is constrained by direct measurements of the depletion of gas-phase metals. We
apply this method pixel-by-pixel within M74 and M83, to create maps of
$\kappa_{d}$. We also demonstrate a novel method of producing metallicity maps
for galaxies with irregularly-sampled measurements, using the machine learning
technique of Gaussian process regression. We find strong evidence for
significant variation in $\kappa_{d}$. We find values of $\kappa_{d}$ at 500
$\mu$m spanning the range 0.11-0.25 ${\rm m^{2}\,kg^{-1}}$ in M74, and
0.15-0.80 ${\rm m^{2}\,kg^{-1}}$ in M83. Surprisingly, we find that
$\kappa_{d}$ shows a distinct inverse correlation with the local density of the
interstellar medium. This inverse correlation is the opposite of what is
predicted by standard dust models. However, we find this relationship to be
robust against a large range of changes to our method - only the adoption of
unphysical or highly unusual assumptions would be able to suppress it.

the methods based on this approach operate at a fixed timescale - either a
single time-instant (eg. frame-based) or a constant time duration (eg.

timescales. For example, jumping is a short term anomaly and loitering is a
long term anomaly in a surveillance scenario. A single and pre-defined

different time duration. In this paper, we propose a multi-timescale model to
capture the temporal dynamics at different timescales. In particular, the
proposed model makes future and past predictions at different timescales for a
given input pose trajectory. The model is multi-layered where intermediate
layers are responsible to generate predictions corresponding to different

dependence of the thermal conductivity (k) of chain-oriented amorphous

temperature corresponding to a peak k progressively decreases. Un-oriented PE
exhibits the peak k at 350 K, while aligned PE under an applied strain of 400%
shows a maximum at 100 K. This transition of peak k to lower temperatures with
increasing alignment is explained in terms of a crossover from disorder to
anharmonicity dominated phonon transport in aligned polymers. Evidence for this
crossover is achieved by manipulating the disorder in the polymer structure and
studying the resulting change in temperature corresponding to peak k. Disorder
is modified through a change in the dihedral parameters of the potential
function, allowing a change in the relative fraction of trans and gauche
transformations. The results shed light on the underlying thermal transport
processes in aligned polymers and hold importance for low temperature
applications of polymer materials in thermal management technologies.

spite of having sufficiently small residual in the optimality conditions. This
issue may be framed in terms of the discrepancy between forward error (the
unmeasurable `true error') and backward error (the measurable violation of
optimality conditions). In his seminal work, Sturm provided an upper bound on
forward error in terms of backward error and singularity degree. In this paper
we provide a method to bound the maximum rank over all solutions and use this
result to obtain a lower bound on forward error for a class of convergent
sequences. This lower bound complements the upper bound of Sturm. The results
of Sturm imply that semidefinite programs with slow convergence necessarily

shown to be linked to a graph's structural and dynamical aspects such as
cyclicity, stability and normality. Trophic levels of vertices can reveal their
functional properties and partition and rank the vertices accordingly. Yet
trophic levels and hence trophic coherence can only be defined on graphs with
basal vertices, vertices with zero in-degree. Consequently, trophic analysis of
graphs had been restricted until now. In this paper we introduce a novel
framework, a generalisation of trophic levels, which we call hierarchical
levels, that can be defined on any simple graph. Within this general framework,
we develop additional metrics named influence centrality, a measure of a
vertices ability to influence dynamics, and democracy coefficient, a measure of
overall feedback in the system, both of which have implications for the
controllability of complex systems. We discuss how our generalisation relates
to previous attempts and what new insights are illuminated on the topological
and dynamical aspects of graphs. Finally, we show how the hierarchical
structure of a network relates to the incidence rate in a SIS epidemic model.

unconventional superconductivity, which supposedly originates from
non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) properties of the normal state. When studying Hund
metals using dynamical mean-field theory, one arrives at a self-consistent
""Hund impurity problem"" involving a multiorbital quantum impurity with nonzero
Hund coupling interacting with a metallic bath. If its spin and orbital degrees
of freedom are screened at different energy scales, $T_\mathrm{sp} <
T_\mathrm{orb}$, the intermediate energy window is governed by a novel NFL
fixed point, whose nature had not yet been clarified. We resolve this problem
by providing an analytical solution of a paradigmatic example of a Hund
impurity problem, involving two spin and three orbital degrees of freedom. To
this end, we combine a state-of-the-art implementation of the numerical
renormalization group, capable of exploiting non-Abelian symmetries, with a
generalization of Affleck and Ludwig's conformal field theory (CFT) approach
for multichannel Kondo models. We characterize the NFL fixed point of Hund
metals in detail for a Kondo model with an impurity forming an
SU(2)$\times$SU(3) spin-orbital multiplet, tuned such that the NFL energy
window is very wide. The impurity's spin and orbital susceptibilities then
exhibit striking power-law behavior, which we explain using CFT arguments. We
find excellent agreement between CFT predictions and numerical renormalization
group results. Our main physical conclusion is that the regime of spin-orbital
separation, where orbital degrees of freedom have been screened but spin
degrees of freedom have not, features anomalously strong local spin
fluctuations: the impurity susceptibility increases as
$\chi_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{imp} \sim \omega^{-\gamma}$, with $\gamma > 1$.

looked for ways to empirically investigate new technologies such as inspecting
the effectiveness of new methods, tools, or practices. With this purpose, the
empirical software engineering domain started to identify different empirical
methods, borrowing them from various domains such as medicine, biology, and
psychology. Nowadays, a variety of empirical methods are commonly applied in
software engineering, ranging from controlled and quasi-controlled experiments
to case studies, from systematic literature reviews to the newly introduced
multivocal literature reviews. However, to date, the only available method for
proving any cause-effect relationship are controlled experiments. Objectives.
The goal of the thesis is introducing new methodologies for studying causality
in empirical software engineering. Methods. Other fields use observational
studies for proving causality. They allow observing the effect of a risk factor
and testing this without trying to change who is or is not exposed to it. As an
example, with an observational study it is possible to observe the effect of
pollution on the growth of a forest or the effect of different factors on
development productivity without the need of waiting years for the forest to
grow or exposing developers to a specific treatment. Conclusion. In this
thesis, we aim at defining a methodology for applying observational studies in
empirical software engineering, providing guidelines on how to conduct such
studies, how to analyze the data, and how to report the studies themselves.

find a ratio between rotational and gravitational energies, $\beta$, of $\sim
0.046$ for the droplets, and when including both droplets and larger-scale
dense cores, we find $\beta \sim 0.039$. We then examine the alignment between
the velocity gradient and the major axis of each droplet, using methods adapted

step to allow such platforms to permeate safety-critical applications (i.e.,
the localization of autonomous platforms in urban environments). One of the
primary components of such a robotic platform is the state estimation engine,
which enables the platform to reason about itself and the environment based
upon sensor readings. When such sensor readings are degraded traditional state
estimation approaches are known to breakdown. To overcome this issue, several
robust state estimation frameworks have been proposed. One such method is the
batch covariance estimation (BCE) framework. The BCE approach enables robust
state estimation by iteratively updating the measurement error uncertainty
model through the fitting of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to the measurement
residuals. This paper extends upon the BCE approach by arguing that the
uncertainty estimation process should be augmented to include metadata (e.g.,
the signal strength of the associated GNSS observation). The modification of
the uncertainty estimation process to an augmented data space is significant
because it increases the likelihood of a unique partitioning in the measurement
residual domain and thus provides the ability to more accurately characterize
the measurement uncertainty model. The proposed batch covariance estimation
over an augmented data-space (BCE-AD) is experimentally validated on collected
data where it is shown that a significant increase in state estimation accuracy
can be granted compared to previously proposed robust estimation techniques.

addresses. This TwoD router is also a key element in our current effort towards
two dimensional IP routing. With one more dimension, the forwarding table will
grow explosively given a straightforward implementation. As a result, it is
impossible to fit the forwarding table to the current TCAM, which is the de
facto standard despite its limited capacity. To solve the explosion problem, we
propose a forwarding table structure with a novel separation of TCAM and SRAM.
As such, we move the redundancies in expensive TCAM to cheaper SRAM, while the
lookup speed is comparable with conventional routers. We also design the
incremental update algorithms that minimize the number of accesses to memory.
We evaluate our design with a real implementation on a commercial router,
Bit-Engine 12004, with real data sets. Our design does not need new devices,
which is favorable for adoption. The results also show that the performance of

perfectly conducting viscous liquid, such as a liquid metal, is known to
develop an accelerating protrusion resembling a cusp with a conic tip. Field
self-enhancement from tip sharpening is reported to generate divergent power
law growth in finite time of the forces acting in that region. Previous studies
have established that tip sharpening proceeds via a self-similar process in two
distinct limits - the Stokes regime at $\textsf{Re}=0$ and the inviscid regime
$\textsf{Re} \to \infty$. Using finite element simulations to track the
acceleration of an electrified protrusion in a perfectly conducting Newtonian
liquid in vacuum held at constant capillary number, we demonstrate that the
conic tip \textit{always} undergoes self-similar growth irrespective of
Reynolds number. The computed blow up exponents at the tip for the terms in the
Navier-Stokes equation and interface normal stress condition reveal the
different forces at play as $\textsf{Re}$ increases. Rescaling of the tip shape
by the capillary stress exponent yields excellent collapse onto a universal
conic tip shape with interior half-angle dependent on the magnitude of the
Maxwell stress. The rapid acceleration of the liquid interface also generates a
thin surface boundary layer with very high local strain rate. Additional
details of the modeled flow, applicable to cone growth in systems such as
liquid metal ion sources, help dispel prevailing misconceptions that dynamic
cones resemble conventional Taylor cones or that viscous stresses at finite

canonical ensemble directly from molecular dynamics. Unlike Monte Carlo
algorithms dynamical flow models are often not ergodic and so can fail to
reproduce Gibbs' ensembles. Accordingly we include a discussion of ergodicity,
the visiting of all relevant microstates corresponding to the desired ensemble.
We consider Lyapunov instability too, the usual mechanism for phase-space
mixing. We show that thermostated harmonic oscillator dynamics can be
simultaneously expanding, incompressible, or contracting, depending upon the
chosen ""phase space"". The fractal nature of nonequilibrium flows is also
illustrated for two simple two-dimensional models, the hard-disk-based Galton
Board and the time-reversible Baker Map. The simultaneous treatment of flows as
one-dimensional and many-dimensional suggests some interesting topological

promising new algebraic approach to constrained counting makes use of tensor

determining an efficient order to contract the tensors inside the network,

  In this work, we apply graph decompositions to find contraction orders for

used both to find carving decompositions and to factor tensor networks with
high-rank, structured tensors.

various sources of incoherent noise acting during the cost-evaluation circuit.
Our main results are rigorous theorems stating that the optimal variational

the quantum Fourier transform, Toffoli gate, and W-state preparation. Hence,
variational quantum compiling, due to its robustness, could be practically

stereo (MVS). Distinct from existing cost volume approaches, our method
directly processes the target scene as point clouds. More specifically, our
method predicts the depth in a coarse-to-fine manner. We first generate a
coarse depth map, convert it into a point cloud and refine the point cloud
iteratively by estimating the residual between the depth of the current
iteration and that of the ground truth. Our network leverages 3D geometry
priors and 2D texture information jointly and effectively by fusing them into a
feature-augmented point cloud, and processes the point cloud to estimate the 3D
flow for each point. This point-based architecture allows higher accuracy, more
computational efficiency and more flexibility than cost-volume-based
counterparts. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a
significant improvement in reconstruction quality compared with
state-of-the-art methods on the DTU and the Tanks and Temples dataset. Our

the efficiency of optimization for wavefunctions with a large number of

very inexpensive, and only switch to the direct linear method near the end of
the optimization where methods such as AMSGrad have long convergence tails. We
apply this improved optimizer to various wavefunctions with both real and

We assign to each geographical node a concave and increasing reward function

dispatch policy of which nodes to visit at what time and by what agent by
finding a policy set that maximizes a utility that is defined as the total
reward collected at visit times. We show that this optimization problem is
NP-hard and its computational complexity increases exponentially with the
number of the agents and the length of the mission horizon. By showing that the
utility function is a monotone increasing and submodular set function of
agents' policy, we proceed to propose a suboptimal dispatch policy design with
a known optimality gap. To reduce the time complexity of constructing the
feasible search set and also to induce robustness to changes in the operational
factors, we perform our suboptimal policy design in a receding horizon fashion.
Then, to compensate for the shortsightedness of the receding horizon approach
for reward distribution beyond the feasible policies of the agents over the
receding horizon, we add a new term to our utility, which provides a measure of
nodal importance beyond the receding horizon's sight. This term gives the
policy design an intuition to steer the agents towards the nodes with higher
rewards on the patrolling graph. Finally, we discuss how our proposed algorithm

our results.

more than half the stars in the field, including those not associated with

stars in this field are $\alpha$-enhanced at lower metallicities, while
[$\alpha$/Fe] decreases with increasing [Fe/H] above metallicities of [Fe/H]
$\gtrsim -0.9$. Three kinematical components have been previously identified in

[Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution functions for each of the components. The
giant stellar stream and the second kinematically cold feature have very
similar abundance distributions, while the halo component is more metal-poor.
Although the current sample sizes are small, a comparison of the abundances of

has created ubiquitous concerns of cyber threats for enterprise system
managers. It is common that the asset owners and enterprise network operators
need to work with cybersecurity professionals to manage the risk by
remunerating them for their efforts that are not directly observable. In this
paper, we use a principal-agent framework to capture the service relationships
between the two parties, i.e., the asset owner (principal) and the cyber risk
manager (agent). Specifically, we consider a dynamic systemic risk management
problem with asymmetric information where the principal can only observe cyber
risk outcomes of the enterprise network rather than directly the efforts that
the manager expends on protecting the resources. Under this information
pattern, the principal aims to minimize the systemic cyber risks by designing a
dynamic contract that specifies the compensation flows and the anticipated
efforts of the manager by taking into account his incentives and rational
behaviors. We formulate a bi-level mechanism design problem for dynamic
contract design within the framework of a class of stochastic differential
games. We show that the principal has rational controllability of the systemic
risk by designing an incentive compatible estimator of the agent's hidden
efforts. We characterize the optimal solution by reformulating the problem as a
stochastic optimal control program which can be solved using dynamic
programming. We further investigate a benchmark scenario with complete
information and identify conditions that yield zero information rent and lead
to a new certainty equivalence principle for principal-agent problems. Finally,
case studies over networked systems are carried out to illustrate the
theoretical results obtained.

specialize the function(s) they perform. A recent model of network growth based
on this notion of specialization has been able to reproduce some of the most
well-known topological features found in real-world networks including
right-skewed degree distributions, the small world property, modular as well as
hierarchical topology, etc. Here we describe how specialization under this
model also effects the spectral properties of a network. This allows us to give
conditions under which a network is able to maintain its dynamics as its
topology evolves. Specifically, we show that if a network is intrinsically
stable, which is a stronger version of the standard notion of global stability,
then the network maintains this type of dynamics as the network evolves. This
is one of the first steps toward unifying the rigorous study of the two types
of dynamics exhibited by networks. These are the \emph{dynamics of} a network,
which is the study of the topological evolution of the network's structure,
modeled here by the process of network specialization, and the \emph{dynamics

type of dynamics we consider is global stability. The main examples we apply
our results to are recurrent neural networks, which are the basis of certain
types of machine learning algorithms.

the contact angle at the solid boundary. In this work, we aim at investigating
the implementation of contact angles in the pseudopotential LB simulations with
curved boundaries. In the pseudopotential LB model, the contact angle is
usually realized by employing a solid-fluid interaction or specifying a
constant virtual wall density. However, it is shown that the solid-fluid
interaction scheme yields very large spurious currents in the simulations
involving curved boundaries, while the virtual-density scheme produces an
unphysical thick mass-transfer layer near the solid boundary although it gives
much smaller spurious currents. We also extend the geometric-formulation scheme
in the phase-field method to the pseudopotential LB model. Nevertheless, in
comparison with the solid-fluid interaction scheme and the virtual-density
scheme, the geometric-formulation scheme is relatively difficult to implement
for curved boundaries and cannot be directly applied to three-dimensional
space. By analyzing the features of these three schemes, we propose an improved
virtual-density scheme to implement contact angles in the pseudopotential LB
simulations with curved boundaries, which does not suffer from a thick
mass-transfer layer near the solid boundary and retains the advantages of the
original virtual-density scheme, i.e., simplicity, easiness for implementation,
and low spurious currents.

A graduated cylindrical shell model, an analytical model without free

to connect in-situ signatures at the Earth and Ulysses, respectively. We find
that each of the 7 CME-driven shocks experienced a major deceleration before
reaching 1 au and thereafter propagated with a gradual deceleration from the
Earth to larger distances. The resulting CME/shock propagation profile for each
case is roughly consistent with all the data, which verifies the usefulness of
the simple analytical model for CME/shock propagation in the heliosphere. The
statistical analysis of CME kinematics indicates a tendency that the faster the
CME, the larger the deceleration, and the shorter the deceleration time period
within 1 au. For several of these events, the associated geomagnetic storms
were mainly caused by the southward magnetic fields in the sheath region. In
particular, the interaction between a CME-driven shock and a preceding ejecta
significantly enhanced the preexisting southward magnetic fields and gave rise

the conventional approach of combining different data sets (such as X-rays,

for each cluster, our method requires only a single data set, such as X-ray
observations or Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect observations, consisting of
sufficiently large number of clusters. Instead of reconstructing the 3-D shape
of an individual object, we recover the probability distribution function (PDF)
of the 3-D shapes of the observed galaxy clusters. The shape PDF is the
relevant statistical quantity which can be compared with the theory and used to
test the cosmological models. We apply this method to publicly available
\emph{Chandra} X-ray data of 89 well resolved galaxy clusters. Assuming
ellipsoidal shapes, we find that our sample of galaxy clusters is a mixture of
prolate and oblate shapes, with a preference for oblateness with the most
probable ratio of principle axes 1.4 : 1.3 : 1. The ellipsoidal assumption is
not essential to our approach and our method is directly applicable to
non-ellipsoidal shapes. Our method is insensitive to the radial density and
temperature profiles of the cluster. Our method is sensitive to the changes in
shape of the X-ray emitting gas from inner to outer regions and we find
evidence for variation in the 3-D shape of the X-ray emitting gas with distance

systems and partial differential equations (PDE). The goal of such work is
discovering unknown physics and the corresponding equations. However, prior to
achieving this goal, major challenges remain to be resolved, including learning
PDE under noisy data and limited discrete data. To overcome these challenges,
in this work, a deep-learning based data-driven method, called DL-PDE, is
developed to discover the governing PDEs of underlying physical processes. The
DL-PDE method combines deep learning via neural networks and data-driven
discovery of PDE via sparse regressions. In the DL-PDE, a neural network is
first trained, and then a large amount of meta-data is generated, and the
required derivatives are calculated by automatic differentiation. Finally, the
form of PDE is discovered by sparse regression. The proposed method is tested
with physical processes, governed by groundwater flow equation,
convection-diffusion equation, Burgers equation and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)
equation, for proof-of-concept and applications in real-world engineering
settings. The proposed method achieves satisfactory results when data are noisy
and limited.

multiple values for an attribute or a relationship, as well as the provenance
descriptions of the values. Provenance descriptions of a value provide the
settings of the value, such as validity periods, sources, security
requirements, etc. This paper presents the architecture for the entity linking
system, the logical, physical, and indexing models used in the system, and the
general linking process. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of update
operations of the physical storage models when the system is implemented in two

random vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$, given $n$ i.i.d. samples. The goal is to
design an efficient estimator that attains the optimal sub-gaussian error
bound, only assuming that the random vector has bounded mean and covariance.
Polynomial-time solutions to this problem are known but have high runtime due
to their use of semi-definite programming (SDP). Conceptually, it remains open
whether convex relaxation is truly necessary for this problem.
  In this work, we show that it is possible to go beyond SDP and achieve better
computational efficiency. In particular, we provide a spectral algorithm that
achieves the optimal statistical performance and runs in time $\widetilde
O\left(n^2 d \right)$, improving upon the previous fastest runtime $\widetilde
O\left(n^{3.5}+ n^2d\right)$ by Cherapanamjeri el al. (COLT '19). Our algorithm
is spectral in that it only requires (approximate) eigenvector computations,
which can be implemented very efficiently by, for example, power iteration or
the Lanczos method.
  At the core of our algorithm is a novel connection between the furthest
hyperplane problem introduced by Karnin et al. (COLT '12) and a structural
lemma on heavy-tailed distributions by Lugosi and Mendelson (Ann. Stat. '19).
This allows us to iteratively reduce the estimation error at a geometric rate

driven by an adversarial sub-network. The ROI-fusion layer not only fuses the
individual cartilages from multiple agents, but also backpropagates the
training loss from the adversarial sub-network to each agent to enable joint
learning of shape and spatial constraints. Extensive evaluations are conducted
on a dataset including hundreds of MR knee volumes with diverse populations,

of fake news. Fake-news images, images attached in fake news posts,include not
only fake images which are maliciously tampered but also real images which are
wrongly used to represent irrelevant events. Hence, how to fully exploit the
inherent characteristics of fake-news images is an important but challenging
problem for fake news detection. In the real world, fake-news images may have
significantly different characteristics from real-news images at both physical
and semantic levels, which can be clearly reflected in the frequency and pixel

pixel domains for detecting fake news. Specifically, we design a CNN-based
network to automatically capture the complex patterns of fake-news images in
the frequency domain; and utilize a multi-branch CNN-RNN model to extract
visual features from different semantic levels in the pixel domain. An
attention mechanism is utilized to fuse the feature representations of

negligible effect. Using the surface flux transport model, we show that the
morphological asymmetry of leading and following sunspots has a significant
impact on the evolution of the large-scale magnetic field on the solar surface.
By evaluating the effect of the morphological asymmetry of each bipolar
magnetic region (BMR), we observe that the introduction of the asymmetry in the
BMR model significantly reduces its contribution to the polar magnetic field,
especially for large and high-latitude BMRs. Strongly asymmetric BMRs can even
reverse the regular polar field formation. The surface flux transport
simulations based on the observed sunspot record shows that the introduction of
the morphological asymmetry reduces the root-mean-square difference from the

  The 10th DICE workshop explores the area of Implicit Computational Complexity
(ICC), which grew out from several proposals to use logic and formal methods to
provide languages for complexity-bounded computation (e.g. Ptime, Logspace
computation). It aims at studying the computational complexity of programs
without referring to external measuring conditions or a particular machine
model, but only by considering language restrictions or logical/computational
principles entailing complexity properties. Several approaches have been
explored for that purpose, such as restrictions on primitive recursion and
ramification, rewriting systems, linear logic, types and lambda calculus,
interpretations of functional and imperative programs.
  The 6th FOPARA workshop serves as a forum for presenting original research
results that are relevant to the analysis of resource (e.g. time, space,
energy) consumption by computer programs. The workshop aims to bring together
the researchers that work on foundational issues with the researchers that
focus more on practical results. Therefore, both theoretical and practical
contributions are encouraged. We also encourage papers that combine theory and
practice.

(like) atoms in the electronic $^1$S$_0$ state ($g$-state) and $^3$P$_0$ state
($e$-state), which are confined in a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) tube. In
addition, in the axial direction, the $g$-atom experience a 1D optical lattice
and the $e$-atom is localized by a harmonic potential. In this work, we propose
two appropriate tight-binding models, which are applicable for the cases that
the odd-wave scattering between the $g$- and $e$-atom is negligible or not,
respectively. We further give a microscopic derivation for the inter-atomic
interaction parameters of these tight-binding models, by exactly calculating
the low-energy inter-atomic scattering amplitude. Our results show that, as one
can predict, these interaction parameters can be efficiently controlled by the
confinement potentials. We further exam the simple ""projection approximation""
with which one derives the interaction parameters by directly projecting the 3D
Huang-Yang pseudopotential on the ground state of the confinement and the
lowest band of the optical lattice. We find that one should be very careful
about determining the interaction parameters in the tight-binding models.
Furthermore, we calculate the spin-exchanging rate, which dependents on the
incident quasi-momentum $k$ of the $g$-atom, for the recent experiment (L.
Riegger, {\it et. al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 120}, 143601 (2018)) of
$^{173}$Yb atoms in this quasi-(1+0)D system, and study finite-momentum effect
in this experiment. Our results show that in this system the finite-momentum
effect of the $g$-atom is very significant, and the momentum of the $g$-atoms
in this experiment may be pretty high (already in the second Brillouin zone of
the optical lattice)

spatially-heterogeneous changes, involving differentiation of neuronal types,
dendritic arborization, axonal ingrowth, outgrowth and retraction,
synaptogenesis, and myelination. To better quantify these changes, this article
presents a method for probing tissue microarchitecture by characterizing water
diffusion in a spectrum of length scales, factoring out the effects of
intra-voxel orientation heterogeneity. Our method is based on the spherical
means of the diffusion signal, computed over gradient directions for a fixed
set of diffusion weightings (i.e., b-values). We decompose the spherical mean
series at each voxel into a spherical mean spectrum (SMS), which essentially
encodes the fractions of spin packets undergoing fine- to coarse-scale
diffusion processes, characterizing hindered and restricted diffusion stemming
respectively from extra- and intra-neurite water compartments. From the SMS,
multiple orientation distribution invariant indices can be computed, allowing
for example the quantification of neurite density, microscopic fractional
anisotropy ($\mu$FA), per-axon axial/radial diffusivity, and free/restricted
isotropic diffusivity. We show maps of these indices for baby brains,
demonstrating that microscopic tissue features can be extracted from the
developing brain for greater sensitivity and specificity to development related
changes. Also, we demonstrate that our method, called spherical mean spectrum
imaging (SMSI), is fast, accurate, and can overcome the biases associated with
other state-of-the-art microstructure models.

performance counters in Hypervisors. In this work, we propose uPredict, a
user-level profiler-based performance predictive framework for single-VM
applications in multi-tenant clouds. Here, three micro-benchmarks are specially
devised to assess the contention of CPUs, memory and disks in a VM,
respectively. Based on measured performance of an application and
micro-benchmarks, the application and VM-specific predictive models can be
derived by exploiting various regression and neural network based techniques.
These models can then be used to predict the application's performance using
the in-situ profiled resource contention with the micro-benchmarks. We
evaluated uPredict extensively with representative benchmarks from PARSEC, NAS
Parallel Benchmarks and CloudSuite, on both a private cloud and two public
clouds. The results show that the average prediction errors are between 9.8% to
17% for various predictive models on the private cloud with high resource
contention, while the errors are within 4% on public clouds. A smart
load-balancing scheme powered by uPredict is presented and can effectively
reduce the execution and turnaround times of the considered application by 19%

whose permittivity and permeability are complex numbers. The real refractive

medium in the closed channel can Pauli block, or frustrate, the two-body
scattering processes. Here, we theoretically investigate the impact of
frustration in the few- and many-body limits of the experimentally accessible

significantly suppressed, and by introducing a closed-channel Fermi sea to the

mechanisms and mitigations that can be difficult to understand, analyze, and

stack-based algorithm to help prevent these attacks by safely canonicalizing
user-supplied path strings. The goal of this algorithm is to be small, easy to
test, cross-platform compatible, and above all, intuitive. We provide a proof
of correctness and verification strategies using symbolic execution for the

has many applications such as image restoration and object removal. However,
current GAN-based inpainting models fail to explicitly consider the semantic
consistency between restored images and original images. Forexample, given a
male image with image region of one eye missing, current models may restore it
with a female eye. This is due to the ambiguity of GAN-based inpainting models:
these models can generate many possible restorations given a missing region. To
address this limitation, our key insight is that semantically interpretable
information (such as attribute and segmentation information) of input images
(with missing regions) can provide essential guidance for the inpainting
process. Based on this insight, we propose a boosted GAN with semantically
interpretable information for image inpainting that consists of an inpainting
network and a discriminative network. The inpainting network utilizes two
auxiliary pretrained networks to discover the attribute and segmentation
information of input images and incorporates them into the inpainting process
to provide explicit semantic-level guidance. The discriminative network adopts
a multi-level design that can enforce regularizations not only on overall
realness but also on attribute and segmentation consistency with the original

consistency on both attribute and segmentation level, and significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

for precisely measuring positions of stars (i.e. astrometry) if the system has
stable and well-calibrated geometric optical distortions. A calibration unit,
equipped with back-illuminated pinhole mask, can be utilized to measure
instrumental optical distortions. AO systems on the largest ground-based
telescopes, such as the W. M. Keck Observatory and the Thirty Meter Telescope
require pinhole positions known to 20 nm to achieve an astrometric precision of
0.001 of a resolution element. We characterize a photo-lithographic pinhole
mask and explore the systematic errors that result from different experimental
setups. We characterized the nonlinear geometric distortion of a simple imaging
system using the mask; and we measured 857 nm RMS of optical distortion with a
final residual of 39 nm (equivalent to 20 {\mu}as for TMT). We use a sixth
order bivariate Legendre polynomial to model the optical distortion and allow
the reference positions of the individual pinholes to vary. The nonlinear
deviations in the pinhole pattern with respect to the manufacturing design of a
square pattern are 47.2 nm +/- 4.5 nm (random) +/- 10.8 nm (systematic) over an
area of 1788 mm$^2$. These deviations reflect the additional error induced when
assuming the pinhole mask is manufactured perfectly square. We also find that
ordered mask distortions are significantly more difficult to characterize than
random mask distortions as the ordered distortions can alias into optical
camera distortion. Future design simulations for astrometric calibration units
should include ordered mask distortions. We conclude that photo-lithographic
pinhole masks are >10 times better than the pinhole masks deployed in first
generation AO systems and are sufficient to meet the distortion calibration
requirements for the upcoming thirty meter class telescopes.

exploits the time-dependent scattering formalism for typical conditions of

operates with realistic scattering states. We quantify the spin entanglement in
the final scattering channel through the pair concurrence and express it in
terms of the experimentally measurable spin-resolved $(e,2e)$ triple
differential cross sections. Besides, we consider Bell's inequality and inspect
the regimes of its violation in the final channel. We address both the pure and
the mixed initial spin state cases and uncover kinematical conditions of the
maximal entanglement of the outgoing electron pair. The numerical results for
the pair concurrence, entanglement of formation, and violation of Bell's
inequality obtained for the $(e,2e)$ ionization process of atomic hydrogen show
that the entangled electron pairs indeed can be formed in the $(e,2e)$

of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We use archival HST images for

observe that the relative sizes of nuclear rings and ring cluster surface

the significant connection observed between the CIR and bar strengths. In
addition, we observe that the CIR is closely related with the integrated
properties of the stellar population in the nuclear rings associating the rings

CIR can serve as a crucial parameter in unfolding the coupled evolution of bars

structured deformable meshes. Specifically, the network is trained to generate
a spatial arrangement of closed, deformable mesh parts, which respect the
global part structure of a shape collection, e.g., chairs, airplanes, etc. Our
key observation is that while the overall structure of a 3D shape can be
complex, the shape can usually be decomposed into a set of parts, each
homeomorphic to a box, and the finer-scale geometry of the part can be
recovered by deforming the box. The architecture of SDM-NET is that of a
two-level variational autoencoder (VAE). At the part level, a PartVAE learns a
deformable model of part geometries. At the structural level, we train a
Structured Parts VAE (SP-VAE), which jointly learns the part structure of a
shape collection and the part geometries, ensuring a coherence between global
shape structure and surface details. Through extensive experiments and
comparisons with the state-of-the-art deep generative models of shapes, we
demonstrate the superiority of SDM-NET in generating meshes with visual
quality, flexible topology, and meaningful structures, which benefit shape
interpolation and other subsequently modeling tasks.

dynamo, which reproduces the observed cyclic variations of the global magnetic
field of the Sun, as well as the differential rotation and meridional
circulation. Using this model, we explain, for the first time, the extended
22-year pattern of the solar torsional oscillations, observed as propagation of
zonal variations of the angular velocity from high latitudes to the equator
during the time equal to the full dynamo cycle. In the literature, this effect
is usually attributed to the so-called ""extended solar cycle"". In agreement
with the commonly accepted idea our model shows that the torsional oscillations
can be driven by a combinations of magnetic field effects acting on turbulent
angular momentum transport, and the large-scale Lorentz force. We find that the
22-year pattern of the torsional oscillations can result from a combined effect
of an overlap of subsequent magnetic cycles and magnetic quenching of the
convective heat transport. The latter effect results in cyclic variations of
the meridional circulation in the sunspot formation zone, in agreement with
helioseismology results. The variations of the meridional circulation together
with other drivers of the torsional oscillations maintain their migration to
the equator during the 22-year magnetic cycle, resulting in the observed
extended pattern of the torsional oscillations.

the potential applications of the CV-QKD because of the difficulty of
optimizing such codes for different low SNRs. In this paper, we propose a
rateless reconciliation protocol combined multidimensional scheme with Raptor
codes that not only maintains the rateless property but also achieves high
efficiency in different SNRs using just one degree distribution. It
significantly decreases the complexity of optimization and increases the
robustness of the system. Using this protocol, the CV-QKD system can operate
with the optimal modulation variance which maximizes the secret key rate.
Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can achieve reconciliation
efficiency of more than 95% within the range of SNR from -20 dB to 0 dB. It
also shows that we can obtain a high secret key rate at arbitrary distances in
a certain range and achieve a secret key rate of about 5*10^(-4) bits/pulse at
a maximum distance of 132 km (corresponding SNR is -20dB) that is higher than
previous works. The proposed protocol can maintain high efficient key
extraction under the wide range of SNRs and paves the way toward the practical
application of CV-QKD systems in flexible scenarios.

For the odd order of Legendre polynomial, the center of shadow oscillates along
the direction which is vertical to equatorial plane. For even l, the center of
shadow does not move, but the shadow alternately stretches and squeezes with

applications. For instance, in the health-care domain, when training an AI
system for predicting patient metrics from lab tests, obtaining every single
measurement comes with a high cost. Active learning, where only the label is
associated with a cost does not apply to such problem, because performing all

unnecessary due to redundancy. We propose Icebreaker, a principled framework to

BELGAM performs significantly better than the previous VAE (Variational

robustness of this protocol against imperfections in realistic setups,
particularly the multiple-photon pair components emitted by practical

pilot sequences and the intermittent pattern of device activity. Nowadays, most
of the related works are based on independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) channels. However, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
channels are not always i.i.d. in realistic outdoor wireless propagation
environments. In this paper, a device grouping and pilot set allocation
algorithm is proposed for the uplink massive MIMO systems over spatially
correlated Rayleigh fading channels. Firstly, devices are divided into multiple
groups, and the channel covariance matrixes of devices within the same group
are approximately orthogonal. In each group, a dedicated pilot set is assigned.
Then active devices perform random pilot and data access process. The mean
square error of channel estimation (MSE-CE) and the spectral efficiency of this
scheme are derived, and the MSE-CE can be minimized when collision devices have
non-overlapping angle of arrival (AoA) intervals. Simulation results indicate
that the MSE-CE and spectral efficiency of this protocol are improved compared
with the traditional scheme. The MSE-CE of the proposed scheme is close to the
theoretical lower bound over a wide signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region
especially for long pilot sequence. Furthermore, the MSE-CE performance gains
are significant in high SNR and strongly correlated scenarios.

hamper the clinical applicability. Standard Helmholtz based MR-EPT methods are
severely affected by noise. Iterative reconstruction methods such as contrast
source inversion-EPT (CSI-EPT) are typically time consuming and are dependent
on their initialization. Deep learning (DL) based methods require a large
amount of training data before sufficient generalization can be achieved. Here,
we investigate the benefits achievable using a hybrid approach, i.e. using
MR-EPT or DL-EPT as initialization guesses for standard 3D CSI-EPT. Using
realistic electromagnetic simulations at 3 T and 7 T, the accuracy and
precision of hybrid CSI reconstructions are compared to standard 3D CSI-EPT
reconstructions. Our results indicate that a hybrid method consisting of an
initial DL-EPT reconstruction followed by a 3D CSI-EPT reconstruction would be
beneficial. DL-EPT combined with standard 3D CSI-EPT exploits the power of data
driven DL-based EPT reconstructions while the subsequent CSI-EPT facilitates a
better generalization by providing data consistency.

Ages are however measured only indirectly by comparing observational data with

as several non-overlapping solutions are possible. We aim at recovering the
underlying log(age) distribution from the measured log(age) probability density
function for an arbitrary set of stars. We build an age inversion method,
namely, we represent the measured log(age) probability density function as a
weighted sum of probability density functions of mono-age populations. Weights
in that sum give the underlying log(age) distribution. Mono-age populations are
simulated so that the distribution of stars on the log g-[Fe/H] plane is close
to that of the observed sample. We tested the age inversion method on simulated
data, demonstrating that it is capable of properly recovering the true log(age)
distribution for a large (N > 103) sample of stars. The method was further
applied to large public spectroscopic surveys. For RAVE-on, LAMOST and APOGEE
we also applied age inversion to mono-metallicity samples, successfully
recovering age-metallicity trends present in higher-precision APOGEE data and
chemical evolution models. We conclude that applying an age inversion method as

correlations on its WSM state expected within a single-particle picture. The
electronic kinetic energy estimated from our optical data is about half of that
obtained from single-particle ab initio calculations, which indicates
intermediate-strength electronic correlations in this system. Furthermore,
comparing the energy ratios between the interband-transition peaks at high
energies in the experimental and single-particle-ab-initio-calculation derived
optical conductivity spectra with the electronic bandwidth renormalization
factors obtained by many-body calculations enables us to estimate the
Coulomb-interaction strength (U ~ 4 eV) of electronic correlations in Co3Sn2S2.
Our many-body calculations with U ~ 4 eV show that a WSM state, which is
characterized by bulk Weyl cones and surface Fermi arcs, survives in this
correlated electron system. Besides, a sharp experimental optical conductivity
peak at low energy, which is absent in the
single-particle-ab-initio-calculation-derived optical conductivity spectrum but
is consistent with the optical conductivity peaks obtained by many-body
calculations, indicates that an electronic band connecting the two Weyl cones
is flattened by electronic correlations and emerges near the Fermi energy in
Co3Sn2S2. Our work paves the way for exploring flat-band-generated quantum
phenomena in WSMs.

applications was undertaken using the Monte Carlo radiation transport modelling
toolkit Geant4 version 10.5. The performance of the 20 different SPECT
radiation detector configurations, 4 scintillator materials (NaI(Tl), GAGG(Ce),
CsI(Tl) and LaBr$_{3}$(Ce)) and 5 thicknesses (1 to 5 mm), were determined
through the use of seven figures of merit. It was found that a crystal
thickness range of 4 to 5 mm was required for all four materials to ensure
acceptable energy resolution, sensitivity and spatial resolution performance
with the Philips DPC3200 SiPM. Any thinner than this and the performance of all
four materials was found to degrade rapidly due to a high probability of
material specific fluorescence x-ray escape after incident gamma/x-ray
photoelectric absorption. When factoring in each material's magnetic resonance
imaging compatibility, hygroscopy, and cost, it was found that CsI(Tl)
represents the most promising material to construct tileable Philips digital

intermediate-mass stars host more hot Jupiters than Sun-like stars, others
reach the conclusion that such objects are very rare. By determining the
frequencies of those planets we can test those theories.
  Based on the analysis of Kepler light curves it has been suggested that about
8 per cent of the intermediate-mass stars could have a close-in substellar
companion. This would indicate a very high frequency of such objects. Up to
now, there was no satisfactory proof or test of this hypothesis.
  We studied a previously reported sample of 166 planet candidates around
main-sequence A-type stars in the Kepler field. We selected six of them for
which we obtained extensive long-term radial velocity measurements with the
Alfred-Jensch 2-m telescope in Tautenburg and the Perek 2-m telescope in
Ond\v{r}ejov. We derive upper limits of the masses of the planet candidates. We
show that we are able to detect this kind of planet with our telescopes and
their instrumentation using the example of MASCARA-1 b.
  With the transit finding pipeline EXOTRANS we confirm that there is no single
transit event from a Jupiter-like planet in the light curves of those 166
stars. We furthermore determine that the upper limit for the occurrence rate of
close-in, massive planets for A-type stars in the Kepler sample is around 0.75
per cent.
  We argue that there is currently little evidence for a very high frequency of
close-in, massive planets of intermediate-mass stars.

the schemes, and thus can be recommended as a superior scheme for land modeling
use. Uncertainty analyses by in-situ simulations demonstrate that, over
relatively dry regions, the inter-scheme variations of soil thermal
conductivity can lead to significant differences of simulated soil temperature,
especially at deep layers, due to changes of downward soil heat conduction and
the associated freeze-thaw cycles. However, few effects appear over wet
regions, likely due to the high soil heat capacity induced by high soil
moisture levels, which increases the heat inertia in soil thermodynamics.
Global comparisons show the similar relationships that soil thermal
conductivity significantly affects the simulated soil temperature and other
related thermal and hydraulic variables over arid and semi-arid regions in mid-
and high-latitudes. These results display the role of soil thermal conductivity
in LSM, and suggest the importance of the evaluation and further development of
thermal conductivity schemes with respect to land modelling applications.

ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction(DMI) on a honeycomb lattice
with in-equivalent sub-lattices. The DMI, which acts between atoms of the same
species, differs in magnitude for the two sub-lattices, resulting in a shifting
of the energy of the magnon bands in opposite directions at the two Dirac
points. The chiral symmetry is broken and for sufficiently strong asymmetry,
the band shifting leads to anti-chiral edge states (in addition to the normal
chiral edge states) in a rectangular strip where the magnon current propagates
in the same direction along the two edges. This is compensated by a
counter-propagating bulk current that is enabled by the broken chiral symmetry.
We analyze the resulting magnon current profile across the width of the system
in details and suggest realistic experimental probes to detect them. Finally,
we propose a material that can potentially exhibit such anti-chiral edge
states.

High-order moments of the output distribution are estimated using the

very attractive due to reduced forward sampling and deterministic nature of the
propagation strategy. The methodology is applied on a wet clutch system for

is, first, to generate multiple estimates for the camera pose from which a

by which light emitted by a fast moving sources is lensed towards the direction
of motion -- can be easily extended to model the signal from both the star and
any secondary companions. Most companions will be cooler and less massive than
their host star. Their lower mass leads to faster orbital velocities, and thus
a potentially larger beaming effect. The lower temperature will mean that most
of their light is emitted at longer wavelengths, where the relative photometric
dominance of the primary is reduced. Thus for some systems, the secondary
companion can be the main contributor to observed relativistic beaming signals
at long wavelengths. Furthermore, if the system is observed over a range of
wavelengths we can independently constrain the temperature of the companion,
and the mass and radius ratio of the binary. To conclude I discuss the current
and future observational prospects of this signal, using the properties of
known exoplanets to show that such a signal may be observable by upcoming
surveys.

24 and 48 Dirac fermions on the lattice. For these number of flavors asymptotic
freedom is lost and the theories are governed by a gaussian fixed point at low
energies. In the ultraviolet they can develop a physical cutoff and therefore
be trivial, or achieve an interacting safe fixed point and therefore be
fundamental at all energy scales. We demonstrate that the gradient flow method
can be successfully implemented and applied to determine the renormalized
running coupling when asymptotic freedom is lost. Additionally, we prove that
our analysis is connected to the gaussian fixed point as our results nicely
match with the perturbative beta function. Intriguingly, we observe that it is
hard to achieve large values of the renormalized coupling on the lattice. This
might be an early sign of the existence of a physical cutoff and imply that a
larger number of flavors is needed to achieve the safe fixed point. A more
conservative interpretation of the results is that the current lattice action
is unable to explore the deep ultraviolet region where safety might emerge. Our
work constitutes an essential step towards determining the ultraviolet fate of

magnetic, electric and structural transitions. We present here the systematic
study on the effect of Sr doping at the Dy site of DyMn$_2$O$_5$ through
magnetic and dielectric measurements. Doping of divalent Sr at the Dy site is
expected to enhance the Mn$^{4+}$:Mn$^{3+}$ ratio and it will also dilute the
Dy site. Our study indicates large enhancement in the magnetic anomaly observed
close to 43 K, which we believe to be related to the increased ferromagnetic
correlations on Sr doping. Gradual increase in coercive field at 3 K with the
Sr doping and decrease in bond length of adjacent Mn$^{4+}$ ions further
support the enhancement of ferromagnetic corelations in the system. The parent
sample shows a large magnetocaloric effect around 12 K, the magnitude of which
found to decrease with increasing Sr concentration. The doping also enhances
the anomaly at around 28 K observed in the dielectric permittivity versus
temperature data, and this anomaly was earlier claimed to be associated with
the spin reorientation as well as a simultaneous transition from one
ferroelectric state to other. The electric orderings observed below 25 K are
found to be susceptible to the applied magnetic field, and supports the view of

from the destruction of small bodies on highly eccentric ($>0.99$) orbits.
Despite their importance, these minor planets have coupled physical and orbital
evolution which has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present a novel
approach for estimating the influence of fast chaotic rotation on the orbital
evolution of high-eccentricity triaxial asteroids, and formally characterize
the propagation of their angular rotation velocities and orbital elements as
random time processes. By employing the impulse approximation, we demonstrate
that the violent gravitational interactions during periastron passages transfer
energy between the orbit and asteroid's rotation. If the distribution of spin
impulses were symmetric around zero, then the net result would be a secular
decrease of the semimajor axis and a further increase of the eccentricity. We
find evidence, however, that the chaotic rotation may be self-regulated in such
a manner that these effects are reduced or nullified. We discover that
asteroids on highly eccentric orbits can break themselves apart --- in a type
of YORP-less rotational fission --- without actually entering the Roche radius,
with potentially significant consequences for the distribution of debris and
energy requirements for gravitational scattering in metal-polluted white dwarf
planetary systems. This mechanism provides a steady stream of material
impacting a white dwarf without rapidly depleting the number of small bodies in
the stellar system.

fields: if $A$ is a sufficiently small subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^2$, then there
is an element in $A$ that determines $\gg |A|^{2/3}$ distinct distances to
other elements of $A$. Combined with results for large subsets
$A\subseteq\mathbb{F}_q^2$, this improves all previously known lower bounds on
distinct distances over finite fields.
  In fact, we obtain an upper bound for the number of isosceles triangles
determined by $A$. For that we use the concept of bisector energy. It turns out
that the latter can be expressed as a point-plane incidence bound, so one can
use a theorem of the third author.
  The conversion to this incidence problem relies on the Blaschke-Gr\""unwald
kinematic mapping -- an embedding of the group of rigid motions of
$\mathbb{F}_q^2$ into an open subset of the projective three space. This has
long been known in kinematics and geometric algebra; we provide a proof for
arbitrary fields using Clifford algebras.

in cosmology which governs our understanding of structure formation and dark
energy. However, current measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, show a
significant tension ($\sim 4-6\sigma$) between early- and late-Universe
observations. There are ongoing efforts to check the diverse observational
results and also to investigate possible theoretical ways to resolve the
tension~-- which could point to radical extensions of the standard model. Here
we demonstrate the potential of next-generation spectroscopic galaxy surveys to
shed light on the Hubble constant tension. Surveys such as those with Euclid
and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are expected to reach sub-percent
precision on Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements of the Hubble
parameter, with a combined redshift coverage of $0.1<z<3$. This wide redshift
range, together with the high precision and low level of systematics in BAO
measurements, mean that these surveys will provide independent and tight
constraints on $H(z)$. These $H(z)$ measurements can be extrapolated to $z = 0$
to provide constraints on $H_0$ using a non-parametric regression. To this end
we deploy Gaussian processes and we find that Euclid-like surveys can reach
$\sim$3\% precision on $H_0$, with SKA-like intensity mapping surveys reaching
$\sim$2\%. When we combine the low-redshift SKA-like Band 2 survey with either
its high-redshift Band 1 counterpart, or with the non-overlapping Euclid-like
survey, the precision is predicted to be close to 1\% with 40 $H(z)$ data
points. This would be sufficient to rule out the current early- or
late-Universe measurements at a $\sim$5$\sigma$ level.

detected by photomultiplier tubes is sampled at 1 GHz. In nominal data
acquisition (charge) mode, this signal is integrated over a fixed window of 16
ns in case trigger conditions are met. Thanks to the electronics upgrade of the
four H.E.S.S. I cameras in spring 2017, full 1 GHz-sampled waveforms can be
read out in parallel to the nominal charge mode. This allows for a higher
flexibility in data analysis like signal integration along the signal time
gradient, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and thus the sensitivity
at the lower end of the energy range. Furthermore, it prevents the truncation
of Cherenkov events lasting longer than 16 ns, enhancing the shower
reconstruction of gamma-ray events with TeV energies and high impact distances.
Observations of PeVatron candidates may profit a lot from this new data

recurrent neural network (RNN) models. Recently, there has been increasing
interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these
modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and
consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A
recent paper claims that `Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace,
2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that
such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it
needs to take into account all elements of the model, using a rigorous
experimental design. We propose four alternative tests to determine
when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights
baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a
diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an
end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful
interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when
reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the
simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness
of attention mechanisms for explainability.

is instance A > instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction by
placing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, the
new instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments on

and ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2P
provides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relation
to its comparable neighbors. Interpretable models are highly desirable when

dependence edge contraction. The SDG is first constructed from the program,
which is then collapsed into a segment graph that captures dependence between
subtasks. An intermediate representation for data and control dependencies
among statements keeps the technique language independent. The approach is
evaluated on four case studies, including three from the open source domain,

using the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. These data were supported by optical
data from the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to show the circumstellar disc
activity. Matter from this disc accretes onto the neutron star, giving rise to
the X-ray outburst as seen in the synchronous evolution of the optical and
X-ray lightcurves. Using data taken with OGLE we show that the circumstellar
disc has exhibited stable behaviour over two decades. A positive correlation is
seen between the colour and magnitude from the OGLE and MACHO observations,
which indicates that the disc is orientated at relatively low inclination
angles. From the OGLE and Swift data, we demonstrate that the system has shown
relative phase offsets that have persisted for many years. The spin period
derivative is seen to be at maximum spin-up at phases when the mass accretion
rate is at maximum. We show that the neutron star in SXP 91.1 is an unusual
member of its class in that it has had a consistent spin period derivative over
many years, with the average spin-up rate being one of the highest for known
SMC pulsars. The most recent measurements of the spin-up rate reveal higher
values than the global trend, which is attributed to the recent mass accretion
event leading to the current outburst.

Owing to the absorption of two-photon pair production

appear in the radiation spectrum of GRBs. We search such kind of high-energy
cutoff in GRB 160625B, which is one of the brightest bursts in recent years. It
is found that the high-energy spectral cutoff is obvious for the first pulse in
the second emission episode of GRB 160625B (i.e., $\sim$186-192 s after the
burst first trigger), which is smooth and well-shaped. Then, we estimate the
Lorentz factor and radiation location of the jet shell associated with the
first pulse in the second emission episode of GRB 160625B. It is found that the
radiation location increases with time. In addition, the Lorentz factor remains
almost constant during the expansion of the jet shell. This reveals that the
magnetization of the jet is low or intermediate in the emission region, event
though the jet could be still Poynting flux dominated at smaller radii to avoid
a bright thermal component in the emission episode.

this work, it is shown that the subsequent and simultaneous catalytic functions
gives rise to an algebraic structure of a semigroup with the additional

broadening the prior in such cases may be inappropriate or impossible in some
applications. Hence our previous solution to this problem, known as posterior
repartitioning (PR), redefines the prior and likelihood while keeping their
product fixed, so that the posterior inferences and evidence estimates remain
unchanged, but the efficiency of the NS process is significantly increased. In
its most practical form, PR raises the prior to some power beta, which is
introduced as an auxiliary variable that must be determined on a case-by-case
basis, usually by lowering beta from unity according to some pre-defined
`annealing schedule' until the resulting inferences converge to a consistent
solution. Here we present a very simple yet powerful alternative Bayesian
approach, in which beta is instead treated as a hyperparameter that is inferred
from the data alongside the original parameters of the problem, and then
marginalised over to obtain the final inference. We show through numerical
examples that this Bayesian PR (BPR) method provides a very robust,
self-adapting and computationally efficient `hands-off' solution to the problem
of unrepresentative priors in Bayesian inference using NS. Moreover, unlike the
original PR method, we show that even for representative priors BPR has a
negligible computational overhead relative to standard nesting sampling, which
suggests that it should be used as the default in all NS analyses.

$\mathbb{R}^n$, equipped with the standard Euclidean metric. The flow is
entirely determined by the manifold and the Riemannian metric. Typically,
geodesic flows are perturbed by varying the metric. In the present paper,
however, only the Euclidean metric is used, and instead the manifold $M$ is
perturbed. In this context, analogues of the following theorems are proved: the
bumpy metric theorem; a theorem of Klingenberg and Takens regarding generic
properties of $k$-jets of Poincar\'e maps along geodesics; and the Kupka-Smale
theorem. Moreover, the proofs presented here are valid in the real-analytic
topology. Together, these results imply the following two main theorems: if $M$
is a real-analytic closed hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (with $n \geq 3$) on
which the geodesic flow with respect to the Euclidean metric has a
nonhyperbolic periodic orbit, then $C^{\omega}$-generically the geodesic flow
on $M$ with respect to the Euclidean metric has a hyperbolic periodic orbit
with a transverse homoclinic orbit; and there is a $C^{\omega}$-open and dense
set of real-analytic, closed, and strictly convex surfaces $M$ in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ on which the geodesic flow with respect to the Euclidean metric
has a hyperbolic periodic orbit with a transverse homoclinic orbit. The methods
used here also apply to the classical setting of perturbations of metrics on a
Riemannian manifold to obtain real-analytic versions of these theorems in that
case. These are among the first perturbation-theoretic results for
real-analytic geodesic flows.

for the long burst. We further demonstrate that these positive correlations
also exist in the cosmological rest frame; that is, the spectral width
correlates with the isotropic-equivalent energy E iso as well as the
isotropic-equivalent peak luminosity L iso for different energy bands and
timescales. Our results show that the wider bursts have larger energy and
luminosity. Moreover, short bursts would appear to extend this trend
qualitatively. Taking the Amati relation into account, we tend to believe that
the spectral shape is related to energy and luminosity.

series in signal analysis, referred to as either nonlinear phase unwinding or
adaptive Fourier decomposition. In these processes, a signal is represented as
the real component of a complex function $F: \partial\mathbb{D}\to \mathbb{C}$,
and by performing an iterative method to obtain a sequence of Blaschke
decompositions, the signal can be approximated using only a few terms. To
better understand the convergence of these methods, the study of Blaschke
decompositions on weighted Hardy spaces was studied by Coifman and
Steinerberger, under the assumption that the complex valued function $F$ has an
analytic extension to $\mathbb{D}_{1+\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon>0$. This
provided bounds on weighted Hardy norms involving a function and its Blaschke
decomposition. That work also noted that in many examples, the nonlinear
unwinding series of a function converges at an exponential rate to the original
signal, which when coupled with an efficient algorithm to perform a Blaschke
decomposition, has lead to a new and efficient way to approximate signals.
  In this work, we continue the study of Blaschke decompositions on weighted
Hardy Spaces for functions in the larger space $\mathcal{H}^2(\mathbb{D})$
under the assumption that the function has finitely many roots in $\mathbb{D}$.
By studying the growth rate of the weights, we improve the bounds provided by
Coifman and Steinerberger. This provides us with new insights into Blaschke
decompositions on classical function spaces including the Hardy-Sobolev spaces
and weighted Bergman spaces. Further, we state a sufficient condition on the
weights for our improved bounds to hold for any function in the Hardy space,
$\mathcal{H}^2(\mathbb{D})$. These results may help to better explain why the
exponential convergence of the unwinding series is seen in many numerical
examples.

reported that a lower flame temperature produced a highly porous coating, while
the porosity was reduced at higher flame temperature. Investigation of the
phase content showed that, contrary to our current understanding, a higher

analysed, showing that as the precursor travels through the flame, pyrolysis
and sintering takes place to form the solid material. These results were used
to derive a model of the physico-chemical transformation of the solution

promising technique for the deposition of doped ceramic coatings, being the

algorithms for the problem when $k \in \Omega(\log{n})$. We show that both our
new algorithms and the previous exponential-time algorithms in the literature
can be viewed through the unifying lens of constraint-satisfaction.
  Our algorithms can also count, within the same running time, the number of
occurrences of a pattern. We show that this result is close to optimal: solving
the counting problem in time $f(k) \cdot n^{o(k/\log{k})}$ would contradict the
exponential-time hypothesis (ETH). For some special classes of patterns we
obtain improved running times. We further prove that $3$-increasing and
$3$-decreasing permutations can, in some sense, embed arbitrary permutations of
almost linear length, which indicates that an algorithm with sub-exponential
running time is unlikely, even for patterns from these restricted classes.

as an application of entropic methods of inference. In ED the dynamics of the
probability distribution is driven by entropy subject to constraints that are
codified into a quantity later identified as the phase of the wave function.
The central challenge is to specify how those constraints are themselves
updated. In this paper we review and extend the ED framework in several
directions. A new version of ED is introduced in which particles follow smooth
differentiable Brownian trajectories (as opposed to non-differentiable Brownian
paths). To construct the ED we make use of the fact that the space of
probabilities and phases has a natural symplectic structure (i.e., it is a
phase space with Hamiltonian flows and Poisson brackets). Then, using an
argument based on information geometry, a metric structure is introduced. It is
shown that the ED that preserves the symplectic and metric structures -- which
is a Hamilton-Killing flow in phase space -- is the linear Schr\""odinger
equation. These developments allow us to discuss why wave functions are complex
and the connections between the superposition principle, the single-valuedness
of wave functions, and the quantization of electric charges. Finally, it is
observed that Hilbert spaces are not necessary ingredients in this
construction. They are a clever but merely optional trick that turns out to be
convenient for practical calculations.

  Dynamics","8 pages plus references",,,,"cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Continuous control and planning remains a major challenge in robotics and
machine learning. Neuroscience offers the possibility of learning from animal
brains that implement highly successful controllers, but it is unclear how to
relate an animal's behavior to control principles. Animals may not always act
optimally from the perspective of an external observer, but may still act
rationally: we hypothesize that animals choose actions with highest expected
future subjective value according to their own internal model of the world.
Their actions thus result from solving a different optimal control problem from
those on which they are evaluated in neuroscience experiments. With this
assumption, we propose a novel framework of model-based inverse rational
control that learns the agent's internal model that best explains their actions
in a task described as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).
In this approach we first learn optimal policies generalized over the entire
model space of dynamics and subjective rewards, using an extended Kalman filter
to represent the belief space, a neural network in the actor-critic framework
to optimize the policy, and a simplified basis for the parameter space. We then
compute the model that maximizes the likelihood of the experimentally
observable data comprising the agent's sensory observations and chosen actions.
Our proposed method is able to recover the true model of simulated agents
within theoretical error bounds given by limited data. We illustrate this
method by applying it to a complex naturalistic task currently used in
neuroscience experiments. This approach provides a foundation for interpreting
the behavioral and neural dynamics of highly adapted controllers in animal
brains.

Imaging (MRI) in order to prevent inadequate or delayed BM treatment. However,
BM lesion detection remains challenging partly due to their structural
similarities to normal structures (e.g., vasculature). We propose a
BM-detection framework using a single-sequence gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted
3D MRI dataset. The framework focuses on detection of smaller (< 15 mm) BM
lesions and consists of: (1) candidate-selection stage, using Laplacian of
Gaussian approach for highlighting parts of a MRI volume holding higher BM
occurrence probabilities, and (2) detection stage that iteratively processes
cropped region-of-interest volumes centered by candidates using a custom-built
3D convolutional neural network (""CropNet""). Data is augmented extensively
during training via a pipeline consisting of random gamma correction and
elastic deformation stages; the framework thereby maintains its invariance for
a plausible range of BM shape and intensity representations. This approach is
tested using five-fold cross-validation on 217 datasets from 158 patients, with
training and testing groups randomized per patient to eliminate learning bias.
The BM database included lesions with a mean diameter of ~5.4 mm and a mean
volume of ~160 mm3. For 90% BM-detection sensitivity, the framework produced on
average 9.12 false-positive BM detections per patient (standard deviation of
3.49); for 85% sensitivity, the average number of false-positives declined to
5.85. Comparative analysis showed that the framework produces comparable
BM-detection accuracy with the state-of-art approaches validated for
significantly larger lesions.

enable broader application of volumetric assessment in multi-site studies.
Transfer learning (TL) is commonly used to update the neural network weights
for local factors; yet, it is commonly recognized to risk degradation of
performance on the original validation/test cohorts. Here, we explore TL by
data augmentation to address these concerns in the context of adapting SLANT to
anatomical variation and scanning protocol. We consider two datasets: First, we
optimize for age with 30 T1w MRI of young children with manually corrected
volumetric labels, and accuracy of automated segmentation defined relative to
the manually provided truth. Second, we optimize for acquisition with 36 paired
datasets of pre- and post-contrast clinically acquired T1w MRI, and accuracy of
the post-contrast segmentations assessed relative to the pre-contrast automated
assessment. For both studies, we augment the original TL step of SLANT with
either only the new data or with both original and new data. Over baseline
SLANT, both approaches yielded significantly improved performance (signed rank
tests; pediatric: 0.89 vs. 0.82 DSC, p<0.001; contrast: 0.80 vs 0.76, p<0.001).
The performance on the original test set decreased with the new-data only

performance impact of key design features in a machine learning framework and
quantifies the role of parallelism. The observations and insights distill into
a simple set of guidelines that one can use to achieve much higher training and
inference speedup. Across a diverse set of real-world deep learning models, the
evaluation results show that the proposed performance tuning guidelines
outperform the Intel and TensorFlow recommended settings by 1.29x and 1.34x,

by a relatively strong flux. Two of the observed regions (blobs) are located in
the ISM, outside the AGN photoionization cones. The strongest Hb line flux

while the strongest Hb line flux calculated by an AGN dominated model was found
in the galaxy C bulk. O/H element abundances are near solar everywhere, while
N/H spans a factor of ~10. The radio data have different origins, thermal
bremsstrahlung and reprocessed radiation by dust. The infrared-optical

Although
they appear as distinct phenomena, new theories state that transitions between

observed because of the lack of control strategies. We introduce a new concept
of nonlinear wave topological control, based on the one-to-one correspondence
between the number of wave packet oscillating phases and the genus of toroidal
surfaces associated with the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation solutions by the
Riemann theta function. We prove it experimentally by reporting the first
observation of supervised transitions between extreme waves with different
genera, like the continuous transition from dispersive shock to rogue waves.
Specifically, we use a parametric time-dependent nonlinearity to shape the
asymptotic wave genus. We consider the box problem in a focusing Kerr-like
photorefractive medium and tailor time-dependent propagation coefficients, as
nonlinearity and dispersion, to explore each region in the state-diagram and
include all the dynamic phases in the nonlinear wave propagation. Our result is
the first example of the topological control of integrable nonlinear waves.
This new technique casts light on dispersive shock waves and rogue wave
generation, and can be extended to other nonlinear phenomena, from classical to
quantum ones. The outcome is not only important for fundamental studies and
control of extreme nonlinear waves, but can be also applied to spatial beam
shaping for microscopy, medicine and spectroscopy, and to the broadband
coherent light generation.

reduces the complexity of the periodic Parareal solution by introducing a

correction is performed, which converts the block-cyclic periodic system in the
time domain into a block-diagonal system in the frequency domain, thereby
solving for each frequency component in parallel. The convergence analysis of
the method is discussed for a one-dimensional model problem. The introduced

seminal paper, this has become a very popular approach to the multiple
comparisons problem. An increasingly popular topic within functional data
analysis is local inference, i.e., the continuous statistical testing of a null
hypothesis along the domain. The principal issue in this topic is the infinite
amount of tested hypotheses, which can be seen as an extreme case of the
multiple comparisons problem. In this paper we define and discuss the notion of
false discovery rate in a very general functional data setting. Moreover, a
continuous version of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is introduced along with
a definition of adjusted p-value function. Some general conditions are stated,
under which the functional Benjamini-Hochberg procedure provides control of the
functional FDR. Two different simulation studies are presented; the first study
has a one-dimensional domain and a comparison with another state of the art
method, and the second study has a planar two-dimensional domain. Finally, the
proposed method is applied to satellite measurements of Earth temperature. In
detail, we aim at identifying the regions of the planet where temperature has
significantly increased in the last decades. After adjustment, large areas are
still significant.

schemes for sequential tasks that include interaction-based, but often delayed

approaches, including deep reinforcement learning, still perform weakly when
compared to flexibly adaptive biological systems in certain naturally occurring
scenarios. Such scenarios include transfers to environments different than the
ones in which the training took place or environments that dynamically change,
both of which are often mastered by biological systems through a capability
that we here term ""fluid adaptivity"" to contrast it from the much slower
adaptivity (""crystallized adaptivity"") of the prior learning from which the
behavior emerged. In this article, we derive and discuss research strategies,
based on analyzes of fluid adaptivity in biological systems and its neuronal
modeling, that might aid in equipping future artificially intelligent systems
with capabilities of fluid adaptivity more similar to those seen in some
biologically intelligent systems. A key component of this research strategy is
the dynamization of the problem space itself and the implementation of this
dynamization by suitably designed flexibly interacting modules.

recognition since they can represent emotions more comprehensively. In this
paper, we introduce deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) to multimodal
emotion recognition. The basic idea behind DCCA is to transform each modality
separately and coordinate different modalities into a hyperspace by using
specified canonical correlation analysis constraints. We evaluate the
performance of DCCA on five multimodal datasets: the SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V,
DEAP, and DREAMER datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that DCCA
achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy rates on all five datasets:
94.58% on the SEED dataset, 87.45% on the SEED-IV dataset, 84.33% and 85.62%
for two binary classification tasks and 88.51% for a four-category
classification task on the DEAP dataset, 83.08% on the SEED-V dataset, and
88.99%, 90.57%, and 90.67% for three binary classification tasks on the DREAMER

methods when adding various amounts of noise to the SEED-V dataset. The
experimental results indicate that DCCA has greater robustness. By visualizing
feature distributions with t-SNE and calculating the mutual information between
different modalities before and after using DCCA, we find that the features
transformed by DCCA from different modalities are more homogeneous and
discriminative across emotions.

process of DNNs with rationales, i.e., a subset of features highlighted by
domain experts as justifications for predictions, to enforce DNNs to generate
local explanations that conform with expert rationales. Even when rationales
are not available, CREX still could be useful by requiring the generated
explanations to be sparse. Experimental results on two text classification
datasets demonstrate the increased credibility of DNNs trained with CREX.
Comprehensive analysis further shows that while CREX does not always improve
prediction accuracy on the held-out test set, it significantly increases DNN
accuracy on new and previously unseen data beyond test set, highlighting the

feature of neighboring entities and structural information to update the
embedding of currently located entity. Although the fruitful information is
beneficial to the following task, the cost of exploring the entire graph is
massive and impractical. In order to reduce the computational cost and maintain
the pattern of extracting features, KG-aware recommendation model usually
utilize fixed-size and random set of neighbors rather than complete information
in KG. Nonetheless, there are two critical issues in these approaches: First of
all, fixed-size and randomly selected neighbors restrict the view of graph. In
addition, as the order of graph feature increases, the growth of parameter
dimensionality of the model may lead the training process hard to converge. To
solve the aforementioned limitations, we propose GraphSW, a strategy based on
stage-wise training framework which would only access to a subset of the
entities in KG in every stage. During the following stages, the learned
embedding from previous stages is provided to the network in the next stage and
the model can learn the information gradually from the KG. We apply stage-wise
training on two SOTA recommendation models, RippleNet and Knowledge Graph

observed that after controlling for open access publication and the release of
code, papers based on public data were cited over 60% more per year than their
private-data counterparts. Further, we found that more than 20% of papers using
public data did not provide a citation to the dataset or associated manuscript,
highlighting the ""second-rate"" status that data contributions often take
compared to theoretical ones. We conclude by making recommendations for MICCAI
policies which could help to better incentivise data sharing and move the field
toward more efficient and reproducible science.

  Power Consumption in WSNs-based Cognitive Radio","14 pages 13 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rapid development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the significant
incentive to contribute in the vulnerable applications such as cognitive radio
(CR). This paper proposes a Stackelberg game approach to enhance the WSN-based
CR security against the spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack and
conserve the consequent lost power consumption. The attack aims to corrupt the
spectrum decision by imposing interference power to the delivered reports from
the sensor nodes (SNs) to the fusion center (FC) to make a protection level
below a specific threshold. The proposed model utilizes the intelligent
Stackelberg game features along with the matched filter (MF) to maximize the
number of protected reports sent by the SNs to the FC leading to accurate
decision of the spectrum status. Furthermore, the TDMA protocol is utilized to
resolve the complexity of employing MF for the spectrum detection to avoid the
collision between the delivered reports. The proposed model aims to enhance the
number of correctly received reports at the FC, and hence manage the lost
energy of reports retransmission due to the malicious attack effect. Moreover,
the model can conserve the lost power of the failure communication attempts due
to the SSDF attack impact. Simulation results indicate the improved performance
of the proposed protection model along with the MF over the six different
environments against the SSDF attack as compared to two defense schemes,
namely, random and equal weight defense strategies.

telecommunication system. These systems consist of users sending messages,
which can jump to other users to reach the target user. The first two models
have already been examined extensively, whereas it is the first time the third
model is studied. In all these models our goal is to understand under which
conditions users situated far away from each other can communicate. This is the
fundamental question of continuum percolation, which was introduced by Gilbert
(1961), who established the Boolean model for Poisson point processes. In the
first part of this thesis we introduce this model and prove the existence of a
phase transition between a subcritical phase, where no infinite connected
component of users exists, and a supercritical phase, where such a component
exists. We also consider the case of random connection radii, following Meester
and Roy (1996). In the second part we study the SINR model for Cox point
processes in two or higher dimensions, following T\'obi\'as (2019). He proved
that there exists a phase transition under certain stabilization and
connectedness conditions on the intensity measure. The SINR model for
homogeneous Poisson point processes in $\mathbb R^2$ was introduced by Dousse
et al. (2005). In the third part we study percolation in the SINR model with
random powers for Poisson point processes in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 2$. This
model was studied by Kong and Yeh (2007) for $d=2$ under strong boundedness
conditions on the random power. In this thesis we weaken these conditions and
only assume that the random power is nonnegative, integrable and not a.s. zero.
We show that there exists a subcritical phase if the path-loss function decays
fast enough. Further, we prove that a supercritical phase exists if random
power has a large enough essential supremum and some exponential moments.

express complex ideas, models and data in ways that words cannot. However, this
visual information is mostly ignored in analyses of the scientific literature.
In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of using scientific figures as
markers of knowledge domains in science, which can be used for classification,
recommender systems, and studies of scientific information exchange. We encode
sets of images into a visual signature, then use distances between these
signatures to understand how patterns of visual communication compare with
patterns of jargon and citation structures. We find that figures can be as
effective for differentiating communities of practice as text or citation
patterns. We then consider where these metrics disagree to understand how
different disciplines use visualization to express ideas. Finally, we further
consider how specific figure types propagate through the literature, suggesting
a new mechanism for understanding the flow of ideas apart from conventional
channels of text and citations. Our ultimate aim is to better leverage these
information-dense objects to improve scientific communication across
disciplinary boundaries.

assigns a category path to a particular product. Research in this area is
restricted by the unavailability of good real-world datasets and the variations
in taxonomy due to the absence of a standard across the different e-commerce

However, modern Internet services adopt a microservice-based architecture and
consist of various modules. The diversity of these modules and complexity of
execution paths, the massive scale and complex hierarchy of datacenter
infrastructure, the confidential issues of data sets and workloads pose great
challenges to benchmarking. In this paper, we present the first
industry-standard Internet service AI benchmark suite---AIBench with seventeen
industry partners, including several top Internet service providers. AIBench
provides a highly extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark framework
that contains loosely coupled modules. We identify sixteen prominent AI problem
domains like learning to rank, each of which forms an AI component benchmark,
from three most important Internet service domains: search engine, social
network, and e-commerce, which is by far the most comprehensive AI benchmarking
effort. On the basis of the AIBench framework, abstracting the real-world data
sets and workloads from one of the top e-commerce providers, we design and
implement the first end-to-end Internet service AI benchmark, which contains
the primary modules in the critical paths of an industry scale application and
is scalable to deploy on different cluster scales. The specifications, source

relies on the theory of isospectral matrix reductions to compute the
probability of eventually transitioning from one vertex to another in a
(biased) random walk on the network. Unlike the large majority of link
prediction techniques, this method can be used to predict links in networks
that are directed or undirected which are either weighted or unweighted. We
apply this method to a number of social, technological, and natural networks
and show that it is competitive with other link predictors often outperforming
them. We also provide a method of approximating our effective transition method
and show that aside from having much lower temporal complexity, this
approximation often provides more accurate predictions than the original
effective transition method. We also, prove a number of mathematical results
regarding our effective transition algorithm and its approximation.
